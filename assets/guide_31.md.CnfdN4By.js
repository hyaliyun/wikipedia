It is the seventh entry in the Gamera film series, after Gamera vs. Jiger, which was released the previous year. Gamera vs. Zigra stars Eiko Yanami, Reiko Kasahara, Mikiko Tsubouchi, and K≈çji Fujiyama, and features the fictional giant monsters Gamera and Zigra. Shortly after Gamera vs. Zigra was completed, the film's production studio, Daiei Film, went bankrupt. As a result, the film was distributed by Dainichi Eihai, receiving a theatrical release in Japan on July 17, 1971. The film was not released theatrically in the United States, instead being released directly to American television by King Features Entertainment in 1987. Plot Without warning, an alien spaceship attacks a Japanese Moon base. Back on Earth, young Kenichi (Kenny in the English dubbed version) Ishikawa played by Shinichi Minatsu ; his father, Dr. Yosuke (Henry in the English dubbed version) Ishikawa; his friend Helen Wallace, played by Gloria Zoellner; and her father, Dr. Tom Wallace, witness the spaceship descending into the ocean. They go to investigate, but are soon captured by a teleportation beam that brings them aboard the spaceship. Inside the spaceship, a human-looking woman appears to them and reveals that she is of an alien race called the Zigrans. By way of demonstrating Zigran technological prowess, she creates a gigantic earthquake that wreaks havoc in Japan. She had previously caused two other earthquakes, one in Peru and the other in Arabia (in the English dubbed version, it mentions instead the Indian Ocean). She then tells her prisoners of the planet Zigra's history and its great scientific advances which, unfortunately, have resulted in its destruction; but in searching for a new home, Zigra has found Earth. The woman contacts authorities on Earth and orders them to surrender, or she will kill her prisoners. Tom declares that the Zigran woman is insane and, in anger, she sends the two men into a hypnotic trance. Kenichi and Helen take action, successfully using the ship's control console to escape with their fathers. Enraged, Zigra orders the woman to go to Earth and kill the children. She says it would be simpler to kill all the people of Japan, but Zigra tells her that humans must be preserved so they can be used for food. Now Gamera, intent on discovering the identity of the alien interloper, flies in to save the day and rescues the children and their fathers. The U.N. authorities, after questioning Kenichi and Helen, resolve to attack Zigra. The Defense Force jets scramble, but the Zigran spaceship makes short work of them with its powerful lasers. The alien woman arrives on earth, disguised as a normal human, and begins her search for Kenichi and Helen. She hitches a ride with a Kamogawa Sea World dolphin trainer back to the facility, which the military is now using as its center of operations. She finds the two children, but before she can catch them, they run away from her. Gamera begins an underwater assault on the Zigran spaceship, which transforms into a giant shark-like fish when hit by Gamera's flame breath. Zigra grows larger and larger and finally halts the heroic turtle with a ray that suspends his cell activity. Immobilized, Gamera sinks into the sea. Zigra then makes contact with the people of Earth, saying that they should give up and surrender all the seas to it. Back at Sea World, the dolphin trainer and the facility's scientists discover a way to break the alien's hypnotic control with sonic waves. Thus, they manage to disable the Zigran woman, only to learn that she is actually an Earthwoman named Chikako Sugawara (Lora Lee in the English dubbed version), who had been in a Moon rover during the initial lunar attack and was captured and used by Zigra. Drs. Wallace and Ishikawa employ a bathysphere in an attempt to wake Gamera, only to find that Kenichi and Helen have stowed away on board. Zigra suddenly attacks them and again demands the immediate surrender of Earth or it will destroy the bathysphere. The U.N. commander reluctantly agrees to the alien's terms. An electrical storm approaches the bay and a couple of lightning bolts revive Gamera, who stealthily takes the bathysphere from the sea floor when Zigra is not looking and returns it to the surface. Gamera and Zigra face off a final time and Zigra, using its superior versatility underwater, slices Gamera's chest with its blade-like dorsal fin. Gamera takes hold of Zigra, flies into the air with it and then drops it at high speed, slamming the alien monster onto the land. Zigra stands up awkwardly on its tail fins in order to fight Gamera. Gamera further incapacitates Zigra by jamming a boulder through its nose, pinning it to the ground. Gamera grabs another boulder and uses it, like a mallet used to play a xylophone, to play the Gamera theme on Zigra's dorsal fins. Finally, Gamera kills Zigra by setting its body on fire with his flame breath, reducing it to ashes in a massive conflagration. Cast Production Gamera vs. Zigra had a budget of 35,000,000 yen, which was roughly $97,000. Shortly after the film was completed, its production company Daiei Film went bankrupt, leading it to be distributed by Dainichi Eihai. Release Gamera vs. Zigra was released in Japan on 17 July 1971. The film was never released theatrically in the United States. It was released directly to television by King Features Entertainment in 1987. The film was released on DVD by Shout! Factory on 15 March 2011. Reception In a retrospective review, Slant Magazine noted the films \\"slipshod construction (even by the standards of films featuring actors in rubber monster suits)\\" which \\"suggests less in the way of a thought-out film than a product cranked out so as to fulfill a McDonald‚Äôs Happy Meal toy contract.\\" The review concluded that Gamera vs. Zigra \\"isn't nearly as much fun as it should be, but for those with a cheeky fondness for city-scale monster mashes, there are some fleeting pleasures.\\" In their scholarly book Japan's Green Monsters: Environmental Commentary in Kaiju Cinema, Rhoads and McCorkle offer an ecocritical assessment of Gamera vs. Zigra. Unlike other reviews and studies that criticize some of the movie's special effects and production values, the scholars argue that viewing the film through the three lenses of Japanese environmental history, the monster genre, and the historical trends that had crippled the Japanese film industry provide a new understanding of the final installment in the original Gamera series. Rhoads and McCorkle argue that Gamera vs. Zigra possesses far deeper environmental appeals than the obvious ones present on the film's surface.

The center is 0¬∞ N 0¬∞ E. The antipode is 0¬∞ N 180¬∞ E, near Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean. That point is represented by the entire circular boundary of the map, and the ocean around that point appears along the entire boundary. The Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection with Tissot's indicatrix of deformation. The Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection is a particular mapping from a sphere to a disk. It accurately represents area in all regions of the sphere, but it does not accurately represent angles. It is named for the Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert, who announced it in 1772. \\"Zenithal\\" being synonymous with \\"azimuthal\\", the projection is also known as the Lambert zenithal equal-area projection.The Times Atlas of the World (1967), Boston: Houghton Mifflin, Plate 3, et passim. The Lambert azimuthal projection is used as a map projection in cartography. For example, the National Atlas of the US uses a Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection to display information in the online Map Maker application, and the European Environment Agency recommends its usage for European mapping for statistical analysis and display. It is also used in scientific disciplines such as geology for plotting the orientations of lines in three-dimensional space. This plotting is aided by a special kind of graph paper called a Schmidt net.Ramsay (1967) Definition cross sectional view of the sphere and a plane tangent to it at S. Each point on the sphere (except the antipode) is projected to the plane along a circular arc centered at the point of tangency between the sphere and plane. To define the Lambert azimuthal projection, imagine a plane set tangent to the sphere at some point S on the sphere. Let P be any point on the sphere other than the antipode of S. Let d be the distance between S and P in three-dimensional space (not the distance along the sphere surface). Then the projection sends P to a point P‚Ä≤ on the plane that is a distance d from S. To make this more precise, there is a unique circle centered at S, passing through P, and perpendicular to the plane. It intersects the plane in two points; let P‚Ä≤ be the one that is closer to P. This is the projected point. See the figure. The antipode of S is excluded from the projection because the required circle is not unique. The case of S is degenerate; S is projected to itself, along a circle of radius 0.Borradaile (2003). Explicit formulas are required for carrying out the projection on a computer. Consider the projection centered at on the unit sphere, which is the set of points in three-dimensional space R3 such that . In Cartesian coordinates on the sphere and on the plane, the projection and its inverse are then described by :\\\\begin{align}(X, Y) &= \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{1 - z}}\\\\, x, \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{1 - z}}\\\\, y\\\\right),  (x, y, z) &= \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{X^2 + Y^2}{4}}\\\\, X, \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{X^2 + Y^2}{4}}\\\\, Y, -1 + \\\\frac{X^2 + Y^2}{2}\\\\right).\\\\end{align} In spherical coordinates on the sphere (with œÜ the zenith and Œ∏ the azimuth) and polar coordinates on the disk, the map and its inverse are given by :\\\\begin{align}(R, \\\\Theta) &= \\\\left(2 \\\\cos \\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{2}, \\\\theta\\\\right), (\\\\varphi, \\\\theta) &= \\\\left(2 \\\\arccos\\\\frac{R}{2}, \\\\Theta\\\\right).\\\\end{align} In cylindrical coordinates on the sphere and polar coordinates on the plane, the map and its inverse are given by :\\\\begin{align}(R, \\\\Theta) &= \\\\left(\\\\sqrt{2(1 + z)}, \\\\theta\\\\right), (r, \\\\theta, z) &= \\\\left(R \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{R^2}{4}}, \\\\Theta, -1 + \\\\frac{R^2}{2}\\\\right).\\\\end{align} The projection can be centered at other points, and defined on spheres of radius other than 1, using similar formulas. Properties As defined in the preceding section, the Lambert azimuthal projection of the unit sphere is undefined at (0, 0, 1). It sends the rest of the sphere to the open disk of radius 2 centered at the origin (0, 0) in the plane. It sends the point (0, 0, ‚àí1) to (0, 0), the equator z = 0 to the circle of radius centered at (0, 0), and the lower hemisphere z < 0 to the open disk contained in that circle. The projection is a diffeomorphism (a bijection that is infinitely differentiable in both directions) between the sphere (minus (0, 0, 1)) and the open disk of radius 2. It is an area- preserving (equal-area) map, which can be seen by computing the area element of the sphere when parametrized by the inverse of the projection. In Cartesian coordinates it is :dA = dX \\\\; dY. This means that measuring the area of a region on the sphere is tantamount to measuring the area of the corresponding region on the disk. On the other hand, the projection does not preserve angular relationships among curves on the sphere. No mapping between a portion of a sphere and the plane can preserve both angles and areas. (If one did, then it would be a local isometry and would preserve Gaussian curvature; but the sphere and disk have different curvatures, so this is impossible.) This fact, that flat pictures cannot perfectly represent regions of spheres, is the fundamental problem of cartography. As a consequence, regions on the sphere may be projected to the plane with greatly distorted shapes. This distortion is particularly dramatic far away from the center of the projection (0, 0, ‚àí1). In practice the projection is often restricted to the hemisphere centered at that point; the other hemisphere can be mapped separately, using a second projection centered at the antipode. Applications The Lambert azimuthal projection was originally conceived as an equal-area map projection. It is now also used in disciplines such as geology to plot directional data, as follows. A direction in three-dimensional space corresponds to a line through the origin. The set of all such lines is itself a space, called the real projective plane in mathematics. Every line through the origin intersects the unit sphere in exactly two points, one of which is on the lower hemisphere z ‚â§ 0. (Horizontal lines intersect the equator z = 0 in two antipodal points. It is understood that antipodal points on the equator represent a single line. See quotient topology.) Hence the directions in three-dimensional space correspond (almost perfectly) to points on the lower hemisphere. The hemisphere can then be plotted as a disk of radius using the Lambert azimuthal projection. Thus the Lambert azimuthal projection lets us plot directions as points in a disk. Due to the equal-area property of the projection, one can integrate over regions of the real projective plane (the space of directions) by integrating over the corresponding regions on the disk. This is useful for statistical analysis of directional data, including random rigid rotation.Brannon, R.M., \\"Rotation, Reflection, and Frame Change\\", 2018 Not only lines but also planes through the origin can be plotted with the Lambert azimuthal projection. A plane intersects the hemisphere in a circular arc, called the trace of the plane, which projects down to a curve (typically non- circular) in the disk. One can plot this curve, or one can alternatively replace the plane with the line perpendicular to it, called the pole, and plot that line instead. When many planes are being plotted together, plotting poles instead of traces produces a less cluttered plot. Researchers in structural geology use the Lambert azimuthal projection to plot crystallographic axes and faces, lineation and foliation in rocks, slickensides in faults, and other linear and planar features. In this context the projection is called the equal-area hemispherical projection. There is also an equal-angle hemispherical projection defined by stereographic projection. The discussion here has emphasized the lower hemisphere z ‚â§ 0, but some disciplines prefer the upper hemisphere z ‚â• 0. Indeed, any hemisphere can be used to record the lines through the origin in three-dimensional space. Animated Lambert projection Animation of a Lambert projection. Each grid cell maintains its area throughout the transformation. In this animation, points on the equator remain always on the z=0 plane. In this animated Lambert projection, the south pole is held fixed. Let (u,\\\\phi) be two parameters for which -1 and 0\\\\le\\\\phi<2\\\\pi. Let H be a \\"time\\" parameter (equal to the height, or vertical thickness, of the shell in the animation). If a uniform rectilinear grid is drawn in (u,\\\\phi) space, then any point in this grid is transformed to a point (x,y,z) on a spherical shell of height H according to the mapping x=\\\\lambda(u,H) \\\\cos (\\\\phi ) y=\\\\lambda(u,H)\\\\sin (\\\\phi ) z=\\\\frac{H u}{2} where \\\\lambda(u,H)=\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sqrt{(1-u)\\\\left[8-H^2(1-u)\\\\right]} . Each frame in the animation corresponds to a parametric plot of the deformed grid at a fixed value of the shell height H (ranging from 0 to 2). Physically, \\\\lambda is the stretch (deformed length divided by initial length) of infinitesimal line d\\\\phi line segments. This mapping can be converted to one that keeps the south pole fixed by instead using z=\\\\frac{H (1-u)}{2}. Regardless of the values of (u,\\\\phi,H), the Jacobian of this mapping is everywhere equal to 1, showing that it is indeed an equal area mapping throughout the animation. This generalized mapping includes the Lambert projection as a special case when H=0. Application: this mapping can assist in explaining the meaning of a Lambert projection by showing it to \\"peel open\\" the sphere at a pole, morphing it to a disk without changing area enclosed by grid cells.

He designed the United States' first modern battleships, and supervised the construction of its first modern submarines, all before his 40th birthday. He was briefly the leader of Tammany Hall. He started an ill-fated effort to run seven major American shipyards under common ownership as the United States Shipbuilding Company, and he was the chair of the New York City commission building the Williamsburg Bridge. Birth and naval education Nixon was born on the eve of the American Civil War, in Leesburg, Virginia, to Colonel Joel Lewis Nixon and Mary Jane Turner. Leesburg, only three miles into the Confederacy, changed hands several times over the course of the War. His brother George H.

USS Massachusetts (BB-2) (painting by Antonio Jacobsen) Soon after the contracts for the battleships were awarded, he resigned from the Navy to work as Superintendent of Construction for William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, the shipyard that won the lead contract. Nixon married Sally Lewis Wood of Washington, D.C. in 1891. She died June 15, 1937.Obituary, \\"Mrs. Lewis Nixon; Wife of Former Shipbuilder Who Designed Three Battleships,\\" New York Times, 1937-06-16, at p. 24 Mrs. Nixon was a descendant of General Andrew Lewis of Colonial Virginia. Their son was Stanhope Wood Nixon. Adolfo M√ºller-Ury also painted him full- length in Scottish costume in 1902-1903. Nixon started his own business in January 1895 by leasing the Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He started this business with another former William Cramp & Sons shipbuilder and naval architect, Arthur Leopold Busch, who came from Great Britain to Philadelphia in 1892, and was Nixon's superintendent-in-charge at Crescent during this time. Under Nixon (and Busch) this yard built many vessels, including torpedo boats and ], cruiser , monitor and gunboat . Beginning in December 1896, the Crescent Shipyard, under Nixon's oversight, built the United States' first submarines. The was one of the creations of that shipyard and is a very significant achievement in naval technology. The submarine's success led to an order for more submarines of the \\"Holland Type\\" by the Navy. Those subs, known as the s, were built at the Crescent Shipyard and the Union Iron Works, a shipbuilding firm located near Mare Island Naval Shipyard, 20 miles north of San Francisco. These submarines became America's first fleet of underwater fighting vessels, and were operated by the United States Navy on both coasts. These submarines also gave birth to a new company, founded by John Philip Holland on February 7, 1899. His company was then known as the Holland Torpedo Boat Company and (after 1904) the Electric Boat Company. Lewis Nixon at Crescent Shipyard Nixon was also the founder of the International Smokeless Powder and Dynamite Company of Parlin, New Jersey, and the Standard Motor Construction Company of Jersey City, New Jersey.

Description and history  Gumbo is in the form of a Saint Bernard dog and wears the number 00. It was the Louisiana Restaurant Association's gift to the Saints. From the New Orleans Saints' website: :\\"It was a natural evolution of this idea that the dog be a Saint Bernard, and the name, Gumbo (a conglomeration of food and an iconic New Orleanian dish), reflects the Restaurant Association as well as a famous traditional Cajun meal loved by young and old, rich and poor (a mix like all people who love and support the Saints).\\" Even though Gumbo went into a brief retirement, he was brought back by popular demand, replacing a short lived Phillie Phanatic-like jester mascot known as Mambo For years, Gumbo was, in fact, a real Saint Bernard dog that roamed the sidelines in Saints' apparel for dogs. The reason for choosing this breed of dog is the fact that Orleans Parish (where the City of New Orleans lies) shares a border with St. Bernard Parish to the east. The present mascot consists of a person wearing a Saint Bernard dog head and a football uniform. He is usually seen on the sidelines during games near the goalpost and sometimes celebrates touchdowns with Saints players.Video: Reggie Bush runs over Gumbo the Dog after the Saints win References External links *Gumbo ‚Äî New Orleans Saints website Category:National Football League mascots Category:New Orleans Saints Category:Dog mascots ","title":"Gumbo (mascot)"},{"id":"3663413","text":"The Queen's Foundation, for Ecumenical Theological Education (called the Queen's Foundation, Birmingham; ), is an ecumenical theological college which, with the West Midlands Ministerial Training Course, forms the Centre for Ministerial Formation of the Queen's Foundation for Ecumenical Theological Education.

Representative Henry Waxman of California and Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah sponsored the act. Background Although the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act made it possible for generic companies to get regulatory approval for drugs by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), in the early 1980s it became clear that very few generics were coming to market. Congress studied the issue and realized that under patent and regulatory law, it was easy for innovator companies to make it difficult for generic companies to successfully file ANDAs and that the regulatory pathway to get ANDAs approved was irregular and uncertain. In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act was negotiated and enacted. Provisions Hatch-Waxman amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(j) of the Act, codified as 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 355(j), outlines the process for pharmaceutical manufacturers to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for approval of a generic drug by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Act gives drug innovators some protection while facilitating and providing incentives for companies to file ANDAs. Drug innovators were given protections in two ways. First, a new kind of market exclusivity was introduced, by means of a new five-year period of data exclusivity awarded when the FDA approves marketing of a drug that is a new chemical entity; during that period the FDA cannot approve a generic version of the drug. This provides market exclusivity for the drug innovator outside of any patent rights. Second, the Act allows the life of patents covering a drug to be extended by a portion of the time the drug is under regulatory review by the FDA, ensuring that regulatory review will not unduly consume patent life. The Act also requires the drug innovator to give the FDA the numbers of patents it believes cover its drug; the FDA does not evaluate whether the patents cover the drug, but publicly lists them in the Orange Book, and these are the patents the life of which is extended if there are regulatory delays. The Act facilitates the filing of ANDAs by generic companies, by preventing the FDA from asking a generic company to provide anything other than information on how it is going to manufacture the drug, quality assurance, and a study showing that the drug acts the same in a human as the innovator drug; this is called bioequivalence. This part of the Act is one of few pieces of legislation that restricts the powers and reach of a federal agency. The Act also gives generic companies safe harbor from patent infringement lawsuits during the time when the generic company is preparing its ANDA; during that time the generic company needs to learn how to manufacture the drug, manufacture a test batch, and run bioequivalence studies, all activities for which it could be sued for infringement. This protection is called the research exemption. When a company is ready to file its ANDA, the Act requires it to declare how its activities when it begins to market the drug will relate to patents listed in the Orange Book; there are four options, or \\"certifications\\": it can state that there never were patents listed, that listed patents have expired, that it will not market the drug until the all the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired, or that it believes the patents in the Orange Book are not relevant or are invalid. These four alternatives are called the Paragraph I, II, III, and IV certifications (named after Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV)). The Act incentivizes companies to file paragraph IV certifications by rewarding the first company to file an ANDA with such a certification with 180 days of administrative exclusivity if their ANDA is approved; during that period the FDA cannot approve another generic. Because the Act also makes clear that filing an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification is an act of patent infringement, the law actually promotes litigation between private parties; the innovator is prompted to commence patent enforcement litigation against the generic infringer, and the generic company is incentivized to file a countersuit to have the patents listed in the Orange Book declared invalid. Consequences Passage of the law prompted a gold rush into the generic industry and a crush of applications, which the FDA was not prepared to handle. A series of scandals soon arose that shook public confidence in generic drugs; there were several instances in which companies obtained bioequivalence data fraudulently, by using the branded drug in their tests instead of their own product, and a congressional investigation found corruption at the FDA, where employees were accepting bribes to approve some generic companies' applications and delaying or denying others. With time the law became successful in promoting the introduction of generics; in 1983 only 35% of top-selling branded drugs with expired patents had generic competition, and only 13% of prescriptions were for generics but in 2012, 84% of prescriptions in the US were filled with generic drugs. There have been issues with litigation incentivized by the Act. Once the parties are in litigation, they can choose to fight the litigation to the end, or they may choose to settle the litigation. Some of these settlements have been found to be invalid reverse payment patent settlement agreements and have been struck down in court. The FDA has been slow to adopt regulations for the introduction of generic versions of biopharmaceutical drugs (known as \\"biosimilars\\") because the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals is so much more complicated than small molecule drugs. Innovator companies have emphasized those complications while generic companies, insurance companies, and consumers have advocated for the FDA to finalize their process.

It is the first accredited Muslim undergraduate college in the United States and was founded in 2008 by Hamza Yusuf, Zaid Shakir and Hatem Bazian. Prior to becoming a college, Zaytuna was an institute, founded in 1996 by Hamza Yusuf and Hesham Alalusi. Zaytuna College seeks to incorporate the importance of the liberal arts and humanities into a traditional Islamic education curriculum. In the academic year 2014-2015, Zaytuna College had an undergraduate student body of about fifty students, most of whom live on campus. Zaytuna College offers one major, in Islamic Law and Theology, with courses ranging from Arabic grammar and Islamic jurisprudence, to American history and literature. Zaytuna College also conducts an intensive Arabic language summer course. Zaytuna College was conceived from the imperative to establish centers of Islamic learning for the Muslim-American community in the West which are equipped to interpret Islamic scriptures authoritatively and educate Western students in light of the cultural context in which they live. Zaytuna College has been recognized as an institution that has the ability to bridge the divide between America and the Muslim world. The faculty of Zaytuna College consists of scholars of Arabic, Islamic Studies and Liberal Arts. The institution derives its name from the Arabic word Zaytuna, which means olive tree. Biblical and Qur'anic scholars deem the olive a source of great benefit and worth. History In 1996, Zaytuna Institute was founded by Hamza Yusuf and Hesham Alalusi and incorporated in California as a non-profit, educational institute. The Institute's mandate was to teach courses on Arabic and Islamic Studies as well as to engage in community service and outreach. Zaytuna Institute acquired a campus in the city of Hayward, CA and in 2001, Zaid Shakir and other instructors conducted a four-year pilot seminary project from which five students graduated. With the learned experience of the pilot program, Zaytuna Institute went on to establish Zaytuna College. Zaytuna Institute conducted a summer Arabic intensive program in 2008 and soon after officially changed its name from Zaytuna Institute to Zaytuna College in 2009. Undergraduate classes started in 2010. Moving to Berkeley from Hayward, CA was seen as an opportunity to expand the resources available to Zaytuna College and to collaborate with established institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley and the Graduate Theological Union. Campus Zaytuna College was situated in a facility rented from the American Baptist Seminary of the West (ABSW) in Berkeley, CA. In July 2012, Zaytuna purchased new facility which is situated in Berkeley's ‚ÄúHoly Hill‚Äù. Holy Hill consists of multiple theological schools of multiple Christian denominations. In 2018, they purchased a campus in the hilltops of Berkeley Hills which consists of 10 acres, a garden, an archery field, a dormitory, and several buildings for classes, teacher's offices, and student life events. Academics The college is accredited to offer only a single degree, a bachelor's degree in Islamic law and theology. All students are required to learn Arabic, to enable them to study Islamic texts in the original language. Zaytuna College takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of humanities and social sciences. The College's liberal arts program consists of subjects like American history, ethics, philosophy, literature and logic. As a liberal arts college, Zaytuna believes in the need to equip its students with the basic tools for the acquisition of knowledge, along with a broad understanding of American and Islamic culture and history. It is with this grounding in the Islamic scholarly tradition and understanding of American society and history which will allow Zaytuna College students to establish Islam as a healthy feature of American society. Zaytuna College offers courses on Islamic History, English Composition, Islamic Theology, Islamic Law, and Arabic. It also offers a Summer Arabic Intensive program. Students of Arabic at Zaytuna College are required to have completed the Arabic summer intensive, or its equivalent at another institution, prior to starting at Zaytuna College. The Arabic summer intensive enrollment has continued to grow and, by 2012, had doubled from its inaugural year in 2008. =Educational philosophy= The college's motto is \\"Where Islam Meets America\\". Zaytuna College envisions creating a lasting institution of higher learning and aims to educate and prepare morally committed professional, intellectual, and spiritual leaders, who are grounded in the Islamic scholarly tradition and conversant with the cultural currents and critical ideas shaping modern society. Zaytuna College sees itself following in a tradition of religious communities who established colleges for their communities such as Catholics and Jews. In this respect, Zaytuna College has been compared to other private religious liberal arts schools such as Georgetown, Brandeis, Notre Dame and others. =Accreditation= In 2015, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges granted Zaytuna Institute accreditation to award a single degree, \\"the Bachelor of Arts in Islamic Law and Theology,\\" making Zaytuna Institute the first accredited Muslim campus in the United States. Student body Zaytuna College's student body includes only 50 students. About half are from California. The rest are from states including Ohio, Colorado, New York, Michigan, as well as other states. According to the Washington Post, the students are both American and foreign born, and are of \\"Pakistani, Arabic, Turkish, African-American and Latino backgrounds\\". The first Zaytuna College class consisted of eight women and seven men. Some Zaytuna College students have previously received undergraduate degrees from Ivy League universities such as Columbia; others have begun their undergraduate studies at Zaytuna College without prior undergraduate experience. Some Zaytuna College students have turned down offers to attend notable universities such as the University of Chicago and others to attend Zaytuna College because of the emphasis on character development embedded in the culture of Zaytuna College. The student body consists of many converts to Islam, as well as second generation Muslims and others who have backgrounds that extend to Muslim majority countries. There are no admission restrictions based on religious affiliation or sect. Zaytuna College's yearly tuition is $12,177.00. The College offers housing on campus with an estimated additional annual cost of $6,873.75.

A member of Passions Russell family, Simone is introduced as the youngest daughter of Eve Russell and T. C. Russell, and the younger sister of Whitney Russell. Her early appearances center on her love triangle with Chad Harris-Crane and her sister Whitney; the character later gains more prominence on the show through her experience coming out as a lesbian to her family, and her relationship with Rae Thomas. The network defended the show's treatment of Simone's sexuality as a serious commentary on the topic. Simone was created as a part of the show's effort to represent a complete African-American family and fully realized African-American characters on television. Conceived by the soap's founder and head writer James E. Reilly, the role was portrayed by three actresses over the course of the show: Lena Cardwell (1999‚Äì2001), Chrystee Pharris (2001‚Äì2004), and Cathy Jen√©en Doe (2004‚Äì2007). The exact reasons behind Cardwell's departure remain unknown; Pharris chose to leave to pursue other acting opportunities. Doe was the third and final actress to play Simone before the character was written off the show shortly before its transition to DirecTV. Simone's storyline made daytime television history when Passions became the first soap opera to show two women having sex. The character was also daytime television's first African-American lesbian. At the 17th GLAAD Media Awards, the show won Outstanding Daily Drama, and Doe accepted the award on the show's behalf. The show's representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) topics, and Doe's performance as Simone, received a mixed response from critics; she was the principal actress during the storylines focusing on the character's sexuality. Development = Casting and creation = Sheraton Kalouria, senior vice president of NBC's daytime programming, described the show's color-blind casting as part of an effort to build a diverse pool of characters that best reflected the various ethnic and racial groups living in the United States. Kalouria believed the show stood apart from other soap operas by including the African-American Russell family and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgerald family. Over the course of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), Chrystee Pharris (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and Cathy Jen√©en Doe (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). After watching Cardwell's audition for the role, producers Reilly and Lisa de Cazotte considered Cardwell the ideal choice for Simone. NBC fired Cardwell in the winter of 2001, in a move described as \\"abrupt\\" in an article from Soapcentral. Cast members expressed disappointment at Cardwell's departure and the character's re-casting. Tracey Ross, who portrays Eve Russell, described Cardwell as being \\"very sincere, completely authentic and without malice\\" in her performance. Rodney Van Johnson, who plays T. C. Russell, viewed himself as \\"a father figure to her\\" and felt that their close relationship helped make the Russell family more authentic and relatable to viewers. After leaving the show, Cardwell said she received a great deal of fan mail and that the experience \\"made [her] feel loved and appreciated.\\" Pharris assumed the role in 2001, but later decided to not renew her contract in order to pursue other projects. During an interview with The Christian Post, she said that her time on Passions helped her to realize that her occupation as an actress could be used as a platform to advocate for Christianity. Doe was hired for the third and final re-casting after moving to Los Angeles from New York, where she was primarily offered the role of \\"a runaway teenager, a prostitute, a drug dealer\\". Initially hesitant to assume a character already established by other actors, she became friendly with Pharris, who answered all of her questions about the character. = Characterization = Simone was initially characterized by the show's official website through her \\"major crush on street-kid Chad Harris since he came to town\\". Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide described Simone's early behavior as \\"bitchy to her older sister, who was nothing but kind to her\\", while Variety's Josef referred to the character as a \\"daredevil teen.\\" When assuming the role in 2001, Pharris said that her preparation consisted of consulting with her friends about Simone, Whitney, and Chad, and incorporating her own life experiences into her interpretation of the character. She commented that working closely with the producers allowed her to draw on her family background for her performance. While discussing the connection to her family, she stated that she used her father's temper as inspiration for playing Simone. Simone was initially portrayed as one of the series' supporting characters, but gained more prominence during a storyline in which she comes out as a lesbian. Kalouria defended the show's treatment of the character's sexuality as a serious commentary on the topic. During an interview about the storyline, he highlighted \\"sexual identity isn't a passing fancy\\" and \\"this is where [Simone] is...I can assure you we're not going to make light of this particular topic.\\" During the story arc involving her girlfriend Rae Thomas, Simone was noted for her naivety when approaching relationships and sex. Simone's sexuality is initially regarded as \\"a badge of shame\\" by the series' characters. Storylines Introduced in the series premiere on July 5, 1999, Simone Russell is the youngest daughter of T. C. and Eve Russell, and the younger sister of Whitney Russell. The family lives in the fictional town of Harmony. Simone's early storylines concentrate on her reluctant participation in her friend Kay Bennett's schemes to separate Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald from Charity Standish and her attraction to Chad-Harris Crane. Chad and Whitney hide their relationship from Simone to the point where Chad pretends to be Simone's boyfriend to keep her happy. After catching Chad and Whitney having sex, she ends the relationship with him and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with her sister. Disconnected from her sister, Simone becomes close friends with Kay's younger sister Jessica Bennett and Miguel's younger sister Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, and turns to them for support. Simone acts primarily in a supporting role for these two characters' storylines, for instance advising Jessica to divorce her abusive husband Spike Lester and seek professional help for her drug addiction. She briefly dates John Hastings, the son of David Hastings. At the time, John was mistakenly believed to be Grace Standish's son and the half-brother of Kay and Jessica. Simone's relationship with John ends in 2004 when he moves to Italy with David and Grace. In mid-2005, Simone comes out as a lesbian by revealing to her family her relationship with Rae Thomas. The family reacts negatively to her sexual orientation. T. C. beats her and says he is ashamed to be her father. Eve panics and is concerned that her daughter's reputation will suffer if the rest of Harmony learns of her sexuality. Simone's great-aunt, Irma Johnson, describes homosexuality as a sin and calls her \\"vile\\" and \\"disgusting\\". Simone turns to her mother for emotional support after Rae rejects her declarations of love by revealing that she has no interest in a committed relationship. In December 2005, Eve, Julian, Liz, and T. C. find a video from Alistair Crane in which he claims to have hired Rae to seduce Simone and \\"turn\\" her into a lesbian. Rae later explains that the money is intended to start a lesbian club and that she was never hired to \\"turn\\" Simone gay. As she reconciles with Rae, Simone reconnects with her family. Her father, who recently suffered from a stroke following a car accident, apologizes for his homophobic behavior toward her. Her mother also becomes more supportive of her relationship. Rae finds out Vincent Clarkson was framing Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald for his girlfriend Fancy Crane's rape. On February 12, 2007, Vincent stabs Rae to death before she can reveal his identity to Luis. Simone attempts to cope with Rae's death by helping Jessica through her pregnancy. She invites Jessica to live in Rae's old apartment so they can protect the baby from Spike. Eve, who was previously being blackmailed by Vincent, tells Simone the truth about Rae's murder. Simone leaves Harmony with her sister Whitney to start a new life in New Orleans. She does not appear during the show's run on DirecTV or in the series finale. In July 2008, Simone sends a letter to Kay congratulating her on her wedding to Miguel and includes a pair of earrings as the \\"something new\\".  Reception and impact  Simone's storyline about coming out as a lesbian received mixed feedback. She was identified as \\"a character who broke down some barriers for the depiction of lesbians on daytime TV and earned the show awards and accolades from civil rights groups\\" by a writer from Soaps.com. The Atlantics Aaron Foley saw the show's inclusion of a black, lesbian character as a sign of \\"America bec[oming] more comfortable with seeing blacks on screen\\" and viewers \\"bec[oming] more comfortable with risky, sometimes hilarious storylines\\". Damon Romine, media entertainment director of GLAAD (2005‚Äì2009), emphasized the show's ability to normalize lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) topics for a wider audience, and opined that the introduction of gay characters made soap operas worth watching. Simone's homosexuality was described as \\"the most real and moving story on the show\\" by Soapcentrals Brandi Pine, who found T. C.'s negative reaction to be a realistic portrayal of a parent's difficult in accepting his or her child's sexual orientation. Sarah Warn, former editor of entertainment website AfterEllen.com, considered the storyline an improvement over a similar one used in All My Children. Following the character's departure in 2007, Soaps.com identified Simone as a \\"charming and strong willed\\" character who would be remembered for \\"br[eaking] down some barriers for the depiction of lesbians on daytime TV\\". Several television critics had a more negative response to Simone's storyline as a lesbian and to Doe's performance. Warn criticized Simone's relationship with Rae as poorly developed, believing her to be limited to \\"a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl\\", and argued that viewers never had the opportunity to \\"see this woman through her eyes\\" since the character's sexuality and past relationships with men, and her possible bisexuality, were never addressed on screen. Warn also derided the lack of chemistry between Doe and Jossara Jinaro, who plays Rae. Herndon L. Davis of Windy City Times felt the representation of Simone as daytime's first African-American lesbian was overshadowed by the show's poor portrayal of Vincent Clarkson. Davis discussed Simone's story arc in his wider criticism of race in daytime television. Rae's death following the reveal of Chad's affair with Vincent was heavily criticized by Mike Perigard of the Boston Herald, who believed that her removal was only written to maintain a low quota of gay characters on the show. Simone was the first African-American lesbian to be featured on daytime television. Passions also made history by becoming the first daytime television series to show two women having sex. The soap opera won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards, with Doe accepting the award on the show's behalf. Doe was also listed as a pre-nominee for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the 34th Daytime Emmy Awards alongside co-star Emily Harper, but was not chosen as one of the final nominees.

It was developed to build a railroad across the state of Iowa and began operations in 1856. It was acquired by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1872, and kept serving as its subsidiary.

It commenced operations on January 1, 1856 with only a few miles of track. In 1857 it connected to Ottumwa, followed by Murray in 1868. It finally reached the Missouri River in November 1859. It used wood- burning locomotives and wooden passenger cars. After the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) finished a bridge crossing the Mississippi River at Burlington, it connected to the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad. By 1868 the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad operated 13 locomotives and 429 cars, mostly freight, with net earnings of $299,850 in 1867. After the interest on loans, this meant a total net profit of $6,749. A sub-branch of the railroad was founded in Nebraska in 1869, with rails first entering the state in 1870 via Plattsmouth. That summer, the railroad reached Lincoln, the recently designated state capital. It later continued to lay rails westward and eventually joining with the Union Pacific Railroad on September 3, 1872 at Kearney; this had the effect of linking traffic from southern Nebraska to the rest of the continent.

She was Lieutenant Governor of New York from 1975 to 1978. She was the first woman to hold the office, and only the second woman in New York history to be nominated by a major party in a statewide election. Early life She was born on March 26, 1932, in Schenectady, New York, the daughter of Ambrose M. Krupczak and Mamie (Wytrwal) Krupczak. She grew up in Amsterdam, Montgomery County, New York, where her parents ran a pharmacy. Her father was a Democratic member of the Board of Supervisors of Montgomery County, representing the City of Amsterdam's Fourth Ward. She is of Polish ancestry. She attended the University of Rochester and received a master's degree in public communications from Boston University in 1953. She worked in the New York State Department of Commerce as a public information officer, and also for the gubernatorial campaign of W. Averell Harriman. After his victory, she joined the Governor's staff and remained through his term. When he lost his bid for reelection, she went to work for a year with Representative Samuel S. Stratton. In 1959 she decided to obtain a J.D. degree and entered the University of Chicago Law School. After graduation, she practiced law only briefly, taking a job with the vice president of Mobil, Howard J. Samuels, before returning to Albany to be an assistant counsel for the state Senate staff. In 1970, Krupsak married Edwin Margolis, a law professor at Hunter College and counsel to Democratic members of the Assembly. Political career Krupsak was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1969 to 1973, sitting in the 178th and 179th New York State Legislatures. Her district included Montgomery County and part of Schenectady. She was a member of the New York State Senate from 1973 to 1975. In May 1974, Krupsak announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of New York. She was initially rebuffed by the state Democratic committee which in June endorsed a then-novice politician, Mario Cuomo, for the position. Krupsak campaigned through the primary season and won the strong support of women's rights groups, labor unions, and liberal organizations. In the September primary she handily beat both Cuomo and a second rival, liberal Manhattanite Antonio Olivieri. She was elected Lieutenant Governor in the state election of November 1974. University of Rochester, special collections Contrary to widely reported comments during the campaign, Krupsak was not the first woman nominated by a major New York political party for statewide office. That distinction belongs to Florence Knapp, a Republican nominated for (and elected to) New York Secretary of State in 1924. Krupsak, however, was the first woman nominated for (and elected to) the Lieutenant Governorship. Elected with Governor Hugh Carey, Krupsak became upset with how Carey treated her in office and felt she was not given enough to do. After committing to run for a second term with Carey in 1978, Krupsak decided to withdraw from the ticket and instead challenge Carey for the Democratic nomination for governor. She lost the Democratic primary to Carey, and after running unsuccessfully for Congress in 1980,TWO LEAVING HOUSE GENERATE CONTESTS; Miss Krupsak Is Being Challenged in 30th District in the New York Times on August 31, 1980 (subscription required) she retired from politics.

Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection with Tissot's indicatrix of deformation In cartography, the Lambert cylindrical equal-area projection, or Lambert cylindrical projection, is a cylindrical equal-area projection. This projection is undistorted along the equator, which is its standard parallel, but distortion increases rapidly towards the poles. Like any cylindrical projection, it stretches parallels increasingly away from the equator. The poles accrue infinite distortion, becoming lines instead of points. History How the Earth is projected onto a cylinder The projection was invented by the Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert and described in his 1772 treatise, Beitr√§ge zum Gebrauche der Mathematik und deren Anwendung, part III, section 6: Anmerkungen und Zus√§tze zur Entwerfung der Land- und Himmelscharten, translated as, Notes and Comments on the Composition of Terrestrial and Celestial Maps. Lambert's projection is the basis for the cylindrical equal-area projection family. Lambert chose the equator as the parallel of no distortion. By multiplying the projection's height by some factor and dividing the width by the same factor, the regions of no distortion can be moved to any desired pair of parallels north and south of the equator. These variations, particularly the Gall‚ÄìPeters projection, are more commonly encountered in maps than Lambert‚Äôs original projection due to their lower distortion overall.

The college stood in the open evangelical tradition and stated that its mission is \\"to inspire creative Christian learning marked by evangelical conviction, theological excellence and Spirit-filled life, that all who train with us might be equipped for mission in a world of change\\".Vision and Values - St John's School of Mission, https://stjohns- nottm.ac.uk/about-stjohns. Retrieved April 27, 2017.St John's, Nottingham prospectus. St John's trained students for ministries in the Church of England and other denominations, independent students from a range of Christian contexts, and students for children's and youth ministries through its Midlands centre for the Institute for Children, Youth and Mission (MCYM). It offered a diversity of full-time, part-time, blended and distance learning courses, including specialist modules in pastoral care and counselling and church administration. Academic awards were validated by Durham University and Gloucester University, and it also offered its own flexible, self-accredited Certificate in Christian Studies, which could be taken at variable speeds on a module-by-module basis.Study St John's School of Mission History The college was established as the London College of Divinity in 1863. It was founded by the Reverend Alfred Peache and his sister, Kezia, who had inherited their businessman father's fortune in 1857. The college was established to provide an evangelical theological education to ordinands who could not go to university. The Reverend Thomas Boultbee was appointed as the first principal and a college council and governing body was formed, with Lord Shaftesbury chosen to be its president. The first premises were near Kilburn High Road Station and the first student was Francis Browne, a lieutenant in the Merchant Navy, was welcomed on 23 November 1863. These early premises had been called St John's Hall because they had previously been occupied by the St John's Foundation School for the Sons of Poor Clergy, which itself had started life in St John's Wood before moving to Kilburn. The 'St John's' name stuck as an informal title for the college - not least because Boultbee was a graduate of St John's College, Cambridge, and intended that the new institution he now led should attain academic standards comparable to those of his alma mater. Although the St John associated with St John's Wood is John the Baptist, Boultbee was clear that the St John of his fledgling 'St John's College' was John the Evangelist, author of the Fourth Gospel. In 1866 the college moved to Highbury, which was its home for nearly 80 years. As the Second World War approached, the college was flourishing under the leadership of T. W. Gilbert. In May 1942, however, faculty, staff and students were evacuated to Wadhurst School in Sussex as the Highbury buildings had been damaged by air-raids and were requisitioned by the National Fire Service. Following the sudden death of Gilbert, Donald Coggan became principal in 1944. During this time, a new site in Northwood, London, was bought for the college to replace the war-ruined buildings which now contained just three students. For the 10 years that Coggan was principal, the college was based in one of the houses at Harrow School, and then at Ford Manor in Lingfield, Surrey. It was under Coggan's successor, Prebendary Hugh Jordan, that discussion of a move away from London began. Jordan believed that the college's future lay outside of the capital city and nearer to a university, and he learnt that a site was available in Nottingham, whose university's theological department was growing in reputation. In 1970, Michael Green, who succeeded Jordan as principal, oversaw the move from London to the college's current location in Bramcote, Nottingham. This move meant that the formal name 'London College of Divinity' was not longer applicable, and 'St John's' became the legal title of the institution. From 1970 St John's developed and diversified its ministry under the successive leadership of Green, Robin Nixon, Colin Buchanan, Anthony Thiselton, John Goldingay, Christina Baxter, David Hilborn and Sally Nash. It was a pioneer of distance learning programmes in theology, and made new theological thinking and research accessible to a wide audience through its A5-sized Grove Booklet series (now published through an independent company and also available online).https://grovebooks.co.uk In the 1990s it ran the earliest forms of what would become known as context-based training in the Church of England, and latterly provided part-time pathways alongside more traditional forms of full-time residential training. In 2014 the college announced that it would be placing greater emphasis on contextual and part- time routes for licensed ministry and independent students, while maintaining and developing its ongoing provision of children's and youth ministry education, blended learning and distance learning. In February 2017 it gained planning permission for the redevelopment of its site and the modernisation of its main academic facilities. In late 2019 the college announced that delivery of its youth ministry programmes would be moving to a new location in central Leicester, and that its Distance Learning provision would be taken forward in collaboration with Queen's College, Birmingham. These changes coincided with the inauguration of a new hub of the Anglican-based St Mellitus College in central Nottingham. In December 2019, the college closed due to financial constraints that impacted upon its long term viability.St John‚Äôs College to close after 156 years Notable staff =List of principals= *Thomas Pownall Boultbee (1863 to 1884); inaugural principal *Charles Waller (1884 to 1899) *Albert Greenup (1899 to 1925) *Thomas Gilbert (1926 to 1942) *Donald Coggan (1944 to 1956); later Archbishop of Canterbury *Hugh Jordan (1956-1969) *Michael Green (1969 to 1975) *Robin Ernest Nixon (1975 to 1978); died in office *Colin Buchanan (1979 to 1985) *Anthony Thiselton (1986 to 1988) *John Goldingay (1988 to 1997) *Christina Baxter (1997 to 2012); the first lay head of college *David Hilborn (2012 to 2018); formerly Head of Theology at the Evangelical Alliance UK and Assistant Dean of St Mellitus College *Sally Nash (Team Leader 2018-19) =Others= *George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury (1991‚Äì2002) *Graham Dow, Bishop of Carlisle (2000‚Äì2009) *John Witcombe, Dean of Coventry Cathedral (2013-) Notable alumni *Kate Bottley, Church of England priest and broadcaster *Pete Broadbent, Bishop of Willesden *Richard Burridge, Dean of King's College London *Christopher Cocksworth, Bishop of Coventry (2008‚Äìpresent) *Graham Dow, Bishop of Carlisle *Viv Faull, Bishop- designate of Bristol, Dean of York, Provost/Dean of Leicester *Susan Gillingham, first British woman to be awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree by Oxford University *David Ison, Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, London *Bob Jackson, Church growth expert *David James, Bishop of Bradford (2002-2010) *Andrew John, Bishop of Bangor (2009‚Äìpresent) *J.John, international evangelist and author based in the United Kingdom *George Lings, Church planting expert *Janani Luwum, Archbishop of Uganda (1974‚Äì1977) and martyr *Charlie Masters, Moderator Bishop of the Anglican Network in Canada (ANiC) *Harold Miller, Bishop of Down and Dromore *Ivan Neill, Chaplain General of the British Army and Provost of Sheffield *Henry Luke Orombi, Archbishop of the (Anglican) Church of Uganda *June Osborne, Dean of Salisbury *Moses Nathanael Christopher Omobiala Scott, Archbishop of West Africa *Tom Smail, early leader in the British Charismatic Movement, theologian and teacher *Anthony Thiselton, Professor of Christian Theology at University of Nottingham, Canon Theologian at Leicester and Southwell & Nottingham *Robert Warren, National Officer in Evangelism (1994-2003), speaker, writer and teacher References External links  *St John's School of Mission official website Category:Anglican seminaries and theological colleges Category:Educational institutions established in 1863 Category:1863 establishments in England Category:2019 disestablishments in England Category:Bible colleges, seminaries and theological colleges in England Category:Anglican buildings and structures in the United Kingdom Category:Former theological colleges in England ","title":"St John's College, Nottingham"},{"id":"3663449","text":"Norbert Theodore \\"Nobby\\" Tiemann (July 18, 1924 ‚Äì June 19, 2012) was an American Republican politician from Wausa, Nebraska, and was the 32nd Governor of Nebraska, serving from 1967 to 1971.Norbert Tiemann page at National Governors Association Biography Tiemann was born in Minden, Nebraska.

Founded in 1869, it is the second-oldest collegiate newspaper in the United States. The Daily Targum is student written and managed, and boasts a circulation of 5,000 in 2017. In its current form, it exists as a bi-fold tabloid-style paper featuring international, national, local, and university news, as well as editorials, columns, comics, classifieds, sports, and other amusements. In 1980, the paper achieved independence from the University, establishing a non-profit organization, the Targum Publishing Company, which now oversees all areas of the paper. The Daily Targum is published Monday through Friday while classes are in session, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 2006, publishing of The Newark Targum began, serving the Rutgers‚ÄìNewark campus. CNBC personality Rebecca Quick served as the newspaper's editor-in-chief for a period, before joining The Wall Street Journal. AVN personality David Aaron Clark served as the newspaper's editor- in-chief for a period. Targum timeline 1866: Then Rutgers President William H. Campbell lectures to Rutgers men on the original text of the Old Testament, including Aramaic language paraphrases of the Hebrew Scriptures, called Targums. The word \\"Targum\\" means interpretation in Aramaic and is used as a slang word when referring to crib sheets, among various Aramaic terms that become part of the campus vernacular. This is the inspiration for the name of the forthcoming periodical. 1867: The Targum first appears as a four- page publication, the forerunner of the Scarlet Letter Yearbook. 1869: On Jan. 29 the Targum begins publishing as a monthly newspaper and literary magazine. It includes campus news, poetry, humor and essays on literature, science, philosophy, religion and travel. This same year Rutgers hosts the first intercollegiate football game with Princeton University, which Rutgers wins (and the Targum dutifully reports), 6‚Äì4. 1880: The Targum begins printing once every three weeks. 1891: The Targum becomes a weekly publication. 1919: The format changes from an 8\\" by 11\\" format to an 11\\" by 17\\" tabloid size. 1927: The first annual spoof issue of the Targum, the Mugrat (Targum spelled backwards) is printed. The issue reports that a Rutgers professor has been held in the county jail, charged with cruelty to animals. 1954: The Targum is printed four times a week. 1956: The newspaper becomes a daily publication, printing five days a week. 1969: Letterpress printing off-campus abandoned in favor of photo-offset print shop run by students on campus. 1970: Targum staff threatens strike if editors appoint new editorial board without staff input. Staff election of editors established through Targum caucus. Tony Mauro elected editor-in-chief over prior editors' choice. 1978: The Targum staff strikes after demands for honoraria are not met. 1980: The Targum Publishing Company files its papers of incorporation on July 1, 1980, following a year of negotiations with the University and an arduously fought battle to pass the student vote for funding. Students now fund the Targum directly through a refundable fee on their term bills. 1983: Typewriters are discarded as the first computers enter the Targum's newsroom. 1996: The Targum goes online. 1998: In January of this year, the Targum begins using full color on the front and back pages on a daily basis. 2002: The productions staff leaves film behind as the newspaper begins fully electronic publication. 2004: The \\"Happy Hour\\" comic strip begins appearing in the paper on November 30, originally created by Jim Kohl. 2006: The first issue of The Newark Targum is launched on February 15, 2006. 2008: The first video is posted on the Daily Targum website. Source: Celebrating 25 Years of Independence, by Theresa Poulson. pgs. 6‚Äì7. May 2005. 2009: Regular videos and audio slideshows begin to be posted on the Targum website. 2011: The Daily Targum increases circulation to 18,000 papers Monday through Thursday, and 15,500 on Friday. The Targum website also switches to Town News CMS web hosting, launches a Tumblr account (in addition to its Facebook and Twitter pages), and gets set to launch a mobile app for iPhones and Androids. 2013: The Daily Targum began livestreaming, beginning with the March 12 Strategic Planning Town Hall with University President Robert L. Barchi ‚Äî the first on the New Brunswick campus. 2019: The Daily Targum was unsuccessful in its triennial referendum, failing to pass the vote across all eight voting units polled. The vote amassed less than 30% of the total eligible undergraduate student voting population. The Targum saw a reduction in funding of about 75% through student fees. The Targum responded by cutting its Friday print publication, decreasing its circulation to 5,000, and taking on a digital-first approach. Referendum In order to secure student funding for the Daily Targum, the newspaper is required to hold a referendum every three years. Since 1980, the Daily Targum has sought to receive \\"yes\\" votes from 25% of the students at each University division in order to receive funding from all the students in that division. On May 13, 2019, the Daily Targum announced it had failed to receive the necessary votes for the referendum to pass and for the paper to continue to receive funding through student fees.https://www.nj.com/education/2019/05/rutgers-student-newspaper-gutted-of- funding-leaving-future-up-in-the-air.html See also * Rutgers University * Rutgers University student organizations * Rutgers Centurion References External links *The Daily Targum (Official Site) *The Newark Targum *\\"Birth of an alumni association and an independent Targum\\" Jdlasica.com Category:Rutgers University Category:Publications established in 1869 Category:Student newspapers published in New Jersey Category:1869 establishments in New Jersey Category:Newspapers published in New Jersey ","title":"The Daily Targum"},{"id":"3663539","text":"Elliott Brothers may refer to: * Elliott Brothers (computer company), an early computer company (1950s‚Äì1960s), U.K. * Elliott Brothers (builders merchant), a builders' merchant, Southampton, U.K. ","title":"Elliott Brothers"},{"id":"3663550","text":"The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia () better known by its acronym SUHAKAM is the national human rights institution (NHRI) of Malaysia. It was established by the Malaysian Parliament under the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999, Act 597,SUHAKAM Act and began its work in April 2000. Its mandate is to promote human rights education, advise on legislation and policy, and conduct investigations. Having been established after the fallout of the Anwar Ibrahim controversy, some lacked confidence in its independence from the government of the then Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Muhammad. However, when Tan Sri Dato' Musa Hitam was named as the first chairman of the (initially, 13-member) commission, these fears were eased, as he was believed to be critical of Mahathir in many ways. The commission's recommendations under Musa, however, were often not implemented by the government. When his two-year term ended, he did not seek reappointment. Musa was replaced with Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman in April 2002. Abu Talib had served as Attorney General under Mahathir, and was also involved in the Anwar Ibrahim controversy. As reported in Malaysiakini, he was widely seen as close to Mahathir, but SUHAKAM under Abu Talib continued to put forth many human rights recommendations. Many of these recommendations have yet to be acted upon by the government. International standing SUHAKAM was accredited as a full \\"A status\\" member of the Asia Pacific Forum (APF), the regional network of NHRIs, and has since been reaccredited by the International Co-ordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC) to which the APF now defers on accreditation. In 2008 SUHAKAM was asked by the accreditation subcommittee of the ICC to explain in writing within a year, evidence to establish its continued conformity with the Paris Principles, failure of which would result in a status downgrade from A to B and would disqualify them from attending sessions hosted by the UN Human Rights Council. The ICC sought to encourage the Government of Malaysia to amend the body's founding laws and make it more independent. However, when SUHAKAM was reviewed by the ICC in November 2009, it was decided to retain its A status pending a further review to be carried out in 2010, with particular attention to the process for selecting members of the commission. SUHAKAM regrets use of Act On 9 May 2008, SUHAKAM stated that it was concerned by the Sedition Act being used to curb freedom of speech. Datuk N. Siva Subramaniam (pmp)said the fundamental freedom enshrined in the Constitution, including the freedom of speech and freedom of peaceful assembly, must be safeguarded and he also made comments on the arrest and charging of the editor of the news portal Malaysia Today, Raja Petra Kamarudin saying \\"SUHAKAM regrets that Raja Petra was charged under the Internal Security Act (Malaysia), as this is an infringement on the freedom of speech which is a fundamental human right. The use of the Act in this case is unjustified as civil remedies could have been sought in a Court of Law\\".http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/5/9/nation/21185364&sec;=nation  Concerning child marriage in Malaysia  Suhakam Chairman Razali Ismail condemns the recurrence of child marriage in Malaysia, calling it \\"a violation of human rights and not a solution to poverty\\" Suhakam is against marriages involving underage children, especially those coming from the poor families. This practice is unfair to the children involved and provided a method for parents to sell their children through marriage. As of 2018, child marriage is still practiced in Malaysia, often as a means of getting out of poverty by turning children into commodities. Razali also called upon the women, family and community development ministry to make social protection programmes for poor children a priority.

He was the son of Roger de Mowbray and nephew of Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances. The family name derives from Montbrai in Manche, Normandy, Mowbray being an Anglicisation of it. Earldom of Northumbria Robert was made Earl of Northumbria after Aubrey de Coucy, the previous earl, decided that he no longer wished to remain in his post. Coucy was made earl in 1080 and, probably that same year, resigned his position and returned to Normandy, losing all of the lands that he held in England. He was not replaced until Robert was appointed in 1086. Robert joined his uncle, Geoffrey, in the failed rebellion of 1088 against William Rufus on behalf of Robert, duke of Normandy, but both were pardoned and Robert remained in his post as Earl of Northumbria. In November 1093, Malcolm III of Scotland invaded Northumbria for the second time since 1091, and attacked Alnwick. Robert de Mowbray raised an army and attacked the Scots taking them by surprise on 13 November (St Brice‚Äôs Day). In the ensuing Battle of Alnwick, Malcolm and his son Edward were slain. Earlier that same year, Geoffrey de Montbray died and Mowbray succeeded to his uncle's large estates, so becoming one of the most powerful barons in the kingdom. Mowbray married in 1095 to Matilda, daughter of Richer de l'Aigle, and niece of Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester.George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, A history of the House of lords and all its members from the earliest times, Vol. IX, eds. H.A. Doubleday; Howard de Walden (London: The St. Catherine Press, Ltd., 1936), pp. 367-9, 706 Rebellion and downfall In 1095 Mowbray took part in a rebellion which had for its object the transference of the crown from the sons of the Conqueror to Stephen of Aumale. It appears that there was a conspiracy that included several barons, but that when the time came for action most of the conspirators abandoned the scheme leaving Mowbray and his fellow conspirator William of Eu exposed. The incident that brought the matter to a head was Mowbray seizing four Norwegian vessels lying in the Tyne. The merchants who owned the vessels complained to the king and Mowbray was commanded to attend the Curia Regis to explain his actions. Mowbray did not attend and ignored further summonses, so that William finally led an army against him. Mowbray shut himself up in his stronghold, Bamburgh Castle. William laid siege to Bamburgh and built a temporary siege castle alongside it, known as Malvoisin, or \\"evil neighbour\\". For some reason, during the siege, Mowbray left the castle with a small force of knights and was pursued by his besiegers, being forced to take refuge in Tynemouth. After a siege of six days he was wounded in the leg, captured and was taken back to Bamburgh where his wife was still resisting the besiegers. She finally surrendered the castle after the besiegers threatened to blind her husband. Imprisonment and death As a result of his part in the rebellion Mowbray forfeited his estates and was imprisoned for life, initially at Windsor Castle. He spent many years in prisons, \\"growing old without offspring\\", according to the chronicler, Florence of Worcester, and then was allowed to become a monk at St Albans Abbey, according to another chronicler Orderic Vitalis. Mowbray‚Äôs fellow conspirators, William of Eu and William of Aldrie, received harsher punishment, William of Eu being castrated and blinded, and William of Aldrie being condemned to death. Legacy Orderic Vitalis gives the following description of Robert de Mowbray: \\"Powerful, rich, bold, fierce in war, haughty, he despised his equals and, swollen with vanity, disdained to obey his superiors. He was of great stature, strong, swarthy and hairy. Daring and crafty, stern and grim, he was given more to meditation than speech, and in conversation scarce ever smiled\\".Ordericus Vitalis, The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy, Vol. III, trans. Thomas Forester (London: Henry G. Bohn, 1854), pp. 17-18 Mowbray's wife, Matilda, was granted an annulment of her marriage by Pope Paschal II on the basis of consanguinity, and sometime after 1107 she became the wife of a kinsman of her former husband, Nigel d'Aubigny, who was also granted the lands in Montbray forfeited by her former husband. The couple remained childless and in 1118 d‚ÄôAubigny divorced Matilda and married Gundred de Gournay, daughter of Gerard de Gournay and Edith de Warenne. They had a son, Roger, who inherited the estates originally forfeited by Robert Mowbray. On receiving his inheritance Roger changed his name to Mowbray at the instruction of Henry I. Thus the name Mowbray was continued, but with no blood line from Robert de Mowbray.

See the main text for an analysis. Sunglint is a phenomenon that occurs when sunlight reflects off the surface of the ocean at the same angle that a satellite or other sensor is viewing the surface. In the affected area of the image, smooth ocean water becomes a silvery mirror, while rougher surface waters appear dark. Sometimes the sunglint region of satellite images reveals interesting ocean or atmospheric features that the sensor does not typically record. As an example of interesting features revealed by sunglint, the accompanying image shows a large, overlapping wave pattern in the sunglint region of an image of Indonesia (the islands at the top of the image) and Australia (the landmass at the bottom of the image). The wave pattern seen in the image is not from large ocean waves, however. The pattern is of atmospheric gravity waves above the surface of the ocean. They form when buoyancy pushes air up, and gravity pulls it back down. On its descent into the low-point of the wave (the trough), the air touches the surface of the ocean, roughening the water. The long, vertical dark lines show where the troughs of gravity waves have roughened the surface. The brighter regions show the crests of the atmospheric waves. Beneath the crests, the water is calm and reflects light directly back towards the sensor. Clouds commonly form at the crests of the waves, and such clouds are visible throughout this scene.

His botany career was spent mainly as a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. In his private life he contributed to the historical and geographical understanding of his native New Brunswick. Early life and education He was born in Carleton (now West Saint John), New Brunswick, in 1864, the eldest of seven children. He is the brother of Susie, Arthur, Edwin, and Kit Ganong Whidden. At the age of seven, the family moved to St. Stephen where his father, James Harvey Ganong and uncle Gilbert Ganong established the now-famous Ganong Brothers candy factory. It was expected that young William would enter the family business when he came of age, but early on, he showed an interest in the natural world. These interests extended to botany, reading, maps, and exploring the countryside. He also showed a talent for languages. Through his life he would come to have at least a working knowledge of French, German, Maliseet and Mi'kmaq. He was an early naturalist and by the age of seventeen, he had first-hand knowledge of numerous rivers and coastal areas of New Brunswick as well as the flora and fauna of the province. His explorations would continue throughout his life, both on his own and with one or more companions including Arthur H. Pierce, Mauran I. Furbish and George Upham Hay. He attended the University of New Brunswick where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884 and his master's degree in 1886. The next year, he went to Boston where in 1887, he received an A.B. from Harvard University. He obtained a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1894 and published two papers in the German language. It was probably at Harvard that he met Jean Murray Carman, sister of his friend and fellow Harvard student, New Brunswick poet Bliss Carman. They married in 1888. The marriage lasted thirty-two years until her death in 1920. They had no children. Career in botany After graduating from Harvard, Ganong was appointed an assistant instructor in botany there. He stayed at Harvard for a few years until May 1894, when he accepted an appointment as Professor of Botany at Smith College. It was a position he would fill for 36 years. He was also director of the Botanic Garden at Smith. Ganong , was responsible for developing the Garden, which had been laid out by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1893. Ganong expanded and revised Olmsted's planting specifications to make the entire campus an arboretum, and they reworked the herbaceous beds as a \\"systematics garden\\" after the Engler-Prantl classification system. The outdoor environment at Smith thus became (and remains) a place of learning for students of botany and horticulture. The greenhouses at Smith College date from Ganong's tenure there beginning in 1894. By authoring several books including The Teaching Botanist, A Laboratory Manual for Plant Physiology, The Living Plant, and A Textbook of Botany for Colleges, Ganong was able to establish and maintain an international reputation in botany. Under his administration, Smith's Botany department reached a peak in student enrollment, size of staff, and number of courses. He ensured that the range and quality of equipment available to students was high, and the department was able to attain a positive academic reputation. Enrollment in the introductory elective class peaked at 182 in 1926.Department of Botany Records, 1892-1966 at asteria.fivecolleges.edu Dr. Ganong retired from Smith College in 1932. He was elected President of the Botanical Society of America in 1907. Historian and cartographer Ganong undertook historical work during his teaching career. In summers, he would return to New Brunswick to study and document the historical geography of the province. Among his surveys were St. Croix Island, site of Champlain's first settlement in North America in 1604. He acquired a working knowledge of the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq languages, and with that understanding and consultation with linguists and native historians, he undertook an investigation of the aboriginal place names in the Maritime Provinces, publishing a series of six articles in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada between 1911 and 1928. In 1889 he presented a paper on the cartography of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence from the 1530s to 1604. Later, in the 1930s, he published an additional nine articles in the Transactions on what he termed the crucial maps in the early cartography and place-nomenclature of the region. The articles were drawn together and published in book form by the University of Toronto Press in 1964. His work on place-nomenclature is still widely referenced. In his explorations, he also had a chance to name several geographical features in the largely unexplored central and northern parts of New Brunswick, including Mount Carleton, the highest summit in the province, which he named after the first Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, Thomas Carleton. Another mountain to the north of Mount Carleton was named for Ganong in 1901 by his friend and naturalist Mauran Furbish.Who Was Who in Name Study at www.wtsn.binghamton.edu As a scientist, Ganong brought a special quality to the study of New Brunswick history, which featured an emphasis on map-based studies and in determining the exact location of key historic sites. He actually went to the places he wrote about. As a translator and editor of the 17th-century Acadian narratives of Nicolas Denys and Father Chr√©tien Le Clercq he became a foremost scholar of the Acadian period. He frequently contributed articles on Samuel de Champlain to publications of the New Brunswick Historical Society, the New Brunswick Magazine and Acadiensis. In addition to document-based research and translation, Ganong prepared maps, took photographs and gave slide presentations. He often collaborated with others. One frequent collaborator was Dr. John Clarence Webster, for whom he prepared numerous maps and other contributions. He also took a great interest in the international border between New Brunswick and Maine. Because of this interest and expertise he was asked to take part in the cross-border tercentennial celebrations on the St. Croix River in 1904. In 1918, Ganong completed the translation of Volume III of Champlain's Voyages, part of a major publication of Champlain's writings by the Champlain Society.http://dev.hil.unb.ca/Texts/Acadiensis/Journal/viewarticle.php?id=13&layout;=html#no20 He was also the first to pose a scientific explanation for the often sighted Ghost Ship of Northumberland Strait suggesting it was an electrical illusion. William F. Ganong's efforts also formed a substantial basis for the establishment of the New Brunswick Museum and archives. Ganong's second marriage was to Anna Hobbet from Iowa. The couple had two children, William Francis Ganong Jr., a renowned physiologist, and Ann Ganong Seidler, professor of speech theory (now retired) and children's author. Ganong died at his summer home outside Saint John in 1941. He was 77.

The team first appeared in Action Comics #598 and proceeded to have its own ongoing title in Checkmate! In the wake of events depicted in the mini-series The OMAC Project and Infinite Crisis, Checkmate had been re-chartered as a United Nations Security Council-affiliated agency and had its own series, Checkmate (vol. 2). Publication history Cover to Checkmate (vol. 1) #33, the series' final issue. The Checkmate organization was created by Paul Kupperberg and Steve Erwin, first appearing in Action Comics #598 in 1988. The precursor to this fictional organization was known as the Agency, first appearing in Vigilante #36. Harry Stein was appointed Valentina Vostok's replacement in The Agency's command position by Amanda Waller. Stein later sought out the most stable personnel available from the American and international intelligence and law enforcement communities to form Checkmate. His agency would field only the best-trained and well-equipped of agents, working under the strictest rules of secrecy. For the organizational structure of the re-organized Agency, Stein chose the game of chess as his working model. Stein brought in Gary Washington (Knight One) and Black Thorn as Checkmate operatives, both of whom were his friends, and both of whom were introduced during his run on Vigilante. Checkmate! was at various times involved with the other government agencies in the DC Comics universe, primarily the Suicide Squad, which resulted in the crossover \\"The Janus Directive\\". Checkmate! was canceled after 33 issues but the organization continued to appear, mostly in titles related to either the government or Batman. After the events of the mini-series The OMAC Project, a precursor to the Infinite Crisis limited series, the Checkmate organization was re-organized and its title was revived with Checkmate (vol. 2). This volume ended after publication of its 31st issue, dated December 2008.Per announcement on the last page of Checkmate Issue 30, DC Comics November 2008 After the cancellation of the second volume, the team returned in the Final Crisis one-shot tie-in \\"Resist\\" by Greg Rucka and Eric Trautmann.Resistance Leaders: Rucka, Trautmann on Final Crisis Special, Newsarama, October 29, 2008 Biography =Checkmate! (vol. 1)= Biography =Organization and designation= The name Checkmate is taken from the winning move in chess, and its hierarchy is modeled after the various pieces of a chess game; one King, one Queen and several Bishops, Rooks, Knights and Pawns. The Bishops oversaw the Rooks behind the scenes while the Rooks planned missions and supervised the field agents, or Knights, and the Knights' support, the Pawns. Known employed operatives List of operatives during first series. =History= The Agency is first set up by Amanda Waller to serve as a small branch of Task Force X under the command of Colonel Valentina Vostok (formerly Negative Woman of the Doom Patrol) to perform operations worldwide considered vital to the security of American interests. She relinquishes command to Harry Stein, who recreates The Agency into a new image and organization, dubbed Checkmate, in relation to its chess-inspired organizational scheme. \\"The Janus Directive\\" Russian Checkmate Knight, artist Gabriel Morrissette. \\"The Janus Directive\\" is a crossover storyline that involves an inter-agency war between Checkmate, the Suicide Squad, and Project Atom, who are manipulated by Kobra in order to distract the United States intelligence community from his activities. Checkmate loses at least 38 Knight agents (tallying to more than two thirds of Checkmate's Knight force) and its headquarters (as well as its cover, Konig Industries) in Shelby, Virginia in the incident. In the aftermath, Sarge Steel takes Waller's place as head of Checkmate, and Checkmate relocates to a new NORAD base in Colorado. Russian Checkmate A Russian version of Checkmate () (presumably under the KGB) is introduced in the last issues of the original series run. They are admittedly underfunded, but wear armor similar to their U.S. counterparts. =In between volumes= Biography =Organization and designation= Checkmate's hierarchy is remodeled in a manner similar to that of Marvel Comics' Hellfire Club (with the organization itself more closely resembling S.H.I.E.L.D.). The chess-motif remains, but there are sets of Kings and Queens, as well as Bishops, Rooks, Knights and Pawns, divided between a Black and White set. Their functions remain the same, although neither Rooks or Pawns are seen. Pawns assist the Knights on missions, providing surveillance and backup if needed. The structure of Checkmate with two halves, Black (ops) and White (intel), may also be inspired by the CIA's original two separate halves, the Directorate of Operations and Directorate of Intelligence. Known employed operatives List of operatives between series. =History= Deathstroke, the Terminator Sarge Steel reactivates Checkmate in Deathstroke, the Terminator #17, in order to find the comatose body of Deathstroke (Slade Wilson). Phil Kramer is promoted to King and Kalia Campbell to Queen. Harry Stein is said to be on indefinite leave of absence after his son is shot, and to be spending more time with his family. Gary Washington and two other Knights appear in the story as well (one of whom might be Winston O'Donnel, who appears in Deathstroke, the Terminator #19). Checkmate Knights invade the lair of supervillainess Cheshire in Deathstroke, the Terminator #18, but most are killed by her operatives and a revived Slade Wilson. Just as two Checkmate agents are about to defeat Deathstroke, Roy Harper (at that time also known as Speedy) knocks them down, revealing to be helping Cheshire as a double agent in both Checkmate and the Brotherhood of Evil. The Russian outfit of Checkmate appears when Deathstroke, Cheshire, Speedy and others try to steal a group of nuclear warheads in Russia. It is revealed that Harper called in Checkmate and that he was working on their side all along. Ultimately, Deathstroke is also revealed to be working for the CIA, and joins up with the American and Russian Checkmate to invade Cheshire's base later, after she threatens the world (unleashing a nuclear warhead on the country of Qurac as leverage). They are able to defeat Cheshire, and the warheads are destroyed. \\"Knight Moves\\" A man called David Said has taken over the role of King within the organization, and in the \\"Knight Moves\\" storyline Checkmate invades the Batcave, in order to recruit the Huntress in the process. On Batman's word, she agrees to temporarily assume the mantle of Queen, using this position to relay information to Batman on at least one occasion. Bruce Wayne - Murderer? After the events of Bruce Wayne: Murderer? and Bruce Wayne: Fugitive, his bodyguard and partner Sasha Bordeaux is framed for the murder of Vesper Fairchild. She is recruited as a Checkmate operative by Jessica Midnight, as the two fake her death and Sasha undergoes plastic surgery. The OMAC Project It is revealed that Maxwell Lord has assumed the position of Black King within the Checkmate organization with the intent of manipulating the agency to kill all of the metahumans present on Earth. While DC did not explain how or when Lord came to power (or had seemingly gone from supporting metahuman involvement in the protection of the planet to this personality), it has been implied that Checkmate may have been the victim of Superboy-Prime, who warped the very fabric of reality by punching the walls of his prison outside this dimension. As a result of Superboy-Prime's actions, the hierarchy of Checkmate was changed and a changed Maxwell Lord was suddenly in charge of the organization. In order to hide his activities, which included hijacking and reprogramming to his own purposes the super-spy satellite Brother I that Batman originally built to monitor all metahumans, Lord murdered former ally Ted Kord. He also mind-controlled Superman, sending the hero after other former allies such as Batman and Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman then proceeded to kill Lord in order to break his control on Superman's mind, which left Checkmate dismantled as an organization. 52 In 52 Week 24, Martian Manhunter reveals that he has spent months undercover undermining the remnants of Checkmate to convince the President of the U.S. to disband the organization. Within days, however, it is reconstituted as a United Nations agency. In Week 25, Alan Scott reveals to Mister Terrific that he will lead the agency as White King, and asks him to join as well. =Checkmate (vol. 2)= Greg Rucka about Checkmate (vol. 2) Rucka was quoted regarding the new series: \\"Take a big chunk of The OMAC Project, take the concept of \\"Who Watches the Watchmen?\\" and throw in some James Bond and you've got Checkmate\\". Rucka's stated plans in several interviews include depicting the repurposing of Checkmate as a United Nations- affiliated intelligence/intervention force with a specific purpose of maintaining \\"balance\\" between Earth's human and metahuman communities in the wake of events in The OMAC Project and Infinite Crisis. =Biography= Organization and designation Pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1696, Checkmate is reorganized as the UN‚Äôs Chartered Metahuman Monitoring Force. The organization was restructured utilizing the ‚ÄúRule of Two‚Äù. Each super-powered or otherwise enhanced member in the ‚ÄúRoyal Family‚Äù must have an un-powered counterpart in a corresponding position of power. Pawns still remain as low-level field agents. The Rooks make their first appearance in issue #25 as Checkmate's highly powerful black ops squad (while the Knights are \\"Special Agents\\" and Bishops \\"Advisers\\"). Specifically they include four operatives of different specialties one being Cinnamon, the second Gravedigger, Sebastian Faust, and a new incarnation of the G.I. Robot. They are further augmented with DNA from Starro the Conqueror which links them telepathically allowing instantaneous communication. The android member however cannot take a dose of the DNA but is still able to communicate telepathically with the group. One of the android's other functions is to monitor his teammates to make sure they do not lose control. If that situation were to arise, he is supposed to kill them, or as the Black Queen puts it \\"terminate the link\\". The organization's headquarters is a castle in the Swiss Alps known only as \\"The Castle\\". =History= *In A Game of Kings (issues #1-4), the UN votes on Checkmate's existence, but China vetoes this as they are supplying Kobra. Checkmate infiltrates a Chinese base, confronting the Great Ten with aid from Alan Scott, who is removed from the organisation for not embarrassing China. *In Selection (#5), Black Queen Sasha Bordeaux tests Checkmate agents to select her new Knight (the previous one having died in the first arc). The outgoing White King taps his Bishop, Mister Terrific, as his successor. *In Rogue Squad (#6-7), a new Suicide Squad hunts down an imprisoned metahuman in Myanmar; despite heavy losses, the Squad frees the prisoner and are rescued by Bronze Tiger and Rick Flag, raising suspicion among the royals due to Waller's involvement. *In Pawn 502 (#8-10), the Department of Metahuman Affairs arrests a terrorist cell trying to join Kobra, unaware one of the members is a covert Checkmate agent. Checkmate deputizes the Shadowpact to help orchestrate the agent's escape and to get him through Kobra's mystical screening process. *In Corvalho (#11-12), Waller rigs the Santa Prisca election to stop Bane winning, but Colonel Computron defects to Checkmate with proof of the falsification. Though Tommy Jagger beats Bane, Fire kills Computron under blackmail from Waller. *In Checkout (#13-15, crossover with Outsiders, alternating with Outsiders #47-49, starting in Checkmate #13 and ending in Outsiders #49), Checkmate abducts the Outsiders, where they are given a deal; they can keep operating if they work for Checkmate. Sasha, Nightwing and Captain Boomerang are captured by Chang Tzu, but are rescued with help from Batman. *In Past Perfect (#16) Sasha is examined by Doctor Mid-Nite after being tortured, Fire is reunited with the recently resurrected Ice and August General in Iron becomes the new Black King's Bishop. *In Firewall (#17) former villain Carl Draper defends The Castle against a series of assaults and is appointed Castellan, The Castle's chief of security. *In Fall of the Wall (#18-20) the other Royals continue to gather evidence that Waller is secretly conducting her own covert operations. With the assistance of Martian Manhunter they learn about Operation: Salvation Run and succeed in forcing Waller to resign. *La Vie en Sang (#21-22) explores the history of Mademoiselle Marie and how it connects to the title's current holder, the Black Queen's Knight. *Castling (#23-25) concludes the plot begun in Pawn 502. Kobra launches a worldwide attack, and Checkmate must deputize the Justice League and activate its Rooks to save the world. *Chimera (#26-31) brings the series to an end as a shapeshifting bioweapon devised by Checkmate scientists fights an apocalypse of monsters. Brightest Day At the start of the Brightest Day crossover, Maxwell Lord returns from the dead and uses his mental abilities to erase all memories of his existence from everyone on the planet, save for several former members of the Justice League International.Brightest Day #0 Following this, Lord discredits Fire (who is one of the heroes who still remembers him) by forcing everyone at Checkmate to believe that she has failed a psychological evaluation and has begun to show signs of mental instability. Fire is subsequently dismissed from Checkmate by Taleb Beni Khalid.Justice League: Generation Lost #2 The members of the new Justice League International eventually infiltrate Checkmate headquarters by disguising themselves in stolen Rocket Red suits, but the mission goes awry and they are forced to flee before they can capture Lord.Justice League: Generation Lost #8-9 Max eventually tells Blue Beetle that one of the major goals of his plot was to have the Justice League International discredit Checkmate by making them look incompetent, causing the United Nations to pull their funding and fire Khalid and most of the other senior Checkmate higher- ups, leaving Max the opportunity to regain control of the organization.Justice League: Generation Lost #19 At the very end of the series, Lord is still shown to be in control of Checkmate. He then releases a video onto the internet where he blames the rogue superhero Magog for an accident in Chicago that resulted in the deaths of a thousand civilians, and vows to use Checkmate's resources to keep an eye on similar superheroes and prevent future metahuman catastrophes.Justice League: Generation Lost #24 Known employed operatives See list of operatives during the second series. In addition, Checkmate has the authority to temporarily \\"deputize\\" anyone else they see fit. Checkmate currently uses the Blackhawk organization for most of its mission transportation. In other media =Television= The Checkmate organization appears in the Smallville episode \\"Absolute Justice\\" and is one of the plots in the later episodes of Season 9. Amanda Waller is a ranking agent using the alias White Queen. The organization is responsible for the prosecution of the Justice Society of America at some undefined point in the past, apparently the 60s, leading to their disbanding. In the present, Waller recruits Icicle to attack and kill JSA members. She does not initially tell him that she intends him to fail but succeed in bringing the team back together again, so that she can use them to battle what she describes as a \\"coming Apokolips\\". Waller manipulates Lois Lane into revealing the existence of the JSA in a positive light, and has Tess Mercer as one of her agents. She attempts to 'recruit' the team in \\"Checkmate\\", capturing Green Arrow and luring Martian Manhunter and 'the Blur' into her headquarters by threatening Watchtower in response to the 'alien invasion' of Kandor, but a power cut triggered by Green Arrow allows the Blur to save the Watchtower and escape, Manhunter subsequently erases Waller's memories of their real faces. In the episode \\"Charade\\", wealthy business tycoon Maxwell Lord is introduced as The Black King. A third faction of Checkmate was also introduced, led by the Red Queen, who opposed Waller and Lord. The Red Queen was eventually revealed to be Martha Kent. =Video games= Checkmate appears in DC Universe Online.

Semantic lexicons are built upon semantic networks, which represent the semantic relations between words. The difference between a semantic lexicon and a semantic network is that a semantic lexicon has definitions for each word, or a \\"gloss\\". Structure Semantic lexicons are made up of lexical entries. These entries are not orthographic, but semantic, eliminating issues of homonymy and polysemy. These lexical entries are interconnected with semantic relations, such as hyperonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, or troponymy. Synonymous entries are grouped together in what the Princeton WordNet calls \\"synsets\\" Most semantic lexicons are made up of four different \\"sub-nets\\": nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, though some researchers have taken steps to add an \\"artificial node\\" interconnecting the sub-nets. =Nouns= Nouns are ordered into a taxonomy, structured into a hierarchy where the broadest and most encompassing noun is located at the top, such as \\"thing\\", with the nouns becoming more and more specific the further they are form the top. The very top noun in a semantic lexicon is called a unique beginner. The most specific nouns (those that do not have any subordinates), are terminal nodes. Semantic lexicons also distinguish between types, where a type of something has characteristics of a thing such as a Rhodesian Ridgeback being a type of dog, and instances, where something is an example of said thing, such as Dave Grohl is an instance of a musician. Instances are always terminal nodes because they are solitary and don‚Äôt have other words or ontological categories belonging to them. Semantic lexicons also address meronymy, which is a ‚Äúpart-to-whole‚Äù relationship, such as keys are part of a laptop. The necessary attributes that define a specific entry are also necessarily present in that entry‚Äôs hyponym. So, if a computer has keys, and a laptop is a type of computer, then a laptop must have keys. However, there are many instances where this distinction can become vague. A good example of this is the item chair. Most would define a chair as having legs and a seat (as in the part one sits on). However, there are some very ‚Äúartistic‚Äù and ‚Äúmodern‚Äù chairs in overpriced boutiques that do not have legs at all. Beanbags also do not have legs, but few would argue that they aren't chairs. Questions like this are the core questions that drive research and work in the fields of taxonomy and ontology. =Verbs= Verb synsets are arranged much like their noun counterparts: the more general and encompassing verbs are near the top of the hierarchy while troponyms (verbs that describe a more specific way of doing something) are grouped beneath. Verb specificity moves along a vector, with the verbs becoming more and more specific in reference to a certain quality. For example. The set \\"walk / run / sprint\\" becomes more specific in terms of the speed, and \\"dislike / hate / abhor\\" becomes more specific in terms of the intensity of the emotion. The ontological groupings and separations of verbs is far more arguable than their noun counterparts. It is widely accepted that a dog is a type of animal and that a stool is a type of chair, but it can be argued that abhor is on the same emotional plane as hate (that they are synonyms and not super/subordinates). It can also be argued that love and adore are synonyms, or that one is more specific than the other. Thus, the relations between verbs are not as agreed-upon as that of nouns. Another attribute of verb synset relations is that there are also ordered into verb pairs. In these pairs, one verb necessarily entails the other in the way that massacre entails kill, and know entails believe. These verb pairs can be troponyms and their superordinates, as is the case in the first example, or they can be in completely different ontological categories, as in the case in the second example. = Adjectives = Adjective synset relations are very similar to verb synset relations. They are not quite as neatly hierarchical as the noun synset relations, and they have fewer tiers and more terminal nodes. However, there are generally less terminal nodes per ontological category in adjective synset relations than that of verbs. Adjectives in semantic lexicons are organized in word pairs as well, with the difference being that their word pairs are antonyms instead of entailments. More generic polar adjectives such as hot and cold, or happy and sad are paired. Then other adjectives that are semantically similar are linked to each of these words. Hot is linked to warm, heated, sizzling, and sweltering, while cold is linked to cool, chilly, freezing, and nippy. These semantically similar adjectives are considered indirect antonyms to the opposite polar adjective (i.e. nippy is an indirect antonym to hot). Adjectives that are derived from a verb or a noun are also directly linked to said verb or noun across sub-nets. For example, enjoyable is linked to the semantically similar adjectives agreeable, and pleasant, as well as to its origin verb, enjoy. = Adverbs = There are very few adverbs accounted for in semantic lexicons. This is because most adverbs are taken directly from their adjective counterparts, in both meaning and form, and changed only morphologically (i.e. happily is derived from happy, and luckily is derived from lucky, which is derived from luck). The only adverbs that are accounted for specifically are ones without these connections, such as really, mostly, and hardly.  Challenges facing semantic lexicons  The effects of the Princeton WordNet project extend far past English, though most research in the field revolves around the English language. Creating a semantic lexicon for other languages has proved to be very useful for Natural Language Processing applications. One of the main focuses of research in semantic lexicons is linking lexicons of different languages to aid in machine translation. The most common approach is to attempt to create a shared ontology that serves as a ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù of sorts between semantic lexicons of two different languages. This is an extremely challenging and as-of-yet unsolved issue in the Machine Translation field. One issue arises from the fact that no two languages are word-for-word translations of each other. That is, every language has some sort of structural or syntactic difference from every other. In addition, languages often have words that don‚Äôt translate easily into other languages, and certainly not with an exact word-to-word match. Proposals have been made to create a set framework for wordnets. Research has shown that every known human language has some sort of concept resembling synonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, and antonymy. However, every idea so far proposed has been met with criticism for using a pattern that works best for English and less for other languages. Another obstacle in the field is that no solid guidelines exist for semantic lexicon framework and contents. Each lexicon project in each different language has had a slightly (or not so slightly) different approach to their wordnet. There is not even an agreed- upon definition of what a ‚Äúword‚Äù is. Orthographically, they are defined as a string of letters with spaces on either side, but semantically it becomes a very debated upon subject. For example, though it is not difficult to define dog or rod as words, but what about guard dog or lightning rod? The latter two examples would be considered orthographically separate words, though semantically they make up one concept: one is a type of dog and one is a type of rod. In addition to these confusions, wordnets are also idiosyncratic, in that they do not consistently label items. They are redundant, in that they often have several words assigned to each meaning (synsets). They are also open-ended, in that they often focus on and extend into terminology and domain-specific vocabulary.

She served as the city's inaugural Mayor from December 1, 2005, until January 7, 2014, when Rusty Paul took office as the city's second mayor. Early life and education Born Eva Cohn in Berlin, Germany, her father was a judge. He was ousted from his position, along with other prominent Jews, in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came to power. The family then moved to Genoa, Italy, where they lived for six years before coming to the United States and settling in Athens, Georgia, where her father got a job at the University of Georgia with the help of prominent alumnus Harold Hirsch. Galambos attended Athens High School and graduated as valedictorian in 1944. She later graduated from the University of Georgia in 1948 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Later in life she earned a master's degree (M.A.) in labor and industrial relations from the University of Illinois and a Ph.D. in economics from Georgia State University. She was the recipient of the 2011 Andrew Young School Distinguished Alumni Award from the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. Labor activism An activist, who advocated for workers, Galambos landed her first professional job as Associate Editor of the Atlanta Journal of Labor, writing local copy to interest the union members. Her \\"love for activism\\" extended to campaigning for rent control in the city of Atlanta. While \\"thanked\\" for her research, the practice, adopted in New York, was not enacted in a Southern city more sensitive to issues of government overreach. The Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck, a housing expert, quipped that \\"rent control appears to be the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city ‚Äì except for bombing\\". Galambos later obtained a position, working on behalf of the International Association of Machinists. She was a labor economist for many years, teaching at Clark Atlanta University and Georgia State University. Politics Galambos had held various positions in the Sandy Springs community before being elected the first mayor of the city in early November 2005. She was the president of the Committee for Sandy Springs, 1975‚Äì2005, which fought to incorporate Sandy Springs. She was also a co-founder and former secretary of Sandy Springs Revitalization; founder of Sandy Springs Clean and Beautiful; chairwoman of services committee for the Sandy Springs Council of Neighborhoods; former chairwoman of the Fulton County Public Housing Authority; and founder of Sandy Springs Civic Roundtable. Death She died of cancer on April 19, 2015, at the age of 86. Her funeral was held at Temple Kehillat Chaim in Roswell, Georgia on April 21, 2015.

The company's headquarters is in Millbank Street, Northam and it has a chain of outlets in and around Hampshire and Dorset. It also operates an online tool warehouse that serves the whole of the United Kingdom. Elliott Brothers and Elliotts Premier Roofing constitute the two components of the holding company, Elliott Brothers Limited. The company can trace its origins to October 1840 when 26-year-old Thomas Elliott took over the Southampton business of Robert Young who had died earlier in the year. Young's business had been based at Godfrey's Town on the banks of the River Itchen about 0.5 km south-west of the headquarters of the present-day company. Within five years Thomas had purchased a nearby cement works and had extended the range of products sold to include cement, lime, bricks, chimneypieces and many other items. Over the ensuing 40 years until his death in 1886 Thomas continued to expand the firm though at a slower rate. Meanwhile, his brother John was involved with the building and restoration of several churches around Southampton and in Sussex until his death in 1891. Shortly before his death Thomas handed over control of the firm to two of his sons, Frank and Walter, and it was they who first gave the firm the name Elliott Brothers. They reinvigorated the enterprise and, by 1893, it merited the description \\"General Builders Merchants\\". In 1901 the firm was incorporated with the name Elliott Brothers Ltd. The doubling of Southampton's population between 1890 and 1920 stimulated a further increase in Elliotts' business and, by the late 1930s, annual sales were regularly exceeding ¬£50,000. Sales plummeted during World War II but, by 1956, when Elliotts' first branch was opened at Bishop's Waltham, they were on the increase again. Between 1960 and 1973 turnover increased sixfold and, in 1980, turnover passed the ¬£5 million mark. In 1982 a second branch was opened at Fareham. New branches continued to be opened until, by 2015, including the Millbank headquarters, there were 13 outlets in Hampshire and Dorset.  Thomas and John Elliott and Robert Young  Thomas Christopher Elliott Thomas Christopher Elliott, born 1814, was one of the six children of John Elliott and his wife Maria n√©e Strong of Lewes, Sussex. John senior was a grocer and wine merchant with a shop at 49 High Street, Lewes. The Elliott family of Sussex can be traced back to a Thomas Elliott who died in Bury north of Arundel in 1551. The family had lived in that area of west Sussex until John senior moved to Lewes during the first decade of the 19th century. The sons of John and Maria Elliott involved in the early years of the firm were Thomas Elliott and John Elliott Jr. However, they were not the brothers to which the present-day name of the company refers. They were Thomas's sons, Frank and Walter, to whom he handed over the enterprise. During the mid-1830s, working at first from their father's shop, Thomas and his older brother John, born 1811, operated as commissioning agents for emigration to the colonies. Later in the decade John moved west to Chichester where he set up business as an architect, builder and writer on architectural subjects. There he designed the Corn Exchange and the east wing and ballroom of Goodwood House near Chichester. Both buildings were erected in 1837. In 1838, John was commissioned to design and build St James' Church in the Sussex village of Emsworth, close to the Hampshire border. On 14September 1841, he married Maria Martin of Cheltenham in Chichester and, three weeks later, when his neo-Norman church at Emsworth was consecrated, John and his new wife would undoubtedly have been present. In 1840, John began work on the build of a new chapel of ease in Broadwater, near Worthing but, during its construction, the church authorities who had commissioned and approved the design, change their minds. As a result of their failing to reach agreement with Elliott they refused to pay him and he was driven into bankruptcy. In subsequent years John Elliott was involved in many projects relating to churches in Sussex and Hampshire. Most of these involved restoration but he also received the occasional commission to design and build a new church. After his experiences in Worthing, he was always careful to get a binding agreement before he started work. St James' Church, Emsworth.In 1839, Thomas was still in his father's shop in Lewes but, during the following year, he moved to Southampton and took up lodgings in the home of Robert Young and his wife Charlotte n√©e Shayer. They lived in St Mary's Cottage, St Mary's Place, in the parish of St Mary's. Charlotte was related to the Southampton painter William Shayer. Robert Young started his working life as a slater but, in 1826, he also became the landlord of the Crown and Anchor Inn, in Four-Posts in the Southampton suburb of Freemantle. He therefore transferred the slate business to the inn. By the mid 1830s, he had given up the inn and had become slate merchant, slater and general builder. By the time Robert Young died August 1840, Thomas Elliott may already have taken up residence in St Mary's Cottage. By October that year, it had been agreed between him and Charlotte that he should take over Robert's business. Charlotte Young died in April 1852. During 1841 and 1842, when Thomas was in the early stages of developing the business that he had taken over from Young, John was still living in Chichester but he too was soon to move to Southampton.  The early days  Hampshire Advertiser, October 1840 After his 1826 advertisement announcing his relocation, Robert Young had never advertised his business and it had remained small. However, when Thomas Elliott took over the business an advertisement to that effect did appear in the Hampshire Advertiser of 17October 1840. Young's stores and works in Godfrey's Town had been on the west bank of the lower reaches of the River Itchen. During his first two years, Elliott also based his operations there. But he was determined to expand and, in the late summer of 1842, the opportunity arose to purchase the business of the London Cement Works. The proprietor was one William Hale and, as implied by his 1841 advertisement, the cement was not produced in London but rather was manufactured on the 'London principle'. Elliott took the opportunity to purchase the cement works and, on 17September 1842, an advertisement to that effect appeared in the Advertiser. They were situated on the banks of the River Itchen adjacent to Millbank Wharf, Northam, only north of the Godfrey's Town stores that Elliott had purchased from Robert Young. Godfrey's Town was also known as Crabniton and is marked as such on the 1871 Ordnance Survey town plan of Southampton. With the acquisition of Hale's works, Elliott could add Roman cement, Plaster of Paris, various types of lime and gypsum to his stock list. The Millbank works became the base of Elliott's operations and has remained as such ever since. In his bid to expand the business, Elliott inserted frequent advertisements in the Advertiser and also in the Southampton directories of 1843, 1845 and 1847. The 1845 advertisement, perhaps for the last time also mentions the commission agency that he and John had been operating both in Southampton and Chichester. Soon after, that activity was discontinued. In 1843, Thomas Elliott took a lease out on a property just across the river at 2 Bridge Road, Itchen. It became the home not only of Thomas himself, but also for John and Maria. It was also used as an office by both brothers. To get to the Millbank site, Thomas would have crossed the river by means of the Itchen ferry and the Woolston Floating Bridge that had been constructed in 1836. By the time of his marriage in 1847, Thomas Elliott had moved to Portswood Villa in Portswood leaving the use of the Bridge Road property. to John, Maria and Agnes, the daughter who had been born to them in 1844. By 1849, Thomas Elliott had extended his business to the sale of bricks, tiles, chimney pieces, dairy fittings, baths, washstands, cattle troughs and paint. Meanwhile, John was engaged in a survey of old churches for the diocese of Chichester. He had become honorary architect to the Sussex Diocesan Association and had already participated in the rebuilding of several churches in Sussex. In the late 1840s, Thomas was involved in the building of about 30 houses on Millbank Street, a road that ran north-east from the wharf. It is very likely John too partook in the project as he had already published an essay on the construction of cottages. Also in the late 1840s, by taking out leases on adjoining land, Thomas doubled its original acreage of the Millbank site. In the 1850s and 1860s both Thomas and John Elliott were involved in the sale and rent of property.  The descendants of Thomas Elliott  On 5October 1847, Thomas Elliott married Mary Jane Mason, the second daughter of Thomas Mason, town clerk of Doncaster in Yorkshire. Over the first twenty years of their marriage, Mary was to bear Thomas ten children three of whom, Frank (1852‚Äì1918), Walter (1857‚Äì1935) and Frederick (1855‚Äì1928), were to play important parts in the family firm. A fourth, Edgar (1861‚Äì1937), was to run a brewing enterprise that Thomas had started in the 1870s. Mary's surname was later used in the given names of about 15 descendants of Thomas and Mary. Four of them were to play important parts in the operation of the firm: *Edgar's son, Newlyn Mason Elliott (1890‚Äì1968), known as Mason, managing director 1935‚Äì1966. *Mason's son, George Edgar Newlyn Mason Elliott (1924‚Äì2007), known as Newlyn Mason, chairman 1969‚Äì1985. *Newlyn Mason's son, Stuart Graham Mason- Elliott (born 1951), known as Stuart, the current chairman. *Stuart's son, Thomas Edgar Mason Elliott (born 1984), known as Tom, the current managing director.  The later years of the 19th century  By 1864, Thomas Elliott and Robert Young before him had been manufacturing Roman cement on the banks of the Itchen for over 40 years. Roman cement is a natural product and its manufacture does not generate particularly obnoxious fumes. However, in 1864, Elliott started producing Portland cement, the manufacture of which releases pollutants, notably sulphur dioxide. As a result of complaints from neighbours, Elliott was taken to court. Whilst three hearings were taking place in late 1865 Elliott implemented measures designed to reduce the nuisance. These were found sufficient for the case to be dismissed. However, at the same time, a further summons was taken out against him and, this time, he was fined ¬£5 with costs. The costs were much greater than the fine itself for, all told, Elliott was the poorer by ¬£150. For Thomas Elliott the 1860s and 1870s would have been a period of consolidation. He no longer needed to advertise regularly. A few small classified advertisements appeared from time to time but no large display advertisements were placed. Also there were occasional advertisements for the sale or let of houses, sometimes inserted by John. In 1871, Thomas Elliott's firm had over 30 employees including his sons, Frank and Walter. At about same time, in partnership with Henry Vincent, he acquired a Southampton brewery along with four Public houses. In January 1883, Thomas transferred as a gift the whole of his business to Frank and Walter who gave it the name of Elliott Brothers. When Thomas himself died aged 71, on 26April 1886, his estate amounted to close on ¬£84,000 ‚Äì a very considerable sum for the time. The estate included a house at Bassett Mount with stabling, gardens, meadows, land and all household effects plus his interests both in the Millbank Works and the brewery. By comparison, his brother John, who died in 1891 in Uckfield, Sussex, left only ¬£583. Frank and Walter Elliott gave new life to a firm that had perhaps stagnated somewhat during the last 20 years of their father's life. They acquired of the freehold of Millbank Wharf, started advertising again and extended the range of products. Even include coal was included amongst the commodities for sale. In an 1891 display advertisement, coal and slate featured as the most prominent products. At around this time, a 74-ton sailing vessel, the Alice Moor, was acquired or commissioned by the firm to transport the slates from Porthmadog to Millbank Wharf. But, unfortunately, in January 1901, the vessel was driven ashore and badly damaged at whilst leaving Porthmadog. Although the damage was repaired, Elliotts no longer used the schooner. It was destroyed in 1904 in a fire off Yarmouth. In a comprehensive article published in 1893 the firm was for the first time referred to as \\"General Builders' Merchants\\". Mention was made of their large showroom, their wharf from which they could dispatch goods to all parts of the country and the fact that they had become agents for Beaulieu white and red bricks. Elliott Brothers continued to operate the brickworks on the Beaulieu estate of Lord Montagu until 1918. A report of the building at Millbank Wharf was drawn up by professional valuers in December 1900 in anticipation of the proposed incorporation of the company following year. The report stated that the main building comprised a three-room office, two storerooms, five cement kilns, two plaster ovens, a lime mill, a rending store, a circular saw bench, an iron store, a cement store and two engine room complete with boilers. Other buildings included lime kilns, coal stores, cement sheds, brick sheds, iron stores, slurry pits, a cement-drying building, a lime house and a chimney shed. The yard had a frontage to the River Itchen of nearly and a rear frontage of . The value of the whole property was estimated at ¬£6670 freehold.  Elliott Brothers Ltd  Walter Elliott c 1900 In 1901, Elliott Brothers became a limited company and, as shown in the Articles of Association, the firm's activities were manifold. The products supplied included coal, coke, cement, lime, plaster, whiting, bricks, tiles, pottery, ironmongery and timber. Nevertheless, the sale of Welsh slates continued to be a speciality as it had been since Robert Young's time. In addition to the property mentioned in the report of the previous year the company owned a number of ships and barges. The shareholders were the brothers Frank, Walter, Frederick Elliott, their mother, Mary, and their only sister, Lillian. Frederick had previously been running a timber company in London and brought his business with him to Southampton. At the first board meeting, held at Millbank Wharf, Frank and Walter Elliott were appointed joint managing directors. Meanwhile, another brother, Edgar, was running the Southampton brewery that he had inherited from his father. He had married Emily Gale in 1888 and their first son, Mason Elliott, was born in 1890. It was during the 30 years from 1891 to 1921 that Southampton's saw its steepest rise in population, increasing from 85,000 in 1891 to 160,000 in 1921. The consequent expansion in house-building during those 30 years ‚Äì particularly in the town's northern suburbs ‚Äì stimulated a proportionate increase in Elliotts' business, particularly after its incorporation in 1901. In 1908, Edgar Elliott's son, Mason, joined the company. On 14May 1918, Frank Elliott died and his younger brother, Walter, became sole managing director of Elliott Brothers Ltd and, in 1920, Mason was elected to the board. One of Walter's first decisions was to terminate manufacture of cement and lime, an occupation that had been carried on from the earliest days of the company. In December that year, the company purchased the Bishop's Waltham Brickworks of Blanchard & Co Ltd. The Blanchard episode is related in a separate section. During the 1920s, about 9,400 new houses were built in Southampton. To meet the resulting demand for building materials, Elliotts extended their Millbank premises and acquired an adjacent corn store. In 1924, the firm took a controlling interest in the Guernsey slate and cement dealers, Valpied Ltd. But their presence in Guernsey was not to last long. The wharf adjacent to the Millbank premises had been a useful asset to the company, particularly for the import coal, slates, sea-sand and timber and of coal and coke. Although the sale of coal was discontinued in 1923, the need for a wharf remained as great as ever. In 1925, after a proposal to enlarge it proved too costly, a small jetty was built to extend it. On the night of 14June 1927, a fire broke out in the Millbank timber sheds. The fire it did not extend to the other building but the firm's only lorry was destroyed. Losses for buildings, the lorry and stock amounted to over ¬£10,000. Four new timber sheds were soon built and, during the next few years, several lorries were purchased to replace not only the burnt out one but also the horse-drawn carts that had previously been used. Frederick Elliott died on 26October 1928. At a subsequent meeting of the board it was decided that the chairmanship which, since 1918 had rotated amongst members, should in future be held permanently by Walter Elliott. At the same meeting Mason Elliott's brother, Christopher, was elected to the board. During the 1930s, by acting as agents to various companies, the company added to the range of products it supplied. New items included wood-fibre sheets, bitumen damp courses, steel scaffolding, and clay roofing tiles from France and Belgium. Items such as these contributed to annual sales figures that, during the years 1934‚Äì39, annual sales regularly exceeded ¬£50,000. On 23May 1935, Walter Elliott died. His 51 years of service with the company had only been interrupted by his wartime service in the Territorial Army during which he had reached the rank of Major. At a board meeting during the following month his nephew, Mason Elliott, was elected managing director. Like his uncle, he had served in the Territorials. It was probably he who persuaded the directors to allow Elliott employees joining the Territorials to be paid full wages whilst attending their two-weeks annual training. During his subsequent wartime service he reached the rank of Brigadier. The advent of war put an end to the buoyant pre-war sales. Average annual sales plummeted to about ¬£20,000. Anticipating war, the company had amassed a large stock of timber but, in October 1939, almost all of it was requisitioned by the government. In later years the Admiralty took over part of the stores on Millbank Street and the Ministry of Food took possession of another part of the premises for the storage of eggs. In 1941, incendiary bombs destroyed the original company offices. After five years of running the company from improvised offices, a new purpose-built office block was built in Millbank Street in 1950.  Elliotts after WWII  Elliotts Millbank site in 1992 In 1933, Mason Elliott's brother, Christopher, had taken charge of a new roofing section. In 1945 this became the basis of a new subsidiary company, Elliott Brothers (Roofing) Ltd. The annual income of the company increased from ¬£15,000 in 1945 to ¬£90,000 in 1966. Following the Christopher's death in 1969, Newlyn Mason Elliott took over as managing director. In 1973, the company was reintegrated into the main company and became first Elliotts High Performance Roofing and, in 1986, Elliotts Premier Roofing, Ltd. In 1947, Mason Elliott's son, Newlyn Mason, returned from five years army service and, in the following year, was appointed to the board. During the 1950s the company's turnover rose from ¬£110,000 to ¬£364,000. But the sale of timber sales was contributing such a small proportion of the total output that, in 1954, it was discontinued. However, thirty years later the fact that timber was not supplied by the company was putting it at a competitive disadvantage, so it was resumed. After the closure of the Blanchard brick works at Bishop's Waltham in 1956, Elliotts turned to the London Brick Company for the supply of most of their bricks. The sales of bricks from them and other sources grew until, by the 1990s, it accounted for one third of total sales. Transportation of bricks within the premises was the main beneficiary of the purchase by the company of forklift trucks in the mid-1960s. Shortly after the delivery of heavy materials to customers was eased by the acquisition of a fleet of crane trucks. In March 1966, after 45 years of service, 30 of which were as managing director, Mason Elliott handed over the reins of the company to his son, Newlyn Mason. A notable achievement in his final years was to more than double the turnover between 1960 and 1964 in which year it stood at ¬£787,000. However, his retirement was not long. He died in 1966 and, in the following year, his brother Christopher also died. In 1967, a kitchen and bathroom showroom was opened at Millbank and, after erratic growth during the 1960s, turnover topped ¬£1M for the first time in 1970. During the mid-1970s Elliott Brothers became the first point-of-sale computerised builders' merchant in the country. Both computerisation and mechanical handling contributed to increased efficiency. Although staff numbers only increased from 40 in 1938 to 90 in 1973, turnover over the same period increased 25-fold. By 1970, as result of its continuing expansion, the company needed to find more space at its Millbank headquarters. of tidal mud-land was therefore purchased from Southampton Council and a ¬£75,000 scheme of land reclamation was put into operation. The reclaimed area was concreted over and the project work, which was completed in 1973, nearly doubled the area of the Millbank site. To facilitate overseas trade, a new company, EB (International) Ltd was formed in 1974. Furthermore, a holding company, Elliott Brothers (Builders' Merchants) Ltd was established to which all the assets of Elliott Brothers Ltd and EB International were transferred. In fact the year had not been a good one the firm, or indeed for builders merchants nationally. Nevertheless, Elliott Brothers' annual group sales reached ¬£2M for the first time. Growth during the rest of the decade was significant and in 1980 turnover topped ¬£5M. Meanwhile, market conditions for builders' merchants were changing. Medium-sized and small builders had always been a stock in trade of the company. But such companies were turning to the provision of extensions and rebuilding work rather than undertaking new- builds. Furthermore, the DIY market was expanding rapidly. To meet these requirements the warehouse that fronted Millbank Street was converted into a self-selection store. During the 1980s, using the Millbank Street store as a template, branches were opened at Ringwood, Fareham, Chandler's Ford and Fordingbridge. With the headquarters at Millbank and the established branch at Bishop's Waltham, that brought the totals number of outlets to six. In the period 1990‚Äì2015 a further eight outlets were opened. The last of these, in Christchurch is the biggest so far and, being in Dorset, the first outside the county of Hampshire. In 1982‚Äì83, Newlyn Mason Elliott served as President of the Builders' Merchants Federation. Subsequently, he served in other important capacities before, in May 1985, he stepped down as managing director. He was succeeded by his son, Stuart Mason Elliott.86 However, Newlyn Mason Elliott continued as chairman until his death on 28May 2007. On 29September 2014, Elliotts acquired Hardleys, the Lymington kitchen and bathroom showroom. There were no redundancies and, after the takeover, the business carried on as before. At the awards meeting of Family Business United held in London on 11June 2015, Elliott Brothers was named the Property and Construction Family Business of the Year. , the managing director of the holding company, Elliott Brothers (Builders Merchants) Ltd, is Stuart Graham Mason Elliott. Managing director of the operating company, Elliott Brothers Ltd, is Thomas Edward Mason Elliott. The company employs almost 300 people at their 13 locations in Hampshire and Dorset. In 2014 the holding company, Elliott Brothers (Builders Merchants) Limited, returned assets of ¬£31.2M and liabilities of ¬£15.1M.  Blanchards  Blanchards after bomb damage Brick building at Bishop's Waltham dates back to the 1860s. The founder, Mark Blanchard, had died in 1892 and his son, also named Mark, took over the business. However, by 1818, he decided to retire and, as he there was no successor in the family, he decided to sell the business. Elliotts paid ¬£8,000 for the brickworks, stock and railway sidings. A new company was formed with Walter Elliott as managing director. The works were extended and equipment was renewed where necessary. Amongst other local buildings, the bricks were used for extensions to Southampton University College, the institution that was to become the University of Southampton in 1952. On the death of Walter Elliot in 1935, his nephew, Mason Elliott became chairman. During a bombing raid in the summer of 1941 the works were extensively damaged. The raid halted brick-making operations and it was not until 1947 that production was resumed. However, even by 1956 production was uneconomic with an annual output of only 1,500,000 bricks and 650,000 tiles. The site was therefore put up for auction but, there being no acceptable offers, it was withdrawn and, after redevelopment, became Elliotts' first branch sales and distribution depot. It served in this capacity until the early 1980s when Elliotts purchased the Claylands Road, Bishop's Waltham depot of Ben Turner & Son. Turners were a supplier of agricultural machinery. Their premises still serves as the Bishop's Waltham branch of Elliott Brothers.  Military service by the Elliott family  When, in 1859, there was a fear of a French invasion, Thomas Elliott became an officer of the 2nd (Southampton) Hampshire Rifle Volunteers, a battalion of the Royal Hampshire Regiment. His son, water, served in the same regiment from 1881 to 1912. At the outbreak of WWI, he founded and commanded the Southampton unit of the Volunteer Defence Corps. Several of Thomas's descendants gave voluntary military service in units that became part of the Territorial Army after its formation in 1907. Mason Elliott joined the Hampshires in 1908 and transferred to the Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery on its formation in 1910. He was commissioned in 1912 and served in Egypt and Palestine throughout the war rising to the rank of major. He was awarded the DSO in 1918. After the war he joined the Hampshire Yeomanry, a unit of the Territorials. Rising to the rank of brigadier, in 1937, he took charge of the 72nd (Hampshire) Anti-Aircraft Brigade a unit of the 35th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom). He remained in command throughout WWII and was awarded a DSO and OBE in recognition of his long and distinguished service. During World War I, Mason's younger brother, Christopher, served in India, Mesopotamia and on the Western front. Between the wars he served in the Hampshire Regiment and, in 1935, rose to the rank of Colonel. Mason's eldest son, Graham Mason Elliott, served in the Hampshire Regiment during World War II. As a platoon commander he landed with them at Arromanches on D-day, was wounded, evacuated and subsequently died.

He was born and died at Westhoughton, Lancashire. Bill Farrimond was widely regarded in the late 1920s and across the 1930s as the second best wicketkeeper in English first-class cricket, but the man regarded as the best was his Lancashire colleague George Duckworth ‚Äì and for many years both of them were kept out of the England team by Leslie Ames, who was a much better batsman. The result was that Farrimond played only a handful of county matches each season from 1925 to 1937 before, on the retirement of Duckworth, he finally played two full seasons in 1938 and 1939. Despite being second string wicketkeeper at Lancashire, Farrimond played four Tests. In 1930-31, he was picked as second wicketkeeper to Duckworth on the tour to the South Africa, and played in two matches when Duckworth was injured. Four years later, he toured the West Indies and played one Test, with regular keeper Les Ames playing just as a batsman in that match. His only home Test match was the game at Lord's in 1935 against South Africa, when Ames again played as a batsman only. An unobtrusive wicketkeeper, unlike Duckworth, Farrimond was the second wicketkeeper, after Tiger Smith, to make seven dismissals in an innings, then the world record. A useful lower order batsman, his one century came playing for the Minor Counties side. He played one first- class match in 1945, a friendly \\"Roses\\" match, but at 42 years of age he did not play again when regular cricket resumed after the Second World War.

He made one Test appearance for England, in 1931. An all-rounder, Lee was a right- handed batsman and bowled both off break and slow-medium pace bowling with his right arm. He scored 1,000 runs in a season on thirteen occasions. Part of the County Championship winning sides in 1920 and 1921, Lee aggregated 20,158 runs and took 401 wickets in first-class cricket. The son of a greengrocer, Lee worked hard to earn himself a place in the Middlesex side in the years before the First World War, eventually getting his chance in 1914 when other players had joined the early war effort. Lee enlisted in the army in September 1914 and served until December 1915; although shot in the leg, declared dead and taken prisoner of war, he survived and returned to play for Middlesex in 1919. He secured his place in the team with three strong all-round seasons, and was twice part of a top four when each batsman scored a century in the same innings‚Äîhe shares this achievement with Jack Hearne. Less prolific through the mid-1920s, he scored runs heavily once again towards the end of the decade. He made his only Test appearance in 1931, drafted into the England team after injuries and illness depleted the squad. He continued playing county cricket until 1934, when he was released by Middlesex aged 44, to allow the county to develop younger players. He umpired first-class cricket from his retirement until the Second World War, standing in 153 matches. Lee's career was overshadowed by more attractive, faster-scoring batsmen in the team, such as Hearne and Patsy Hendren. His two younger brothers also played first-class cricket; both Jack and Frank moved to Somerset after failing to break into the Middlesex team. All three brothers scored centuries during the 1931 season, the first instance of three professional brothers doing so in first-class cricket. Two years later, all three were involved in a single dismissal: Harry was caught by Frank off the bowling of Jack in a county match. At the time of his death in 1981, Lee was the second-oldest living Test cricketer. Early years Lee was born in Marylebone, London on 26 October 1890, the eldest of three boys, all of whom progressed to play first-class cricket. His father was a greengrocer and a coal merchant who followed cricket closely in the London evening papers.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 8. During Lee's youth, he developed his cricket by playing against lamp-posts, and reflected in his autobiography that: \\"If a bowler can clean bowl a man nine times out of ten against a lamp- post, he will not miss a full-sized wicket when he gets the chance.\\" His cricketing talent was encouraged at school; he first attended Barrett Street School and then St. Thomas's School in Portman Square. Both schools had headmasters who were sports enthusiasts, and at St. Thomas's the headmaster, Mr. Despicht, offered a penny to any schoolboy who could bowl him out, a feat Lee achieved regularly. Mr. Despicht also taught Lee to concentrate on bowling a good length, and Lee played primarily as a bowler during his school years. During his final year at St. Thomas's, the school reached the final of the local Church School's League Shield, and Lee earned victory for his school with six wickets.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 9‚Äì11. When Lee left school, he worked with his father as a greengrocer, a job he liked, but not enough to stop him writing a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club, asking for a job on the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 11. Along with approximately 25 other boys, Lee was invited for a trial at Lord's early in 1906, and bowled under the observation of Alfred Atfield and the head groundsman, Tom Hearne. Lee described his first over as \\"six of the worst balls that anyone can ever have pitched\\", but as his nerves calmed, he improved, and was eventually selected as one of the five ground staff boys by Hearne.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 12‚Äì13. As a ground boy, Lee had numerous tasks; sweeping, dusting and cleaning the seats, preparing nets, marking the pitch, weeding and similar. On a match day, jobs included selling scorecards, operating the score-board or fielding in the practice nets.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 14‚Äì15. All of this left little time for the boys to practise their own game. No formal coaching was in place, but Lee was guided by a few different players; England internationals Teddy Wynyard and Albert Trott among them.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 19. In the 1909 and 1910 seasons, Lee started to gain some attention from Middlesex County Cricket Club: he scored 39 runs in a match for the Middlesex Colts in 1909, and 60 runs against Reading Cricket Club in 1910.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 26. He was making more appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), collecting runs and wickets regularly, but not prolifically. In 1911, when a number of the Middlesex side were missing due to trial matches for England selection, Lee was invited to join the team for two County Championship matches in the south-west, against Somerset and Gloucestershire.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 26‚Äì27. Placed at number eleven in Middlesex's batting order, Lee batted once in a rain-affected match against Somerset, remaining four not out, and was not required to bowl. Lee did bowl against Gloucestershire, but remained wicketless from nine overs in the match. Lee was given greater opportunities in 1912, appearing seven times for Middlesex in the Championship. The first of these appearances, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, brought Lee his first wicket in first-class cricket when he caught Charles Baker off his own bowling.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 29. He claimed five wickets in the match, and another three against Nottinghamshire a month later, to total eight wickets for the season at 9.50 runs apiece and finish technically at the top of the county's bowling averages for the season. Lee joined the MCC bowling staff in 1913 at the invitation of A. J. Webbe,Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 30. but he was used sparingly in first- class cricket that season, playing just three times, all for Middlesex. In the first of these matches, Lee scored 35 not out at the end of Middlesex's innings, helping his side to avoid the follow-on. His \\"plucky knock\\" was praised by captain Pelham Warner,Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 32‚Äì33. who promoted him to bat at number five in the fourth innings, by which stage the game was heading for a draw. During 1913, although certainly not a regular in the Middlesex team, Lee asked his captain for his county cap, a request which Warner responded to with surprise that he had not already received it, and promptly asked for one to be sent down. In the 1914 season, Lee almost doubled his total of first-class appearances. Two early season appearances against Oxford and Cambridge universities brought a few runs, and a match for the MCC against Hampshire saw Lee bat at number six in both innings. He played just twice in the County Championship prior to August, both times against Warwickshire. The start of the First World War in early August initially resulted in the cancellation of Middlesex's tour of the northern counties, Yorkshire and Lancashire, but this decision was later reversed, and Middlesex took a heavily weakened side on the tour. Due to regular opening batsman William Robertson being unavailable, Lee was promoted to open the batting alongside Frank Tarrant.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 35. He scored 30 and 16 against Yorkshire, followed by 1 and 44 not out against Lancashire. Lee and Tarrant continued to open for Middlesex for the remainder of the season, and against Nottinghamshire, Lee scored his first century in first-class cricket. Having been dismissed for 17 in the first innings, Lee scored 139 runs in the second, and shared a partnership of 183 runs with Patsy Hendren, who also reached his century. First World War =Prisoner of war= Initially, even after the declaration of war, Lee did not feel that there would be any impact on his life, and was looking forward to playing cricket in the 1915 season. After learning that the MCC and Middlesex County Cricket Club were keen to support the war effort, and encountering members of the Territorial Force marching through London, Lee changed his mind and enlisted into 13th (County of London) Battalion (part of the all-Territorial Force London Regiment) in Kensington (the battalion was usually known as \\"The Kensingstons\\" as it recruited largely from that area of London) on 1 September 1914.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 41‚Äì43. At this time the pre-war battalion had been split into two, with the \\"first line\\", 1/13th Battalion, of men who had volunteered for overseas service then being based in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, this unit would be sent to France in November 1914. The \\"second line\\", 2/13th Battalion, of men who had not volunteered for overseas service and new recruits was initially at White City, London prior to moving to Maidstone, Kent in January 1915. In December 1914 a \\"third line\\" battalion, 3/13th Battalion, was formed as an additional training unit. This was based at Richmond Park. The surviving portions of Lee's service record are unclear as to which of these units he spent time with during his training. He was posted to 1/13th (County of London) Battalion on 25 February 1915, and joined them in France just over a week later.WO/372/12 44640/5700. Lee participated in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in mid-March,WO/95/1730 1/398, pp. 69‚Äì78. an Allied offensive to regain the French village of Neuve-Chapelle. The village was retaken from the Germans, but the plan to press on and also capture Aubers was abandoned. Following this attack, the Germans heavily refortified the area and were expecting further attacks. The battle, part of a larger offensive known as the Battle of Aubers Ridge, commenced on 9 May. The Kensingtons formed part of 25th Brigade, and were one of the lead infantry units in the northern pincer of the attack, targeting Fromelles.WO/95/1730 1/398, pp. 84‚Äì90.WO/95/1730 1/399, p. 22. Lee was part of D Company, which along with C Company led the Kensingtons during the assault. During the attack, the initial objectives were achieved, but at heavy cost. However, the attacking forces soon ran out of ammunition and retreated the following morning. Of the 550 men that the Kensingtons had engaged, there were 499 casualties, including 13 officers;WO/95/1730 1/398, p. 121.WO/95/1730 1/399, p. 27. in total the British casualties numbered over 11,000 men.WO/95/1730 1/399, p. 26. During the attack Lee was shot in the leg; a bullet hit his left thigh and fractured his femur.WO/161/98 6/2, pp. 2‚Äì3. He lay for three days between the lines having been given up for dead. A memorial service was held after the announcement of his death. After three days, Lee was found by the Germans and transported to hospital in Valenciennes. The ten-hour journey was initially made in the passenger compartment of a train, with sacks of straw, before he transferred to a Red Cross train at Lille. For the first week he was looked after by the French Red Cross, before the Germans took over. He remained in Valenciennes for six weeks, and remained bedridden for the duration of his stay. After this time, he was transferred to a second hospital in Hannover. For the first half of the two-day journey, Lee had to lie on a wooden seat with a blanket under him and his leg in an iron case, which hurt his back significantly, and was provided with no food. The second half of the journey was completed on a Red Cross train. During his stay in Hannover, Lee began to heal quickly, but after receiving advice from a fellow prisoner, he greatly exaggerated the injury, and was selected to be returned to England.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 42‚Äì43. He began the journey on 1 October 1915, and boarded the boat for England five days later. Although Lee had amplified the severity of his injury, in England he discovered that one of his legs would be permanently shorter than the other, and he had suffered significant muscle death. He was told that he would neither be able to fight nor play cricket again. He was discharged from the army on 4 December 1915, and was eligible for the Silver War Badge to show that he had served honourably. He later also received the 1914-15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal. After leaving the army, Middlesex paid for Lee to be treated by a specialist, and he was able to play a match for the Army Service Corps against Lancing College in early 1916, in which he scored a century. =Coaching in India= Lee narrowly avoided two U-Boat attacks during his journey to India. Having been invalided out of the Army, Lee worked as a filing clerk in the War Office, a position which allowed him plenty of time to play cricket with the MCC and in other wartime matches. Towards the end of the summer in 1916, he met Frank Tarrant's wife, who suggested that Lee should accompany her husband to work in India. He readily accepted, but before he was able to leave, his mother died and Lee felt that he should remain at home to look after his two young brothers. A year later, with the household settled, Lee took Tarrant up on the offer. He was originally booked on the Nyanza, which was sailing to Bombay, but was transferred to the Nagoya at the last minute, which sailed directly to Lee's final destination of Calcutta.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 44‚Äì46. The Nyanza was torpedoed out of Plymouth, and though it returned to port, 49 lives were lost.CAB/24/59 15/0015, p. 61. During the Nagoya's journey, the convoy of which it was part was attacked passing through the Mediterranean Sea by the German U-boat . One of the ships, the City of Lucknow, an 8,000 ton cargo steamer in the convoy, was sunk. The rest of the journey was completed without incident, despite a rumour that the Emden, a German light cruiser, lay in wait for the convoy. In India, Lee worked as a football and cricket coach for the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, but was treated more like a guest than a paid retainer.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 46. He played a few first-class matches during his time in India, and in his first match in the country, for the Maharaja's XI against Lord Willingdon's XI, Lee claimed his maiden five-wicket haul, taking five wickets and conceding eleven runs. He added another three wickets in the second innings to record the best bowling analysis of the match. In November 1918, Lee played for England against India. The Indian team did not have Test status, which was not attained until 1932,Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 367. but they had a strong team, and dominated the match against an England side which was far from representative.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 50‚Äì51. Lee claimed four wickets in the match for the concession of 177 runs, and made scores of eight and nine with the bat. Lee's highest score, and only century in first-class cricket in India was made in a match he was playing against the Maharaja of Cooch Behar's team. Appearing instead for MC Bird's XI, Lee opened the batting and scored 104 runs. He also claimed seven wickets in the match, which his side won by an innings. Return to county cricket Despite the injury he sustained during the war, when county cricket resumed in 1919, Lee took his leave of the Maharaja and returned to England to resume his career with Middlesex. County Championship matches were played over two days, an experiment which was unpopular with Lee, who described it as a \\"nightmare season\\".Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 52. Even with these shorter matches, Lee passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the first time in his career, and won himself a regular place in the Middlesex side. Originally from He scored four centuries during the season, including one in each innings of a charity match played against Surrey at The Oval. During the first innings, he reached 163, sharing a second wicket partnership of 226 with Jack Hearne, and in the second he scored 126. His batting average for the season was 40.76; the first of only three times that it would exceed 40 during his career. The championship reverted to three-day matches for 1920, and Lee enjoyed his greatest successes as a batsman during the season. He scored centuries in successive matches in mid-May, reaching 102 against Warwickshire at Lord's, and then 119 against Sussex at the same venue. Against Sussex, each of Middlesex's top four batsmen scored centuries; in addition to Lee's 119 runs, Pelham Warner scored 139, Nigel Haig 131, and Hearne remained 116 not out when the side declared. This was the first time the feat had been achieved in first-class cricket.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 54‚Äì55. Lee also took eleven wickets in the match, taking five in the first innings and six in the second to complete his maiden ten-wicket haul. In doing so, he became one of only eight Middlesex cricketers to have taken ten wickets in the same match as scoring a century. Playing against Hampshire at Southampton the following month, Lee scored his first double century, being 221 not out when Middlesex declared. He was also not out in the second innings, meaning that he was on the pitch for the full duration of the match. In total, Lee scored 1,518 runs at an average of 43.37 in first-class matches in 1920. He ranked third amongst Middlesex batsmen‚Äîby both runs scored and batting average‚Äîin the County Championship, which the county won narrowly, completing victory in the final session of their final match.Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 386. In A History of Cricket, H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton praise Lee's \\"all-round excellence\\" during the season: in addition to his runs, he claimed 40 wickets in the Championship at an average of 22.40. alt=A cricket pavilionLee's performances put him in contention for a place on the English touring party to travel to Australia that winter, but he eventually missed out on selection. Instead, he travelled to South Africa for the first of many winters playing and coaching in the country, accepting an invitation from the Wanderers Club in Johannesburg.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp.87‚Äì88. For the second consecutive season, Lee scored in excess of 1,500 runs in all first-class matches in 1921, aided by his highest career score; 243 not out against Nottinghamshire. Lee batted for over six hours to reach the score in a match which Middlesex won by an innings. He only scored one other century during the season, 121 runs against Sussex, but passed 50 on nine occasions. However, he enjoyed his best season as a bowler, claiming 72 first-class wickets at an average of 19.66, the best of his career.When bowling over 300 deliveries. Middlesex won the County Championship once more, and Lee finished third in both the batting and bowling tables, behind Hearne and Hendren amongst the batsmen, and Jack Durston and Haig, the bowlers. After the season, he travelled once more to South Africa, this time to coach at both St. Andrew's School and Grey College in Bloemfontein.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp.92. His obituary in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack states that by the end of 1921 his best years were over. Lee was certainly less prolific over the following few years: he averaged under 25 with the bat in each of the years from 1923 to 1925, and only passed 1,000 first-class runs in the first of the three. For the second time in his career, Lee was part of a batting line-up in which each of the top four batsmen scored a century: against Hampshire in Southampton, Lee scored 107, fellow opener Hugh Dales got 103, Hearne reached 232 and Hendren remained 177 not out as Middlesex declared with 642 runs. In 1923, he recorded his best bowling performance, taking eight wickets for the concession of 39 runs in the first innings against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham. He took a further four wickets in the second innings to help Middlesex to an eight wicket victory. He claimed 50 wickets for the third and final time that season, in which he was utilised heavily, being Middlesex's third most used bowler. He did not travel to South Africa in either of 1923‚Äì24 or 1924‚Äì25, a fact which he describes as the \\"cause and effect\\" of his poor form in 1924 and 1925. He travelled to South Africa again in 1926, spending the first of three successive winters in Cape Town, coaching at South African College Schools.Lee & Thompson (1948), p. 93‚Äì94. This coincided with a revival in his county cricket batting form; in 1926 he passed 1,000 runs after missing out on the total for two years. Heading toward the twilight of his career, Lee enjoyed a batting renaissance in 1928 and 1929. He averaged over 35 in each season, and scored runs heavily, reaching 1,715 runs in the first year and 1,995 in the second, the most in any season of his career. For the only time in his career, Lee was selected in 1928 to play for the professional \\"Players\\" team in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture. Appearing in the contest at The Oval in early June, he opened the batting and scored 56 runs. The match finished as a draw with the final day lost to rain. In 1929, he scored a century in each innings of a match for the second time, making 124 and 105 not out against a strong Lancashire bowling attack. Later that season, he scored his third and final double century, scoring 225 runs against Surrey at The Oval, during which he shared a second wicket partnership of 319 with Gubby Allen. Lee's 1,617 runs for Middlesex in the County Championship in 1929 made him their leading run- scorer, although both Hearne and Hendren topped 1,000 runs with superior averages. The following season saw Lee accumulate 1,485 first-class runs at an average of 26.05, in the season which saw him play more matches than in any other: 34 in total. He reached a century only once, scoring 150 runs against Somerset at Taunton. Solitary Test For the English winter of 1930‚Äì31, Lee took on positions at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 94‚Äì95. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries and illness. No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested that Lee be excused from his coaching duties to join up with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, he made his first appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores in the forties, but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he had no need to apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation came in the form of an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him. Later career Though now into his forties, Lee remained a regular in the Middlesex side in the early 1930s, and in 1931 he scored 1,291 runs at an average of 30.02, including two centuries. Both of his brothers, Jack and Frank, also scored a first-class century during the season, Jack scored 113 for Somerset against Northamptonshire, and Frank carried his bat to remain 134 not out for Somerset against Sussex. The feat was the first instance of three professional brothers all scoring first-class centuries in the same season. Two years later, all three brothers were involved in a dismissal: Harry Lee was caught for 82 runs by Frank from the bowling of Jack. Though Lee passed 1,000 first-class runs in each of 1932 and 1933, he did so with averages under 25, and in 1934 he was dropped from the Middlesex side in order to encourage some younger players to break into the team. He continued to appear for the MCC during the season, and scored a century against Cambridge University in early July. He was briefly recalled to the Middlesex team in August, and recorded a final century, reaching 119 against Warwickshire. Although he was successful in the subsequent match against Surrey, making scores of 65 and 38 not out, Middlesex terminated his contract at the end of the season, much to his disappointment. In 437 first-class appearances, Lee scored a total of 20,158 runs at an average of 29.95. He scored 38 centuries and passed 1,000 runs in a season on 13 occasions. Upon the completion of his playing career, Lee began umpiring almost straight away, standing in non-first-class MCC matches. He petitioned Middlesex to be put forward for first-class duties for the following season, which they duly did. He was approved by the county captains, and umpired first-class cricket from 1935 until 1946.Lee & Thompson (1948), pp. 175‚Äì176. He then returned to coaching, taking on a position at Downside School in Somerset from 1949 until 1953. He was a regular attendee at Lord's throughout the remainder of his life, and by the time of his death in 1981, he was England's second oldest Test cricketer. Playing style In his own words, Lee was not a \\"brilliant youngster like Jack Hearne or Denis Compton, but an ordinary, average county cricketer\\". Despite this assertion, Lee's 18,594 first-class runs for Middlesex rank him eleventh in their all-time list, and he is one of only seventeen cricketers to have scored over 5,000 runs and taken over 300 wickets for the county. H. S. Altham and E. W. Swanton suggested that figures alone do show his true worth, as at the time the Lord's pitch did not favour batsmen, and had he played his career on \\"some other ground where the pitch was a batsman's paradise, his figures would have borne a truer relation to his value.\\"Altham & Swanton (1938), p. 388. Lee batted with a noticeable crouch, and scored predominantly on the leg side. His style was unattractive to watch, but effective, and although Hearne and Hendren drew most of the plaudits for their more colourful methods, Lee received praise for his toughness and courage.

Gioia (born April 27, 1973) is a New York City politician of the Democratic Party. He served for eight years as a member of the New York City Council. He was elected to two year terms in 2001 and 2003 and to a four-year term in 2005, representing the Queens neighborhoods of Woodside, Sunnyside, Maspeth, and Long Island City. Early life and career Gioia attended PS11 Queens, a public elementary school. He worked in his family's florist shop in Woodside, Queens, which has been in operation for more than a century. He attended St. Francis Preparatory School, New York University and Georgetown University Law Center. He worked his way through NYU as a janitor/elevator operator, and member of Service Employees International Union/SEIU-Local 32BJ. He worked as a law clerk in the White House under President Bill Clinton. He worked in private practice in Manhattan at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, and later on Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000. City Council On the City Council, Gioia advocated for the poor, and wrote laws to help alleviate child hunger and to protect the environment. He served as Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Committee of the New York City Council, in which capacity he conducted over 50 investigations, leading to the passage of laws which protect homeless people with HIV and AIDS, ensure the availability of emergency contraception, increase government accountability and transparency, and encourage voter registration among young people. He was particularly active in expanding opportunity for the residents of public housing. He founded a youth baseball and basketball league and brought a bank to Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City where previously the closest bank was over a mile away. He led a campaign to get more New Yorkers to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), and passed legislation strengthening the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights. In September 2007, he was named one of City Hall's \\"40 under 40\\" for being a young influential member of New York City politics.Rising Stars 40 Under 40: Eric Gioia , City & State, September 17, 2007. Gioia has been mentioned as a possible candidate for New York's 14th congressional district. =Food Stamp Challenge= In 2007, Gioia voluntarily chose to live on $28 for one week, in order to bring attention to the daily struggle of millions of New Yorkers. He stated, \\"But as tough as this week has been for me, the sad fact is that it was nothing compared with what over 1.1 million New Yorkers face every day. Far too many New Yorkers make impossible choices among health care for their children, paying their rent or putting food on the table on a daily basis.\\" Gioia introduced legislation to make access to food stamps easier, including putting applications online, and successfully pushed retailer Costco to accept food stamps at two of its New York locations. This has led many to consider Eric Gioia to be a hero in the communities he services. In a major victory for hunger advocates, Costco recently announced that after successfully accepting food stamps in New York City, it will begin accepting food stamps at all locations nationwide. =Con Edison= In 2006, an extended blackout affected large portions of Gioia's district. Con Edison's slow response and misleading information about the extent of the blackout led Gioia to criticize the company and its CEO, Kevin Burke. After power was fully restored nine days later, Gioia continued to scrutinize the company's safety record. The 2006 blackout was followed by a steam pipe explosion in 2007 and two fatal gas explosions in Queens in 2007 and 2009. Gioia also criticized the utility company's rate hikes when it continued to pay high dividends to its investors. To improve efficiency, Gioia lobbied Con Ed to implement a smart grid, commenting that \\"new digital technology - called Smart Meters - has allowed customers elsewhere to cut their bills by 10%, but here in New York, Con Ed continues to rely on 19th century technology to power a 21st century city.\\" In August 2009, Con Ed launched a pilot smart grid project in Gioia's district in Western Queens. =Council investigation into FDNY radio problems= Fire Department of New York radios failed in the Twin Towers during the rescue operations immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Council member Gioia introduced a measure to have the Council investigate the issue of FDNY radio problems. \\"I will do everything in my power to get answers, to get the truth ... [T]hese families deserve answers and really the entire city and our country deserve answers\\", Gioia stated. He introduced the investigation resolution following a petition drive to have the Council investigate the radios issue. The petitions carried 20,000 signatures. Petition organizers congratulated Gioia on his sponsorship of the investigation proposal. Public Advocate campaign Having reaffirmed his opposition to extending term limits, and having publicly ruled out seeking re-election in 2009 Gioia ran to become the next New York City Public Advocate. Gioia was endorsed in the primary by the New York Daily News. Gioia raised more money than any of his opponents but finished third with only 18.40% of the vote, behind Mark Green and Bill de Blasio. He was succeeded in the City Council by James Van Bramer. After leaving the City Council, Gioia accepted a position as Vice President of J.P Morgan Chase's private bank. He remains active in the community and serves on the board of several New York non-profits.

He scored 1,000 runs in his first full first-class season and missed out on that feat only once in his career. In 1934, he scored 2,261 runs at an average of 48 runs per innings, the only time he passed 2,000 runs in a season. His one poor season, 1938, led to him not being re-engaged by Hampshire, but the county had second thoughts and he returned for the 1939 season and for five more seasons after the Second World War. He fell ill during the 1950 season, and retired without playing again. He was a first-class umpire for 14 seasons from 1961. Arnold played only one Test match: with Fred Bakewell, he formed an experimental opening partnership for England against New Zealand at Lord's in 1931, following the retirement from Test cricket of Jack Hobbs and injury to Herbert Sutcliffe. The move was not a success. Arnold was out for 0 in the first innings, and though he scored 34 in the second, he was replaced by the returning Sutcliffe for the second Test. He did not play Test cricket again.

The Fort Totten Metro Station is also within walking distance from other areas of Brightwood. There are several Metrobus routes that serve the community. Brightwood is at an elevation of .  History  = Crystal Springs = The land was part of a land patent called White Mill Seat in 1756. The name was changed to Peter's Mill Seat in 1800. Later, the area was called Crystal Springs, named after the pure water that flowed from several nearby springs. One of the springs was located near the modern- day intersection of Fourteenth and Kennedy streets, which still flows in the present day, creating a constant stream of water on the sidewalk of the western side of Fourteenth Street, across from the Metrobus building. The area had many chestnut trees, and it was considered a place to enjoy with family. The Passenger Railroad Company ran hourly stagecoaches from Fourteenth Street and Boundary Avenue to the springs, charging 25 cents per ride. The area was later known as Brighton, but residents decided to change the name to Brightwood because the postal service frequently confused it with Brighton, Maryland. Archibald White and Louis Brunett are generally given credit for coming up with the name Brightwood. The area has been known as Brightwood since the 1840s. =Emory United Methodist Church= Emory United Methodist Church Emory M.E. Church was built in 1832, when A.G. Pierce donated a half- acre of land in order to build a church and a school. The original building stood two stories high. The first floor, made of logs, was used as a school. The second story, which was made of frame and used for worship, had a separate entrance from the outside. Colored worshippers sat in a gallery. The church was named after John Emory of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, who was ordained bishop in 1832, the same year as the building of the church. Bishop Emory also paid the $200 salary of the preacher's salary. In 1856, the 72-person congregation of desired a larger church, and the church building was replaced by a red-brick structure in 1856. A stone church stood from 1870 to 1921, when the present-day building was built. The churchyard was originally used as a cemetery, a customary use of such land in those days. Some of the deceased were later moved to Rock Creek Cemetery. ) From the late 1970s to 1992 Emory membership sharply declined the church was sold on almost two occasions. In 1992 Joseph W. Daniels, Jr. came to Emory as a DS hire to serve as its part- time pastor at Emory. Membership is 85 with an average worship size of 55 people. During his leadership at Emory, the congregation has grown from an average of 55 people in weekly worship attendance to over 400 every Sunday. Emory seeks to be a ‚ÄúReal Church for Real People‚Äù and has been acknowledged numerous times for its role in changing lives and changing communities. The church has been awarded the ‚ÄúKim Jefferson Northeast Jurisdictional Award‚Äù for effective urban ministry representing the United Methodist Church and has been selected as one of the 25 Congregational Resource Centers in the ‚ÄúStrengthening the Black Church for the 21st Century‚Äù effort of the United Methodist Church. In the mid-2000s, the Rev. Joseph W. Daniels, Jr. laid out his vision for not only a new church for Emory, but also a building that would surround it and serve as community space and residences. In 2009, the church started on the winding regulatory path for the project, which included getting approval from the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment. = Fort Stevens = Fort Stevens recreation Brightwood is also home to Fort Stevens. During the Civil War, the Union military decided to build a fortification on the site of Emory Church. The church was torn down, and the bricks were used to build Fort Stevens and baking ovens. A nearby log building used by the church was also torn down and used to build a guardhouse for unruly soldiers. Fort Stevens was attacked by 20,000 Confederate soldiers led by General Jubal Early during the Battle of Fort Stevens, July 11‚Äì12, 1864. The Confederate attack was repulsed. The congregation petitioned Congress for compensation for the torn-down church, Congress appropriated $412 for rent for use of the grounds. Following petitions from veterans formerly stationed at the fort, Congress established a park at the site and a memorial plaque. Forty soldiers are buried in the nearby historic Battleground National Cemetery. An 1885 police census documented the population of Brightwood as 104. = Brightwood Trotting Park = Brightwood was home to a horse racetrack originally named Crystal Springs Park, then Piney Branch Park, and finally Brightwood Trotting Park. A tavern was nearby, operated by Frederick G. Rohr and later by his widow Annie M. Rohr. It was common for people to watch the races, swim in nearby Rock Creek, and have a picnic lunch. After many years, Brightwood Trotting Park greatly decreased in popularity. During its last year of operation, it was primarily used for racing mules. The course was closed in 1909 in order to make way for the extension of Sixteenth Street. = Other historic sites = Moreland's Tavern sat at the corner of modern-day Georgia and Missouri avenues before the Civil War. The building later became the Brightwood Club House, known for being a nice place to ride a horse and enjoy a drink. It eventually became the site of a Masonic Temple. Brightwood was also the location of the first successful flight by a helicopter in the United States in 1909. The Sheridan Theater, a motion-picture theater, opened on Georgia Avenue between Rittenhouse and Sheridan Streets in 1937. The first feature was Sing Me A Love Song. Other historic sites include Engine Company 22 on Georgia Avenue NW, Fort View Apartments, which overlook the site of Fort Stevens and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Military Road School, which opened in 1864 and was one of the first schools in Washington to open after Congress authorized the education of African Americans.

Hicks"},{"id":"3663656","text":"Saturation pollination is a pollination technique for agricultural crops in areas dominated by non-crop plant species that are preferred by pollinators. The technique involves keeping a larger number of bee colonies than normally maintained for honey production so as to exhaust the preferred plants and ensure visitation of the crop plants by the bees.McGregor, S.E. 1976. Insect Pollination Of Cultivated Crop Plants. USDA The technique is applied in areas that are normally avoided by beekeepers because of poor honey yields. Saturation pollination is especially important for those with special pollination problems, such as crops with flowers that are unattractive to Western honey bees (kiwifruit, for example), that have nectar that is low in sugars, or crops that have been moved from their native areas without the corresponding movement of their normal pollinators. The keel of alfalfa flowers knock young honey bees on the head when they attempt to take the nectar and the bees soon learn to come in from the side to avoid getting hit with the keel's pollen bearing structure while still getting the nectar. Thus only young, inexperienced bees are doused with pollen and able to pollinate alfalfa. Saturation pollination is becoming increasingly required for many crops due to decline of wild pollinators and monocultured crops. History of the technique The concept was developed by commercial California beekeeper Harry J. Whitcombe and University of California entomologist George H. Vansell in conjunction with alfalfa seed production.Whitcombe, Harry J. and John Scott Douglas, 1955 Bees are My Business. G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York. Though fruit growers and beekeepers were well acquainted with the vital role of Western honey bees in pollinating fruit blossoms, the role of these bees in alfalfa seed production was poorly understood. In the 1920s California beekeepers began migrating into Utah during the alfalfa bloom; at that time Utah being the largest alfalfa seed producing state in the US. When alfalfa first comes into bloom the flowers are bluish-purple and the fields have a bright cast. As the blossoms are pollinated the flowers fade and take on a grayish cast, making the field appear dull colored. Utah farmers were convinced that the bees were somehow damaging the blossoms, and persuaded the state legislature in 1930 to enact an embargo against bees entering the state from other states. Alfalfa seed yields from the fields declined so precipitously that the farmers were going bankrupt. The error was realized and the embargo rescinded in 1934; however Utah had forever lost its pre-eminent position as an alfalfa seed growing state, and California took the lead. After World War II, demand for alfalfa seed reached an all-time high. Normally alfalfa is planted in rotation with other crops, because, as a legume, it replenishes nitrogen in the soil. However, wartime needs had caused many alfalfa fields to be converted to vegetables and other crops thought to be more necessary to the war effort. Now, the farmers were trying to repair the damage done to soils by replanting alfalfa. While the demand was the highest in history, seed production was steadily declining. Increasing pesticide use and the increased utilization of fallow land and hedgerows was depleting wild pollinators to near the vanishing point. California beekeepers produced a high quality honey from alfalfa, and were willing to move bees to the alfalfa seed fields at a rate of one and a half hives per acre. Experience had shown this the maximum rate at which bees could be stocked without damaging the honey yield per hive. Vansell and Whitcombe had become convinced by their observations that the optimum rate for honey production for beekeepers was not sufficient for optimum pollination and seed production. Whitcombe notes that he always observed the heaviest seed set in the plants that were nearest the stands of bees. Vansell was finally able to convince Luther G Jones, the alfalfa seed specialist at the agricultural college at Davis, that further experiments in this area would be profitable. The plan was to stock some test fields at four to six hives per acre and see if the yield responded. It was called saturation pollination. But beekeepers were not willing to stock hives at a more concentrated rate, because they would lose money. At the same time, even though fruit growers had long been accustomed to paying pollination fees, no alfalfa seed grower was willing to pay for pollination service. In 1948 the three were able to find a grower who was willing to risk a contingent deal. Stan Good, of Woodland, California, was a progressive farmer who was willing to experiment. But he would not risk any money. The deal was that Good would raise of alfalfa for seed production, using the best cultivation techniques known, and Whitcombe would supply the bees at the rate of five hives per acre, again using the best management practices. For every pound of alfalfa seed produced above the rate of 400 pounds per acre (which was well above the area's normal average), Whitcombe would receive one cent per hive. And for all seed produced above 750 pounds per acre, one third of the seed would belong to the beekeeper. The result was that the plants set so heavy a seed crop that they could not support the seed head. True to his word, Good began irrigating, a practice not normally done, so that the plants would continue to grow and strengthen to support the seed heads. The plants began to grow again and put out more bloom, which promptly set more seed. At harvest time, the results of the experiment were so phenomenal that it almost ruined the experiment. The crop yield was so heavy that the harvesting equipment choked up and broke down. It had to be reworked by the agricultural mechanics at Davis to give heavier bearings and increased capacity. With seasonal rains threatening the crop was finished just in time to be measured. The total yield was almost 1000 pounds to the acre - well above the 220 average California yield at that time. Both beekeeper and farmer were rewarded handsomely by the results. The word spread quickly and in four seasons California tripled its alfalfa seed production. The saturation pollination technique was also applied to ladino and alsike clover seed production with corresponding increases. With California running three times the national average per acre for forage legume seeds, other states began to pick up California's techniques. By the 1970s and 1980s large scale saturation pollination had become the norm in US agriculture for many more crops which require bee pollination. A supplement or alternative to honeybees Today, research is ongoing in the use of an alternative pollinator, the alfalfa leafcutter bee for alfalfa seed pollination.

In the aftermath of the coup, the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC) became the country's supreme organ. The NCRC was dominated by the Syrian branch of the radical, pan-Arab Ba'ath Party. Al-Hafiz became President, instituted socialist reforms, and oriented his country towards the Eastern Bloc. =Downfall= On 23 February 1966, al-Hafiz was overthrown by a radical Ba'athist faction headed by Chief of Staff Salah Jadid. A late warning telegram of the coup d'√©tat was sent from Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser to Nasim al- Safarjalani (The General Secretary of Presidential Council), on the early morning of the coup d'√©tat. The coup sprung out of factional rivalry between Jadid's \\"regionalist\\" (qutri) camp of the Ba'ath Party, which promoted ambitions for a Greater Syria, and the more traditionally pan-Arab al-Hafiz faction, called the \\"nationalist\\" (qawmi) faction. Jadid's supporters were also seen as more radically left-wing. The coup was also supported and led by officers from Syria's religious minorities, especially the Alawites and the Druze, whereas al-Hafiz belonged to the majority Sunni population. Exile and return After being wounded in the three-hour shootout that preceded the coup, in which two of his children were seriously injured, al-Hafiz was jailed in Damascus's Mezzeh prison before being sent to Lebanon in June 1967. A year later, he was relocated to Baghdad. In 1971, the courts of Damascus sentenced him to death in absentia; however, Saddam Hussein \\"treated him and his fellow exile, Ba'ath founder Michel Aflaq, like royalty\\", and the sentence was not carried out.

The law proposes that conjugacy of saccades is due to innate connections in which the eye muscles responsible for each eye's movements are innervated equally. The law also states that apparent monocular eye movements are actually the summation of conjugate version and disjunctive (or vergence) eye movements. The law was put forward by Ewald Hering in the 19th century, though the underlying principles of the law date back considerably. Aristotle had commented upon this phenomenon and Ptolemy put forward a theory of why such a physiological law might be useful. It was clearly stated for the first time by Alhacen in his Book of Optics (1021). Depiction of predictions for refoveating Muller's stimulus with eyes moving independently or eyes following Hering's law of equal innervation. Hering's law of equal innervation is best understood with M√ºller's stimulus where an observer refoveates a point that moved in one eye only. The least-effort way to refoveate is to move the misaligned eye only. Instead Hering's law predicts that because both eyes must move by equal amounts, a combination of conjunctive and disjunctive eye movements is required to refoveate the target point. Yarbus showed experimentally that binocular eyes movements are indeed composed mostly of combinations of saccades and vergence. However it is now known that clear deviations from Hering's law also occur This theory is in contrast to the theory proposed by Von Helmholtz which states that conjugacy is a learned, coordinated response and that the movements of the eyes are individually controlled. Helmholtz's point of view is today often caricatured as a chameleon-like, independent, control of the eyes although Helmholtz never defended that theory. Their disagreement concerned the innate vs. learned aspect of binocularly coordinated eye movements. Helmholtz's arguments were mainly related to Listing's law and can be simplified as the fact that there exist positions of the eyes where muscles will have different effects on the two eyes. Thus Hering's law, in its original formulation, simply cannot be correct as it would lead to situations where the eyes would move by different amounts, something on which both agreed never happens. Hering subsequently modified his law to state that the eyes behave as if they received equal innervation. The extent to which Hering's law is correct, or not, remains in debate today as the exact physiological underpinning of vergence eye movements remain to be found.

After his promotion to commander in 1902, he was executive officer on and . =Russo-Japanese War= During the Russo-Japanese War, Sat≈ç served as a staff officer of the IJN 2nd Fleet under Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj≈ç, partly to protect him from political retaliation by the Imperial Japanese Army, who were incensed by his thesis that the navy was of more importance. While aboard the 2nd Fleet flagship Izumo, Sato took part in the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima. Following the war, Sat≈ç was executive officer on the battleship , and was then given his first command: the gunboat ; however, he returned within a year to the Naval War College as an advanced student, and later served as an instructor from 1906 to 1908. =Naval theorist= After winning promotion to captain in 1907, Sat≈ç published several revised editions and expanded on his initial 1903 thesis including History of Naval Defense (1907), History of the Empire's Defense (1908), and the Revised History of the Empire's Defense (1912). Sat≈ç has been called \\"the Mahan of Japan\\", as his writings emphasized that the key to Japan's safety was denial of power projection by hypothetical enemies (such as the United States), into waters adjacent to the Japanese home islands. Sat≈ç's works, along with documents of the Navy Ministry regarding policy, would form the basis of the Japanese naval expansion into the Netherlands East Indies, using elements from naval plans developed by United States Navy Admiral Alfred T. Mahan and Royal Navy Vice Admiral Philip Howard Colomb. He also began urging the Japanese government to maintain at least a 70% capital ship level over the United States, Japan's hypothetical rival. Sat≈ç was promoted to rear admiral in 1912, while at the Navy War College, as well as serving at sea between 1908 until 1914 as captain of the and . The following year after Japan's entry into World War I, Sat≈ç was appointed Vice Chief of the Navy General Staff in 1915, and promoted to vice admiral the next year while serving as president of the Navy War College. Leaving the Navy War College in 1920, Sat≈ç commanded the Maizuru Naval District before being placed on the inactive list in 1922. In November 1928, he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure (1st class). Named to the House of Peers in 1934, Sat≈ç was a major opponent to Japan's participation in the Washington Naval Treaty (and thus a member of the Fleet Faction following World War I until his death in 1942.)

It is hypothesized that a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of the Tadpole Galaxy--from left to right from the perspective of Earth--and was slung around behind the Tadpole by their mutual gravitational attraction. During this close encounter, tidal forces drew out the spiral galaxy's stars, gas, and dust, forming the conspicuous tail. The intruder galaxy itself, estimated to lie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole, can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper left. Following its terrestrial namesake, the Tadpole Galaxy will likely lose its tail as it grows older, the tail's star clusters forming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.

Boulder Glacier is the sixth largest on Mount Baker with an area of . It flows from the summit crater between Grant Peak () and Sherman Peak () to about . It is noteworthy for retreating between 1987 and 2008, leaving newly exposed rock and soil behind. Between 1850 and 1950, the glacier retreated . William Long of the United States Forest Service observed the glacier beginning to advance due to cooler and wetter weather in 1953. This was followed by a advance by 1979. The 1979 terminus position is where the small stream enters Boulder Creek from the southwest. Observations in 2005 suggest that the lowest thousand feet or several hundred meters of the glacier is stagnant and will likely disappear. In the pictures, this section of the glacier is gray with rock debris and has few crevasses. On the west side of Boulder Creek is a small waterfall revealed by the recent recession of the glacier. Stagnant, rock-debris-covered glacier terminus in 2004 Boulder Glacier may be approached via the Boulder Ridge Trail number 605. The trail passes through a climax community of pacific silver fir and related species of disparate ages with many standing snags. In the fall, a large variety of mushroom species emerge. Near elevation, the trail ascends a lateral glacial moraine. At the route ascends about of Class 2 rock and of steep subalpine forest to reach the ridge crest. Soon thereafter, the trail disappears. Boulder Ridge consists of scenic heather-covered benches and a number of lateral moraines left by vanished glaciers. Glacial retreat has left the upper portion of the ridge barren and unstable and rockfall from the terminus of that portion of the glacier is a hazard to the unwary visitor. Boulder Glacier is one of the more popular climbing routes on Mount Baker. First climbed on August 24, 1891, it is most often ascended in combination with the cleaver between Boulder and Park Glacier to the north to bypass densely crevassed sections of the glacier. At about elevation, the route passes to the southwest of steep rock and ice to reach the summit ridge east of Grant Peak.

C. & Martin, J. (1989). \\"A revision of the > Testudines of North Africa, Asia, and Europe. Genus: Testudo\\". Journal of > Chelonian Herpetology. 1 (1): 1‚Äì12. Since then, DNA sequence data have increasingly been used in systematics, but in Testudines (turtles and tortoises), its usefulness is limited: In some of these, at least mtDNA is known to evolve more slowly in these than in most other animals. Paleobiogeographical considerations suggest the rate of evolution of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene is 1.0-1.6% per million years for the last dozen million years or so in the present genus and ntDNA evolution rate has been shown to vary strongly even between different population of T. hermanni; this restricts sequence choice for molecular systematics and makes the use of molecular clocks questionable. The following extant species are placed here: * Russian tortoise or Horsfield's tortoise, T. horsfieldii * Hermann's tortoise, T. hermanni ** Subspecies: *** Eastern Hermann's tortoise, T. hermanni boettgeri *** Western Hermann's tortoise, T. hermanni hermanni * Spur-thighed tortoise, Greek tortoise or common tortoise, T. graeca ** Subspecies: *** Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise, T. graeca graeca *** Araxes tortoise, T. graeca armeniaca *** Buxton's tortoise, T. graeca buxtoni *** Cyrenaican spur-thighed tortoise, T. graeca cyrenaica *** Asia Minor tortoise, T. graeca ibera *** Morocco tortoise, T. graeca marokkensis *** Nabeul tortoise, T. graeca nabeulensis *** Souss Valley tortoise, T. graeca soussensis *** Mesopotamian tortoise, T. graeca terrestris *** Iranian tortoise, T. graeca zarudnyi * Egyptian tortoise or Kleinmann's tortoise, T. kleinmanni * Marginated tortoise, T. marginata The first two are more distinct and ancient lineages than the closely related latter three species. Arguably, T. horsfieldii belongs in a new genus (Agrionemys) on the basis of the shape of its carapace and plastron,Khozatsky, L.I. & Mlynarski, M. (1966): Agrionemys - nouveau genre de tortues terrestres (Testudinidae) [\\"Agrionemys - a new genus of tortoises\\"]. [Article in French] Bulletin de l'Acad√©mie Polonaise des Sciences II - S√©rie des Sciences Biologiques 2: 123-125. and its distinctness is supported by DNA sequence analysis. Likewise, a separate genus Eurotestudo has recently been proposed for T. hermanni; these three lineages were distinct by the Late Miocene as evidenced by the fossil record. Whether these splits will eventually be accepted remains to be seen. The genus Chersus has been proposed to unite the Egyptian and marginated tortoises which have certain DNA sequence similarities, but their ranges are (and apparently always were) separated by their closest relative T. graeca and the open sea and thus, chance convergent haplotype sorting would better explain the biogeographical discrepancy. Conversely, the Greek tortoise is widespread and highly diverse. In this and other species, a high number of subspecies has been described, but not all generally accepted, and several (such as the \\"Negev tortoise\\" and the \\"dwarf marginated tortoise\\") are now considered to be local morphs. Some, such as the Tunisian tortoise, have even been separated as a separate genus Furculachelys, but this is not supported by more recent studies.  Mating  Testudo spp. are promiscuous creatures and they follow a polyandrous mating system. Mating involves a courtship ritual of mechanical, olfactory and auditory displays elicited from the male to coerce a female into accepting copulation. Courtship displays are very energetically costly for males, especially because females tend to run away from courting males. The male will chase her, exerting more energy and elaborate displays of ramming and biting. Females are able to judge a male's genetic quality through these displays; only healthy males are able to perform costly courting rituals, suggesting endurance rivalry. These are considered honest signals that are then used to influence pre- and post-copulatory choice, as females are the choosy sex. Female mate choice offers no direct benefits (such as access to food or territory or parental care). There are, however, indirect benefits of mating with multiple males. Engaging in a polyandrous mating system offers a female guaranteed fertilization, higher offspring diversity and sperm competition to ensure that eggs are fertilized by a high quality male. This is in respect to the \\"good genes\\" hypothesis that females receive indirect benefits through her offspring by mating with a quality male, \\"a male's contribution to a female's fitness is restricted to [his] genes\\" (Cutuli, G. et al., 2014). Mating order has no influence on paternity of a clutch so a female's inclination to mate with multiple males and her ability to store sperm allows for sperm competition and suggests cryptic female choice. However, some species do show size-assortative, T. marginata, for example, where large males breed with large females and small males breed with small females. Other species form hierarchies; during male-to-male competition the more aggressive male is considered alpha. Alpha males are more aggressive with their courting as well and have higher mounting success rate than beta males. A female's reproductive tract contains sperm storage tubules and she is capable of storing sperm for up to four years. This sperm remains viable and when she goes a breeding season without encountering a male she is able to fertilize her eggs with the stored sperm. Storing sperm can also result in multiple paternity clutches; It is quite common among Testudo spp. females to lay a clutch that has been sired by multiple males. And females can lay one to four clutches a breeding season. Sexual dimorphism, promiscuity, long term sperm storage and elaborate courting rituals are factors that effect mate preference, sperm competition and cryptic female choice in genus Testudo.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (2001‚Äì2014) in Washington, D.C. Dubbed \\"the turnaround king\\" for his work at such arts institutions as the Kansas City Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, American Ballet Theatre, and the Royal Opera House, Kaiser has earned international renown for his expertise in arts management. Early life Born October 27, 1953, in New York City, Kaiser grew up in New Rochelle, New York, earning an undergraduate degree in economics and minor in music from Brandeis University, magna cum laude, and a masters degree in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management. His study of vocal music reflected an early passion for the arts, and while he hoped for a career as an opera singer he was, as he put it, \\"just dreadful\\".MIT World at mitworld.mit.edu: \\"Kaiser abandoned his dream of becoming a professional singer after realizing he was \\"just dreadful\\" . Career Kaiser's early career focused on strategic planning and management consulting. In 1981, he founded Kaiser Associates, a consulting firm whose clients included General Motors and IBM. But in 1985, spurred by his lifelong love of the arts, he sold his consulting firm to enter the world of arts management. =Transition to arts management= When he joined the Kansas City Ballet as general manager in 1985, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy. Within two years, Kaiser had revamped and energized the troupe's fundraising, and attracted critical attention and acclaim through ambitious programming initiatives. His leadership enabled the company to pay off the accumulated deficit, which had nearly led to its closure. Kaiser joined the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater as executive director in 1991. The company faced extreme challenges, stemming from a $1.5 million accumulated deficit. Kaiser developed a strategic plan with the company's board and staff, targeting fundraising and marketing as key areas for overhaul. Recognizing the company's broad, international appeal, Kaiser set about putting the dancers before a much larger audience. In December 1992, the company was featured on The Donahue Show, then the premiere daytime television program. In an unprecedented move, the full one-hour program was devoted to the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, an event viewed by 18 million Americans. In 1993, the company performed at President Bill Clinton's inaugural gala, which was broadcast to an audience of 88 million. During Kaiser's tenure as executive director, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater eliminated its deficit, increased the efficiency of its touring programs, and enhanced its national and international image.Todd Purdom, \\"An Impresario With a Sideline: Rescuing Troubled Cultural Groups\\", interview in The New York Times, December 9, 2004: 'For Dance Theater, he noted, the most acute problem ‚Äî $900,000 owed to \\"the people who can shut you down,\\" including insurers ‚Äî was \\"nothing, not even in the scheme of Harlem, let alone New York.\\" Within five or six weeks, Mr. Kaiser helped the company retire its debts, find a new executive director, expand its board and begin facing the future. \\"I needed to show troubled organizations around the country that you can fix your problems,\\" he said. \\"I take very little credit for the actual implementation. They've done it.\\" ' In 1995, Kaiser became executive director of American Ballet Theatre. With an accumulated deficit of $5.5 million, the company was struggling on the brink of closure. Ticket revenues were insufficient to meet the company's needs and the towering debt had reduced the board, management, and staff to a daily struggle to keep afloat, forestalling any strategic or long-range planning. Kaiser set about finding the large donations needed to reduce the $5.5 million deficit. He revamped the touring program, reaching out to cities across the United States as well as in Asia and Europe. He created new education programs to nurture both new dancers and new audiences. And he fueled aggressive new marketing programs, burnishing American Ballet Theatre's long-held reputation as a \\"company of stars.\\" Within three years, the company had eliminated the entire accumulated deficit and established a surplus. After his success at American Ballet Theatre, the Chicago Tribune coined the sobriquet \\"The Turnaround King\\" for Kaiser. In 1998, Kaiser assumed leadership of the Royal Opera House in London, home of the Royal Opera, London and the Royal Ballet. In the midst of a major renovation, faced with a projected $30 million deficit, and flailing in a firestorm of criticism from the public, its board, and its patrons, the Royal Opera House was facing the most severe crisis of its history. Despite press reports predicting, even welcoming, the demise of the organization, and vitriol from patrons, Kaiser set to work, negotiating with the unions, placating the creative staff of the two resident companies, guiding the new facility through its final construction and problematic technical and stagecraft operations, and beginning the delicate work of repairing the institution's reputation as he worked to erase its debt. Within two years, the deficit was paid off, the new building paid for and opened, and an endowment fund established to protect the security of the Royal Opera House's future.Tim Page, \\"Michael Kaiser: Impresario of the Year\\", Musical America, musicalamerica.com online, 2007: \\"...he cut ticket prices, erased a company deficit of $30 million, and completed raising the funds for a $360 million renovation.\\" =Kennedy Center= In 2001, Kaiser joined the Kennedy Center as president. Unlike the organizations which had established his reputation as a savior of companies on the brink of disaster, the Kennedy Center was financially stable and not in need of a turnaround. But Kaiser set the goal of enhancing the Center's status as the nation's center for the performing arts, a destination for both American and international arts lovers. His first undertaking was the \\"Sondheim Celebration\\", an unprecedented staging of six musicals by Stephen Sondheim, within one season, under one roof: Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Company, A Little Night Music, Sunday in the Park with George, Merrily We Roll Along, and Passion.Bruce B. Auster, page 2: \\"The good feeling can be traced largely to Kaiser's decision to produce six plays by Stephen Sondheim last year. This was no mean feat‚Äî\\"an impossible idea,\\" says Chapin‚Äîgiven that the Kennedy Center had become a tour stop, a place where not even one play originated, let alone six sell-outs at a time.\\" Critical response to the Sondheim Celebration was extraordinary, John Rockwell, \\"MUSIC; Sondheim Has His Shrine, and It's Not on Broadway\\", The New York Times, August 18, 2002: \\"In the meantime, when it comes to newly considered schemes to keep these masterpieces of American musical culture alive, Mr. Kaiser has shown the way\\" and the box office opened to record-breaking sales. Paul Harris, \\"WASHINGTON ‚Äî Credit the Kennedy Center for helping to revive D.C.'s moribund tourism economy, which has been in the tank since Sept. 11. Its festival of six musicals by Stephen Sondheim registered a one-day record for single ticket sales Feb. 11. The box office sold $639,000 in tickets that first day at a $76 top... At week's end, sales had topped $3.3 million, including $2 million in advance subscription and group sales....\\", Variety, February 2002. Two other theatrical achievements were a retrospective of Tennessee Williams' work and a highly acclaimed celebration of the ten plays of August Wilson presented in sequential order. Having set the bar high, Kaiser continued to upgrade the Kennedy Center's artistic profile, negotiating long-term agreements with the Mariinsky Opera and the Mariinsky Ballet, the Royal Shakespeare Company, New York City Ballet, and the Bolshoi Ballet that ensured their regular appearance at the Kennedy Center; producing major festivals of the arts including \\"The Festival of China\\", \\"JAPAN: culture+hyperculture,\\" and \\"Arabesque: Arts of the Arab World;\\" each bringing hundreds of international performers and artists to American audiences for the first time; and expanding the Kennedy Center's jazz and family programming. He has expanded educational programming, increasing the annual education budget to $25 million for programs reaching young people and adults‚Äîmore than any other arts institution. Long committed to teaching and education, Kaiser has made the Kennedy Center a university of sorts for arts organizations and arts managers by founding, in 2010, the Kennedy Center Arts Management Institute to provide advanced training for young arts administrators and developing a series of programs to help train others in the field. Bruce B. Auster, page 2:\\"This year 12 students from arts organizations around the world are studying to be arts managers. Each is writing a strategic plan for a minority arts organization that has teamed with the Kennedy Center, part of Kaiser's push to bring the performing arts to more communities.\\" The Institute transitioned to the University of Maryland in September 2014, as the DeVos Institute of Arts Management, based on a $22.5 million endowment from Dick and Betsy DeVos, with Kaiser as Chairman. He has created a \\"capacity- building\\" program,Kennedy Center Programs: Programs for Organizations that offers mentoring services to the leaders of 33 African American, Latino, Asian American and Native American arts groups from across the United States, and has instituted similar programs for over 250 arts organizations in New York City and 74 in the Washington, D.C. metro area. He has established a fellows programKennedy Center Programs: Fellowships for arts managers, enabling students and practicing arts managers to study at the Kennedy Center in a practicum that exposes them to the day-to-day work of the center's departments, from marketing and fundraising to programming and operations. =Arts in Crisis= Kaiser launched Arts In Crisis: A Kennedy Center Initiative in early February 2009, which provides free arts management consultation to arts organizations across the United States. Within 24 hours of unveiling the site, the program received 110 emails from 31 states. \\"[The initiative] is a high-tech support service through which arts administrators can talk to the Center's personnel about the challenges of shrinking income, budget-conscious audiences and other difficulties in keeping the doors open.\\" Arts in Crisis: A Kennedy Center Initiative is a response to the emergency facing arts organizations throughout the United States. The program, open to non-profit 501(c)(3) performing arts organizations, provides free and confidential planning assistance in areas pertinent to maintaining a vital performing arts organization during a troubled economy. Over 100 experienced arts leaders from across the country are volunteering their time to serve as mentors to organizations in need. Since the initiative's launch in February 2009, the Kennedy Center has hosted symposia and arts community conversations in major cities across the country. =Arts in Crisis: 50 State Tour= In June, 2009, the Kennedy Center launched a 50 state tour supporting the Arts in Crisis initiative. Michael Kaiser travels to cities in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia to lead arts management symposia. At each event, hosted by a local arts organization, Kaiser addresses the challenges facing non-profit performing arts organizations in each city through such areas as fundraising, building more effective Boards of Trustees, budgeting, and marketing. Other activities Kaiser is also a cultural ambassador for the U.S. State Department, advising performing arts organizations around the world on building institutional strength through marketing, strategic planning, and fundraising. He has created an online educational forum for arts administrators,Kennedy Center Arts Management Programs where professionals and students in the field can share experience, ask and answer questions, and seek employment and board opportunities. In June 2009, Kaiser became a weekly blogger for The Huffington Post.

Past spending and personal debt are considered when creating a personal budget. There are several methods and tools available for creating, using and adjusting a personal budget. For example, jobs are an income source, while bills and rent payments are expenses.  Home budget  A budget allocates or distributes expected income to expected expenses and intended savings.

Such budgets can be organized in ring binders or a file cabinet. Simpler still are pre-formatted budgeting books or bookkeeping forms in which a budget can be created by filling in the blanks. =Spreadsheet software= Spreadsheet software allows budgeting by performing calculations using formulas, for example in keeping track of income and expenditure. A drawback of budget spreadsheets is that some do not offer date-shifting, so information has to be re-entered or moved at the end of each month. =Money-management software= Some software is written specifically for money management. Products are designed to keep track of individual account information, such as checking, savings or money-market accounts. These programs can categorize past expenses and display monthly reports that are useful for budgeting future months. =Money-management websites= Several websites have been introduced to help manage personal finances. Some may have a privacy policy governing the use and sharing of supplied financial information. =Spending-management software = Spending- management software is a variation of money-management software. Unlike typical budgeting that allocates future personal income towards expenses, savings and debt repayment, this type of software utilizes a known amount of money, the cash on hand, to give the user information regarding what is left to spend in the current month. This method eliminates some of the guesswork associated with forecasting what a person might receive for income when it comes to allocating budgeted money. Like money-management software, some spending-management software packages can connect to online bank accounts in order to retrieve a current status report.  Concepts  Personal budgeting, while not particularly difficult, tends to carry a negative connotation among many people . Sticking to a few basic concepts helps to avoid several common pitfalls of budgeting. =Purpose= A budget should have a purpose or defined goal that is achieved within a certain time period. Knowing the source and amount of income and the amounts allocated to expense events are as important as when those cash flow events occur. =Simplicity= The more complicated the budgeting process is, the less likely a person is to keep up with it. The purpose of a personal budget is to identify where income and expenditure is present in the common household; it is not to identify each individual purchase ahead of time. How simplicity is defined with regards to the use of budgeting categories varies from family to family, but many small purchases can generally be lumped into one category (Car, Household items, etc.). =Flexibility= The budgeting process is designed to be flexible; the consumer should have an expectation that a budget will change from month to month, and will require monthly review. Cost overruns in one category of a budget should in the next month be accounted for or prevented. For example, if a family spends $40 more than they planned on food in spite of their best efforts, next month's budget should reflect an approximate $40 increase and corresponding decrease in other parts of the budget. \\"Busting the budget\\" is a common pitfall in personal budgeting; frequently busting the budget can allow consumers to fall into pre-budgeting spending habits. Anticipating budget- busting events (and underspending in other categories), and modifying the budget accordingly, allows consumers a level of flexibility with their incomes and expenses. =Budgeting for irregular income= Special precautions need to be taken for families operating on an irregular income. Households with an irregular income should keep two common major pitfalls in mind when planning their finances: spending more than their average income, and running out of money even when income is on average. Clearly, a household's need to estimate their average (yearly) income is paramount; spending, which will be relatively constant, needs to be maintained below that amount. A budget being an approximate estimation, room for error should always be allowed so keeping expenses 5% or 10% below the estimated income is a prudent approach. When done correctly, households should end any given year with about 5% of their income left over. Of course, the better the estimates, the better the results will be. To avoid running out of money because expenses occur before the money actually arrives (known as a cash flow problem in business jargon) a \\"safety cushion\\" of excess cash (to cover those months when actual income is below estimations) should be established. There is no easy way to develop a safety cushion, so families frequently have to spend less than they earn until they have accumulated a cushion. This can be a challenging task particularly when starting during a low spot in the earning cycle, although this is how most budgets begin. In general, households that start out with expenses that are 5% or 10% below their average income should slowly develop a cushion of savings that can be accessed when earnings are below average. Whether this rate of building a cushion is fast enough for a given financial situation depends on how variable income is, and whether the budgeting process starts at a high or low point during the earnings cycles.  Allocation guidelines  There are several guidelines to use when allocating money for a budget as well. Past spending is one of the most important priorities; a critical step in most personal budgeting strategies involves keeping track of expenses via receipts over the past month so that spending for the month can be reconciled with budgeted spending for the next month. Any of the following allocation guidelines may be used; choose one that will work well with your situation. = The 60% Solution = The 60% Solution is a budgeting system created by former MSN Money's editor-in-chief, Richard Jenkins. The name \\"The 60% Solution\\" originates from Jenkins' suggestion on spending 60% of a household's gross income (before taxes) on fixed expenses. Fixed expenses includes federal, state and Social Security taxes, insurance, regular bills and living expenses such as food and clothing, car and house payments. The other 40% breaks down as follows, with 10% allocated to each category: *Retirement: Money set aside into a Pension or other retirement account (e.g. IRA or 401(k)). *Long-term savings: Money set aside for car purchases, major home fix-ups, or to pay down substantial debt loads. *Irregular expenses: Vacations, major repair bills, new appliances, etc. *Fun money: Money set aside for entertainment purposes. If an individual has a high amount of non- mortgage debt, Jenkins advises that the 20% apportioned to retirement and long-term savings be directed towards paying off debt; once the debt is paid off, the 20% (Retirement + Savings) is to be immediately redirected back into the original categories. According to Jenkins, tracking each individual expense is unnecessary, as the balance of his primary checking account is roughly equivalent to the amount of money that can be spent in this plan. Software designed to easily set up and track a 60% Solution Budget is built into the \\"deluxe\\" and higher versions of Microsoft Money 2007 and Microsoft Money Plus.  Following a budget  Once a budget is constructed and the proper amounts are allocated to their proper categories, the focus for personal budgeting turns to following the budget. As with allocation, there are various methods available for following a budget. Envelope Accounting or the Envelope System is a method of budgeting where on a regular basis (i.e. monthly, biweekly, etc.) a certain amount of money is set aside for a specific purpose, or category, in an envelope marked for that purpose. Then anytime you make a purchase you look in the envelope for the type of purchase being considered to see if there are sufficient funds to make the purchase. If the money is there, all is well. Otherwise, you have three options: 1) you do not make the purchase; 2) you wait until you can allocate more money to that envelope; 3) you sacrifice another category by moving money from its associated envelope. The flip side is true as well, if you do not spend everything in the envelope this month then the next allocation adds to what is already there resulting in more money for the next month. With envelope budgeting, the amount of money left to spend in a given category can be calculated at any time by counting the money in the envelope. Optionally, each envelope can be marked with the amount due each month (if a bill is known ahead of time) and the due date for the bill. = Spreadsheet budgeting with date-shifting = Budget spreadsheets with date-shifting typically offer a detailed view of a 12-month, income and expense, plan. A good way to follow and manage a budget when using a spreadsheet that offers date-shifting is to set the current month a few months before the current month along the 12-month cycle, month 4 for example. In this way previous expenses and results can be viewed when creating or adjusting the budgeting planning.  Avoid a few pitfalls  Once you have a budget it is also important to follow it and manage within the budget allocated. Pitfalls to watch out for are as below: * Have a goal in mind * Know the future expenses * Do not get too harsh on entertainment & personal expenses * Plan for the unexpected * Track your spending & review it regularly * Adjust and update budget accordingly regularly  See also  * Debtors Anonymous * Envelope System * Personal financial management * The Total Money Makeover * Zero-based budgeting  References  Category:Budgets Budget ","title":"Personal budget"},{"id":"3663788","text":"Chandler High School may refer to: * Chandler High School (Victoria) in Keysborough, Victoria, Australia * Chandler High School (Arizona) in Chandler, Arizona, USA * Chandler High School (Oklahoma) in Chandler, Oklahoma, USA, listed on the NRHP in Oklahoma See also * Chandler School ","title":"Chandler High School"},{"id":"3663795","text":"Mellow Candle were a progressive folk rock band.

By 1972, the lineup had expanded to include Dave Williams on guitar, Frank Boylan on bass, and William Murray on drums. With this lineup in place, the band released their only album, Swaddling Songs (Deram Records), which was commercially unsuccessful at the time. Over the years, however, the lone album by the band has received considerable critical acclaim and original vinyl copies are now very valuable. Boylan was later replaced by Steve Borrill (ex-Spirogyra), but shortly afterwards the band split up.  After Mellow Candle  After the band's dissolution, Simonds worked with Thin Lizzy, Jade Warrior, and Mike Oldfield. Boylan played with Gary Moore, while Murray contributed to albums by Kevin Ayers, Amazing Blondel, Mike Oldfield, and Paul Kossoff. In 1991, \\"Silver Song\\" was covered by All About Eve as a B-side to some versions of their single, \\"Farewell Mr. Sorrow\\". 1996 saw the release of The Virgin Prophet, a collection of previously unreleased material by the band, including early versions of many of the songs later released on Swaddling Songs. Some of these sessions featured Richard Coughlan of Caravan on drums, although his sessions do not feature on The Virgin Prophet. In 1996, Simonds recorded Six Elementary Songs, released in 1997 on the Tokyo-based Evangel Records. In 1999, Simonds recorded a version of Syd Barrett's setting of the James Joyce poem \\"Golden Hair\\" for Russell Mills' album, Pearl and Umbra. 2006-7 saw the participation of Simonds in a musical project called Fovea Hex, alongside Brian Eno, Roger Eno, film composer Carter Burwell, Andrew McKenzie of the Hafler Trio, Steven Wilson, Colin Potter (of Nurse With Wound), Robert Fripp, Percy Jones, and others. The project was favourably reviewed by Pitchfork Media.Pitchforkmedia.com/BloomPitchforkmedia.com/Huge Pitchforkmedia.com/Allure Also in 2006, Simonds performed a version of \\"Idumaea\\" for Current 93's album Black Ships Ate The Sky, and a version of \\"Cockles and Mussels\\" for Matmos's EP \\"For Alan Turing\\".

It was founded by Pierre Boulez in 1972 for this purpose, the first permanent organization of its type in the world. Since then the Ensemble has toured extensively both in France and abroad, appearing especially at international festivals. Beyond performing they also have teaching and other outreach activities to support young musicians, composers and conductors. Organization and purpose The Ensemble consists of thirty one full-time soloists in various instruments, who are dedicated to the performance and promotion of contemporary chamber music written in the 20th and 21st centuries. They exist to fill a need for musicians who can work with new playing techniques and composition styles prevalent in this kind of music. The Ensemble is resident at the Philharmonie de Paris, under artistic director Matthias Pintscher and assistant director Julien Leroy, with their activities financed by the French Ministry of Culture and the city of Paris. The Ensemble InterContemporain after a performance of Boulez' Sur Incises in Barbican Hall, London, April 2015 They perform about thirty times a year in their home city, and tour extensively both in France and abroad, especially at international festivals. These concerts regularly include the premieres of new compositions, often commissioned by the Ensemble itself, which gives preference to young composers who have not yet had their work performed by the organization. The Ensemble has over 2,000 contemporary works in their repertoire, much of which has been recorded and includes composers such as Elliott Carter, Luigi Dallapiccola, Luciano Berio, along with the complete works of Boulez, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, Alejandro Romero, George Benjamin, Roberto Carnevale and Ivan Fedele. Their support for composers goes beyond playing their work in public and includes collaborating with composers both in the creation and interpretation processes. One reason for this is that the techniques and composition style of contemporary music is significantly different from classical music, and composer notation systems vary, especially with the indications of these new techniques. The Ensemble also supports young musicians which includes workshops at schools, master classes and more for conservatory students, professional and amateur musicians and training for conductors and composers. Since 2004 individual members have been tutoring young instrumentalists, conductors and composers in contemporary music as part of the Lucerne Festival Academy (Lucerne Festival). In addition, they collaborate with other kinds of artists from the fields of dance, theater, video and visual arts. The organization collaborates regularly with the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (Institute of Acoustic Music Research and Coordination) which sponsors research and concerts to showcase technological innovations in composition. History The Ensemble intercontemporain was founded in 1976 by composer and conductor Pierre Boulez, with the support of French Minister of Cultura Michel Guy and the collaboration of Nicholas Snowman. It is the first permanent contemporary music ensemble, founded to provide performers for contemporary chamber music. The idea for the Ensemble came from Boulez‚Äôs experiences as part of the historical avant garde of Darmstadt, Germany in the 1950s, contemporary of Stockhausen, Berio, Ligeti and Nono. He began his career as a composer in contemporary music, moving onto conducting orchestras such as New York Philharmonic (1971‚Äì1978) and the BBC Symphony Orchestra (1971‚Äì1975). He states that his first love is composition and noted the lack of venues to premiere and promote new music, so he created the Ensemble for playing and producing music, along with the Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique for academic work into the same field. The Ensemble was based at the Cit√© de la Musique in Paris from 1995 until 2015, when it moved to the Philharmonie de Paris. Boulez held the position of president, with P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s becoming the first musical director, appointed by Boulez in 1979. It has had several notable music directors including American David Robertson (1992‚Äì2000), Jonathan Nott (2000‚Äì2003), Finnish Susanna M√§lkki (2006‚Äì2013) and the current director German Matthias Pintscher (September 2013‚Äì ).\\"Matthias Pintscher est nomm√© Directeur musical de l'Ensemble intercontemporain\\" / \\"Matthias Pintscher appointed Music Director of the Ensemble intercontemporain\\" (Press Release).

He served fourteen terms in the United States House of Representatives from the West Side of Manhattan, from 1923 until his death in 1949. Bloom was the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee from 1939 to 1947 and again in 1949, during a critical period of American foreign policy. In the run-up to World War II, he took charge of high-priority foreign-policy legislation for the Roosevelt Administration, including authorization for Lend Lease in 1941. He oversaw Congressional approval of the United Nations and of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) which worked to assist millions of displaced people in Europe. He was a member of the American delegation at the creation of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945 and at the Rio Conference of 1947. Bloom was especially concerned with the fate of European Jews but was unable to overcome very strong resistance to admitting Jews or any refugees before the war. He argued vigorously after the war that the United States needed to take in larger numbers of refugees. He adopted the Zionist position that mandated Palestine should become the refuge for Jewish victims of the Holocaust. He urgently lobbied President Harry Truman in 1948 to immediately recognize the Jewish state of Israel, which Truman did. When the Republicans took control of the Foreign Affairs Committee after the 1946 election, Bloom worked closely with the new chairman, Charles Eaton. They secured approval for the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan.Eleonora W. Schoenebaum, ed. Political Profiles: The Truman Years (1978) pp 40‚Äì41 Early life Bloom was born March 9, 1870, in Pekin, Illinois, to Polish-Jewish immigrants who soon moved to San Francisco. He was introduced to theater production in his early teens, then became a theater manager, staging boxing matches featuring \\"Gentleman Jim\\" Corbett. Seeking ever more spectacular attractions, he attended the Exposition Universelle (1889) in Paris, where he was particularly taken with the dancers and acrobats of the \\"Algerian Village,\\" somewhat representative of France's Algerian colony. Chicago World's Fair Bloom established his reputation in 1893 at the age of 23 while developing the mile-long Midway Plaisance at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The Midway Plaisance offered enticing games and exhibitions presented by private vendors, removed from the more conservative Beaux-Arts splendor of the official exposition and arranged around its \\"Court of Honor\\". After initially entrusting the midway to a Harvard anthropology professor, the committee turned to Bloom, whose \\"Midway\\" was so successful that the term resided henceforth in the American lexicon. At the \\"Street in Cairo\\", the North African belly dance was reinvented as the \\"hootchy-kootchy dance\\" to a tune made up by Bloom, \\"The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid\\", whose century-old lyrics had traditionally been sung by young boys: \\"O they don't wear pants/on the sunny side of France\\"; \\"There's a place in France/where the women wear no pants\\"; \\"...where the naked ladies dance\\", etc. Bloom did not copyright the tune, which he'd conceived on a piano at the Press Club of Chicago. Bloom also published and promoted ‚ÄúCoon, Coon, Coon‚Äù, one of the most famous entries in the coon song genre. Bloom's role in helping to develop the fair had been at the behest of Mayor Carter Harrison, Sr., who was assassinated only days before the exposition closed. Bloom then rose in stature in Chicago's tough First Ward among the Democratic party's bosses \\"Bathhouse\\" John Coughlin and \\"Hinky Dink\\" Kenna. Soon, he became Chicago branch manager of M. Witmark & Sons, the largest publisher of sheet music in the United States, and by 1896 he was publishing under his own name and introducing photolithographs to make the scores more visually appealing. In 1897 he married Evelyn Hechheimer and settled in a fashionable district on South Prairie Avenue, billing himself as \\"Sol Bloom, the Music Man\\".Sol Bloom, The Autobiography of Sol Bloom, New York: Putnam House, 1948. At the turn of the 20th century, he was awarded, to much fanfare, the first musical copyright of the new century for \\"I Wish I Was in Dixie Land Tonight\\" by Raymond A. Browne. Move to New York and politics In 1903 he moved to New York City, where he dabbled in real estate and expanded his national chain of department store music departments. In New York, he sold Victor Talking Machines. Bloom soon switched his political affiliation from Republican to the Democrats' Tammany Hall, so that when Representative-elect Samuel Marx of New York's 19th Congressional District died in 1922, Bloom was invited to run and won the usually Republican \\"silk stocking district\\" of Manhattan's Upper East Side by 145 votes. He represented the district until his death in 1949. A confidential 1943 analysis of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office stated that In Congress Bloom oversaw celebration of the George Washington Bicentennial (1932) and presided over the U.S. Constitution Sesquicentennial Exposition (1937). He chaired the House Committee on Foreign Affairs beginning in 1939. A strong supporter of Zionism, Bloom was a delegate to the convention in San Francisco that established the United Nations. The first words of the Preamble to the United Nations Charter, \\"We, the Peoples of the United Nations .. .\\" were suggested by Bloom. In January 1946, Bloom represented the US at the first meeting of the UN General Assembly in London. He called his success in persuading a majority of the Assembly to allow the new United Nations organization to assume the finances of the earlier United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration \\"the supreme moment\\" of his life. Legacy The Sol Bloom Playground in Manhattan is named in his honor. His papers, most of them dating from 1935 to 1949, are stored at the New York Public Library. Bloom lost a bet with Washington Senators pitcher Walter Johnson after Johnson successfully threw a silver dollar across Fredericksburg, Virginia's Rappahannock River. Although the wager had been highly publicized, Bloom cited technicalities and refused to pay. Sol Bloom spearheaded the writing and publication of The Story of the Constitution, published in 1937.

Founded in 1972 through a gift from the West German government on the 25th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, GMF contributes research and analysis on transatlantic and global issues; convenes policy and business leaders at international conferences; provides exchange opportunities for emerging American and European leaders; and supports initiatives to strengthen democracies. GMF focuses on policy, leadership, and civil society. GMF is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has offices in several European cities. Current programs Among its programs and initiatives are: the Alliance for Securing Democracy, the Brussels Forum, Atlantic Dialogues, Transatlantic Academy, and the Transatlantic Trends Survey. GMF's policy programs include: Asia, the European Union, Europe's East and Russia, Foreign and Security Policy, Energy Security, NATO, Trade and Investment and Urban and Regional Policy. GMF's leadership programs include the Manfred W√∂rner Seminar, the Marshall Memorial Fellowship, the Transatlantic Inclusion Leaders Network, Marshall Seminar, the Transatlantic Leadership Seminar, the Congress Bundestag Forum and the Young Transatlantic Network. GMF's civil society projects include the Balkan Trust for Democracy, the Black Sea Trust for Regional Cooperation, and the Fund for Belarus Democracy. Leadership The president of GMF is Karen Donfried, who joined in April 2014. Donfried was previously special assistant to President Barack Obama. Past presidents of GMF include Benjamin H. Read (1973‚Äì1977), Robert Gerald Livingston (1977‚Äì1981), Frank E. Loy (1981‚Äì1995), and Craig Kennedy (1996‚Äì2014)Members of GMF's Board of Trustees History =Foundation= GMF was founded as a permanent memorial to Marshall Plan assistance through a grant from the West German government. It was founded by Guido Goldman, who was the director of Harvard's West European Studies program in the early 1970s. Goldman, an American whose family had fled Germany in 1940, lobbied the West German government, particularly Finance Minister Alex M√∂ller for an endowment to promote European and U.S. relations on the 25th anniversary of Marshall Plan aid. Working with a planning group that was to constitute the Fund's initial Board of Trustees - including physicist Harvey Brooks, diplomat Robert Ellsworth, journalist Max Franke, economist Richard N. Cooper, and educator Howard Swearer - Goldman eventually received an agreement to support an independent institution in 1971. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, announced the creation of GMF in a speech on June 5, 1972, at Harvard, saying that it would help increase U.S.-European cooperation and mutual understanding. Brandt wrote four years later: Other charter members of the Board of Trustees included economist Carl Kaysen, judge Arlin M. Adams, and businessman Donald M. Kendall. The first president, selected in 1973, was Benjamin H. Read, who was later to become U.S. Under Secretary of State for Management. =Early days (1972‚Äì1989)= In the 1970s and 1980s, GMF dispersed grants in accordance with its mission, including to academic researchers and to the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. It also provided the initial funding for the Institute for International Economics, now the Peterson Institute for International Economics. By 1977, the organization had spent more than $7 million on nearly 100 projects involving the United States, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Japan and Canada. Academic Michael Naumann has said that GMF was one of the first think tanks to focus on the importance of soft power at a time when most academic focus was on military issues. In addition to grants, GMF also began a U.S.-Europe parliamentary exchange program and the Marshall Memorial Fellowship, which has since funded the exchange of over 3000 young leaders across the Atlantic. 1977 was also the first year GMF organized a parliamentary exchange between the United States and Europe, with 12 young European parliamentarians visiting the U.S. Congress in Washington. In 1980, GMF opened its first European office in Bonn. In 1985, the West German government renewed its grant to GMF. In 1987, George Kennan gave the keynote address at a conference organized in West Berlin by GMF to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan. Also in the 1980s, GMF supported programs such as a National Governors Association initiative to tackle acid rain, and began to work actively with the democracy movements of Central and Eastern Europe through the funding of small grants. =GMF expansion (1989‚Äìpresent)= After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, GMF was among the first U.S. organizations to establish a presence in what had been East Berlin, in 1990. It moved its Bonn operations to Berlin in 1992. In 2006, GMF acquired its current headquarters in Washington, DC, a building that until 1963 had housed the West German chancery, and that had hosted such figures as John F. Kennedy, Konrad Adenauer, Lyndon B. Johnson, and George C. Marshall. German Chancellor Angela Merkel dedicated the new building. GMF rapidly expanded its work in Central and Eastern Europe and played an instrumental role during the 1990s in assisting with the transitions to democracy in this region. In the 2000s, GMF established an office in Bratislava for activities in Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkan Trust for Democracy in Belgrade, the Black Sea Trust in Bucharest, and an office in Warsaw. In 2001, GMF established a center in Brussels and an office in Paris. GMF also began to expand its public policy activities. In 2002, GMF conducted its first survey, along with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The next year, it was renamed Transatlantic Trends, and became an annual indicator of public opinion on both sides of the Atlantic. GMF established its Transatlantic Fellows program to enable permanent resident expertise on global public policy issues. It also founded the Transatlantic Academy for visiting scholars, and initiated the Transatlantic Take commentary series. GMF‚Äôs exchange programs also expanded with the addition of American Marshall Memorial Fellows, the initiation of the Manfred Worner Seminar for defense specialists, and the establishment of the Congress-Bundestag Forum. By the mid-2000s, GMF established itself as a major convener on transatlantic issues. In 2004, GMF organized a major conference in Istanbul in the run up to the NATO Summit, which led to the opening of an office in Ankara. In 2005, GMF hosted President George W. Bush in Brussels, where he delivered the first foreign speech of his second term. The next year, 2006, saw the first Brussels Forum, now the preeminent conference on transatlantic relations. GMF's convening continued to grow every year and began hosting expert dialogues on Turkey, China, India, and the Mediterranean, as well as events alongside international climate change summits in Copenhagen and Cancun. In 2012, GMF added a second annual event, The Atlantic Dialogues, in Morocco. Speakers at GMF events have included John Kerry, Robert Gates, Madeleine Albright, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Catherine Ashton, Condoleezza Rice, Wolfgang Schauble, Gordon Brown, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, among many other European and U.S. heads of state and government, cabinet ministers, and legislators. Major conferences =Brussels Forum= Brussels Forum is an annual high-level meeting of influential U.S., European, and global political, corporate, and intellectual leaders in Brussels. Participants include heads of state and government, senior officials from the European Union institutions and the member states, U.S. Cabinet officials, Congressional representatives, parliamentarians, academics, and media. =Atlantic Dialogues= The Atlantic Dialogues is an annual event in Morocco that brings together around 300 high-level public- and private-sector leaders from around the Atlantic Basin - including Africa and Latin America - for discussion on cross-regional issues ranging from security to economics, migration to energy. =Stockholm China Forum= Stockholm China Forum is a bi-annual, trilateral conversation between European, U.S. and Chinese officials, academics, business leaders and other influencers. The forum has run since 2007, when it was established to create an informal, off- the-record space to foster transatlantic cooperation on China policy, and trilateral cooperation on areas of agreement and mutual interest.

The station's transmitter is located on Television Hill in Baltimore, and its studios are located in Towson. History 106.5 FM signed on June 30, 1960 as WCBM-FM, a sister station to WCBM (680 AM). In 1968, Metromedia, which had bought the WCBM stations in 1964, sold WCBM-FM to The A.S. Abell Company, owner of WMAR- TV and the Sunpapers, for $200,000; the sale was necessary because Metromedia's purchase of WASH in Washington put the company over the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s ownership limits of the time, which limited a company to owning seven FM radio stations. Abell changed the call letters to WMAR-FM; this was the second incarnation of WMAR-FM, as an earlier station with those call letters was operated by Abell on 97.9 FM (now WIYY) from 1948 to 1950. The call letters were changed to WRLX in 1982. For many years, the station had played beautiful music. But by the early 1980s, the target demographic of the station had aged beyond what was termed \\"profitable\\" and the station decided to switch to a new format. The WMAR-FM call sign returned on July 14, 1983; at 10:30 p.m. on July 28, it became one of many \\"Hot Hits\\" CHR/Top 40 stations throughout the country, consulted by programmer Mike Joseph. WMAR-FM, also known as \\"Hot Hits 106\\", was the main competitor to Baltimore's other CHR, B 104. When the station was sold to S&F; Broadcasting in 1985, it retained the Hot Hits format, but its call letters changed to WMKR-FM on March 15, 1985 and its name became \\"Hot Hits K-106.\\" The station was sold once again to Capitol Broadcasting in 1986. Capitol decided to change the format to adult contemporary and the name to \\"Mix 106.5\\" that October 17.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1986/RR-1986-10-24.pdf \\"K-106\\" signed off by playing \\"Broken Wings\\" by Mr. Mister, and then the jingles for each of its DJs. \\"Mix\\" was then introduced, and the call letters were changed to WWMX. Initially, WWMX played the \\"Best Mix of the '60s, '70s, and '80s.\\" For years, many (including the local press at times) mistakenly thought the calls were \\"WMIX\\", leading the station to insert quick \\"W-Mix,\\" with the word \\"Mix\\" spoken, liners between commercials. These were not legal station identifications, as 106.5 still identified itself as \\"WWMX Baltimore\\" at the top of the hour, but they allowed the station to claim listeners who mistakenly identified 106.5 as \\"WMIX\\" in their diaries. The \\"WMIX\\" callsign is actually used for AM and FM stations in Mount Vernon, Illinois, whose broadcaster, Withers Broadcasting, registered the \\"WMIX\\" branding as a registered trademark. Shortly after the trademark was approved, the station dropped the \\"W-Mix\\" liners. In 1990, the station's adult contemporary format evolved into a Hot Adult Contemporary format, playing some hip hop, and classic hard rock. Many urban contemporary songs that have charted high on the CHR/pop charts have been played on WWMX. Capitol sold the station to American Radio Systems in 1993, who later merged with Infinity Broadcasting in 1997. Infinity changed names in 2005 to CBS; WWMX is now owned by CBS Radio. In 2008, the station began shifting towards a mainstream Top 40 (CHR) direction (similar to rival WIHT in Washington, D.C.) as it began incorporating more rhythmic hits, but still incorporated 1990s hits played on hot AC stations, thus classified as an Adult Top 40 station. As of April 2009, the station has dramatically shifted away from hot AC, primarily focusing on top 40 hits much like a CHR station, but still plays some music from the mid to late 2000s, and dropped the remaining '80s and '90s songs (most of those songs have moved to their HD3 channel). WWMX had not had much rivalry in the market until CHR station WZFT replaced alternative rock station WCHH by late 2009. A Washington, D.C. version with the same format as WWMX, despite the partial blocking of WWMX's signal in Washington, D.C. by sister station WJFK- FM, launched in April 2009 on WIAD. In July 2015, Mediabase moved the station from the Hot AC panel to their Top 40 panel.\\"Mediabase Published Panel Changes\\" from All Access (July 10, 2015) In September of 2020, Mediabase moved WWMX back to their Hot AC panel.https://www.allaccess.com/mediabase/q/report/stations/by/format/for/A2 On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. =WWMX-HD2= In 2006, WWMX's HD2 was launched with a Top 40 \\"New CHR\\" format. It was replaced in January 2010 with a rhythmic dance format billed as MIX2, playing a mix of hit-driven rhythmic dance, hip hop and pop tracks and remixes. On August 1, 2011, it was replaced with a modern rock format branded as \\"HFS @ 97-5\\" (simulcasted on translator W248AO 97.5 FM). As per an agreement with the translator's owner, Hope Christian Church of Marlton, the format was moved to another translator, W285EJ (104.9 FM), on April 2, 2014 at 6 PM (their \\"Hope FM\\" programming would move to W248AO, in return).

History The station signed on in 1966 as WIQT, broadcasting from studios on Hanover Square in Horseheads during daylight hours on 1000 kHz. It was the fifth station to sign on in Chemung County. It was a beautiful music station (extremely easy listening) in its early years. WIQT served as the headquarters of a flood-emergency network during the Hurricane Agnes flood of June 22 and 23, 1972, under the direction of chief engineer C. Michael Scullin and program director David G. Ridenour. It was the only Chemung County station that remained on the during the disaster, which kept all other stations off the air for over a week. Personnel from other stations volunteered to work alongside their WIQT colleagues to broadcast emergency information 24 hours a day, by special dispensation of the FCC to extend their daytime license. A US Army communications command post was set up in their studios, and a CB radio network node as well, for use by civil authorities. Later in 1972, an FM sister station WQIX went on the air, playing a modern country format. WIQT, owned by Elmira retailer Manny Panosian, moved down the dial to 820 kHz on January 7, 1988. It also moved into new studios in Downtown Elmira. The relocation had already been scheduled for a later date, but was expedited after the partial collapse of an external wall at the Horseheads location. Its former frequency and studios were picked up by a new Christian radio station, WLNL. Both stations kept Horseheads as their city of license. In Elmira, WIQT played classic country to complement the country format of its sister station. Its slogan \\"820 American\\" came about after program director David Rockwell submitted a list of possible slogans to general manager Ron Ferro and Ferro misread \\"820 AM.\\" Sabre Communications, which owned WCLI and Wink 106, entered into a limited marketing agreement to manage WIQT and WQIX late in 1994. It bought the stations several months later, enabling Sabre to move popular talk shows from WCLI to the more powerful WIQT. Sabre merged with Backyard Broadcasting in 2002. Backyard sold all of its New York assets to Community Broadcasters, LLC effective August 26, 2013, at a price of $3.6 million. Those assets were then spun off to Pennsylvania-based broadcaster Seven Mountains Media effective April 1, 2019. WIQT changed its call letters to WQIX on January 17, 1996. Its sister station added the -FM suffix. On February 21, 1997, it switched its call letters to WWLT. On January 13, 2020, WWLZ changed their format from talk to a simulcast of classic rock-formatted WMTT 94.7 FM Tioga, Pennsylvania, which was in the process of being sold to Seven Mountains Media.WWLZ Drops Talk for WMTT Simulcast Radioinsight - January 14, 2020 It had previously aired a talk radio format that aired the Premiere Networks lineup (Glenn Beck Radio Program, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Sean Hannity Show and Coast to Coast AM) during the workday and overnight, Cumulus Media Networks programs (First Light, Imus in the Morning, The Mark Levin Show, The John Batchelor Show) during the evening and in morning drive, MRN races and Elmira Jackals hockey. On July 3, 2020, WWLZ changed its callsign to WMTT and rebranded as \\"101 the Met\\" as part of a five-station format swap, which made 820/101.3 the main signals for the Met, while adding a simulcast sister station at the former WPGI 100.9 (renamed WMTT-FM).https://radioinsight.com/headlines/190049/seven-mountains-media- flips-five-stations-in-elmira/ FM translator In addition to the main station broadcasting at 820 kHz, the programming is relayed to FM translators.https://7mmelmira.com/#93-5fm This information can be seen on this website by moving the pointer to The Met logo.

The game was released on 6 February 2015 for Windows and OS X following a successful Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the project. The game takes place in the universe of Failbetter's browser adventure game Fallen London, in which Victorian-era London has been moved beneath the earth's surface to the edge of the Unterzee, a vast underground ocean. On 11 October 2016, the game's first downloadable content Zubmariner was released, which allows players to explore beneath the surface of the \\"zee\\". A sequel, Sunless Skies, was announced in September 2016. It surpassed its funding goals on Kickstarter and was released on 31 January 2019. Gameplay The player takes on the role of an Unterzee steamship captain, whose background and ambitions are customisable. The player can \\"win\\" by achieving their chosen ambition, such as becoming Fallen London's most celebrated explorer or amassing enough wealth to retire. Resources to achieve these ends are acquired by discovering new locations, trading goods across the Unterzee, battling ships and \\"zee monsters\\", and completing \\"storylet\\" quests. There are several roguelike gameplay elements, such as partially randomised maps and permanent character death, but subsequent characters can inherit some of their predecessor's possessions, and a player may create a will to ensure lodging and wealth for their successors. The actual gameplay consists of two modes- the player controlling the movement of the ship on the map with combat taking place in the same mode, and a story mode where the player is presented with several choices (sometimes accompanied by a skill challenge) in a card- like format. The ship movement is quite slow. This, accompanied by the music creates an atmosphere of tension. The Unterzee has multiple islands, with each island having its own storylet quests. To progress in the quests, the player has to provide an item or complete a skill check. To acquire the items, the player usually is not able to acquire them at that island and must go to different islands or defeat sea beasts. The skill check takes one of the player's five skills (Hearts, Iron, Pages, Mirrors, and Veils) and based on the value of the skill gives the player a chance to pass the test. Passing the tests often will give the player items, while failing them will occasionally harm the player and will often prevent the player from trying again for a period of time. Several bits of writing and settings in the game are literary allusions ‚Äì for instance, the very premise of a subterranean \\"Sunless Sea\\" is a reference to the poem Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which is further reflected by the existence of a Khanate and an \\"Abora Gate\\". Development On 3 September 2013, Failbetter Games launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund Sunless Sea with a funding goal of ¬£60,000. The project was successfully funded, receiving around ¬£100,000 from over 4000 backers. On 13 May 2014, the studio launched a Greenlight campaign to release the game on Steam. The game was approved 15 days later. On 17 June, the game was soft launched on the developer's website, a Steam early access build was later released on 1 July. The game officially launched on 6 February 2015. A PlayStation 4 version, that includes the Zubmariner expansion, was released in August 2018. A Nintendo Switch version will be released on 23 April 2020. Reception Sunless Sea received mostly positive reviews from professional critics on launch, with the writing and setting being the most highly praised aspects of the game. Aggregate review website Metacritic assigned score of 81/100. IGN awarded it 8.3 out of 10 saying \\"Sunless Sea gives you a wonderful world to explore that's packed with memorable written vignettes and danger.\\" The game won Rock, Paper, Shotgun's award for best game writing of 2014, and was nominated for a Writer's Guild of Great Britain Best Writing in Videogames Award in 2015. GameSpot awarded it a score of 6.0 out of 10, saying \\"Sunless Sea is an ambitious work that attempts to capture the sheer kinetic thrill of discovery in a bottle without the inevitable entropy of player completion depleting it, and falls well short.\\" , the game has sold 100,000 copies. According to director Alexis Kennedy, sales had risen to 350,000 units by June 2018.http://weatherfactory.biz/after-the-dawn-what-happened-when-we-launched- cultist-simulator/ References External links * Category:2015 video games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:IOS games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:MacOS games Category:Open world video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Roguelike video games Category:Trade simulation games Category:Single-player video games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:Early access video games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games ","title":"Sunless Sea"},{"id":"3663849","text":"The Ditmar Award is Australia's oldest and best-known science fiction, fantasy and horror award, presented annually at the Australian \\"NatCon\\" since 1969.

Early life He was born into a well-to-do Jewish family. His older brother was the educator Joel Elias Spingarn, and his nephew was Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Stephen J. Spingarn. He graduated from Columbia College in 1897 and from Columbia Law School in 1899. Career Spingarn was one of the few white Americans who decided in the 1900s decade to support the radical demands for racial justice being voiced by W. E. B. Du Bois, in contrast to the gradualist views of Booker T. Washington. He served as head of the legal committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was one of its vice presidents from 1911. He interrupted his legal career to serve for several years as a United States Army captain in the Sanitary Corps during World War I and protested racial discrimination treatment of African Americans in the US military. He was very interested in furthering the cause of civil rights and improving the condition of black Americans. He succeeded his brother, Joel, as president of the NAACP in 1940 when the legal arm of the organization was spun off into the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and served as the NAACP's president until 1965. Collector Spingarn avidly amassed collections. One of them was of books, newspapers, and manuscripts on the black American experience worldwide that was \\"unique in its depth, breadth, and quality.\\"\\"Moorland-Spingarn Research Center,\\" Library Quarterly, vol. 58, no. 2, 143-163 (1988).

The bi-annual summits were called for in the Quebec-New York Corridor Agreement, signed in 2001 by the Plattsburgh-North Country Chamber of Commerce and the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec. This partnership was then embraced by the Quebec and New York State governments, creating a private-public partnership that endeavors to broaden and deepen economic connectivity between Quebec and New York, with a special focus on the bi-national corridor region from Quebec City and Montreal through Plattsburgh to Albany and New York City. The first Quebec-New York Economic Summit was conducted in Plattsburgh, New York in 2002 and was co-hosted by New York Governor George Pataki and Quebec Premier Bernard Landry. Subsequent summits were conducted in Montreal in 2004 and in Albany in 2004, co-hosted by Governor Pataki and Premier Jean Charest. The Quebec-New York Corridor initiative, including the Economic Summits, involve a multi-faceted agenda, with projects and collaborations in transportation, border operations, economic development, technology, energy and tourism. A broad grassroots alliance known as the Quebec-New York Corridor Coalition is coordinated by the Plattsburgh-North Country Chamber of Commerce, facilitating and promoting various efforts between the bi-annual Summits. \\"The third Summit,\\" Premier Jean Charest was quoted as saying in a press release on the Governor's web site, \\"consolidates the gains made at the two previous Summits. It opens new perspectives and partnership opportunities, especially in core fields, such as high technology, transportation, energy and academic sectors, not to mention tourism. I am convinced the combined efforts of business people on both sides of the border will not only help create new jobs, but will also help us to shoulder our new, shared responsibility for continental security.\\" The Fourth Quebec-New York Economic Summit was scheduled for November 17, 2008 in Montreal. Its special theme was: \\"Quebec-New York: The Green Corridor\\". Special emphasis was placed on partnerships and collaborations connected with the emerging green economy and clean technologies. The Summit was co-hosted by New York State Governor David Paterson and Quebec Premier Jean Charest, and was co-organized by the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of Quebec and the Plattsburgh-North Country Chamber of Commerce.

She pleaded guilty in June 2007 to tax evasion and obstructing the United States Senate investigation into the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal and was sentenced to four years probation.  Council of Republicans for Environmental Advocacy  Federici founded CREA with Norton and Americans for Tax Reform president Grover Norquist, a college friend of Abramoff, in 1997 with money Federici inherited; The organization was also funded by, and supported the goals of, mining and other industries.  Abramoff involvement  Federici introduced Jack Abramoff to Deputy Secretary of the Interior J. Steven Griles in March 2001, just before Griles started at the Department of the Interior. Abramoff donated more than $400,000 to CREA, after which time she allegedly began using her connections with Griles to influence him to make decisions beneficial to Abramoff's tribal benefactors. In emails, Abramoff claimed that \\"she is critical\\" to his work with the Department of Interior, especially with regards to preventing the Jena Band of Choctaws Indian Tribe from creating a casino, that would take money away from one of Abramoff's \\"core tribes\\". A February 18, 2003, email from Abramoff to Federici said \\"...This will be a PR disaster as you can imagine, especially if for some reason Interior agrees to approve this deal.

It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O- Pura to encompass a variety of other music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open- ended dissonance. Upon release, Beating as One reached number 19 on the Billboards Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts. Three songs from the album, \\"Autumn Sweater\\", \\"Sugarcube\\", and the cover \\"Little Honda\\", were released as singles. The album received considerable acclaim from music critics, who praised the band's ability to successfully expand the boundaries of nearly any pop style. The album is widely regarded as the band's best work and is frequently included on several publications' best album lists. In 2010, Rolling Stone placed it at number 86 on its list of 100 Best Albums of the Nineties. Background and recording I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the follow-up to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative direction for the band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, \\"I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is going to sound like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right.\\" At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: \\"What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, do you remember what you did?' Then we'll write something down‚Äîor maybe we won't.\\" Beating as One was recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by Roger Moutenot, who also produced the band's previous two albums. Kaplan described the recording sessions of the album as follows: \\"We hole up in a room and work for a really long time. Then we come out and blink our eyes because it's sunny out\\". Initially, the band did not intend to write a long album, but eventually felt that having a long album was the only way to accommodate the instrumental track \\"Spec Bebop\\", which the band felt it needed to be included in the album \\"by hook or by crook\\". Beating as One is the only Yo La Tengo album that was recorded on an ADAT magnetic tape format, even though it was mixed to analog later. Audio mixing took place at Big House and Magic Shop in New York City. Music and lyrics Beating as One expands Electr-O-Puras guitar-based pop to encompass a variety of other music genres, ranging from the bossa nova soundscapes of \\"Center of Gravity\\" to the electronic grooves of \\"Autumn Sweater\\", the krautrock jams of \\"Spec Bebop\\", the \\"jazzy goof\\" of \\"Moby Octopad\\", the trip hop sound of \\"Damage\\", and the psychedelic folk instrumentation of \\"We're an American Band\\", among others. The album also contains two cover songs: \\"Little Honda\\", a Beach Boys tune written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, and \\"My Little Corner of the World\\", recorded by Anita Bryant, although the band initially did not know she had ever recorded it. The former, which is a song that Kaplan learned for a solo guitar show, was originally used to make sure the recording equipment was set up right. However, it was ultimately included in the album because, according to bassist James McNew, \\"it just sort of turned out pretty good.\\" The title to the song \\"Moby Octopad\\" is a reference to Yo La Tengo's appearance on the 1995 Lollapalooza tour, where the band performed mid- afternoon sets on the festival's side stage. Often performing earlier in the afternoon was the artist Moby. One of the instruments that Moby used in his performance was the Roland Octapad, an electronic percussion instrument. When taking the stage for their own performance, Yo La Tengo frequently noticed road crew's tape with \\"MOBY OCTAPAD\\" written on it, still left on the stage after Moby's set. The band later used this anecdote as the title for an instrumental that they were jamming on. Lyrics unrelated to the Moby story were added later. Most of the lyrics on Beating as One deal with melancholy emotions. The track \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\", which is the first Yo La Tengo song sung by McNew, is about captives eventually expressing empathy toward their captors and vice versa. It was described by prominent music critic Robert Christgau as a \\"simulated Neil Young ballad\\". The song \\"Autumn Sweater\\", which is layered with complex rhythms and textures, explores themes of love and lack of communication, while \\"Center of Gravity\\" has been described as \\"a simple lo-fi devotional love song\\". Beating as One also marks the debut of Kaplan's falsetto singing, which was said to blur the line between his voice and that of drummer Georgia Hubley. The album's title is taken from a line in an unknown film. According to Kaplan, \\"I think it's a nice, evocative title‚Äîit seems to mean a lot but it doesn't really mean anything. It comes from a movie, but I'm not telling what movie. You'll have to see it one day and say, 'Eureka!'\\" Release Beating as One was released on April 22, 1997, by the independent record label Matador Records. The album reached number 19 on the Billboards Heatseekers Albums chart, becoming the first Yo La Tengo album to enter the charts. Three songs from the album, \\"Autumn Sweater\\", \\"Sugarcube\\", and \\"Little Honda\\", were released as singles or EPs in 1997. A music video featuring Mr. Show with Bob and Davids comedians David Cross and Bob Odenkirk was made for \\"Sugarcube\\". The song \\"Moby Octopad\\", which was not released as a single, peaked at number 4 on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997. As of March 2000, Beating as One has sold 73,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan, becoming Yo La Tengo's most commercially successful album at the time. In 2012, The Daily Beast reported that the record had sold 300,000 copies since release. An insert card in the CD release parodied the marketing leaflets that are sometimes inserted into the jewel case for a compact disc, promoting other products from the same label. It \\"advertised\\" albums by imaginary artists, like \\"Condo Fucks\\", \\"Unsanitary Napkins\\", and \\"K√ºnstler\\" in a variety of genres. In 2008, Yo La Tengo followed up on the joke by releasing Fuckbook, an album of covers credited to the \\"Condo Fucks\\". Critical reception Upon release, Beating as One received considerable acclaim from music critics. Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone felt that the album \\"proves that Yo La Tengo can master nearly any pop style [...] the music's ominousness is undercut by Yo La Tengo's infectious joy at simply making noise. It's just this joy that makes Yo La Tengo stand out amid their indie- rock peers\\". Similarly, in his review for Spin, Robert Christgau said that the album gave the band \\"the grace to professionalize toward the pop melodicism they've always loved.\\" He also felt that the first nine songs were perfect and considered \\"Autumn Sweater\\" as the \\"very peak\\" of the album. Chicago Tribune reviewer Greg Kot highlighted the album's diverse influences, stating that the band \\"fashions sprawling albums out of minimal instrumental strokes and soft voices.\\" The album's range of power and soft elements was noted. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne said that, while the band has always been \\"adept at striking a balance between hurricane-force dissonance and fragile serenity\\", Yo La Tengo \\"crack open their sound even wider here. Their muted, after-hours guitar drone is in full effect [...] As adults who still need to make a racket, they remain addicted to noise, but now the trio integrates the feedback into the arrangements, like squalls rumbling in the distance.\\" Dele Fadele of NME also praised the open-ended nature of the album, but criticized the instrumental \\"Spec Bebop\\" for being \\"constructed around some hurtful feedback, to end up as an endurance test.\\" In a very positive review, Jason Josephes of Pitchfork praised the album for exploring new directions, commenting that the band takes its \\"sonic inventions to new levels.\\" Beating as One was ranked number 5 in The Village Voices 1997 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, the band's highest position to date. In the poll's accompanying essay, Christgau referred to the album as one of his \\"favorite albums of the year, easy\\", alongside those by Pavement, Sleater-Kinney, and Arto Lindsay.

Since 2012 it forms part of the municipality of Oron. History Pal√©zieux is first mentioned in 1134 as de Palaisol. Under the rule of Savoy, the family de Pal√©zieux - mentioned in texts from 1154 - had their castle near the village, of which remains can be seen today (mainly a wall). The castle controlled a bridge on the River Broye, which was a source of profit through the various tolls and taxes. The bridge over the Broye was washed away in 1700, following a flood. It was rebuilt in 1750, following several petitions. Modernized, it is still in place. The creation of the separate settlement at Pal√©zieux-Gare came about with the commissioning of the railway line between Lausanne and Bern in 1862, which was built away from the original village (which became known as Pal√©zieux- Village). In 1876 the line from Payerne was added, which runs adjacent to Pal√©zieux-Village, and in 1903 the metre gauge line leading to the Gruy√®re was constructed, with its terminus at Pal√©zieux-Gare.

It is based on the 1844 novel The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. The film stars Mikhail Boyarsky as D'Artagnan, Veniamin Smekhov as Athos, Igor Starygin as Aramis, Valentin Smirnitsky as Porthos, Margarita Terekhova as Milady de Winter, Oleg Tabakov as King Louis XIII, Alisa Freindlich as Anne of Austria, Aleksandr Trofimov as Cardinal Richelieu, and Lev Durov as Captain de Tr√©ville. The film, and its numerous songs became extremely popular in the Soviet Union throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, and is now considered a classic. Three sequels were made: Musketeers Twenty Years After (1992), The Secret of Queen Anne or Musketeers Thirty Years After (1993) and The Return of the Musketeers, or The Treasures of Cardinal Mazarin (2009).  Plot  The film consists of three parts: *Part I: \\"Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan\\" (–ê—Ç–æ—Å, –ü–æ—Ä—Ç–æ—Å, –ê—Ä–∞–º–∏—Å –∏ –¥'–ê—Ä—Ç–∞–Ω—å—è–Ω) *Part II: \\"The Queen's Diamond Studs\\" (–ü–æ–¥–≤–µ—Å–∫–∏ –∫–æ—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤—ã) *Part III: \\"The Adventures Continue\\" (–ü—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞—é—Ç—Å—è) =Episode One= D‚ÄôArtagnan, a young country bumpkin rides to Paris in hopes of becoming a musketeer. In Meung he is insulted by Rochefort, an agent of the Cardinal. A fight ensues, and d‚ÄôArtagnan Is robbed and left bleeding. Later he meets M. De Tr√©ville, captain of the king‚Äôs musketeers. Suddenly, he sees Rochefort and jumps out the window. He crashes into Athos, a wounded musketeer who calls him an idiot and challenged him to a duel at noon. D‚ÄôArtagnan continues his chase, crashing into two other musketeers, Porthos and Aramis and gets challenged to two other duels. Arriving for the first duel, Athos duels d‚ÄôArtagnan until Porthos and Aramis arrive, and are astonished that they will all fight the same boy. The Cardinals Guards arrive and a fight ensues. The musketeers kill most of the guards and a few lucky ones escape. The musketeers make friends. Later d‚ÄôArtagnan rescues Constance, a married seamstress for the Queen and they fall in love. On the next morning, D'Artagnan meets his friends at a local tavern and tells Athos that he mysteriously got a letter from Cardinal Richelieu, asking to meet with him after sunset. Athos tells D'Artagnan, that he has no choice but to meet with him. D'Artagnan that meets the Cardinal at his estate, who tries to sway him to his side with the promise of wealth, high ranking military career, and respect from the nobility. Although he declines the offer, Richelieu threatens and warns him what could happen if he continues to interfere with his plans. D'Artagnan returns to his friends, and tells them he refused to serve the Cardinal, and Athos advises D'Artagnan to be careful with his choices, now that he has made an enemy of Richelieu. Later at night, Richelieu meets with Milady Winter, one of his best spies and agents, and she tells him that the Duke of Beckingham has arrived in Paris. =Episode Two= After receiving word from Milady that the Duke has arrived in Paris, the Cardinal sends Rochefort and De Jussac to stop the Duke but it fails, and Rochefort tells him that D'Artagnan aided the Duke in escaping with the Queen's Diamond Studs, which the Queen gave the Duke, her lover, as a gift. Richelieu immediately plots his revenge on the Queen for rejecting him. He goes to her husband, King Louis XIII, whom he easily manipulates into holding a ball in the royal palace in 10 days, and he tells Louis to tell his wife to wear her diamond studs that Louis had prevousily given her as a present. Queen Anne, realizing she is in trouble from the Cardinal's wrath, she tells her loyal maid, Constance, to find someone to go to London and back in 10 days to deliver the studs. However, the Cardinal orders Rochefort to close all of France's ports until further notice. Constance recruits D'Artagnan and he recruits his friends and they sent out to London. However, De Jussac races to the port and deploys squads of Cardinal Guards across the countryside with a single order: Stop D'Artaganan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at any cost. Although D'Artagnan makes it past the blockade of guards, his friends stay behind to distract the guards. He then battles and defeats De Jussac, again, and steals the Cardinal's letter from him, allowing him to go to London from France's ports. Upon arriving, he discovers that 2 of the 12 diamond studs are stolen by Milady from the Duke. Milady arrives to Richelieu, giving him the studs, which he plans to use to extort the Queen, in return he gives Milady money, and a nobility title. D'Artaganan stays overnight in the Duke's palace, while the Duke orders his jeweler to make 2 new diamond studs to save Anne. The next day D'Artagnan races with the studs to France even riding overnight to desperately make it to Paris to save Constance's life from the Cardinal. He delivers the studs to the Queen saving her and Constance, but Richelieu sends Milady to capture Constance but it fails and she is forced to poison her. Constance dies, and D'Artagnan swears vengeance. =Episode Three= The Cardinal than manipulates Louis in declaring war on England. D'Artagnan is made a Musketeer and De Tr√©ville promises him the rank of lieutenant if D'Artagnan performs heroic deeds. The Siege of La Rochelle begins with King Louis personally being present and Cardinal Richelieu as Siege Commander. Meanwhile, the Cardinal and Milady orchestrate D'Artagnan's assassination, which fails and the assassin tells him the Milady hired him. D'Artagnan returns to their hotel and tells Athos about this, and Athos tells him the Milady is Lady Winter and she killed Constance. He also tells him the Tragic Story of Count De la F√®re who fell in love with Milady, only to discover that she is basically a prostitute who tricks guys and destroys their family honor, the enraged Count tried to kill her only to be almost killed by her, both though each other died. Due to Athos' anger and wrath while telling the tale, D'Artagnan figures out that Athos is Count De la F√®re. They then chase after Milady who tried to poison D'Artagnan, but fail. Athos knows that D'Artagnan is close to finding Milady so he and the rest of the Musketeers recruit a retired executioner whose family name was destroyed after Milady seduced his brother. They hunt down Milady and execute her, legally, because they confiscated Richelieu's letter, which allows someone to execute a person with the Cardinal's consent. After returning to the battlefield, they are arrested by Richelieu for Milady's murder, but he is forced to let them go after they show him his letter, allowing them to execute a person with his consent. Left with no other option, Richelieu offers to reward them by giving them the rank of lieutenant of the King's Musketeers, but the group say they are going to resign from service after the war, and the Richelieu should give it to D'Artagnan instead. Athos says to redeem themselves for leaving the battlefield, the 4 of them to hold of a fortress for an hour under fire without retreat to prove their loyalty to France. Richelieu agrees to give D'Artagnan the rank of lieutenant but only after they hold off the fortress for an hour, hoping that they would die. However, an hour passes, and the 4 musketeers return to camp being hailed as heroes by both the King's Musketeers and the Cardinal Guards. Richelieu, honoring his word, makes D'Artagnan lieutenant of the King's Musketeers.

It was the first news channel to broadcast its programming in Spanish and Portuguese languages to Latin America.  History  =Early years: 1994-96= Telemundo Group (then owned by investment firm Reliance Capital) announced that it would launch a 24-hour Spanish-language cable news channel that would be distributed in Latin America, Spain and the United States; at the time of the announcement, Telemundo was in the midst of negotiations with Reuters and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to become partners in the planned network, which it initially scheduled a target launch for later that year. Telemundo planned to use resources from Reuters Television and BBC World Service Television to provide content for international news stories, with BBC contributing its BBC Latin America Service's international newscasts and analysis programs. While the BBC ultimately did not partner in the network, Reuters (which acquired a 42% interest) would reach an agreement to develop the network with Telemundo (which also maintained a 42% stake). Three other media companies acquired interests in the new venture, Argentine publishing and broadcasting owner Grupo Clar√≠n (which owned 8%) and Spain-based Antena 3 (which owned the remaining 8%). On January 25, 1994, the partners announced that the service would be named Telenoticias. The network launched on December 1, 1994, becoming the third 24-hour news channel to serve Latin America that was headquartered in the region (Mexican giant Televisa's ECO was the first, launched in 1988; Canal de Noticias NBC, a venture launched by eventual Telemundo parent NBC on March 15, 1993, was the second, as it operated from the Charlotte, North Carolina facilities of the NBC News Channel affiliate video service). Telenoticias ‚Äì which broadcast its programming in Spanish and Portuguese ‚Äì was operated out of Telemundo's headquarters in the Miami suburb of Hialeah, Florida. In addition to distribution on cable and satellite television, some Telenoticias programming was also carried by television stations in certain U.S. markets, including KUBD (now Ion Television owned- and-operated station KPXC-TV) in Denver; WSNS-TV in Chicago (which otherwise operated as a Telemundo owned-and-operated station); and KQBN-LP (now Azteca affiliate KUDF-LP) in Tucson, Arizona. Anchors employed by the channel during this time included Marian de la Fuente, Jose Gray, Carlos Maria Ruiz, Rodrigo Vera, Pablo Gato and Susana Roza Vigil. =CBS ownership (1996‚Äì1998)= From the beginning, all five of the network's owners did not maintain a smooth relationship, disagreeing on Telenoticias' management and content; ultimately, the partners opted to sell of the network. In late June 1996, the companies sold Telenoticias to CBS, marking the company's first cable television venture since it ran the short-lived arts-oriented network CBS Cable (which it eventually named its new cable division) in the early 1980s. By this point, Telenoticias was available to 20 million households in 22 countries. Following the closure of the CBS purchase, the network was rebranded CBS Telenoticias on January 1, 1997. As part of the sale agreement, Telemundo entered into an agreement to outsource production responsibilities for the Telemundo network's national news program, Noticiero Telemundo, whose main anchor Raul Peimbert subsequently joined Telenoticias; the deal allowed CBS Telenoticias to produce the two weeknight-only newscasts, which aired at 6:30 and 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time (the latter having been moved into prime time as part of a programming realignment that removed an hour of telenovelas from the network's evening schedule to accommodate the move of local newscasts on Telemundo stations into the 10:00 p.m. hour), replacing an existing production agreement with CNN. The network also began utilizing resources from CBS Newspath to provide story content to supplement the newscasts, and based a small unit of reporters at the affiliate news service's headquarters in Washington, D.C. The network expanded its distribution into the United States in the fall of 1997, with the launch of a service that emphasized news content focusing on the United States, the Caribbean and Mexico that launched on the same date as CNN en Espa√±ol; the U.S. service featured two issues-focused talk shows, along with rolling newscasts. In late 1997, CBS Telenoticias began providing news programming content to Radio Unica, a radio network that launched in December of that year as the first nationally distributed Spanish-language radio network in the United States. =Launch in Brazil= The Portuguese language version debuted in October 1997 on the DirecTV Brasil line-up. Initially, it had about 12 hours of programming in Portuguese; the rest of the broadcast day was covered by CBS news programs. With the creation of the Portuguese language version of the channel, the cable operators NET and Multicanal, at the time owned by Grupo Globo, decided to remove the channel from their programming to avoid competition with GloboNews. In addition, the channel's launch was delayed several months as the satellite that was to transmit CBS Telenot√≠cias, PanAmSat 5 ‚Äì which went into orbit in August 1997 ‚Äì did not become fully operational until October 12, and cable providers obtained satellite receivers to receive the signal beamed from PanAmSat 5 later than expected. CBS Telenot√≠cias scored an early coup. Beginning on December 15, 1997, it took over production of Jornal do SBT, the main newscast of SBT. The Brazilian network and CBS, also began sharing content. Eliakim Ara√∫jo and Leila Cordeiro hosted the news program from Miami, while Hermano Henning hosted the program from the SBT studios, located in Osasco. This deal was similar to the Noticiero Telemundo production agreement. TVA (currently Vivo TV) began including the channel in their line-up from February 1, 1998 in their basic package. In March 1998, SBT started to broadcast five hours of programming from CBS Telenot√≠cias through the night, known as SINAL (Sistema de Not√≠cias da Am√©rica Latina; Latin American News System in English). Telenot√≠cias also established content sharing partnerships with Band and TV Cultura, but their contributions could not be shown on SBT. =Bankruptcy, and sales to Grupo Medcom and Telemundo (1998‚Äì2000)= During the first quarter of 1998 alone, Telenoticias and fellow CBS Cable-owned channel Eye on People lost a combined $9 million in revenue. In late 1998, CBS sold a 70% interest in the channel to Mexican-based Grupo Medcom, a concern operated by the Serna family; under the deal, CBS continued to provide news content resources through CBS Newspath (CBS also sold its stake in Eye on People to Discovery Communications, which subsequently rebranded the network as Discovery People). Financial problems ultimately trickled into Telenoticias' operations; as a result, CBS Telenoticias stopped producing Jornal do SBT in early 1999 (with SBT continuing to produce the program in-house until it ended in 2016). However, in July 1999, the network's financial problems got even worse; some of the telephones at one of the network's news bureaus were disconnected, employees received salary paychecks later than scheduled, and reimbursements were never paid out. By the end of that month, CBS Telenoticias laid off 77 staffers; several days later, the network filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite the filing, the network gained affiliations with a few low-power television stations, such as K19BW (now KLEG-CD) in Dallas. CBS sold its stake in Telenoticias to Sony Pictures Entertainment and Liberty Media in February 2000 for $2.35 million; the deal was approved in federal bankruptcy court, placing Telenoticias back under the auspices of Telemundo, which Sony and Liberty acquired months after Telenoticias' sale to CBS. The channel ultimately ceased operations on March 1, 2000. The Portuguese language division was dissolved as part of an agreement between Telemundo and Rede Globo to broadcast its telenovelas, and the Spanish-language channel would be replaced by the international version of Telemundo.

The nitrogen-15 dimension is perpendicular to the screen. Each window is focused on the nitrogen chemical shift of that amino acid. The sequential assignment is made by matching the alpha carbon chemical shifts. HNCA is a 3D triple-resonance NMR experiment commonly used in the field of protein NMR. The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an amino acid residue is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary HNCOCA experiment transfers magnetization only to the alpha carbon of the previous residue. The HNCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCOCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with 13C and 15N isotopic labelling, at a concentration greater than 0.1 mM, and is thus generally only applied to recombinant proteins. The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a 15N axis and a 13C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {HN(i), N(i), Calpha (i)} and {HN(i), N(i), Calpha(i-1)}, while for the complementary HNCOCA experiment peaks appear only at {HN(i), N(i), Calpha(i-1)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

History Les Cl√©es is first mentioned in 1134 as Clees. Above the village are the remains of the castle. The keep was restored in the 19th Century, but the rest of castle remained in ruins. During the Middle Ages was a city that was granted numerous freedoms in 1272 by the Count of Savoy. It owed its prosperity to the traffic through the Jougne Pass and the tolls that the castle collected on the pass road. Starting in 1536 it belonged to the bailiwick of Yverdon. The city was the center of the Les Cl√©es district or bailiwick, which also included another eight villages. From the 15th Century until 1566, the Vall√©e de Joux also belonged to the district. In 1134, Pope Innocent II tried in vain to prohibit the reconstruction of the castle. In 1232, Hugo IV, the Duke of Burgundy granted the district to Guillaume II, the Count of Geneva. The Duke of Burgundy also transferred the feudal rights over the district to Jean Chalon in 1237, who was unable to maintain these rights. renounced the feudal rule and transferred them to, who could not be sustained. The Count of Geneva then held these rights until he was forced to give them up in 1260, following his defeat by Peter of Savoy. In 1272, Count Philip I of Savoy and the dean of Romainm√¥tier entered into a contract, which granted the protection of the monastery and its lands to the castle of Les Cl√©es. The subjects of the provost had to pay for a tax for this privilege, which continued until 1798. During the Burgundian War, on 22 October 1475, Swiss Confederation troops seized and destroyed the city and castle and killed the castle garrison. Under Bernese rule there were three courts in the Les Cl√©es district, one of which was held in the city. Nevertheless, the city gradually lost importance. The chapel of Les Cl√©es was built before the 14th Century. It was a filial church of the parish of Lignerolle and remained under it even after the Protestant Reformation. The chapel was rebuilt in 1738‚Äì1740. From the end of the 15th Century until the beginning of the 18th Century there was a furnace and a pig iron smelting operation in the village.

B√© Binn, in modern orthography B√©ibhinn, is an early Irish personal and mythological name. In some sources B√©·∏Éinn is a goddess associated with birth and the sister of the river-goddess, Boann. B√©·∏Éinn is also described as being an underworld goddess in both Irish and Welsh mythology, inhabiting either the Irish underworld Mag Mell or the Welsh Annwn, although it is unknown which is the original source.MacKillop, James (1998) A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology. Oxford, Oxford University Press. p.37 Etymology and variations The name B√©·∏Éinn seems to be a combination between medieval forms of the Irish Gaelic word for \\"woman\\", \\"bean\\" (pronounced \\"bahn\\"), and the adjective \\"melodious\\", \\"binn\\", literally translating to \\"melodious woman\\". Other versions of the name, such as B√©fionn, instead pair \\"woman\\" with \\"fair\\". Variant forms include B√© Bind, B√© Find, B√© Binn, Bebhinn, B√©bhinn, B√©bh√≠nn, B√©bhionn, B√©ibhionn, B√©·∏Éind, B√©find and B√©fionn. While it has also been Anglicized as Vivionn and Vivian, it is unrelated to the French or English names. In eighteenth-century Scottish writer James Macpherson's epic Ossian poems, the name appears as Vevina.Sheard, K. M. (2011) Llewellyn's Complete Book of Names. Woodbury, Minnesota: Llewellyn Publications. p.96Yonge, Charlotte Mary (1863) History of Christian Names. London: Parker, Son, and Bourne. In the Irish Annals, the name appears as, { ! !!

One word - ! lenition noted  Be Bhinn, B√© Bhind  B√©bhinn, Bebhinn, Beuynn, Bevin - ! not noted  Be Binn, Be Bind  B√©binn, Bebinn, Bebind } It is recorded from the decades around the year 1100 and again around 1400. In mythology B√©·∏Éinn is alternately described as either the wife of √Åed Alainn, a god, or Idath, a mortal man. She is mentioned in multiple sources as the mother of Connacht hero Fr√°ech, the main character in the T√°in B√≥ Fra√≠ch. In the Fenian Cycle of Irish tales, B√©·∏Éinn is \\"a beautiful giantess of aristocratic bearing\\" who seeks protection from the Fianna when an ugly giant pursues her. In other sources a B√©·∏Éinn is mentioned as a daughter of Elcmar. The epithet B√© Find (\\"Fair Woman\\") is applied to the heroine √âta√≠n by Midir in Tochmarc √âta√≠ne (). The text includes a poem attributed to Midir, known as \\"A B√© Find in ragha lium\\". However, this poem may be an older composition unrelated to the √âta√≠n story that was appended at a later time.Mac Cana, Proinsias (1989) \\"Notes on the Combination of Prose and Verse in Early Irish Narrative\\".

Powers and abilities Ben's abilities are pyrokinesis, enabling him to produce and manipulate flame. In addition, he is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures. As a side effect of his powers, Ben's head remains constantly aflame, though it appears that he can control the extent of the flaming; during a Danger Room session, he is able to maintain some level of stealth by lowering the intensity of his head flame. Ben's body is always glowing, and emits heat, however it is not hot enough to burn his clothing. The flame on his head is also not as hot as normal fire and as such, it does not burn what it touches. This was confirmed by his creators, Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir. In other media Match briefly appears in Dark Phoenix portrayed by Lamar Johnson.

The nitrogen-15 dimension is perpendicular to the screen. Each window is focused on the nitrogen chemical shift of that amino acid. The sequential assignment is made by matching the alpha carbon chemical shifts. HNCOCA is a 3D triple-resonance NMR experiment commonly used in the field of protein NMR. The name derives from the experiment's magnetization transfer pathway: The magnetization of the amide proton of an amino acid residue is transferred to the amide nitrogen, and then to the alpha carbon of the previous residue in the protein's amino acid sequence. In contrast, the complementary HNCA experiment transfers magnetization to the alpha carbons of both the starting residue and the previous residue in the sequence. The HNCOCA experiment is used, often in tandem with HNCA, to assign alpha carbon resonance signals to specific residues in the protein. This experiment requires a purified sample of protein prepared with 13C and 15N isotopic labelling, at a concentration greater than 0.1 mM, and is thus generally only applied to recombinant proteins. The spectrum produced by this experiment has 3 dimensions: A proton axis, a 15N axis and a 13C axis. For residue i peaks will appear at {HN(i), N(i), CŒ±(i-1)} only, while for the complementary HNCA experiment peaks appear at {HN(i), N(i), CŒ±(i-1)} and {HN(i), N(i), CŒ± (i)}. Together, these two experiments reveal the alpha carbon chemical shift for each amino acid residue in a protein, and provide information linking adjacent residues in the protein's sequence.

Fictional history Necroplasm was originally indistinct/synonymous with psychoplasm, the substance of which Hell itself is composed. It is similar in properties, but special in that it can exist on Earth without needing to remain in one of Hell's spheres of influence as well as being allowed to traverse the mortal world without violating the non-aggression pact between Heaven and Hell. Necroplasm was a creation of the Grand-Mal Demon known as Leviathan and is exclusive to the 8th Sphere of Hell. He used it to create a demon in his own image, known as The Malebolgia (Mal), who turned on his master and usurped the 8th Sphere for his own. This gave Malebolgia full control over the necroplasmic reserves and thus the ability to create a unique army of warriors known as Hellspawn which he uses to tip the balance of power in Hell toward the 8th Sphere. All Hellspawns in Todd McFarlane's Spawn comic book series (and other media) are entirely composed of this substance. Necroplasm is one way that the otherworldly material of Hell may manifest physically in the real world of Earth. The main character of the series, Spawn (Al Simmons), wears a suit that is itself necroplasm-based and interacts with his fully necroplasmic body. It alters his physical appearance and allows him to use his body as a living weapon by endowing him with superhuman powers of strength, bodily density and weight, healing factor, and metabolism. The suit is a living symbiotic organism which provides him with various powers and great protection. He can also shoot beams of green necroplasmic energy from his body. Additionally, both his blood and eyes glow with the same green light, and also many of his magics, suggesting that raw necroplasm glows green. Hellspawn are created with a limited amount of energy contained within their necroplasm, measured as 9,999 units to begin with. Once this energy is consumed, their time on Earth ends and the Hellspawn returns to Hell, his soul forfeit. The substance is also referenced in the Image Comics/Top Cow Productions comic series The Darkness and was seen in the Medieval Spawn/Witchblade crossover.The DARKNESS Vol.1, #38MEDIEVAL SPAWN / WITCHBLADE Vol.1, #1 Etymology The prefix necro- means \\"dead.\\" It has its origin in the Greek nekro-, a combining form of nekr√≥s, meaning \\"dead person\\", \\"corpse\\", or \\"dead\\". The root -plasm describes the material forming cells or tissue. It comes from the Greek plasma, meaning \\"something molded or formed\\". Thus, Necroplasm probably means \\"dead cells\\" or \\"formed of dead tissue.\\" The word is a play on the term ectoplasm, which denotes a substance or spiritual energy that is \\"exteriorized\\" by physical mediums and said to be associated with the formation of ghosts.

Abilities include radiation emission as heat, \\"hard\\" radiation (inflicting opponents with nausea, dizziness, and radiation poisoning), and hypnotic light. He can also absorb nuclear radiation without harm and convert it to energy for personal use such as strength enhancement or to cauterize wounds, create force fields, and emit electromagnetic radiation to deactivate machinery. He has shown the ability to leave behind \\"radiation pills\\", i.e. infusing a single individual with enough radiation to give him severe radiation poisoning and let the contamination spread in a large population. While it was briefly implied that his radioactive makeup along with some further enhancements of his powers had left him radioactive and unable to have contact with unshielded people, he was retconned to have always been in full control of his abilities. Even so, during his tenure in the Dark Avengers, Norman Osborn had his original costume replaced with a customized radiation suit, hiding his Asian features and quelling every lingering fear about his radioactive makeup.

(born 1934) is an American Catholic priest, Jesuit, and theologian who served as the president of Georgetown University from 1989 to 2001. Born in New York City, he graduated from Georgetown, and while studying in France, decided to enter the Society of Jesus. He went on to receive advanced degrees from Fordham University and Woodstock College, and received his doctorate in theology from the University of M√ºnster, where he studied under Karl Rahner. Upon returning to the United States, he became a professor at Woodstock College and the Weston Jesuit School of Theology, before becoming a senior administrator in the Jesuit Maryland Province. In 1989, O'Donovan was named the president of Georgetown University. His administration saw a significant improvement of the university's finances, which included tripling its endowment and selling the university hospital, which was in substantial debt. He also instituted an architectural master plan for the campus, and reorganized several academic components of the university. The number of applications for admission increased, and Georgetown became among the most selective universities in the country. At the same time, the faculty, administration, and student body became increasingly diverse. His tenure was not without controversy, as he was ordered by a Vatican ecclesiastical court to withdraw funding for a student abortion rights group. He also became a director of The Walt Disney Company in 1996. Following the end of his presidency in 2001, O'Donovan returned to teaching, continuing to do so until 2013. He has remained active in national higher education organizations, and in 2016, became the director of mission for the Jesuit Refugee Service USA.  Early life  Leo Jeremiah O'Donovan III was born in 1934 to Margaret and Leo J. O'Donovan Jr. in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens, in New York City, New York. Growing up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, his family belonged to Corpus Christi Church in Morningside Heights and O'Donovan attended the Corpus Christi School, where he was educated by the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters. For high school, he attended Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, New York, graduating in 1952. O'Donovan enrolled at Georgetown University with the intention of becoming a psychiatrist. However, halfway through his undergraduate studies, he quit the pre-med program, and double-majored in English and philosophy. While at Georgetown, he wrote for the student newspaper, The Hoya, and was editor-in-chief of the Georgetown College Journal. He graduated summa cum laude and first in his class in 1956. O'Donovan received a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Lyon in France, where he decided to enter the Society of Jesus in 1957. He also received a Danforth Fellowship. Upon his return to the United States, he went to Fordham University, receiving a Licentiate of Philosophy. He then studied at Woodstock College in Maryland, earning a Bachelor of Sacred Theology and Licentiate of Sacred Theology. He was ordained a priest there in 1966. Following his ordination, he went to the University of M√ºnster in West Germany. Studying under the Jesuit theologian Karl Rahner, he received his Doctor of Theology degree in 1971. He then spent time at the University of Chicago Divinity School as a post-doctoral scholar.  Academic career  In 1971, O'Donovan became an assistant professor of theology at Woodstock College, then located in New York City. After three years, he left to become a professor of theology at the Weston Jesuit School of Theology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, specializing in systematic theology. While there, he professed his final vows in 1977. From 1981 to 1982, O'Donovan served as the president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. He took a leave of absence from 1985 to 1988, during which time he was the provincial assistant for formation for the Jesuit Maryland Province. He then returned to Weston as professor for an additional year.  Georgetown University  O'Donovan with Ambassador alt=Leo J. O'Donovan, Hendrik Jan Jurriaan Schuwer, and Katrina Swett O'Donovan was appointed the president of Georgetown University, and assumed office on September 23, 1989. Succeeding Timothy S. Healy, he was the first alumnus of Georgetown to be named president since Alphonsus J. Donlon, whose presidency began in 1912. Several academic components were reorganized during O'Donovan's tenure. In 1994, under the provost's direction, the School of Languages and Linguistics was subsumed into Georgetown College, with the exception of its linguistics faculty, which became part of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. The departments of economics, history, and government were also relocated from the School of Foreign Service to Georgetown College. O'Donovan devised a new master plan for the university's physical campus, which had undergone rapid and often haphazard growth during the previous two decades. The plan called for all new buildings to be architecturally cohesive with that of the historic portion of campus and the surrounding Georgetown neighborhood. While no new buildings were constructed during his presidency, planning for the construction of the Southwest Quadrangle, which included a large dormitory, dining hall, parking garage, and new Jesuit residence, began. Instead, funds were allocated to the refurbishment of existing buildings that had deteriorated from neglect of maintenance during the same 20 years. As under his predecessor, the size of the faculty continued to increase, contrary to a national trend of shrinking faculty sizes. At the same time, the percentage of faculty who were women or racial minorities increased, and women came to hold many of the university's most senior administrative positions. = Academic growth = Georgetown University Hospital to MedStar Health in 2000.alt=Main building of the Georgetown University Hospital in winter The caliber of students admitted to Georgetown continued to increase during this time. The number of applications grew steadily, and the university's admissions rate declined from 29% in 1991 to 21% in 2001, joining the ranks of the most highly selective universities in the country. At the same time, the classes of entering students grew increasingly geographically and ethnically diverse. Having undergone unprecedented growth during the latter half of the 20th century, the university convened an exploration of its identity, particularly in regard to its Catholic and Jesuit nature. After several years, the task force resolved in 2000 that its Catholic and Jesuit heritage was core to the university's identity. Funding for research more than doubled as the university saw increased grant awards, primarily to the medical center. In addition, numerous centers and institutes were created during O'Donovan's presidency, including he Georgetown Public Policy Institute in 1990, which would become the McCourt School of Public Policy in 2013, following a gift of $100 million from Frank McCourt, equivalent to $ in . Another such institute was the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, which was founded in 1993, and renamed in 2006 for Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, in recognition of a $20 million gift from the Saudi royal, equivalent to $ in . O'Donovan also significantly improved the university's financial situation, with the endowment tripling from $240 million to $740 million over the course of his tenure, equivalent to $ and $, respectively, in . After several years of increasing deficits, O'Donovan decided to sell a controlling interest in the Georgetown University Hospital to MedStar Health in 2000. Under the agreement, MedStar assumed the hospital's $80 million in debt, in exchange for assuming control of the hospital's operations and its 4,000 employees. Georgetown retained ownership of medical and nursing schools, as well as their research programs. = Campus cultural conflicts = One controversy that arose during O'Donovan's presidency concerned the funding and official recognition of an abortion rights student group. In 1991, the university had decided to fund the group, on the grounds that it would be an informational rather than advocacy organization. This prompted strong condemnation from the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal James Hickey, and a group of alumni, who brought a canon lawsuit against the university. In April 1992, the suit was heard at the Vatican, which ruled that the university must immediately end funding of the group. The university revoked the group's funding, and while it denied that its decision was due to the court order, a high-ranking Jesuit was soon sent to campus to ensure that O'Donovan complied with the ruling. O'Donovan also drew criticism for his decisions to allow speakers such as Larry Flynt on campus, and to permit the university to perform fetal tissue research. In 1996, O'Donovan was appointed to the board of directors of The Walt Disney Company. The selection of a priest to be a director of a major American corporation was highly unusual. His appointment came at a time when Disney was facing criticism from religious organizations, such as the Southern Baptist Convention‚Äîfor hosting gay and lesbian theme nights‚Äîand the Catholic League‚Äîfor distributing a movie that sympathetically portrayed a homosexual Catholic priest. While some speculated that his appointment was a public relations move by Disney to allay the concerns of religious groups, both O'Donovan and Michael Eisner, the CEO of Disney, denied that this was the reason for his appointment. Eisner, who also served on Georgetown's board of directors and whose son was a student at Georgetown at the time, stated that he had intended to appoint O'Donovan to the board before the start of any controversy, and made the appointment once a seat opened up. O'Donovan's tenure as president came to an end in 2001, and he was succeeded by John J. DeGioia. Upon stepping down, he received the university's highest award, the John Carroll Award.  Later career  O'Donovan with former Secretary of State alt=Leo J. O'Donovan and Madeleine Albright at the Dutch Embassy, Washington, D.C. After leaving Georgetown, O'Donovan returned to teaching and scholarship. In 2003, Georgetown University's new dining hall was named the Leo J. O'Donovan Dining Hall. He became a visiting professor at Fordham University and the General Theological Seminary, teaching until 2013. In 2006, he was a BMW Distinguished Visitor at the American Academy in Berlin. From 2008 to 2009, he was also a visiting professor at the Union Theological Seminary. In 2009, he became the co-chair of the St. Claude La Colombi√®re Jesuit Community campaign. He then returned to Georgetown University as a professor of theology. In 2014, The Leo J. O'Donovan Fund for Jesuit Education, which seeks to support the formation of young Jesuits, was established. In 2016, he became the director of mission for the Jesuit Refugee Service USA. In this capacity, he wrote about his opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, particularly with regard to Muslim immigration. In addition to his work with the Jesuit Refugee Service, O'Donovan has been a member of numerous organizations and committees. He served on the Special Commission on the Religious Life of Undergraduates at Yale University, which was convened by Yale president Rick Levin, as well as on the Blue Ribbon Committee on the Future of the Public Library of Washington, D.C., which was convened by Mayor Anthony Williams. O'Donovan has also served on the boards of the College of New Rochelle, Fidelis Health Care New York, Jesuit Volunteers International, and was chairman of the Corpus Christi School. He has also been a member of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, a member of the steering committee of presidents for the America Reads Initiative, the chair of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education, and was a member of the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts. O'Donovan has received the Knight Commanders Cross with star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Jewish National Fund Tree of Life Award. He has also received four honorary degrees.

In the 1930 season, he did even better and was the season‚Äôs third-highest wicket-taker behind only incomparable county bowlers Tich Freeman and Charlie Parker. In 1931, Mitchell achieved the amazing feat of taking twelve wickets for thirty runs against a strong Sussex eleven ‚Äì featuring that brilliant player of spin bowling Duleepsinhji at his best ‚Äì on a pitch too wet to take much spin.

Indeed, he was so expensive when called upon in 1934 that he took no wicket and conceded 117 runs, and the following year, when he was very disappointing on a leatherjacket-infested Lord's wicket that should have helped him, he is quoted as having said \\"You couldn't captain a team of bloody lead soldiers\\" to his captain Bob Wyatt.Engel, Matthew S. (editor); Wisden Cricketers‚Äô Almanack, 134th Edition (1997), pp. 1410-1411 Indeed, Mitchell's tactlessness towards administrators made him quite unpopular with them and may have prejudiced his chances of doing well in representative cricket. However, for Derbyshire Mitchell went from strength to strength in the dry summers of 1933 and 1934, at times bowling with sensational skill, as when he dismissed Worcestershire for 48 on a good pitch in 1934.Southerton (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketer‚Äôs Almanack, (1935), part ii, p. 442 He was close to the top of the averages in those two seasons, but from the 1935 season appeared to sacrifice length to gain more spin and often suffered heavy punishment.Brookes, Wilfrid H. (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketer‚Äôs Almanack, Seventy-Third Edition (1936), part ii, p. 130 That year, he was offered terms by Lancashire League club Colne,‚ÄòDerbyshire May Lose Mitchell‚Äô; The Scotsman, 21 August 1935, p. 16 but decided to remain with Derbyshire. Still, he could be deadly on his best days, as when he took all ten wickets in an innings against Leicestershire for 64 runs at Leicester in 1935 or when he took 7 for 26 against Gloucestershire on a blameless pitch at Derby a year later.‚ÄòSix Wickets for 9 Runs: Mitchell‚Äôs Fine Bowling Spell in Derby-Gloucester Game‚Äô; The Scotsman, 11 June 1936, p. 17 Mitchell set a record for Derbyshire with 168 wickets in 1935, but in Derbyshire‚Äôs Championship win in the 1936 season he was considerably less successful and at times very expensive even when conditions favoured bowlers (e.g. against Kent at Burton-on-Trent and Warwickshire at Edgbaston). Still, on Mitchell's good days Derbyshire's bowling that season could compare with almost any county side in history, and the following two seasons still saw him as one of the best spin bowlers in England. In the 1939 season, however, Mitchell did not do much work because Derbyshire's pace attack was so consistently effective and he failed to take 100 wickets for the first time in eleven seasons. During World War II Mitchell played for Lidget Green in the Bradford League, but when he refused to rejoin Derbyshire due to his engagements in League cricket, the Derbyshire committee declined to give Mitchell the benefit he had been due to receive in 1940. He did, though, continue to baffle batsmen for Hickleton Main well into his fifties. At his best a master of flight and variety,Robertson-Glasgow, R.C.; The Cricket Writings of R.C. Robertson-Glasgow, p. 153 Mitchell was capable of many more balls than the typical leg-break and googly bowler, perhaps because he learned his art in an unusual way from spinning a billiard ball.‚ÄòCurrent Comment: A Spin Bowler Learns His Art from Billiards‚Äô; South China Morning Post, 14 December 1932, p. 6 Often he would vary his leg-breaks with off-breaks made by turning the wrist in the opposite direction to that of a conventional leg-break or googly,Robertson-Glasgow; The Cricket Writings of R.C. Robertson-Glasgow, p. 154 and his top-spinner also brought him many wickets. However, Mitchell, unlike such bowlers as Tich Freeman, was erratic and, especially in his later years, he could have days where he was heaven for batsmen wishing for quick runs. He was never much of a batsman, but was a capable field at cover-point. When he died at Hickleton, Doncaster, Yorkshire, Mitchell was the oldest surviving English Test cricketer and was surrounded by great-grandchildren, seemingly contented in a way not seen in his days as a player.

In the simplest cases, a pre-existing set of data is considered. However, the task can also involve the design of experiments such that the data collected is well-suited to the problem of model selection. Given candidate models of similar predictive or explanatory power, the simplest model is most likely to be the best choice (Occam's razor). state, \\"The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling\\". Relatedly, has said, \\"How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis\\". Model selection may also refer to the problem of selecting a few representative models from a large set of computational models for the purpose of decision making or optimization under uncertainty. Introduction The scientific observation cycle. In its most basic forms, model selection is one of the fundamental tasks of scientific inquiry. Determining the principle that explains a series of observations is often linked directly to a mathematical model predicting those observations. For example, when Galileo performed his inclined plane experiments, he demonstrated that the motion of the balls fitted the parabola predicted by his model . Of the countless number of possible mechanisms and processes that could have produced the data, how can one even begin to choose the best model? The mathematical approach commonly taken decides among a set of candidate models; this set must be chosen by the researcher. Often simple models such as polynomials are used, at least initially . emphasize throughout their book the importance of choosing models based on sound scientific principles, such as understanding of the phenomenological processes or mechanisms (e.g., chemical reactions) underlying the data. Once the set of candidate models has been chosen, the statistical analysis allows us to select the best of these models. What is meant by best is controversial. A good model selection technique will balance goodness of fit with simplicity . More complex models will be better able to adapt their shape to fit the data (for example, a fifth-order polynomial can exactly fit six points), but the additional parameters may not represent anything useful. (Perhaps those six points are really just randomly distributed about a straight line.) Goodness of fit is generally determined using a likelihood ratio approach, or an approximation of this, leading to a chi-squared test. The complexity is generally measured by counting the number of parameters in the model. Model selection techniques can be considered as estimators of some physical quantity, such as the probability of the model producing the given data. The bias and variance are both important measures of the quality of this estimator; efficiency is also often considered. A standard example of model selection is that of curve fitting, where, given a set of points and other background knowledge (e.g. points are a result of i.i.d. samples), we must select a curve that describes the function that generated the points. Methods to assist in choosing the set of candidate models *Data transformation (statistics) *Exploratory data analysis *Model specification *Scientific method Criteria Below is a list of criteria for model selection.

He was one of Wisden 's five Cricketers of the Year in 1937. Life and career Charlie Barnett came from a well-known Gloucestershire cricketing family ‚Äì his father (C. S.) and two uncles all played for the county, as amateurs ‚Äì and after going to Wycliffe College Stonehouse he began as an amateur (against Cambridge in 1927, when he was 16). Although he turned professional in 1929. One of the most stylish batsman of the 1930s, Barnett began his career in the middle order for Gloucestershire, but made his name as an opener after the retirement of A.E. Dipper in 1932. The greater responsibility added a tighter defence to his flashing array of drives and cuts, and he was picked for England against the West Indies in 1933. He marked his debut with a half century, batting at number 8, and passed 2,000 runs for the season. Although he remained vulnerable to an early dismissal, once set he was a formidable player and he recorded 48 centuries in all. Eleven sixes in an innings of 194 against Somerset in 1934, stands as a testament to the power of his stroke play. He failed to pass 1,500 runs in only two seasons, and gradually developed his left arm medium pace bowling, as a useful adjunct to his batting. Barnett scored two Test centuries, putting on 219 for the first wicket with Len Hutton against Australia at Trent Bridge in 1938, as England compiled 658 for eight. His undefeated 98 before lunch on the first day of that Ashes series, remains the closest any Englishman has ever come to recording a century before lunch, on the first day of a Test match against Australia. However his career, like so many others, was stymied by World War II. He returned after the war in four more tests with little success, and retired from the county game to take up a league engagement for Rochdale, and later ran his own meat and poultry business. He became a school coach until his retirement, and died in a Stroud Glos nursing home in May 1993, at the age of 82.

He was born at Blackheath, London and died at Otford, Kent. Although he played only seven tests, his Test batting average of 64.85, including two centuries and one fifty, is twice his overall first-class record of 30.15 with 35 centuries and 90 fifties in 399 first-class matches. He played in just two Test series, scoring 179 runs in two tests against India on the 1933/34 tour with a best of 136 in less than 3 hours on debut in Bombay. He amassed 275 runs in 5 matches against South Africa on the 1938/39 MCC tour, including a score of 112 in 2 hours, 40 minutes in Cape Town in the Second Test of the series. His final Test was the famous 'timeless test' in Durban which saw England's last innings cut short at 654/5 when they were forced to catch the boat home after 10 days of cricket. Valentine ended the match on 4 not out. Valentine was educated at Repton School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He represented Cambridge University at cricket in 1928 and 1929, and also won a Blue for soccer. His long career at Kent County Cricket Club as a right-handed batsman and occasional medium pacer spanned two decades from 1927 to 1948. He was awarded his Kent cap in 1931 and captained the county on occasion during the 1930s in the absence of Percy Chapman; in 1937 he shared the captaincy with Ronnie Bryan. Following Gerry Chalk's death in World War II Valentine captained Kent again between 1946 and 1948 before being succeeded by David Clark. An attacking batsman whose defence improved with experience in the first-class arena, he was particularly strong through the leg side but his Test appearances were limited by the strength of the England team at the time. His highest score, 242, was made for Kent against Leicestershire at Oakham in 1938. A limited bowler, he was an excellent all round fielder equally home in the covers or catching close to the wicket. During World War II Valentine served with the Royal West Kent Regiment and was awarded the Military Cross \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North Africa\\". He returned to cricket despite being badly wounded during hostilities. He was President of Kent County Cricket Club in 1967 and served on the cricket committee for many years. His sister, Carol, has also played test cricket for England.

He played in fifteen Tests from 1934 to 1939. Farnes was born in Leytonstone, Essex, and was educated at the Royal Liberty School in Gidea Park. He made his first-class debut for Essex in 1930, aged only 19. He took 5-36 in his second county match against Kent. He studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge, playing cricket in the University side for three years while also continuing to play for Essex. After graduating, he became a teacher at Worksop College, which limited his opportunity to play for Essex. Farnes was reduced to tears in 1932, playing against Yorkshire at Scarborough. Earlier that year, playing at Leyton, Yorkshire had beaten Essex by an innings and 313 runs. Farnes reinforced Essex for the return match. Bowling as fast as he could, he conceded 75 runs to Herbert Sutcliffe and Maurice Leyland in 4 overs, and Essex lost again by an innings and 8 runs. In 1933, he took 41 wickets for Cambridge at a bowling average of 17.39 runs; in all, he took 113 wickets at an average of 18.38 that year. He was called up for the 1st Test against Australia in 1934, at Trent Bridge, taking 5-102 and 5-77, although England lost by 238 runs. He also played in the 2nd Test at Lord's, but was then injured, missing the next two Tests and only playing again towards the end of the season. After two further Tests on the tour to the West Indies in 1934/35, an injury to his knee prevented him from playing in 1935. The next season, playing for the Gentlemen against the Players, he took three quick wickets, bowling Gimblett, Hammond and Hardstaff, to leave the Players at 33-4. Although rain intervened, so the match was drawn, Gubby Allen selected him for the tour to Australia that winter, where he played in the 4th and 5th Tests. His 6-96 in the 5th Test at the MCG could not prevent Australia scoring 604 in their first innings, and so winning the match by an innings and 200 to take the series 3-2. In 1938, Farnes bowled the Gentlemen to their second victory against the Players since 1918, taking 8-43 and 3-60, and he returned to the Test side for 4 Tests against Australia in 1938, and he toured South Africa that winter, opening the bowling in five Tests with Hedley Verity. A tall man of 6'5\\", and widely recognised for his fitness, he achieved considerable pace from a short run-up, and sharp lift from a good length. His height also enabled him to take many sharp catches close to the stumps. He was a confirmed tail-ender as a batsman. He achieved his highest first-class score of 97 not out against Somerset at Taunton in 1936, putting on 149 for the tenth wicket and just missing out on his century. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1939, and published an autobiography, Tours and Tests in 1940. Military career and death He joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in the Second World War, and trained in Canada. He was a sergeant prior to being commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 September 1941. He died shortly after returning to England, when the Vickers Wellington that he was flying crashed after takeoff from RAF Chipping Warden in Oxfordshire during a night-flying exercise, killing Farnes and Pilot Officer Cecil Hayes.

One person was injured and a number of buildings and roads in Kythira were heavily damaged as a result. Several older houses on the island completely collapsed while the central square of the village of Mitata partially fell into the valley as a result of a subsequent landslide.

Damage to 146 buildings was recorded in western Crete, including the old town hall of Chania, the third Venetian arsenal, nine schools and many of the houses in the old Venetian town center. Nevertheless, despite the magnitude and the duration of the tremor (buildings in Athens swayed for almost 40 seconds) no other significant injury or damage was reported in the country's strongest earthquake in decades.

During this period he was an effective if unattractive all-rounder and played twice for England, though he failed to make any impact in either game with bat or ball.  Biography  Born 30 October 1903, Newton, Hyde, Cheshire, Hopwood began playing for Lancashire in the 1920s as a solid right-hand batsman, but after playing fairly often for the first team in 1924 and 1925 he dropped out until 1928. In that year, however, he helped the team to their finest record ever in the County Championship with a number of surprising performances as an accurate left arm spinner, the best of which was nine for 74 against Middlesex, five for 71 against Derbyshire and six for 20 against Wales. He also hit a century against Worcestershire. 1929 saw Hopwood establish a regular place he held until the war and with Hallows declining and rule changes reducing what had previously been remarkable run-scoring, he became of great value to the team even if he was very slow and ungraceful with a backlift consistently compared with Bill Woodfull. 1930 saw Lancashire return to the top of the table and Hopwood had a major role with 949 runs and 63 wickets. His best figures were five for 18 against Essex at Leyton and five for 40 against Northamptonshire at Old Trafford. The next two years were ordinary, but in the dry summer of 1933 Hopwood suddenly jumped to the top of the tree, scoring over 1,900 runs and revealing himself one of the soundest and most patient opening batsmen in the game. Late in the season he confirmed his skill as a bowler by taking eleven wickets on a good pitch against Middlesex and then completing the match double against Leicestershire with a return of nine for 33, which was a surprising leap from his previous best 7 for 91. Although Hopwood had been prior to that used mainly as a defensive bowler with six men on the leg side, this match showed he could be as deadly as Verity on a sticky pitch. 1934 was Hopwood's greatest year, however. His batting was not quite so good as in 1933, but with 220 against Gloucestershire and his skill as a bowler he was seen as too good to miss a place in the Test team. However, with the likes of C.F. Walters and the incomparable Herbert Sutcliffe to fill Hopwood's natural place as an opener, there was little hope he would be successful trying to play a game foreign to his nature. As for his bowling, nobody believed he could get wickets against batsmen with the superlative footwork of Bradman, Kippax or Ponsford on good pitches, whilst on bad pitches Verity would ‚Äì as at Lord's ‚Äì do everything that was required. Thus it was unsurprising when Hopwood scored only twelve runs in two innings and set a record for bowling the most balls in Test cricket (462) without taking a wicket.. His economy in the Old Trafford Test on a featherbed pitch, however, drew praise form the critics even if it was clear he did not have Verity's cleverness. Nonetheless, for Lancashire Hopwood had three deadly matches on worn or sticky pitches: * nine for 69 and six for 43 against Worcestershire ** on a pitch that crumbled * seven for 13 and five for 55 against Glamorgan * five for 32 and eight for 58 against Derbyshire ** both on rain-affected wickets that were rare in a dry summer 1935 saw Hopwood maintain his all-round form and do the \\"double\\" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the second successive year, but after a few good performances early in 1936 his bowling declined severely. Hopwood did maintain his batting until the war despite dropping down the order, but by 1937 his spin and accuracy as a bowler had completely gone ‚Äì a savage loss for Lancashire who had a high frequency of rainy weather and wet wickets that required a spin bowler of the standard Hopwood was at between late 1933 and the end of 1935. Though aged forty-three, Hopwood intended to resume his career after the war but a major illness put paid to such ambitions. He died 15 June 1985, Denton near Manchester.Len Hopwood.

She entered the harem of Sultan Murad II of the Ottoman Empire. During the second reign of her step-son Mehmed the Conqueror, she held the position of Valide Hatun, a title equivalent to the later Valide Sultan which means queen mother. Mara Hatun is portrayed by Tuba B√ºy√ºk√ºst√ºn in the Netflix original historical docudrama Rise of Empires: Ottoman (2020). Family Mara and her relations are named in \\"Dell'Imperadori Constantinopolitani\\", a manuscript held in the Vatican Library. The document is also known as the \\"Massarelli manuscript\\" because it was found in the papers of Angelo Massarelli (1510‚Äì1566). Masarelli is better known as the general secretary of the Council of Trent, who recorded the daily occurrings of the council.\\"The Archives: the past & the present\\", section \\"The Council of Trent\\" The Massarelli manuscript names her as one of two daughters of ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá and Eirene Kantakouzene. The other sister was Catherine (Kantakuzina Katarina Brankoviƒá or Katarina of Celje), who was married to Ulrich II, Count of Celje (1406-1456). \\"The Byzantine Lady: Ten Portraits 1250‚Äì1500\\" (1994) by D. M. Nicol questioned her maternity, suggesting ƒêuraƒë had a prior marriage to a daughter of John IV of Trebizond. However his theory presented no sources and failed to take into account that John IV was born between 1395 and 1417. He would be unlikely to be a grandparent by the 1410s. On 11 September 1429, ƒêuraƒë made a donation to Esphigmenou Monastery at Mount Athos. The charter for the document names his wife Irene and five children. The Masarelli manuscript also names the same five children of ƒêuraƒë and Eirene. Other genealogies mention a sixth child, Todor Brankoviƒá. He could be a child who died young and thus not listed with his siblings. The oldest sibling listed in the Massarelli document was Grgur Brankoviƒá. The 1429 document mentions him with the title of Despot. According to The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest (1994) by J. V. A. Fine, Grgur was appointed governor of territories of southern Serbia associated to the House of Brankoviƒá. He was reportedly appointed by Murad II of the Ottoman Empire in 1439. In April 1441, Grgur was accused of plotting against Murad and his governorship terminated. He was imprisoned in Amasya and blinded on 8 May 1441.J. V. A. Fine, \\"The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest\\" (1994), page 531 According to Monumenta Serbica Spectantia Historiam Serbiae, Bosniae, Ragusii (1858) by Franz Miklosich, Grgur and his brothers co-signed a charter by which ƒêuraƒë confirmed the privileges of the Republic of Ragusa. The charted was dated to 17 September 1445.Franz Miklosich, \\"Monumenta Serbica Spectantia Historiam Serbiae, Bosniae, Ragusii\\" (1858), CCCL, page 433 According to the \\"Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten\\" (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke, Grgur retired to a monastery under the monastic name \\"German\\".Detlev Schwennicke, \\"Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten\\" (1878), vol. 3, page 180 According to Fine, Grgur resurfaced in 1458, claiming the succession of the vacant throne of Serbia for himself or his son.J. V. A. Fine, \\"The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest\\" (1994), page 574 The Massarelli manuscript mentioned Grgur as unwed. Later genealogies name his wife as \\"Jelisaveta\\". Vuk Grgureviƒá, a son of Grgur, was later a titular Serbian despot (1471‚Äì1485). He was possibly an illegitimate. Mara is mentioned as the second child in the manuscript. Then are listed Stefan Brankoviƒá and \\"Cantacuzina\\", a sister with the Latinized version of their mother's last name. Later genealogies give her name as Katarina. She married Ulrich II of Celje. The last sibling mentioned was Lazar Brankoviƒá, the youngest of the five. Marriage According to Fine, Mara was betrothed to Murad II in June 1431. The betrothal was an attempt to prevent an invasion of Serbia from the Ottoman Empire, though periodic Ottoman raids continued. On 4 September 1435, the marriage took place at Edirne. Her dowry included the districts of Duboƒçica and Toplica.J. V. A. Fine, \\"The Late Medieval Balkans, A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest\\" (1994), page 530 A letter from Mehmed the Conqueror to his stepmother Mara Despina Hatun (1459) According to the chronicle of George Sphrantzes, Mara was going back to her parents when Murad II died, dating her return to 1451. Sphrantzes records that the widow rejected a marriage proposal by Constantine XI, Byzantine Emperor.George Sphrantzes, \\"Chronicle\\" , Book 3, page 213 Sphrantzes records that when her parents died (in 1456‚Äì1457), Mara joined the court of her stepson Mehmed II. According to Nicol, Mara maintained a presence at court but was also offered her own estate at \\"Je≈æevo\\". Nicol identifies Je≈æevo with the modern settlement of near Serres.D. M. Nicol, \\"The Byzantine Lady: Ten Portraits 1250‚Äì1500\\" (1994), pp. 115, 119 When Mehmed became sultan, she often provided him with advice.D. M.

Nicol, \\"The Byzantine Lady: Ten Portraits 1250‚Äì1500\\" (1994), p. 118 According to Nicol, Mara was joined at \\"Je≈æevo\\" by her sister \\"Cantacuzina\\" in 1469. The two ladies acted as intermediaries between Mehmed and the Republic of Venice during the second Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1463‚Äì1479). In 1471, Brankoviƒá personally accompanied a Venetian ambassador to the Porte for negotiations with the Sultan.D. M. Nicol, \\"The Byzantine Lady: Ten Portraits 1250‚Äì1500\\" (1994), p. 116 She retained her influence over the appointment of leaders of the Orthodox Church, and remained influential during the reign of Mehmed's successor, Bayezid II. The monks of Rila monastery begged her to have the remains of John of Rila transferred to Rila monastery from Veliko Tarnovo, and thanks to her their wish was fulfilled in 1469. Because of her influence, special privileges were offered to the Greek Orthodox Christians of Jerusalem, later extended to the community of Athos Monastery.D. M. Nicol, \\"The Byzantine Lady: Ten Portraits 1250‚Äì1500\\" (1994), p. 118, also ref. p. 142 After the unsuccessful Battle of Vaslui (Moldavia, 1475), Mara remarked that the battle was the worst defeat for the Ottoman Empire.Istoria lui ≈ûtefan cel Mare, p. 133. Mehmed the Conqueror bestowed upon her the title of Valide Hatun (queen mother) as she raised him as her own child and he was grateful for that. Mehmed called her Valide Mara which means mother Mara. Mara remained in Mehmed's court until his death in 1481. Ancestry Popular culture The character of Mara Hatun is fictionalized and portrayed by Tuba B√ºy√ºk√ºst√ºn in the Netflix original historical docudrama Rise of Empires: Ottoman (2020). She is shown as someone who was brought from Serbia, who married Murad II for political reasons, and who supported Mehmed the Conqueror and influenced him.

He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1940 and played first-class cricket as a right-handed opening batsman between 1926 and 1952 for Nottinghamshire. Keeton scored a century against every other first-class county and his 312 not out made in just under eight hours against Middlesex at the Oval in 1939 is still a record for the Nottinghamshire team. He also played professional association football for Nottingham Forest and Sunderland, for the latter as an inside forward. Family and background Keeton was born at Shirebrook, a mining community south-east of Chesterfield in Derbyshire. His parents were William and Mary Ann and both they and Keeton's older sister Doris were born at Eckington, another mining village to the north-east of Chesterfield; by the time of the 1911 census, the family was settled at Forest Town, a mining community in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where Keeton's father was employed as a stallman in a mine. Keeton remained in the Mansfield area all of his life and died at Forest Town. He married Florence E. Russell in the Mansfield registration district in 1929. Early cricket career Keeton made his debut for Nottinghamshire's second eleven in 1925 and the following year made his first- team debut, playing in two County Championship matches as a lower middle-order batsman. The Nottinghamshire side of the late 1920s was a settled and successful unit under the captaincy of Arthur Carr, with apparently ageless batsmen such as George Gunn, Wilfred Payton and the slightly younger William Whysall, Willis Walker and Carr himself dominating the batting line-up. Keeton and other young batsmen such as Charles Harris and George Gunn junior were given few first-team opportunities, and Keeton played in just five games in 1928 and two in the Championship-winning season of 1929 ‚Äì one of those two was against Oxford University ‚Äì and none at all in both 1927 and 1930. During the 1930 season, Nottinghamshire announced that it would no longer regularly select Gunn, who was 51 at the time, and Payton, who was 48, after the end of the season in order to open up places in the side for younger batsmen; when Whysall, a \\"stripling\\" of 43, died unexpectedly following a fall in November 1930, the county decided not to reverse the policy, and accordingly in the 1931 season new players came into the team, among them Keeton. (In practice, the policy was modified and Gunn played fairly regularly in 1931 and 1932, and Payton was also recalled for a few matches in 1931.) Promoted to open the innings (often alongside Gunn), Keeton responded with an unbeaten century in the game against Essex in June 1931 and thereafter was a regular in that position for the rest of the season. By the end of his first full season of first-class cricket he had amassed 1233 runs at an average of 30.07. That first full season was just the prelude to highly prolific run-getting by Keeton in the next three years, in which he passed 2,000 first-class runs in each season. In the 1932 season, he scored seven centuries. They included an unbeaten 200 against Cambridge University, the first double-century of his career, which proved to be 85 more runs than the Cambridge side made in their two innings combined. Later in the same year he improved on that highest score with an innings of 242 against Glamorgan, made in 330 minutes with three sixes and 27 fours. By the end of the season, Gunn having been injured and then retiring, Keeton had been joined by Harris as his regular opening partner, and the partnership continued up to the Second World War and, on occasion, after it. That Keeton may have been in the minds of the England Test team selectors was shown by the fact that he was picked for a North v South match, a Test trial England v The Rest game that was almost entirely washed out by rain, and the Folkestone edition of the Gentlemen v Players series in 1932, though he was not conspicuously successful in any of these games. By the end of the 1933 season, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Keeton had \\"firmly established himself as the best batsman in the team\\". The Wisden report went on: \\"To those who followed the team he recalled memories of the County's greatest batsmen. Though scarcely comparable in method to the giants of the past because of the changed type of most bowlers met in these days, Keeton developed the highest art in defence and run-getting. Possessed of all the strokes, he was especially strong in such attractive features in a batsman's make-up as cutting and off-driving... Keeton, if slow to mature, found himself at the age of 28 in his third full season with the County, mentioned with William Gunn, George Gunn and Arthur Shrewsbury.\\" He scored more than 1000 runs in August 1933 alone, with six centuries in the month, including four in five innings. But again his representative cricket was confined to a few end- of-season matches of doubtful seriousness. Test cricketer Keeton was again Nottinghamshire's leading batsman in 1934, averaging more than 43 runs an innings, and his three centuries in the season included two double-centuries. Against Gloucestershire in June he scored 261, his highest score to that point, from a weak attack in which all players except the wicketkeeper bowled. Less than a month later he made 223 against Worcestershire. When a few days later Herbert Sutcliffe was forced through injury to stand down from the England team to play the Australians in the fourth Ashes Test at Leeds, Keeton was drafted in as his replacement for his Test debut. It was not a good Test match for England: outplayed in all departments over four days, they saved the match through the intervention, when they were 165 runs behind with just four second-innings wickets remaining, of a thunderstorm which flooded the pitch, making further play impossible. No England batsman reached 50 in either innings, and Keeton, with scores of 25 and 12, like all his batting colleagues, got into double figures twice but not much further; by contrast, Bill Ponsford scored 181 and Don Bradman 304 for the Australians. Sutcliffe was recovered by the time of the fifth Test and resumed his place in the team at Keeton's expense. This setback was followed another in the early days of 1935: Keeton was knocked down and seriously injured by a lorry near his home in Mansfield in January, fracturing his ribs and suffering concussion. He was in hospital for three weeks and his doctors were reporting as saying that he was unlikely to be fit for cricket until the end of the 1935 season. In the event, he returned to the Nottinghamshire side in late June, played for less than two months and then stood down from playing again in mid-August; unsurprisingly, his aggregate and average fell significantly. Keeton returned to fitness in time for the 1936 season and if this was not one of his more outstanding seasons, in that his average was in the mid-30s and his highest score was only 115, he still scored more runs than anyone else for Nottinghamshire. He repeated that in 1937 when his average rose to 45 and his aggregate passed 2000 runs for the season again, though for Nottinghamshire he and the other batsmen were overshadowed by the brilliance of Joe Hardstaff junior who averaged 66 runs per innings in county games. Among highlights for Keeton in 1937 was a series of innings in which he scored three centuries, plus other scores of 99 not out and 97, in the course of eight matches. He was not, however, called in for any of the Test matches against the New Zealand side when the England selectors blooded several new players. The 1938 season was the least productive of Keeton's first-class career: he made 1512 runs at an average of 29.07, the only time his batting average dipped below 30 in a full season of cricket. Wisden noted that \\"after an indifferent start Keeton went through other spells of mediocrity\\", but added that he had been \\"perhaps not in the best of health judging by the necessity of an operation for appendicitis in October\\". But he returned to health and form in 1939 with an average for the first time over 50: 1765 runs at 51.91. The runs included the Nottinghamshire record score of 312 not out, which was made at The Oval against Middlesex because Lord's, the usual Middlesex home ground, was required by its owner, the MCC, for the Eton v Harrow match. The innings lasted seven hours and a quarter and included 28 fours and a five, and Keeton was missed four times in the course of it. Keeton's form across the season led to his recall for a second Test match: the final game of a three-match series with the West Indies. In a game of high scoring, he was not successful, being out without scoring in the first innings and making only 20 in the second; it was the last Test match played before the Second World War and was also the end of Keeton's limited Test career. But after his most successful season so far, Keeton was named in the 1940 edition of Wisden as one its Cricketers of the Year. Postwar cricket Keeton played several good-standard matches during the Second World War, including appearing for a team representing the National Police in 1943. He was available for Nottinghamshire from the resumption of English first-class cricket in 1946 and his form seemed merely to carry on from its pre-war excellence. In 1946, he was one of only seven English batsmen to pass 2000 runs in the season, with 2021 at an average of 43.93, including five centuries. The aggregate was lower in the run-glut sun- filled summer of 1947, but he maintained his average, and though both aggregate and average were down in 1948, he still scored more runs than any other Nottinghamshire batsman. Against the 1948 Australians, Keeton was hit over the heart by a ball from fast bowler Ray Lindwall and had to be helped from the pitch; a precautionary X-ray revealed that the ribs damaged in the 1935 lorry accident had not been broken again, though Keeton did not resume his innings and missed the next two county matches. In 1949, at the age of 44, Keeton enjoyed what was, in terms of his average, his best season of all: he made 2049 runs at an average of 55.37, with six centuries, including the last double-century of his career. This was an innings of 210 against Yorkshire made in 405 minutes and he shared a first-wicket partnership of 174 with Reg Simpson and a third-wicket stand of 260 with Hardstaff. Keeton \\"showed no sign of the advancing years\\", Wisden reported. But the very next season he missed early games through illness and later matches through a broken finger, and failed to complete 1000 runs in a season for only the second time since he became a full-time first-team player. There was a further decline in average in 1951, when he scored 922 runs at an average of 30.73, but there was also a final century, an innings of 142 when he shared an opening partnership of 269 with Simpson in the match against Kent. Nottinghamshire having finished at the bottom of the County Championship for the first time ever in 1951, the county decided in 1952 to play younger cricketers; Keeton appeared in only one further match, unsuccessfully, and retired after topping the averages for the second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship. Cricket style Both right-handed opening batsmen, Keeton and Harris shared more than 40 century partnerships and emerged from their years of opening the Nottinghamshire batting together with similar aggregate and average records. But they had very dissimilar styles and temperaments. Writing of Harris, the journalist and cricketer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: \\"Harris is a dreamer. He is a strange addition to Walter Keeton as they walk out to open an innings; Keeton strung up, concentrated, quick-glancing; Harris serenely distrait, revolving idealistic strokes against an attack that will not occur; lagging sometimes a pace or two behind, like a boy with parent on an unwilling Sunday walk.\\" Where Harris was seen as \\"enigmatic\\", likely to block a full toss or to fashion an on-drive off an unplayable delivery, Keeton was consistent and reliable, though his range of strokes was very wide. Almost all of Keeton's best batting was done within the confines of the County Championship for Nottinghamshire: all of his 54 centuries were for the county, and all but one (the 200 not out against Cambridge University) were in Championship matches. For Nottinghamshire, his batting average was a shade over 40; his comparative lack of success in his few other matches brought his career average back to 39.53. In addition to his batting, Keeton was also highly rated as an outfielder, often at third man; he was not a bowler at all, and took only two wickets in his entire career, both of them in the last throes of a tame draw at Horsham in 1934. After cricket In retirement, Keeton ran a sports shop and was in clerical work with the National Coal Board. He died in 1980 at the age of 75.

Jack Iddon was a right-handed middle-order batsman who hit the ball hard and a slow left-arm bowler who achieved a lot of turn on wearing pitches. He was an integral part of successful Lancashire teams from 1926 to 1939, passing 1,000 runs in a season 13 times - every year except 1927 - and going on to 2,381 runs in 1934. His best bowling season was 1932 when he took 80 wickets. In later years, he was inclined to be expensive and bowled less, but his best bowling performance of 9 for 42 in an innings in the Roses match against Yorkshire came in 1937, a season when he took only 28 wickets in all matches. Iddon's Test cricket was confined to the 1934-35 tour to the West Indies, when he played in all four Test matches, and one match against the South African cricket team in 1935. In the Caribbean, he came second in the England batting averages despite never batting higher than No 7 in any innings; with George Paine and Eric Hollies in the side, his opportunities for bowling were limited to just seven overs. In the first match of the 1935 series, he again batted at No 7, scored 29 and bowled four overs for three runs. But he was dropped and never regained a Test place. Iddon played for Lancashire in a couple of the non-first-class matches arranged after the end of the Second World War in Europe in 1945, but was not intending to resume full-time cricket in 1946, though the county hoped he would appear on occasion as an amateur and had appointed him team captain. He was working as a technical representative for a company making brake linings in Manchester, and he was on his way home from a business meeting at Rolls-Royce in Crewe when he was killed in a road accident just before the start of the 1946 season.Biography Retrieved 28 October 2011 References Category:1902 births Category:1946 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:Road incident deaths in England Category:People from Croston Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Lancashire cricket captains Category:Sir Julien Cahn's XI cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:H.

A tall lower-order right-handed batsman and an orthodox left-arm spinner, Paine played in five first-class matches for Middlesex in 1926, but then qualified by residence to play for Warwickshire, making his debut in 1929. Inclined in his first two seasons to be expensive, he developed in 1931 into a top-class spinner, adding extra flight and spin to his delivery. He took 127 wickets in that season and passed the 100 wickets mark in each of the next five seasons, with a best performance of 156 wickets in 1934, when he was top of the first-class averages. He was picked as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1935 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. In 1934-35, he was chosen, with his county colleague Eric Hollies, for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of the West Indies and there he played his only Test matches. He took more wickets, 17, than any other England bowler and also hit the highest score, 49, in England's innings of 226 in the third Test match, having been sent in as a nightwatchman. But the tour as a whole was not a success, with the West Indies winning the four-match series by two to one, and Paine was not picked for any further Test matches. In fact, in 1935, though he still took more than 100 wickets, Paine was much less effective for Warwickshire; Wisden for 1936 says that he \\"suffered from physical trouble\\", which appears to have been rheumatism, and that he had lost much of the flight and spin that had made him a force since 1931. He was ill for much of 1936, back but out of form in 1937 and after another ineffective season in 1938, he refused the terms Warwickshire offered for 1939 and left first-class cricket, though he reappeared in one match in 1947.

Five of the six main fossil fish groups from this period (dating from 370 million years ago) can be found here. A great quantity of some of the best-preserved fossil specimens of lobe-finned fish, ancestors to the tetrapods (believed to be the first four-legged air-breathing terrestrial vertebrates), were found here. History The fossil site was discovered in 1842, by Abraham Gesner (1797‚Äì1864), a geologist and medical doctor, and a pioneer in the petroleum industry. Gesner found a vast array of important fossils, which were handed over to the British Museum and the Royal Scottish Museum; these discoveries caused great excitement throughout the world. There was a rumour in the 1970s that some Americans were seeking to purchase the land containing the fossil deposits. In 1985 the Qu√©bec government blocked this possible privatization by purchasing a large tract of the land and declaring it a provincial (called \\"national\\" in Qu√©bec) park. The peripheral area is owned by about 100 people who limit development, protecting this important site. To date, over 5,000 fossils from this one site have been identified and categorized.

He is known mainly for his instrumental music. He mixed the style of the late Renaissance with the emerging Baroque, and also Italian idioms with Polish folk material; and in addition he was one of the first native-born Italian composers to visit Sweden. Life He was born near Treviso between 1560 and 1565, possibly at Serravale where his father is documented as being a teacher. Around 1565 his family, who were Protestants, fled Italy to escape the Inquisition, and settled in Poland. Cato, who had left Italy before the age of five, received all of his musical education in Krak√≥w, where the family settled. The first record of his employment dates from 1588, when he was hired as a lutenist by the court of King Sigismund III Vasa, a position he kept until 1593. In 1591 he wrote music for the wedding of Jan Kostka at ≈öwiecie castle; the Kostka family may have been patrons of his, since Stanis≈Çaw Kostka left him a considerable legacy in 1602. In 1593 and 1594 he went with King Sigismund to Sweden, where his fame as a lutenist and composer was evidently large; as late as 1600 he was still the most famous composer of Italian origin known in Sweden. Some of his music, including a few Polish dances, survives from sources only in Sweden. The last tentative record of his life is from 1619, when there is a single unconfirmed reference to him playing the lute during that year. Music Cato wrote both vocal and instrumental music, and both sacred and secular: however he was most famous for his works for lute. The lute works include dozens of pieces in many forms and styles, including choreae polonicae, fantasias, galliards, transcriptions of Italian madrigals, passamezzos, and preludes, all of which he probably played himself. Stylistically, they cover the full range of possibilities on the lute. The preludes are chordal for the most part; the fantasias are imitative ricercars; and there is a set of eight Polish dances, probably derived from actual folk music. Some aspects of early Baroque style are clear in Cato's music, including the use of short motifs which recur to unify longer sections, and the use of linking episodic sections between thematic statements; on the other hand, some of his lute music includes lines of vocal character in strict imitation, more in the style of the mid-to-late 16th century polyphonists. Other instrumental music by Cato includes pieces for consorts of viols, as well as solo keyboard. His vocal works include settings of Polish sacred songs in a collection entitled Rytmy ≈Çaci≈Ñskie dziwnie sztuczne ... for four voices and lute, as well as Pie≈õ≈Ñ o ≈õwiƒôtym Stanis≈Çawie, for four voices unaccompanied. He also wrote an Italian madrigal, Tirsi morir volea, for five voices, though it only exists in an arrangement for solo voice and instrumental accompaniment: a transcription which could represent a conscious conformance to the new Baroque conception of the solo madrigal.

The bridge, which connects Woodbridge on the north with Sayreville on the south, was opened to weekend traffic starting on October 11, 1940, and was opened permanently on November 15, 1940. As of 2003, the bridge carries more than 82,000 vehicles daily and is owned and operated by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. It also runs directly parallel to the Driscoll Bridge. Construction The design of the Edison Bridge was the direct responsibility of Morris Goodkind, chief engineer of the bridge division of the New Jersey State Highway Department, a position he had held since 1925. The bridge is named for Thomas Edison. Construction on the bridge was started on September 26, 1938. The Edison Bridge was officially dedicated on December 14, 1940, with the ribbon cut by Mrs. Mina Edison Hughes, widow of the inventor. Also participating in the ceremonies were New Jersey Governor A. Harry Moore, and then Governor-elect Charles Edison, son of the inventor, along with the bridge's designer, Morris Goodkind. The final design called for a bridge with 29 spans and an overall length of . The nine spans over the river would consist of three continuous span girders of record-setting proportions. The main girder over the navigation channel would be in length, consisting of a span flanked by two spans, and would set a new U.S. record for length. The two other continuous girders were each in length, consisting of three spans. The final cost of the bridge was $4,696,000. More than of masonry, 50 percent buried from sight, went into the foundations, piers, and deck of the bridge. Over 2,500,000 pounds (1,133.98 metric tons) of reinforcing steel and 19,000,000 pounds (8,618.26 metric tons) of structural steel were used. Rehabilitation As part of a $48 million construction project, a major overhaul of the aging sixty-year-old bridge was undertaken, to address issues relating to the advanced age of the structure and to bring it up to the latest highway standards. The rehabilitated northbound span of the bridge was opened on to traffic on October 21, 2003, and marked the long- awaited conversion of the old Edison Bridge from a one-span, 4-lane structure with no shoulders to a two-span bridge with a total of six lanes with shoulders. On November 19, 2001, the southbound span was officially renamed \\"The Ellis S. Vieser Memorial Bridge\\" in a bill sponsored by Senator Joseph Kyrillos.

Career Known as \\"Big Jim\\", Smith joined the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) ground staff in 1926 and played for Wiltshire until 1933. He qualified for Middlesex in 1934 and took 172 wickets at 18.88 to finish 6th in the bowling averages in his debut season. He was selected for the 1934‚Äì35 MCC tour of the West Indies on the strength of this performance and played in every Test there. On debut, he took five wickets in the second innings in Bridgetown. He also appeared for England against New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1937. Smith only batted 10 times in Tests, but until his last innings he never batted in the same position in two successive innings. During his brief career he batted at numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 (twice) and 10 (twice). In 1935, Smith was elected one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his achievements in the 1934 season. A six-foot four inch fast bowler, Smith's accuracy and appetite for hard work earned him 676 career wickets at 17.75 before the onset of World War II effectively ended his career. Although primarily a fast bowler, Smith earned a reputation as a big-hitting tail- ender. In 1938, he scored a half-century in just 11 minutes against Gloucestershire at Bristol, the fastest genuine fifty on record. Previously, in 1935, he had scored 50 in 14 minutes against Kent while his sole first- class century, an unbeaten 101, was scored in 81 minutes, also against Kent. Another achievement was being credited by some with the biggest six in history, at Lord's in 1937, when he played a shot that cleared the Old Grandstand on the north side of the ground. His older brother, William, also played first-class cricket.

It sits east of St. Augustine, running north‚Äìsouth in a slightly southeastern direction to Matanzas Inlet. The island is about long and an average of 1 mile in width. It is separated from the mainland by the Matanzas River, part of the Intracoastal waterway. Matanzas Bay, the body of water between the island and downtown St. Augustine, opens into St. Augustine Inlet. Part of the island (the Davis Shores and Lighthouse Park neighborhoods) is within St. Augustine city limits, while other communities on the island include St. Augustine Beach, Coquina Gables, Butler Beach, Crescent Beach, and Treasure Beach. Fort Matanzas National Monument, a Spanish colonial-era fort built in 1740‚Äì1742, is located at the southern end of the island on Rattlesnake Island in the Intracoastal waterway within the park boundaries; it was designed to protect St. Augustine from attack via the Matanzas River.  History  Juan Ponce de Le√≥n may have landed on the barrier island in 1513. Spanish Admiral Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, founder of St. Augustine, moved his initial settlement to Anastasia Island after a revolt by the Timucuan Indians in 1566. This settlement was short-lived, and the colonists moved back to the mainland at the site of present-day downtown St. Augustine. Original Anastasia Island lighthouse, now destroyed. Lower parts of the coquina tower dated to the First Spanish Period. The Spanish built a wooden watch-tower on the northern end of Anastasia Island to warn the town of approaching vessels by raising signal flags.Reynolds 1890, p. 78 It was sighted by Sir Francis Drake in 1586; consequently he came ashore and attacked the city. The Spanish eventually replaced the tower with a coquina structure that was converted into a lighthouse soon after Florida came into the possession of the United StatesReynolds 1890, p. 79 in 1821. This was replaced by the present-day St. Augustine Light in 1874. The original lighthouse collapsed in 1880 due to beach erosion and the encroachment of the sea. The earliest built residence on Anastasia Island still standing is the lighthouse keepers' house built in 1876 next to the present lighthouse. Several other houses in the Lighthouse Park neighborhood date to the 1880s. The island was part of a 10,000 acre land grant from the Spanish crown to the land dealer Jesse Fish, who established a plantation, El Vergel (The Orchard), and built his home there in 1763. Fish planted orange groves on the property which produced fruit known as far away as London for its juiciness and sweetness. His production increased annually until 1776, when he shipped a total of 65,000 oranges from Florida. In 1792, Jesse Fish's son, Jesse Fish, Jr., purchased the tract, amounting to the whole of \\"St. Anastasia\\" island except certain lands marked off by officials as reserved, such as the King's Quarry. Sarah Fish, Jesse Fish, Jr.'s wife and heir, filed a claim that was reported to Congress in 1826 as valid by the commissioners for East Florida and the Secretary of State of the United States, and subsequently confirmed by an act of Congress on May 23, 1828. The land developer David Paul Davis, known as \\"D. P.\\" or \\"Doc\\", a native of Green Cove Springs, developed the Davis Shores neighborhood at the north end of Anastasia Island during the land boom of the mid‚Äì1920s. In 1925‚Äì1926 he filled in the extensive salt marshes located directly opposite the center of St. Augustine across the Matanzas River. As the construction bubble collapsed and real estate values plummeted, D.P. Davis mysteriously disappeared at sea on October 12, 1926. Construction of the Bridge of Lions had begun in 1925 to provide access to his projected development and was completed in 1927. A rehabilitation and partial replacement of the Bridge of Lions, as well as restoration of its two Medici lions statues began in 2006 and was completed in 2010. During World War II the Coast Guard occupied the lighthouse, and other residences in Davis Shores were used as barracks for soldiers. Beneath the sandy soil of most of the island lie layers of coquina, a shelly rock in various stages of consolidation. This rock is composed primarily of whole and fragmented shells of the donax, or coquina, clam admixed occasionally with scattered fossils of various marine vertebrates, including sharks' and rays' teeth. This deposition is known as the Anastasia Formation, and was formed during the Late Pleistocene epoch, in the period of successive glacial ages from about 110,000 years to 11,700 years ago. It is the only local natural source of stone, and was quarried by the Spanish and later the British to construct many of the buildings in St. Augustine (including the Castillo de San Marcos). An old well and chimney made of coquina rock, located on Old Beach Road, are all that remain of the Spanish barracks built to house the workers who mined the coquina for construction of the fort. These included quarry overseers, masons, and stonecutters. The years-long project (1672-1695) was accomplished with the help of Native American forced labor and African slaves.

Other common names include the New Guinea treefrog, giant tree frog, and Australian giant treefrog. Description The white-lipped tree frog reaches in length.James Cook University, Australia: Litoria infrafrenata. Retrieved 19 June 2014 Females are larger than males, and have thicker skin in correlation with the difference in body size. Its dorsal surface is usually bright green, although the colour changes depending on the temperature and background, and can be brown. The ventral surface is off-white. The lower lip has a distinctive white stripe (giving this species its name), which continues to the shoulder. The white stripes on the trailing edges of the lower leg may turn pink in the breeding male. The white-lipped tree frog has large toe pads, which aid it to climb. The toes are completely webbed, and the hands are partially webbed. Ecology and behaviour The white-lipped tree frog is distributed in Australia along the coastal areas of Cape York Peninsula and the wet tropics of north-eastern Queensland. It is the most widely distributed tree frog in the New Guinea region, spanning from eastern Indonesia, through the New Guinea mainland, to the Bismarck and the Admiralty Islands in the north. It lives in rainforests, cultivated areas, and around houses in coastal areas, and is restricted to areas below 1200 m in altitude. It has a loud, barking call, but when distressed, it makes a cat-like \\"mew\\" sound or may discharge urine. Males call during spring and summer after rain from vegetation around the breeding site, normally a still body of water. Its diet is mainly insects and other arthropods. It can live to over 10 years in the wild. This species of frog is known for being moved around in fruit produce from northern Australia and ending up becoming a lost frog in southern areas. As a pet It is kept as a pet; but in Australia, it may be kept in captivity only with an appropriate permit.

Between 1931 and 1949 Mitchell-Innes played 132 first-class matches, appearing 69 times for Somerset, and 43 times for Oxford University. In these matches he scored 6,944 runs, including 13 centuries and a top score of 207. He was well-regarded for the grace of his batting, but his cricket career was limited by both hay fever and his overseas work commitments. Mitchell-Innes made his debut for Somerset while he was still a schoolboy at Sedbergh School in 1931. He subsequently went to Oxford University and appeared in the annual match against Cambridge in each of his four years. His total of 3,319 first-class runs is a record for the Oxford University team, and he is regarded as one of the best university cricketers ever. After completing each year at Oxford, he returned to play for Somerset. He played his best years of cricket while at university, passing 1,000 runs in the season during three of his four years there. After graduating from university, he joined the Sudan Political Service and missed the 1938 cricket season entirely. He was only available for Somerset during periods of leave thereafter, often playing for around four to six weeks. In 1948, he was one of three players to captain Somerset when the county struggled to appoint anyone on a permanent basis. He played his last first-class matches in 1949. Mitchell-Innes left the Sudan Political Service in 1954, and became the company secretary at Vaux Breweries. Upon the death of Alf Gover in October 2001, he became England's oldest surviving Test cricketer until his own death in December 2006, when the distinction passed to Ken Cranston. Early life Norman Stewart Mitchell-Innes was born in Calcutta on 7 September 1914, where his father was a businessman of Scottish descent. Both his father, also named Norman, and his grandfather, Gilbert, were keen golfers. The former was the All India Amateur Golf Champion in 1893 and 1894, while the latter captained Prestwick Golf Club. He moved to England with his family at the age of five to live in Minehead, Somerset, and gained a scholarship to Sedbergh School based in Cumbria. At Sedbergh he developed quickly as a cricketer, first playing for the school's first team aged 15. The subsequent year, he scored 302 not out in a house match in one afternoon. In the summer of 1931, after scoring two half- centuries for Sedbergh against Durham School and Stonyhurst College, Mitchell- Innes was called up to play for Somerset County Cricket Club in a County Championship match against Warwickshire. He had to travel down from Scotland by overnight train for the fixture at the County Ground, Taunton. He took two wickets, and scored 23 runs in the match, which was drawn. In both 1932 and 1933, Mitchell-Innes captained the Sedbergh School cricket team, and was invited to play at Lord's Cricket Ground for representative school sides, and he also made eight further County Championship appearances for Somerset. He failed to make a mark for the county in 1932, recording a batting average of 6.50, but in 1933 he achieved his first half-century in first-class cricket, scoring 57 against Warwickshire, before hitting his own wicket. In a review of their cricket side in July 1933, The Sedberghian says of Mitchell-Innes that \\"such cricketers seldom come this way\\", praising his consistency, fielding and captaincy, though it does note that his off drive often failed to score him boundaries, and that his bowling lacked accuracy at times. Mitchell-Innes also played fives and rugby for the school, and was president of the debating society. On completion of his studies at Sedbergh, he won an exhibition to study Law at Brasenose College, Oxford. Mitchell-Innes was selected for the university cricket team during his first year at Oxford and made his debut against Gloucestershire. He scored his maiden first-class century in the first innings of the match which Oxford nearly won. He achieved two further centuries for Oxford that year, hitting 140 runs against the Minor Counties in a high-scoring draw, and then 171 against Surrey at The Oval. In all matches for the university that season he scored 998 runs at an average of 55.44, leading Oxford batsman that year, though Fredrick de Saram scored more runs. Mitchell-Innes won his Blue‚Äîthe awarding of the Oxford \\"colours\\" to sportsmen‚Äîby appearing in the 1934 University match against Cambridge, a match in which he batted with moderate success, scoring 27 and 42 in a drawn match.Bolton (1962), pp. 281‚Äì285. In comparison to his performances for Oxford, Mitchell-Innes struggled during his eleven first-class matches for Somerset that summer: he averaged 20.93, and only passed fifty runs once, against Sussex. In the same match, he recorded the best bowling figures of his first-class career, taking four wickets for 65 runs. Mitchell-Innes' performances during the season earned him selection for the Gentlemen against Players fixture at Folkestone. England Test recognition The Oxford cricket historian Geoffrey Bolton describes the next two years as being \\"full of disappointment\\" for Oxford.Bolton (1962), pp. 285‚Äì288. Partially indicative of this, Mitchell-Innes once again topped the batting averages, and led all Oxford batsmen in terms of runs scored, but his figures were in stark contrast to the previous year: he averaged 38.70 for his 774 runs. He hit centuries against Lancashire and Surrey, and against the touring South Africans. His score of 168 against South Africa helped gain Oxford a first innings lead, though the match finished a draw. Amongst the crowd for the match was Pelham Warner, one of the selectors for the England cricket team, who enjoyed the innings so much that he invited Mitchell-Innes to play against South Africa in the first Test match at Trent Bridge. In a three-day match curtailed by rain, Mitchell-Innes batted once, scoring five runs before being trapped leg before wicket by Bruce Mitchell. He was retained for the second Test, but was suffering badly from hay fever, and wrote to Warner to advise him that, \\"I might be sneezing just as a catch came in the slips.\\" Warner agreed, and called up Errol Holmes to replace him ‚Äì Mitchell-Innes never got another chance to play for England. Hay fever also curtailed Mitchell-Innes' performance during the University match: despite being described as \\"the best batsman on either side\\" by Bolton, he was dismissed for scores of one and nought as Cambridge won by 195 runs. Brasenose College, Oxford, which Mitchell-Innes attended in the 1930s.Shortly after the University match, Mitchell-Innes was once again invited to play for the Gentlemen against the Players, on this occasion in the more prestigious Lord's fixture. Returning to Somerset for his summer break, Mitchell-Innes struck his first century in county cricket, hitting 139 runs as Somerset followed on against Lancashire. He appeared in seven of Somerset's twenty-six fixtures, and although he was well short of his teammates' total runs for the season, he led Somerset's batting averages in 1935, accruing his 420 runs at an average of 38.18. At the end of the summer, he was chosen to play for an \\"England XI\\" against South Africa during the Folkestone cricket festival, though in a resounding victory for the tourists, he failed to make much impact. After the English cricket team's tour of Australia in 1932‚Äì33, known for the Bodyline bowling tactics used by the English team, relations between the Australian Board of Control and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were strained. In the English winter of 1935‚Äì36, the MCC sent a team to tour Australia and New Zealand, in an attempt to regain some good will in Australia. Holmes captained the side, which was predominantly composed of younger players the MCC wanted to gain experience. Mitchell-Innes was included in the touring party, and played in ten first- class matches, including two of the four contests against the New Zealand national cricket team. He scored four first-class half-centuries, achieving his highest score of the tour against Otago, when he contributed 87 runs to the MCC's total of 550. Later University years In 1936 Mitchell-Innes was elected captain of the Oxford team. The side lacked the batting strength of the previous years, and he was forced to move himself from his preferred position of batting at number three or four, to open the batting during the season. The batting suffered a further blow just prior to the University match when Roger Kimpton suffered an injury and was unable to play. Along with Kimpton, Mitchell-Innes led the batting averages by a large margin, having scored 917 runs at 43.66. He also reached his highest score in first-class cricket against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, scoring 207 runs. Oxford lost more matches than they won during the season, including an eight-wicket loss to Cambridge in the University match. Despite the loss, the match was Mitchell-Innes' most successful contest against Cambridge, as he scored 43 and 84. During this season, Mitchell-Innes had his most effective spell as a bowler, taking 22 wickets for Oxford at an average of 26.27, but Bolton described the team's bowling performances as unremarkable.Bolton (1962), pp. 289‚Äì292. Before returning to play for Somerset, Mitchell-Innes once again featured for the Gentlemen at Lord's, though in a low-scoring match, he was dismissed for less than 20 runs in each innings. In six matches for Somerset in July and August, Mitchell-Innes scored 499 runs, and his average of 55.44 was the county's best that season. He scored 182, his best score for Somerset, in a County Championship match against Worcestershire, and followed it up with another century in the next match, against Lancashire. In all, 1936 was statistically Mitchell-Innes' best season; he scored 1,438 runs at an average of 44.93. In 1937, Mitchell-Innes was replaced as captain of Oxford by Sandy Singleton, and missed the start of the cricket season as he was busy studying. He did not play his first match until the middle of June, when he scored 137 and 66 not out against Leicestershire; his first innings total being described as \\"by far the best seen at Oxford this year.\\" Later in the month, he scored another century to help Oxford chase 347 runs in the fourth innings of the match to beat Sussex. In the lead up to the University match, Mitchell-Innes was \\"regarded as the outstanding batsman of the two sides\\" by The Times, but he did not bat well in the first innings, and was out for 19 runs. In the second innings, he fared a little better, scoring 29 runs to help Oxford to a seven wicket victory; their only win in the University match during Mitchell- Innes' time at Oxford. He topped the batting averages for Oxford once again, scoring his 630 runs at an average of 57.27.Bolton (1962), pp. 292‚Äì295. In all, during his four years at Oxford, he scored 3,319 first-class runs, a record for the university, at an average of 47.41. Shortly after the University match, Mitchell-Innes made his fourth appearance in as many years for the Gentlemen against the Players, but after being asked to the open the innings was out for just four runs in the first innings. He improved in the second innings, scoring fifty runs after an indifferent start, but was unable to prevent his side losing by eight wickets. He subsequently top-scored for Scotland in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders. In seven appearances for Somerset during the seasons, Mitchell-Innes was unable to replicate the form he had shown with Oxford, and only passed fifty run in an innings once, scoring 135 runs at an average of under ten. Occasional county cricketer While at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes had become good friends with Jake Seamer, who had also attended Brasenose College, and the pair were teammates for both Oxford and Somerset. Seamer had joined the Sudan Political Service (SPS) on his graduation in 1936,Foot (1986), p. 128. and while at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes also secured a role with the organisation that he would take up after his graduation. His duties with the SPS prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1938, but he made seven early-season appearances the following year, though two were for the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Free Foresters. It was for the latter of these that Mitchell-Innes made his only century of the season; playing against Oxford University, the Free Foresters required nearly 400 runs in the fourth innings to win. Mitchell-Innes opened the innings, and after the lunch interval on the final day he played attacking cricket, bringing up his century in 95 minutes. He was eventually dismissed for 143 runs, bowled as he tried to heave an on drive. The Free Foresters came within nine runs of their target, but were bowled out before they could reach it. In total, he scored 347 runs at 31.54 that year; the last season of first- class county cricket in England before it was interrupted by the Second World War. In 1946, Mitchell-Innes was only able to play for the first month of the season, appearing in six first-class matches. He only passed fifty once in those matches, when he scored 55 runs against Middlesex. The cricket correspondent for The Times said that \\"he has lost none of the skill which stamped him before the war as one of the best batsmen\\". The following season, Mitchell-Innes appeared seven times, all in the County Championship. He averaged 37, his highest total after leaving university, and scored four half- centuries. Mitchell-Innes was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped down at the end of the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for lumbago.Roebuck (1991), p. 232. There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome. So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained first by Mitchell-Innes during his leave from the Sudan, then Seamer during his own leave. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over.Roebuck (1991), p. 242. In his history of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck describes the situation as a \\"remarkable state of affairs\\", while David Foot suggests that the true number of captains was closer to seven.Foot (1986), p. 155. Mitchell-Innes appeared in Somerset's opening five fixtures; including a pre-season friendly match against Glamorgan. During a season which the Somerset County Herald speculated would be \\"unpredictable\\" and lacking the \\"exaggerated optimism\\" of 1947, the county club lost all five matches in which Mitchell-Innes was captain. Mitchell-Innes scored 222 runs, including a solitary half-century, during a 10-wicket loss to Middlesex. After Denis Compton and Bill Edrich had scored 252 and 168 respectively, Mitchell-Innes was one of few Somerset players to bat with any confidence in the first-innings, scoring 65 runs. When Mitchell-Innes left the team for the Sudan, they were bottom of the County Championship with no points; they finished the season 12th of 17 after collecting 92 points, including five wins. Batting was identified as Somerset's weakest area in both 1947 and 1948; Mitchell-Innes' batting average of 22.20 placed him sixth in the county averages in 1948. The following year, Woodhouse took over as Somerset captain full-time. Mitchell-Innes was once again available for the first few weeks of the season, playing seven matches. He finished near the bottom of Somerset's batting averages, having scored 157 runs at 11.21; the second-lowest average of his career. It was his last season of first-class cricket, and he played his final match in May 1949 against Hampshire. Later life He left the Sudan Political Service in 1954, and was company secretary of Vaux Breweries in Sunderland for 25 years. He married Patricia Rossiter in 1944, and they had a son and daughter together. He retired to Herefordshire in 1980, and lived with his daughter in Monmouthshire after his wife died in 1989. Upon the death of Alf Gover in October 2001, Mitchell-Innes became the oldest living England Test cricketer. Mitchell-Innes died on 28 December 2006, and was survived by a son and daughter. Upon his death, Ken Cranston became England's oldest living Test cricketer.

As the name implies, an animal's lead rope, attached to its halter, may be tied to a post or hitching rail with this knot. The benefit of the halter hitch is that it can be easily released by pulling on one end of the rope, even if it is under tension. Some sources show the knot being finished with the free end running through the slipped loop to prevent it from working loose or being untied by a clever animal, still allowing easy but not instant untying.  Tying  File:Pferdeanbindeknoten1.JPGHalter hitch 1 : Place rope behind, through or around anchor object. Form a loop in the working part of the rope. File:Pferdeanbindeknoten2.jpgHalter hitch 2 : Pull a bight of the working part behind the standing part and then through the loop formed in first step.  Difference from similar hitches with the same purpose  The halter hitch is topologically the same knot as the Falconer's knot, i. e. a slipped overhand knot around the main part. The falconer has to tie the same knot one handed, throwing the end around the anchor object (the perch), gripping it with a scissoring fingers act, pulling the bight from opposite side of the main part using the back of the thumb.

Stronger, traditionally used to tie a horse or reindeer by evenks in Siberia, tied with a method suitable for tying while wearing a glove. *The Slippery hitch and Buntline hitch are essentially a slipped Clove hitch around the main part. Slippery hitch has the slip placed under the last turn away from the main part, while Buntline hitch has the slip placed under the last turn towards the main part. Easy to tie, secure, easy to untie, Slippery hitch is used several in a row on square-rigged ships for securing the gaskets that bind stowed sails to the yards on top, while Buntline hitch, stronger but more difficult to untie, is used slipped to secure the bottom of open sail. *The half hitch with slip is one with no extra bight, no extra turn, just a slip inside the half hitch, much weaker than all of the above hitches.

Doll played college football for the USC Trojans (1944, 1946‚Äì1948) and professional football in the National Football League with the Detroit Lions (1949‚Äì1953), Washington Redskins (1954) and Los Angeles Rams (1955). He was selected to play in each of the first four Pro Bowls and was named the Most Valuable Player in the 1952 season Pro Bowl. He played safety on the 1952 Detroit Lions team that won the NFL championship. He tied an NFL record in 1949 with four interceptions in a single game and is the only player in NFL history to have 10 or more interceptions in each of three different seasons (1949, 1950 and 1953). When he retired at the end of the 1954 season, he was the NFL's all-time leader with 41 interceptions. After retiring as a player, Doll worked as a football coach for 34 years, serving as the head coach at West Contra Costa Junior College in 1956 and as an assistant coach with the University of Washington (1955), USC (1957‚Äì1958), Notre Dame (1959‚Äì1962), Detroit Lions (1963‚Äì1964), Los Angeles Rams (1965), Washington Redskins (1966‚Äì1970), Green Bay Packers (1971‚Äì1973), Baltimore Colts (1974), Miami Dolphins (1975‚Äì1976), San Francisco 49ers (1977) and Detroit Lions (1978‚Äì1988). During his NFL career, he was associated with the game's legendary coaches, as a player for Curly Lambeau and an assistant coach under Vince Lombardi and Don Shula. Early years Doll attended Grant Union High School in Sacramento, California, where he was an all-league quarterback. Doll was also named Cal-Hi Sports State Player of the Year for football in 1943. He is one of only four Sacramento-area players to earn the honor. USC and military service Doll played halfback (both offensive and defensive) for the USC Trojans from 1944 to 1948, though he did not play in 1945 while serving in the military. He led USC in rushing three times‚Äîin 1944, 1947 and 1948. He also led the team in receptions and scoring in 1948. =1944 season= In July 1944, he joined the Trojans as a 17-year- old freshman halfback. He played the 1944 season under his birth name, Don Burnside. In the 1944 season opener against UCLA, Doll had an immediate impact. He played halfback on both offense and defense (the norm in 1944), intercepting a Bob Waterfield pass and returning it 16 yards to the UCLA 22-yard line. On the next play, the Trojans again gave the ball to Doll who ran 20 yards to the 2-yard line. Two plays later, Doll scored on a 1-yard run to give USC a 13-0 lead at halftime. After the season opener, USC coach Jeff Cravath announced that Doll was being switched to the quarterback position for the second game of the season. Despite the experiment, Doll played principally at halfback during the 1944 season. Prior to the final regular season game (a re-match against UCLA), Al Wolf of the Los Angeles Times called him \\"S.C.'s 18-year-old freshman whiz.\\" The 1944 Trojans finished the season undefeated with an 8-0-2 record and defeated Tennessee 25-0 in the 1945 Rose Bowl. Doll played 43 minutes in the Rose Bowl and was the game's leading rusher. Los Angeles Times sports writer Braven Dyer wrote that Doll \\"shouldered the ball carrying burden almost single handedly\\" in the Rose Bowl. =U.S. Marine Corps= After playing in the Rose Bowl game, Doll was inducted into the United States Marine Corps. He served aboard the battleship and was an eyewitness to the Japanese surrender ceremony on the ship's deck on September 2, 1945. =1946 season and name change= Doll was honorably discharged from the military in June 1946 and returned to USC in time for summer practice. In July 1946, Braven Dyer wrote that USC had found \\"a new backfield star.\\" Dyer continued, \\"Fresh out of the Marines, the lad's name is Doll, Don Doll, that is.\\" Doll had changed his surname from \\"Burnside\\" to \\"Doll\\" after being discharged from the military. Doll later explained the reasoning behind his decision: > My stepfather, Adna Doll, raised me and as soon as I was old enough (and, > incidentally, had dough for the legal transfer) I changed my name to his > because I was grateful for all Dad had done for me. I thought that if any > honors came my way in football, I'd like to be known by his name. However, Doll recalled that \\"sports writers had a field day\\" with his new name: \\"When I weaved downfield I was the 'Dancing Doll.' If I took too long on a play, I was the 'Mechanical Doll.'\\" Doll played at the left halfback position for the 1946 Trojans. In the final game of the season, a 20-14 victory over Tulane in New Orleans, Doll had a key interception and return for 34 yards. =1947 season= In 1947, Doll added punting and punt and kickoff return duties to his role as a starting halfback. In October 1947, he was leading the Pacific Coast Conference with an average of 45 yards per punt; he was also leading the Conference with an average of 20 yards on punt returns. One of the highlights of the 1947 season for USC was a 32-0 victory in Columbus, Ohio, over a highly touted Ohio State team. Doll started the Trojans' scoring against the Buckeyes with a 42-yard touchdown run around the left end in the first quarter. Doll's longest gain of the season was a 95-yard kickoff return in a 21-0 victory over Cal. At the end of the 1947 season, Doll was picked as a first-team back on the United Press All-Coast Conference team. The 1947 Trojans won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and faced Michigan's famed \\"Mad Magicians\\" team in the 1948 Rose Bowl. USC lost the game 49-0, and Doll was one of the few USC players praised for his performance in the game. Sports writer Maxwell Stiles wrote, \\"Don Doll was a power in the secondary until he was forced out with what was reported to be a broken arm.\\" =1948 season= In 1948, Doll played his final season at the left halfback position for USC. He scored the Trojans' only touchdown on a 28-yard run in a 7‚Äì0 victory over Rice. The following week, Doll again scored USC's only touchdown, this time in an 8‚Äì7 loss to Oregon. He added two touchdowns in a 32‚Äì7 win over Washington. At the end of the 1948 season, Doll was selected as a first-team halfback on the Associated Press All-Pacific Coast Team. He was also selected as the halfback and punter for the West team in the 1948 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. Professional football player Doll on a 1951 Bowman football card Doll was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the 9th round (67th overall pick) of the 1948 NFL Draft and signed a one-year contract with the team in February 1949. He played as a defensive back for the Lions for four years from 1949 to 1952. He was selected as an All-Pro player in his first three seasons in the NFL (1949‚Äì1951). He was also selected four times to play in the Pro Bowl (1950‚Äì1953). At 5 feet, 11 inches, and 185 pounds, Doll was small for a professional football player. In a 1954 profile on Doll, a reporter noted, \\"Don, who's built like a bank clerk, piano tuner, soda jerk, errand boy or -- egad -- even a sports writer doesn't look any more like a pro gridder than your cousin Joe.\\" Doll explained how he handled the disparity in size with the players he was required to tackle: > I just throw a shoulder into 'em and hit 'em low. If they are over two tons > I aim for their shoelaces. If they're medium sized (around boxcar weight) I > hit for the thighs. I'll admit I do not drive 'em back but I stop 'em where > they are. ... My size is no detriment in football. I rate as the No. 1 asset > the 'desire' to tackle. And I've plenty of that desire. =1949 season= During his rookie season, Doll had 11 interceptions which he returned for 301 yards, including a 95-yard return for a touchdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers on October 8, 1949. His 301 return yards off interceptions set an NFL record that stood until 1961. His total still ranks 5th all-time in NFL history. Doll still holds the record for most interception return yards by a rookie, and it is one of the oldest remaining records in the NFL. Doll also led the NFL in 1949 with 536 kickoff return yards. He also tied an NFL record on October 23, 1949 with four interceptions in a 24-7 win over the Chicago Cardinals. =1950 season= In his second season in the NFL, Doll snagged 12 interceptions in 11 games, one interception short of the NFL record of 13 interceptions set by Dan Sandifer in 1948. At the end of the 1950 season, Doll was selected as a first-team All-Pro for the second straight year and was also selected to appear in his first Pro Bowl. =1951 and 1952 seasons= During the 1951 and 1952 seasons, Doll was selected to appear in his second and third Pro Bowls and received the George S. Halas Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the 1952 season Pro Bowl. Doll played safety on the 1952 Detroit Lions team that won the NFL championship. Though the 1952 Lions team is remembered mostly for the offensive output of Bobby Layne, the defense included Doll and Les Bingaman and led the NFL in both scoring defense and rush defense. In 2008, Doll was selected as a member of the Lions' 75th Season All-Time Team, recognizing him as \\"one of franchise's greatest players.\\" He still holds Lions' team records for interceptions in a season (12) and interception return yards in a season (301). =1953 season= At the start of the 1953 NFL season, Doll was traded by the Lions to the Washington Redskins, where he played under head coach Curly Lambeau. Doll totaled 10 interceptions for the 1953 season, making him the first player in NFL history to tally at least 10 interceptions in each of three seasons (11 in 1949, 12 in 1950 and 10 in 1953). Doll remains the only player in NFL history to accomplish this feat in three seasons. He was also selected for his fourth consecutive Pro Bowl. The Pro Bowl began with the 1950 NFL season, and Doll is one of the few players to have played in each of the first four Pro Bowls. =1954 season= In January 1954, Doll was traded to the Los Angeles Rams in a three-team, multi-player deal that also sent Night Train Lane to the Chicago Cardinals. At the time of the trade, Doll, who lived at the time in San Gabriel, California, told the Los Angeles Times, \\"This is good news. I've wanted to play for the Rams since I got out of school.\\" Doll concluded his playing career with the Rams and had five interceptions in 1954. When he retired at the end of the 1954 season, Doll was the NFL's all-time career leader with 41 interceptions. Coaching career Doll retired from playing football in 1955 and worked for the next 34 years as a football coach. In 1955, Doll was hired as an assistant coach at the University of Washington under head coach John Cherberg. Doll was put in charge of defensive backs for the Huskies. During his one year at Washington, the Huskies had the 10th best passing defense in the country, allowing only 60 yards per game in passing yards. In 1956, Doll accepted a head coaching position at West Contra Costa Junior College. In February 1957, Doll returned to USC as the Trojans' backfield coach under head coach Don Clark. At the time of his hiring, the Los Angeles Times called Doll \\"an all-time SC great\\" and \\"one of the top defensive backs in football history.\\" Doll served as USC's backfield coach during the 1957 and 1958 seasons. He also served as an assistant on the College All-Star coaching staff in 1957 and 1958. In February 1959, Doll was hired by Notre Dame as its backfield coach under head coach Joe Kuharich. Prior to the 1959 game between USC and Notre Dame, Braven Dyer warned in the Los Angeles Times that the man who had \\"mapped SC's secondary defense\\" was \\"now in the camp of the enemy.\\" Notre Dame defeated USC in 1959 by a score of 16-6. Doll was Notre Dame's backfield coach throughout Kuharich's tenure which ended after the 1962 season. In January 1963, Doll was hired by the Detroit Lions as their defensive backfield coach. Doll, who was then 36 years old, replaced Don Shula, who left the Lions coaching staff to become the head coach of the Baltimore Colts. Doll remained the Lions' defensive backfield coach through the 1963 and 1964 NFL seasons. At the end of the 1964 season, Doll was \\"swept out\\" of the Lions organization when team owner William Clay Ford \\"purged the coaching staff.\\" In January 1965, Doll was hired by the Los Angeles Rams as their defensive backfield coach under head coach Harland Svare. Doll remained with the Rams for only one season. In 1966, Doll was hired as an assistant coach for the Washington Redskins under head coach Otto Graham. Doll remained with Redskins as the defensive backfield coach for five years and through three head coaches. In 1969, Vince Lombardi was hired as the Redskins' head coach. Doll served as an assistant coach under Lombardi during the 1969 NFL season, which was Lombardi's last as a coach. Doll also served under Redskins' head coach Bill Austin in 1970. In February 1971, Doll was hired as defensive backfield coach for the Green Bay Packers under head coach Dan Devine. Doll remained with the Packers for three years from 1971 to 1973. He helped mold the Packers' backfield into what The New York Times called \\"one of the National Football League's stingiest pass defenses.\\" In 1972, the Packers had the best pass defense in the NFL. In 1973, the defense lost All-Pro cornerback Willie Buchanon to a broken leg in the sixth game of the season, but still finished as the fifth best pass defense in the NFL. In January 1974, the Packers announced that Doll had resigned \\"because of personal problems\\", but it was later revealed that he was fired by Devine due to a personality conflict and disagreements over defensive strategy. On learning of Doll's departure, Willie Buchanon said, \\"It hurts to get news like this. Not only was he a very good coach, but he was someone who we could relate to and get along with. There aren't many people like that.\\" In February 1974, after undergoing hip surgery, Doll was hired by the Baltimore Colts as defensive coordinator and secondary coach. He served in Baltimore under head coaches Howard Schnellenberger (who was head coach for three games) and Joe Thomas. During the 1974 season, the Colts finished 2-12 and allowed 23.5 points per game (2nd worst in the NFL). In February 1975, Doll resigned from his position with the Colts to accept a position as linebackers coach with Miami Dolphins under head coach Don Shula, who Doll had replaced in Detroit in 1963. Doll served as the Dolphins' linebackers coach during the 1975 and 1976 NFL seasons. The Dolphins finished 10-4 in 1975 and allowed 15.8 points per game (4th best in the NFL). In 1976, the Dolphins dropped to 6-8, allowing 18.8 points per game (ranking 15th out of 28 teams). In January 1977, the Dolphins announced that they were restructuring the defensive coaching staff and would not renew Doll's contract. In February 1977, Doll was hired as a special assignments coach with the San Francisco 49ers. In February 1978, Doll returned to the Detroit Lions as special teams coach and film coordinator. In his second stint as an assistant coach for the Lions, Doll served 11 years from 1978 through 1988. Starting in 1986, he coached the team's tight ends.http://www.fanbase.com/Detroit-Lions-1986/roster In 1988, after 10 years in one city, Doll noted, \\"It's kind of nice, staying in one place for a while.\\" Later years, family and death Doll was married in the early 1950s to Diana Davies, a graduate of UCLA. After their wedding, she became Diana Davies Doll, and Doll joked with a reporter in 1954 that he called her his \\"Triple-D Dynamo.\\" Doll and his wife had five children, Steven, Wendy, Kevan, Heidi and Michael. In his later years, Doll lived with his wife in San Juan Capistrano, California. Doll died at his home in San Juan Capistrano in September 2010 at age 84. He was survived by his wife Diana, five children, six grandchildren and one great grandchild.

The aim is to create deals where the suits are more unevenly distributed between the players, thus creating \\"wild\\" deals in order to make the game more vivid. Goulash dealing has variations; basically, each player sorts the cards from the previous deal by suits, and all four hands are stacked back in the deck. The deck is then cut once or twice, and cards are then dealt in groups of 4-5-4 or 5-5-3, instead of one at a time as usual.

In both cases, at least a game must be bid in the goulash deal, otherwise, the partial (part score) contract is discarded and the goulash redealt. When goulash dealing is in effect, some players adjust their bidding principles in some or all of the following ways in order to accommodate the anticipated wildness of the deal: *Only five-card suits may be bid *Weak balanced hands (in 12-15 high card points range) are passed rather than opened *Preemptive openings are forbidden; instead, a high-level opening bid denotes the exact number of tricks the hand possesses. *Conventions are highly reduced, as opponents will often interfere and break up the subtle information exchange. *Doubles behind a bidder are for penalties, where they would usually be for take out.

Hardstaff's father, Joe senior played for Nottinghamshire and England and his son, also named Joe, played first-class cricket as well. Cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, remarked, \\"Hardstaff was one of the most artistic batsmen ever to set foot on a cricket field but he paid the high price of falling out with Gubby Allen\\". Life and career Hardstaff was born in Nuncargate, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. One of the most elegant middle order batsman of the 1930s, a rich era for English batsmanship, Hardstaff first played for Nottinghamshire at the age of nineteen, and made his name with 1,817 runs in 1934, which led to his Test selection against South Africa the following year. He had a highly successful tour of Australia under Errol Holmes in 1935‚Äì36, scoring over a thousand runs in tour matches in his upright, elegant style, but proved less prolific in the Tests when he returned in 1936‚Äì37. The experience spurred him to further buttress his defensive technique and this, allied with his natural stroke play, led to a fine season at home in 1937, when he posted over 2,500 runs including three double hundreds. He won the Walter Lawrence trophy for the fastest century of the season, in scoring an unbeaten 117 in under an hour, to help defeat Kent in a frenetic run chase and was duly named one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1938. His form did not desert him in the Test matches, he scored 350 runs at 70 against New Zealand, and, after being overlooked for the first two tests in 1938, he stroked 169 at The Oval while Len Hutton broke the world record score. He was surprisingly omitted from the 1938/9 tour to South Africa, but averaged 50 in 1939 and played against the West Indies in the last Test series before World War II. The war robbed him, like so many others, of perhaps his best cricketing years, and his Test appearances were sporadic when cricket resumed, despite a brilliant unbeaten double century against India in 1946. He was chosen for the tour of Australia in 1946‚Äì47, but suffered an injury and played in only one Test, scoring 67 in the first innings. In 1947‚Äì48 Hardstaff toured the West Indies under Gubby Allen's captaincy, but a clash of personalities meant they did not see eye to eye. On their return, Allen assured Hardstaff that he would never play another Test. Hardstaff asked Allen to name his odds and Allen proffered 100‚Äì1, which Hardstaff backed with a five pound note. Hardstaff nevertheless played in the First Test that summer against Australia, and duly received a cheque for ¬£500, which he tore up and posted back to Allen. Hardstaff did not play for England again. He remained a colossus on the county circuit, stroking 2,396 runs at 64.75 in 1947, but retired with just twenty three tests to his name, having scored 1,636 at an average of 46.74. He headed the national averages in 1949 with 2,251 runs at 72.61. The press clamoured for his reinstatement in the national side, but Allen's influence held sway. On Hardstaff's retirement in 1955, he had almost 32,000 runs under his belt at 44.35, one of the highest scoring Nottinghamshire batsman in history, with a century against every county except his own. He recorded eighty three centuries, with ten double hundreds, and passed a thousand runs in a season thirteen times. In addition to three MCC tours to Australia, and one to the West Indies, he also played two seasons of first-class cricket in New Zealand after the war. He was also a fine, athletic outfielder, and took 36 wickets with his eccentric medium pace. (The highest scoring Nottinghamshire batsman was George Gunn who scored 35,208 runs.) Hardstaff's son, who later became the secretary of Middlesex, also confusingly was the third Joe Hardstaff to appear in first-class cricket, when he played for the Free Foresters in the early 1960s. Hardstaff died in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, on the first day of 1990, aged 78.

He played two Test matches for England in 1935 against South Africa. An opening batsman with an excellent batting technique, Barber often batted in the middle order. He scored 16,402 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 34.28 with 29 centuries. Barber made his debut in 1926 and made several appearances over the next few seasons. Despite a sound defence, Barber did not secure a regular first team place until 1932. He scored a thousand runs for the first time that season, a feat he was to achieve eight times, while he scored over 2,000 runs in 1935. Until the Second World War broke out, Barber continued as a regular member of the Yorkshire side. After the war, he played one more full season before retiring in 1947. His career continued in club cricket and he went on to coach local sides before his death in 1968. Career Barber was born on 18 April 1901 in Cleckheaton, Yorkshire. He did not appear for the Yorkshire Second XI until he was 25, in 1926, when he scored 600 runs, including a century, and averaged 40. The same season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Worcestershire without playing a single innings. He was scheduled to bat later in the innings and was not needed to bat as Yorkshire completed an easy victory. In the next season, he was chosen to play three matches, with a top score of 18. For the next few years, he was unable to attain a regular spot in the Yorkshire side as there were many batsmen competing for places. In the 1928 season, Barber played 16 matches, mainly when other batsmen were required in representative matches,Hodgson, p. 122. passing fifty for the first time in an innings of 98 against the West Indians, and followed this with two other fifties. Next season, he scored his maiden first-class century against the South Africans in an innings of 108, out of a team total of 335, with no other batsman reaching fifty. In total, he played on 22 occasions and scored 857 runs at an average of 30.60, including a second century, against Glamorgan. However, Barber was in and out of the side over the next two seasons. He did not play 20 matches or reach 500 runs in either season and passed fifty only four times in total. Matters changed for Barber in the 1932 season, when Yorkshire's regular, long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness. This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack believed that he thoroughly deserved his place in the team as he scored exactly 1,000 runs at an average of 25.64, the first time he reached four figures in a season. He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages, the first time he had been placed so high. His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season. After this breakthrough, Barber steadily improved his total of runs and batting average, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935. In 1933, he scored 1,595 runs at an average of 33.93, and in 1934 he scored 1,927 runs at an average of 40.14. In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages. However, Barber's best season statistically was the following season, 1935, when he achieved his best aggregate of runs and highest average in an English season, passing 2,000 runs in a season for the only time in his career. He scored 2,147 runs at an average of 42.09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages. These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground for the only time in his career, where he scored 61 and 18 not out. Also in 1935, Barber was chosen to represent England in the Test series against South Africa. He played in the third and fourth Tests after England had lost the second match to be 1‚Äì0 down in the series. He was one of six Yorkshire players selected that season. He scored 83 runs in four innings with a highest score of 44 in the fourth Test but England only drew these matches and he was left out of the final game. He also took a wicket with his second (and final) ball in Test cricket, when the match was heading towards an obvious draw. Following these matches, he was chosen to go on the non-Test playing tour by the Marylebone Cricket Club of Australia and New Zealand that winter under the captaincy of Errol Holmes. He was the senior professional but was not as effective as had been expected in Australia. However, in New Zealand he scored 365 runs in the matches against a New Zealand representative team, at an average of 60.83. He scored 797 runs in all first-class matches, average 41.94, including two centuries. Although Barber did not play any more Tests, his scoring was consistent in the four seasons up until World War II. In all but 1936 (he scored 993 runs that year), he scored around 1,500 runs and in all but 1938 (he averaged just under 34), he averaged between 36 and 38. He was second in the Yorkshire batting averages in 1936, fourth in 1937 and 1939 but slipped to sixth in 1938. Following the war, Barber played one more full season, scoring 1,170 runs at an average of 30.00 in 1946 to be fourth in the Yorkshire averages. It was the eighth and final time he passed 1,000 runs in a season. During these seasons, Barber's runs contributed to Yorkshire being County Champions in four consecutive seasons from 1937 to 1939 and then again after the war in 1946. He played a further three matches in 1947 to bring his career to a close. From 1932, when Barber became a regular player, until his last full season in 1946, he was part of a Championship winning side seven times. Style and achievements Barber scored a total of 16,402 runs in his career with 29 hundreds and 182 catches, and was described by Gerald Howat as \\"the fourth pillar\\" of the Yorkshire batting in the mid-1930s (after Herbert Sutcliffe, Maurice Leyland and Arthur Mitchell). A generally defensive batsman, he played carefully in the tradition of Yorkshire opening batsmen. Jim Kilburn said that Barber was \\"small in stature but upright in style\\".Hodgson, p. 123. He was a good batsman on the off side and had a very good defensive technique, while his strength on the leg side was noted on his Test debut. Although an opening batsman, he often went in lower down the batting order. He was more comfortable in normal circumstances than in a crisis and did not enjoy batting on difficult pitches. Bill Bowes called him the most correct and orthodox batsman he had seen, even more so than Len Hutton. Barber was a kind, modest man, who never believed that his contribution was good enough, even if he had scored a century.Bowes, p. 145. On his death, Wisden described him as having \\"rendered admirable service.\\" Barber's highest score was 255 against Surrey in 1935. In this innings, he opened the batting and shared three successive century partnerships. Barber also scored 248 against Kent in 1934. He had scored 73 in the first innings but Kent had built up a lead of 148 on the second day of the match. Barber, opening the batting with Len Hutton, scored 248 and shared a stand of 267 for the first wicket. As a result, Yorkshire drew the game. Barber shared in seven other century opening partnerships Yorkshire, four of them with Arthur Mitchell, and six other 200 partnerships. This included a stand of 346 in four and a half hours with Maurice Leyland, against Middlesex in 1932 which was a record for Yorkshire's second wicket. His fielding, generally done in the deep, was described by Wisden as \\"first rate\\". Bowes said that he once went for nearly three years without dropping a catch on the leg side boundary from his bowling.Bowes, p. 85. Retirement After his retirement, Barber played club cricket into his fifties, playing for Lidget Green and King Cross until 1952. He went on to play for Mirfield in the Central Yorkshire League between 1952 and 1955. There, he was the club's first professional once it reformed in 1952. During his time at the club, Barber scored eleven half centuries and won an award for his batting. After he left Mirfield, he became coach to the North Riding Educational Authorities, later working as coach and groundsman at a school in Harrogate. He died, aged 67, in a hospital in Bradford after a short illness, on 10 September 1968.

This approach can be useful in Deaf education, for young children who are pre- verbal, and for children with language disorders such as apraxia or Autism Spectrum Disorder. In the UK 'Total Communication' (also known as 'Inclusive Communication') is an approach used, mainly by Speech and Language therapists, to help children and adults with learning disabilities communicate using any mode of communication such as symbols, signing (usually Makaton), photographs as well as the spoken and written word and gesture. It has also been found to be useful for those recovering from a stroke or head injury where spoken language is impaired or for people whose language processing is affected, perhaps in old age or through dementia. Total Communication not only helps deaf children learn to communicate but children who have down syndrome and other learning disabilities where it makes communication hard especially for school aged children and the families who are involved. Total Communication focuses on teaching children special tools to help them communicate better like finger spelling, how to use body language to tell people how you feel, sign language, lip reading and other natural gestures to communicate. Total Communication encourages children to use the little bit of hearing they may have to help make this process work better, with the help of hearing aids and other different kind of implants. Not being able to communicate can be very frustrating, this can cause behavior problems when a child is not able to communicate what he or she needs. Total Communication uses both a visual aspect and hearing to help children communicate. When a child is in a classroom setting the teacher and the students may be speaking and using sign language at the same time. This is called simultaneous communication, this form of communication works best in a classroom setting. Teachers who teach these types of classes always emphasize learning the language first. These programs follow the sign language system based on the English system. Some things to always remember when using total communication is that some children may process things at a slower pace, this mean you might have to wait up to 10 seconds to get an answer. The use of yes and no and short answer question are usually the best when asking questions that only require one answer a yes or no. Using print like pictures or symbols can also really help children understand what you are trying to say. Total Communication includes: art music taste objects touch hearing written words signed words vocalizations contextual clues Total Communication along with sign and spoken language can be very effective when they are used together. To really help a child you need to understand his or her strengths and weaknesses. History An approach very similar to Total Communication was developed by David Denton at the Maryland School for the Deaf in 1967. The term \\"Total Communication\\", though, and its specific philosophy, was first used by Roy Holcomb in California.Holcomb, R. K. (1970). The Total Approach: Beginning and structure. In R. Madebrink (Ed.) (1972). Proceedings of the International Congress on Education of the Deaf, Stockholm, 1970.. Stockholm, Sweden: International Congress on Education of the Deaf, pp. 104-107.Nagengast, Larry. (1973) Deafness no handicap to newcomer. The Morning News (September 4, 1973), p. 11. It was adopted by the Maryland school as the official name for their educational philosophy. TC was supposed to find a middle ground in age-old disputes between oralism and manualism, and as an alternative to Simultaneous Communication. In practice, however, most Total Communication programs use some form of Simultaneous Communication. Total Communication educational programs have been established in the UK, France, U.S., China, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, France, Germany and elsewhere. In the United States, TC was most popular during the 1970s and 1980s, when most schools and programs for children who are Deaf, as well as most major organizations in the field supported the TC philosophy. Today, the debate seems to be between TC programs and bilingual-bicultural education. There is little research concerning that the use of total communication in child centers or his or her own natural environment . TC's original intent was to provide children with the communication tools needed for children to develop complete language. But in later years the philosophy of TC has often been over-simplified and has been confused with simultaneous communication.

Read, who received his nickname from the eccentric leap in his long run-upMcKinstry, Leo; Jack Hobbs: England's Greatest Cricketer, p. 361 was regarded as the fastest bowler in the world for the brief period he was able to play first-class cricket, and though he could be extremely erratic in length he was still an extremely dangerous bowler on a lively pitch. Although a capable fast bowler, Read‚Äôs brief career was sufficient to show him among the very worst ‚Äúrabbits‚Äù in the history of first-class cricket. At one point in 1935 he played eight successive runless innings, and overall ‚ÄúHopper‚Äù scored in just 22 of the 58 innings he played in England. For Read‚Äôs whole career his runs totalled almost thirty percent less than his aggregate of wickets at a batting average that remains the lowest of any cricketer ever to play for his country. The only other Test cricketers with a first-class average of under four runs an innings are New Zealander Chris Martin, South African Alf Hall and Glamorgan paceman Jeff Jones. Originally from Winchester College, Read never went up to either Oxford or Cambridge University but his reputation as a fast bowler in club cricket was such that Surrey gave him a trial against those two Universities in 1933 even though he never claimed qualification to represent Surrey in County Championship matches. Although he took 4 for 26 in the second innings against Cambridge, Surrey did not think it worth having Read properly qualify for them and they raised no objections when Essex asked if he might be available. Read was obviously qualified for Essex: not only was he born there but his father, Arthur Holcombe ‚ÄúArnold‚Äù Read, had played 22 games for their first eleven between 1904 and 1910. Read played only one match for Essex in 1933 and took none for 56, but the following year, coming into the team after Kent had punished the Essex bowling for 803 runs at the cost of only four wickets, he caused a sensation. In his first over, he knocked off the cap of Jack Hobbs ‚Äì in his last season of first-class cricket ‚Äì and then bowled him. On a good pitch, Read‚Äôs speed caused him to carry all before him with seven wickets for 35. Although his training as a chartered accountant made his appearances limited, he still took 69 wickets at an average better than any fast bowler except Larwood and his Essex compatriot Ken Farnes. For the Gentlemen against the Players at Folkestone in September Read took in two innings nine wickets for 171 runs, and Wisden opined that Read was the ‚Äúfind of the season‚Äù.Southerton, Sydney J. (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack, Seventy-Second Edition (1935); part ii, p. 265 In 1935, Read‚Äôs profession prevented him playing any cricket until mid-June but when he entered the Essex side, he immediately clicked. Despite the fact that Farnes could not help him owing to injury, Read and Stan Nichols stood alone as a pace-bowling duoBrookes, Wilfrid H. (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack, Seventy-Third Edition (1936); part ii, p. 270 and in a sensational match at Huddersfield, their sheer pace off the pitch bowled out the otherwise unbeaten Yorkshire eleven for 31 and 99, giving Essex a win by an innings and 204 runs.Brookes; John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack (1936); part ii, p. 120 This performance led to him being chosen for the last Test match against a strong South African side. On a shirt-front pitch, Read bowled very well to take six wickets ‚Äì all of recognised batsmen. He was chosen for a tour led by Errol Holmes to Australia and New Zealand but his form there was variable ‚Äì though he did take 11 for 100 against a New Zealand XI at Dunedin. However, Read's employers at this time became so angry at his absence from duties as a chartered accountant that they threatened to sack him if he continued to play three-day cricket in the season of 1936. Consequently, the tour was the end of Read‚Äôs career in first-class cricket apart from one match in 1948 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Ireland. Essex ‚Äì who with Farnes and Read in tandem would have had the two fastest bowlers in the world and potentially the fastest attack of any county side in history ‚Äì were never able to see what the potential of the two together would have been as they only were able to play together in one match on a slow wicket at the Wagon Works Ground against Gloucestershire in late 1934. Read did play in club cricket on Saturdays for Englefield Green and The Butterflies for many years after he was no longer able to play three-day matches.

Premiering in 1995, the programme is based on the British series Jimmy's which was filmed at St James's University Hospital in Leeds.  Format  For the majority of its thirteen-year run, each episode of RPA would run for half an hour. However, its initial 2007 run was broadcast in combined hour-long episodes, and its return later in the year saw it assume a permanent one-hour timeslot.Nine stretches out a good thing Operations would be recorded on camera in a graphic nature and the doctors would provide commentary as they operate on patients. A new RPA: Where Are They Now series, begun in 2007, ran for half an hour. It profiled the lives of patients who have previously appeared on RPA, recapping the original stories and showing follow-ups on the patients' lives or deaths following their initial appearance on the programme. Both series have been narrated by Max Cullen. A brand-new series of the medical/observational series aired on the Nine Network in October 2008. Max Cullen continued to narrate. The program returned in February 2009 for another brand new series. In 2012, the series returned to Nine on Wednesday, 30 May, at 9.30pm, with Australian actor and artist, Max Cullen again narrating.

They cover the Harrisburg, Lancaster and York metropolitan areas as well as most of the area generally known as Pennsylvania Dutch Country‚Äîcovering an area of nearly two million people. The main area code, 717, was one of the original area codes established in 1947. It originally covered the eastern half of the state except for the Delaware and Lehigh valleys, which were in area code 215. It stretched from the Maryland border to the south to the New York and New Jersey borders, making it the largest of Pennsylvania's original four plan areas and the second-largest east of the Mississippi River that did not cover an entire state, after Michigan's 616. Despite the presence of five of the state's 15 largest cities (Harrisburg, Lancaster, York, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre), this part of Pennsylvania is not as densely populated as the Delaware and Lehigh Valleys. As a result, 717 remained unchanged for 41 years. For nearly all of this time, it was the largest numbering plan area on the Eastern Seaboard. It was pushed slightly eastward in 1994 as part of the split of Philadelphia's 215, when a few towns in eastern Lancaster County and western Chester County that were slated to transfer to area code 610 were instead shifted to 717. These areas were served by non-Bell companies who wanted to consolidate their eastern Pennsylvania subscriber base into a single area code. By the mid-1990s, 717 was on the brink of exhaustion due to the proliferation of cell phones, pagers, and fax machines, particularly in Harrisburg, Lancaster, York, and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. On 5 December 1998, the northern portion of the old 717 territory, centered on Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and Williamsport, received area code 570. As of May 2005, the subscriber number pool of 717 was allocated by 52%. The Pennsylvania Utility Commission determined in 2010 that 717 would likely exhaust by the second quarter of 2018. Under consideration for relief were overlaying 717 with a second area code, or a split along an east-west boundary. An overlay would have required ten-digit dialing, though all customers with an existing 717 number would have been able to keep it. A split would have preserved seven-digit dialing. Most of those who testified in a public hearing supported an overlay as a cost-effective solution that would have spared customers the expense and burden of changing their numbers. In October 2016, an overlay area code, 223, was approved, to become effective in 2017. Since August 26, 2017, 10-digit dialing is mandatory. The 223 area code became available for number assignment as of September 25, 2017.Flyer GT185817PA-HF, Verizon bill enclosure. The implementation of 223 broke seven- digit dialing in the eastern half of Pennsylvania. The only portion of the Commonwealth that has not been overlaid to date is 814. Service area Area code 717 (and 223, starting September 26, 2017) serve parts of sixteen counties in Pennsylvania.http://www.puc.state.pa.us/telecom/pdf/areacode/717_ACMap.pdf * Adams County * Berks County (portions of west) * Chester County (extreme western portion) * Cumberland County * Dauphin County * Franklin County * Fulton County (all except some western portions) * Huntingdon County (Kishacoquillas Valley only) * Juniata County * Lancaster County (all except a portion of its extreme NE) * Lebanon County (all except a portion of its extreme SE) * Mifflin County (all except a portion of its extreme SW) * Perry County * Schuylkill County (Tower City is the only town assigned the 717 area code, The rest of the county is 570/272, with some portions in 610/484) * Snyder County (portions of south) * York County See also * List of Pennsylvania area codes * List of NANP area codes  Citations   General sources  * Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission * North American Numbering Council External links * North American Numbering Plan Administration * Map * List of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 717 Area Code 717 717 Category:Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1947 ","title":"Area codes 717 and 223"},{"id":"3664425","text":"Nancy Moran (born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States) is an American folk-rock singer-songwriter, based in Nashville, Tennessee.

A specialist batsman, he achieved little in those four matches, but might have had a much more substantial Test career, had he not lost six of what should have been his best years to World War II. Colin Bateman, a cricket writer, noted that \\"Fishlock, a good county performer, was astonishingly unlucky when his Test chance did come along... A forcing left-hander, he went on two Ashes tours (1936‚Äì37) and (1946‚Äì47) and suffered hand injuries both times, restricting him to one Test overseas\\". Cricket career He joined the staff of Surrey in 1930, and made his first-class debut the following season. However, he did not play in a substantial number of matches until 1934, when he made 598 runs with an average of 31.47. In 1935 he was a regular member of the side and passed 1,000 runs for the first time, and scored his first three hundreds. The following year he came right to the fore. He made 2,129 runs at an average of 53.22. He was selected for the Players at Lord's, played in two Test trials and was selected for two Tests against India. He was selected for the following winter's tour of Australia, but missed six weeks through a broken bone in his right hand, and thus missed his chance to press for a Test place. During the 1937 season, he switched to opening the batting for Surrey, and occupied that batting position for most of the remainder of his career. He continued to score heavily, and was selected for a Test trial in 1938, in which he made a hundred, but even so could not force his way into the Test team. He had trained as an engineer, and during World War II he made aircraft parts for the RAF. After the war, he had a fine season in 1946, with 2,241 runs at an average of 50.47. As a result, he played in one Test against India and was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1947 edition. He went on the 1946-7 tour of Australia and played in his fourth and final Test. In 1948 he made his highest score, 253 against Leicestershire at Grace Road, Leicester. In his final season of 1952, when he was 45 years old, he still made his 1,000 runs and helped Surrey to win the Championship, the first of their record sequence of seven victories. Later he was a coach at Trinity School of John Whitgift, Croydon and St Dunstan's College. Football career Fishlock also played professional football as a winger, including three seasons (1929‚Äì1932) with Crystal Palace (19 senior appearances, two goals), one season (1933‚Äì34) with Millwall (36 senior appearances, seven goals) and two with Southampton (1934‚Äì1936). Prior to turning professional, he had played for Dulwich Hamlet and in amateur international fixtures for England. He played professionally for Aldershot and Gillingham. Death Laurie Fishlock died in hospital following an operation, in Sutton, London, in June 1986, aged 79.

The competition involved teams competing to gain points by delivering balls into goals and positioning their robots in certain positions on the playing field. The teams took it in turn to provide defense and attack. Game description Aim High field. Aim High is played by two alliances, red and blue, each consisting of three robots. During a 10-second autonomous mode robots are programmed to score into any of the three goals: one raised center goal marked by a green vision target and two corner goals at floor level. At the end of the autonomous period the alliance with the most points will gain a 10-point bonus and will be placed on defense for round two. Rounds two, three and four are each 40 seconds long and are human-controlled rounds. Between rounds two and three the alliances switch from offense to defense or vice versa. At the start of round 4 any alliance can score into the corresponding goals. At the end of the match any alliance can receive bonus points by placing its three robots on a platform below the center goal. The alliance with the most points wins with scoring as follows: 3 points for any ball scored in the center goal, 1 point for any ball scored in the corner goals, 10 bonus points for scoring the highest in the autonomous round and 25 points for placing all 3 robots on the platform at the end (10 points for 2 robots and 5 points for 1 robot). =Field layout= The Aim High field has 6 goals and 2 platforms. Unlike previous years an alliance's goals are on the far side of the field. The field is flat and measures long by wide. =Alliance station= The alliance station wall is long and stretches the width of the field. The middle of the alliance station wall is made of \\"diamond plate\\" aluminum from the floor to high with clear acrylic filling the rest of the . The outer edges of the wall consist of transparent polycarbonate. Above each alliance station there is a circular goal (the center goal), with a green light above it. The green light is used so that the CMUcam can lock onto it. On the bottom left and right of each alliance station there are two rectangular holes, the corner goals, through which balls can be maneuvered to receive points. In front of each alliance station there is a raised platform. Tournament structure The tournament structure of this competition is the same as in previous years. In the regional competitions teams were given access to their robots on the Thursday of the competition weekend. It is a practice day giving each team a number of practice rounds on the regulation playing field. Friday and the morning of Saturday is dedicated to a series of qualification rounds. Each team competed in around seven to ten matches. The number of wins by a team in these matches determines the team's ranking. Before a lunch break on Saturday the top eight teams from the qualification rounds are asked, in order from the top-seeded team to the eighth seed, to select an alliance of three robots. In contrast to previous years this order reverses for the second selection round and the eighth seed picks first and then backwards to the first seed. This was instituted to make the finals more competitive and balanced compared to previous years. After the lunch break the finals take place. This is a standard-elimination tournament bracket starting with alliance 1 facing alliance 8, alliance 2 facing alliance 7, and so on. At the end of the finals the last remaining alliance is declared the winner and all three teams are given the right to attend the national competition. Kit of Parts There were several changes in the kit of parts in 2006: * The inclusion of the National Instruments LabVIEW program * CMUcam II, including a pan/tilt assembly with servos, designed to follow an illuminated target * A new robot controller based on the PIC18F8722 instead of the PIC18F8520 * A new EasyC programming tool * New wider CIM motors with drive belts * New smaller Window motors * A new smaller and lighter backup battery charger * An Infrared transmitter and receiver (for broken beam detection) * A Digital camera and Picasa software donated by Google Rules *Intentionally damaging another robot or the playing field is not allowed. *No balls may exit the robot at a velocity greater than . *The shooter mechanism must remain within the dimensions of by by tall. Intentionally \\"flopping\\" to drive or score with the dimension on the ground is prohibited. *No part of the robot may extend more than above the floor. If a robot is more than high and it shoots a ball, or blocks a ball from being shot, a 5-point penalty per ball will be applied. *Power supplies are limited to compressed air, a 12-volt motorcycle battery, and a 7.2-volt RC battery Robots There were many viable tactics in Aim High. There were ball dumpers, floor shooters, ramp shooters and defensive robots. =Ball dumpers= The primary aim of a ball dumper is to collect balls that are either loaded into it via the human players or that it collects off of the floor. The ball dumper then moves to one of the lower goals and dumps all the balls into the lower goal for a significant amount of 1-point goals. Ball dumpers can be made to be very reliable in autonomous, as they do not depend on aiming and are difficult to block with an opposing ramming robot from across the field. Ball dumping teams must deal with defensive robots attempting to block their transit to and from the human loading zone, as well as teams that may simply block the lower goals to prevent them from dumping. =Floor shooters= Team 573's floor shooter Floor shooters are the more common of the two shooter varieties. A majority fire mainly from a few feet in front of the ramp. Some (often referred to as ranged shooters, perimeter shooters or distant shooters) can fire from half the court distance or more. Floor shooters, especially those that fire from near the ramp, must contend with great amounts of defense to block their shots and dislocate them from shooting positions. A wide variety of shooting mechanisms can be found on floor shooters including two horizontally mounted spinning discs, two vertically mounted (for the allowance of backspin), and singular mount spinning discs with a curved output track. Many use the CMUCam to some extent while shooting and a few even had automated turrets that automatically locked onto the target. =Ramp shooters= Ramp shooters are robots that use the height of the ramp to greatly reduce the distance that they must propel the ball. Ramp shooters drive up to their wall and fire balls through a high- mounted shooting mechanism that is statically aimed directly at the goal. Ramp shooters have a disadvantage from floor shooters as they must traverse the ramp, risking tipping, and can only shoot from one location directly in front of the goal. Defense against a ramp shooter is simply to sit in position on top of the ramp, or keep them from getting up the ramp. =Defense= Since scoring in the high goal in \\"Aim High\\" is difficult and as there are specific offense and defense periods defense plays a very large role. An effective defense prevents their opponents from gathering balls, dumping balls and shooting balls. A defensive robot is involved in a great deal of ramming and pushing and must have a very strong and durable drivetrain. A low centre of mass is a key asset so that the robot may play up and down the ramp without worry of tipping. In order to prevent robots from scoring a robot playing defense will attempt to attack the corners of the shooting robot causing it to spin. A few defensive bots had nets, walls or other defensive mechanisms to block shots.

He most recently played with Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He previously played for four different National Hockey League (NHL) teams. Mason currently serves as the colour analyst covering Predators games broadcast on FOX Sports Tennessee. Playing career While completing a junior career in the Western Hockey League (WHL) with the Prince George Cougars, Mason was originally drafted 122nd overall in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. Embarking on his professional career and un-signed from the Devils, Mason signed as a free agent by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on June 27, 1997. After his rookie professional season with the Ducks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks, and on the eve of his sophomore season, Mason was traded by Anaheim along with Marc Moro to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Dominic Roussel. Mason made his debut in the NHL with the Predators during the 1998‚Äì99 season, relieving in three games. After a further three seasons within the Predators organization, Mason left as a free agent and signed a contract with the Florida Panthers. Mason was assigned to Florida's AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage, for the duration of the 2002‚Äì03 season. He re-signed with the Panthers to a one-year extension, however he never featured for the club before he was claimed in the 2003 NHL waiver draft to return to the Nashville Predators. In the 2003‚Äì04 season, Mason joined the Predators full-time as the backup to starter Tom√°≈° Vokoun. In 17 appearances that season, Mason finished with a 4‚Äì4‚Äì1 record with a 2.18 goals against average (GAA) and .926 save percentage. During the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, Mason played for V√•lerenga Ishockey in the Norwegian league with fellow Predator Scott Hartnell. Being hailed as the best goalie in the league ever, he played a big part in V√•lerenga securing their 25th league championship and their 24th Norwegian Championship by winning the playoffs. On April 15, 2006, when he was starting because starting goaltender Vokoun was lost for the year with a blood condition, Mason was credited for a goal when Phoenix Coyotes forward Geoff Sanderson shot the puck into his own net. Mason became the ninth NHL goaltender to score a goal and joined Damian Rhodes as the only goalies to be credited with a goal in both the AHL and the NHL. In response, Mason said, \\"It was a cheesy goal. Someone else should have received it.\\" In the off-season of 2007, Vokoun was traded to the Florida Panthers for a few draft picks, leaving Mason as the starter for Nashville, alone with backup goaltender Dan Ellis. Mason quickly won the first two games, the collective scores of which were 9‚Äì1 in favor of the Predators, but then dropped a startling seven straight games. Dan Ellis, however, was able to step up for the Predators and win four straight. Mason returned to play against the Detroit Red Wings in a 43-save loss. The loss was no surprise, but Mason did show that he could effectively remain the Nashville starter, and continued to start for the remainder of his time with the Predators. Mason at the 2008 Blues FanFest. Mason was traded to the St. Louis Blues in the 2008 off-season. On June 20, 2008, Mason was traded by the Predators to the St. Louis Blues for a fourth round draft pick. In two seasons as the Blues number one goalie, Mason appeared in career high 61 and 57 games, to post 27 and 30 wins respectively. On July 1, 2010, Mason left the Blues and signed a two-year, $3.7 million deal with the Atlanta Thrashers, marking the first time in his NHL career that Mason played for an Eastern Conference team. Mason's 2010‚Äì11 campaign was a disappointment, as it marked the first time in his career that he posted a GAA above 3.00. Following the team's relocation, Mason played out the second season of his contract for the Winnipeg Jets. On July 1, 2012, Mason returned for a third stint with the Nashville Predators, on a one-year deal to serve as the team's backup goalie. During the lockout shortened 2012‚Äì13 season, Mason was unable to recapture his earlier career form posting a career low goals against and save percentage. With limited NHL interest at season's end, Mason signed abroad in Italy to a one-year contract with Ritten-Renon of the Elite.A on August 6, 2013. After a successful season in Italy, on May 23, 2014, he moved to Germany to sign a one-year contract with the Augsburger Panther of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). On September 21, 2015, Mason announced his retirement from professional hockey and that he would be joining the Nashville Predators Radio Network as a colour commentator for select games during the 2015‚Äì16 season. International play Mason made his international debut with Canada at the 2006 World Championships but did not play. He won a gold medal with team Canada at the 2007 World Championships as a third goaltender. He played his first game at the 2009 World Championships in Switzerland where he went 4‚Äì0 with a 1.00 GAA, and helped Canada to a silver medal. Based on the strong performance in 2009 World Championships and in the NHL regular season leading up to the Olympics, Mason was selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics as a stand-by goaltender should an injury occur. He would play as the starting goaltender at the 2010 World Championships in Germany, where they lost against Team Russia in the quarter-finals. Mason also played for Team Canada at the 2013 Spengler Cup.

He was known for dramas and Western adventures, the two most acclaimed of these being Broken Arrow (1950) and 3:10 to Yuma (1957). In addition, Daves worked with some of the best known actors of the time; a few would make several movies with him, including Gary Cooper, Glenn Ford, Richard Egan, Alan Ladd, Troy Donahue, Ernest Borgnine, and Rossano Brazzi. He also launched soon-to-be-stars such as Anne Bancroft, Olivia Hussey, George C. Scott, Sandra Dee, and Charles Bronson. Life and career =Early life= Born in San Francisco, Delmer Daves first pursued a career as a lawyer. While attending Stanford University, he became interested in the burgeoning film industry, first working as a prop boy on the western The Covered Wagon (1923), directed by James Cruze and serving as a technical advisor on a number of films. After finishing his education in law, he continued his career in Hollywood. =Screenwriter and actor at MGM= After moving to Hollywood in 1928, he became a screenwriter at MGM, his first credit being the early sound comedy film So This Is College (1929), directed by Sam Wood. It was the film debut of Robert Montgomery. Daves also moonlighted as an actor making small appearances in films like The Night Flyer (1928) (produced by Cruze), Three Sinners (1928), and several films directed by Cruze: The Mating Call (1928), Excess Baggage (1928), The Duke Steps Out (1929), and A Man's Man (1929), as well as So This Is College (1929), which he wrote. Daves appeared in The Bishop Murder Case (1930) and Good News (1930). He wrote and appeared in Shipmates (1931) and Divorce in the Family (1931) and worked uncredited on Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931) and Slim (1931). Daves then focused on writing, working on scripts for Clear All Wires! (1933) at MGM, and No More Women (1934) at Paramount. =Warners= Daves signed a contract at Warner Bros. where he initially wrote musicals: Dames (1934) and Flirtation Walk (1934). He followed this with Stranded (1935), Page Miss Glory (1935, for Cosmopolitan Pictures), Shipmates Forever (1935), and Miss Pacific Fleet (1935). Daves' first really significant credit as screenwriter was The Petrified Forest (1936) adapted from the play by Robert E. Sherwood. He wrote The Go Getter (1937), The Singing Marine (1937), She Married an Artist (1938) (over at Columbia) and Professor Beware (1938) for Harold Lloyd at Paramount Pictures. He worked uncredited on Slim (1937). Daves had a big critical and commercial success with Love Affair (1939) for RKO. (Almost twenty years later, Leo McCarey, director of Love Affair, was responsible for the nearly identical An Affair to Remember (1957) using Daves' script.) He was very much in demand as a writer, his credits including two films at Paramount, $1000 a Touchdown (1939) and The Farmer's Daughter (1940). He did It All Came True (1940) at Warners and Safari (1940) at Paramount. Daves wrote a propaganda short, Young America Flies (1940) then did Unexpected Uncle (1941) at RKO, The Night of January 16th (1941) at Paramount, and You Were Never Lovelier (1942) at Columbia. He also helped write Stage Door Canteen (1943), a huge hit for Warners. =Director= Daves made his directorial debut in the Cary Grant wartime adventure Destination Tokyo (1943). He followed it with The Very Thought of You (1944), Hollywood Canteen (1944), and Pride of the Marines (1945). All these films were very successful commercially. Daves was a writer only on Ladies' Man (1947). He wrote and directed The Red House (1947) for Sol Lesser at United Artists. Back at Warners he wrote and directed Dark Passage (1947), which utilized a first-person approach and starred Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. He directed Richard Brooks' script in To the Victor (1948), directed A Kiss in the Dark (1949) and wrote and directed Task Force (1949) with Gary Cooper. =20th Century Fox= In February 1949, Daves signed a long-term contract at 20th Century Fox. He directed the critically acclaimed Broken Arrow (1950) at 20th Century Fox, which made a star of Jeff Chandler. He wrote and directed Bird of Paradise (1951) at Fox; directed Return of the Texan (1952); and wrote and directed Treasure of the Golden Condor (1953) at Fox. As director, he only did Never Let Me Go (1953) at MGM and Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954) under contract. He returned to Warners to write, produce and directed Drum Beat (1954) with Alan Ladd, for Ladd's company. Daves was a writer only on White Feather (1955) for Fox. He wrote and directed Jubal (1956) at Columbia and The Last Wagon (1956) at Fox. He directed two films at Columbia, 3:10 to Yuma (1957) at Columbia and Cowboy (1958). Daves garnered a Directors Guild of America Award nomination for his work on Cowboy. He also directed Kings Go Forth (1958) for United Artists, The Badlanders (1958) with Ladd at MGM and The Hanging Tree (1959). =Delmer Daves Productions= Daves wrote, produced and directed a series of films with Troy Donahue at Warners: A Summer Place (1959), Parrish (1961), Susan Slade (1961) and Rome Adventure (1962). Following the success of A Summer Place, Daves's career made an unexpected and profound shift away from the masculine action films Daves had become known for towards so-called \\"women's pictures.\\" ¬ó According to Daves's son, Michael Daves, this change was precipitated partly by Daves's heart attack in 1958; on his doctors‚Äô advice, he decided to limit himself to less strenuous, studio-based productions. Daves final films were all at Warners Spencer's Mountain (1963), Youngblood Hawke (1964) and The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965). Spencer's Mountain (1963), which he wrote, directed, and produced, based upon Earl Hamner Jr's autobiographical novel of the same name, and served as the basis for the later television series The Waltons. Daves was married to actress Mary Lawrence from 1938 until he died on August 17, 1977. He is interred at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery. Legacy Despite highly acclaimed films such as The Red House, Dark Passage, 3:10 to Yuma and The Hanging Tree, a growing number of film historians such as Dave Kehr consider him to be an underrated and neglected filmmaker. \\"Many of Delmer Daves's films are beloved\\", writes Kent Jones, \\"but to say that he remains a misunderstood and insufficiently appreciated figure in the history of American movies is a rank understatement.\\" As a director, he first built his reputation on morally complex war films (such as Pride of the Marines) and socially progressive westerns. For example, his film Broken Arrow has been credited as one of the first to introduce the issue of racism in postwar American movies, and it is widely regarded as one of the first \\"pro-Native American\\" films. Many view his celebrated late period romances as sharing the same virtues as his earlier action films: \\"characters composed with the utmost integrity and respect; a gift for creating a detailed and convincing social background; and a strong, clear narrative style that allowed him to manage a large cast of characters and several simultaneous levels of dramatic events.\\" Partial filmography * Queen Kelly (1929, writer ‚Äì uncredited) * The Duke Steps Out (1929) * So This Is College (1929, screenplay) * The Bishop Murder Case (1929) as Raymond Sperling * Shipmates (1931, adaptation and dialogue) * Dames (1934, writer) * Flirtation Walk (1934, writer) * Page Miss Glory (1935, writer) * The Petrified Forest (1936, adaptation) * The Go Getter (1937, writer) * Love Affair (1939, writer) * Night of January 16th (1941, co-writer with Robert Pirosh) * You Were Never Lovelier (1942, writer) * Stage Door Canteen (1943, writer) * Destination Tokyo (1943, director and writer) * The Very Thought of You (1944, director and writer) * Hollywood Canteen (1944, director and writer) * The Red House (1947, director and writer) * Dark Passage (1947, director and writer) * Task Force (1949, director and writer) * A Kiss in the Dark (1949, director) * Broken Arrow (1950, director) * Bird of Paradise (1951, director and writer) * Treasure of the Golden Condor (1953 director and co-writer) * Never Let Me Go (1953, director) * Drum Beat (1954, director, writer, and producer) * Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954, director) * White Feather (1955, writer) * The Last Wagon (1956, director and writer) * Jubal (1956, director and writer) * 3:10 to Yuma (1957, director) * An Affair to Remember (1957, writer) * Cowboy (1958, director) * Kings Go Forth (1958, director) * The Badlanders (1958, director) * The Hanging Tree (1959, director) * A Summer Place (1959, director, writer, and producer) * Parrish (1961, director, writer, and producer) * Rome Adventure (1962, director, co- writer, producer) * Spencer's Mountain (1963, director, writer, and producer) * Youbgblood Hawke (1964, director, writer) * The Battle of the Villa Fiorita (1965, director, producer, writer) References External links * * Delmer Daves at Virtual History * Delmer Daves Papers, 1930‚Äì1965 (38.5 linear ft.) are housed in the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Stanford University Libraries Category:American male screenwriters Category:Film producers from California Category:Western (genre) film directors Category:Writers from San Francisco Category:1904 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Category:Stanford University alumni Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:Film directors from San Francisco Category:Screenwriters from California Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Delmer Daves"},{"id":"3664516","text":"Jonathan Lear is the John U.

Some accumulators accept energy at a low rate (low power) over a long time interval and deliver the energy at a high rate (high power) over a short time interval. Some accumulators accept energy at a high rate over a short time interval and deliver the energy at a low rate over longer time interval. Some accumulators typically accept and release energy at comparable rates. Various devices can store thermal energy, mechanical energy, and electrical energy. Energy is usually accepted and delivered in the same form. Some devices store a different form of energy than what they receive and deliver performing energy conversion on the way in and on the way out. Examples of accumulators include steam accumulators, mainsprings, flywheel energy storage, hydraulic accumulators, rechargeable batteries, capacitors, compensated pulsed alternators (compulsators), and pumped-storage hydroelectric plants. In general usage in an electrical context, the word accumulator normally refers to a lead‚Äìacid battery. The London Tower Bridge is operated via an accumulator. The original raising mechanism was powered by pressurised water stored in several hydraulic accumulators. In 1974, the original operating mechanism was largely replaced by a new electro-hydraulic drive system.

It runs south-southwest for two kilometres from The Octagon in the city centre to the Oval sports ground, close to the city's Southern Cemetery. North of The Octagon, George Street continues the line of Princes Street north-northeast for two and a half kilometres. Princes Street is straight and undulates as it skirts the edge of the City Rise to its northwest. The part of the street immediately below The Octagon is the steepest section, as the road traverses an old cutting through Bell Hill. Princes Street was developed during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the Central Otago gold rush, and consequently is one of New Zealand's most historic streets, with about 70 buildings in close proximity listed on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Register. Originally the site of the city's wharf, a substantial area of land to the east of the street was formerly part of Otago Harbour, much of it reclaimed via rock removed during the lowering of Bell Hill which separated Princes Street from northern Dunedin in the early years of settlement. In the years following the gold rush, Princes Street was the heart of Dunedin's central business district, but much of the city's main retail area has now shifted north to George Street. History In the early years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of reasonably flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain of the Water of Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names and that of the Water of Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.\\"Dunedin's Scottish heritage\\", Dunedin City Council website. Retrieved 5 November 2010. In the settlement's early days, Bell Hill proved a major obstacle to travel south of the city centre, and major excavation work was carried out to provide access to the south. A cutting was made in the hill in 1858, and during the 1860s the hill was lowered by some . The cutting allowed for the passage of transport between the two parts of the town. The southern flank of the hill was also completely removed (that area now being occupied by Queen's Gardens). The stone removed from the hill was used as construction material for many of the city's first permanent buildings, and also as fill to reclaim the northern end of the Southern Endowment along the edge of the harbour. This reclamation work added a considerable area to the central city; the original docks, close to the Exchange area of Princes Street, are now several hundred metres inland. The area of Princes Street between the Exchange and Market Reserve was a frequent source of dispute in the early years of European settlement. This area, at that time on the foreshore of Otago Harbour was a traditional landing site for MƒÅori waka. Captain Cargill, the founder of the new city, wished to follow the British practice of keeping the foreshore as public land. As the town spread, the area around the landing site became populated by settlers, and visiting Maori relied on the coastal strip as a place to set up their encampments. The southern Commissioner for Crown Lands, Walter Mantell noted the problem and proposed to his superiors in Wellington that a site be found at which the MƒÅori could erect permanent structures, naming the Princes Street foreshore as the preferred site. Mantell and Cargill, who had been bitter political opponents for the control of the early settlement, quickly found themselves at loggerheads over the proposal, and disputes over the ownership and allocation of the land dragged on for over two decades, finally being settled in the courts in 1877. In the years following the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s Dunedin grew rapidly, with much of the growth being centred on Princes Street. In the city's early years this road was notorious for its unformed rough nature, a consequence of the work on Bell Hill, and led to Dunedin's early nickname of \\"Mud-edin\\". The prosperity brought by the gold rush led to a boom in construction, and within a handful of years, the area around lower Princes Street became the most prosperous in the country. Many of the prominent grand buildings of this part of Dunedin date from this period, and numerous structures in the area have New Zealand Historic Places Trust classification as a result. There is a considerable photographic record of early Princes Street, largely thanks to the presence in the street of the studios of the Burton Brothers, pioneering New Zealand photographers. Many of their images, and those of other early Dunedin photographers, were collated and published in a series of books by photographic historian Hardwicke Knight, one of which ‚Äî a collection of photographic works by Daniel Louis Mundy ‚Äî was entitled Princes Street by gaslight (1977).Details of this book at OpenLibrary.com Several notable companies have either been founded or had their headquarters in Princes Street. Notable among these were The Drapery and General Importing Company of New Zealand, later simply known as The D.I.C., Hallenstein's, and H.E. Shacklock. The first New Zealand headquarters of Briscoes were also located on Princes Street. Route =The \\"Top 100\\"= Central Dunedin. Princes Street (4) is marked in red, with the 4 placed at the location of John Wickliffe Plaza. From the Octagon, Princes Street initially rises as it passes through a commercial district formerly commonly known as the Top 100, crossing the outer Octagon of Moray Place before descending through the original cutting of Bell Hill towards the Exchange. The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the Octagon to the Exchange, although the actual number of businesses is not one hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from Moray Place to Rattray Street. Some parts of the Bell Hill cutting are still visible from Princes Street, though the most obvious escarpment of the hill is found between Moray Place and Queen's Gardens, close to First Church. From Princes Street, the most notable part of the cutting is at Dowling Street, 300 metres south of the Octagon. Dowling Street narrows significantly above this intersection. The Dowling Street Steps, a 1926 structure listed by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, rise from close to the Princes Street-Dowling Street intersection, ascending a cliff that was formed as a result of the original work on Bell Hill. =The Exchange= William Mason and demolished in the 1960s to make way for John Wickliffe House, gave the area its name The Exchange, on Princes Street 400 metres south of The Octagon, was the original financial heart of the city, but the CBD has drifted north to its current location on George Street. Princes Street still contains many of the city's older and more stately business properties, particularly in the few blocks from The Exchange south. This area is also the lowest part of the street, as it descends from the remains of Bell Hill. This area, now several hundred metres inland from the edge of the Otago Harbour, was the site of the original landing place of settlers from the two ships which brought the Otago Association's settlers to Dunedin. The two ships, the John Wickliffe and the Philip Laing, arrived in early 1848. As they could not negotiate the harbour, they set anchor at the Otago Heads. Settlers from the ships travelled by smaller rowing boat from there to Dunedin. Massive reclamation of the area led to the creation of a wide strip of land, since occupied by commercial premises, warehousing, and the main rail line. The original nature of the site is reflected in the names of Jetty Street and Water Street, both of which cross Princes Street close to the Exchange. This part of Princes Street was at one point the location of a bridge across a small stream, the Toitu Stream, now diverted underground. A spring which fed the stream is still used as the source of water for Speight's Brewery, which is located 200 metres to the northwest on Rattray Street. The Cargill Monument is a prominent feature of John Wickliffe Plaza. Behind it (to the right) is the historic former Bank of New Zealand Building. The former Exchange Building, from which The Exchange takes its name, was an impressive structure, designed by William Mason as a Post Office and later occupied by the University of Otago and the Otago Museum. Next to this was the 1863 Customhouse building, and outside the two was an open space known as Customhouse Square. The Exchange building was pulled down in 1969, and it was largely the destruction of this building that led to changes in attitudes by Dunedinites regarding the change of their cityscape. Since this time, changes to the city's old buildings have been met with vociferous protests. The Customhouse building is also long since gone. Today, the site of the buildings is the location of Dunedin's biggest office block, John Wickliffe House, and the nearby John Wickliffe Plaza. Both are named for the John Wickliffe, the first of the two ships which brought the Otago Association's settlers to Dunedin (a nearby building, Philip Laing House, is named for the other of these two ships). Despite this, the area is the site of several prominent Victorian buildings, notably former bank buildings at the northern end of the area. Other imposing buildings in the area include the Chief Post Office building, the proposed site of a hotel, and - one block to the east - Consultancy House, a seven-storey 1908 building regarded (by dint of its construction methods) as Dunedin's first skyscraper. John Wickliffe Plaza is also the site of one of Dunedin's more notable public monuments, the Cargill Monument, dedicated to city founder Captain William Cargill. This monument, designed by Charles Robert Swyer and built in 1863-4, was originally sited in the Octagon, but was moved to the Exchange in 1872. The Exchange was at one time a complex intersection with two busy streets, Rattray Street and High Street. These lead from the twin streets which make up State Highway 1 at Queen's Gardens (an open park containing the city's main war memorial, Dunedin Cenotaph, close to which lies the Toit≈´ Otago Settlers Museum and the Dunedin Chinese Garden) 200 metres to the east of Princes Street, to the older hill suburbs to the west. Though these streets originally both crossed Princes Street, civic planning has reduced High Street at the intersection to a minor road, and John Wickliffe Plaza now covers part of the original intersection. The area around State Highway 1, extending from the Exchange and Queen's Gardens south towards the Oval, is known as the Warehouse Precinct, and is the site of several major street beautification projects. Apart from the Cargill Monument, the Plaza contains several other items of public sculpture, notably a series of three small brass penguins called \\"We are not alone\\", sculpted by Dan Parry-Jones and unveiled in 1999. A Historic Places Trust blue plaque at the foot of the Cargill Monument marks the location of the first Salvation Army meeting in New Zealand, held at the site in April 1883. =Below the Exchange= Wain's Hotel building, in the Exchange The lower Exchange and area immediately to the south of it contains some other notable buildings, including several of Dunedin's more notable former and current public houses. Among these are Wain's Hotel, the Provincial Hotel (at the foot of Stafford Street), the Empire Tavern, and the former Prince of Wales Hotel. Wain's Hotel, immediately opposite the former Post Office building, is an imposing Italianate structure built in 1878 from designs by Mason and Wales. The Empire Tavern also has a long history, and claims to be Dunedin's oldest pub, having been continuously licensed since 1858. Its recent past is closely tied with the Dunedin sound music scene of the 1980s, of which it was a principal venue. Prior to its gutting by fire in the 1980s, the Prince of Wales Hotel, a block further down Princes Street, was noted for an unusual gimmick, in that the upstairs restaurant facilities were extensively themed on old railway carriages, and included in their decor several original vintage pieces of rolling stock. The Prince of Wales was later (1992‚Äì2010) the location of one of the city's top restaurants, Bell Pepper Blues. Lower Princes Street rises slightly from the Exchange before dropping down, becoming flat for the final kilometre of its length. Here, there is a mix of commercial, wholesale, and light industrial properties, with only occasional retail shops. The street itself widens from thee crest below the Exchange, becoming a dual carriageway from this point south to the major junction at the southern end of the Oval. Several notable buildings are still found in the lower Princes Street area, among them the former H.E. Shacklock building and the Crown Roller Mills Building; the latter in particular is a notable landmark.\\"Heritage Preserved\\", trendsideas.com. Retrieved 3 November 2010 The Crown Roller Mills building is not in Princes Street itself, but rather lies at the foot of Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands at the edge of a small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the opposite edge of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually folded. The bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's playground and, at the edge closes to the Crown Roller Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago workers who have lost their lives while at work. This simple bluestone memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council. Kensington Oval lies at the southern end of Princes Street, effectively separating the central city from South Dunedin. At the bottom end of Princes Street is the former Dunedin Metropolitan Club building, now home to Natural History New Zealand, one of the country's leading television production companies. Opposite this lies a large recreation reserve, which ‚Äî despite its roughly triangular shape ‚Äî is called the Oval, or more correctly, Kensington Oval. Kensington Oval contains mainly cricket and association football pitches, and also caters for rugby, hockey, and softball. Dunedin City Council guide to the Kensington Oval. The Oval also contains one of the city's main war memorials, dedicated to the fallen of the Boer War campaign. This lies close to the Oval's northernmost point. Close to the Oval are two major road junctions. At the north end, a link road connects Princes Street with the city's one-way street system (part of State Highway 1) and with Anderson's Bay Road, a major arterial route to South Dunedin and Otago Peninsula. The part of Princes Street close to the Oval, as well as several other nearby streets, is used annually as part of the Dunedin Street Circuit, a temporary inner city motor- racing circuit used during the week-long Southern Festival of Speed. At the southern end of the Oval is a further junction, with Princes Street terminating in a link road to South Dunedin's main street, King Edward Street, and a further road skirting the edge of a hilly spur to join South Road at the northern end of the suburb of Caversham. This latter road passes Dunedin's Southern Cemetery, the oldest and arguably most historic of the city's main cemeteries. The Southern Cemetery's earliest graves are from 1858, and it contains the remains of many of the city's founding fathers, including Captain William Cargill, Thomas Burns, and Johnny Jones. The cemetery is notable for its large Chinese and Jewish sections. Transport links The top section of Princes Street, from the Octagon to the Exchange, has long been the hub of Dunedin's public transport system. Buses from the north of the city largely pass along George Street and into the Octagon, those from the south pass into the southern end of Princes Street, and those from the hill suburbs arrive at the Octagon via Stuart Street or at the Exchange via High and Rattray Streets. Almost all of these use upper Princes Street between the Exchange and the Octagon as part of their route. In the city's early years trams followed many of these same routes. Until the demise of the system in the 1950s, this area was also at the heart of the Dunedin cable tramway system, with the longer lines running up the slopes of City Rise via High, Rattray, or Stuart Streets.Rice, W. \\"When the endless wire rope stopped in Dunedin, New Zealand, San Francisco was left alone\\", www.cablecarmuseum.org.

Heritage New Zealand listed buildings The Haynes' (Savoy) Building at the corner of Princes Street and Moray Place Few, if any, streets in New Zealand contain as many New Zealand Historic Places Trust Category I or Category II protected buildings as Princes Street. These buildings include the following: *The Haynes' Building, 42-72 Princes St (cnr. Princes St and Moray Place) (Category I). Often now known as the Savoy Building after the restaurant which is its main tenant, this four- storey building was designed by Edmund Anscombe and completed in 1914. The building, with its distinctive cupola, is a major landmark of upper Princes Street, lying one block south of the Octagon. *The Queen's Building, 109 Princes St (Category II). An early, if small, skyscraper, the five-storey Queen's Building was completed in 1929 on the site of the former Queen's Theatre, to a design of J. Louis Salmond. *Excelsior Apartments, 33 Dowling Street (cnr. of Dowling and Princes Sts) (Category II). Standing at the heart of Dunedin's 19th century Central Business District, the Excelsior Apartments are an 1888 structure originally built as a tavern and hotel. The building was designed by Robert Forrest. *The National Bank Building, 193 Princes St (Category I). Designed by William Dunning, an Australian architect, and Charles Fleming MacDonald, this building is reminiscent of many of the grander buildings in Melbourne and Sydney. Constructed in a neo-Baroque style, it uses Tasmanian sandstone and trachyte as a major feature in its fa√ßade, and was completed in 1913. Continuing the history of the building be tenanted by financial institutions, the building was for many years home to MTF, a vehicle finance company. *The Fa√ßade of the old Woolworth's Building, 194 Princes St (Category II).New Zealand Historic Places Trust record New Zealand national anthem. *The Bank of New Zealand Building, 205 Princes St (cnr. Princes and High Sts) (Category I). Designed in Venetian Renaissance styling, the 1882 BNZ building stands just two doors along from the National Bank building. The William Armson-designed building is notable for the richly carved exterior work by Louis Godfrey and moulded ceilings in its interior. The fa√ßade combines Doric, Ionic and Corinthian styles, and makes good use of Port Chalmers bluestone and Oamaru stone, a compact, cream-coloured limestone. *The Southern Cross Hotel, 118 High St (cnr. High and Princes Sts) (Category I). One of Dunedin's principal hotels, the Southern Cross is housed in an impressive 1883 building designed by Louis Boldini. It occupies a prominent corner site in the heart of the Exchange. Formerly the Grand Hotel, the building has been extended considerably on several occasions in its history, and was considerably renovated in the 1980s, though most of its original features remain. The Southern Cross Hotel Building is home to Dunedin Casino. *The Clarion Building, 282-292 Princes St (Category II). This 1878 William Mason building was originally a major drapery store in the heart of what was then Dunedin's retail district. The exterior is of Venetian Gothic style, though the interior has been largely redeveloped in recent years. *The Chief Post Office Building, 283 Princes St (Category II). The Chief Post Office Building has not had an easy history. Designed by John Mair and the Governments Architects Office, construction was severely delayed by the Great Depression. Originally intended to be built in the early 1930s, it was not completed until 1937. A sturdy and impressive structure, possibly modelled on some of the government architecture in vogue in the United Kingdom during this era, the building held Dunedin's main post office branch until the late 1980s. Since this time it has lain largely empty; many plans had been put forward for its use, including a hotel, a new site for the city's public library, and offices for either the Dunedin City Council or Otago Regional Council. In 2013, an extensive renovation of the lower few floors began, with Silver Fern Farms moving in on the ground and first floors as anchor tenant in February 2014. Subsequently, other tenancies have been taken up by a gym and dance studio, and long-term executive and hotel accommodation is planned for the remaining floors. The Dowling Street steps *Wain's Hotel, 310 Princes St (Category I). Built in 1879 to a design by Mason & Wales, Wain's Hotel remains Dunedin's grandest hotel building, and reflects the opulence which followed the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s. The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance fa√ßade remains largely intact. This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled spandrels and supporting the fa√ßade's oriel windows. *The ANZ Bank Building, Dunedin, 319 Princes St (Category II). Robert Lawson's 1874 Union Bank of Australasia building is the only classical temple form structure in Dunedin. It is a partner to the architect's work on bank buildings in Oamaru, and features carved Corinthian columns by Godfrey. The building continued to be used as a bank until 1992, and now houses a night club. *The H.E. Shacklock Building, 595-625 Princes St (Category II). The only listed manufacturing building in Princes Street, the Shacklock building covers a large site at the southern end of Princes Street opposite the Market Reserve.New Zealand Historic Places Trust record The Cargill Monument at John Wickliffe Plaza is also listed (Category I), as are numerous buildings and structures which lie close to the intersection of side roads with Princes Street (e.g., the Category I Crown Roller Mills Building in Manor Place and the Category II Dowling Street Steps).New Zealand Historic Places Trust record See also *Colombo Street, Christchurch *History of Dunedin *Lambton Quay, Wellington *List of historic places in Dunedin *Princes Street, Edinburgh *Queen Street, Auckland Notes References Hayward, P.

It is a larger version of the BTR-80 vehicle, fitted with a BMP-2 turret. Armour protection is improved compared with the BTR-80, giving protection from 14.5 mm projectiles over the frontal arc. It is armed with a 2A42 30 mm auto cannon, a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun, an AT-5 Spandrel ATGM, as well as an AGS-17D 30 mm automatic grenade launcher. Limited numbers have been produced and are in service with Russian Internal Troops. In October 2011, the Ministry of Defence refused to buy the BTR-90 and did not include them in the list of the state program of armament until 2020, and waived exports for the BTR-90. Development The development of the BTR-90 was carried out at the Arzamas Machine Building Plant (AMZ), a subsidiary of the Military Industrial Company. Development commenced in the early 1990s, with the first prototype completed and displayed to the public in 1994. The vehicle was intended to be used by mechanized units of the Russian Army, as well as marine units of the Russian Navy, as a vehicle for providing fire support, transportation of personnel, surveillance, reconnaissance, and patrolling tasks. A wide range of vehicles suiting various requirements can be developed on the basis of the BTR-90 chassis. The vehicle is designed to be highly mobile and maneuverable in all terrain, while providing a high level of protection for its crew and passengers. The BTR-90 is fitted with a gun turret identical to the one used on the BMP-2. Description The BTR-90 has a pointed nose, somewhat similar to that of the LAV-25. The hull is made of welded steel armour plate, and is slightly larger and higher than the BTR-80, from which it is developed. A turbo charged, liquid cooled, multi-fuel diesel engine is used, which can develop 510 bhp. The vehicle has eight-wheel drive and has an automatic reversible hydro mechanical transmission, which is capable of providing different speeds to each side of the vehicle. Duplicated electrical and compressed air engine start systems are also used. The wheels are utilized with independent torsion-bar suspension and the traverse arms have high capacity telescopic hydraulic shock absorbers. Communication equipment installed in the BTR-90 include an R-163-50U radio set for external communications, an R-163UP receiver, and an R-174 intercom device for communication between the crew members. =Layout= The layout and positioning of equipment and parts in the BTR-90 is similar to those of the BTR-80 and BTR-80A. The commander and gunner are accommodated in a fighting compartment in the turret. This compartment also houses a BPK-3-42 gunner's day/night sight and a 1P-13 commander's optical sight. Optionally, a BPK-M thermal imaging sight can be fitted in this compartment as the gunner's sight. The driver is located somewhat to the middle of the hull, just in front of the turret. The troop compartment is located behind the driver's position and the turret. The engine compartment is at the rear of the hull. Hatches are provided on the top of the turret and hull, and side doors are available on the middle of the vehicle. These are designed to allow quick dismounting and boarding of troops even while the vehicle is on the move. The eight wheels are located as two sets, with two pairs at the front of the hull and two pairs at the rear. Split side doors are located between these two sets of wheels. The two forward pairs of wheels are utilized with power steering. =Capabilities and features= The BTR-90 is capable of achieving a maximum speed of 100 km/h, and has cross-country driving ability comparable to that of tracked vehicles, with an average speed of 50 km/h. The vehicle is fully amphibious and can negotiate water obstacles without any preparation. Two water jet propellers power the vehicle in water, and it can achieve a maximum speed of 9 km/h. It can enter and be deployed from amphibious assault ships from the water. The BTR-90 can be deployed by truck, rail and also by water and air transportation means. Its hydro mechanical transmission helps to increase its maneuverability by providing different speeds to each side of the vehicle. This allows the BTR-90 to have a low turning radius of 6 m. When turning with only the front four wheels, it has a turning radius of 14 m. It can cross up to 2.1 m wide trenches and can negotiate 60% gradients, 30% side slopes and 0.8 m vertical steps. The vehicle has an inner capacity of 12 cubic meters, and can carry a load of 7,000 kg. An air conditioning system can be added optionally. The commander has the ability to carry out all-round surveillance and can take full control of the weapons from the gunner. An onboard information control system (OICS) enables automatic control over the transmission, engine and other important parts of the BTR-90, and it is the first armoured personnel carrier to have such a system. A centralized tire pressure control system is also available, and allows the vehicle to move even if four of its wheels are destroyed. =Armour and protection= The armour of the BTR-90 comprises welded steel armour plates. The armour can withstand hits from 14.5 mm rounds over the frontal arc. The side armour can provide protection against large caliber machine gun fire and shrapnel. Additional armoured plates can be installed on the vehicle to increase protection. Active protection methods can also be used, such as explosive reactive armour. These can be added over the existing armour of the vehicle. To increase protection, periscopes are installed instead of windscreens and vision blocks. Collective NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) protection is available which can protect the occupants from shock waves and penetrating radiation from nuclear attacks, radioactive dust, and bacteriological and chemical weapons. Its combat tires are capable of enduring anti-personnel mine explosions and small arms fire. If the vehicle is damaged while afloat, a drainage system is capable of removing incoming water. The BTR-90 also features an automatic fire fighting system, and a system for remote laying of smoke screens. The smoke discharge system includes six smoke grenade launchers, three on each side of the vehicle. =Armament= The main gun of the BTR-90 is a 30 mm Shipunov 2A42 auto cannon. The vehicle carries an ammunition load of 500 rounds for this weapon. A 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun with 2,000 rounds and a 30 mm AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher are the secondary armaments of the BTR-90. A guided missile system is also available for engaging armoured targets. This consists of four 9M113 Konkurs missiles mounted on the turret. The launching unit is detachable, and can be used to launch missiles from the ground. All the weapons are mounted on the turret and are assisted by a fire control system. The fire control system allows the weapons to be used while the vehicle is moving, and in all weather conditions. The turret can be traversed 360 degrees with an elevation range of ‚àí5 to +75 degrees. The vehicle's weaponry allows it to engage targets at ranges up to 4 km. Helicopters and fortifications can be engaged at ranges up to 2.5 km. In addition to the vehicle's weapons, its occupants have the ability to fire their weapons through available firing ports and hatches, increasing its firepower. Variants A prototype designated BTR-90M was built (see photo) with a larger turret derived from the BMP-3, mounting a coaxial low-velocity 2A70 100mm rifled gun/missile launcher system (which can fire conventional shells or laser beam-riding 9M117 anti-tank missiles (ATGM), such as AT-10 Stabber), a 30mm Shipunov 2A72 cannon, and a 7.62mm PKT machine gun. The BTR-90M was first displayed publicly in 2001, and is not currently in service. Another variant of the BTR-90 was produced with the low pressure 120 mm 2S9 Nona weapon, as with the BTR-80 Nona-SVK. =Krymsk= On 30 July 2013, Russia revealed that it had developed and tested a hybrid-powered silent armored personnel carrier that could be turned into an unmanned ground vehicle. Called the Krymsk, it is based on the BTR-90 and can move silently on a battery- driven electric motor when its diesel engine is turned off. Currently, it can only move short distances on electric power, but new types of batteries can increase the distances by \\"dozens of times\\". During tests, the Krymsk moved at a maximum speed of 97 km/h (60 mph), accelerating to 80 km/h in 33 seconds. The Krymsk is a remotely controlled platform and can be equipped with weapon systems, including future laser or electromagnetic weapons.Russia Develops Silent Robotic Armored Vehicle - Rian.ru, 30 July 2013 Gallery File:TB2015ExhibitionP1-20.jpgBTR-90 front File:BTR-90 (1).jpgBTR-90 right front File:BTR-90 (9).jpgBTR-90 top forward from turret File:TB2015ExhibitionP1-24.jpgBTR-90 right rear References External links * manufacturer site * BTR-90 Description and pictures to Army Recognition site * FAS page Category:Armoured personnel carriers of Russia Category:GAZ Group military vehicles Category:Amphibious armoured personnel carriers Category:Armoured personnel carriers of the post‚ÄìCold War period Category:Wheeled amphibious armoured fighting vehicles ","title":"BTR-90"},{"id":"3664638","title":"Jeremy Stevenson"},{"id":"3664651","text":"Lawrence Clarke (June 26, 1832 - October 5, 1890, Prince Albert, Northwest Territories) was the Chief Factor of the Saskatchewan District of the Hudson's Bay Company. He resided at Fort Carlton in Canada. He later became a magistrate. Clarke moved to what is today Prince Albert, Saskatchewan in the early 1880s and was a prominent local citizen with connections in the Conservative Party of Canada. He is regarded by some as worsening the living conditions for the M√©tis.. He questioned Gabriel Dumont for fining a group of M√©tis who had begun to hunt bison before the official hunt of the St. Laurent community in the spring of 1875, but after investigation, the Crown carried no action against Dumont or the St. Laurent group. However, after this interaction the concern the government had over the St. Laurent settlement being seen as a 'provisional' government as with Riel in 1869‚Äì70, saw the St Laurent group become less organized in their political structure to prevent tensions with the crown.Father Alexandre Andr√©, \\"Petite Chronique de St. Laurent,\\" 1894 1871, Oblates Archives, Provincial Archives of Alberta. Constance Kerr Sissons, John Kerr (Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1946). Some figures in the M√©tis community, notably James Isbister, also blamed him for inciting the M√©tis to violence in 1885 by spreading false rumours of an impending government attack. Thomas McKay, first mayor of Prince Albert was Clarke's brother-in-law. He was the first elected Member of the Legislative Assembly in Northwest Territories' history.

A pupil of the composers Schoenberg and Webern, he conducted at opera houses in Austria, Germany and Czechoslovakia until fleeing from the Nazis and taking refuge in England in 1939. Rankl was appointed musical director of the newly formed Covent Garden Opera Company in 1946, and built it up from nothing to a level where it attracted some of the best known international opera singers as guest stars. By 1951, performances under guest conductors, such as Erich Kleiber and Sir Thomas Beecham were overshadowing Rankl's work, and he resigned. After five years as conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra, he was appointed musical director of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust's opera company, the forerunner of Opera Australia. In his last years, Rankl concentrated on composing. Throughout his career he had written a series of symphonies and other works, including an opera. His symphonies were politely received, but did not enter the regular orchestral repertoire. The opera has never been performed.  Life and career  =Early years= Rankl was born in Gaaden, near Vienna, the fourteenth child of a peasant couple.Obituary, The Times, 7 September 1968, p. 10 He was educated in Vienna, and from 1918 studied composition there with Arnold Schoenberg and later with Anton Webern. With fellow students Hans Eisler and Erwin Stein Rankl arranged Bruckner's Symphony No 7 for Schoenberg's Society for Private Musical Performances in 1921 - but the society closed down before it could be performed.Jackson, T, and Hawkshaw, P. Bruckner Studies (1997), p 206 Many years later, Rankl was invited by the composer to complete Schoenberg's oratorio Die Jakobsleiter but he declined the invitation.Heyworth, Peter. \\"The Fragments of a Giant\\", The Observer, 25 June 1961, p. 23The Times obituarist identified the unfinished Schoenberg piece in question as the opera Moses und Aron. Rankl's first professional post was as chorus master and r√©p√©titeur under Felix Weingartner at the Volksoper in Vienna in 1919, where he later became an assistant conductor.Tolansky, Jon. \\"Karl Rankl,\\" The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 April 2011 In 1923 he married Adele Jahoda (1903‚Äì1963). Over the next few years he held appointments in Liberec in 1925, K√∂nigsberg in 1927 and the Kroll Oper in Berlin where he was assistant to Otto Klemperer from 1928 to 1931.Howes, Frank. \\"Rankl, Karl,\\"Grove Music Online Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 April 2011 At the Kroll, Rankl strongly supported Klemperer's policy of promoting new music and radical productions. He was appointed principal conductor of the opera at Wiesbaden in 1931, but when the Nazis came to power in 1933, he had to leave Germany; his wife was Jewish, and Rankl's politics were strongly hostile to the Nazis.Haltrecht, p. 80 He moved back to Austria to head the opera at Graz in 1933, and in 1937 he was appointed principal conductor of the Neues Deutsches Theater in Prague. In 1939, once again displaced by the Nazis, Rankl fled Prague, and with the help of Sir Adrian Boult, head of music at the BBC, and Boult's assistant Kenneth Wright, he escaped to London.\\"Austrian Conductor ‚Äì A.B.C. Engagement\\", The West Australian, 18 October 1945 p. 3 In wartime Britain Rankl was unable to obtain a permit to work as a conductor until 1944, and he devoted much of his time to composition.Harewood, p. 68 His widow later recalled that Rankl also played the viola in a string quartet during this period.Conway, Paul. \\"Karl Rankl (1898‚Äì1968)\\", Music Web International, accessed 3 April 2011 When he was eventually given the necessary work permit to resume his conducting career, Rankl conducted the Liverpool Philharmonic, BBC NorthernGlock, William, \\"Music\\", The Observer, 21 January 1945, p. 2 and London Philharmonic Orchestras.\\"The Coliseum Concerts\\", The Times, 6 April 1945, p. 6 He made a favourable impression; The Times praised his \\"boundless energy ‚Ä¶ clear-cut performance and with a strong feeling for the shapely line of a melody.\\" William Glock in The Observer praised the \\"natural firmness\\" of his \\"splendid\\" and \\"authoritative\\" conducting of Beethoven. Among those whom Rankl impressed was David Webster, chairman of the Liverpool Philharmonic. In 1944, Webster was invited to set up a new opera company at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London. He turned to Rankl for advice and soon decided to appoint him musical director of the fledgling company. =Covent Garden= Since 1939 there had been no opera or ballet at the Royal Opera House. Until the war, Covent Garden opera had consisted of privately sponsored seasons, principally in the summer months, with international stars, lavish productions, and a major symphony orchestra brought in to play in the orchestra pit.Haltrecht, pp. 51‚Äì52 In 1944, the British government introduced a modest measure of state subsidy for the arts, and as part of this it established a Covent Garden Trust to present opera and ballet at the Royal Opera House. Webster successfully negotiated with Ninette de Valois to get her Sadler's Wells Ballet company to move its base to Covent Garden, but he had to build up an opera company from scratch.Haltrecht pp. 60 and 67‚Äì79 He initially approached famous conductors including Bruno Walter and Eugene Goossens, but found them unwilling to accommodate themselves to the new brief of the Covent Garden opera company: to present opera in English, with a permanent company, all year round on a very tight budget. Rankl was on the verge of going to Australia in response to an invitation from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to conduct a 13-week season of 20 concerts.\\"A.B.C. Concerts ‚Äì Change Announced\\", The West Australian 11 March 1946, p. 6 He and the corporation were unable to agree terms, and in April 1946, he accepted the Covent Garden post. His appointment immediately caused controversy in musical circles. To those who hankered after the glamour of the pre-war seasons he was a minor figure among international maestros.Haltrecht, p. 79 Among those outraged by Rankl's appointment was Sir Thomas Beecham, who had been in control of Covent Garden for much of the period from 1910 to 1939, and was furious at being excluded under the new regime. He publicly stated that the appointment of an alien, especially one bearing a German name was the \\"mystery of mysteries\\", and called the Covent Garden trustees a \\"hapless set of ignoramuses and nitwits\\".\\"Sir T. Beecham Hits at Opera Plan\\", The Mercury, 7 January 1949, p. 3 Webster, however, realised that what the new Covent Garden company needed at this stage in its existence was not a star conductor but one of those who, in the words of the critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor \\"know the whole complex business of opera inside out, and retain in their blood the pre-war standards of a good continental opera house.\\"Haltrecht, p. 81 A biographer of Webster has written that under Rankl, \\"amazing progress\\" was made. He assembled and trained an orchestra and a chorus. He recruited and trained musical assistants.Haltrecht pp.81‚Äì82 Having recruited and trained a largely British company of singers, Rankl, with Webster's strong support, persuaded international singers including Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Ljuba Welitsch, Hans Hotter and Paolo Silveri to appear with the company, singing in English. The company performed a wide repertory of German, Italian, Russian and English opera. It made its debut in January 1947 with Carmen, in a performance greeted by The Times as \\"worthy of the stage on which it appeared ... It revealed in Mr. Karl Rankl a musical director who knew how to conduct opera.\\"\\"The Royal Opera\\", The Times, 15 January 1947, p. 6 The company, headed by Edith Coates and including Dennis Noble, Grahame Clifford, David Franklin and Constance Shacklock, was warmly praised. In the next two operas presented by the company, Rankl was thought a little stolid in The Magic Flute, but was praised for \\"weaving Strauss's flexible rhythms\\" in Der Rosenkavalier.\\"Covent Garden Opera\\", The Times, 21 March 1947, p. 6, and 23 April 1947, p/ 7 Rankl tackled the Italian repertoire, and new English works, winning praise for his Rigoletto, though with Peter Grimes he was compared to his disadvantage with the original conductor, Reginald Goodall.\\"The Royal Opera\\", The Times, 1 November 1947, p. 6, and \\"Covent Garden Opera\\", The Times, 29 November 1947, p. 6 A production of The Masteringers with Hotter as Sachs was judged \\"a further stage in the consolidation of the Covent Garden company\\".\\"Covent Garden\\", The Times, 22 January 1948, p. 6 Despite the good notices for his early seasons, Rankl had to cope with a vociferous public campaign by Beecham against the very idea of establishing a company of British artists; Beecham maintained that the British could not sing opera, and had produced only half a dozen first rate operatic artists in the past 60 years.\\"Opera Trust Criticized. Sir T. Beecham Calls for Inquiry\\", The Times, 6 January 1949, p. 2 In the next three years, Rankl built the company up, reluctantly casting foreign stars when no suitable British singer could be found, and resisting attempts by Webster to invite eminent guest conductors.Haltrecht, p. 133 When Webster and the Covent Garden board insisted, Rankl took it badly that star conductors such as Erich Kleiber, Clemens Krauss and Beecham were brought into \\"his\\" opera house.Haltrecht, pp. 145 and 150 In a biographical article in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the critic Frank Howes wrote of Rankl: \\"By 1951 he had made the Covent Garden Company a going concern, but had also revealed, notably in his 1950 performances of the Ring, his limitations as a conductor ‚Äì he was considered difficult with singers, orchestras and producers.\\" Rankl was also difficult in his relations with the Opera House's director of productions, Peter Brook, who left after two years.Haltrecht, pp. 137‚Äì138 Critics and operagoers did not fail to notice the difference in standards between performances under Rankl and under the guests.Haltrecht, p. 146 Rankl resigned in May 1951, and conducted for the last time at the Royal Opera House on 30 June. The work was Tristan und Isolde with Kirsten Flagstad; as it was announced in advance that this would be her last appearance in the role of IsoldeIn fact Flagstad sang her last Isolde, with the Covent Garden company on tour in Liverpool the following month with Rankl conducting. See \\"Mme Flagstad's last Isolde\\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 July 1951, p. 5 and her farewell performance at Covent Garden, the fact that it was also Rankl's farewell received little attention.Haltrecht, p. 150 He was never invited to conduct there again, and did not set foot in the building for another 14 years, until 1965 for the first night of Moses und Aron by his old teacher, Schoenberg; the conductor then was Georg Solti. After the end of the 1951 London season, Rankl conducted the Covent Garden company on tour; his final performance with the company was Der Rosenkavalier in Liverpool on 27 July 1951.\\"Mme Flagstad's last Isolde\\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 July 1951, p. 5 =Later years= In 1952, Rankl was appointed conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra, in succession to Walter Susskind.\\"Conductorship for Dr Karl Rankl\\", The Manchester Guardian, 6 June 1952, p. 5 He held the post for five years, and gained good notices. In 1953, Neville Cardus wrote that Rankl and his orchestra held their own even when compared against Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and the Vienna Philharmonic, when both orchestras played at that year's Edinburgh Festival.Cardus, Neville. \\"A great conductor\\", The Manchester Guardian, 9 September 1953, p. 4 Rankl was praised for enterprising programming, presenting the then-unknown early work of Schoenberg Gurrelieder at the 1954 Edinburgh Festival,\\"Schoenberg's 'Gurrelieder',\\" The Manchester Guardian, 27 August 1954, p. 5 and Mahler's Fifth Symphony, also then a rarity, at the same festival.Cardus, Neville. \\"Berlioz and Mahler at Edinburgh\\", The Manchester Guardian, 9 September 1954, p. 5 Cardus also praised Rankl's conducting of Bruckner as \\"grand and comprehensive ‚Ä¶ of rare quality\\".Cardus, Neville. \\"Edinburgh Festival\\", The Manchester Guardian, 4 September 1956, p. 5 In December 1957, Rankl was appointed musical director of the Elizabethan Trust Opera Company in Australia.\\"Dr Karl Rankl's new appointment\\", The Times, 12 December 1957, p. 3 In his first season, he conducted Carmen, Peter Grimes, Fidelio, Lohengrin and The Barber of Seville.\\"Musician's wife loves life\\", The Australian Women's Weekly, 4 June 1958, p. 29 He conducted the company at the inaugural Adelaide Festival in 1960, in Richard Strauss's Salome and Puccini's Il trittico.\\"Adelaide's first festival\\", The Guardian, 22 October 1959, p. 8 Towards the end of his life, Rankl retired to St. Gilgen, near Salzburg in Austria. He died there at the age of 69.\\"Dr. Karl Rankl\\", The Guardian, 7 September 1968, p. 2  Compositions and recordings  As a composer, Rankl wrote eight symphonies (1938, 1941, 1944, 1953, 1954, 1961, 1962, 1963), a string quartet, and 60 songs.

The corporate headquarters are in Kansas City, Missouri. In July 2014 the company was acquired by the Swiss company Lindt & Spr√ºngli.  History  =Eskimo Pie years= Russell Stover Candies did not start with candy. In 1921, Russell Stover and his partner at the time, Iowa schoolteacher Christian Kent Nelson, created the world's first chocolate-dipped ice cream bar. At a dinner party, Russell's wife Clara Stover suggested calling it an Eskimo Pie. The product was a success for them, making them quite a fortune in their first year. = Chocolate candies = However, as other companies soon began to release similar chocolate-dipped ice cream products, Russell Stover was nearly forced out of business. The Stovers sold their share of the company for $25,000 and moved to Denver, Colorado. In 1923, Russell and Clara created the new eponymous company from their home, packaging and selling boxed chocolates. They were originally named \\"Mrs. Stover's Bungalow Candies\\". However, 20 years later, in 1943, it was renamed Russell Stover Candies. = Expansion = The company remained in the Stover family until 1969 when it was purchased by Louis Ward, who transformed the Midwest regional brand into a world-wide brand. The company expanded its chocolate brands by acquiring Whitman's in 1993 and Pangburn's in 1999. It was owned by the Ward family until July 14, 2014, when the Swiss chocolate maker Lindt bought Russell Stover Candies. Russell Stover Candies is the nation‚Äôs leading manufacturer of boxed chocolates and the third largest American chocolate manufacturer, trailing only Hershey and Mars. The company‚Äôs three brands ‚Äì Russell Stover, Whitman's, and Pangburn's ‚Äì account for more than 60 percent of all boxed chocolate sales in the United States. Russell Stover candies are sold in nearly 40 company- owned retail stores and through 70,000 wholesale accounts in more than 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company manufactures around 45,000 metric tons of chocolate annually.

Panmure Station received a major upgrade and became a significant bus-rail interchange, as part of the AMETI project, during the 2012‚Äì2014 period. History The original station was constructed, along with five others, in 1929 on the route of the Westfield Deviation, which was being built to divert the Auckland‚ÄìWestfield section of the North Island Main Trunk line (NIMT) via a flatter, faster eastern route to link up with the original NIMT tracks at Westfield Junction. The deviation was opened for traffic on 11 May 1930. Panmure Station opened on 16 November 1930,Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand and was situated about 100m west of Ireland Road. A small station building was located in the middle of the station's island platform. At the time of opening, the area surrounding the station was predominantly rural. Access to the station was originally provided by two pedestrian bridges. A ramp from the northern end of the platform led to a bridge between Ireland Road and the western side of the station, from where a path provided access to the Ellerslie-Panmure Highway. From the southern end of the platform, a bridge provided access from the platform to a path which led to the Mount Wellington Highway. By the end of the 1950s the area surrounding the station had become substantially more developed. Ireland Place had become a residential street, and there was a mix of residential and light industrial development on Mount Wellington Highway. Several side-streets had been built between Mount Wellington Highway and the railway. Access from the northern bridge to Ireland Road had been removed, and ramps were added from the southern bridge to William Harvey Place (off Mount Wellington Highway) and Ireland Road. By the turn of the century, Panmure had grown substantially. The condition of the station, however, had deteriorated. The original station building had been replaced by a much smaller one, the northern footbridge had been removed, and the platform itself had begun to deteriorate. In addition, patronage was low (recorded as 83 boardings per day in 2003) and the station was not located close to the town centre. It was therefore decided to close the original Panmure Station and open a new station between Ellerslie-Panmure Highway and Mountain Road. The new station would be more modern, be closer to the town centre, and provide better connections with bus services. The station was opened in the first half of 2007. It has two side platforms, located below road level. Access is from Ellerslie-Panmure Highway, Mountain Road, and the carpark. A park and ride facility is located adjacent to the eastbound platform. The station's relocation had a significant effect on patronage with recorded daily boardings climbing from 268 in 2006 to 446 in 2007. In 2018, the station was the fifth busiest in Auckland, with 3,700 passenger boardings daily. Bus-train interchange In October 2011, work began on the AMETI project, with the replacement of the Mountain Road bridge, immediately north of the station. AMETI is a $1.5-billion initiative designed to reduce congestion and improve public transport in Auckland's eastern suburbs. In May 2012, construction of a pedestrian plaza over part of the platforms and an adjacent bus station with dedicated bus lanes began. The plaza and bus station were opened in January 2014. The new plaza provides access from the carpark and bus stop to both platforms via escalators and stairs.

Australian architectural styles, like the revivalist trends which dominated Europe for centuries, have been primarily derivative. Background Europeans‚Äô early contacts with Indigenous populations led them to misinterpret Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' ways of life. Until the 20th century, a fallacy existed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples lacked permanent buildings and their own forms of architecture. Labelling Aboriginal communities as 'nomadic' allowed early settlers to justify the takeover of traditional lands claiming that they were not inhabited by permanent residents. A large body of evidence now indicates that a broad range of Indigenous traditional architecture forms (known as ethoarchitecture) and sophisticated knowledge of construction existed. During the nineteenth century, Australian architects were inspired by developments in England. This is in part due to a large number of architects coming from England to Australia to practice. In the twentieth century, American and International influences dominated. As Australia gradually became a multicultural nation in the late 20th century, the influences of immigrants also became evident. Imported exotic styles earlier than this can be found in a small number of historically significant Joss houses and synagogues. In more recent times, other global and South-East Asian influences have had a minor influence on Australian architectural styles. Some architectural styles show the direct influence of local factors such as climate (directly resulting in the \\"Filigree\\", \\"Queenslander\\" and \\"Federation Home\\" styles) and local materials and skillsets. Some Australian architects were also seen at the forefront of various movements, particularly residential architects like Harry Norris, Roy Grounds, Robin Boyd, Frederick Romberg and Harry Seidler. Categories of styles Australian Architectural Styles can be divided into two main categories: \\"Residential\\" and \\"Non-Residential\\".

The weight from the Volcanic Island chain depresses the plastic Lithosphere that is already weakened by the underlying thermal hotspot, causing subsidence to occur. The location with the greatest rate of subsidence is directly above the hotspot with a rate of about 2.5 millimeters per year. The Hawaiian Trough is about 5500 meters deep and has a radius of about 14 km.Rees, B. A., Detrick, R. S., & Coakley, B. J. (1993). Seismic stratigraphy of the Hawaiian flexural moat. Geologic Society of America Bulletin, 105, 189‚Äì205. The subsiding lithosphere is balanced out and through the concept of isostasy a part of the crust surrounding the trough is levered upwards creating the Hawaiian Arch. The Hawaiian Arch extends about 200 meters above the surrounding ocean floor, and contains tilted coral reefs.  Trough Development  The Hawaiian Trough is filled with a stratified sedimentary section >2 km thick that was deposited in 4 sequential stages. The first (bottom) stage is a basal layer composed of 50 ‚Äì100 m of primarily pelagic sediment. This layer was slowly deposited on the 80-Ma oceanic crust before the depression formed. The sediment in this layer is from a variety of different sources including wind blown material, slowly setting fine-grained sediment, and biogenic debris. The second stage is characterized by a bedded layer of volcanoclastic material that fills the Trough as it quickly subsides due to large influxes of material from nearby volcanos. The majority of material in this layer was transported by turbidity currents that flow along the axis of the moat and transport material from mass wasting events. During the third stage, the depression fills with slumps and debris avalanches which creates a layer of landslide debris. This layer contributes to the bulk of the sediment in the Trough. In the fourth and final stage, volcanic activity and subsistence effectively ends, and sediment deposits brought my turbidity currents, create a ponded unit in the deepest part of the Trough. This top layer is primary composed of turbidite and pelagic sediments. The largest mass wasting events, such as the Nuuanu-Wailau debris avalanches and the Hana slump, overfilled the moat and created a series of sub-basins. These large deposits block the lateral transport of sediment along the Trough, especially in the deepest sections. Storm surges and internal waves trigger mass wasting events from older volcanos on the western side of the ridge, earthquakes provoke this behavior from younger volcanos on the eastern side[1].  Coral Reefs  The coral reefs in the Hawaiian Tough are described as mesophotic coral ecosystems, which can be found between 100 and 500 feet below sea level. 43 percent of fish species documented at the mesophotic reefs are unique to the Hawaiian Islands. At Maui's ‚ÄòAu‚Äôau channel the largest uninterrupted mesophotic coral ecosystem was discovered, with an area larger than 3 square miles. These reefs contained many stony, reef building coral that belong to the genus Leptoseris, which are adapted for deep water environments. These coral environments are not greatly understood because the great depth where they exist make exploration difficult.

It contains questions from many fields of mathematics; about 50% of the questions come from calculus (including pre-calculus topics, multivariate calculus, and differential equations), 25% come from algebra (including linear algebra, abstract algebra, and number theory), and 25% come from a broad variety of other topics typically encountered in undergraduate mathematics courses, such as point-set topology, probability and statistics, geometry, and real analysis. Similar to all the GRE subject tests, the GRE Mathematics test is paper-based, as opposed to the GRE general test which is usually computer-based. It contains approximately 66 multiple-choice questions, which are to be answered within 2 hours and 50 minutes. Scores on this exam are required for entrance to most math Ph.D. programs in the United States. Scores are scaled and then reported as a number between 200 and 990; however, in recent versions of the test, the maximum and minimum reported scores have been 920 and 400, which correspond to the 99th percentile and the 1st percentile, respectively. The mean score for all test takers from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2014 was 659, with a standard deviation of 137. Prior to October 2001, a significant percentage of students were achieving perfect scores on the exam, which made it difficult for competitive programs to differentiate between students in the upper percentiles.

Once a separate city, it merged when Iloilo City was re-incorporated in the 1940s during the American administration in the Philippines. Jaro is the largest of all the seven districts comprising the City of Iloilo. The Iloilo City district of La Paz and the present municipalities of Leganes and Pavia, adjoined as historical parts of Jaro before they became independent. Jaro lends its name to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro, the metropolitan see which covers the provinces of Antique, Guimaras, Iloilo, and Negros Occidental. The Jaro annual Catholic feast of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Candelaria (Our Lady of the Candles), the Roman Catholic patron of the whole Western Visayas and Romblon, held every February 2, is one of the well known marian festivals in the Philippines. The statue or image of Candelaria (Our Lady of the Candles) perched atop the facade of the cathedral, is the first marian image crowned personally without a papal legate by a Pope and Saint in the Philippines and in Asia, by Pope John Paul II in 1981.Jaro Fiesta centers on the life of youth. Retrieved 05/03/2019.JARO FIESTA SCENES. Retrieved 05/03/2019. The town of Jaro is known being the Mestizo Town of Iloilo, due to prominent Spanish Filipino and old-rich affluent Ilonggo families who came from the area. It is also dubbed as \\"One of the cradles of Christian faiths in the Philippines\\", \\"Seat of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism in Western Visayas\\" because of the pioneer religious institutions it has established by the Spanish Catholics and American Protestants. Jaro's known religious importance in Western Visayas and the country derives from the town being the cradle of Christian faiths - with Roman Catholic and Protestant institutions established and founded in the area. The Spanish Catholics established institutions like the Seminario de San Vicente Ferrer, Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles) and the Archdiocese of Jaro, one of the oldest and largest Archdioceses in the Philippines. With the coming of the American Protestants in the early 20th century, there came the establishment of Central Philippine University (the first Baptist and second American University in Asia), CPU‚ÄìIloilo Mission Hospital (the first American and Protestant hospital in the Philippines), the Jaro Evangelical Church (the first Baptist Church in the Philippines and the first Protestant church outside Manila); Jaro Adventist Center (the first Adventist Church in the country); and the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines). The recent 21st century economic boom in Iloilo City which poured in investments especially in the real estate and retail sector benefitted Jaro resulting in the rise of various establishments and townships sprouting in the district's area. History Preparations for the arrival of Governor General William H. Taft, 1900s Its original name was Salog or Saro. It was also referred to as \\"Ilaya\\" or \\"mountain/dry land\\" together with La Paz which was referred to as \\"Ilawod\\" or \\"sea/wet land\\".History of Panay, Felix B. Regalado, Quintin B. Franco, Central Philippine University, 1973 It had been one of the richer areas of Iloilo City even during the Spanish colonial period (1521-1898) and probably the richest town of the entire colony. Historical artifacts indicate that it had once conducted trade with China and Siam (Thailand) due to its port along the navigable river that ran through the town. It was also the center of religious and economic power in the Visayas during the Spanish rule. Jaro officially became a city in 1886. La Paz, which was a former part of Jaro, became independent. Jaro, along with the neighboring towns of La Paz, Mandurriao, and Molo, was incorporated into the then-municipality of Iloilo by virtue of Act No. 719 of 1903. By Executive Order No. 64 of December 24, 1907, the former municipalities of Jaro and Pavia (which was incorporated into Iloilo municipality by virtue of Act No. 1333 of April 19, 1905) were separated from the municipality of Iloilo and constituted as its own municipality of Jaro with effect on February 15, 1908.Executive Order No. 64 of December 24, 1907, see By Executive Order No. 1 of 1921, Pavia was separated from Jaro and made its own municipality.Executive Order No. 1 of 1921, see By Executive Order No. 97 of December 6, 1915, Leganes was removed from the municipality of Santa Barbara and made a part of Jaro with effect on January 1, 1916.Executive Order No. 97 of December 6, 1915, see Leganes was separated from the municipality of Jaro and made its own municipality with effect on January 1, 1940, by virtue of Executive Order No. 241 of December 23, 1939.

The present independent Iloilo municipalities of Leganes and Pavia were also formerly under the jurisdiction of Jaro at some points in their history. Jaro's location between Dungon Creek and the Tigum River fulfills an ideal design for establishing communities during the Spanish colonial era: a site between two rivers, with a church and plaza in the center, and homes of affluent families in the vicinity. The church is the famous Parish of Our Lady of Candles, also known as the Jaro Metropolitan Cathedral, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro and the site of a believed to be miraculous statue of the Virgin Mary, which is a statue that has supposedly been growing in size ever since its discovery. Legends also state that among misty days, the Virgin Mary had disappeared from its original nook near the apex of the cathedral and bathed her child in the stream that used to well-forth from Jaro Plaza or that in Moro incursions, the Virgin had assisted in frightening off the raiders. The Marian image perched atop the facade of the cathedral was canonically crowned by Pope John Paul II during his visit on 21 February 1981 (the first Marian image or statue in the Philippines crowned by a Pope and Saint).

The coming of the Americans in the early 20th century when the Philippines was ceded by Spain to the United States through the 1898 Treaty of Paris brought with them the Protestant religion and Iloilo is one of the first places where they came and started a mission in the Philippines. During the American occupation, the Philippine islands were divided into different Protestant missions and Western Visayas came to the jurisdiction of the Baptists. Baptist missionaries came although other Protestant sects came also especially the Presbyterians and they established numerous institutions. The Presbyterians established the Iloilo Mission Hospital in 1901, the first Protestant and American founded hospital in the country while the Baptists established the Jaro Evangelical Church, the first Baptist church in the islands, and the Central Philippine University in 1905, which was founded by William Valentine through a grant given by the American industrialist, oil magnate and philanthropist John D.

Description A juvenile magnificent tree frog, before the development of large parotoid glands The magnificent tree frog is a relatively large tree frog, with the males reaching a length (SVL) of 10.4 cm (4.1 in) and the females 10.6 cm (4.2 in).\\"Litoria splendida (SVL = 118 [mm]) \\" They have olive to bright green dorsal surfaces with white ventral surfaces. The undersides of the feet and legs are bright yellow. Most specimens have white or sulphur-coloured dots on their backs, of varying densities. The older magnificent tree frogs can be distinguished from White's tree frogs by the presence of very large parotoid glands, which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana. The tympanum is large, almost the size of the eye, and partially obscured by the parotoid gland. Ecology and behaviour Magnificent tree frog Magnificent tree frogs are native to the Kimberley region of Western Australia, and enter caves and rock crevices during the day. Much like the other large tree frogs in Australia, White's tree frog and the giant tree frog, they inhabit areas near humans, and can be found around buildings and in toilets, showers, and water tanks. They are nocturnal, and will hunt and breed at night. Breeding probably takes place during the wet season. The male's call is very similar to that of White's tree frog, a deep \\"crawk-crawk-crawk\\" repeated many times. The breeding habits of the magnificent tree frog have not been extensively studied.

Synopsis  Barbarian hordes had invaded and the border towns were overrun. The call went out for able-bodied men to join the army. Hua Mulan returned home from her hunting to find that her frail father had been summoned. Her brother was too young to enlist so she volunteered to take her father's place but her parents rejected the idea. Determined to convince her father, she conspired with her cousin and elder sister. Dressed as a man, she sparred with her father. Both astonished and impressed, he gave her his blessings to join the army. A screenshot from the film. With her cousin accompanying her, she joined the ranks of army recruits and managed to impress the General in the recruits martial trials. In the 12 years of fighting, she rose through the ranks and attained the status of general. Through this period, she became fast friends with the group of recruits she was with and General Li. The war eventually drew to a close with an ambush and capture of the barbarian king. The Commanding General of the army threw a celebratory feast, after which, he drew Mulan aside to discuss a matter with her. He was especially impressed with her abilities and character and wished to betroth his daughter to Mulan. Unable to reveal the truth about her identity and reluctant to refuse him outright for fear of offending him, Mulan dodged the issue by pretending to be feeling weak from her wound received in the last battle. A few days later, having officially resigned her post, she took leave of her comrades and returned home with her cousin. The Commanding General, however, had not forgotten the proposal and was determined to have Mulan as a son-in-law and served in the government. He sent General Li with some of her comrades bearing wedding gifts to her home. When they arrived, they were shocked and astonished to find that their courageous and heroic comrade turned out to be a lady. General Li agreed to explain to the Commanding General on Mulan's behalf. Before he left, he exchanged betrothal tokens with Mulan, exhorting her to wait for him.

It was formerly considered conspecific with the greater flamingo, but that treatment is now widely viewed (e.g. by the American and British Ornithologists' Unions) as incorrect due to a lack of evidence. It is also known as the Caribbean flamingo, although it is also present in the Gal√°pagos Islands. It is the only flamingo that naturally inhabits North America. Distribution Skull MHNT The American flamingo breeds in the Gal√°pagos Islands, coastal Colombia, Venezuela and nearby islands, northern Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, along the northern coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti), the Bahamas, Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and in extreme southern Florida. The population in the Gal√°pagos Islands differs genetically from that in the Caribbean, and the Gal√°pagos flamingos are significantly smaller, exhibit sexual dimorphism in body shape, and lay smaller eggs. They are sometimes separated as Phoenicopterus ruber glyphorhynchus. Its preferred habitats are similar to those of its relatives: saline lagoons, mudflats, and shallow, brackish coastal or inland lakes. An example habitat is the Petenes mangroves ecoregion of the Yucat√°n. = In Florida = Flamingos in Florida The American flamingo is also found in South Florida and the Florida Keys, both of which were likely the northernmost extent of its distribution. The existence of flamingo eggs in museum collections labeled as collected from Florida indicates that they likely nested there as well. Since the arrival of Europeans, the population started to decline, up until the 1900s, where it was considered completely extirpated. During the 1950s, birds from the captive population at Hialeah Park frequently escaped, thus leading to the conclusion that all modern flamingos in Florida were escapees, although at least one bird banded as a chick in the Yucat√°n Peninsula has been sighted in Everglades National Park, and others may be vagrant birds from Cuba . However, a study published in 2018, involving an abandoned young flamingo named Conchy found in Key West, indicates that the occasional flamingos observed in parts of Florida are in fact natives, with some even permanently staying in Florida Bay year-round. The study also indicated that these flamingos may be increasing in population and reclaiming their lost range, slowly but steadily returning home. Large flocks of flamingos are still known to visit Florida from time to time, most notably in 2014, when a very large flock of over 147 flamingos temporarily stayed at Stormwater Treatment Area 2, on Lake Okeechobee, with a few returning the following year. From a distance, untrained eyes can also confuse it with the roseate spoonbill. Description Close-up of head at S√£o Paulo Zoo, Brazil The American flamingo is a large wading bird with reddish-pink plumage. Like all flamingos, it lays a single chalky-white egg on a mud mound, between May and August; incubation until hatching takes from 28 to 32 days; both parents brood the young for a period up to 6 years when they reach sexual maturity. Their life expectancy of 40 years is one of the longest in birds. Adult American flamingos are smaller on average than greater flamingos, but are the largest flamingos in the Americas. They measure from tall. The males weigh an average of , while females average . Most of its plumage is pink, giving rise to its earlier name of rosy flamingo and differentiating adults from the much paler greater flamingo. The wing coverts are red, and the primary and secondary flight feathers are black. The bill is pink and white with an extensive black tip. The legs are entirely pink. The call is a goose-like honking. A flock at Whipsnade Zoo A group of immature birds at Lago de Oviedo, Dominican Republic It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. Mating and bonding behaviors Mating and bonding behaviors of P. ruber individuals have been extensively studied in captivity. The American flamingo is usually monogamous when selecting a nest site, and incubating and raising young; however, extra-pair copulations are frequent. The flock flight at Cayo Coco, Cuba While males usually initiate courtship, females control the process. If interest is mutual, a female walks by the male, and if the male is receptive, he walks with her. Both parties make synchronized movements until one member aborts this process. For low-intensity courtships, males and females walk in unison with their heads raised. In high-intensity courtships, males and females walk at a quick pace with their heads dropped in a false feeding posture. This high-intensity courtship stops at any point if either bird turns and the other does not follow, the heads are raised, unison movements are stopped, or the pace of movement is slowed. If the female is ultimately receptive to copulation, she stops walking and presents for the male. Long- term pairs do not frequently engage in courtship behaviors or in-group display. Pairs often stand, sleep, and eat in close proximity. Courtship is most often seen among individuals that change partners often or are promiscuous. A spectrum of pairing relationships is seen. Some birds have a long-term partner throughout the year; others form pairs during periods of courtship and nest attendance. How long a relationship lasts is affected by many factors, including addition and removal of adults, maturation of juveniles, and occurrence of trios and quartets. In most pairs, both individuals usually construct and defend the nest site. In rare cases, one individual undertakes both duties. Within trios, the dominant pair begins the nesting process by choosing and then defending the site. For trios with one male and two females, the subordinate female is tolerated by the male, but often fights with the dominant female. If two females share a nest and both lay an egg, one female will try to destroy the other egg or roll it out of the nest. For trios with two males and one female, the subordinate male is tolerated by both individuals and often becomes the primary incubator and caregiver of the chicks. For quartets, the dominant male and two females take care of the nest, while the subordinate male remains around the periphery, never gaining access to the nest. Less animosity is observed between the dominant and subordinate females in quartets compared to trios. The egg is attended constantly and equally by alternating parents. Chicks at the nest are attended constantly by alternating parents, up to 7‚Äì11 days of age. Most attentive periods during incubation and brooding last 21‚Äì60 hours, both in the case where the ‚Äòoff-duty‚Äô parents remain in the same lagoon to feed, or (when breeding occurs in lagoons deficient in food), they fly to other lagoons to feed. Nest reliefs during incubation take place predominantly in late afternoon, or early morning. Phoenicopterus ruber - MHNT A chick and its mother The time for receiving food from parents decreases from hatching to about 105 days, and the decrease is greatest after the chicks have left the nest at 7‚Äì11 days to band into cr√®ches. The frequency and the duration of feeds by male and female partners do not differ significantly. After chicks have left the nest, feeds are predominantly nocturnal. Adaptations The American flamingo has adapted to its shallow-water environment in several ways. It has evolved long legs and large webbed feet to wade and stir up the bottom of the water bed to bring up their food source to then be retrieved. To feed, it has evolved a specialized beak which is hooked downward and features marginal lamellae on the upper mandible, and inner and outer lamellae on both the upper and lower mandibles. These are adapted for filtering out differently sized food from water. Depending on the food source in their area, diets depend on the exact morphology of their beaks on what can and cannot be strained out of them. It submerges its head under water to retrieve its food, and may have its head under water for long times, which requires it to hold its breath. Factors which affect the habitat choice of American flamingos are environmental temperatures, water depth, food source, accessibility of an area, and the presence of vegetation beds in feeding areas. If available food items do not meet the needs of the flamingos or the temperature is not appropriate to their requirements, they move to a better feeding or more temperate area. Osmoregulation The role of osmoregulation‚Äîthe maintenance of a precise balance of solute and water concentrations within the body‚Äîis performed by a number of bodily functions working together. In P. ruber, the kidney, the lower gastrointestinal tract, and the salt glands work together to maintain the homeostasis between ions and fluids. In mammals, the kidneys and urinary bladder are the primary organs used in osmoregulation. Birds, however, lack a urinary bladder and must compensate using these three organs. American flamingos are saltwater birds that ingest food with a high salt content and mostly drink salt water (with an osmolarity of usually 1000), hyperosmotic to the bodies cells . Also, though not commonly, they can drink fresh water at near-boiling temperatures from geysers. From their high-salt diet, they would lose more water and have a greater salt uptake. One way in which they osmoregulate is through the use of a salt gland, which is found in their beaks. This salt gland helps excrete excess salt from the body through the nasal openings in the flamingo's beaks. When these birds consume salt, the osmolarity increases in the blood plasma through the gut. This causes water to move out of the cells, increasing extracellular fluids. Both these changes, in turn, activate the salt glands of the bird, but before any activity occurs in the salt glands, the kidney has to reabsorb the ingested sodium from the small intestine. As seen in other saltwater birds, the fluid that is excreted has been seen to have an osmolarity greater than that of the salt water, but this varies with salt consumption and body size. As food and saltwater are ingested, sodium and water absorption begins through the walls of the gut and into the extracellular fluid. Sodium is then circulated to the kidney, where the plasma undergoes filtration by the renal glomerulus. Although birds' kidneys tend to be larger in size, they are inefficient in producing concentrated urine that is significantly hyperosmotic to their blood plasma. This form of secretion would cause dehydration from water loss. Therefore, sodium and water are reabsorbed into the plasma by renal tubules. This increase in osmotic plasma levels causes extracellular fluid volume to increase, which triggers receptors in both the brain and heart. These receptors then stimulate salt gland secretion and sodium is able to efficiently leave the body through the nares while maintaining a high body water level. Flamingos, like many other marine birds, have a high saline intake, yet even the glomular filtration rate (GFR) remains unchanged. This is because of the salt glands; high concentrations of sodium are present in the renal filtrate, but can be reabsorbed almost completely where it is excreted in high concentrations in the salt glands. Renal reabsorption can be increased through the output of the antidiuretic hormone called arginine vasotacin (AVT). AVT opens protein channels in the collection ducts of the kidney called aquaporins. Aquaporins increase the membrane permeability to water, as well as causes less water to move from the blood and into the kidney tubules. =Specialized osmoregulatory cells and transport mechanisms= The salt gland used by the American flamingo has two segments, a medial and lateral segment. These segments are tube shaped glands that consist of two cell types. The first is the cuboidal ‚Äì peripheral cells which are small, triangular shaped cells which have only a few mitochondria. The second specialized cells are the principal cells which are found down the length of the secretory tubules, and are rich in mitochondria. These cells are similar to the mitochondria rich cells found in teleost fish. These cells within the salt gland employ several types of transport mechanisms that respond to osmoregulatory loads. Sodium- Potassium ATPase works with a Sodium-Chloride cotransporter (also known as the NKCC), and a basal potassium channel to secrete salt (NaCl) into secretory tubes. The ATPase uses energy from ATP to pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into the cell. The potassium channel allows potassium ions to diffuse out of the cell. The cotransporter pumps one sodium, potassium and two chloride ions into the cell. The chloride ion diffuses through the apical membrane into the secretory tube and the sodium follows via a paracellular route. This is what forms the hyperosmotic solution within the salt glands. Circulatory system Although there has been little investigation on the specific circulatory and cardiovascular system of the phoenicopteridae, they possess the typical features of an avian circulatory system. As is seen in other aves, the flamingo's circulatory system is closed maintaining a separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. This maximizes their efficiency to meet their high metabolic needs during flight. Due to this need for increased cardiac output, the avian heart tends to be larger in relation to body mass than what is seen in most mammals. =Heart type and features= The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the hearts pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. =Organization of circulatory system= Similar to the atrium, the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow. Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur. Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the left ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body. With respect to thermoregulation, the American flamingo has highly vascularized feet that use a countercurrent exchange system in their legs and feet. This method of thermoregulation keeps a constant gradient between the veins and arteries that are in close proximity in order to maintain heat within the core and minimize heat loss or gain in the extremities. Heat loss is minimized while wading in cold water, while heat gain is minimized in the hot temperatures during rest and flight. =Physical and chemical properties of pumping blood= Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. Birds, like the flamingo, have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The American flamingo's four-chambered heart is myogenic, meaning that all the muscle cells and fibers have the ability to contract rhythmically. The rhythm of contraction is controlled by the pace maker cells which have a lower threshold for depolarization. The wave of electrical depolarization initiated here is what physically starts the heart's contractions and begins pumping blood. Pumping blood creates variations in blood pressure and as a result, creates different thicknesses of blood vessels. The Law of LaPlace can be used to explain why arteries are relatively thick and veins are thin. =Blood composition= It was widely thought that avian blood had special properties which attributed to a very efficient extraction and transportation of oxygen in comparison to mammalian blood. This is not true; there is no real difference in the efficiency of the blood, and both mammals and birds use a hemoglobin molecule as the primary oxygen carrier with little to no difference in oxygen carrying capacity. Captivity and age have been seen to have an effect on the blood composition of the American flamingo. A decrease in white blood cell numbers was predominate with age in both captive and free living flamingos, but captive flamingos showed a higher white blood cell count than free living flamingos. One exception occurs in free living flamingos with regards to white blood cell count. The number of eosinophils in free living birds are higher because these cells are the ones that fight off parasites with which a free living bird may have more contact than a captive one. Captive birds showed higher hematocrit and red blood cell numbers than the free living flamingos, and a blood hemoglobin increase was seen with age. An increase in hemoglobin would correspond with an adults increase in metabolic needs. A smaller mean cellular volume recorded in free living flamingos coupled with similar mean hemoglobin content between captive and free living flamingos could show different oxygen diffusion characteristics between these two groups. Plasma chemistry remains relatively stable with age but lower values of protein content, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids were seen in free living flamingos. This trend can be attributed to shortages and variances in food intake in free living flamingos. =Blood composition and osmoregulation= Avian erythrocytes (red blood cells) have been shown to contain approximately ten times the amount of taurine (an amino acid) as mammal erythrocytes. Taurine has a fairly large list of physiological functions; but in birds, it can have an important influence on osmoregulation. It helps the movement of ions in erythrocytes by altering the permeability of the membrane and regulating osmotic pressure within the cell. The regulation of osmotic pressure is achieved by the influx or efflux of taurine relative to changes in the osmolarity of the blood. In a hypotonic environment, cells will swell and eventually shrink; this shrinkage is due to efflux of taurine. This process also works in the opposite way in hypertonic environments. In hypertonic environments cells tend to shrink and then enlarge; this enlargement is due to an influx in taurine, effectively changing the osmotic pressure. This adaptation allows the flamingo to regulate between differences in salinity. Respiratory system Relatively few studies have focused on the flamingo respiratory system, however little to no divergences from the standard avian anatomical design have occurred in their evolutionary history. Nevertheless, some physiological differences do occur in the flamingo and structurally similar species. The respiratory system is not only important for efficient gas exchange, but for thermoregulation and vocalization. Thermoregulation is important for flamingos as they generally live in warm habitats and their plush plumage increases body temperature. Heat loss is accomplished through thermal polypnea (panting), that is an increase in respiratory rate. It has been seen that the medulla, hypothalamus and mid-brain are involved in the control of panting, as well through the Hering-Breuer reflex that uses stretch receptors in the lungs, and the vagus nerve. This effect of the panting is accelerated by a process called gular fluttering; rapid flapping of membranes in the throat which is synchronized with the movements of the thorax. Both of these mechanisms promote evaporative heat loss, which allows for the bird to push out warm air and water from the body. Increases in respiratory rate would normally cause respiratory alkalosis because carbon dioxide levels are rapidly dropping in the body, but the flamingo is able to bypass this, most likely through a shunt mechanism, which allow it to still maintain a sustainable partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Since the avian integument is not equipped with sweat glands, cutaneous cooling is minimal. Because the flamingo's respiratory system is shared with multiple functions, panting must be controlled to prevent hypoxia. For a flamingo, having such a long neck means adapting to an unusually long trachea. Tracheas are an important area of the respiratory tract; aside from directing air in and out of the lungs, it has the largest volume of dead space in the tract. Dead space in avians is around 4.5 times higher in mammals of roughly the same size. In particular, flamingos have a trachea that is longer than its body length with 330 cartilaginous rings. As a result, they have a calculated dead space twice as high as another bird of the same size. To compensate for the elongation, they usually breathe in deep, slow patterns. One hypothesis for the bird's adaptation to respiratory alkalosis is tracheal coiling. Tracheal coiling is an overly long extension of the trachea and can often wrap around the bird's body. When faced with a heat load, birds often use thermal panting and this adaptation of tracheal coiling allows ventilation of non-exchange surfaces which can enable the bird to avoid respiratory alkalosis. The flamingo uses a \\"flushout\\" pattern of ventilation where deeper breaths are essentially mixed in with shallow panting to flush out carbon dioxide and avoid alkalosis. The increased length of the trachea provides a greater ability for respiratory evaporation and cooling off without hyperventilation. Thermoregulation Thermoregulation is a matter of keeping a consistent body temperature regardless of the surrounding ambient temperature. Flamingos require both methods of efficient heat retention and release. Even though the American flamingo resides mainly close to the equator where there is relatively little fluctuation in temperature, seasonal and circadian variations in temperature must be accounted for. Like all animals, flamingos maintain a relatively constant basal metabolic rate (BMR); the metabolic rate of an animal in its thermoneutral zone (TNZ) while at rest. The BMR is a static rate which changes depending on factors such as the time of day or seasonal activity. Like most other birds, basic physiological adaptations control both heat loss in warm conditions and heat retention in cooler conditions. Using a system of countercurrent blood flow, heat is efficiently recycled through the body rather than being lost through extremities such as the legs and feet. Living in the equatorial region of the world, the American flamingo has little variation in seasonal temperature changes. However, as a homeothermic endotherm it is still faced with the challenge of maintaining a constant body temperature while being exposed to both the day (light period) and night (dark period) temperatures of its environments. Phoenicopterus ruber have evolved a number of thermoregulatory mechanisms to keep itself cool during the light period and warm during the dark period without expending too much energy. The American flamingo has been observed in a temperature niche between . In order to prevent water loss through evaporation when temperatures are elevated the flamingo will employ hyperthermia as a nonevaporative heat loss method keeping its body temperature between . This allows heat to leave the body by moving from an area of high body temperature to an area of a lower ambient temperature. Flamingos are also able to use evaporative heat loss methods such as, cutaneous evaporative heat loss and respiratory evaporative heat loss. During cutaneous heat loss, Phoenicopterus ruber relies on evaporation off of the skin to reduce its body temperature. This method is not very efficient as it requires evaporation to pass through the plumage. A more efficient way to reduce its body temperature is through respiratory evaporative heat loss, where the flamingo engages in panting to expel excessive body heat. During the dark period the flamingos tend to tuck their heads beneath their wing to conserve body heat. They may also elicit shivering as a means of muscular energy consumption to produce heat as needed. P. ruber stands on one leg in order to retain body heat One of the most distinctive attribute of P. ruber is its unipedal stance, or the tendency to stand on one leg. While the purpose of this iconic posture remains ultimately unanswered, strong evidence supports its function in regulating body temperature. Like most birds, the largest amount of heat is lost through the legs and feet; having long legs can be a major disadvantage when temperatures fall and heat retention is most important. By holding one leg up against the ventral surface of the body, the flamingo lowers the surface area by which heat exits the body. Moreover, it has been observed that during periods of increased temperatures such as mid- day, flamingos will stand on both legs. Holding a bipedal stance multiplies the amount of heat lost from the legs and further regulates body temperature. Migration Like other flamingo species, American flamingos will migrate short distances to ensure that they get enough food or because their current habitat has been disturbed in some way. One habitat disturbance that has been observed to cause flamingos to leave their feeding grounds is elevated water levels. These conditions make it difficult for Phoenicopterus ruber to wade, hindering their ability to access food. The flamingos will then abandon their feeding grounds in search of an alternate food source. While the flights are not as long as other migratory birds, flamingos still fly for periods without eating. Metabolism For the most part flamingos are not all that different from other salt water wading birds. They will fast when migrating to a new habitat or the chicks may not receive food daily depending on food availability.

The organization has active chapters in Brazil, Chile, Italy, Spain and the U.S., and recently in Canada and Iran. The Spanish and U.S. chapters each have international members. Each of the chapters has regular meetings and organizes sessions at national sociological conferences, and there is an affiliated online, peer-reviewed journal.  Overview  The group's central pedagogical aim is to develop a globally inclusive sociological curriculum. Its epistemological premise is that human rights and collective goods (including sustainable natural resources and participatory democracy) are two aspects of the same concept. As Sociologists, the group advances human rights by working through communities, societies, the workplace, and other social institutions. They advance the right to decent employment, social security, education, housing, food security, health care, the rights to cultural, racial, religious, and to an identity and sexual preference. Human rights also includes gender equality and the principle that vulnerable groups need special protections, including children, the aged, the disabled, oppressed racial and ethnic minorities, migrants, and indigenous peoples. These principles are drawn from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) that recognizes ‚Äúthe inherent dignity‚Äù and ‚Äúthe equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family,‚Äù from various United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's treaties and declarations on culture. Human rights are realized with the advance and protection of common (collective) goods, including a sustainable environment, transparent laws and government, natural resources, the internet and information grids, fair trade, food sovereignty (the rights of farmers and fishers to manage their own resources), and participatory democracy. Indeed, human rights are themselves common goods because they are indivisible and inclusive. The group's framework is considered utopian, and Sociologists Without Borders takes the view that this is necessary in a world in crisis: wars, civil strife, diminishing environmental resources, epidemics, and the growing economic gap between the Global North and the Global South. What this pessimistic account leaves out, and what Sociologists without Borders stresses, is that there are growing interdependencies and solidarities around the world and these draw less from nation-states than they do from the capabilities and resourcefulness of ordinary people.  The SSF Think Tank  On July 25, 2008, the SSF US Chapter released an online discussion platform for reflection and discussion among concerned sociologists, other social scientists, NGOs, governments, academics, students, activists, journalists, and individuals who want to discover and hopefully help fight the \\"Challenges to Human Rights\\" in a global environment. This can be accessed at The SSF Think Tank. This has since been taken over by The Development Cafe and is now run as Global Sociology Network, independent of the SSF.  2010 Arizona Boycott  In response to Arizona SB 1070, SSF petitioned Arizona Governor Jan Brewer to roll back the law, stating: \\"SSF believes that Arizona Law SB1070 is a form of racial profiling and discrimination because officers will likely rely on appearance, phenotypes, language and accents to make judgments that will lead to the unnecessary harassment or detention of US citizens and residents, including SSF members and other Sociologists.\\" SSF began a boycott of public and private entities within Arizona and encouraged their members not to travel to the state.

Being nationally determined, Petar Konjovic‚Äôs musical language is founded on and belongs to the period of late romanticism. However, it includes elements of impressionism and expressionism which was characteristic for many composers of 1920s and 1930s (Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, Sibelius). Likewise, his musical directions towards folklore expressionism also included him in the group of musicians close to Leosh Janachek, Bella Bartok, Igor Stravinsky which belong to the early ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù period.International Competition Petar Konjovic, Konjoviƒá's Biography In his operas, he focused on setting texts that were related to historical events and individuals, and his vocal writings was strongly influenced by the natural inflection of his native language. Folk elements are also very much in evidence in his scores, which are distinguished by exceptionally colorful orchestrations.A Short History of Opera by Donald Grout, Hermine Weigel Williams, Columbia University Press, Sep 5, 2003 page 692 His Czech experience encouraged his natural inclination toward folk sources and he began developing melodies, like Jan√°ƒçek, out of the inflection of speech.

It is located in the district of Koy Sanjaq. There are several churches in the village; the church of Mart Mariam was constructed in 1868, and underwent renovations in 1979 and 2009. There is also a shrine to Mart Shmune and a church of Mar Michael. The 4th century monastery of Mar Behnam was located near the village, but was destroyed by Iraqi soldiers during the Al-Anfal campaign in 1988. The monastery was later partially rebuilt and reopened on 12 April 1996. Etymology Several theories have been put forward for the origin of the Syriac name of the village, as it may derive from \\"ara\\" (\\"land\\" in Syriac) and \\"mota\\" (\\"death\\" in Syriac), and thus translate to \\"land of death\\", or could be a combination of \\"ara\\" and \\"n≈´·π≠ƒÅ\\" (\\"oil\\" in Syriac), and translate to \\"land of oil\\". The former etymology is attributed to the local legend of a large battle between Christians and Muslims, or of a plague that devastated the village. Alternatively, Armota may stem from \\"armune\\" (\\"pomegranate\\" in Syriac). History According to local tradition, Armota was extant at the time of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in 638, and paid jizya to the Muslim army led by Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas that had encamped near the village at a site called tent hill. The inhabitants of Armota were adherents of the Church of the East until converted to Chaldean Catholicism in 1779 by Archbishop Yohannan Hormizd. There were 25-38 Assyrian families in the village in 1843, with one priest and one church. In 1913, 100 Chaldean Catholics populated Armota, and were served by one priest and one functioning church as part of the archdiocese of Kirkuk. The village was pillaged in 1943, and again later in 1963 by Iraqi soldiers during the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War, at which time it was inhabited by 105 Assyrian families. Armota was used as a military camp by the Iraqi army in 1988 during the Al-Anfal campaign. The unannounced construction of a mosque at Armota by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1999 led to tensions between Assyrians and Kurds in the area as no Muslims inhabited the village at that time, and after Assyrian protests at Koy Sanjaq it was agreed that the mosque would remain, but the minaret and other additional buildings would not be built, and the call to prayer would not be permitted. The village was solely inhabited by Assyrians until settled by Kurds in the late 20th/early 21st century. By 2003, the population had declined to 70 families. In the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Assyrians from urban centres fled to Armota to escape insurgent attacks. The infrastructure of the village was developed with investment from the Assyrian politician Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo in the 2000s. In 2012, 99 Assyrian families, including 40 Chaldean families, and 27 Kurdish families, resided in the village, and the Assyrian population grew to 118 families by March 2018. The village was bombarded by Iranian artillery on 8 September 2018, and its population took refuge in Koy Sanjaq. The Assyrian population in the village largely speak Kurdish, but some continue to speak Syriac.

It is the antithesis of the Stoic doctrine of katalepsis (i.e., the ability to apprehend).George Henry Lewes, 1863, The biographical history of philosophy, Volume 1, page 297 According to the Stoics, katalepsis was true perception, but to the Pyrrhonists and Academic Skeptics, no perception could be known to be true. All perceptions were thus acataleptic, i.e. what, if any, conformity between the object and the perception of that object was unknown and, for the Academic Skeptics, could never be known. For the Academic Skeptics, acatalepsy meant that human knowledge never amounts to certainty, but only to plausibility. For the Pyrrhonists it meant that knowledge was limited to the phantasiai (appearances) and the pathƒì. The Pyrrhonists attempted to show, while Academic Skeptics asserted, an absolute acatalepsia; all human science or knowledge, according to them, went no further than to appearances and verisimilitude.

Born in Virginia, he was the son of immigrants from northern Ireland. He was important to the early settlement of the U.S. Commonwealth of Kentucky, where he moved with his family from Virginia. He served with the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was married and his eleven children lived to adulthood, settling as far West as Oregon. At the age of 64, Whitley signed up to serve in the War of 1812. He was killed in Canada at the Battle of the Thames; some accounts credit him with killing Tecumseh, a Shawnee leader allied with the British. Early life and family William Whitley was the son of Solomon Whitley and Elizabeth Barnett, immigrants from Ireland who settled in Augusta County, Virginia. (They were likely from Northern Ireland and Protestant.) He was the oldest of four sons and is thought to have had five sisters as well. About 1771 or as late as 1775, Whitley married Esther Fullen, also from Virginia. A few years later, he proposed that they move from Virginia to the western frontier across the Appalachian Mountains.Biographical Cyclopedia, p. 273 When she approved, he organized an expedition with his brother-in-law, George Clark.Ellison, p. 949 The pair met another party of seven pioneers; the two parties combined and continued with their expedition. After scouting a location near a branch of the Dix River called Cedar Creek, they returned to Virginia to prepare for a permanent move west. The families left Virginia in November 1775, shortly before the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. When they reached their new site, Whitley planted of corn to establish his claim to the land. He and his family moved to the safety of St. Asaph's fort (present-day Stanford, Kentucky), as the local Shawnee and Cherokee resisted European-American encroachment in their territory. In 1763, the British had promised the Native Americans that this area west of the mountains would be a reserve for them and prohibited to colonists. Not feeling safe, the Whitley and Benjamin Logan families moved to the protection of Fort Harrod, near present-day Harrodsburg, Kentucky. In this period, Whitley saw the body of William Ray, who had been scalped by Indians. Many years later, when dictating his memoir to his son-in-law, Phillip Soublett, Whitley said that Ray's body was the first he had seen scalped. He was horrified and considered the Indians brutal for what he considered mutilation. During the Revolutionary War in 1779, Whitley discovered the mutilated bodies of the Starnese family near Blue Lick (south of Boonesborough, Kentucky) and documented the find.Hardin There was continued warfare with Cherokee in the region during the revolution. Military career After the Revolutionary War, Whitley volunteered for service in George Rogers Clark's expedition against Indians in the Northwest Territory. He was assigned to Captain John Montgomery's Company, which accompanied Clark's forces. During his military career, Whitley was known to scalp many natives as a militia leader and frontiersman. By 1779, Whitley had returned for his family and permanently settled on the land he had claimed years earlier in what is now Kentucky. By the 1790s, the settlement at St. Asaph's developed into the town of Stanford. Whitley and his family built a large brick house outside town, near what would later become Crab Orchard, Kentucky. The plantation was named Sportsman's Hill. It was the first brick house built in Kentucky and still stands, preserved as the William Whitley House State Historic Site. The house includes a secret passage for escape and survival during raids by Native Americans. The plantation originally included a racetrack. This racetrack set several traditions for horse racing in the United States. It had the first clay (instead of turf) track in the United States and here horses were raced counterclockwise (instead of clockwise, as was the British tradition). In 1792, Isaac Shelby, the newly elected governor of Kentucky, commissioned Whitley as a major in the 6th Regiment of the Kentucky militia. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel the following year. In 1794, he led 200 militiamen in a highly successful raid against a Chickamauga village in Tennessee. The Chickamauga were a band of Cherokee, referred to by the geographic area where they lived. In 1813, at the age of 64, Whitley returned to military service. He volunteered in the Kentucky Mounted Infantry during the War of 1812 with Great Britain. In the Battle of the Thames, on October 5, 1813, he led the \\"Forlorn Hope\\" charge against Tecumseh's forces. Both Tecumseh and Whitley were killed in the battle. Whitley was buried near the battleground, in Chatham, Ontario. Militia colleagues returned his horse, Emperor, his powder horn, strap, and rifle to his wife in Kentucky after the war. The rifle is currently on display at the William Whitley House State Historic Site. Some primary accounts suggest that Whitley was likely the person who killed Tecumseh. Richard Mentor Johnson is generally credited with killing the Shawnee leader. James A Drain, Sr. published an autobiography, Single Handed (1927), in which he recounts Whitley's granddaughter telling their family tradition that Whitley and Tecumseh killed each other simultaneously.Drain (1927), pp. 16-18 Political career In 1797, Whitley served a single term in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He also represented Lincoln County as a commissioner of the Kentucky River Company in 1801. Legacy and honors *In 1818, Whitley County, Kentucky, and its county seat, Williamsburg, were named for the colonel. *A plaque on the Whitley County Courthouse credits Colonel Whitley with killing the last Indian (probably Cherokee) in the county. *In addition, the census-designated place Whitley City, Kentucky, is named after the colonel. *In 1838, Whitley County, Indiana, was named after him. *One of his grandsons was William L. Sublette, a fur trader who became co-owner of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company with Jedediah Smith and David Edward Jackson. Sublette was a member of the original fur- trapping expedition known as Ashley's Hundred. *The 20th-century Andromeda- class attack cargo ship USS Whitley was named for the Whitley counties in Kentucky and Indiana. Family William and Esther Whitley had eleven children, all of whom survived to maturity. These were: # Elizabeth (Mrs. Robert Stevenson) b Augusta, Virginia, 1772, d Huntsville, Alabama, 1830. # Isabella (Mrs. Phillip Sublette), b Virginia, about 1774, d Kentucky about 1820.

It was one of the top banking institutions. From 1974 to 1983, the bank was run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Storrs. What was NCNB forms the core of today's Bank of America. History In 1957 American Trust Co. (founded 1901)The American Trust Company was a bank established in Charlotte in 1901.Estate of J. Luther Snyder, George C. Snyder and American Trust Company, Executors Appellants, v. United States of America, Appellee., 285 F.2d 857 (4th Cir. 1961) and Commercial National Bank (founded 1876) merged to form American Commercial Bank in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1960 American Commercial Bank merged with Greensboro-based Security National Bank to form North Carolina National Bank. While American Commercial was the nominal survivor, the merged bank gave up American Commercial's state charter to operate under the Greensboro bank's national charter. In 1969, it reorganized as a holding company, NCNB Corporation. In 1986, NCNB announced plans for an 875-foot signature skyscraper in downtown Charlotte that would serve as its corporate headquarters. In 1991, while construction was underway, NCNB acquired C&S;/Sovran Corp. of Atlanta and Norfolk and took the new name, NationsBank. The new skyscraper opened in 1992 as NationsBank Corporate Center. In 1998 NationsBank acquired BankAmerica Corp. and took the name Bank of America which now operates in all 50 states. The transaction was run by Hugh McColl. Bank of America retains NCNB/NationsBank's pre-1998 stock price history, and is headquartered at what is now Bank of America Corporate Center. The former North Carolina National Bank Building at Burlington, North Carolina was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

On June 1, 2014, CTA and Pace stopped accepting these cards as part of a transition to Ventra. The blue Chicago Card was a stored value card. Users added value to the card at CTA vending machines or at select retail locations, and turnstiles or fareboxes deducted value from the card. Users usually registered cards with CTA and could receive a replacement in the event of theft, loss, or damage to the card. The blue-and-gold Chicago Card Plus was an account-based card. Users linked the card to either a credit card, debit card, or employer-provided transit benefit program. The cards could be set up as monthly passes or on a pay-per-use basis. The account reloaded from the linked source either when the monthly pass expired or when a user-defined threshold was passed on a pay-per-use card. Because of this direct link to personal accounts, all Chicago Card Plus cards were registered by their users. History CTA's Automated Fare Collection (AFC) system was installed in 1997 by Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., the largest provider of AFC systems in the USA. The AFC system replaced the CTA's tokens with magnetic-stripe stored- value cards printed on plastic or paper based on Cubic's earlier MetroCard implementation in New York City. All fare collection and payment equipment was designed to be retrofitted at a later date with smart card readers, a technology that was on the horizon. A small pilot program (\\"Chicago Gold\\") for reduced-fare disabled riders in 1999 led to a contract with Cubic to install smart card readers universally in 2000. In August 2000, a more extensive \\"Chicago Card\\" pilot program distributed stored-value smart cards to volunteer participants. The pilot program was expanded system-wide in November 2002. The Chicago Card Plus debuted in January 2004. \\"Go Lane\\" card readers were installed in the buses, starting in 2005, allowing Chicago Card users to bypass the line of passengers using the farebox; however, only one payment could be accepted at a time, eliminating this possible efficiency. The Go Lane card readers were removed starting in May 2010 and Chicago Card card readers were moved back to the main fare box. In February 2007, CTA announced that it had settled a class action lawsuit alleging there were not enough Chicago Cards available to meet demand on January 1, 2006, when the cash fare increase went into effect, but Chicago Card users were charged the old fares. Benefits Benefits of the Chicago Card and the Chicago Card Plus included the following: *Because it was a contactless card, the card never needed to be removed from its holder, be it a wallet, purse, or backpack. (It may have needed to be removed if there was another smartcard nearby) *The Chicago Card could be reloaded at any L stop and many currency exchanges and supermarkets. *If registered, the card could be replaced. *The Chicago Card Plus was an account-based system that allowed customers to manage their account using the internet and a credit card for added convenience. *Until July 1, 2013, Chicago Card and Chicago Card Plus users paid only $2.25 at the O'Hare Blue Line station instead of the new $5 fare. Disadvantages *A 30-day pass was only possible with the Chicago Card Plus. *Unlike many other transit \\"monthly passes\\" the Chicago Card Plus only offered a \\"30 day pass,\\" meaning the pass was active for 30 days regardless of when the account is activated. This card had to be loaded twice in some months because of this feature. *In order to obtain a 30-day pass, users needed to link a credit or debit card account. Reloading at CTA/retail locations was not possible. *In order to postpone a 30-day pass (even for one day) the entire card had to be deactivated and could not be reactivated. (A new card had to be activated.) *The regular (blue-only) Chicago Card was only able to be loaded at specified CTA/retail locations. *Users were unable to transfer funds between Chicago Card and Chicago Card Plus. *The two cards had very little in common, making it difficult to choose which card to purchase. Some users found themselves possessing both cards depending on their commuting needs and financial situations. This caused riders to spend more money than necessary in order to maintain the two cards. *Because the cards were registered to discrete individuals, the CTA could track user movement through the system. *All cards expired four years from date of manufacture and had to be replaced when they expired. Though the replacement was free there was no expiry date printed on the card and recovering a balance could occasionally be difficult. *The card sometimes had to be taken out of the user's wallet if there was another smartcard close by. Student Pass In addition to the blue card, CTA also offered transit cards to students in both grammar schools and high schools. The passes included the phrase \\"STUDENT RIDING PERMIT\\", the year that the card was active, and the card's expiration date. The cards appeared in a variety of colors including pink, blue, and yellow. Student Passes could be bought at many schools and allowed students to pay $0.75 instead of the standard $2.25 fare. Disadvantages included the possibility that presentation of the passenger's student ID might be required in order for the pass to be honored and that the card was only valid on school days when school was in session (Monday through Friday, from 5:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M., excluding holidays such as Thanksgiving Day, Labor Day, Memorial Day, and the two-week winter break period including Christmas Day and New Years). Phase-Out The CTA announced it would replace the Chicago Card and other fare media with a new electronic fare payment system named Ventra. There are also reports that the Regional Transportation Authority is planning to require that Pace and Metra adopt that system. The transition to Ventra was completed in the summer of 2014.

It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017 to 2021, in which it is categorized as a regional general aviation facility. The airport is located in Pittsfield Township, but the airport is owned and operated by the City of Ann Arbor,Amy Biolchini, Pittsfield Township, residents ask federal government to block Ann Arbor airport expansion, Ann Arbor News, February 5, 2013. The airport property is currently located entirely within Pittsfield Township having been annexed by the City of Ann Arbor for water rights before Pittsfield became a charter township in 1972.Amy Biolchini, Turbulent Ride Continues for Proposed Runway Expansion at Ann Arbor Airport, Ann Arbor News, February 7, 2013. About 15 percent of the water pumped to Ann Arbor‚Äôs Water Treatment Plant comes from wells located at the city's airport. Pittsfield Township provides police and fire services to the airport when required. Despite being located entirely within the boundaries of Pittsfield, the township has no voting representation on any committee, council or board tasked with the management of airport operations.http://www.a2gov.org/departments/fleet- facility/Airport/Documents/AAC%20Bylaws.pdf The airport is located about south of the city proper. The airport is a general aviation facility with mostly smaller corporate and private aircraft, with no scheduled passenger or cargo flights. The airport is also occasionally used by aircraft transporting patients to the University of Michigan Health System. The UMHS keeps its Survival Flight helicopters at the airport, but does not keep its fixed-wing Survival Flight jet aircraft at the site because of the lack of 24-hour control tower staffing. , the airport's annual budget was around $800,000, which the city makes by renting hangars and imposing fuel surcharges; the city does not allocate funds to the airport. History and facilities Built in 1928, Ann Arbor Municipal Airport is a class B-II airport. The Ann Arbor City Council established an Airport Advisory Committee in 1961; the Ann Arbor city council appoints seven people (full voting members), serving three-year terms, and Pittsfield Charter Township and Lodi Township each appoint a non-voting representative to the Committee.Airport Advisory Committee , City of Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Municipal Airport covers and has two runways: * Main Runway 6/24: , surface: Concrete * Secondary Runway 12/30: , surface: Grass The grass runway intersects the paved runway, and is used during the summertime. In 2013 there were almost 170 aircraft hangars at the airport. The airport has an operating control tower which is operated by the FAA. The airport is located in FAA Class \\"D\\" airspace. In 2012, there were 64,000 takeoffs and landings at the airport, many attributed to flight school airplanes operating at the airport. A January 2013 tally reported 166 aircraft based at the airport: 138 single-engine propeller airplanes (including one ultralight), sixteen multi- engine propeller airplanes, one jet airplane and eleven helicopters.Petition to Deny Approval and Funding for the Major Runway Extension Project at Ann Arbor Municipal Airport (ARB) Located in Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan, before the Secretary of Transportation, January 28, 2013. For 2011, there were an average of 161 aircraft operations per day, and operations were 64 percent local general aviation and 36 percent transient general aviation. There has been a gradual reduction in operations at the airport (both itinerant and local) since a peak in 1999. Only one incident has been reported to the National Transportation Safety Board since 2000: an airplane left the side of the runway, attributed to pilot error. Before 2000, three doctors were killed on a football Saturday when they crashed into the runway. Runway expansions have been proposed since the 1980s but have been denied on each occasion by city councils. The need for runway expansion on safety grounds is unclear as purported over-runs were actually off the side of the runway and attributed to pilot error after investigation. The most recent proposed runway expansion project, first floated to the Ann Arbor City Council in 2007, proposes lengthening the runway by 800 feet, and moving the entire runway toward the south west corner of the airport (closer to neighboring residential subdivisions). This would not change the airport's classification but could affect the size of the aircraft using the airport; the decision to land is made on an individual basis at the discretion of the pilot.Judy McGovern, Ann Arbor Airport runway extension moves toward review, public hearing stage, MLive, February 2, 2009. All B-II small aircraft are currently capable of operating on the existing 3,505 ft runway without weight restriction. However, larger airplanes (jets) already do use this B-II certified runway but with weight and fuel restrictions. Any extension to the runway will not change the operation of B-II classification aircraft, but will allow larger aircraft (jets in the C-I and C-II categories) to land and operate out of the airport with full weight and fuel. The proposal is undergoing environmental impact studies, but has experienced delays because of initial inaccuracies supplied in the proposal, prolonged review by the FAA, and opposition from Pittsfield Township and the local citizens' group Committee for Preserving Community Quality, made up of citizens from Pittsfield and Lodi, as well as some Ann Arborites who view the project as too expensive or unlikely to be approved. On March 24, 2009, Pittsfield unanimously approved a Resolution Opposing Proposed Expansion of the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport Runway. Lodi Township, which is adjacent to Pittsfield on the west side and also impacted by ARB, passed a similar resolution on May 12, 2009. A legal petition has been made to the Secretary of Transportation Washington, D.C. in opposition to the proposed expansion.

It is located in the Sapna valley in the district of Amadiya. In the village, there is a church of Mart Shmune. History The church of Mart Shmune was first constructed in the 6th century. A Nestorian community at Bebadi is attested in the 10th-century Life of Rabban Joseph Busnaya. The village was visited by the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard in the late 1840s. In 1850, 20 Nestorian families inhabited Bebadi, and had one priest and one functioning church as part of the diocese of Berwari. The Anglican missionary William Ainger Wigram established a school in the village in 1908. A number of villagers had converted to Chaldean Catholicism by 1913. The village was the residence of Shimun XXI Eshai, Patriarch of the Church of the East, after his relocation from Quchanis in Turkey in 1927, to his exile to Cyprus in 1933, in which year 250 Assyrians inhabited Bebadi, according to a report by the League of Nations. By 1938, the population had dropped to 36 people, with 10 families, but rose to 480 people by the time of the Iraqi census of 1957. Bebadi was destroyed by Zebari Kurds during the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, and its population of 100 families was forced to flee. The village was partially restored when some villagers returned in 1963, but was destroyed again during the Al-Anfal campaign in 1987, displacing 75 families. 30 families returned after the establishment of the Iraqi no-fly zones in the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. By 2011, the Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs had constructed 43 houses and a hall, and developed the village's infrastructure.

The most common, or \\"classical\\", type of HIV-associated nephropathy is a collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), though other forms of kidney disease may also occur. Regardless of the underlying histology, kidney disease in HIV-positive patients is associated with an increased risk of death. HIVAN may be caused by direct infection of the kidney cells by HIV, with resulting kidney damage through the viral gene products. It could also be caused by the release of cytokines during HIV infection. Usually occurs only in advanced HIV disease and approximately 80% of patients with HIVAN have a CD4 count of less than 200. HIVAN presents with nephrotic syndrome and progressive kidney failure. Despite being a cause of chronic kidney failure, kidney sizes are usually normal or large. Pathology Abnormalities involve all components of the nephron. Typical findings are that of collapsing capillary loops, areas of scarring called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), microcystic tubular dilatation that is highly echogenic, and prominent podocytes. The characteristic feature of collapsing glomerulopathy is collapse of glomerular tuft and proliferation and hyperplasia of glomerular visceral epithelial cells. Its prognosis is always poor, as it rapidly progresses to chronic kidney disease. Treatment There are no adequate data from randomised controlled trials. Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has been shown to be beneficial and should be given to all patients unless otherwise contraindicated. General renoprotective measures and the treatment of the complications of nephrotic syndrome and kidney failure are adjunctive. Corticosteroid treatment can be useful in patients who do not respond to initial treatment. There is some evidence that ciclosporin might be helpful in selective cases, however further study of both steroids and ciclosporin is needed before these types of drugs can be considered standard treatment. Incidence HIVAN is the third most common cause of end stage kidney failure among African Americans, and commonly seen in African-American patients with HIV compared to other ethnic groups. In the USA 12% of patients dying with AIDS have histologically proven HIVAN, the worldwide incidence amongst AIDS patients appears to be similar. A South African study at Tygerberg Hospital, Stellenbosch University, has shown HIVAN histology in 33/61(54%) biopsies performed in HIV positive patients.

Founded in 1974 in Longueuil (Qu√©bec) by Norbert Spehner, and originally known as Requiem magazine, Solaris is the oldest French language science-fiction and fantasy magazine in the world. History and profile Solaris not only publishes established authors, but fosters the development of young francophone creators through a strong editorial direction. Mostly published and distributed in Qu√©bec, Solaris is also known in anglophone Canada, the United States and in Europe, where it is considered to be one of the most significant francophone magazines of its field. Solaris deals in all forms of science fiction and fantasy, including horror and \\"weird\\" fiction. It publishes original material (short stories and illustrations) as well as related information, criticism, interviews and articles. Solaris sponsors an annual literary contest, the Prix Solaris, intended to encourage new authors. The Prix Solaris is open only to Canadian authors. From 1981 to 2000, the Prix Solaris had two sides : literature and graphic novels. Solaris aims to account for the existing richness of science fiction and fantasy, as well as to examine all emerging tendencies and new approaches. Whereas the growing popularity of the field is mostly spurred by its audio-visual representations, Solaris continues to support literary creation and reflection. The team responsible for Solaris includes authors such as Jo√´l Champetier (The Dragon's Eye), Yves Meynard (The Books of Knights) and √âlisabeth Vonarburg (In the Mother's Land, Reluctant Voyagers, The Silent City). Through the years, Solaris has been edited by Vonarburg, Luc Pomerleau and Hugues Morin. Champetier was the managing editor until his death in 2015. After more than twenty-five years of activity, Solaris has published nearly all significant French-Canadian science fiction and fantasy writers. Stories that have originally appeared within the pages of the magazine have gone on to win nearly a dozen Prix Aurora Awards (in addition to the eleven Auroras won by the magazine itself), almost as many Prix Bor√©al and a significant proportion of Grand Prix de la Science-Fiction et du Fantastique Qu√©b√©cois. Several of these stories can be read in the English-language anthology TesseractsQ, published by Tesseracts Books. From 1981 to 2000, Solaris also published many graphic novels short stories (bandes dessin√©es), but abandoned the publication of those in 2000 because of the shrinking of its format from magazine size to book size. Many of Qu√©bec's comic book creators were published in its pages : Andr√©-Philippe C√¥t√©, Beno√Æt Joly, Mario Gigu√®re, Julien Poitras, Marc Pageau, Robert Julien, Laurine Spehner, Christian Vadeboncoeur, √âric Lacasse and others. Illustrators contributing to the covers and the interior of the magazine include Bernard Duchesne, Mario Gigu√®re, Pierre D.

It is located in the Sapna valley in the district of Amadiya. In the village, there are churches of Mart Shmune, Mar Gewargis, and Mar Qayouma. History The church of Mart Shmune was constructed in the 5th century, and the church of Mar Qayouma was built in the 10th century. It is likely that the population of Dehi were adherents of the Church of the East long before the 14th century. In 1850, 10 Nestorian families inhabited Dehi, and had one functioning church as part of the diocese of Barwari. In the aftermath of the Assyrian genocide, Nestorians from the Upper Tyari clan found refuge and settled at Dehi in 1920. The population decreased from 140 Assyrian people in 1933 to 29 people in 1938. The Iraqi census of 1957 recorded 292 inhabitants, and this grew to 615 people, with 100 families, by 1961. The eruption of the Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish conflict in 1961 resulted in severe damage to the village in the following years, and eventually was destroyed during the Al-Anfal campaign in 1988, forcing the 50 remaining families to flee. 20 families returned after the establishment of the Iraqi no-fly zones in the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. In 2003, it was reported they had suffered from illegal confiscation of land by Kurds. The Supreme Committee of Christian Affairs had constructed 56 houses and developed the village's infrastructure by 2012, in which year Dehi was inhabited by 250 adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East. On the night of 13 July 2016, the village was seriously damaged by a fire; it was noted by villagers that Kurdistan Region firefighters arrived, but made no effort to quench the fire.

At a young age he was sold as a slave by Jin officials, but he later helped start a rebellion and eventually became a powerful general for the Xiongnu state Han Zhao, conquering most of northern China in Han Zhao's name but holding the territory under his own control. In 319, after a dispute with the Han Zhao emperor Liu Yao, he broke away from Han Zhao and formed his own state, Later Zhao, and in 329 he captured Liu Yao and conquered Han Zhao, adding western China to his empire as well. Shi Le was known as a brilliant general, but was criticized by historians for excessive cruelty during his campaigns. He also put too much power in the hands of his ambitious and even more ferocious nephew Shi Hu who, after Shi Le's death, seized power from Shi Le's son Shi Hong.  Early life  Shi Le was born in 274‚Äîbut was not named Shi Le, and certainly not with the family name Shi, as it appeared that the Jie did not use family names at the time. His likely original name is B√®i („î®);http://chardb.iis.sinica.edu.tw/char/U+3528 one other possible original name was Fule (ÂåêÂãí). His grandfather, named Yeyiyu (ËÄ∂Â•ï‰∫é), and his father, named Zhouhezhu (Âë®Êõ∑Êú±), were minor Jie chiefs, and their tribe traditionally lived in Bing Province (Âπ∂Â∑û, modern Shanxi). Shi grew up in Wuxiang (Ê≠¶ÈÑâ, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi). In 303 or 304, Bing Province suffered a major famine, and the Jie tribes were seriously affected. Shi Le's tribe spread out and became refugees. Shi and many other Jie and Xiongnu men were captured by Jin officials and sold as slaves. Eventually, he was sold to a man named Shi Huan (Â∏´ÊáΩ), but Shi Huan freed him after becoming impressed with his talents. Eventually, he became a leader of bandits, and at one point he befriended Ji Sang, one of Sima Ying the Prince of Chengdu's military commanders. Sima Ying was then stationed at Yecheng and was the most powerful of the Jin imperial princes. After Sima Ying briefly served as crown prince in 304, he was forced to flee with his brother Emperor Hui to the capital Luoyang and was deposed by Sima Yong the Prince of Hejian. Many of his subordinates, including Ji and Gongsun Fan (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Ëó©), deserted, and Gongsun eventually started a rebellion with the stated goal of restoring Sima Ying. Ji and Shi both joined the rebellion‚Äîand it was only at that time that Ji gave his friend the family name \\"Shi\\" and personal name \\"Le.\\" After Gongsun was subsequently defeated and killed, Ji became leader of the rebellion and made Shi his key general‚Äînow with the goal of avenging Sima Ying, who was forced to commit suicide in 306. However, their rebellion, while briefly successful in capturing Yecheng in 307 and killing Sima Teng (Âè∏È¶¨È®∞) the Prince of Xincai, ultimately was defeated in the winter of that year, and Shi instead joined Liu Yuan, an ethnically Xiongnu former Sima Ying subordinate who had by now declared independence from Jin and established his own state Han Zhao. Liu Yuan made him a general.  As Han Zhao general  = As commander of a roving army = For the next few years, Shi led his roving band, which he appeared to have largely recruited himself, throughout central China, losing few battles but largely interested in pillaging and not in holding territory. From the beginning, though, Shi showed willingness to accept learned men into his army to serve as advisors and officers, unlike many other agrarian revolt leaders, and he gained many followers, mostly from the Jie and other non-Han ethnicities, but including some Han as well. After Liu Yuan's death in 310, Shi continued to submit to the authority of Liu Yuan's son and successor Liu Cong. In summer 311, Shi's prestige and power increased greatly when he was able to utterly defeat the largest Jin force remaining in central China. The Jin regent Sima Yue the Prince of Donghai had died earlier that year, and the large force that he commanded was trying to escort his funeral train back to his principality of Donghai (roughly modern Linyi, Shandong). Shi Le intercepted them at Ku (Ëã¶Á∏£, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), and while the Jin force was much larger than his, Shi's force was mostly cavalry, and it surrounded and disrupted the procession of the Jin force so that it stampeded itself into oblivion. The many Jin princes and officials were captured by Shi, and Shi executed them all. Shi, from that point on, became a feared general. In summer 311, several major Han Zhao generals, including Shi, Huyan Yan, Liu Yao, and Wang Mi, converged on the Jin capital Luoyang, which had been left defenseless by Sima Yue. Without major resistance, the capital fell, and Emperor Huai of Jin was captured and later executed. Later that year, Shi captured the powerful Jin general Gou Xi (ËãüÊôû) and assassinated fellow Han Zhao general Wang, merging their forces with his own. As Shi's army grew, he increasingly trusted his young distant nephew Shi Hu as a general, and under the violent but talented Shi Hu, Shi Le's army became known for its cruel treatment of civilians but was also whipped into shape, rarely losing battles. In spring 312, though, Shi Le, preparing to have his army cross the Yangtze River to attack Jianye, then under the control of the Jin general Sima Rui the Prince of Langye, encountered difficulties as his army was trapped in the rain. Fearful that Jin forces were going to attack, Shi's key advisor Diao Ying (ÂàÅËÜ∫) suggested promising to submit to Sima Rui. Another advisor Zhang Bin disagreed, noting that Shi had dealt Jin too much damage previously to be able to submit to them. Instead, he advised Shi to retreat north‚Äînoting that Jin forces were so fearful of him that they would not likely attack‚Äîand that he should capture a defensible city to serve as headquarters so that he could start to hold and increase his territory. Under Zhang's advice, Shi, later that year, captured Xiangguo (Ë•ÑÂúã, in modern Xintai, Hebei) and made it his headquarters. He became increasingly reliant on Zhang for advice, and he respected Zhang so much that he no longer referred to him by name. = After settlement in Xiangguo = In early 313, Wang Jun (ÁéãÊµö), the Jin governor of Youzhou (modern Beijing, Tianjin, and northern Hebei), allied with the Xianbei Duan chief Duan Jilujuan (ÊÆµÁñæÈô∏Áú∑) the Duke of Liaoxi, made a major assault on Xiangguo, the defense of which had not yet been completed. Shi's general Kong Chang (Â≠îËêá), however, made a surprise attack against Duan forces, capturing Duan Jilujuan's cousin Duan Mopei (ÊÆµÊú´Êü∏). Most of Shi's generals wanted to execute Duan Mopei, but instead Shi treated Duan Mopei with courtesy and returned him to Duan forces. The Duan then withdrew and began to disassociate themselves from Wang. Subsequent to this battle, Shi began to use Xiangguo as a base of operations and gradually took increasingly larger pieces of territory under his control‚Äîstill under Han Zhao's name, but acting independently. As it became increasingly clear that Liu Cong, who was talented but violent and wasteful, had become distracted by sensual pleasures and was not able to make Han Zhao into an efficient state, Shi began to act even more independently. In early 314, Shi considered plans to destroy the still powerful Wang. Knowing that Wang long had dreams of becoming an emperor, since he believed that his name was prophesied as one for an emperor, Shi pretended to be ready to submit to him and offered him the imperial throne. Wang, trusting Shi's intentions, no longer defended against him. Several months later, Shi, under the guise of offering tribute, made a surprise attack on Wang's headquarters in Ji (Ëñä, in modern Beijing), capturing and executing Wang. (However, at this time Shi was unable to hold You Province permanently, and it fell into the hand of the Duan chief Duan Pidi (ÊÆµÂåπÁ£æ), still loyal to Jin.) In fall 315, Liu Cong officially granted Shi imperial authority in the eastern empire, formalizing Shi's hold on his domain. In early 317, Shi defeated the Jin governor of Bing Province, Liu Kun (ÂäâÁê®), who had previously posed a major threat to Han Zhao, and took Bing Province under his control, forcing Liu to flee to You Province to join Duan. In 318, Liu Cong died and was succeeded by his son Liu Can. Shortly after, however, Liu Can was killed by his father-in-law Jin Zhun in a coup, and Jin slaughtered all members of the imperial Liu household in the capital Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩ, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). Both Shi and Liu Yao, a cousin of Liu Cong, led their armies against Jin Zhun. Liu Yao declared himself emperor, and Shi decided, at that time, to submit to Liu Yao's authority. Liu Yao created him the Duke of Zhao. Subsequently, Jin Zhun, with his forces under pressure from two sides, was assassinated and succeeded by his cousin Jin Ming (Èù≥Êòé), who abandoned Pingyang and surrendered to Liu Yao. Shi entered the capital but did not occupy it. Shi Le burned palaces in Pingyang. With the capital heavily damaged by the coup and the subsequent battles, Liu Yao moved the capital to Chang'an. In early 319, Shi sent a delegation to pay tribute to Liu Yao. Liu Yao was very pleased, and made Shi the Prince of Zhao. However, subsequently, Liu Yao became suspicious that Shi was about to rebel, so killed Shi's lead delegate. Shi became angry, and later that year declared independence under the title of Prince of Zhao. (Because Liu Yao, also in 319, changed the formal name of his state from Han to Zhao, Shi's state became known as Later Zhao.)  Independence and reign as Prince of Zhao  For the first several years of his independence, Shi concentrated on annexing remaining pockets of Jin power in northern and central China. Later in 319, he attacked and defeated Duan Pidi, seizing You Province, and Duan was forced to flee to join Shao Xu (ÈÇµÁ∫å) the Jin governor of Ji Province (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, normally referring to central Hebei, but now only with control of northwestern Shandong). In 320, Shi Le sent Shi Hu and Kong Chang against Shao, capturing him. For a while longer, Duan served as the leader of the Jin forces remaining in Ji Province, but in 321, Shi Hu captured him as well. The only remaining point of Jin power north of the Yellow River became the Xianbei chief Murong Hui the Duke of Liaodong, who claimed Jin vassal status but was acting fairly independently in controlling the modern Liaoning. Shi, however, reached a stalemate to the south with the Jin governor of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, modern eastern Henan and northwestern Anhui) Zu Ti, and eventually the sides reached an informal d√©tente with the Yellow River serving as the border, leading to peace and trade relations. After Zu's death in 321, however, Later Zhao forces began to again attack Jin, gradually capturing Jin territory between the Yellow River and the Huai River. In 322, Zhang Bin died‚Äîand Shi lamented at the time that Zhang's death might prevent him from completing greater things. In 323, Shi Hu attacked Cao Ni (ÊõπÂ∂∑) -- a general occupying modern Shandong who vacillated between being a Jin vassal and a Han Zhao vassal but acting independently‚Äîcapturing him and annexing his domain into Later Zhao control. In 324, Later Zhao and Han Zhao began actively engaging each other, and for the next several years, they would wage war against each other bitterly, fighting over both their border territory and the parts of territory near the Yellow River still under Jin control. In 325, Shi Hu would defeat the Han Zhao general Liu Yue (ÂäâÂ≤≥), seizing the entire Luoyang region, which had previously been under split Jin and Han Zhao control, for Later Zhao. In 328, however, Han Zhao fought back, and forces under Liu Yao's personal command defeated Shi Hu's forces and surrounded Luoyang. Shi Le personally led his force to aid Luoyang, engaging Liu Yao in battle and capturing him. He initially treated Liu Yao with some respect and ordered Liu Yao to order his crown prince Liu Xi to surrender, but when Liu Yao refused, Shi executed him. Liu Xi, in fear of Later Zhao forces, abandoned the Han Zhao capital Chang'an and retreated to Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu) with his brother Liu Yin. In fall 328, Liu Yin tried to lead Han Zhao forces to recapture Chang'an, but Shi Hu defeated him, and subsequently marched on Shanggui, capturing it and killing Liu Xi, Liu Yin, and the other Han Zhao nobles, ending Han Zhao. The former Han Zhao territory became Later Zhao possessions.  As emperor  In 330, Shi Le assumed the title \\"Heavenly King\\" (Tian Wang) and made his wife Lady Liu the queen and his son Shi Hong the crown prince; he granted another son, Shi Hong (Áü≥ÂÆè, note different character) the Prince of Qin the title \\"Grand Chanyu,\\" as official leader of the five nomadic tribes (collectively called in Ch. Wu Hu) under his rule. This drew secret ire from Shi Hu, who felt that as the general who contributed the most to Shi Le's campaign successes, he should have been the crown prince or at least Grand Chanyu and was not satisfied with his title as the Prince of Zhongshan. Later that year, Shi assumed the title of emperor and made Princess Liu the empress. Shi Le, not realizing Shi Hu's intentions, still trusted Shi Hu greatly, despite warnings from his advisors Cheng Xia (Á®ãÈÅê) (the brother of Crown Prince Hong's mother Consort Cheng) and Xu Guang (ÂæêÂÖâ), who advised him to gradually strip Shi Hu's powers and transfer them to Shi Hong. In 332, Shi Le did transfer some of Shi Hu's authority to Shi Hong and the eunuch Yan Zhen (Âö¥Èúá), but this only served to aggravate Shi Hu. In 333, Shi Le grew ill, and Shi Hu, during Shi Le's illness, began to put his sons in command of armies, preparing for a coup. When Shi Le died in the fall, Shi Hu immediately seized power in a coup, killing Cheng and Xu. Apparently pursuant to Shi Le's directions, he was secretly buried at a location unknown publicly, and an empty casket was instead buried in a grand ceremony at an imperial tomb. Shi Hu made Shi Hong take the throne, but would depose Shi Hong in 334 and seize the throne himself. Shi Le's descendants would all die at Shi Hu's hands.

It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean. This species is found in the aquarium trade. Description The belted sandfish has a laterally compressed elongate body with a relatively short, pointed snout. It has 3 clearly visible spines on the gill cover, the middle spine being straight. The margins of the preopercle are serrated. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 12-14 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The caudal fin is truncate. The head and body are reddish-brown in colour marked with lines created by a dark spot on the scales on the body. A dark stripe runs through the eye and reaches back to anterior part of the body. The posterior part of the body has 4 dark bars that run onto the dorsal fin, with the most forward bar being the most obvious and this bar extends onto the anterior of the soft rayes part of the dorsal as an obvious black blotch. There is a clear white bar in the middle of the lower part of the body situated immediately in front of the most forward dark bar. There are wavy dark bars on the dorsal, anal and caudal fins and, in some fish, there is a pair of large black blotches at the base of the caudal fin. The pelvic fins are black with white leading edges. The belted sandfish attains a maximum recorded tital length of . Distribution The belted sandfish is found in the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends north as far as North Carolina and from there it is found south along the eastern coast of the United States and into the Gulf of Mexico, where its range extends from northwestern Cuba and the Florida Keys north and west along the Gulf coast to the border between the United States and Mexico and along the coast of Mexico from Veracruz and Madagascar Reef on the Campeche Banks, and in the Caribbean Sea along the southern coast of Cuba. Habitat and biology The belted sand fish is found silty waters where there is a substrate of mixed rubble and sand, often near jetties, rocky outcrops and artificial reefs. It can be found from the water's edge down to . It is a predatory species, the smaller fish, less than in total length, eat small crustaceans such as amphipods, gammarids and shrimp while the larger fish also ate amphipods but preyed on crabs, fishes and shrimp too. They are solitary fish which hunt close to the substrate, typically as the sun goes down. They capture prey by drawing it into their large mouth by creating a powerful suction as the mouth opensand then swallowing it whole. The belted sandfish is a synchronous hermaphrodite, i.e. the fish have both male and female functional gonads and self fertilisation is, at least, theoretically possible. This fish demonstrates three different types of mating strategy. Some fish behave as female, others are called streaker males and have an opportunistic strategy while courting males behave like males in gonochristic species. Fish with lengths of less then are most commonly females while fish larger than that breed more often as courting males. The opportunistic streaker males tend to be smaller but can be of any size. Taxonomy The belted sandfish was first formally described as Centropristis subligarius in 1870 by the American paleontologist and zoologist Edward Drinker Cope (1840-1897) with the type locality given as Pensacola in Florida. Utilisation The belted sandfish is found in the aquarium trade.

Origins Little is known of the Musunuri family; they are often described as \\"obscure\\". The founding ruler of the family, Musunuri Prolaya Nayaka, suddenly appears as a new ruler at Rekapalle, near Bhadrachalam, around 1330, claiming heritage from the Kakatiyas. Andhra historians often state that Musunuri Nayaks belonged to the Kamma caste group . However, the modern castes of Andhra region did not originate until the late stages of the Vijayanagara Empire. Opposition to Muslim Invasion After the fall of the Kakatiyas, their empire was annexed by the Delhi Sultanate. Ulugh Khan (also known as Muhammad bin Tughluq), the general that conquered Warangal, renamed it \\"Sultanpur\\" and remained as the governor of the region for a short period. In 1324, he was recalled to Delhi to succeed the Khaljis as Muhammad bin Tughluq. A former Kakatiya commander, Nagaya Ganna Vibhudu, now renamed Malik Maqbul, was appointed as the governor of the region. However, the Tughluq hold over the erstwhile Kakatiya empire was tenuous and a number of local chieftains seized effective power. Prolaya Nayaka According to the Vilasa grant, Prolaya Nayaka ruled from Rekapalle. Located at the edge of the Papikondalu hills (part of the Eastern Ghats), Rekapalle could control the narrow Sabari river valley lying between the Bhadrachalam forest and the Papikondalu forest. Konda Reddis, who populate the hill forests would have facilitated Prolaya Nayakas' rebellion against the Sultanate. Rekapalle is also a strategic location to control or obstruct communications on the Godavari river passing through the hills. Prolaya Vema Reddi of the Panta Reddi clan, who seems to have established his own independent rule in Addanki by 1325, is believed to have taken control of the region between the Krishna and Godavari rivers, perhaps up to Rajahmundry. Historian M. Rama Rao states that Vema Reddi and Prolaya Nayaka must have made a 'joint effort' to drive the Muslim rule out from the area. In 1330, Prolaya Nayaka published the Vilasa grant, a copper-plate grant near Pithapuram, in which he bemoaned the devastation of the Telugu country brought about by northern Muslim armies and attempted to legitimise himself as the rightful restorer of order.; ; Prolaya Nayaka left no children and was succeeded by a cousin, Kapaya Nayaka, who governed until 1368 and attempted to further expand his rule. Kapaya Nayaka =Rebellion= Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka (r. 1333‚Äì1368) led a larger rebellion against the Tughluq rule, driving it out of Warangal in 1336. According to the Kaluvacheru grant of Anithalli, a female member of the Panta Reddi clan in 1423, Kapaya Nayaka was assisted by 75 Nayakas. The grant also states that Prolaya Vema Reddi was one among these 75 Nayakas, but this is doubtful. Muhammad bin Tughluq, who became the Sultan of Delhi in 1324, witnessed numerous rebellions starting in 1330, first in the immediate vicinity in the Ganga-Yamuna doab, which caused a famine in Delhi, and rebellions within ranks in Ma'bar (Madurai) and Bengal. It is possible that Kapaya Nayaka advanced in the direction of Warangal in this period, acquiring some of its territory. Consequently, Telangana was also counted among the rebellious territories. In 1334‚Äì35, the Sultan marched on Deccan in an attempt to quell the rebellions, but his army was struck by some kind of epidemic and the Sultan himself fell gravely ill. He was forced to retreat to Delhi via Daulatabad. It is said that about a third of his army perished due to the epidemic. Ferishta narrates that, around this time, Kapaya Nayaka approached the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III for assistance in evicting the Sultanate from Warangal. After consideration, assistance was offered. Historian R. C. Majumdar characterises it as a 'national revolt' backed up by a regular army. Malik Maqbul found himself unable to withstand the rebellion and fled to Delhi. Ferishta states that Kapaya Nayaka and Ballala III then jointly marched on the newly declared Madurai Sultanate and divested it of its outlying territories, in particular Tondaimandalam. =Rule= Kapaya Nayaka took control of Warangal from Malik Maqbul in 1336 and thus also of a wider swathe of eastern Telangana that was governed from there. He also tried to support other rebels in the surrounding areas, although in the case of aid given to Alauddin Bahman Shah, the outcome was that his fellow rebel turned on him. Several military engagements with Bahaman Shah followed over a period of years, during which Kapaya Nayaka had to cede various forts and territories. His weakened position was exploited by the Reddis of Kondavidu and the Recherla Nayaks, the latter of whom killed him in battle at Bhimavaram. Despite his supposed opposition to the Dehlavi Sultans, Kapaya Nayaka continued using the Kush Mahal built by the Sultans in Warangal and adopted the Persianised title \\"Sultan of the Andhra country\\" (Andhra Suratrana). In 1361, he gifted to the Bahmani Sultan Mohammed Shah I the turquoise throne of Warangal, made during the Delhi rule, as part of a treaty agreement. Kapaya Nayaka ruled over Telangana until 1368. Upon his death, the allied Nayakas are said to have returned to their own towns, and the period of Musunuri family ended.

The band plays melodic but hard-hitting punk rock that borrows heavily from early-1980s hardcore bands such as Black Flag. History =Founding and first album= In 2002, Russ Rankin found himself ill-at-ease with the situation of his other band Good Riddance. The band did not play frequently, and Rankin wanted to tour more. He set out to form another band that would be more active and that would pursue his drug/alcohol-free aesthetics and lifestyle. When Russ was in the Blasting Room with Good Riddance to record Bound By Ties of Blood and Affection, he asked producer Bill Stevenson ‚Äì legendary drummer of seminal punk bands Black Flag, Descendents, and All ‚Äì to be the drummer in his new project. The band recorded a five-song demo in 2003, which they sent out to labels. In the February 2004, the band worked on new material and recording more demos to send to prospective labels. They played their first show on February 15, 2004 at the Starlight in Ft. Collins, CO. They were signed to Fat Wreck Chords by April 2004. They played some shows with Dropkick Murphys in April and May, and played on some Warped Tour dates that summer. Their debut album, To the Nines, was released in July 2004. =Second album and line-up changes= On January 23, 2007, Only Crime released their second album, Virulence, on Fat Wreck Chords, followed by a Split EP with Outbreak, released June 26, 2007 on Think Fast! Records. In February 2007, Zach Blair had joined Rise Against. Shortly after, it was announced he was no longer in Only Crime and was replaced by Modern Life Is War guitarist Matt Hoffman. Bassist Doni Blair played his last show with the band on August 15, 2007 in Kansas City, before leaving to spend more time with his family and pursue his instrumental project, the Mag Seven (also with Bill Stevenson). He was temporarily replaced by Zack Busby (Burden Brothers), and then permanently replaced by Dan Kelly (The Frisk). Doni Blair has been the bassist for The Toadies since 2008. =Third album= The band started working on their third album in 2009, but the band ended up getting put on hold for a while due to Stevenson being sick. In April 2013, Rankin claimed that their third album had been finished and that it would be released in 2013. In March 2014, it was announced that the album would finally be released. Titled Pursuance, it was released by Rise Records on May 13, 2014.

A pleading in the alternative sets forth multiple claims or defenses either hypothetically or alternatively, such that if one of the claims or defenses are held invalid or insufficient, the other claims or defenses should still have to be answered.  Description  One example, submitting an injury complaint alleging that the harm to the plaintiff caused by the defendant was so outrageous that it must have either been intended as a malicious attack or, if not, must have been due to gross negligence. At a late 1970s American Bar Association seminar in New York, Richard \\"Racehorse\\" Haynes gave this example: \\"Say you sue me because you say my dog bit you. Well, now this is my defense: My dog doesn't bite. And second, in the alternative, my dog was tied up that night. And third, I don't believe you really got bit. And fourth, I don't have a dog.\\" Normally such arguments would seem to cancel each other on their face, however, legally \\"even if\\" and \\"anyway\\" clauses need not be argued; mutually exclusive defenses can be advanced without excuses for their relationship to each other. Of course jurists might be influenced by dual defenses such as \\"my dog was tied up\\" and \\"I don't have a dog\\", but this must be weighed against the fact that defenses may not be allowed if they are introduced too late. When alternative pleading is logically inconsistent, it constitutes kettle logic.  Civil law  The United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure state that a \\"party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically, either in one count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them if made independently would be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency and whether based on legal, equitable, or maritime grounds.\\" This has been explained as being intended to accommodate \\"alternative theories\\" in cases where \\"the exact nature of the facts is in doubt\\" or the pleading party \\"does not know which of the alternatives is true or can be established by the evidence.\\" However, this does not mean inconsistent statements can be given for facts within a party's knowledge. In New Jersey, pleading inconsistent facts in the alternative may not be used as an admission against that party. = Jury verdicts = In a criminal case, when a prosecutor puts forth alternative facts which are inconsistent with each other, the inconsistency may present confusion to the jury during deliberation of the verdict in term of the requirements of being unanimous. For example, the Constitution of Oregon requires that the guilty verdict of a first-degree murder must be unanimous. In State v. Zweigart, 344 Or. 619 (Or. 2008), the Oregon Supreme Court held that \\"a jury must agree, not only that a defendant is guilty of a crime, but also on all the facts material to prove the crime.\\" This means the jury would not be allowed to have half of the jurors using one set of facts and the other half using another even if all of them agree that the defendant is guilty. = Non-U.S. law = In the courts of England and Wales, under the Civil Procedure Rules (CPR), a party is required to sign a statement of truth to verify facts in the case.https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part22 Citing the CPR, a trial court rejected an amendment giving a new version of the pleading that was contradictory to the original. However, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales disagreed and found that the purpose of Part 22 of the CPR is not to \\"exclude the possibility of pleading inconsistent factual alternatives\\".  Criminal law  Because pleading in the alternative is generally permitted in criminal cases, a defendant may claim to have not committed the crime itself, but at the same time may claim that if the defendant had committed the crime, the act was excused for a reason such as insanity or intoxication, or was justified due to provocation or self defense. However, a jury will naturally be suspicious if a defendant claims the benefits of, for example, both alibi and self defense.

Known for its winter tyres, Nokian is the only tyre manufacturer with its own permanent winter tyre testing facility in the world. The company's Hakkapeliitta brand name is recognised in Finland as a reputable trademark. Nokian Tyres concentrates on the consumer car and vehicle tyre replacement and premium snow tyre markets; they do not supply automobile manufacturers tyres for new car production. The greater prices consistently found in those markets result in higher profitability compared to the rest of the tyre industry. The company also produces retreading materials and tyre pressure monitors. It also previously manufactured bicycle tyres but currently licenses the Nokian name on bicycles tyres to another Finnish company. The Vianor retail tyre store chain, which services cars in addition to selling tyres, is owned by Nokian Tyres PLC. The company traces its history to a groundwood pulp mill established in 1865. Car tyre production began in 1932 by Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd). A three-company merger formed the Nokia Corporation in 1967; Nokian Tyres Limited was established in 1988 as a joint venture company split from the conglomerate as Nokia Corporation started focusing entirely on the mobile communications business. Nokian is \\"Nokia\\" in the genitive, thus Nokian renkaat meaning \\"Tyres of Nokia\\". The European subsidiary of Japanese tyre company Bridgestone is currently the largest minority shareholder. History The brand logo of Finnish Rubber Works between 1965‚àí1966 Nokia municipality, Finland Early corporate predecessors of Nokian Tyres are the Nokia Aktiebolag (Nokia Company) and Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd.). In 1865, mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a groundwood pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland. In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta River, which had better resources for hydroelectric production. In 1871, with the help of his close friend, the statesman Leo Mechelin, Idestam renamed and transformed his mills into a share company, founding the Nokia Company. Suomen Gummitehdas Oy was founded in 1898 and began manufacturing car tyres in 1932. The Hakkapeliitta tyre name was introduced in 1936, and some tyres sold under the Nokian tyre name still use the Hakkapeliitta brand name. Hakkapeliitta is a (Finnish) historical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman in the service of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48). In 1967, Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (originally called Suomen Gummitehdas Oy, Finnish Rubber Works in English) merged with Kaapelitehdas (The Cable Company) and the forest and power industry company Nokia Aktiebolag to create Nokia Corporation. Nokian Tyres (which had manufactured tyres under the Nokia brand; Nokian is the genitive) was split from the Nokia Corporation when Nokian Tyres Limited was created in 1988 as a joint venture company. Nokian Tyres PLC shares were floated on the Helsinki Stock Exchange (OMX Helsinki) in 1995. Nokia, which became the largest mobile telephone manufacturer in 1998, ended its ownership interest in Nokian Tyres in 2003, selling its holding of 2 million shares to Bridgestone Europe NV/SA, a subsidiary of the Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone, for U.S. $73.2 million. This made Bridgestone the largest shareholder, with an 18.9% stake, later diluted to 16.8%. Bridgestone announced that Nokian Tyres would be operated independently, but it would consider complementing the company's product development, testing, and distribution. Production of bicycle tyres and inner tubes started in 1974 in Lieksa, Finland. In 2004, Nokian Tyres sold its bicycle tyre business to Suomen Rengastehdas Oy for ‚Ç¨3.6 million. This successor company remains one of the few manufacturers of tungsten carbide-studded snow tyres for bicycles. Suomen Rengastehdas continues to produce bicycle tyres, including all Nokian-branded bicycle tyres. Nokian Tyres set up a joint venture, Ordabasy ‚Äì Nokian Tyres JSC, with Ordabasy Corporation JSC, a multi-industry Kazakh company, to manufacture passenger car tyres at a planned new factory in Kazakhstan. The venture started in 2007, but the manufacturing project was put on hold in early 2009.Company statement on occasion of publication of 2008 Annual Report. Nokian Tyres was to provide technical expertise in tyre manufacturing, and the products were to be sold in Kazakhstan, Central Asia, Russia, and Eastern Europe. In 2009, the Nokian Hakkapeliitta tyre model line received the \\"List of trademarks with a reputation\\" status by the National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland. Financial information Nokian Tyres' three principal activities are the manufacture of passenger car tyres, heavy commercial tyres, and retail tyre sales. As of 2008, Nokian is the most profitable tyre manufacturer in the world, at up to 18% earnings (before taxes and interest) relative to sales, compared to 14% at Bridgestone, 8% at Michelin, and 9.6% at Continental. In 2010, Nokian Tyres profits were ‚Ç¨167.9 million on sales of ‚Ç¨1.058 billion, an increase in revenues of 32.5% on the previous year. The company had revenue growth of 18% annually in the 2003‚Äì2007 period. Nokian Tyres is also publicly traded on the Berlin Stock Exchange. Kim Gran has been the President and Chief Executive Officer since 1 September 2000, having previously served as a vice president for five years.

SR 30 runs east-west through Hanover and Caroline Counties, connecting US 1 and I-95 with Kings Dominion and US 301. The state highway serves as the principal highway of King William County, connecting U.S. Route 360 with SR 33 in West Point via the county's namesake county seat. SR 30 also connects SR 33 and US 60 in New Kent and James City Counties. Route description View west along SR 30 near SR 620 in King William County SR 30 begins at an intersection with US 1 (Washington Highway) south of Doswell in northeastern Hanover County. The state highway heads east as Kings Dominion Boulevard, a two-lane road that heads east and crosses over CSX's RF&P; Subdivision on a very wide bridge. Just east of the railroad crossing, SR 30 meets I-95 at a partial cloverleaf interchange Immediately to the east of the railroad crossing, SR 30 intersects SR 725 (Binns Road), which leads to the ramp from southbound I-95 to Kings Dominion. SR 30 continues east to its interchange with I-95, which includes direct ramps between southbound I-95 and the entrance to Kings Dominion. Access to the ramp from SR 30 is provided indirectly from SR 725 (Binns Road) between the railroad crossing and the interchange. At I-95, SR 30 expands to a four-lane divided highway. East of I-95, SR 30 passes between a truck stop and the parking lot of Kings Dominion, which is accessed by either Theme Park Way or the direct entrance immediately to the east. SR 30 crosses CSX's Piedmont Subdivision at grade before crossing the North Anna River into Caroline County. Just east of the river, the state highway, now known as Dawn Boulevard, passes through the hamlet of Hart Corner, which contains Meadow Event Park, the home of the Virginia State Fair starting in 2009. East of the event park, SR 30 reduces to a two-lane highway and continues east to Bowersville, also known as Dawn, where the highway intersects US 301 and SR 2 (Richmond Turnpike). SR 30 continues east into King William County, where the highway is named King William Road. The state highway passes through the hamlets of Calno, Mangohick (the site of Mangohick Church), Epworth, Pollards Corner, and Turpin before reaching its intersection with US 360 (Richmond Tappahannock Highway) in the village of Central Garage. SR 30 continues southeast through Rumford to the unincorporated county seat of King William. The King William County Courthouse, which was constructed in 1725, is the oldest continually used courthouse building in the United States. The state highway continues southeast through the hamlet of Romancoke to the town of West Point, which is located at the southeastern end of King William County where the Pamukey and Mattaponi Rivers merge to form the York River. SR 30 turns west onto four-lane 14th Street to join SR 33 in a concurrency. The two state highways cross the Eltham Bridge over the Pamunkey River into New Kent County. SR 30 and SR 33 head west as four-lane Eltham Road through the village of Eltham, where the highway meets the northern terminus of SR 273 (Farmers Drive), which was formerly part of SR 30. West of the village, the two highways widen to a divided highway west until the concurrency ends at New Kent Highway, which heads west as SR 249 and southeast as SR 30. SR 30 meets the southern end of SR 273 (Farmers Drive) in Barhamsville, then enters James City County. A short distance south of the county line, the state highway, now named Old Stage Road, expands to a four-lane divided highway and meets I-64 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. SR 30 continues south as Barhamsville Road to its intersection with US 60 (Richmond Highway) north of Toano. SR 30 is marked to the north and east legs of the intersection and US 60 is assigned to the south and west legs of the intersection, meaning staying on the same highway requires making a turn. SR 30 heads east as Rochambeau Drive, which is a four-lane divided highway until reducing to two lanes shortly before reaching an intersection with SR 607 (Croaker Road) and SR 755 (Rochambeau Drive) north of Norge. SR 30 turns north onto Croaker Road, a four-lane divided highway, and passes through a full cloverleaf interchange with I-64.

The audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern. It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy. Slogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling. Examples include the Three Little Pigs, Three Billy Goats Gruff, and the Three Musketeers. Similarly, adjectives are often grouped in threes to emphasize an idea. The Latin phrase \\"omne trium perfectum\\" (everything that comes in threes is perfect, or, every set of three is complete) conveys the same idea as the rule of three.  Meaning  The rule of three can refer to a collection of three words, phrases, sentences, lines, paragraphs/stanzas, chapters/sections of writing and even whole books. The three elements together are known as a triad. The technique may be used not just in prose but poetry, oral storytelling, films and advertising. In photography, the rule of thirds produces a similar effect by dividing an image into three vertically and horizontally. A tricolon is a more specific use of the rule of three where three words or phrases are equal in length and grammatical form. A hendiatris is a figure of speech where three successive words are used to express a single central idea. As a slogan or motto, this is known as a tripartite motto.  Slogans and catchphrases  Many advertising campaigns and public information slogans use the technique to create a catchy, memorable way of displaying information. In marketing theory, American advertising and sales pioneer St. Elmo Lewis laid out his three chief copywriting principles, which he felt were crucial for effective advertising: > The mission of an advertisement is to attract a reader so that he will look > at the advertisement and start to read it; then to interest him, so that he > will continue to read it; then to convince him, so that when he has read it > he will believe it. If an advertisement contains these three qualities of > success, it is a successful advertisement. Better-known examples include: * Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness ‚Äì Rights outlined in the U.S. Declaration of Independence * Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√© ‚Äì The slogan of the French Republic predating 1790 * Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit ‚Äì Opening line of German National Anthem * A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play ‚Äì Mars advertising slogan since 1959 * Stop, Look and Listen ‚Äì A public road and level crossing safety slogan * Stop, Drop and Roll ‚Äì A fire safety slogan listing the steps to take if one's clothing has caught fire * Faster, Higher, Stronger ‚Äì The Olympic motto; a translation of the Latin Citius, Altius, Fortius * Veni, vidi, vici ‚Äì A triad translated from Latin as \\"I came, I saw, I conquered\\", popularly attributed to Julius Caesar of Rome. * Slip-Slop-Slap ‚Äì Australian sun protection (anti-skin- cancer) campaign. * Stay Alert, Control the Virus, Save Lives - UK government slogan during the 2020 pandemic. * Hands, Face, Space ‚Äì A second UK government slogan during the 2020 pandemic. Comedy In comedy, it is also called a comic triple, and is one of the many comedic devices regularly used by humorists, writers, and comedians. The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience, and is frequently the punch line of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals‚Äîsuch as an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead‚Äîwhere the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character. The comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from The Dick Van Dyke Show - \\"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\\". Just like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed. Storytelling and folklore In storytelling, authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely beginning, middle, and end, from Aristotle's Poetics. Syd Field wrote a popular handbook of screenwriting, in which he touted the advantages of three-act structure over the more traditional five- act structure used by William Shakespeare and many other famous playwrights. Snow White receives three visits from her wicked stepmother. Vladimir Propp, in his Morphology of the Folk Tale, concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice.Propp, Vladimir. Morphology of the Folk Tale. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout folk tales and fairy tales: most commonly, perhaps, in that the youngest son is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes: * Rumpelstiltskin spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days. * In East of the Sun and West of the Moon, the heroine receives three gifts while searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is held prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep). * In Brother and Sister, Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time. * In The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird, a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title. * In The Silent Princess, a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice. * In The Love for Three Oranges, the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it. Literature * In Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, Marley's Ghost tells Ebenezer Scrooge he will receive visits from three spirits: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present, and finally The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, to which Scrooge says, \\"Spirit, I fear you most of all.\\" * In the musical Fiddler on the Roof, Tevye must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \\"on the other hand\\" to play the devil's advocate and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a Gentile, for which Tevye concludes that \\"No, there is no other hand.\\" * In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Mark Antony starts his speech by using the rule of three: Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears, to which the commoners start to listen. Rhetoric and public speaking Cassandre's advertisement for Dubonnet aperitif uses wordplay and a progression of three items.alt=French: Dubo, Dubon, Dubonnet. Vin tonique au quinquina. The use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled Our Masters' Voices,Atkinson, J. Maxwell. Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics. London: Methuen, 1984. gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause. Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \\"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \\"insult, injustice and exploitation\\", followed a few lines later by \\"justice, good will, and brotherhood\\". Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor George Wallace inveighed: \\"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\\" during his 1963 inaugural address. The appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of Winston Churchill's reference to \\"blood, toil, tears and sweat\\" (echoing Garibaldi and Theodore Roosevelt) in popular recollection to \\"blood, sweat and tears\\". Similarly, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan describes the importance of community, without which life would be \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\\". This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad \\"nasty, brutish and short\\". The Welsh Triads and Irish Triads suggest the use of threes was also a mnemonic device‚Äîeasy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids. Law A common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate. For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase \\"I give, devise and bequeath ...\\" Usually (in court) a common example is quoted: \\"tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

Located in the borough of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, United States, the school has approximately 950 students in grades seven through twelve. WAHS has been included in Newsweeks list of top 1,200 public high schools in the United States annually since 2006.America's Top Public High Schools  Newsweek Best High Schools  Newsweek.com The Washington Post named WAHS the most challenging public school in the state, excluding magnet and charter schools,https://apps.washingtonpost.com/local/highschoolchallenge/schools/2014/list/pennsylvania- schools/ and U.S. News & World Report ranked it as the best public school in the state, also excluding magnet and charter schools.https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/pennsylvania/rankings?int=c0b4c1 History In 1909, the Wyomissing school district was founded, with classes being taught in a private residence. In 1908, the district's first building was completed on Belmont Avenue and served grades 1-11 until 1922 (seniors attended another area high school). It served grades 1-6 until 1939. This building is now the Wyomissing Institute of Fine Arts. The first dedicated high school building was constructed in 1923 on Wyomissing Boulevard. This building remained the high school until 1939, when it became the elementary school and the high school moved to Evans Avenue. The current high school was constructed in 1940, as part of Franklin Roosevelt's depression recovery program, the Works Projects Administration. The building was expanded to meet the growing student body in 1965, and was renovated in 1994. The Wyomissing School District became the Wyomissing Area School District upon merging with the former West Reading School District in the late 1960s. In 1984, the original high school, which was built in 1923, was destroyed and the land was sold for housing. An addition was finished in September 2006. This added several new classrooms, a new chorus room, and a stagecraft workshop. The somewhat controversial renovation removed two courtyards in the school, many windows in classrooms, and a major portion of the student parking area. The school's auditorium was also recently renovated. This included removing the windows, replacing the seats, installing new curtains and carpeting, repainting, and installing garage doors in the stage right wing and the new set construction rooms so that scenery could be moved.

Family-friendly restaurants are ones that provide service to families that have young children. Frequently, family- friendly products avoid marketing solely to children and attempt to make the product palatable to adults as well. Politics In politics, new workplace legislation may be introduced to strengthen the family unit through giving parents more flexible family-friendly working hours or educational reforms to helping children with special needs and to give parents more choice in how they are schooled. Hospitality industry The concept of family-friendliness within the tourism sector is constantly evolving. Hotels concentrate new services towards family-friendliness in a narrower concept such as child- (kids stay and eat free) and pet-friendliness (pet friendly hotel chains) within the overall family-friendliness customer oriented concept. Media The precise definition of \\"family-friendly\\" can vary depending upon the perceived acceptability of content for children ‚Äî one of the most challenged books in United States libraries is Captain Underpants, a book that contains toilet humor that parents read out to children. Consumer advocacy groups representing parents have lobbied against media that contains profanity and criticized what they see as attempts to deny other families the ability to choose what is appropriate for their children. In December 2019 a broad coalition of US consumer groups, including the CDC and the CCFC, called for the Federal Trade Commission to carry out a sweeping review of digital media companies that target children. The values of the individual family, such as their belief in religion, can also affect whether the family perceives a product as family-friendly. Both the MPAA film rating system and most television content rating systems have ratings for family-friendliness: a G rating in either is universally acceptable for all audiences, while a PG rating suggests that, while generally safe for children to watch, that there should be a parent or guardian present for guidance, since some mild adult- oriented material may be present. The MPAA's film rating system has not been without controversy (itself established after the Hays Code, which required all films to be at least somewhat family-friendly, was abolished), as theater chain interest groups have noted that films rated as high as R (adult-oriented films that persons under 17 cannot watch without an adult) could be interpreted as being family-friendly if the viewer is tolerant of profanity, while others may have far too much graphic violence or borderline-pornographic sexual images to be suitable for children. The North American Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rates video games, classifies family-friendly content with an E rating. Events A family-friendly (or all-ages) show, event or venue refers to one with no age restrictions for entry. In the United States, as applied to the world of concerts, this can refer to a show or venue where minors are permitted to attend a live performance, since those who are not of legal drinking age are generally not permitted in bars, but are permitted in restaurants which serve alcoholic beverages. In some cases the pop-up retail model is applied, as with the pop-up venues at the Treefort Music Fest. More ideologically, following the trends of punk rock and embracing to an extent the opposition to drugs and alcohol inherent in the Straight-edge movement, All Ages shows have either no alcohol sales whatsoever, or sales are restricted through a system of wristbands or for patrons legally prohibited from consuming alcohol, generally as a large, black, \\"X\\" on the back of each hand. This symbol has been featured on many punk album covers, and the attendant term, \\"All Ages,\\" was used as the title of a compilation album by North American punk icons Bad Religion. The term in this context does not denote a restriction on the thematic or lyrical content of the music.

The treaty was signed on 21 February 1999, at the conclusion of a historic summit in Lahore, and ratified by the parliaments of both countries the same year.The Lahore Declaration Under the terms of the treaty, a mutual understanding was reached towards the development of atomic arsenals and to avoid accidental and unauthorised operational use of nuclear weapons. The Lahore Declaration brought added responsibility to both nations' leadership towards avoiding nuclear race, as well as both non-conventional and conventional conflicts. This event was significant in the history of Pakistan and it provided both countries an environment of mutual confidence. In a much- covered televised press conference in both countries, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee signed the treaty. It was the second nuclear control treaty signed by both countries and pledged to continue the use of the first treaty, NNAA, was signed in 1988. The Lahore treaty was quickly ratified by the parliaments of India and Pakistan and came into force the same year. The Lahore Declaration signalled a major breakthrough in overcoming the historically strained bilateral relations between the two nations in the aftermath of the publicly performed atomic tests carried out by both nations in May 1998. Widely popular in the public circles in Pakistan and hailed by the international community, the relations would soon lose impetus with the outbreak of the controversial Kargil debacle in May 1999. Overview The Lahore treaty was one of the most important and historical treaties of India and Pakistan to normalise the relations to ease up the military tensions in South Asia. In 1972, the Shimla Treaty was acceded to establish peaceful relations in the aftermath of the war in 1971 and committed both nations to resolving bilateral disputes by peaceful dialogue and co- operation. In 1978, Pakistan made a proposal to limit the nuclear race between two countries and to establish South Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone (SANWFZ), for which negotiations were never concluded. In 1988, Pakistan and India reached an important understanding towards controlling the nuclear weapons, and signed the NNAA treaty. Despite many proposals, the nuclear race continued and the cold war had been heightened over the issue of Kashmir. The domestic pressure and the increasingly political momentum, India conducted the nuclear tests (see: Operation Shakti) in May 1998, in spite of international pressure. Responding to India's test, Pakistan equalised the nuclear magnitude in South Asia after performing its own series of atomic tests, (see: Chagai-I), all in the end month of May 1998.Shakti tests The tests invited condemnation and economic sanctions on both countries and many fear in the international community that in a wake of intensified conflict, it could lead to nuclear war. =Negotiations= In 1998, the Foreign ministries of both countries had been initiating peace process to ease up the tension in the region. On 23 September 1998 both governments signed an agreement recognising the principle of building an environment of peace and security and resolving all bilateral conflicts, which became the basis of the Lahore Declaration. On 11 February 1999, the Pakistan Foreign Office announced the state visit of Indian Prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee aboard the maiden bus service between the two countries. Before the arrival of Indian Prime Minister, a warm welcome awaited Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee when he arrived at Wagah by the inaugural bus service between New Delhi and Lahore. He was received by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the units of Pakistan Army gave the Indian Prime minister a guard of honour. It embarked on a historic visit to Pakistan, travelling on the inaugural bus service connecting the Indian capital of New Delhi with the major Pakistani city of Lahore, establishing a major transport link for the peoples of both nations. The inaugural bus also carried Indian celebrities and dignitaries such as Dev Anand, Satish Gujral, Javed Akhtar, Kuldip Nayar, Kapil Dev, Shatrughan Sinha and Mallika Sarabhai.Vajpayee drives across the border into Pakistan and history He was received amidst great fanfare and media attention at the Pakistani border post of Wagah by Pakistan Prime minister Nawaz Sharif, with whom he had been at loggerheads a year before over the nuclear tests controversy. The summit was hailed worldwide as a major breakthrough and milestone in bilateral relations and a historic step towards ending conflict and tensions in the region. =Drafting and Signatures= The Lahore declaration is one notable treaty after the 1988 NNAA treaty and the 1972 Shimla Treaty. After the two Prime ministers signed the agreement, the foreign secretaries of Pakistan Shamshad Ahmad and India K. Raghunath signed an MoU on 21 February 1999, identifying measures aimed at promoting an environment of peace and security between the two countries. The MOU reaffirmed the continued commitment of their respective governments to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. The MoU reiterated the determination of both countries to implementing the Simla Agreement in letter and spirit; and that an environment of peace and security is in the national interest of both countries and that resolution of all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, is essential for this purpose. The parliaments of both countries quickly ratified and acceded the treaties following the signatures. Content The Lahore Declaration was signed on 21 February along with a memorandum of understanding (MoU) after three rounds of talks between the Indian and Pakistani leaders.Vajpayee, Sharief sign Lahore Declaration In its content, both governments asserted their commitment to the vision of peace, stability and mutual progress and their full commitment to the Simla Agreement and the UN Charter. Both governments recognised through the Lahore Declaration that the development of nuclear weapons brought added responsibility to both nations towards avoiding conflict and promoted the importance of Confidence-building measures, especially to avoid accidental and unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan also decided to give each other advance notification of ballistic missile flight tests and accidental or unexplained use of nuclear weapons to avoid the outbreak of a nuclear conflict. Its important inter alia stated: **Recognizes that the nuclear dimension of the security environment of the two countries adds to their responsibility for avoidance of conflict between them. **Commits both to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, and the universally accepted principles of peaceful co-existence. **Commits both countries to the objectives of universal nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. The Lahore Declaration and the MoU incorporated a joint commitment to intensify efforts to resolve the Kashmir conflict and other dispute, to enhance bilateral dialogue and to implement nuclear safeguards and measures to prevent conflict. Both governments condemned terrorism and committed to non-interference in each other's internal affairs and the objectives of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation and promote human rights. In the joint statement issued after the conclusion of the summit, both governments said that their foreign ministers would meet periodically and consult each other on issues pertaining to the World Trade Organization and information technology. A two-member ministerial committee was to be established to investigate human rights issues, civilian detainees and missing prisoners of war. The Indian Prime Minister thanked his Pakistani counterpart and issued an invitation for a future summit in India. Public debates and Reactions =Pakistan public and media opinion= The Lahore treaty was very popular in Pakistan's civil society sphere. The general population polls were widely welcomed this move by the Nawaz Sharif Government to normalise relations with India. The news channels, television outlets, and print media widely hailed this move by the Government of Nawaz Sharif to normalise relations with India. Except JI, the far-right party was critical of this treaty; all major political forces in Pakistan, including PPP, hailed and congratulated Nawaz Sharif for successfully reaching the Lahore treaty. However, it was speculated in the Indian news media that many in Pakistan military did not approve of the treaty and consequently worked to subvert it and escalate tensions between the two nations.Tribune India The reception for Vajpayee, described as the leader of an \\"enemy-combatant nation,\\" was boycotted by the chiefs of Pakistan military, and those included the Chairman joint chiefs and army chief General Pervez Musharaff, air chief ACM PQ Mehdi and naval chief Admiral Fasih Bokhari.Pakistani military chiefs boycott welcome =Indian public and media opinion= The Lahore Declaration was hailed warmly in India and in the global media and by governments of other nations, forging optimism after the global tensions over the 1998 nuclear tests. The initiative bolstered the popularity of the Vajpayee government in India, cementing his standing as a statesman. Aftermath and status The relations between the two nations were completely transformed at the outbreak of the Kargil War in May 1999, following the sudden revelation that Pakistani soldiers had infiltrated into Indian Administered Kashmir;Kargil War; Blasting Peace Musharraf Vs. Sharif: Who's Lying? the Indian Army was deployed to evict the Pakistan army soldiers and retake capture the disputed territory. The two-month-long conflict claimed the lives of hundreds of soldiers on both sides and brought both nations close to full-scale war and possible nuclear conflict. After this conflict, the \\"Lahore Treaty\\" was stalled and no further discussions took place between the two countries on promoting the dialogue and CBMs initiated at Lahore in February 1999. The conflict was followed by an Atlantique incident in which the Indian Air Force intercept and shot down the Pakistan Navy's reconnaissance aircraft; a total of eleven naval personnel were killed. After months of contentious relations with the military and judiciary, a military coup d'√©tat was staged by Pakistan Armed Forces that overthrew the Government of Nawaz Sharif and brought the chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf, believed to be responsible for the Kargil incursion, to power, thus exacerbating doubts over the future of the relations between the two nations. Despite many political difficulties, India reiterated the necessity of implementing the Simla and Lahore treaties and said India would support the Simla Agreement, Lahore Declaration, and the issue of cross-border terrorism.

It is similar to the sheng, with multiple bamboo pipes fixed in a wind chest which may be made out of bamboo, wood, or a gourd. Each pipe contains a free reed, which is also made of bamboo. Whereas the sheng is used to provide simultaneous tones in harmony (in fourths and fifths), the yu is played in single lines melodically. The instrument was used, often in large numbers, in court orchestras of ancient China (and was also exported to Korea and Japan) but is no longer used. History Although the yu is now obsolete, it is known to most Chinese speakers through the saying \\"L√†n y√∫ ch≈çng sh√π\\" (), meaning \\"to fill a position without having the necessary qualifications.\\" The saying is derived from the story of Nanguo (ÂçóÂªì), a man who joined the royal court orchestra of King Xuan of Qi (ÂÆ£Áéã, 319 BC‚Äì300 BC), the ruler of the State of Qi (Shandong province) as a yu player. Although the man did not actually know how to play this instrument, he knew that the orchestra had no fewer than 300 yu players, so he felt secure that he could simply pretend to play, and thus collect a musician's salary. Upon the king's death, Nanguo was eventually exposed as an impostor when the king's son Min (Ê≥ØÁéã, 300 BC‚Äì283 BC), who had succeeded his father as king, requested that the musicians play individually rather than as an ensemble. On the night before he was to play, Nanguo fled the palace, never to return.

Gara Mount bounds the Sapna valley to south and Matean Mount to the north. The village lies a short distance southwest of Amadiya airport.  Etymology  The village is believed to be named after the Mar Daudo monastery which is located north of Dawodiya.  History  In 1850 there were 30 - 45 Chaldean Catholic families living in Dawodiya. By 1913 the population of the village had grown to 300 individuals. In 1961 approximately 150 families lived in the village. Some references indicate that the village of Dawodiya existed in pre-Christian times while others suggest that it was built in the Middle Ages. While residents of Dawodiya are not certain of the village's exact age, they assume it was several centuries ago when some Assyrian Christian families escaped the persecution of Ottoman authorities during their original occupation of Bohtan in southern Turkey. The village was demolished in 1987 during the Anfal campaign by the regime of Saddam Hussein. The church of the village was also destroyed along with the village during the Anfal campaign. The British scholar Austen Henry Layard visited the village in the 1840s, spending one night there. In his writings he mentions that there were 200 families living in the village, a police station and a church. Layard also notes that Catholicism replaced the original denomination of those people who were the followers of the Assyrian Church of the East.Cited in Nora Kubie, The Road to Nineveh: The Adventures and Excavations of Austen Henry Layard, Doubleday: 1964. The village has a church dedicated to St John the Baptist which was originally built in the seventeenth century but was later rebuilt due to its destruction in 1987. The Anfal genocide also led to the damage of a shrine dedicated to Mart Shmuni. In 2004 Kurds from neighbouring villages stole agricultural lands and pastures from the villagers of Dawodiya.

He was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on the retirement of the widely respected Francis Burt. In 1990 he also became Lieutenant-Governor of the state. Malcolm earned great respect during his time as Chief Justice, and received great acclaim from the legal profession on his retirement on 7 February 2006. However, during his final year on the bench he came under increasing pressure, by the media, for perceived failings on the bench after he aborted a murder trial. At his farewell, the Attorney-General, Jim McGinty, commented on the landmark judgement that Malcolm had handed down in the appeal of John Button, a high-profile case in which a manslaughter conviction was quashed over 30 years after the event. Wayne Martin replaced Malcolm as Chief Justice, and Malcolm later became Professor of Law at the University of Notre Dame Australia, Fremantle. Malcolm died in Perth in October 2014, aged 76.

It is the administrative centre of the eponymous Harmanli Municipality. As of December 2009, the town has a population of 19,734 inhabitants. Bulgarian National Statistical Institute - Population as of 31.12.2018 Near the site of Hamanli in Late Antiquity, during the early 4th-century Cibalensean War, the Battle of Mardia was fought between the Roman emperors Licinius and Constantine the Great. Harmanli was founded 1510 along the road connecting Central Europe and Anatolia. Geography Its territory spreads over some parts of the Upper Thracian Lowlands between the oblique south slopes of the Sredna Gora and precipitous north slopes of the Rhodope Mountains. The south boundary of the Thracian lowlands is outlined by the north Rhodope foot, along which it leans close on the north Rhodopes, between the lower end of the Momina Klisura defile (at 300 m elevation) and the beginning of the Harmanli defile (at 80 m elevation). The Maritsa River flows near the city. The climate of the area is temperate continental, which determines the variety of the vegetative types, some of which pertain to the evergreen groups (south of Harmanli). The soils are mainly maroon and woody. It is located 270 km from the capital Sofia History The first historical records of it date back to 1530, with the memoirs of Benedit Kuripe≈°iƒç, who would sojourn there as an interpreter in his mission. Skilful masters built a solid caravansaray on the right bank of the Harmanli river (then Oludere). In order to facilitate travelers and tradesmen, a vaulted bridge was built in 1585 by the order of the Ottoman administrator Siyavu≈ü Pasha. The marble inscription on the bridge reads as follows: \\"The world is a bridge, across which the way of the king and the poor man passes.\\" The humpbacked bridge has been saved almost intact to this day. Culture The location of the town along the roadway gives reason to a writer Gencho Stoev to say that: \\"Harmanli does not need to travel because the world goes through it\\". A historic fountain was built in the place called White-legged Girl's Spring (Turkish: Ak baldƒ±r √ße≈ümesi), half an hour way from the bridge. The legend about Guergana was celebrated in a poem by Petko Slaveikov. Another legend revolves about the story of boyar Valkashin or Vukasin, father of the legendary Krali Marko, who was killed near this spring fighting the Ottoman sultan Murad. A cultural centre (chitalishte) in Harmanli. =Tourist attractions= The municipality area has a number of waterfalls in the areas of Kyumyurluka and Kuru Dere and the protected area of Defileto, as well as the historic spots the Karakolyuvata Kashta Cave, Hades Forest and Haidushkata Dupka, a small cave. Roads Two transcontinental corridors intersect the municipality. The first one is from West and Central Europe, through Sofia - Harmanli - Svilengrad and Istanbul (European route E80 or –Ü-8), and the second one is from northern Europe through Ruse - Haskovo - Harmanli and the Mediterranean, on which basis Pan-European Corridor IX will be developed in the future.

As a kamikaze pilot, Lieutenant Seki led one of the three fighter groups of the second official kamikaze attack in World War II (the first official attack was an unsuccessful attempt led by on October 21, 1944). Seki's final action took place on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. He led a unit of five bomb-armed Mitsubishi Zero fighters, crash-diving his plane deliberately into the USS St. Lo's flight deck, being the first kamikazes to sink an enemy ship.  Early life  Yukio Seki was born 1921 in Iyo Saij≈ç, a small town in Shikoku. His parents ran an antiques store specializing in tea ceremony utensils. At an early age, Seki was exposed to naval training courses at his middle school and planned a career in the Navy. Since naval personnel were fully prepared to die in battle, and since Yukio was an only child, the family adopted a daughter nearly Yukio's age to carry on the family affairs. In 1938 he applied to enroll in the War Academy of both the Imperial Navy and the ground forces. He was accepted to both; he chose the Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima. During this time, his father died and his mother closed the antiques shop and lived alone. In 1941, one month before the Pearl Harbor attack, Seki graduated and was ordered to the battleship Fus≈ç. In June of the same year, he was promoted to lieutenant. Soon he was transferred to the seaplane carrier Chitose.\\"The Sacred Warriors: Japan‚Äôs Suicide Legions\\", Early life details corroborated on pages 45‚Äì48.  Service in World War II Yukio Seki in 1939 Seki saw several naval actions, and participated in a minor role in the Battle of Midway as his ship, Chitose, belonged to the second wave of Japanese ships. In 1942, Seki returned to Japan and enrolled in the Naval flying academy at Kasumigaura, Ibaraki. After basic training, he was transferred to Usa in ≈åita Prefecture, to be trained as a dive bomber operating from carriers. In January 1944, he became an instructor at Kasumigaura. Seki became friends with the Watanabe family living in Kamakura and fell in love with their daughter Mariko. Once when he was out drinking with his colleagues, one of them suggested that all of them should get married on the same day. They all agreed. The same weekend, Seki went to Kamakura and proposed to Mariko while her mother was present. Mariko accepted, and they were married May 31, 1944. Seki's mother Sekae was the only relative from his side to take part in the wedding. After the wedding, she lived with the young couple for a month and then left saying, \\"Young couples need some time alone\\". Soon after, they moved into a house close to the flying academy. In September 1944, Seki was transferred to Tainan, a city in Taiwan. He had to leave his wife behind because Tainan was not safe enough for them to go together. Mariko followed Seki to Yokohama to say goodbye to him. Three weeks after he had arrived in Tainan, he was transferred again, this time to the 201st Flotilla in the Philippines as leader of the 301st fighter unit. Their base was originally in Nicholas, but was later moved to Mabalacat, away from increasing attacks by the Americans. During this time, Vice Admiral Takijir≈ç ≈ånishi had been making plans for the first kamikaze attack, and Lieutenant Seki was given the opportunity by group commander Asaichi Tamai to lead a special attack squadron that would end in the loss of his own life. Seki is said to have closed his eyes, lowered his head and thought for ten seconds, before saying to Tamai, \\"Please do appoint me to the post.\\"The Japanese Navy in World War II (Chapter 13: The Kamikaze), by Rikihei Inoguchi and Tadashi Nakajima, p 424, Seki thereby became the leader of the squadron \\"Shikishima\\", which conducted the first official kamikaze attack, and the first to sink an enemy ship. Four times, his group returned to base in aborted sorties. =The kamikaze attack on Taffy 3= The men of the first kamikaze unit to make an attack on a US ship are offered a ceremonial toast of water as a farewell. Yukio Seki, the leader of the unit, is shown with a cup in his hands, and Vice Admiral Takijir≈ç ≈ånishi, who organized the first kamikaze unit, is in the middle of the photo facing the five men of the Shikishima Unit. The man offering the cup is likely Seki's officer, Asaichi Tamai USS White Plains. St. Lo's magazine detonates after Seki's attack On October 25, 1944, Lt. Seki's squadron of five kamikaze A6M2 Model 21 Zeros,Mitsubishi Zero A6M2 Model 21 each carrying a 250 kg (550-pound) bomb, took off with an escort of 4 A6M5's flown by legendary ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, Misao Sugawa, Shingo Honda and Ryoji Baba.TheHistoryNet Their target was Vice Admiral Clifton Sprague's \\"Taffy 3\\" task force during their desperate defense of the landings in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, having only a short while earlier survived an attack by the Imperial Japanese Navy Center Force led by Admiral Takeo Kurita that included the IJN flagship in the Battle off Samar before Kurita ordered the Center Force to return home after expending much of their ammunition meant for the Leyte landings against Taffy 3, only succeeding in sinking the destroyers USS Johnston and USS Hoel and destroyer escort USS Samuel B. Roberts before withdrawing. At 1050, Seki's squadron made their attack on four escort carriers of Taffy 3: * USS White Plains (CVE-66): Two planes attacked. AA fire scored a hit on one attacker who changed course for St. Lo. The second plane was destroyed by AA fire just yards astern of White Plains. White Plains was not hit, but debris was scattered on the aft deck, causing 11 minor injuries. * USS Kalinin Bay (CVE-68): Four diving planes attacked from astern. Two planes were shot down by AA fire. One crashed into the port side of the flight deck, damaging it badly. The other hit the aft port stack, destroying it. * USS Kitkun Bay (CVE-71): The port catwalk was clipped and the aircraft exploded off the port side, causing one death and no significant damage. * USS St. Lo (CVE-63): The plane which veered off from White Plains approached St. Lo. Her action report states: \\"Approaching the ramp at very high speed, the 'Zeke 52' crossed over the aft end of the ship at less than fifty feet. He appeared to push over sufficiently to hit the deck at about the 'number 5 wire', fifteen feet to the port side of the center line. A tremendous crash followed quickly followed by an explosion as one or both of the enemy's bombs exploded. The aircraft continued up the deck leaving fragments strewed about and its remnants went over the bow.\\" At first, the damage appeared minor. \\"There was a hole in the flight deck with smoldering edges which sprang into flame. Hoses were immediately run out from both sides of the flight deck and water started on the fire ... smoke soon appeared on both sides of the ship, evidently coming from the hangar. Within one to one and one-half minutes an explosion occurred on the hangar deck, which puffed smoke and flame through the hole in the deck and bulged the flight deck near and aft of the hole. This was followed in a matter of seconds by a much more violent explosion, which rolled back a part of the flight deck bursting through aft of the original hole. The next heavy explosion tore out more of the flight deck and also blew the forward elevator out of its shaft.\\" The magazine had detonated, and St. Lo was gone in half an hour.The Battle off Samar According to US Navy reports, there were no other kamikaze hits on US ships that day, although there was a \\"suicide\\" near miss on Kitkun Bay which was destroyed by AA fire from Kitkun Bay. Since this was at 1120 ‚Äì nearly one half-hour after Seki's attack ‚Äì and all five of Seki's kamikazes were apparently expended and the airplane was a Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber, it is unlikely it was part of Seki's group. Discrepancies It is debated whether Seki's plane sank St. Lo. Nishizawa survived the attack and made his report stating that Seki's plane glanced off the deck of a carrier but that the bomb did not explode. His description on this point closely matches the attack on St. Lo as reported by her captain. A second plane did score a hit on the same carrier that Seki attacked and that plane's bomb did explode. The only carrier with two hits was Kalinin Bay. However, the description is sharply different, since there was an immediate visibly large explosion following the first hit on Kalinin Bay, and no portions of the plane were seen to go over the bow. So Nishizawa's description of Seki's hit most closely matches that on St. Lo. A posting on an earlier USS St. Lo survivor site showed a photo purported to be of the engine serial number plate of the plane which sank the ship found on the deck by a sailor about to abandon ship. It was stated that the serial number was later traced back through Japanese authorities to the plane and the pilot who flew it that day, Lt. Seki. Prior to Seki's mission, Masashi Onoda, a Domei war correspondent, interviewed Yukio Seki and quotes him disparaging suicide attacks: > Japan's future is bleak if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots. I am > not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire ... I am going > because I was ordered to!\\"Kamikaze ‚Äì Japan's Suicide Gods\\", Page 16, written > by Albert Axell, an American writer and Hideaki Kase, living in Tokyo. In this interview, he gave insight into his thinking on how the carrier force should be attacked. \\"If they would let me, I could drop a 500 kilogram bomb on the flight deck of a carrier without going in for body-crashing and still make my way back.\\"The Sacred Warriors: Japan‚Äôs suicide Legions, page 89. During his flight, his commanders heard him say \\"It is better to die, rather than to live as a coward.\\" Whichever pilot actually sank St. Lo did so by releasing his bomb onto the flight deck, just as Seki described to the reporter, instead of crashing his plane directly onto the deck. The reports of the attack are consistent with that of a pilot who intended to return to base after successfully sinking St. Lo.

Created for Marvel predecessor Timely Comics, she first appeared in All Select Comics #11 (cover-dated Fall 1946), during the 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. The heroine was so well received that the next issue was retitled The Blonde Phantom, and continued to feature her until issue #22 (March 1949). She also appeared in backup stories in many other Timely comics; in Superhero Comics of the Golden Age, Mike Benton observes that \\"for a few months in 1948, readers could find her in seven titles on the newsstand.\\" Louise Grant is a secretary at the Mark Mason Detective Agency, and secretly in love with her boss. When he's on a case, Louise takes off her glasses and lets her hair down, becoming the glamorous masked hero, rescuing him from danger in a floor-length evening gown. In a gender reverse to the famous Superman/Lois Lane dynamic, Mark is in love with the Blonde Phantom, and has no interest in the mousy secretary back at the office. In The Supergirls, Mike Madrid writes, \\"Once again, a capable woman hid behind a meek persona and only let her hair down, literally, to come to the aid of a man who completely ignored her unless she assumed a disguise. In a 1947 story entitled \\"I Hate Myself\\", Louise even dreams that Mark finally confesses his love for her, only to have the Blonde Phantom persona appear and steal him away.\\" Louise returned in Modern Age comics as a sidekick for The Sensational She- Hulk, from 1989 to 1994. Publication history As superheroes began to fade out of fashion in the post-war era, comic book publishers scrambled to explore new types of stories, characters, and audiences. In an attempt to appeal to young female readers, comics companies began introducing some of the first significant superheroines since Wonder Woman. Those of Marvel Comics' 1940s predecessor, Timely Comics, included Golden Girl, Miss America, Namora, Sun Girl, and Venus, and its teen-humor star Millie the Model. Other companies' included Fox Comics' revival of Quality Comics' Phantom Lady; and DC's Black Canary. The creator of the Blonde Phantom is disputed. Don Markstein's Toonopedia says the character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Syd Shores, but Al Sulman claimed to have created the character during his time as script editor for Timely Comics: \\"Wonder Woman was popular, so Stan [Lee] thought we should have a heroine, too. So I created a character called 'The Blonde Phantom', and I wrote those strips myself.\\" The Blonde Phantom debuted in All Select Comics #11 (Fall 1946),The Blonde Phantom at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

The censorship was practised through a hierarchical but unofficial censorship apparatus, ultimately controlled by the ruling party (SED). Through censorship, the socialist point of view on society was ensured in all forms of literature, arts, culture and public communication. Due to the lack of an official censorship apparatus, censorship was applied locally in a highly structured and institutionalized manner under the control of the SED. Censorship in the Soviet occupation zone  Soviet Military Administration in Germany organised Censorship in East Germany in 1945. Its president was Sergei Ivanovich Tiulpanov. The list of banned books (Liste der auszusondernden Literatur) was published in 1946, 1947 and 1948.  Provisions of the East German constitution  The original 1949 version of the East German constitution did not provide for censorship of the press, but did guarantee in article 9, section 2 that \\"censorship of the media is not to occur\\". This provision was removed in the 1968 revision of the document, and expanded to become article 27, reflecting the modernization of technology: * \\"Every citizen has the right to freely and publicly advance his or her opinion in accordance to the principles of the constitution.\\" * \\"The freedom of press, broadcasting and television is warranted.\\" Despite this, both official and unofficial censorship occurred throughout the history of the GDR, although to a lessened extent during its later years. Because the GDR was effectively a one-party state under the command and guidance of the SED, the freedom of the press and other printing industries was at the will of the ruling party, the regime, and the ideological desires of the people in command. Although this apparently contradicts the above provisions, the fact that expression had to be \\"in accordance with the principles of the constitution\\" allowed the government to call on issues such as national security, public decency, and other issues covered in national law in order to enforce censorship.  Implementations  = Organization of censorship and censorship areas = There was no official censorship in the GDR, which is why there also weren't any official censorship organs. Censorship was applied in multiple different areas and was implemented locally, so usually through the responsible ministries and through the party (SED). The main areas in which censorship was applied were Literature, Media and Art and Culture.  Censorship in art and culture  The SED, under the official rubric of Kulturpolitik (cultural policy), established a framework of systematic control in order to exercise control over all literary and artistic production in the GDR. All publishers, as well as all public venues and exhibitions of art and culture, were subject to censorship that ensured the representation of the socialist point of view. = Censored topics = Content which was considered harmful to the regime, or to communist ideologies in general, was strictly forbidden. The definition of what could be harmful included a number of different categories. Most directly, criticism of communism was not tolerated. This included any criticisms of communism in general, as well as discussion of the contemporary regimes of the GDR and the Soviet Union, and usually of other Soviet-allied states. It also included discussion of the Stasi's activities and methods. Similarly, ideas which were sympathetic of capitalism or fascism, which were seen as the two enemies of communism, were not allowed. Any idea which encouraged resistance to the government, such as conscientious objection, was not to be discussed. Negative portrayals of the GDR were censored as well. This included criticisms and complaints about the standard of living and education in the country as well as calling attention to pollution and other problems of the industrial system. Republikflucht, or fleeing the GDR for West Germany or other countries, was not to be portrayed at all, nor was discussion of the Berlin Wall. Lastly, the government enforced strict standards of decency. \\"Crude\\" topics, such as homosexuality and pornography, were to be avoided. Similarly, portrayals of any East German as \\"uncivilized\\", through extreme violence or delinquency, or the suggestion that East Germans might suffer from problems such as alcoholism or suicidal depression were also to be excluded. In addition to censoring content, the government also reserved the right to disallow publication or exhibition on the basis of form. Anything not considered a \\"proper\\" form was barred. Disallowed forms and techniques included free verse poetry; internal monologue and stream of consciousness; nonsense or avant-garde; and abstract art. = Censorship in Literature = The procedural system of literary production allowed the state to exercise control over and coordinate the production of literature in the GDR. Through this system, the state incorporated literature production in its planned based economy. This allowed the state to influence its citizens and interpretations of literature in the GDR. The literature censorship system was composed of a large and complex network of interlocking institutions. The control mechanism for Literature in the GDR was two-fold: Control was applied through the SED itself and through the responsible ministries, sectors and divisions. The censoring process followed specific steps which enabled the government to plan and control the literature which would be published in the GDR. Authors worked together with editors from the publishing houses who were responsible for removing any problematic content from the manuscripts. In order to publish a manuscript, it had to be evaluated by a series of official and unofficial reviewers whose role it was to check the manuscripts for political and cultural appropriateness. After the writer and the editor were done with the manuscript, it was reviewed by two outside readers and an in-house committee for ideological implications. The last instance of power laid within the Ministry of Culture, where the print approval was given. The branch responsible for giving the approval for print was called head office for publishing companies and bookselling trade (Hauptverwaltung Verlage und Buchhandel, HV Verlage) which were directly tied to the SED. Especially difficult texts sometimes were given to a special SED central committee for additional reviewing. With the editor being the first instance of censorship, the outside readers and the committee were the second and the HV the third instance of governmental control over literary publications. Work was allowed to be published if it succeeded the Druckgenehmigungsverfahren and got issued an authorization from the Ministry of Culture, called a Druckgenehmigung. In case the ministry ordered changes to be made before publication, authors had the choice to either agree to them or not have their work published at all. = Censorship in Theatre = Similar to literature censorship, theatre production in the GDR was controlled and censored through a complex variety of interlocking institutions on multiple state levels, ultimately led by the SED. The central censorship institutions in theatre involved the Ministry of Culture and the Culture Department of the SED's Central Committee, in cooperation with the culture representative on the Politb√ºro. Furthermore, the Stasi used a network of informers to track developments in theatre. Theatre censorship existed of both pre- and post-play censorship. Pre-play censorship had multiple incentives and forms. Firstly, unexpected public disorder was aimed to be prevented by only granting permission to productions given that they were restricted in size and composition. Secondly, censors not only tried to predict the influence of a play on the audience, but also how SED party officials would react to it. Post-play censorship in the GDR happened in an unusual manner due to its unofficial character. If censors deemed a play to be unwanted by the regime, a play could not be banned on grounds of being unconstitutional. Therefore, producers were forced to take responsibility for supposed mistakes and instead of being banned, revised and censored versions of a play were staged. An example of theatre censorship in the GDR is the play Egmont by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that was supposed to be staged in August 1949 in the Erfurt theatre. Officials argued that: \\"the political maturity and the progressive consciousness of the Thuringian population, the directors, and the actors [were] not yet sufficiently developed for them to place the context of the play in correct relation to the political situation of the present day.\\". In fact, the reason for the censorship of the play was that the portrayal of the Dutch revolt against Spanish occupiers in the play by Goethe would reflect negatively on Soviet occupation in Eastern Germany. = Censorship in Art = = Execution and consequences = Disobeying the rules for acceptable releases carried varying penalties. At the very least, the offending party would be warned and the material in question would not be published or exhibited. Bans from publishing or performing were also levied in order to keep the material from being released. Punitive measures were also taken, including arrest or house arrest. Party members could be expelled from the SED, and visa requests were frequently denied to offenders. In the most extreme of circumstances, an offender could be deported, most often to West Germany. Censorship and punishment, however, were not carried out uniformly. For example, if the creator was a party member of the SED, the work was offered more leniency. Furthermore, if the creator had been successful, their work was also more easily passed. If he or she had political relationships (either the \\"wrong\\" or \\"right\\" ones), the censorship process was affected as well. Finally, because many regulations were subjective or unclear, a censor who enjoyed a piece might afford it leniency where another would not. Very often, pieces banned in one area were allowed in others for this reason. Many artists and authors tried to avoid conflicts from the outset, working hard to create works that fit into the guidelines. This phenomenon was called the \\"shear in the head\\". Others took the omnipresence of censorship as a challenge. For them, it was stimulus to their creativity. These dissenters, known as \\"wrap artists\\", tried to avoid censorship with clever usage of artistic instruments like satire, irony, metaphor, or alienation to say the desired in a different and, for the censor, unrecognizable way, with mixed results. Censorship in film  Censorship in journalism  Several times a week, press information was released from the public relations office. In this press information were guidelines for the press, and how to deal with up-to- date issues. Prescribed terminologies for press, broadcasting, and television were included. The public relation office was authorized to give instructions to the General German Press Agency (German: Allgemeine Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur). = Apprenticeships of journalists = Journalists were seen by the regime as functionaries of the party, not as independent reporters. The journalistic apprenticeship took place at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig, which had a special program for journalism. If a journalist finished the studies successfully, the journalist became a certified \\"socialistic journalist\\". The selection of potential students was the business of the state. A national governmental pre-selection of candidates was done before the apprenticeship. Within the studies, journalists learned the socialistic ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Only candidates who were considered likely to work to uphold those ideals were certified. = Organization of journalists = In addition, attempts were made to collectivize journalists within the government. To be member of the Journalistic Collective (Verband der Journalisten der DDR, VDJ) provided advantages to the members, and made it possible to achieve better positions. Approximately 90 percent of certified journalists were organized within the VDJ. The VDJ journalist understood himself as a professional educator of other journalists. The VDJ advised the students in the journalism program of the university in Leipzig. Ideologically, was it used to consolidate the idea of socialist journalism. The VDJ also operated its own school for journalism in Leipzig. This school provided advanced training courses. The school became very popular with aspiring journalists as a result of the possibility to make contacts through socializing with VDJ members. = Free journalists and participation of citizens = Amateurs participated in public press work beside the professional journalists. These untrained co-workers were called Volkskorrespondenten, \\"the people's correspondents\\". These reporters were honorary workers in press and broadcast, and special journalists of companies. Having worked as a Volkskorrespondent was looked upon favorably in applications for journalism apprenticeship. Those citizens who participated in the Volkskorrespondent program were more likely to receive admission to the journalism program in Leipzig. Some independent journalists attempted to publish material critical of the government. This was normally unsuccessful, as all publications were censored. Continual or substantial transgressions made a journalist vulnerable to the same punishments as those levied against artists and publishers. = Censorship of Media = Censorship of mass media in the GDR began with the restructuring and centralization of the media networks in the GDR. Production was set up centrally in Berlin, while print media was outsourced to local SED-offices. The centralized, SED-led news information service ADN (Allgemeine Deutsche Nachrichtendienst) had the monopoly on news distribution and so controlled which information could appear in GDR media. Through this institutional structure, censorship was applied indirectly, which made official censorship unnecessary. Any distribution of non-GDR news was forbidden. The central organ of the SED (and therefore the main newspaper in the GDR) was called 'Neues Deutschland'. This newspaper owned by the SED reported daily on developments within the party and the state in general. Like the print media, radio and television were also state- controlled. There were five state-controlled TV-channels, which distributed SED-approved information and culturally appropriate entertainment.

The Village Gate was a nightclub at the corner of Thompson and Bleecker Streets in Greenwich Village, New York. Art D'Lugoff opened the club in 1958, on the ground floor and basement of 160 Bleecker Street. The large 1896 Chicago School structure by architect Ernest Flagg was known at the time as Mills House No. 1 and served as a flophouse for transient men. In its heyday, the Village Gate also included an upper-story performance space, known as the Top of the Gate. Throughout its 38 years, the Village Gate featured such musicians as John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins, Duke Ellington, Jimi Hendrix, Dizzy Gillespie, Bill Evans, Dave Brubeck, Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Art Blakey, Woody Shaw, Miles Davis, Stan Getz, Vasant Rai, Nina Simone, Herbie Mann, Woody Allen, Patti Smith, Velvet Underground, Edgard Var√®se, and Aretha Franklin, who made her first New York appearance there. The show Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, debuted at the Village Gate in 1968. History In the 1960s, radio DJ and Latin music advocate Symphony Sid hosted a regular Monday night concert at the Village Gate - \\"Monday Nights at the Gate\\" - featuring the best of New York's thriving Latin music scene. As salsa music began to grow in popularity, the Alegre record label began to host quite a few events at the Village Gate - many of which resulted in live recordings. Some of the live recordings from the Village Gate were the Alegre All-Star (and later Tico All-Star) Descarga sessions. The \\"Salsa Meets Jazz\\" series at the Village Gate was a seminal part of the history of New York Latin music. In 1977, WRVR jazz and Latin music DJ and jazz musician/conga drummer Roger Dawson created and hosted a weekly event that brought top Latin bands together with a guest jazz soloist. Dawson named the event \\"Salsa Meets Jazz\\". Sonny Stitt with Eddie Palmieri, Dexter Gordon with Machito, Dizzy Gillespie with Tito Puente, James Moody, Wynton Marsalis, Bobby Hutcherson, David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, Slide Hampton, and Pharoah Sanders, to name a few, all jumped in to \\"jam\\" with the best salsa bands of the time. The club hosted a benefit for Timothy Leary in May 1970 that featured performances from such counterculture luminaries as Jimi Hendrix and Allen Ginsberg. From 1971 to 1973, a musical comedy revue called National Lampoon's Lemmings had a successful run at the Gate. It starred future comic notables John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Garry Goodrow, and Christopher Guest, and lampooned the 1969 Woodstock Festival, which had taken place upstate two years earlier, calling it \\"Woodchuck\\" and equating the entire hippie generation with lemmings bent on self-destruction. Let My People Come opened at the Village Gate Theater in 1974. The show broke all box office records there and played for 1,167 performances. Its transfer to the Morosco Theatre on Broadway was not as successful, though, and closed after 106 performances. It was nominated for a Grammy in 1974 and has appeared all over the world. From 1989 to 1991, the improvisational comedy troupe Noo Yawk Tawk performed at the upstairs theater. The group was conceived and directed by Richmond Shepard, a world-renowned mime, actor, comedian, and teacher. All of the performances for Noo Yawk Tawk were entirely improvised. Characters may have been repeated, but never the sketches or the dialogue. The audience always set the scene and conditions for each improvisation, so every performance was different. The cast included Stan Taffel, Marc Kudisch, Debra Wilson, Eric Douglas, Garry Goodrow, Miguel Sierra, Ken Dashow, Nola Roeper, Bonnie Comley, and Richmond Shepard. Taffel would go on to win three Emmy Awards for his performances in The News In Revue on PBS. Kudisch earned a Tony nomination in 2002. The Village Gate name was again used in 1996 at 240 West 52nd Street. Art D'Lugoff, co-producer of the show A Brief History of White Music was looking to rent the space in a site formerly occupied by the Lone Star Road House. That incarnation and the show lasted until 1997. In 1998, the 52nd Street location was taken by a brief reincarnation of Max's Kansas City. The Village Gate closed its Greenwich Village location in February 1994. The ground floor is currently occupied by CVS/Pharmacy. The off-Broadway capacity Village Theater, which hosted performances of the musically themed Love, Janis, Dream a Little Dream, Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, and Escape From Bellevue, occupied the sublevel performance space until fall 2007. In spring 2008, the space was reopened as a multiuse performance venue and gallery bar called (Le) Poisson Rouge. The club is mentioned by salsa superstars Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz in their song Pancho Cristal, off their 1980 LP Los Dur√≠simos.

He has coached at Boston University, George Washington University and St. John's University. He also has worked as a commentator for college basketball games on ESPN. His career college coaching record in over 18 seasons is 364‚Äì201. Early life Jarvis was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and played high school basketball at Rindge Technical High School, the predecessor to Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. He also coached at Rindge and Latin, where his players included NBA players Patrick Ewing, Rumeal Robinson and former George Washington head coach Karl Hobbs. He played basketball and baseball at Northeastern University, graduating in 1968. College coaching career Jarvis became head coach at Boston University in 1985, becoming the Terriers' all-time winningest coach in five seasons with a 101-50 record (he was later overtaken by Bob Brown, then Dennis Wolff). Boston University reached the NCAA Tournament in 1988 and 1990 under Jarvis. He was hired at George Washington in 1990, leading the Colonials to three NCAA tournament appearances, including the Sweet 16 in the 1993 NCAA Tournament, the Colonials' best tournament performance. The team was defeated by the \\"Fab Five\\" Michigan Wolverines, who later vacated the entire season due to a scandal with a booster. Jarvis also led the Colonials to two victories over number one ranked UMass, compiling a 143‚Äì100 record at George Washington. Jarvis also coached the United States under-22 men's national team in 1993. =St. John's= After the 1998 season, Jarvis accepted the head coaching job at St. John's University after Fran Fraschilla was fired, leading the Red Storm to the Elite Eight in the 1999 NCAA Tournament and the 2000 Big East tournament championship. They won the National Invitation Tournament in 2003. The next season the Red Storm stumbled out of the gate, losing to several nonconference teams that they usually beat with ease.

His final record at St. John's was 110‚Äì61. It later emerged that school officials had fired Jarvis in part due to a series of embarrassing off-court incidents. Among these, a junior college transfer had been charged with assaulting a female student, and a senior guard had been kicked off the team after being caught smoking marijuana near St. John's campus in Queens. During the 2003‚Äì04 season, St. John's center Abe Keita claimed that a member of Jarvis's basketball staff had paid him nearly $300 a month for the past four seasons. As a result, St. John's placed itself on two years' probation, withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2004‚Äì05 season, and forfeited 43 wins in which Keita participated. This included the team's NIT championship in 2003, making St. John's the third team in the history of the NIT to be forced to vacate its standing in the tournament; the two previous schools, Minnesota and Michigan, had also won the tournament in their respective years. The NCAA accepted St. John's sanctions and faulted Jarvis for not properly monitoring Keita's situation, but otherwise cleared him of wrongdoing.USATODAY.com - St. John's placed on 2 years probation by NCAA After his ouster, Jarvis was criticized for ignoring New York City's rich pool of high school players, which particularly rankled fans used to seeing national powerhouses built primarily on New York City talent.Jacobson, Mike.

Projects The Center helped fund Christopher W. Ruddy (who later founded NewsMax) to investigate conspiracies surrounding the death of Vincent Foster, which was part of the Arkansas Project. Eventually, \\"the Center placed some 50 ads reprinting Ruddy's Pittsburgh Tribune-Review stories in the Washington Times, then repackaged the articles as a packet titled \\"The Ruddy Investigation,\\" which sold for $12.\\" In addition, \\"Farah also bought full page ads publicizing Ruddy's allegations that appeared in papers including The New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and Los Angeles Times\\" and \\"the ad campaign brought in over $500,000, half from individual donors-many of whom bought Foster conspiracy materials-and half from foundations, including $100,000 from Carthage.\\" The Carthage Foundation is controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife, whose foundations gave $330,000 to the Center in 1994 and 1995.

According to Farah, after announcing the audit IRS agents inquired as to why the Center was investigating the death of Clinton deputy White House counsel Vince Foster. And that on their first visit an IRS field agent named Thomas Cederquist explained that the audit was a 'political case.' The audit found the Center to be in total compliance with the law. In 1998, with the help of Judicial Watch the Center sued the IRS claiming it was audited in 1996 for political reasons. The lawsuit was thrown out, with appeals denied. A lower court ruled that the IRS could not be sued on allegations of politically motivated auditing practices, while a federal appeals court ruled that the Center's lawsuit was barred by the statute of limitations. Ownership In 1997, Farah created the news website WorldNetDaily as a division of the Western Journalism Center. In 1999, WorldNetDaily was spun off as a for-profit division of the Center. The Center and Farah own a majority of WorldNetDaily's stock.

The church of Mar Gewargis was constructed in 1925, and by 1938, 152 people inhabited the village, with 27 families.

Violence against Assyrians in urban centres of Iraq led 102 displaced Assyrians, with 27 families, to seek refuge in Badarash by early 2009.

The transfer of the settlor's assets to the bypass trust for the benefit of the spouse is a tax-free transfer under the currently unlimited Marital Deduction. At the settlor's death, the assets in the bypass trust are not included in the settlor's estate, effectively reducing the total value of the estate and therefore potentially limiting the estate taxes owed at the settlor's death. Bypass trusts are used in the United States as a legitimate tool to circumvent gift tax, and to minimize taxation of assets upon death of a married couple. The term may have different meanings in other jurisdictions. In the United States A bypass trust is a long-term planning device. It is typically created as part of an A/B Living trust estate plan after the death of the first spouse to die. During life, a married couple transfers ownership of property into a trust. Upon the death of the first party to die, the terms of the trust require that some portion of the property be transferred into \\"TRUST A\\" and some other portion into \\"TRUST B.\\" Trust A holds property that remains accessible to the surviving spouse during his or her life. That way the surviving spouse has enough wealth at hand to provide for his or her needs until death. Trust B receives the other portion of the original trust's property in a manner that minimizes taxation, which necessarily prevents it from being accessible to the surviving spouse during his or her life. This trust is meant to pass on property to heirs, usually the spouse's children, on death of the remaining spouse, but in a way that minimizes the estate tax and gift tax that would have been applied to the property if it had passed through a will, or if given as a gift during life (gift inter vivos).What is a bypass trust? A bypass trust receives property as specified in the trust document - the bypass trust may receive all of the property of the decedent spouse, or half of the spouses' co-owned property, or it may receive enough property to make full use of the decedent's estate tax exclusion. It is important that each trust be drafted with absolute precision as the IRS has specified the exact wording to be used. The bypass trust is typically created to achieve one or more of the following goals: * To maximize the use of the decedent's estate tax exclusion amount, in order to minimize estate tax upon the death of the surviving spouse * To ensure that the decedent's spouse's property will be disposed of in accordance with the decedent's wishes, even if the surviving spouse remarries or chooses to adopt a different estate plan for the surviving spouse's assets.

His father was composer Lowell Mason, a leading figure in American church music, and his younger brother, Henry Mason, was a co-founder of the piano manufacturers Mason and Hamlin. Career Mason was born in Boston. After a successful debut at the Boston Academy of Music, he went to Europe in 1849; there he was the first American piano student of Franz Liszt and Ignaz Moscheles. He became the leader of a chamber ensemble based in New York that introduced many works of Robert Schumann and other famous Europeans to Americans during the Civil War era and beyond, at a time when classical music still had little specifically American identity. Mason published numerous pedagogical works for the piano student, but is remembered above all for his Chopinesque compositions for piano. The American composer and pianist Edward MacDowell (1860-1908) dedicated his second piano sonata, Op. 50 Sonata Eroica (1895), to William Mason. He died in New York City, aged 79.

Night markets in Taiwan are similar to those in areas inhabited by ethnic Han. A few, such as Huaxi Street Tourist Night Market (or Snake Alley), utilize purpose-built marketplaces, but most occupy either sidewalks or even entire streets that carry vehicle and pedestrian traffic by day. Some night markets in smaller side streets and alleys feature retractable roofs. Most night markets operate daily and feature a mixture of individual stalls selling clothing, consumer goods, xiaochi (similar to snacks or fast food), and specialty drinks. The atmosphere is usually crowded and noisy with hawkers shouting and fast-paced music playing over loudspeakers. Taiwanese night markets have evolved over the years from small local gatherings to noisy streets lined with vendors. These vendors must adhere to regulations placed on their activities by the Taiwanese government. Shilin Night Market, Shilin, Taipei, Taiwan History The concept of the night market traces its roots back to the Chinese Tang dynasty. The Tang Dynasty government put strict sanctions on night markets and their operations in A.D. 836. Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, economic expansion led to less state regulation and restrictions being lifted on night markets. During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), night markets played a central role in Chinese nightlife. These markets were found in corners of large cities. Some stayed open for twenty- four hours. Song period night markets are also known to have included restaurants and brothels due to being frequently located near business districts and red light districts. Taiwanese night markets started as local markets that operated in urban sites. Most night markets started as small gatherings in street corners or in temple plazas. These markets were joined by retailers who sold handicrafts and traditional medicine. One example of a night market network is Taipei. Small gatherings of night vendors lined up the streets of Taipei, but still the city was not classified as a night market. Taipei was not known to be prosperous until after World War II. Starting in the 1950s, Night markets formed in Taipei's old urban areas and later settlements were set up across the city's edges. In the 1970s, night markets spread into new suburbs and manufacturing areas. There were also traveling periodic night markets that could even be found in rural towns. By the 1980s, anyone could buy a full range of goods even in a remote area. In the 1950s and 1960s, migrant urban workers made up a large base of the night market's customers. The vendors created simplified versions of banquet dishes and served xiaochi foods. The names of the towns came from the dishes they served. The serving of xiaochi foods attracted Taiwan's local elite. Stories were formed of how well-known politicians and intellectuals visited night market stalls. Night markets started to embody the local and the global modern popular culture because of commercial industries. Because of the global recession in the 1970s, canceled imports created more opportunities for vendors selling light industry and family made goods. This was due to more products becoming available to local markets. Night marketing networks were formed and sold Taiwan's light industry goods. Because of the prosperity of the night markets, some traditional businesses were replaced by higher quality garment and shoe stores in the 1980s. The energetic night markets were known during this period where neon signs, loud music and light displays were used to attract customers. The new replaced the old, cafeterias instead of restaurants, gift shops instead of sundry shops, sportswear outlets instead of low quality garment stores. At Taiwan's stock market surge, chains started opening franchises that were located in or near the night markets. These included fast food outlets such as McDonald's and convenience stores such as 7-Elevens, which were then followed by garment stores. This transformation continued in the 1990s, when chains who sold higher grade merchandise replaced individually owned businesses. Night markets changed from places that sold traditional snack food and handicrafts to modern centers of popular culture. Markets rapidly responded to new trends by producing their own versions of popular goods, especially in the 1990s, when copyright and intellectual property laws were only loosely enforced. These counterfeit items that now flooded the market attracted young customers. In recent years, these laws are now more strictly enforced so counterfeit items are usually found in traveling night markets. The night markets are now known for not personifying Taiwan as it once did. The night market transformed to accommodate the modern capitalist economies of present day. 21st century Night markets in Taiwan have become famous for their xiaochi, an important category of Chinese food which literally translates to \\"small eats\\". Served in portions similar to Spanish tapas, these dishes are often served as carry-out items, but many sellers provide small folding tables and stools for customers who would like to sit while they eat. These dishes are offered at low prices, usually around $30 to $50 NTD (‚âà$1‚Äì$1.75 USD). Visitors who expect to eat enough to be full during a trip to the night market will usually spend around $100NTD - $300NTD (‚âà$3‚Äì$10 USD). Most night markets also have some small restaurants, which provide a number of simple courses that allow people to finish a full meal without having to eat their way through the entire market. Though some of the xiaochi foods available will change from year to year with passing fads, certain xiaochi foods such as oyster omelets, chicken shawarma, and stinky tofu persist and have become staples in many night markets. Sometimes, the night markets of a city, or even just one particular market within that city, become well known for a certain type of food that is unique to the area, or prepared particularly well there. For example, Tainan has become known for its ta-a noodles and \\"coffin cakes\\", bread baked into the shape of a stuffed, hollowed out coffin. In Taipei, the Shilin Night Market features a particular store, which is well known for serving tasty fried chicken breast in large portions and for a low price. There is also the iron eggs from Tamsui. In recent years, many of the night markets have become popular tourist destinations among sightseeing foreign travelers. It is common to see many travelers with cameras, snapping photographs amidst the crowds (and of the crowds) within the streets. Some of the night markets, such as the Shilin (at Yuanshan, Taipei) and Shida night markets (next to National Taiwan Normal University) are among the first places that Taiwanese students will bring international students for a cultural experience. In addition to food, night markets feature various forms of entertainment and a lot of shopping. Numerous products for sale include clothes, bags, shoes, trinkets, kitchen items, etc. Some night markets will have areas that are dedicated to certain products such as clothes, which are sold both by street vendors in the 100 to 300 NTD (‚âà$3‚Äì$10 USD) range and in the small storefronts lining the streets usually priced slightly higher in the 300 to 500 NTD range. These shops are often open during the day as well, especially during the afternoon before the evening rush. Carnival-style games are typically available to play for the price of a few coins. The night market in Tamsui is especially well known for featuring traditional carnival games such as balloon shooting, net fish, shooting marbles, and an assortment of mini games that could only have otherwise been seen many years ago. =Vendors= Vendors practice a type of small scale entrepreneurship run, for the most part, by family. The Vendors are recognized and protected by law. They are required to pay taxes and have licenses. Merchants are managed through their Night Market committee. The consent of the committee is required to acquire a license. Tourist Night Markets are classified as between formal and informal businesses. It provides a way for local people to take part in the Taiwanese tourist industry. A hawker making oyster omelets in Shilin Night Market, Shilin, Taipei, Taiwan.

The Night Market has grown from just a few shops to a whole commercial district that extends from the Tunghai University. Fengyuan Myaudung Night Market People used to gather around the local Tzu-Chi Temple where merchants served the crowds of people that encircled the courtyard and the temple.

It teaches students in year levels 9 to 13. , Mount Albert Grammar School is the second largest school in New Zealand, behind Rangitoto College. History Mount Albert Grammar was founded in 1922 as a subsidiary of Auckland Grammar School, but now the two schools are governed separately. Mount Albert Grammar School was originally boys only, but became co-educational in 2000. Junior classes (years 9 and 10) are mostly single-sex while senior classes (years 11 to 13) are all co-educational. There have been a number of headmasters since the opening of the school, Frederick Gamble (1922‚Äì1946), William Caradus (1946‚Äì1954), Murray Nairn (1954‚Äì1969), Maurice Hall (1970‚Äì1988), Gregory Taylor (1988‚Äì2006, the first Albertian to become Headmaster), Dale Burden (2006‚Äì2015), and the current headmaster, Patrick Drumm (2016‚Äì). After the opening of the school, a need for boarding accommodation for students became apparent. In 1927, the Mount Albert Grammar School Hostel opened for boarders at 807 New North Road. This hostel closed in 1970 and a new one was opened in 1971, built on one of the school's playing fields. This is a boys' boarding hostel called School House. It has full-time accommodation for up to 105 students during school terms. The School's Latin motto is Per Angusta Ad Augusta, which means \\"Through Hardship to Glory\\". The school hymn, sung at all formal assemblies, was written by a student, J. A. W. Bennett, in 1928. In October 2015, an email containing a pornographic image was sent to all the school's 2,700 students after the school's email database was reportedly hacked by one of the school's students. The email database was immediately shut down and an investigation was started into who was responsible. The school laid a complaint with police and sought the assistance of the Department of Internal Affairs. The school purchased what was meant to be a girls' hostel, but due to the Auckland housing crisis turned into accommodation for teachers. The complex is located 6 minute walk away from MAGS on Lloyd Avenue. On July 24 2020, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern officially opened the school's new science block, known as CS block and honouring the school's second headmaster, William Caradus. This was set to take place on March 24, however was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The block has been in use since classes commenced for the 2020 school year. Academia Mt Albert Grammar School pupils participate in various forms of academia, from year 9 to year 13. In 2015, 93.8 percent of students leaving Mount Albert Grammar held at least NCEA Level 1, 87.7 percent held at least NCEA Level 2, and 67.8 percent held at least NCEA Level 3. This is compared to 88.4%, 79.1%, and 52.8% respectively for all students nationally. Sports In 2007 and 2009 MAGS won all the major Auckland titles in Rugby, Soccer and Netball. The First XI girls football and the Premier Girls Basketball also won their first Auckland Championships in 2009. In 2008, one sports staff member and a parent coach were suspended by the schools' sport body College Sport and nine students who had transferred to the school were prevented from playing by rules designed to prevent poaching of young players. As a result, the school implemented a sporting Code of Conduct for all students, staff and coaches. This ultimately led to the dismissal of Director of Football, Kevin Fallon. Mt Albert Aquatic Centre The Mt Albert Aquatic Centre was developed as a joint project between Mount Albert Grammar School and the Auckland City Council. It was officially opened by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1998. The facility contains a 25-metre competition pool with depths measuring from 1.2 metres to 3 metres, and a leisure pool that features wave motion and a water slide. The complex consists of other features visited by the public often. However, in 2016 the pool was noted to be unsafe due to its vulnerability to earthquakes. The pool is set to be either fixed or demolished in the next ten years. Mount Albert Grammar School Farm This is a photo of the Mount Albert Grammar School Farm as seen from the upper floor of MH Block, formerly known as D Block. Since 1933 Mount Albert Grammar School has had a 10.8 ha farm adjacent to its school site in the middle of Auckland city. It is a fully working model farm, home to sheep, pigs, rabbits, cattle and poultry, cared for by a farm manager who lives on site. The land is owned by the ASB Bank, which in 2013 extended the school's lease costing 1 dollar every year for 99 years, taking the ownership through to 2112. Students are able to study Agricultural Science from Year 10 onwards, and also travel to farms and agricultural training centres for day trips and camps. They attend Field Days at Mystery Creek each year and some students are selected to assist in the agricultural area of the Auckland Easter Show. As well as a classroom the farm has a one-stand wool shed with wool-handling facilities, pens to hold 150 sheep overnight, a two-stand walk-through milking shed with milking plant, an implement shed and a unit for small animals. Observatory The school is one of a few schools in New Zealand with an active observatory and possesses a telescope open to students and the public occasionally. Completed in 2008, the observatory has a Meade Instruments LX200R 12-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain f/10 telescope. The observatory uses an SBIG ST7XME CCD camera for imaging and photometry. The observatory is used for both school education and amateur research.  School Hymn  The school hymn is sung at all formal school assemblies, normally accompanied by live piano. It was written by MAGS student Jack A. W. Bennett in 1928. The lyrics to the hymn were analysed in a report written by Brian Murphy, the School Archivist. ERO report In 2018 Education Review Office had carried a survey and found that the school uses National Certificate of Educational Achievement and it celebrates its achievements through Lion Awards. Its achievement is above the national average which makes them one of the top seven schools in the country. The ethnic minorities of the school had shifted the balance since the 2015 review. By that, 91% of MƒÅori and 85% of Pacific students gained NCEA Level 2 in 2017. The school enrolls 2991 students out of which 57% are male and 43% are female. Out of those, 40% are of European descent, 23% are Asian, 19% are identified as Pacific Islanders, 3% are MELAA and 2% are of other ethnicity.

Life and career Born in Vienna, the son of an opera singer, Marian turned to the stage early, though he never attended any drama classes. He ran away from home and abandoned his studies as an engineer to work as an extra at several Austrian and German theatres. In 1938 he joined the ensemble of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, where he was acclaimed for his performance as Iago in Shakespeare's Othello. Marian had also appeared in movies like Curtis Bernhardt's Der Tunnel since 1933, and had his breakthrough starring together with Zarah Leander in 1937's La Habanera directed by Detlef Sierck. His role as Don Pedro added to his image as an adorable but devious womanizer. =Jud S√º√ü= Marian's career was overshadowed by his appearance as the title character in Jud S√º√ü, a notorious antisemitic German movie directed by Veit Harlan. This 1940 film, made under the supervision of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, is widely considered to be one of the most hateful depictions of Jews in film. Several film stars had rejected the title role; Marian, urged by Goebbels and fearing consequences by the Reichsfilmkammer, did not dare to refuse. His depiction of the title character followed Nazi propaganda stereotypes of Jews as being materialistic, immoral, cunning and untrustworthy. With the exception of Marian's character ‚Äì who shaved off his beard and wore Gentile attire for most of the story ‚Äì the actors playing Jewish male characters were made up to look unappealing and alien (non- German). There were also scenes that purported to show Jewish religious services. Marian also appeared in the 1941 propaganda movie Ohm Kr√ºger, playing Cecil Rhodes side by side with Emil Jannings and Gustaf Gr√ºndgens, who both had rejected the role of Jud S√º√ü the year before. In 1943 he starred as Cagliostro in Josef von B√°ky's fantasy comedy M√ºnchhausen. =Personal life= Marian's personal life contradicted his role in the film Jud S√º√ü. He had a daughter from his first marriage to Jewish pianist Irene Saager. His second wife's former husband Julius Gellner was also Jewish and Marian and his wife protected him from reprisals by hiding him in their home.Jud S√ºss Film Reference, retrieved on September 26, 2010. Marian died in a road accident in 1946 near the village of D√ºrneck (today part of Freising) in Bavaria, probably driving under the influence of alcohol. It is said that he was on his way to Munich with a borrowed car to collect denazification papers that with the permission of US film officer Eric Pleskow would allow him to work again, having celebrated this news just beforehand. Other sources suggest that the accident was suicide. The 2010 film Jew Suss: Rise and Fall by Oskar Roehler, starring Tobias Moretti, portrayed the production of Jud S√º√ü with Marian as the central character.  Filmography  * The Tunnel (1933) (dir.

His father was Marcus Licinius Crassus Agelastus and his brother Marcus Licinius Crassus served as a praetor in 107 BC. Before his consulship, he proposed a law regulating expenses of the table, which was approved. He became consul in 97 BC. In his consulship, the senate abolished the practising of magic arts and human sacrifice. Between 97 BC and 93 BC, he served in Hispania Ulterior as governor and won a battle over the Lusitani, for which he was awarded and honoured with a triumph. He served as a censor in 89 BC. As a censor, he banned foreign wines and unguents. He later became an electorate officer dividing new citizens into voting districts. His colleague was long-time friend Lucius Julius Caesar III. Publius had a small house despite his immense wealth. His sons by his wife Venuleia were Publius Licinius Crassus (who died in the Social War), Lucius Licinius Crassus (killed in 87 BC) and Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives, the triumvir. He remained with his family for the rest of his life, living long enough to see the two sons Publius and Lucius marry, as well as the birth of his first grandchild. Conflict between the Populares under Gaius Marius and the Optimates under Lucius Cornelius Sulla was escalating in the 80s BC. Although originally a supporter of Marius, Publius adopted a more neutral position opposed to the methods of both Marius and Sulla. He was killed, or committed suicide to avoid a more humiliating death, after the Marians took Rome in 87 BC. As author? The geographer Strabo refers to a treatise on the Cassiterides, the semi- legendary Tin Islands regarded as situated somewhere near the west coasts of Europe, written by a Publius CrassusStrabo, 3.5.11, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius online. but not now extant. Several scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries, including Theodor MommsenTheodor Mommsen, History of Rome (1894), vol. 4, p. 63 = R√∂mische Geschichte (1889), vol. 3, p. 269, as cited by Holmes, Ancient Britain p. 495, note 1. and T. Rice Holmes, thought that this prose work resulted from an expedition during Publius's grandson's occupation of Armorica.Various views on the subject documented by T. Rice Holmes, \\"The Cassiterides, Ictis, and the British Trade in Tin,\\" in Ancient Britain and the Invasions of Julius Caesar (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1907) pp. 483‚Äì498; on authorship, pp. 494‚Äì497 Scholars of the 20th and early 21st centuries have been more inclined to assign authorship to the elder Publius, during his proconsulship in Spain in the 90s BC, in which case the grandson's Armorican mission may have been prompted in part by business interests and a desire to capitalize on the earlier survey of resources.Christopher Hawkes, ‚ÄúBritain and Julius Caesar,‚Äù Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124‚Äì192; also J.S. Richardson, Hispaniae: Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, 218‚Äì82 BC (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 159 online. T.

While numerous martial arts borrow or adapt from other arts and to some extent could be considered hybrids, a hybrid martial art emphasizes its disparate origins. The idea of hybridization or \\"mixing\\" of martial arts traditions originates in the 19th to early 20th century, when Asian traditions first came to the attention of European practitioners. The concept rose to wide popularity during the 1960s and 1970s, with the development of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do (1967), which uses aspects derived from various arts including Wing Chun, catch wrestling, boxing, judo and Kickboxing; Kajukenbo (1947), which combines Karate, Judo/Jujitsu, Kenpo and Western Boxing; modern kickboxing styles that incorporate elements of Karate, Muay Thai and Western boxing, Krav Maga, an Israeli military combat and self- defense fighting system incorporating Western boxing, Muay Thai, jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and grappling; and Combat Sambo, russian combat system incorporating the next martial arts: Savate, Judo, Karate, Jiu jitsu, Kung Fu, Greek Wrestling, Georgian Chidaoba, Azerbaijani Gulesh, Armenian Koch, Kurash, B√∂th, Alysh, Tr√Ænta.  Mixed martial arts  Since 1993, hybridization of martial arts has culminated in the development of mixed martial arts (MMA), a practice which combined the already hybridized styles of Brazilian Vale Tudo fighting and Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do, among others. Jeet Kune Do is actually the only philosophy that is often confused as a fighting style but actually represents the belief of using \\"no way as way\\" or one's best way as a technique. This formless technique exists beyond the realm of street fighting or in-competition tournaments. Although, Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do was a hybrid of different Martial Arts systems, and contrary to popular belief, Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do is not responsible for the creation of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA). The term mixed martial arts, while in its literal meaning a synonym, has come to refer to this specific combat sport.

It broadcasts with 1000 watts day and night on 1450 kHz from studios in South Corning, NY. It is a talk radio station, branded as The Patriot as other Waypoint Media stations are.  History  It was founded as WCLI by the Corning Leader newspaper in 1950 as the first AM station licensed to Corning and the fourth station in the market. It joined FM station WKNP, which had signed on in 1947 and was Corning's first station. Both were owned by the Corning Leader newspaper and broadcast from its building, then located at Erie Avenue (now Dennison Parkway) and Walnut Street in Corning. Long time radio engineer, Mark Saia, reports that his father, Frank Saia, and Bob Shaddock were the first two broadcasters hired. Both on the same day. The Erie Railroad mainline passed nearby and passing freight and passenger trains used to shake the building‚Äîand the recorded music on the turntables, according to Leader columnist Dick Peer. Disc jockey Bob Shaddock, who became one of the market's iconic radio personalities, developed the skill of picking up the needle from the 78 RPM records and making announcements while trains passed, according to Peer. The Leader sold the stations in 1953. Though the FM station changed call letters a few times (and frequency once), the stations remained linked until 1997, when owner Sabre Communications sold WCLI to Eolin Broadcasting Inc. While the FM station had a 50,000-watt signal that could be heard throughout the market, WCLI was a Class C local station broadcasting with 1,000 watts on a so-called graveyard frequency. In addition, the ground conductivity was poor at its Denmark Hill tower site, so the AM station could barely be heard at night outside Corning. Late 1980s logo In the 1980s, WCLI was a soft adult contemporary station. In 1990, it switched to talk radio, anchored by The Rush Limbaugh Show. WCLI was among the first stations to sign on as an affiliate of the show. WCLI remained a talk station after the sale to Eolin. However, the terms of the sale called for the rights to broadcast Limbaugh and other popular shows to remain with Sabre. WCLI programming then included Dr. Joy Browne and Bob Grant, along with other shows on the WOR Radio Network. After Eolin assumed management of WENY in Elmira through a local marketing agreement with White Broadcasting, WCLI programming was simulcast on WENY. The latter station, like WCLI, is a class C station. Together, the two stations effectively cover the market. In 2003, Eolin Broadcasting sold all of the stations to Route 81 Radio, based in Hazleton, PA. Route 81 switched WCLI's call letters to WENI in 2004 to make the call letters of its simulcasting stations similar. WENI eventually ended up in the hands of Sound Communications, which by 2018 was an affiliated company with Waypoint Media. In late 2019, Sound and Waypoint struck an agreement to be acquired by Standard Media Group, a sale that will close in early 2020 pending regulatory approval. Programming WENI carries a mostly syndicated lineup. Frankly Speaking with Frank Acomb, a local program, is heard during morning drive time. The station simulcasts local high school sports with WGMM, with Denis Sweeney on play-by-play.

In addition to the many birds which visit, a wide variety of botanical species contribute to the natural offerings. The site is historically significant due to the presence of prehistoric Indian shell middens, mounds composed of discarded oyster shells. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973. It is administered by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. History The shell middens located at Indian Mound Park date to the Mississippian period (1100 to 1550). The mounds were visited throughout this period by Native Americans of the Pensacola culture, who harvested oysters and fished in Little Dauphin Island Sound, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico. Archaeologist Gregory Waselkov of the University of South Alabama believes that the visitors to the island came from Bottle Creek, the largest Mississippian settlement in the area. Waselkov theorizes that Bottle Creek, located on the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, served as the major village while Dauphin Island acted as a migration destination during the winter months. Shell middens at the site. Relatively immune from the unpredictable weather conditions that affect farming, the fish and oysters from the sound were a reliable supply of food that could be immediately consumed or dried for use during later months. The oysters were collected from reefs during low tide conditions. Placed atop heated coals in a pit, the oysters were steamed by covering with seaweed. The cooking technique likely resembled a traditional New England clam bake. The steaming process would also have facilitated easy recovery of the oyster meat since the shells open naturally when heated. For preservation of the oysters, the recovered meat would be treated by smoking. Over the years, the discarded shells accumulated to form the middens. Some have suggested that such waste disposal (dumping) with apparent lack of care is inherent in human behavior, not just a trait of Western civilizations. Spaniards first visited Dauphin Island in 1519. The arrival of Europeans to the region led to the disruption of the Mississippian culture. The Mississippian tribes in the coastal region were replaced by or became the Choctaw and Creek tribes. The Creeks and Seminoles continued to fish and harvest oysters in the area until the 1830s when they were forcibly displaced to the Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. In 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville landed on the island and discovered a large pile of human bones. Based on the discovery, d'Iberville coined the name Massacre Island. The height and serpentine shape of the shell mounds on the north side of the island indicated use or habitation by earlier civilizations. Archaeology Indian Mound Park contains six oyster shell middens of varying sizes. The largest is approximately circular with a recessed bowl in the center of the mound. This midden measures 180 feet (55 m) by 165 feet (50 m) with a height of 3 feet (1 m) to 22 feet (7 m). In the book Stars Fell On Alabama, however, Carl Carmer states that the largest mound rose to a height of 50 feet (15 m) and was composed of layers measuring ten feet (3 m) thick. The structures are archaeologically similar to shell rings found on the coasts of Florida and South Carolina. In 1940 and 1941, a limited archaeological survey was executed on a large prehistoric shell midden on Dauphin Island. More extensive excavations of the site were conducted by archaeologists from the University of South Alabama in 1990. Observation of the mound profile revealed stratification with large layers of oyster shells and thin intervening layers of charcoal, fish bones, and potsherds. The stratified layers are due to the seasonal use of the mounds by various bands of people over a period of centuries. The oyster shells were discarded into the area surrounding the fire used for steaming. As the location of the fire moved each year, a complex pattern of overlapping layers emerged in the form of shell mounds. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation, a mapping team from the University of South Alabama produced a contour map of the shell mounds. Few artifacts were recovered from the site during the excavations. Objects discovered at the location were primarily broken cooking pots. Stone tools were particularly scarce in the region. Wildlife Indian Mound Park exhibits a variety of subtropical plants exceeding that of the other Gulf Coast barrier islands. Likely brought to the area by Native American groups for medicine or culinary purposes, the species include representatives of families from as far inland as the Appalachian Mountains and as far south as the state of Yucat√°n in Mexico. Live oaks on the island may be over 800 years old. They were present at the first visits of Spanish and French explorers. The park is located on the Dauphin Island-Bayou La Batre Loop of the Alabama Coastal Birding Trail. Due to its location on the northern boundary of the Gulf of Mexico, Dauphin Island is a stop for many migrant birds. Up to 384 species of birds have been spotted on the island, including a large variety of shorebirds, long-legged waders, and warblers. The city of Dauphin Island was named America's \\"birdiest\\" small coastal city in both 2005 and 2006. Additionally, migratory butterflies can be spotted at Indian Mound Park.

It is located in the Nahla valley in the district of Akre. In the village, there is a church of Mar Gewargis of the Ancient Church of the East. History After the Assyrian genocide in the First World War, Hezany was resettled by Assyrian Nestorians from Lower Tyari in 1920. The village was divided into Hezany Eletha (upper Hezany) and Hezany Khtetha (lower Hezany). In 1938, lower Hezany was inhabited by 25 people, with 5 families, and upper Hezany had a population of 155, with 28 families, for a total of 180 people, and 33 families. The population of lower Hezany grew to 210, whereas upper Hezany decreased to 44 by the Iraqi census of 1957, for a total of 254 people. At the onset of the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War in 1961, 100 families in 42 houses inhabited the village. During the war, neighbouring Kurds illegally seized 60 dunams of agricultural land, and Hezany was razed by government irregulars in 1964 and 1969. The population subsequently decreased in lower Hezany to 145, and to 20 people in upper Hezany, for a total of 165 people by 1977. The village was destroyed by the Iraqi government in 1987 during the Al-Anfal campaign, displacing the remaining 110 families. Hezany was rebuilt and repopulated by 50 families in the aftermath of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq. Although wholly populated by Assyrians, the Kurdistan Regional Government officially imposed the Kurdish name Hezanke on the village. Villagers reported they had suffered from illegal land expropriation by Kurds in 1994 and 1997. A blockade imposed by Kurdistan Democratic Party militants on Hezany and seven other Assyrian villages in the valley in August 1999 by prohibiting the movement of food into the village, which was dependent on food from Akre, was lifted after the intervention of the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross. In early 2009, 29 displaced Assyrians, with 10 families, inhabited the village. As of 2010, upper Hezany is completely uninhabited and lower Hezany partially uninhabited, despite the construction of houses by the Kurdistan Regional Government, due to the lack of infrastructure and poor economic opportunities. Irrigation channels in the village were restored by the Assyrian Aid Society in May 2013.

Playing career  Ricky \\"Amazing\\" Grace first played college basketball at Midland College, transferring after two years to the University of Oklahoma alongside future NBA player Mookie Blaylock. In 1988, his last year at Oklahoma, Grace helped the Oklahoma Sooners reach the championship game of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, where they were defeated by the Kansas Jayhawks. Selected in the 1988 NBA Draft by the Utah Jazz in the third round (67th overall), he failed to make the active roster of an NBA team. Soon after, Grace was invited by then Perth Wildcats general manager (and 1990 head coach) Cal Bruton to play for the Australian club, where he played his entire professional career, and captained the club from 2002/03 until his retirement. During his time with the club Grace played an integral part in six grand finals appearances and four championships, twice being award Grand Final MVP; first in 1990 when the Wildcats defeated the Brisbane Bullets to claim their first championship, and again in 1993 when the Wildcats were defeated by the Melbourne Tigers. 1991 was filled with more success for Grace, as the Wildcats won back-to-back championships, defeating the Eastside Spectres, and Grace was selected to the All-NBL First Team. In 1993, Grace had a three-game stint with the Atlanta Hawks, where he was reunited with college teammate Mookie Blaylock. Grace (#15) holding up the 1995 NBL Championship trophy In late 1994, Grace became naturalised as an Australian citizen and in March 1995 made his international debut when he was selected for the Australian Boomers in their 5-game series against the touring Magic Johnson All-Stars. 1995 also saw the Wildcats win their 3rd NBL crown, defeating the defending champion North Melbourne Giants in the Grand Final series. As Champions, the Wildcats were invited to participate in the 1995 McDonald's Championship in London. The Wildcats lost to NBA champions the Houston Rockets before defeating Real Madrid in their second match. In 1996, Grace signed a 6-year contract with the Wildcats and was considered unlucky not to gain a place in the Boomers squad for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Four years later he did make it to the Olympics when he was a member of the Boomers squad at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, helping the home country to 4th place. This capped off another successful year for Grace, who won his fourth championship when the Wildcats defeated the Victoria Titans. In the second half of his career, Grace adjusted his game to become more of an offensive threat, and he was rewarded with another All-NBL First Team selection in 2001, 10 years after the first, and again in 2002 and 2003. Despite playing arguably the best basketball of his career, the Wildcats would only make one more grand final series, in 2002/2003, when they were defeated by the Sydney Kings, meaning Grace would fail to equal the then record of Larry Sengstock who won five NBL championships. In 2003 Grace was selected to the NBL's 25th Anniversary Team. He would play for two more seasons, with his last game a loss in an elimination final against the Melbourne Tigers on February 24, 2005. On August 4, 2010, it was announced that Grace is to be inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame (ABHF) at a ceremony on August 18, 2010. Grace was surprised to be inducted as he felt he wouldn't be considered for the Hall of Fame before former teammate James Crawford was.  Post playing career  Currently Grace is the director for the Role Models WA organisation. Role Models WA offers sport and development programs for indigenous communities in Western Australia. Other role models that work alongside Grace include numerous football players from the Fremantle Dockers and West Coast Eagles including Chris Lewis, David Wirrpanda, Des Headland and Daniel Kerr.

Biography  Wang Meng was born in Wuxing (Âê¥ÂÖ¥), now known as Huzhou (ÊπñÂ∑û), Zhejiang. He was a maternal grandson of Zhao Mengfu, thus making him a descendant of the Song Dynasty's royal bloodline on his mother's side. Wang Meng was erroneously accused of conspiring against the Ming Emperor Taizu and spent the last five years of his life in jail.  Painting style  Wang Meng is considered to be one of the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, along with Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, and Ni Zan. They famously refused to serve the Mongolian rulers of their country. In contrast to many renowned painters in previous history, these artists mostly worked on paper instead of silk, an indication of the importance they gave to the calligraphic touch of the brush on paper. They exclusively painted landscapes, which they believed to be the visible key to the invisible reality. They restricted their acquaintanceship to each other, and like-minded \\"wen ren\\" (gentleman-scholars).Lee, Pages 460-463 Wang Meng was the youngest of the group, and the least famous in his own time. Nevertheless, his style greatly influenced later Chinese painting. In contrast to the relatively spare style of his compatriots, his ropy brushstrokes piled one on the other to produce masses of texture combined in dense and involved patterns.Lee, Pages 466-467 Many artists were influenced by the works of Wang Meng centuries after his death, most notably Dong Qichang.Lee, Page 467 His most famous works are the Ge Zhichuan Relocating, Forest Grotto at Juqu, Writing Books under the Pine Trees, The Simple Retreat, and Dwelling in the Qingbian Mountains. Most of his masterpieces are now located in notable museums around the world, such as the Palace Museum, National Palace Museum, Shanghai Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Lee Page 467 In 2011, a lesser known work of his from a private collection, titled Zhichuan Resettlement, was sold for 402.5 million yuan (US$62.1 million) at art auction.http://en.artron.net/news/news.php?newid=171277 File:Wang Meng Writing Books under the Pine Trees 1279-1368 –ö–ª–∏–≤–ª–µ–Ω–¥ –ú–ò.jpgWriting Books under the Pine Trees, Cleveland Museum of Art File:Wang Meng.

In contrast, Yang was only 23 points behind Aun in an effort to knock the Soviet off the medal platform. Kuznetsov was still only a point behind Yang and Herman was not far from them either. { class=wikitable - !rowspan=2 Place rowspan=2 Athlete rowspan=2 Nation rowspan=2 Height colspan=3 Points - !

Emberger was the fastest in the event, but still finished in 10th place overall. Aun, with a 67-point deficit to catch Walde for the silver medal, needed to run approximately 10 seconds faster than the German.

He was born in Sheffield, England on 2 December 1860 to Rev. Brooke Herford and Hannah Hankinson Herford. Oliver's father, Brooke, was a Unitarian minister who moved the family to Chicago in 1876 and to Boston in 1882. Oliver attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio from 1877 to 1879. Later he studied art at the Slade School in London and the Acad√©mie Julien in Paris. Afterward, he moved to New York, where he lived until his death. He has been called \\"The American Oscar Wilde\\". As a frequent contributor to The Mentor, Life, and Ladies' Home Journal, he sometimes signed his artwork as \\"O Herford\\". In 1906 he wrote and illustrated the Little Book of Bores. He also wrote short poems like \\"The Chimpanzee\\" and \\"The Hen\\", as well as writing and illustrating \\"The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten\\" (1904) and \\"Excuse It Please\\" (1930). His sister Beatrice Herford was also a humorist. Ethel Mumford and Addison Mizner wrote a small book, The Cynic's Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1903, as a Christmas present and added Herford's name as an author as a joke. The printer made up more copies to sell and to everyone's surprise it was an astounding success. When Herford found out about it he wanted 90% of the royalties. He was awarded an equal third.Mizner, Addison. The Many Mizners. Chicago: Sears, 1932. p. 186.The New York Times. January 10, 1903 Herford's cartoons and humorous verse appeared in journals such as Life, Woman's Home Companion, Century Magazine, Harper's Weekly, The Masses and Punch. Over 30 books illustrated by Herford, and frequently written by him as well, were published from the 1890s to the 1930s. He also wrote plays and was known for his humorous and pithy bon mots. Herford was a longtime member of the Players Club in New York City. He married Margaret Regan in New York on May 26, 1904. Herford died on July 5, 1935 and his wife died the following December.

He played for the Detroit Tigers for the most significant portion of his career (1923‚Äì32), and later with the Washington Senators (1933‚Äì36), Cleveland Indians (1937‚Äì38), and the Chicago Cubs (1939). Consistently winning in double digits for thirteen years (1924‚Äì36), left- handed Whitehill went on to become one of the top winning pitchers of all time. He was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Major league career \\"The Earl\\", as many called him, was a handsome and often temperamental pitcher who often showed up in the top 10 in hit batsmen, leading the league in his first full year, 1924, when he hit 13 (tied with George Uhle). Whitehill averaged 14 wins each season and he never dipped below 11 wins in a full season (30 starts or more). Whitehill made his debut on September 15, 1923. He was a small left- handed pitcher, who weighed around . With Detroit, he came to be known as one of the most consistent pitchers in the league. From 1928 through 1932, he never had an ERA higher than 4.62 and never had one lower than 4.08; a difference of only .54 in those years. In his rookie season, Whitehill was 17‚Äì8, with a 3.86 ERA, and two shutouts. The Tigers' offensive support helped, as the Tigers finished 1st in most major offensive categories in 1923. Reduced run support became a factor later in his stint with Detroit, which lead some to believe his overall record could have been better. In his early years with Detroit, Whitehill was part of a starting rotation that included Hooks Dauss, Dutch Leonard, and Lil Stoner. Whitehill, one of the top pitchers of the Roaring Twenties, had a celebrity marriage to Violet Geissinger. Geissinger was a model for Sun-Maid Raisins during the 1920s. She was known as The Sun- Maid Raisin Girl. After he was traded to Washington, for Firpo Marberry and Carl Fischer, Whitehill fit right in there, going a career-best 22‚Äì8 in his first year, with a 3.33 ERA (also a career-best, excluding his first year when he pitched in 8 games and had a 2.73 ERA). With Washington that year, he saw his first (and last) postseason action, when the Senators were defeated by the New York Giants in 5 games. However, Whitehill did his part, getting the only win of the series for Washington. In that game, he pitched a complete game shutout allowing 5 hits and 2 walks. Because he didn't start until Game 3, it became his only start of the Series, and his only start of the postseason. Thus, his final postseason ERA was 0.00, tied with many others for a record. He one-hit the St. Louis Browns on July 4, 1932, Goose Goslin recording the only hit for the Browns. Whitehill also one-hit the New York Yankees on May 30, 1934. The Yanks' Ben Chapman broke up the no-hitter in the ninth inning. He was traded as part of a three team deal on December 10, 1936. The Senators received Jack Salveson from the Chicago White Sox, who received Thornton Lee from the Indians, which is where Whitehill was headed. In Cleveland, Whitehill had two average years and made a number of relief appearances (mostly in 1937). His final record with the Indians was 17‚Äì16. Whitehill signed with the Cubs in 1939, went 4‚Äì7 with a 5.14 ERA there, and was released in October 1939. In 17 seasons, he was 218‚Äì185 with a career ERA of 4.36, having given up 1726 earned runs in 3564 innings pitched. He recorded 1350 career strikeouts. He pitched in 541 games, 473 of them starts. His lifetime ERA of 4.36 is higher than any other 200-game winner. A competent hitting pitcher in his 17 years in the majors, Whitehill compiled a .204 batting average (264-for-1291) with 107 runs, 4 home runs, 98 RBI and 97 bases on balls. Later life After serving as a coach for the Indians, the Philadelphia Phillies, and in the International League in the early 1940s, he became a sales representative for the A. G. Spalding sporting goods firm. Whitehill died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident in Omaha, Nebraska, at the age of 55.

The women discover that their boyfriend has been dating all three of them at the same time‚Äîa discovery that leads them on an adventure throughout Los Angeles, California. Plot The movie opens with an animated telling of Tom√°s Fuentes's (Eduardo Ver√°stegui) life, in which he is always surrounded by women. In his current life, he is a representative for the Olivero & Sanchez Marketing Group in Los Angeles and is busy travelling to visit all three of his girlfriends to give them each a gift. Cici (Sof√≠a Vergara), a cocktail waitress from Miami who enjoys being the center of attention; Patricia Sofia Ordonez Coronado del Pescador (Jaci Velasquez), a debutante of New York's high society who is tired of her mother's (Mar√≠a Conchita Alonso) endless attempts to marry her off; and Lorena Morales (Roselyn S√°nchez), a lawyer from Chicago who loves how Tomas makes her feel sexy; have fallen for him and given him the affectionate nickname \\"Papi\\". This love triangle of sorts affects Tom√°s's work life, causing him to pass out during a presentation. His doctor (Ian Gomez) learns of the love triangle, tells Tom√°s to choose only one woman, prescribes tranquilizers and advises against driving, alcohol, and women. By coincidence, all three of his girlfriends go to Los Angeles after hearing their horoscopes read by Walter Mercado, Univision's Primer Impacto fortune teller. The three women arrive at his house while he is at the doctor's. Instead of fighting each other, all three agree to leave and quit Tomas cold turkey as revenge for his cheating on them. In their absence, Tom√°s arrives home and takes his tranquilizers with alcohol. The girls each have second thoughts about leaving and return to confront Tom√°s directly. First Lorena, then Patricia and finally Cici, causing Tom√°s to overdose on alcohol and tranquilizers and pass out again. Mary (Joy Enriquez), Tom√°s' secretary, calls hoping that he is doing better. Outside Tomas' house, FBI agent Carmen Rivera (Lisa Vidal), is waiting. She followed Cici to Los Angeles as part of an investigation. Fala (Diana-Maria Riva), Cici's business partner, had Cici do her boyfriend, Ricky, a favor by taking a car that he sold online to the buyer in Los Angeles. Ricky is involved in the Whittaker counterfeit ring that Agent Rivera is investigating. The girls spot her while panicking about what to do with Tomas and think she is \\"the L.A. woman\\" who just called, probably from a cell phone. Scared by Agent Rivera's firearm, the girls decide to take Tom√°s out of the house and wait until he wakes up and decide which girl he wants to be with. They load all their bags in Ricky's car and, after a short chase, they decide to stay at a Marriott hotel instead of a Motel 6. Unfortunately, Patricia's credit cards have been canceled by her mother. However, Lorena is their saving grace. The Miss Latina American Beauty Pageant is being held in that very same hotel and Miss Puerto Rico's flight was delayed. Lorena bears a resemblance to the real beauty contestant and takes her place. Cici passes herself and Patricia off as her staff. When moving their bags to Miss Puerto Rico's room, a bag falls off the cart onto the luggage room floor. In the hotel room, all three girls have dinner, empty three bottles of champagne and share their life stories with each other. They each then have a dream in which they end up with Tom√°s but feel bad about leaving the other two behind. The next morning, Lorena has to meet the judges and Cici has to deliver Ricky's car to a man named Rodrigo (D.L. Hughley) who apparently bought it. They leave Tom√°s but, in their absence, he's taken by Agent Rivera who has followed them to the hotel. It turns out Rodrigo was not interested in the car but a bag that was supposed to be in the trunk. Upon returning to the hotel with Rodrigo's associate, Victor (Freddy Rodriguez), the girls discover Tom√°s is missing and a note that reads, \\"If you want your Papi back, bring the money to the Don Quixote puppet at L.A. Latin festival at 5 PM. No cops.\\" Patricia knocks Victor out with a lamp and Cici calls Fala in Miami for answers about the car but doesn't get any. All that is left is to do what the note says. They are interrupted by Costas Delgado (Paul Rodriguez, uncredited), the director of the pageant, who has been looking for Lorena and needs her to meet with the judges immediately. Patricia finds the extra bag filled with money in the luggage room and Cici gets a map to the festival. Victor comes to, calls Rodrigo and they plan to catch the girls at the festival. While Miss Mexico is being interviewed, Lorena unbuttons her blouse slightly to show off her cleavage and Costas helps her with her sash. During Lorena's interview, Patricia and Cici arrive but so does the real Miss Puerto Rico (Nicole Scherzinger), who outs Lorena as an impostor. Cici trips her, allowing all three to escape. Outside, Tom√°s wakes up in Agent Rivera's car. Agent Rivera tells him she intends to use him and the girls in order to detain Victor and Rodrigo. They follow the girls to the festival as they leave in Ricky's car. On the way, the girls' car breaks down completely. They steal a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which Patricia knows how to drive, promising the owner to bring it right back and lose both the map and Agent Rivera in another chase. Upon arrival, the girls see the puppet is behind the stage. Running through the crowd to avoid the cops, Patricia loses one of her colored contact lenses. Since she looks \\"so much better without all that money\\", she simply takes the other one out. Victor and Rodrigo spot them and the girls run on stage where Sheila E. is performing and dance to singer Christina Vidal's song, Dejar√©, regardless of their mixed dance backgrounds. Victor and Rodrigo get closer to the stage, causing the girls to run off mid- performance. They all run to the puppet, where Carmen and other FBI agents surround them and apprehend Victor and Rodrigo. Tom√°s is reunited with all three of his girlfriends. He apologizes to them for his deception and is unable to choose between them. The girls, however, have all found their inner strengths and choose to leave him instead. Tom√°s decides to take Agent Carmen's advice and spend some time alone... after taking her out for dinner. Returning to the festival crowds, the girls are invited to return to the stage where they dance to Christina Vidal's song It's All About Nothing. The movie's timeline advances five months later and the girls have kept in touch. Patricia has moved into her own apartment with her dog Fifi and has gotten a job at an art gallery. Cici is an entertainer on a cruise liner with her business partner Fala. Lorena is still a lawyer working pro-bono but puts her time off to good use and becomes the self-proclaimed \\"Queen of Tango\\". Fifi hears her horoscope that advises her to \\"go outside the door because love is waiting for [her].\\" The movie ends with Fifi finding her \\"Puppy Chulo.\\" Cast * Roselyn S√°nchez as Lorena * Sof√≠a Vergara as Cici * Jaci Velasquez as Patricia * Eduardo Ver√°stegui as Tom√°s \\"Papi\\" Fuentes * Lisa Vidal as Carmen * Freddy Rodr√≠guez as Victor * D.L.

Rotten Tomatoes gave it a rating of 14% based on 49 reviews. Accessed 2 September 2009 The film failed to appeal to a mainstream audience beyond its Hispanic demographic. Elizabeth Weitzman from the New York Daily News wrote \\"The credits on this film are genuinely impressive: Each of the talented actresses is already a popular Latina star, and the film was produced by Forest Whitaker, who directed Waiting to Exhale.

The plot revolves around alcohol, being made just prior to prohibition but during a period where the politicians were debating the evils of alcohol. Synopsis Chaplin plays a drunkard who is attending a hydropathic hotel, presumably to dry out, but brings along a big suitcase full of alcohol. He gets trapped in a spinning revolving door then traps the foot of a large man with a bandaged foot, suffering from gout. He encounters a beautiful young woman and sits between her and a man who keeps offering him the spa water (which he keeps pouring away). The girl encourages him to stop drinking. He meets the big man again who tries to get the hotel manager to throw him out. Instead he gets taken for a Turkish massage. When the hotel owner learns employees are getting drunk from Charlie's liquor, he orders one man to throw the liquor out the window. The drunk employee hurls the bottles through the window, straight into the spa's health waters. Meanwhile Charlie is not happy to be massaged by the large man in the bath house and tries to dodge this. Outside, the well is contaminated with alcohol, sending the spa's inhabitants into a dancing stupor. Chaplin, encouraged by his new love to get sober, drinks from the spurious spa, gets drunk and offends her. She leaves him in anger and walks away. Charlie walks back to the door unsteadily, when he bumps into the large man, tripping him off his wheel chair and landing him into the alcoholic well. The next morning there are plenty of hangovers, but Chaplin turns sober, walks out and finds the lady. Realizing what had happened, she forgives him. They walk ahead, just then he accidentally steps into the liquor-laden well. Alternative Version An alternative introduction which was added to the film (during prohibition) explains that in 1917 drunkenness was a serious problem in the working class, so to keep it funny Chaplin changed from his \\"Little Tramp\\" character to an upper-class fop. Gout was at the time believed to be a disease of the wealthy, which is why Eric Campbell's character has it. Chaplin as bellhop Clips from the documentary Unknown Chaplin show that Chaplin originally cast himself as a bellhop at the spa and shot at least one scene with him in that role.

Chaplin eventually discarded the idea, instead casting himself as a patient at the health spa. Reviews A reviewer from the Louisville Herald praised the film, writing, \\"It's a cinch that as long as pictures like The Cure are offered to make folks forget their troubles, Chaplin will always be worth the money he gets.\\" Similarly, a reviewer from Variety noted, \\"The Cure is a whole meal of laughs, not merely giggles, and ought to again emphasize that fact that Charlie is in a class by himself.\\" The reviewer from Motion Picture World declared The Cure \\"contains in the second reel some excruciatingly funny moments, particularly in the scenes at the baths.\\" Sound version In 1932, Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplin's Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures. Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release.SilentComedians entry Preservation status On September 4, 2013 a missing part of the end of the film was found and will be released on a future DVD.

A distinctive element of the Sapphires was the traditional Armstrong Siddeley V-shaped radiator grille with the Sphinx motif mounted on it. On some models the sphinx sported aircraft wings carrying tiny Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire jet engines.  Sapphire 234  The Sapphire 234 and 236 were two cars identical in appearance but sold with different engines having different performance characteristics. The 234 could be purchased with wire wheels as an optional extra. The 234 was produced from 1955 to 1958 and used a four- cylinder 2,290 cc version of the 346 engine. The transmission was a manual four-speed gearbox with optional overdrive. A 100 mph car intended for the man who liked high performance.Britain's New Cars On Show At Earls Court.

Sapphire 236  The 236 was made between 1955 and 1957 and used the six- cylinder 2,310 cc engine previously seen in the Armstrong Siddeley Whitley. A conventional manual gearbox was available but many were fitted with a Lockheed Manumatic \\"clutchless\\" transmission. Overdrive was an option on either transmission. This car with an 85 mph maximum was intended to be a quiet, flexible, easy-to-drive saloon. 603 were produced.  Sapphire 346  The 346 was the first of the Sapphires introduced late in 1952 for sale in 1953 and continuing until 1958. The six-cylinder 3,435 cc engine had hemi-spherical combustion chambers and could have optional twin Stromberg carburettors(¬£25 extra) which increased the output from 125 to 150 bhp (93 to 112 kW) giving a top speed in excess of . The front suspension was independent coil springs with a rigid axle and leaf springs at the rear. The Girling hydraulic brakes used drums all round. The body was available as a four- or six-light (two or three windows on each side) at the same cost and with either a bench or individual front seats. The seats were finished in leather, with the dashboard and door-cappings in walnut veneer. A heater was standard. It was introduced with the choice of a Wilson electrically- controlled finger-tip four-speed pre-selector gearbox as a ¬£30 option, or four-speed synchromesh gearbox. It became available with automatic transmission (Rolls Royce four-speed) with the introduction of the Mark II in 1954. A long-wheelbase model was launched in 1955 as a limousine version which had the pre-selector gearbox as standard, however, there was an optional four- speed manual column-change gearbox available. It featured a longer wheelbase (extended by 21 inches or 535 mm) chassis with a body incorporating a limousine division. Models for export to the U.S. were always delivered with twin carburettors.Robert Penn Bradly: The Original 346 Sapphire explored to great depth; Limula Pty Ltd, Bardwell Park, NSW, Australia, 2008.

Though little changed externally, the radiator grille no longer rose to the top of the bonnet, many refinements were incorporated. The six-cylinder engine was enlarged more than 16% to 3,990 cc with larger twin Stromberg carburettors as standard and power output increased to [SAE] 165 bhp (167 hp, 123 kW), or [DIN] 145 bhp (147 hp, 108 kW). Perhaps more important was an increase of nearly 30% in torque at 50 m.p.h. Big end and main bearings were now made of lead indium and a vibration damper fitted to the nose of the crankshaft. The compression ratio was raised to 7.5 to 1. The car could now lap the Lindley high speed track at 104 m.p.h. Interior of the Star Sapphire saloon Various suspension modifications had been carried out. Servo-assisted Girling disc brakes were now installed on the front wheels and Burman recirculating ball power steering was standardised with a turning circle reduced by 4'6\\". A BorgWarner type DG automatic gearbox was fitted which incorporated a lever on the facia to hold intermediate gear at 35, 45, 55, and 65 m.p.h. Door hinges were now concealed and the front doors now hinged at their leading edge. There was an independent heater for the rear passengers and demisting slots for the rear window. All features were standard, the provision of alternatives being believed to lead to an unsatisfactory compromise. 902 saloons were produced, as well as 77 long-wheelbase cars, 73 of which were built as limousines (including 2 prototypes). The limousine version was made in 1960 only and had a single-carburettor engine and manual gearbox (the automatic gearbox was fitted to 12 examples). The remaining 4 chassis were used for 3 hearses and an ambulance. 980 Star Sapphires were produced.

The class has a long history beginning with races on Sydney Harbour, Australia in 1892 and later in New Zealand. The boat has changed significantly since the early days, bringing in new technology as it became available. Because of the need of strength, agility and skill, the class is considered to be the top level of small boat sailing. In Australia this boat is called the \\"Aussie 18\\" due to its inherent connections to Australia. It is the fastest conventional non- foiling monohull on the yardstick rating, with a score of 675, coming only third after the Tornado and Inter 20 (Both multihulls).  History  The 18 ft Skiff has come a long way in more than 100 years of continuous development.See section 16.10 of From heavy boats carrying a crew of ten or more, to today's high-tech, light-weight, high performance design. Parts of the history of the early days of skiff sailing, between 1892 and 1945, is found on the pages of the Australian 18 Footers League.  The modern 18 ft Skiff  Today there are two modern hull designs racing. The \\"International 18\\" is based on a design by Iain Murray, while the B18 was designed by Julian Bethwaite. The Australian 18 Footer League allows only the International 18, with the annual JJ Giltinan International Trophy contended with the one design Murray hull. The European Class Association allows both designs to compete against each other. Although there are differences in the sailing aspects of the two designs, their measurements are very close, with a waterline length of 18 ft (5.49 m) and an average beam of 6 to 8 feet (1.83 to 2.44 m), not including the wings. With wings the maximum beam is 14 feet for the \\"International 18\\" and 18 feet for Open 18's sailed at Sydney Flying Squadron and Skiffs Australia. When the boat is dry it should weigh not less than 375 lb (170 kg) including wings, foils (centreboard and rudder) and the number one rig of sails, spars and ropes. In the 1980s and '90s wings were widened to the extreme ‚Äì some boats having maximum beam of 29 feet. Such wings proved unmanageable, with the crews too much on the brink of disaster for consistent success. While true 18' skiffs have no sail area or mast height limitations, the limit that the 18 footer League has specified for their one-design sub class is a maximum mast height of 33 ft (10 m), truly powerful on an 18' hull. The entire rig, which supports sails with unlimited area, is currently controlled by three trapezing crew members. The boat will plane upwind starting at a true windspeed of about 8 knots, depending on sea conditions and off the wind can reach speeds that doubles the true windspeed. This is possible through the very high sail-carrying power to total weight ratio, which is above 30% with the no. 1 rig and approaches 40% with the no. 3 rig (for reference, a 30% ratio is needed to plane upwind and a 10% ratio is needed to plane at all. Most cruising boats have a ratio under 5%). In Australia, there is a fleet of approximately 20‚Äì25 18 Foot Skiffs at the \\"League\\" club in Sydney. Sydney's other traditional 18 Foot Skiff club, the Sydney Flying Squadron, has a small fleet and there are several boats in the state of Queensland. In New Zealand the class following is smaller but reached its zenith in the 1970s when most designs were by Bruce Farr. The 18 ft skiff is not without its dangers. The high speed makes it hard to handle and requires extremely fast reflexes and a broad awareness of your surroundings in order to anticipate changes. Major accidents can occur with inexperienced and experienced sailors alike. The 18 ft skiff is currently one of the fastest monohulls on the water. With its massive sail-plan of over 100 square metres on the no. 1 rig and three crew members on trapeze it can outperform nearly every monohull on the water. It combines extreme speeds with an element of danger and is thought by many to be one of the biggest spectacles in sailing. Each year the JJ Giltinan International Trophy is contested on Sydney Harbour to decide the de facto world champion of the class. Typically the event was dominated by Australia and occasionally won by New Zealand, but in recent years entrants such as the USA's Howie Hamlin have taken out the title, displaying the classes growing international appeal. Design history  The first flying 18 footers were either carvel or clinker built with multiple steam bent frames. Cotton sails were used and spars were solid wood. The crew number varied according to the wind strength, often with a boy carried to bail out water. Initial designs were conventional displacement shapes with emphasis on narrow waterlines. In the early 1950s The Sydney boats put emphasis on carrying large extra sails down wind called ringtails. These were set outside the main with light spars top and bottom. They were carried in addition to spinnakers. In very light conditions watersails were carried under the main boom. The most revolutionary boat of this period was the lightweight boat Result, from New Zealand, which was cold moulded with 2 skins of Kahikatea glued together and nailed to lightweight Mangeao bent steamed frames every 21 1/2 inches. At 6 ft 3inches Result was narrower than the conventional boats but still had the same full bow sections typical of the displacement style boats. Result had spaceframes of wood to support the mast and centreboard. In any breeze over 10 knots it was faster than any previous 18s because of its planing ability. From this period increased knowledge and understanding of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, coupled to the availability of plywood and reliable waterproof glues saw dramatic changes. Clinker and carvel construction was dropped and glued up hollow pear shaped masts became standard. By the late 1960s a greater understanding of the science behind planning saw hulls made with increasingly less rocker, very fine forward with very flat aft sections. Once trapezes were introduced the number of crew dropped to 4 by the early 70s and then to 3. Designs became wider, especially aft. As speeds increased so did capsizes, so an effort was made to install built in buoyancy and some self draining capabilities with transom flaps, venturi floor drains built in tanks, especially forward and false floors. Foils became more hydrodynamic, especially after the availability of tank test models. Wood was dropped as a foil material in the 1980s and replaced by stiffer synthetic materials such as fibreglass then kevlar and carbon fibre. By 1970 hollow wooden spars were replaced by tapered aluminium of much smaller section and lighter weight. These in turn were replaced by much stiffer and lighter carbon fibre masts in the 1990s. Sail area got progressively larger especially when wings were added. This enabled small crews to sail with extremely large sails in stronger wind strengths. As most boats were sponsored they could have multiple rigs to match the wind strength. Other modern features are carbon fibre prods (bowsprits) supported by bob stays, dolphin strikers and bow struts. This enabled quicker setting and dropping of the large downwind sails. Huge spinnakers could be set quickly by having halyards geared by mini blocks running internally in the mast. Dacron sails were replaced by much lighter stiffer less porous material such as mylar plastic. Weights of the bare hulls dropped quickly when New Zealand designer Bruce Farr, using his experience in Moth and Cherub designs used thin 3mm ply supported by multiple lightweight stringers and stiffened with tissue fibreglass. These were quickly followed by foam and fibreglass hulls first designed by Russell Bowler. Bare hulls weigh 120 lbs but are very strong with the use of carbon and kevlar to locally reinforce mast steps, centreboard cases, chain plates and wing attachment points. Rudders were placed 500mm aft of the hull to give more control in extreme planing conditions when only the last few feet of the hull was in contact with the water. With very wide tube and net decks up to 29 feet wide modern boats can carry very large powerful square-headed mainsails that have the controls to twist the head of the main in gusts to de-power. Flying 18 footers can now regularly exceed the actual wind speed when planing on all points of sailing. These innovations have made the skiffs very fast but very expensive to build. In New Zealand this has seen the class decline dramatically as top sailors were attracted into the more conventional one design Olympic classes.  Revival of early designs  In Sydney and Brisbane Australia there has been a revival of the early days of 18‚Äô skiff sailing. Replicas of famous 18‚Äô skiffs from the period of 1930 through to 1950 have been built using original techniques, including wooden hulls and spars, gaff rigs, several-piece spinnaker poles and unrestricted sail area. These boats race under the rules of the Australian Historical Skiff Association, which bans wings, trapezes, cleats for controlling ropes for the mainsail, jib and spinnaker, and most of the other modern equipment which makes sailing easier. The class has proved very popular with former sailors of modern 18‚Äô skiffs who, to quote a class champion John Winning, are looking for a challenge because ‚Äúthe modern boats have become too easy to sail‚Äù. The historical 18‚Äô skiffs have a crew of between 6 and 9, which often leaves an opportunity for visiting sailors to have a ride. The AHSSA website listed below has more details.

Once a drug enters into systemic circulation by absorption or direct administration, it must be distributed into interstitial and intracellular fluids. Each organ or tissue can receive different doses of the drug and the drug can remain in the different organs or tissues for a varying amount of time.Carmine Pascuzzo Lima. Farmacocin√©tica III:Distribuci√≥n Available on (in Spanish). Visited 10 January 2009 The distribution of a drug between tissues is dependent on vascular permeability, regional blood flow, cardiac output and perfusion rate of the tissue and the ability of the drug to bind tissue and plasma proteins and its lipid solubility. pH partition plays a major role as well. The drug is easily distributed in highly perfused organs such as the liver, heart and kidney. It is distributed in small quantities through less perfused tissues like muscle, fat and peripheral organs. The drug can be moved from the plasma to the tissue until the equilibrium is established (for unbound drug present in plasma). The concept of compartmentalization of an organism must be considered when discussing a drug‚Äôs distribution. This concept is used in pharmacokinetic modelling. This process is explained as following :- 1\\\\. Initial phage :- 2\\\\. Drug distribution :- 3\\\\. Redistribution :-  Factors that affect distribution  There are many factors that affect a drug's distribution throughout an organism, but Pascuzzo considers that the most important ones are the following: an organism's physical volume, the removal rate and the degree to which a drug binds with plasma proteins and / or tissues. = Physical volume of an organism = This concept is related to multi-compartmentalization. Any drugs within an organism will act as a solute and the organism's tissues will act as solvents. The differing specificities of different tissues will give rise to different concentrations of the drug within each group. Therefore, the chemical characteristics of a drug will determine its distribution within an organism. For example, a liposoluble drug will tend to accumulate in body fat and water-soluble drugs will tend to accumulate in extracellular fluids. The volume of distribution (VD) of a drug is a property that quantifies the extent of its distribution. It can be defined as the theoretical volume that a drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it currently is in blood plasma. It can be determined from the following formula: Vd = \\\\frac {Ab}{Cp}\\\\, Where: Ab is total amount of the drug in the body and Cp is the drug's plasma concentration. As the value for Ab is equivalent to the dose of the drug that has been administered the formula shows us that there is an inversely proportional relationship between Vd and Cp. That is, that the greater Cp is the lower Vd will be and vice versa. It therefore follows that the factors that increase Cp will decrease Vd. This gives an indication of the importance of knowledge relating to the drug's plasma concentration and the factors that modify it. If this formula is applied to the concepts relating to bioavailability, we can calculate the amount of drug to administer in order to obtain a required concentration of the drug in the organism ('loading dose): Dc = \\\\frac {Vd . Cp}{Da . B} This concept is of clinical interest as it is sometimes necessary to reach a certain concentration of a drug that is known to be optimal in order for it to have the required effects on the organism (as occurs if a patient is to be scanned). = Removal rate = A drug's removal rate will be determined by the proportion of the drug that is removed from circulation by each organ once the drug has been delivered to the organ by the circulating blood supply. This new concept builds on earlier ideas and it depends on a number of distinct factors: * The drugs characteristics, including its pKa. * Redistribution through an organism's tissues: Some drugs are distributed rapidly in some tissues until they reach equilibrium with the plasma concentration. However, other tissues with a slower rate of distribution will continue to absorb the drug from the plasma over a longer period. This will mean that the drug concentration in the first tissue will be greater than the plasma concentration and the drug will move from the tissue back into the plasma. This phenomenon will continue until the drug has reached equilibrium over the whole organism. The most sensitive tissue will therefore experience two different drug concentrations: an initial higher concentration and a later lower concentration as a consequence of tissue redistribution. * Concentration differential between tissues. * Exchange surface. * Presence of natural barriers. These are obstacles to a drug's diffusion similar to those encountered during its absorption. The most interesting are: ** Capillary bed permeability, which varies between tissues. ** Blood-brain barrier: this is located between the blood plasma in the cerebral blood vessels and the brain's extracellular space. The presence of this barrier makes it hard for a drug to reach the brain. ** Placental barrier: this prevents high concentrations of a potentially toxic drug from reaching the foetus. = Plasma protein binding = Some drugs have the capacity to bind with certain types of proteins that are carried in blood plasma. This is important as only drugs that are present in the plasma in their free form can be transported to the tissues. Drugs that are bound to plasma proteins therefore act as a reservoir of the drug within the organism and this binding reduces the drug's final concentration in the tissues. The binding between a drug and plasma protein is rarely specific and is usually labile and reversible. The binding generally involves ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces and, less often, covalent bonds. This means that the bond between a drug and a protein can be broken and the drug can be replaced by another substance (or another drug) and that, regardless of this, the protein binding is subject to saturation. An equilibrium also exists between the free drug in the blood plasma and that bound to proteins, meaning that the proportion of the drug bound to plasma proteins will be stable, independent of its total concentration in the plasma. In vitro studies carried out under optimum conditions have shown that the equilibrium between a drug's plasmatic concentration and its tissue concentration is only significantly altered at binding rates to plasma proteins of greater than 90%. Above these levels the drug is \\"sequestered\\", which decreases its presence in tissues by up to 50%. This is important when considering pharmacological interactions: the tissue concentration of a drug with a plasma protein binding rate of less than 90% is not going to significantly increase if that drug is displaced from its union with a protein by another substance. On the other hand, at binding rates of greater than 95% small changes can cause important modifications in a drug's tissue concentration. This will, in turn, increase the risk of the drug having a toxic effect on tissues. Perhaps the most important plasma proteins are the albumins as they are present in relatively high concentrations and they readily bind to other substances. Other important proteins include the glycoproteins, the lipoproteins and to a lesser degree the globulins. It is therefore easy to see that clinical conditions that modify the levels of plasma proteins (for example, hypoalbuminemias brought on by renal dysfunction) may affect the effect and toxicity of a drug that has a binding rate with plasma proteins of above 90%. Redistribution Highly lipid- soluble drugs given by intravenous or inhalation methods are initially distributed to organs with high blood flow. Later, less vascular but more bulky tissues (such as muscle and fat) take up the drug‚Äîplasma concentration falls and the drug is withdrawn from these sites. If the site of action of the drug was in one of the highly perfused organs, redistribution results in termination of the drug action. The greater the lipid solubility of the drug, the faster its redistribution will be. For example, the anaesthetic action of thiopentone is terminated in a few minutes due to redistribution. However, when the same drug is given repeatedly or continuously over long periods, the low-perfusion and high-capacity sites are progressively filled up and the drug becomes longer-acting.

Early life Born in the southern Italian community of Cosenza, Calabria in 1936, Pasquale immigrated to Toronto in 1958 at the age of 22, arriving alone with only a few dollars in his pocket. He was intensely passionate about music, most specifically Opera. Pasquale met his wife Evelina, a Soprano Singer of Italian descent, in 1964. They had two daughters together, Beatrice and Lisa. Cooking career Pasquale began his career in cooking as a dishwasher and prep cook at several restaurants located around the city of Toronto. With his dedication and talent for food, Chef Pasquale eventually became a chef and later a restaurateur. While continuing to progress his cooking career Pasquale studied opera at the Royal Conservatory of Music. Television Pasquale's original cooking show was played on Toronto public access television in the late 1970s. He hosted \\"La Cucina Italiana con Pasquale\\" on CHIN television during Johnny Lombardi's Sunday Italian programming. Later Pasquale was the host of popular cooking shows in the 1980s and early 1990s by the names of Pasquale's Kitchen and Pasquale's Kitchen Express. His trademark outfit was a blue smock, a white necktie and a red chef's toque. The show was focused around the colourful Pasquale engaging the audience in his cooking while singing at the same time. The food prepared on the show was for the most part Italian, usually consisting of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The episode would usually end with Pasquale being the gracious host pouring wine and serving his delicious dinner to a lucky audience member. Technique Pasquale's cooking technique focused on quick full multi-course meals. In different episodes he quoted a different time allotted for his four-course meal: 18.5 minutes to 22 minutes. The meals were composed of several dishes: one for carbohydrate (usually pasta or risotto), another for protein (chicken, meat, or fish), and two of each of an appetizer (e.g., frittata), a dessert, a soup, or salad. The meat dish is usually made using a pan-grilled method: grilling the meat on both sides in a little olive oil, then adding the sauce composed of chopped vegetables (such as mushrooms, potatoes, zucchini, onions, garlic, parsley, and celery, which are steam sauteed in a separate pan), then adding either 35% cream or tomato paste. The sauce was always added to the meat pan, so in the process deglazing it. The pasta/rice dish was made with a similar sauce, but the pasta/rice added to the sauce instead of the other way round. In both sauces, he would add broth from a pan beside the stove top. On rare occasions, Pasquale would use the oven, for example, when cooking roast veal, rigatoni, or foccacia bread. Quotations Pasquale would often repeat certain quotes while he cooked, such as: *If you sing to the food, then it will come out good. *The pasta should not wait for the sauce, the sauce can wait for the pasta. *Watch out for your eye lashes when you flambee. *When a little girl would flip the frittata successfully, she is ready to be courted to get married. *Do not use milk in the sauce instead of 35% cream, otherwise we make ricotta. *The best cooking is what the mama cooks *If the pasta stays for a long time in the boiling water, it will become polenta *Excuse my back (he always says it when turning around to drain the pasta). *You want some more? (usually when he is adding cheese to the pasta or rice dish, then adds some more, then either pours the entire container of cheese, or puts it aside saying you can add to your dish). *May everyone in the world, specially the little ones [i.e. children], have a meal like this *Mamma mia! We should say Pap√† mio sometimes. *I believe cooking is art, fantasy and vocation. *You can repeat a recipe, but I cannot repeat a recipe. *There are three things in the world you cannot repeat exactly the same: sing a song, sign your name, and a recipe. Legacy Pasquale's fame is due greatly to the fact that he was one of the first celebrity chefs in Canada. Known as the Singing Chef, Pasquale once said :Carpino, known as Singing Chef, dead at 69, Timmins Daily Press (ON). Entertainment, Tuesday, January 3, 2006, p. B5.

He currently resides in San Francisco, California. His music has been compared to that of Brian Wilson, Velvet Underground, Nick Drake and Leonard Cohen. Musical career Kelley Stoltz was born in New York City in 1971 and grew up in Birmingham, Michigan. He moved to New York City in his early twenties. While living in New York in the mid 1990s, Stoltz served as an intern with Jeff Buckley's management company where he worked as a \\"fan-mail\\" sorter. In the late 1990s he relocated to San Francisco and began his own musical career. Stoltz recorded his first album The Past Was Faster in 1999, released on Telegraph Records. Stoltz self-released his second album Antique Glow in 2001. The original release was 300 vinyl LPs in hand-painted sleeves. Later the album gained wider distribution when it was released by Jackpine Social Club in the US, Beautiful Happiness in the UK and Raoul Records in Australia. His next project was recorded in the last week of 2001: a track by track cover of Echo & the Bunnymen's Crocodiles album recorded on his 8-track tape recorder. In late 2003, Stoltz toured Australia for the first time and recorded a 4 track direct to disc EP at Corduroy Records. In 2004, Mojo Magazine gave Antique Glow a four (out of five) star review and featured an article on Stoltz in their \\"Mojo Rising\\" column. In 2005, Stoltz signed to Sub Pop and released \\"The Sun Comes Through\\" EP. He also toured Europe in April and Australia for a second time in Dec 2005-January 2006. His first full-length release for Sub Pop, entitled \\"Below the Branches\\", was released in February 2006. In tandem with the release of \\"Below the Branches\\" was an industry first: \\"Below the Branches\\" was the first record in history to make an on- package claim about renewable energy use with the Green-e logo. Stoltz tracked his electricity use and with the help of the Green-e program, offset the all the electricity used to record his record with green tags from the Bonneville Environmental Foundation. In Kelley's words: ‚ÄúUsing renewable energy to offset the electricity I needed to power my guitar amps and my recording machines was a simple and effective way for me to do something about my impact on the environment. Green-e certifies that I am buying 100 percent renewable energy. Hopefully, people will see their logo; check into what they do, and make renewable energy a part of their lives, too.\\" Stoltz and his band were the opening support band for The Raconteurs, on their July and August 2006 tour. Stoltz also performed at the 2006 Lollapalooza in Chicago. His song \\"Birdies Singing\\" from \\"Below the Branches\\" has been used by Volvo for the Volvo C30 commercial in Sweden in 2007; it has also been used for the Regions Financial ad campaign of 2007 in the U.S. Stoltz's song, \\"Memory Collector\\" is featured in a Marriott Hotels ad, and several of his songs were used in the hit FX series, \\"Damages.\\" In early 2006, Stoltz produced God's Boat, the debut album from The Passionistas, which was released on June 5, 2007. He also produced or worked on other Bay Area albums: Oh Sees - Sucks Blood, Bart Davenport - Palaces, Moore Brothers - Aptos and Colossal Yes - Charlemagne's Big Thaw. On February 5, 2008 Stoltz's album Circular Sounds was released by Sub Pop. In 2010 he opened for his heroes Echo & the Bunnymen on a North American Tour after the scheduled opening group was waylaid by the 2010 Icelandic volcano eruption. In October 2010 Sub Pop released Stoltz's album To Dreamers. Stoltz also appeared on Sonny Smith's Sonny and the Sunsets album Tomorrow is Alright. In 2012, Kelley played keyboards, along with members of the Fresh & Onlys, in the backing band to songwriter Rodriguez during a string of live concerts. In September 2013, Double Exposure was released on Third Man Records. He and his band served as opening act for Jack White on his Lazaretto tour. After recording an EP and a further album under a pseudonym, Stoltz's next proper album, In Triangle Time, was released in November 2015. Stoltz played rhythm guitar in Echo & the Bunnymen on their UK, European and USA tours 2016-2018. Released \\"Que Aura\\" on Castle Face Records August 12, 2017.

It is part of the local government area and is approximately 90 km north of Sydney, 55 km south of Newcastle and 6 km west of the Pacific Ocean. History The area now known as Kanwal was a subdivision of Warnervale. Kanwal is said to mean \\"snakes indeed\\" in a local Aboriginal language. Tuggerah Lake as viewed from Craigie Park. The Entrance is also visible in the distant background. Landmarks The dominating feature of Kanwal is the Wyong Rugby League Club to the northeast of the suburb. It is home to the Wyong Roos, a rugby league football club, three sporting ovals, two netball courts and a youth and community centre. There are several parks in Kanwal including Craigie Park to the east facing onto Tuggerah Lake, a wetland area to the northwest and another sporting oval to the south separate from the Rugby League Club. Other landmarks in the area include a small shopping village, a primary school, three aged care facilities, four buildings of religious worship and a caravan park. Transport The area is serviced by four regular bus routes, operating between Lake Haven Shopping Centre and Wyong railway station or Westfield Tuggerah. All four routes split up in different directions at Kanwal, two servicing the northern and western areas and the other two servicing eastern and southern areas together. The Newcastle and Central Coast railway line that services some of Sydney, the Central Coast and most of Newcastle passes close by at Warnervale. Warnervale railway station lies approximately 4 km to the west of Kanwal and one of the bus routes mentioned passes it several times a day. However, Wyong railway station also lies approximately 6 km to the southwest, is serviced by all four bus routes frequently and has more train services operating from it, including the CountryLink service. Politics Kanwal belongs to the Australian electoral division of Dobell that covers approximately 952 km¬≤ and is named after the prominent Australian sculptor and painter Sir William Dobell. In the federal election of 2004 Kanwal contributed 2,652 of the 75,398 votes in the division and saw Ken Ticehurst of the Liberal Party receive 1,108 of them (45.86%), followed by David Mehan of the Australian Labor Party with 979 votes (40.52%) and Scott Ian Rickard of the Australian Greens party with 111 votes (4.59%). Ken Ticehurst went on to win the seat of Salmon for the second time in a row after the election of 2001 with 42,151 of the 75,398 votes (55.90%). Kanwal is also a part of the Electoral district of Wyong and in the state election of 2003 contributed 3008 out of 46,884 total votes in the electoral district. Paul Crittenden of the Australian Labor Party received 1,598 of the votes (53.13%), followed by Ben Morton of the Liberal Party with 984 votes (32.71%) and Scott Ian Rickard of the Australian Greens party with 128 votes (4.26%). Paul Crittenden went on to win the election with a total of 24,644 (53.82%) votes. Notes References * RP Data property reports. Free suburb profile (Kanwal) * Domain.

Prominent black activists and white progressives called for a national conference to discuss African American civil rights. They met to address the social, economic, and political rights of African Americans. This gathering served as the predecessor to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which was formally named during the second meeting in May 1910. Origins In early September 1908 American socialist William English Walling published an article, \\"Race War in the North\\" in The Independent. He described the massive white race riot directed at Black residents in Springfield, Illinois, hometown of late President Abraham Lincoln. The riot had resulted in seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against mostly African Americans who had tried to defend their homes. Walling concluded by saying that a powerful body of citizens needed to come to the aid of blacks in the United States. Mary Ovington wrote to Walling about her interest in this subject and met with him at his apartment in New York City, along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The three decided to organize a national conference on the civil and political rights of African Americans, to be held in New York on the centennial of Lincoln's birthday, February 12, 1909. They issued a call to progressives, and many people responded. They formed the National Negro Committee, which held its first meeting in New York on May 31 and June 1, 1909, at the Henry Street Settlement House on the Lower East Side. The group leaders initially tried to get the famous Booker T. Washington to attend meetings to gain popularity. Although Oswald G. Villard, the grandson of William Lloyd Garrison and one of the founders, was fed up with Washington ignoring \\"the real injustices\\" that affected African Americans, Villard knew that inviting him would help the organization gain momentum. Villard told Washington that the organization would avoid allying with either the more radical activists and scholars such as W. E. B. Du Bois or the conservatism of Black Tuskegee activists, but attempt to benefit all African Americans. He nonetheless clarified that the organization would be a \\"radical political movement.\\" Washington refused to attend, out of fear of ensuing Southern controversy, a concern of ruining the tone of the meeting, and a desire to avoid agitation. The Committee was not overly bothered by his absence, as Villard was more interested in attracting those like Du Bois to shake up Washington's widespread conservatism. The meetings sparked tensions with Washington and his supporters. Many of the Committee's members had been part of the Niagara Movement, which had had notoriously poor relations with Washington. The meetings also lacked many of Washington's allies, such as Andrew Carnegie, who pointedly did not attend. The Committee generated a fair amount of controversy, with some fearing that it would dramatically worsen race relations, and others expressing concern over its \\"political emphasis.\\" Many claimed the Conference was \\"anti-Washingtonian.\\" Nevertheless, the organizers continued on. The attendance of both Black and white activists was a positive indicator of a \\"successful cooperation of the races.\\" The meetings covered topics including social and economic issues, voting rights, physiological differences between races, lynching, and education. The June 1st meeting brought about disputes between white members and Black members, who expressed a lack of trust in their white counterparts. This tension was partly due to the resurgence of the issue of courting Washington's support, this time in the context of including him in a steering committee to appeal to potential white donors. The committee was eventually formed without Washington. It also overlooked more radical members such as Ida B. Wells (although she was later included in the committee), who were not chosen in favor of more moderate members, which caused more argument. During the debates of the evening, white leaders were generally patronizing towards Black members, as Ovington herself acknowledged: > I find myself still occasionally forgetting that the Negroes aren't poor > people for whom I must kindly do something, and then comes a gathering such > as that last evening and I learn they are men with most forceful opinions of > their own. Willard even went so far as to suggest the formation of a separate group with less \\"trying\\" members. Du Bois was the eventual savior of the evening, as he managed to win over the whites. He later recounted the evening as \\"warm and passionate,\\" and described a woman who stood up and \\"cried in passionate, almost tearful earnestness - an earnestness born of bitter experience - 'They are betraying us again - these white friends of ours.'\\" Following more discussion, the committee eventually came to a resolution: > We agree fully with the prevailing opinion that the transformation of the > unskilled colored laborers in industry and agriculture into skilled workers > is of vital importance to that race and to the nation, but we demand for the > Negroes as for all others a free and complete education, whether by city, > state, or nation, a grammar school and industrial training for all, and > technical, professional and academic education for the most gifted. Washington was, unsurprisingly, unhappy with the committee's more radical stance. The resolution also drew scathing criticism from large publications, who expressed fears of a \\"socialist revolution\\" sparked by \\"More Fool Negroes.\\" By May 1910, the National Negro Committee and attendees at its second conference organized a permanent body known as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

He played in the National Hockey League with the Tampa Bay Lightning, Vancouver Canucks and the Washington Capitals. Pettinger was born in Edmonton, Alberta and raised in Victoria, British Columbia. Playing career As a youth, Pettinger played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Victoria, British Columbia. Pettinger was drafted in the 2nd round, 43rd overall, by the Washington Capitals in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft. Before his professional career, Pettinger played a season and half for the University of Denver Pioneers before joining the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League (WHL) midway through the 1999‚Äì00 season. He spent his first few seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) splitting time between the Washington Capitals and their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Portland Pirates, before earning a full-time roster spot with the Capitals in 2003‚Äì04. Pettinger played eight games for HDD Olimpija Ljubljana in Slovenia during the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, then recorded a career-high 20 goals, 18 assists and 38 points as NHL play resumed the following season. On February 26, 2008, at the trade deadline, Pettinger was dealt from the Washington Capitals to the Vancouver Canucks for forward Matt Cooke. Beginning the 2008‚Äì09 season back in the AHL with the Canucks' minor league affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, Pettinger was claimed on re-entry waivers by the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 21, 2008. He completed the season with 15 points in 59 games with the Lightning. Unable to sign with an NHL team in the 2009 off-season, Pettinger returned to the Manitoba Moose, signing a professional try-out contract on October 14, 2009. Before long, however, injuries to the Vancouver Canucks resulted in him re- signing with his former NHL club on November 2 to a one-year, two-way deal worth the league-minimum $500,000 at the NHL level. Seven games later, he was sent back to the Moose in expectation of forward Daniel Sedin's return from injury after clearing waivers on November 21. On April 6, 2010 Pettinger was recalled by the Vancouver Canucks. After 422 NHL regular seasons games, Pettinger finally made his post-season debut in playing a solitary game with the Canucks in a 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Kings in the Western Conference Quarterfinals on April 15, 2010. On August 6, 2010, Pettinger left North America and signed a one-year contract with German team K√∂lner Haie of the DEL. After completing a second season with the Sharks, Pettinger opted to remain in the DEL for a third season, however opted to sign with fellow club, the Hamburg Freezers, on a one-year deal on April 9, 2012.

Capital appreciation may occur passively and gradually, without the investor taking any action. It is distinguished from a capital gain which is the profit achieved by selling an asset. Capital appreciation may or may not be shown in financial statements; if it is shown, by revaluation of the asset, the increase is said to be \\"recognized\\". Once the asset is sold, the appreciation since the date of initially buying the asset becomes a \\"realized\\" gain. When the term is used in reference to stock valuation, capital appreciation is the goal of an investor seeking long term growth. It is growth in the principal amount invested, but not necessarily an increase in the current income from the asset.

The virus was isolated by a UCLA engineering student who discovered it in a copy of the \\"speed.com\\" program distributed with a new motherboard. Viral infection was first indicated when an early version of Microsoft Word reported internal checksum failure and failed to run. Infection Westwood was an early variant of the Jerusalem virus, which was the first DOS file infector to become common. Upon execution of an infected file, Westwood becomes memory resident. Any file of COM, EXE, or OVL types is infected upon execution, except COMMAND.COM. Symptoms A number of symptoms are associated with Westwood: *COM files executed will increase by 1,829 bytes in size; EXE and OVL files will increase by between 1,819 and 1,829 bytes. *Interrupts 8 and 21 will be hooked; on Friday the 13th, interrupt 22 will also be hooked. *Thirty minutes after the virus goes memory resident, the system will slow down, and a small black box will appear in the bottom left-hand corner of the machine, as common among most Jerusalem variants. These symptoms are not indicative of a Westwood infection, although the final symptom is certainly not regular program behaviour, and any automatic file size increase of executables is suspicious. The infection mechanism in Westwood is better-written than the original Jerusalem's. The original would re-infect files until they grew to ridiculous sizes. Westwood infects only once. As with most Jerusalem variants, Westwood contains a destructive payload. On every Friday the 13th, interrupt 22 will be hooked. All programs executed on this date while the virus is memory resident will be deleted. Westwood is functionally similar to Jerusalem, but the coding is quite different in many areas. Because of this, virus removal signatures used to detect the original Jerusalem had to be modified to detect Westwood. Organisations such as Virus Bulletin used to use Westwood to test virus scanners for ability to distinguish Jerusalem variants. Prevalence The WildList , an organization tracking computer viruses, never reported Westwood as being in the field. However, its isolation was made after the virus had made infections in the community of Westwood. It is unknown how much Westwood spread outside California (with a few reports in neighbouring states), especially as Westwood is easily mis-diagnosed as Jerusalem. Since the advent of Windows, even successful Jerusalem variants have become increasingly uncommon. As such, Westwood is considered obsolete.

Life  Born in Pest (now Budapest) on 2 May 1845 into an ethnic German family in Hungary.William D. Godsey, Aristocratic Redoubt: The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office on the Eve of the First World War, West Lafayette, Purdue University Press, 1999, p. 155. His father Michael Hengelm√ºller was an Austrian court official. On 3 April 1893, he married Marie n√©e Countess Dunin-Borkowska (1859‚Äì?), a widow and daughter of Count Alfred Dunin-Borkowski (1834‚Äì1895), in Dresden.Dunin-Borkowski After having served in the Chancellery of the Royal Hungarian Court and the Ministry of Finance, Hengelm√ºller began his diplomatic career. In 1868, he was appointed as Chancellor of the General consulate for China and Japan, and then served briefly in the Foreign Ministry in Vienna. Following a stint at the Consulate in Budapest, he was stationed in Washington D.C. and Berlin from 1870 to 1874. In 1875, he was responsible for the preparations of a commercial treaty with Germany and was thereafter dispatched to Paris in 1876 and to London in 1879.'Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r Ladislaus Baron', √ñsterreichisches Biographisches Lexikon 1815-1950, vol. 2, Vienna, Verlag der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1957, p. 272. It was in this latter posting, where he remained for almost a decade, where he distinguished himself and acquired a reputation for shrewdness. One of his achievements during this time was to obtain a public apology by Britain's Prime Minister William Gladstone, who was well known for his stubbornness.'Von Hengemuller, ex-diplomat, dead', New York Times, 27 April 1917. In 1887, Hengelm√ºller was appointed to serve as minister at Belgrade in the wake of the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885-1886 and had to exercise a restraining influence on Serbian King Milan I, whose throne depended on Austro-Hungarian support.'The new dean of the diplomatic corps at Washington', New York Times, 26 June 1910. In 1889, he was ennobled as Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r and appointed a Privy Counsellor (Geheimrat). In 1891, he became minister at Rio de Janeiro before being appointed to serve as minister at Washington D.C. in 1894. Described as clever and experienced, Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r became greatly popular and well-respected during his long period of service in Washington D.C.'The new dean of the diplomatic corps at Washington', op. cit.. In late 1902, he was informed that his legation would be upgraded to an embassy and that he would be promoted to the rank of ambassador.'Austria's envoy promoted', New York Times, 9 December 1902.

Countess Marie Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r, n√©e Dunin-Borkowska Baron Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r was present on 10 January 1908 at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City when the American Priory of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusalem was officially incorporated.Knights of Malta In 1909, he signed an arbitration treaty between the United States and the Austro- Hungarian Empire, which provided for a Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.Arbitration Convention between the United States and Austria-Hungary On 23 February 1910, he became dean of the diplomatic corps in Washington D.C.Diplomatic Representation for Republic of Austria When former President Roosevelt, with whom he had become a good friend, visited Austria-Hungary in 1910, he was one of the hostsSee for example 'Big Vienna programme', New York Times, 14 April 1910; Roosevelt's day in Vienna', op. cit., 16 April 1910; 'Roosevelt royally welcomed in Vienna', op. cit., 16 April 1910; 'Dinner with the Emperor', op. cit., 17 April 1910; 'A busy day in Budapest', op. cit., 19 April 1910. and Roosevelt also wrote the preface of the Baron's book on Prince R√°k√≥czi, a Hungarian leader of an uprising against the Habsburgs in the eighteenth century, in 1913. It could be noted though that the Baron's own Hungarian skills were considered rather weak although he was considered an eminent linguist in diplomatic circles.Godsey, op. cit., p. 144. On a more anecdotal level, Baron Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r was subject to a quote by the then President Taft: \\"Let him wait\\", Taft told Captain Butt regarding the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador's impatience over a delayed appointment. \\"A man with the name of Hengelmuller should not want me to leave my lunch\\".William Howard Taft humour In the autumn of 1912, he formally announced his retirement and that he would return to Vienna after close to twenty years in Washington D.C.'Austrian envoy quitting', New York Times, 24 August 1912. His long years of service, along with the fact that his friend Count Lexa von Aehrenthal had died earlier that year, likely contributed to this end.'Hengelmueller may resign', New York Times, 21 December 1910. He was succeeded as US Ambassador by Konstantin Dumba, who held the post until 1915 when he was declared persona non grata and expelled from the country by President Wilson. Baron Hengelm√ºller von Hengelv√°r, who had been appointed a lifetime member of the Hungarian House of Magnates in 1910, died on 22 April 1917 at Abbazia (now Opatija), one of the leading health resorts of the Habsburg Empire located in Istria.

It is based on most of a partially articulated skeleton and partial skull, showing it to have been a small, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaur. It is one of the few described non- hadrosaurid ornithopods from the end of the Cretaceous in North America, existing around 70 million years ago. Description Size of Parksosaurus (center) compared to its relatives Thescelosaurus (right) and Orodromeus (left), as well as a human Explicit estimates of the entire size of the animal are rare; in 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated the length at 2.5 meters, the weight at forty-five kilograms.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 277 William Parks found the hindlimb of his T. warreni to be about the same length overall as that of Thescelosaurus neglectus (93.0 centimeters (3.05 ft) for T. warreni versus 95.5 centimeters (3.13 ft) for T. neglectus), even though the shin was shorter than the thigh in T. neglectus, the opposite of T. warreni. Thus, the animal would have been comparable to the better-known Thescelosaurus in linear dimensions, despite proportional differences (around 1 meter (3.3 ft) tall at the hips, 2-2.5 meters (6.56-8.2 ft) long). The proportional differences probably would have made it lighter, though, as less weight was concentrated near the thigh. Like Thescelosaurus, it had thin partly ossified cartilaginous (intercostal) plates along the ribs. The shoulder girdle was robust. Parksosaurus had at least eighteen teeth in the maxilla and about twenty in the lower jaw; the number of teeth in the premaxilla is unknown. Classification Parksosaurus has been considered to be a hypsilophodont since its description. Recent reviews have dealt with it with little comment, although David B. Norman and colleagues (2004), in the framework of a paraphyletic Hypsilophodontidae, found it to be the sister taxon to Thescelosaurus, and Richard Butler and colleagues (2008) found that it may be close to the South American genus Gasparinisaura. However, basal ornithopod phylogeny is poorly known at this point, albeit under study. Like Thescelosaurus, Parksosaurus had a relatively robust hindlimb, and an elongate skull without as much of an arched shape to the forehead compared to other hypsilophodonts. A 2015 study placed it as an intermediate member of Iguanodontia more derived than Elasmaria. Cladogram based in the phylogenetic analysis of Rozadilla et al., 2015: Discovery and history Fossil, Royal Ontario Museum Paleontologist William Parks described skeleton ROM 804 in 1926 as Thescelosaurus warreni, which had in 1922 been discovered in what was then called the Edmonton Formation near Rumsey Ferry on the Red Deer River. When found, it consisted of a partial skull missing the beak region, most of the left pectoral girdle (including a suprascapula, a bone more commonly found in lizards, but which is believed to have been present in cartilaginous form in some ornithopods due to the roughened ends of their scapulae), the left arm except the hand, ribs and sternal elements, a damaged left pelvis, right ischium, the left leg except for some toe bones, articulated vertebrae from the back, hip, and tail, and a number of ossified tendons that sheathed the end of the tail. The body of the animal had fallen on its left side, and most of the right side had been destroyed before burial; in addition, the head had been separated from the body, and the neck lost. Parks differentiated the new species from T. neglectus by leg proportions; T. warreni had a longer tibia than femur, and longer toes. Charles M. Sternberg, upon the discovery of the specimen he named Thescelosaurus edmontonensis, revisited T. warreni and found that it warranted its own genus (it was named in an abstract, which is not typical, but the specimen had already been thoroughly described). In 1940, he presented a more thorough comparison and found a number of differences between the two genera throughout the body. He assigned Parksosaurus to the Hypsilophodontinae with Hypsilophodon and Dysalotosaurus, and Thescelosaurus to the Thescelosaurinae. The genus attracted little attention until Peter Galton began his revision of hypsilophodonts in the 1970s. Parksosaurus received a redescription in 1973, wherein it was considered to be related to a Hypsilophodon\\\\Laosaurus\\\\L. minimus lineage. After this, it once again returned to obscurity. George Olshevsky emended the species name to P. warrenae in 1992, because the species name honors a woman (Mrs. H. D. Warren who financially supported the research), but outside of Internet sites, the original spelling has been preferred. Paleoecology and paleobiology Life restoration of Parksosaurus warreni Parksosaurus is known from the base of Unit 4 of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which dates to about 69.5 million years ago. Other dinosaur species from this same unit include the theropods Albertosaurus sarcophagus and Albertavenator curriei as well as the spike- crested hadrosaurid Saurolophus osborni, hollow-crested hadrosaurid Hypacrosaurus altispinus, and ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus lambei. Teeth of an unidentified ceratopsian species are known from the same stratigraphic level. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. In life, Parksosaurus, as a hypsilophodont, would have been a small, swift bipedal herbivore. It would have had a moderately long neck and small head with a horny beak, short but strong forelimbs, and long powerful hindlimbs. Paul in 2010 suggested that the long toes were an adaptation for walking over mud or clay near rivers and that the strong arms were used for burrowing.

The university was established in 2012 by the Rai Foundation through the Gujarat Private Universities Act (Amendment), 2012, the same act which established Indus University. History Rai University was originally established by the Rai Foundation in 2002 in Chhattisgarh, one of 46 universities which were established through The Chhattisgarh Niji Kshetra Vishwavidyalaya (Sthapana aur Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 2001 within a year. The act empowered the state to establish a university through a gazette notification and further allowed such universities to affiliate colleges and set up campuses. At its peak, the university had eleven campuses around Chhattisgarh and a total of 29 colleges across 25 campuses in India and abroad. It offered more than 300 courses. In 2005 the Supreme Court of India passed a decision which cancelled the relevant sections in the above-mentioned act, thus closing 117 universities, Rai University among them. The various campuses under Rai Foundation sought affiliation with other university such as Pandit Ravishankar Shukla University for the Raipur campus the Delhi University for the New Delhi campus and the Maharishi Dayanand University for the Gurgaon campus. One of the campuses was the Belapur campus at Ahmedabad, Gujarat, which was established in 2004. In 2012 the Government of Gujarat invited the Rai Foundation to establish a private university in the Belapur campus. The university was established in 2012 through the Gujarat Private Universities Act (Amendment), 2012, the same act which established Indus University. Academics The university offers both undergraduate (B.Sc., B.A., BBA and LLB) courses and postgraduate (M.Sc., M.Tech., MBA) ones, as well as engineering diploma courses. Admission is based on national and state entrance exams and a personal interview. Ph.D. positions are also available. The university is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) which has also published an inspection report in 2015, and a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU). Schools The institute runs nine schools: * School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) * Rai Business School (RBS) * College of Media & Communication (CMAC) * Institute of Design Engineering and Architecture (IDEA) * College of Hospitality and Tourism (CHAT) * School of Fashion Technology & Performing Arts (SOFT) * School of Arts, Science & Commerce (SASC) * School of Law (SOL) * School of Agriculture (SOA) * School of Life Sciences (SOLS) * Center for Research & Development (CRD) Controversy In 2016 the Government of Gujarat directed Rai University (along with Parul University) to stop admission to its agriculture courses which were unrecognized by the government. This has led to student protests. The university has issued a public notice clarifying that as a university approved by state Act, the above-mentioned recognition is not required.

Woodbury (1899 near Spencer, in the Hawkesbury Valley of New South Wales - 1979) was an Australian Catholic philosopher. Biography Austin Maloney Woodbury S.M. (1899-1979) was born on 2 March 1899 at Lower Mangrove (Spencer), New South Wales, Australia. He was the sixth child of Austin Herbert Woodbury and his wife Margaret, nee Maloney, who had eleven children. His family was devoutly Catholic. Four of his sisters joined religious orders. From an early age Woodbury showed great intellectual promise and a love of learning. He discerned a vocation to the religious life and entered the Society of Mary (Marist Fathers) in 1918, completing his secondary studies at the juniorate in Sydney and Mittagong (1919‚Äì20). On 7 March 1921, the feast of St Thomas Aquinas, he entered the New Zealand Marist Novitiate at ‚ÄúGreenmeadows‚Äù Seminary in Hawkes Bay, Napier and took his first vows on 2 February 1923. Woodbury was sent to Rome in 1926 for further studies at the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas in the City (Angelicum). There he was taught by the prominent Dominican theologian Fr Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange O.P (1874-1964). He completed two doctorates in a very short space of time between 1927-1928. During his time in Rome he was ordained to the priesthood on 31 July 1927. On his return from Rome in 1928 he was sent to New Zealand where he taught at St Patrick‚Äôs College, Wellington and then at Greenmeadows (1930‚Äì36). From 1938 to 1943 he became founding rector of Bl. Peter Chanel Seminary, Toongabbie, NSW. On 7 March 1945 Dr Woodbury established the Aquinas Academy in Sydney. The Academy was a school of philosophy and theology open to the laity, which, as the name suggests, sought to especially promote the teachings of St Thomas Aquinas. During the period 1945 to 1974 Dr Woodbury taught courses in both philosophy and theology, and at the height of his teaching an average of 600 students would enrol each year. He retired from the Academy in 1974 and died in Sydney on 3 February 1979. The Aquinas Academy: The Aquinas Academy was set up under the auspices of the Australian Province of the Marist Fathers by Fr Austin Woodbury SM in March 1945. The Academy began as a centre for the study of Philosophy and Theology in the Thomistic tradition. For some twenty-nine years it continued in this capacity under Fr Woodbury's guidance, in premises at the back of St Patrick's Church, Gloucester Street, in The Rocks (Sydney, NSW). For a short while the Academy offered a License in Philosophy under accreditation from the University of St Thomas in Rome. Since its inception, a number of qualified priests, religious and laity have been part of the lecturing staff. The Academy was one of the pioneers of Catholic adult education in Australia. Since 1975, the Academy has increasingly focused on general adult education in the faith. It no longer teaches Thomistic philosophy or theology. References *J.

Scientists continue to explore how some cognitive functions tend to be dominated by one side or the other; that is, how they are lateralized. The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The medial longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere. Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history. The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have a neuronal basis in both hemispheres. Another example is that each hemisphere in the brain tends to represent one side of the body. In the cerebellum, this is the same body side, but in the forebrain this is predominantly the contralateral side.  Lateralized functions =Language= Language functions such as grammar, vocabulary and literal meaning are typically lateralized to the left hemisphere, especially in right-handed individuals. p. 367 While language production is left- lateralized in up to 90% of right-handers, it is more bilateral, or even right-lateralized, in approximately 50% of left-handers. Chapter 7 Broca's area and Wernicke's area, associated with the production of speech and comprehension of speech, respectively, are located in the left cerebral hemisphere for about 95% of right-handers but about 70% of left-handers. Individuals who speak multiple languages demonstrate separate speech areas for each language. =Sensory processing= The processing of basic sensory information is lateralized by being divided into left and right sides of the body or the space around the body. In vision, about half the neurons of the optic nerve from each eye cross to project to the opposite hemisphere, and about half do not cross to project to the hemisphere on the same side.https://theodora.com/anatomy/the_optic_nerve.html This means that the left side of the visual field is processed largely by the visual cortex of the right hemisphere and vice versa for the right side of the visual field. In hearing, about 90% of the neurons of the auditory nerve from one ear cross to project to the auditory cortex of the opposite hemisphere. In the sense of touch, most of the neurons from the skin cross to project to the somatosensory cortex of the opposite hemisphere. Because of this functional division of the left and right sides of the body and of the space that surrounds it, the processing of information in the sensory cortices is essentially identical. That is, the processing of visual and auditory stimuli, spatial manipulation, facial perception, and artistic ability are represented bilaterally. Numerical estimation, comparison and online calculation depend on bilateral parietal regions while exact calculation and fact retrieval are associated with left parietal regions, perhaps due to their ties to linguistic processing. =Value systems= Rather than just being a series of places where different brain modules occur, there are running similarities in the kind of function seen in each side, for instance how right-side impairment of drawing ability making patients draw the parts of the subject matter with wholly incoherent relationships, or where the kind of left-side damage seen in language impairment not damaging the patient's ability to catch the significance of intonation in speech.McGilchrist (2009) provides an extensive survey of the relevant literature in chapter two. This has led British psychiatrist Iain McGilchrist to say that the two hemispheres as having different value systems, where the left hemisphere tends to reduce complex matters such as ethics to rules and measures, where the right hemisphere is disposed to the holistic and metaphorical. Clinical significance Depression is linked with a hyperactive right hemisphere, with evidence of selective involvement in \\"processing negative emotions, pessimistic thoughts and unconstructive thinking styles\\", as well as vigilance, arousal and self-reflection, and a relatively hypoactive left hemisphere, \\"specifically involved in processing pleasurable experiences\\" and \\"relatively more involved in decision-making processes\\". Additionally, \\"left hemisphere lesions result in an omissive response bias or error pattern whereas right hemisphere lesions result in a commissive response bias or error pattern.\\" The delusional misidentification syndromes, reduplicative paramnesia and Capgras delusion are also often the result of right hemisphere lesions. = Hemisphere damage = Damage to either the right or left hemisphere, and its resulting deficits provide insight into the function of the damaged area. Left hemisphere damage has many effects on language production and perception. Damage or lesions to the right hemisphere can result in a lack of emotional prosody or intonation when speaking. Right hemisphere damage also has grave effects on understanding discourse. People with damage to the right hemisphere have a reduced ability to generate inferences, comprehend and produce main concepts, and a reduced ability to manage alternative meanings. Furthermore, people with right hemisphere damage often exhibit discourse that is abrupt and perfunctory or verbose and excessive. They can also have pragmatic deficits in situations of turn taking, topic maintenance and shared knowledge. Lateral brain damage can also affect visual perceptual spatial resolution. People with left hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of high resolution, or detailed, aspects of an image. People with right hemisphere damage may have impaired perception of low resolution, or big picture, aspects of an image. = Plasticity = If a specific region of the brain, or even an entire hemisphere, is injured or destroyed, its functions can sometimes be assumed by a neighboring region in the same hemisphere or the corresponding region in the other hemisphere, depending upon the area damaged and the patient's age. When injury interferes with pathways from one area to another, alternative (indirect) connections may develop to communicate information with detached areas, despite the inefficiencies. = Broca's aphasia = Broca's aphasia is a specific type of expressive aphasia and is so named due to the aphasia that results from damage or lesions to the Broca's area of the brain, that exists most commonly in the left inferior frontal hemisphere. Thus, the aphasia that develops from the lack of functioning of the Broca's area is an expressive and non-fluent aphasia. It is called 'non-fluent' due to the issues that arise because Broca's area is critical for language pronunciation and production. The area controls some motor aspects of speech production and articulation of thoughts to words and as such lesions to the area result in specific non-fluent aphasia.Biopsychology (8th edition), by John J.P. Pinel Pearson 2011 = Wernicke's aphasia = Wernicke's aphasia is the result of damage to the area of the brain that is commonly in the left hemisphere above the Sylvian fissure. Damage to this area causes primarily a deficit in language comprehension. While the ability to speak fluently with normal melodic intonation is spared, the language produced by a person with Wernicke's aphasia is riddled with semantic errors and may sound nonsensical to the listener. Wernicke's aphasia is characterized by phonemic paraphasias, neologism or jargon. Another characteristic of a person with Wernicke's aphasia is that they are unconcerned by the mistakes that they are making. Society and culture =Misapplication= Terence Hines states that the research on brain lateralization is valid as a research program, though commercial promoters have applied it to promote subjects and products far outside the implications of the research. For example, the implications of the research have no bearing on psychological interventions such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and neurolinguistic programming,, available in ALLEA Annual Report 2003 , pp. 61‚Äì72 brain-training equipment, or management training. = Pop psychology = The oversimplification of lateralization in pop psychology. This belief was widely held even in the scientific community for some years. Some popularizations oversimplify the science about lateralization, by presenting the functional differences between hemispheres as being more absolute than is actually the case. =Sex differences= In the 19th century and to a lesser extent the 20th, it was thought that each side of the brain was associated with a specific gender: the left corresponding with masculinity and the right with femininity and each half could function independently. The right side of the brain was seen as the inferior and thought to be prominent in women, savages, children, criminals, and the insane. A prime example of this in fictional literature can be seen in Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Evolutionary advantage The widespread lateralization of many vertebrate animals indicates an evolutionary advantage associated with the specialization of each hemisphere. History =Broca= One of the first indications of brain function lateralization resulted from the research of French physician Pierre Paul Broca, in 1861. His research involved the male patient nicknamed \\"Tan\\", who suffered a speech deficit (aphasia); \\"tan\\" was one of the few words he could articulate, hence his nickname. In Tan's autopsy, Broca determined he had a syphilitic lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere. This left frontal lobe brain area (Broca's area) is an important speech production region. The motor aspects of speech production deficits caused by damage to Broca's area are known as expressive aphasia. In clinical assessment of this aphasia, it is noted that the patient cannot clearly articulate the language being employed. =Wernicke= German physician Karl Wernicke continued in the vein of Broca's research by studying language deficits unlike expressive aphasia. Wernicke noted that not every deficit was in speech production; some were linguistic. He found that damage to the left posterior, superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) caused language comprehension deficits rather than speech production deficits, a syndrome known as receptive aphasia. =Imaging= These seminal works on hemispheric specialization were done on patients or postmortem brains, raising questions about the potential impact of pathology on the research findings. New methods permit the in vivo comparison of the hemispheres in healthy subjects. Particularly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) are important because of their high spatial resolution and ability to image subcortical brain structures. =Movement and sensation= In the 1940s, neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield and his neurologist colleague Herbert Jasper developed a technique of brain mapping to help reduce side effects caused by surgery to treat epilepsy. They stimulated motor and somatosensory cortices of the brain with small electrical currents to activate discrete brain regions. They found that stimulation of one hemisphere's motor cortex produces muscle contraction on the opposite side of the body. Furthermore, the functional map of the motor and sensory cortices is fairly consistent from person to person; Penfield and Jasper's famous pictures of the motor and sensory homunculi were the result. =Split-brain patients= Research by Michael Gazzaniga and Roger Wolcott Sperry in the 1960s on split-brain patients led to an even greater understanding of functional laterality. Split-brain patients are patients who have undergone corpus callosotomy (usually as a treatment for severe epilepsy), a severing of a large part of the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres of the brain and allows them to communicate. When these connections are cut, the two halves of the brain have a reduced capacity to communicate with each other. This led to many interesting behavioral phenomena that allowed Gazzaniga and Sperry to study the contributions of each hemisphere to various cognitive and perceptual processes. One of their main findings was that the right hemisphere was capable of rudimentary language processing, but often has no lexical or grammatical abilities.Kandel E, Schwartz J, Jessel T. Principles of Neural Science. 4th ed. p1182. New York: McGraw-Hill; 2000. Eran Zaidel also studied such patients and found some evidence for the right hemisphere having at least some syntactic ability. Language is primarily localized in the left hemisphere. One of the experiments carried out by Gazzaniga involved a split-brain male patient sitting in front of a computer screen while having words and images presented on either side of the screen, and the visual stimuli would go to either the right or left visual field, and thus the left or right brain, respectively. It was observed that if the patient was presented with an image to his left visual field (right brain), he would report not seeing anything. If he was able to feel around for certain objects, he could accurately pick out the correct object, despite not having the ability to verbalize what he saw. This led to confirmation that the left brain is localized for language whereas the right brain does not have this capability, and when the corpus callosum is cut, the two hemispheres cannot communicate in order for situation-pertinent speech to be produced.

It runs on Namco Pac-Land hardware but with a video system like that used in Dragon Buster. It is also the first game from Namco to allow two players to play simultaneously. The game was later released on the Famicom (brought to the American NES by Sunsoft), and both this version for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and the original arcade version for the Wii were later released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service. The NES version was also ported to arcades for the Nintendo VS. System as VS. Super Sky Kid, but promotional materials and the cabinet for this version just use the name VS. Sky Kid. A sequel named Sky Kid Deluxe was released in 1986. It introduced several new enemies and missions, and was the first game to run on Namco's then-new Namco System 86 hardware. Gameplay Sky Kid is a two-dimensional scrolling shooter game. The players take control of the Sky Kids, \\"Red Baron\\" and \\"Blue Max\\", which are references to Manfred von Richthofen, the famous World War I flying ace, and the prestigious order Pour le M√©rite informally known as Blue Max. The Sky Kids fly around in biplanes and are assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involve bombing specific targets. The \\"A\\" button is used to control the plane's machine gun and the \\"B\\" button is used to perform a loop. A number of obstacles face the players in each level. First, their biplane is not equipped with a bomb to complete their mission and must be picked up en route to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep the Sky Kids from accomplishing their mission. Last, the Sky Kids may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets which the Sky Kids must bomb will either be fortress complexes, or ships. As the players advance further up in the 21 missions, multiple targets will begin to appear in the course of one mission. Players receive points for destroying air and ground targets, and receive additional points at the end of the mission for how many of these types of targets are destroyed. In addition, players get points based on how much of the target is destroyed - but only total destruction warrants an end-of-mission bonus. Occasionally, performing a loop over a billboard will reveal one of four hidden Namco characters: Pac- Man, Inky, the Special Flag from Rally-X (which, like the Galaxian flagship, has appeared in several other Namco games) or Pooka from Dig Dug. If the player performs a loop in front of the three dancing girls which appear at the end of each mission, the girls will send out hearts representing kisses. If the player should shoot the girls, or hearts, they will turn into pink powder puffs and waving dogs respectively. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Sky Kid on their January 15, 1986 issue as being the second most- successful table arcade unit of the year. Other appearances in media *Sky Kid was briefly resurrected as a webcomic strip, part of Bandai Namco's ShiftyLook line featuring artwork done by Udon Entertainment. The strip focuses on the exploits of the game's two protagonists, Red Baron and Blue Max. *Blue Max, known as \\"Sky Kid\\", also appears as a recurring character in the ShiftyLook animated series Mappy: The Beat. Sky Kid is a good-natured, but unhelpful and stupid employee of Nyamco who speaks with a Southern accent, and often unintentionally gets on Mappy and Dig Dug's nerves.

It was financed by, and in cooperation with, the Danish Film Institute, with the support of the \\"Development Fund of the Ministry of Culture\\", the MEDIA Programme of the European Union and the DFI Film Workshop. It is distributed by SF FILM A/S.  Introduction  Switching is a different type of film that paves the way for new storytelling methods. Switching was specially developed for DVD video. The fascination with interactive expression basically originates in its potential to depict a more fragmented form of reality. The user of this film enters a narrative labyrinth simultaneously unfolding and disrupting the story. There are three elements that explain why Switching departs from the linear form: #The film can be changed at any time. Consequently, the user can jump back and forth in time and location. #The interface and content are not divided; in other words, the screen has no buttons to click - the interface is transparent. The film itself is the clickable object. Accordingly, linear control and logic disappear. #The narrative is structured around a circular system in which everything repeats itself. So it has no ending. The film continues forever in its circular universe. Story Frida and Simon are in a relationship, but something has changed where they must make a decision. They find themselves wishing for change, yet that wish stands in the way of their wish to hold on to the past. The viewer is caught in this moment and through their choices they uniquely determine their own film experience.

Gameplay It was notable for attempting to cover a broad range of technological levels and having an intricate \\"engineering\\" style of vehicle design by the player using formulas and tables. The game also had an innovative command system that forced the player to lead a force and execute a plan with limited time/command pressure and constant communication/morale to maintain. The combat rules were an elaboration on the rules introduced in the Azhanti High Lightning game, using a 2D6 mechanic very different from the original \\"Traveller\\" rules. A later game, Striker II, was based on the systems in GDW's Command Decision World War II rules and tied to the role-playing game Traveller: The New Era. The game used 15mm scale figures that were produced by the now defunct Martian Miniatures.* All of the major Traveller races were represented, including Zhodani, Aslan, and Imperial humans. The game enjoyed popularity in the early 1980s but was quickly eclipsed by new products by rival companies like Fasa's Battletech and Games Workshop's Warhammer 40k. One reason for its decline may have been the rules mechanics which attempted to combine the decision making of a roleplaying game with the tactical maneuverings of a miniatures war-game. The result of this fusion was seen as a \\"worst of both worlds\\" situation which left players looking for a more streamlined game. *The range of figures made by RAFM for Striker are still available, just not in their Striker unit compositions. Reception In the July 1982 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 53), William A. Barton gave a thumbs up, saying, \\"Striker is probably the most thorough, well-conceived and worthwhile set of miniatures rules yet published for SF or any post-19th century conflict. I heartily recommend it to Traveller players and miniature enthusiasts and look forward to future expansions.\\" Andy Slack reviewed Striker for White Dwarf #33, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that \\"it covers and integrates all the elements of the Traveller combat environment for the first time, and allows vehicle design ‚Äì although the game is enjoyable in its own right, and perfectly playable as a stand-alone set of miniatures rules; however, referees and players do have limited time available, and I for one prefer to spend it playing rather than designing tanks. The clean simplicity of Traveller is getting lost in a maze of calculations. Still, Striker, is believable and fun.\\" In the Fall 1983 edition of Ares (Issue 15), Thomas J. Thomas liked the well-organized \\"clear and concise\\" rules, and especially admired the fact that they were cross- referenced. Thomas also thought the command and initiative rules \\"demonstrate the limits on both a commander's time and the varying abilities of troops to respond to changing situations.\\" However, he thought the need for written orders might be a problem for some players, and he criticized the use of the phrase \\"all statements must be clear and unambiguous\\", arguing that the statement itself was ambiguous. Thomas also thought the process for designing vehicles and aircraft was \\"incredibly time-consuming.\\" He concluded with a strong recommendation for beginning miniatures players, stating, \\"Striker presents a significant advance for miniatures games... Though not without its flaws, Striker, nevertheless, is probably the most interesting and coherent modern miniatures game available.\\" Awards Striker won two Origins Awards: * \\"Best Miniatures Rules of 1982\\" * \\"All Time Best Miniatures Rules for Science Fiction Battles of 1982 \\" References Category:Frank Chadwick games Category:Origins Award winners Category:Traveller (role-playing game) board games ","title":"Striker (miniatures game)"},{"id":"3665962","text":"WCBA (1350 AM) is a radio station in the Elmira-Corning market of New York state. It broadcasts at 1000 watts day and 37 watts night on 1350 kHz from studios in South Corning, NY.  History  The station signed on as Corning's second AM station prior to 1967, according to the obituary for John T. Horn, the longtime disc jockey known on the air as Jack Shane. Dean Slack bought the station in 1977 and persuaded Horn, who started his career at WCBA 10 years earlier and was then a top personality at WENY, to return. \\"Dean and Jack\\" hosted the morning show on the adult contemporary station for 12 years. In 1988, Slack signed WCBA-FM on the air, giving WCBA an FM presence in the market. The stations were simulcast early on and often were referred to in marketing as \\"The WCBA stations\\". Slack sold the stations in 1990 to Eolin Broadcasting Inc., which was headed by former Gateway Communications television station manager Bob Eolin, his wife Dee, and Horn. Bob Eolin replaced Slack as morning-show co-host. By the early 1990s, WCBA had established an Adult standards format, while the FM remained adult contemporary. The adult contemporary morning show aired on both stations. WCBA \\"1350 Gold\\" logo In 1997, WCBA acquired its longtime rival and Horn's former employer (after his first WCBA tenure) WCLI when Eolin Broadcasting bought the station from Sabre Communications. A year prior to that, Eolin Broadcasting had bought WGMM. In 2001, Eolin Broadcasting bought WENY and WENY-FM from White Broadcasting. At that point, Horn had become a part owner of all of the stations for which he worked in the market. He died unexpectedly in July 2002 at his summer home on Seneca Lake. \\"Bob and Dee\\" hosted the morning show until they sold their stations a little more than a year later to Route 81 Radio, based in Hazleton, PA. Following the collapse of Route 81 Radio, the station was sold to WS Media, LLC, a company controlled by William Christian of Vision Communications. After WHHO ceased operations in 2009, the station dropped its standards format in favor of the Fox Sports Radio Network. WS Media is in the process of swapping WCBA in exchange for WKPQ; WCBA will be transferred to Phoenix Radio, Inc. in the transfer. Effective March 15, 2013, Great Radio, LLC (another company controlled by Christian) acquired WCBA for $6,000. Christian took the station silent on June 21, 2019.https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/silent-am-list The station returned to the air December 20.

The original toy series was produced by Kenner in the early 1990s. An animated television series was made in 1995 by Sunbow Productions and Jean Chalopin Creativite et Developpement, based on the franchise. The franchise was relaunched in 2005 and there are currently over 3,000 different pet toys that have been created since. Hasbro, alongside various digital media developers, have produced video games for consoles such as the Nintendo DS, Wii and PlayStation 3. A second animated television series was produced by Hasbro Studios for Discovery Family, a U.S. cable network partially owned by Hasbro. This series premiered in 2012 and concluded in 2016 after 104 episodes. Hasbro has created virtual pets to 'adopt' and play with online. These websites were Littlest Pet Shop VIP, and Littlest Pet Shop Online. In 2010, Hasbro released their version of Blythe as a part of this toy line. Hasbro has created many different versions of these creatures. The first series was created in 2005, the second release in 2008, the third release in 2012, and the most recent release in 2014. There have been various Littlest Pet Shop toy figures.

It contained a cat house (with a built-in litter box on the base), a food dish, a scratching post, and a magnetized toy mouse on a string. The golden kitten's head had a magnet in it and would bobble its head when the mouse was dangled in front of it. Pressing the gray-white kitten's tail would cause the arms to move up and down in a scratching motion. * Mice ‚Äì Three mice (two of which were magnetized, grey or white in the 1992 version, black-and-white with patches in the 1993 version). A terrarium with a landscape insert, a lid that could be flipped over to become a maze, magnetized cheese, a water bottle and a food dish. * Turtles ‚Äì Two turtles with a terrarium (green with blue shells in 92, yellow with purple and pink shells in 93), a water dispenser, a landscape with a palm tree, and a food dish. One turtle pulls head when moved and the other turtle walks when pushed along a flat surface. * Playful Puppies ‚Äì Two dogs (a white fluffy dog, a brown and white mutt; a grey-white splotched fluffy dog and a pure brown mutt in the 1993 version). It contained a large basket, a newspaper, a dog bone, a fire hydrant, and a food dish. Fluffy dog wags tail when head is pushed forward and mutt has a magnet, so it chases bone. Cozy Home Pets * Puppy Trio ‚Äì A Poodle, a collie, and a black- and-white spaniel. It came with a doghouse with a fenced-in green grass base, a food dish, with mailbox, and a magnetized newspaper. Pressing the poodle's tail would make her scratch her ear, pressing the collie's tail would make him shake his paw and the spaniel's bobble-head was magnetized to play tug of war with the paper and bone (1993 version had beige poodle, tricolor collie and brown and white spaniel). * Gerbils ‚Äì Four gerbils, containing two yellow transparent plastic enclosures, connecting pipes, an exercise wheel, a food dish, a water dispenser, and a magnetic wand to move the gerbils through pipes (1993 version had clear plastic enclosures). * Fish ‚Äì A tank with colorful floating fish and seahorse, with temperature, aqua coral, brown treasure chest with opening lid and yellow treasure inside and shell hand-pump attached to aquarium with transparent tube.

Kenner Parker Toys was acquired by Tonka in 1987. Under Tonka management, Kenner Products was reconstituted as a division. Tonka (including Kenner) was purchased by Hasbro in mid-1991. Hasbro closed the Cincinnati offices of Kenner in 2000, and Kenner's product lines were merged into Hasbro's. Stuffed versions of Littlest Pet Shop toys =Generation 1= The Littlest Pet Shop toy line had molds that looked more unrealistic compared to the 1990s incarnation of the franchise, and had realistic colors that blended in. They had bobble-heads and they came with a round pink or blue magnet with a pawprint on it, this is located on the bottom of their feet (2004‚Äì2005 versions). Some pets were fuzzy. Later ones had a smaller blue magnet with no pawprint which didn't have a specified location on the bottom. This series of sets were released as single packages, in pairs, in packs of twenty, and with playsets. =Generation 2= The eyes changed to a glossy polish rather than with a matte polish as it was in G1. These pets have symbols in their eyes, such as a snowflake (chilliest), a diamond (fanciest), a cookie with a bite (hungriest), a raindrop (sportiest), a flower (cuddliest), and a wind symbol on some Comic Con-exclusive pets, although there were also glossy-eyed pets with no eye symbols. They are the most collected pets as well. They also came in brighter colors. From 2007 onwards, the pets didn't have a magnet, but a circle with a shape of a hexagon inside the hole (except for birds with a rectangular slot for them to perch on playsets). A C-031 marking also showed up (except for birds). The most recent releases did not have the eye symbols, and had a redesign of the LPS logo. Some of the newest G2.5 pets go up to number 2600 in the range of Littlest Pet Shop numbers. =Generation 3= The line was revamped to coincide with the release of the 2012 TV series. It is the most hated generation, as most collectors and fans have described the generation as 'creepy looking' and 'demonic'. These pets did not last for a long time. Later on, they added the Sweetest Pets series (pets themed after sweets), Rolleroos (pet friends that are shaped like small balls), pets that came with Blythe, and the Fairies series. The pets now had different molds and a new eye style. Later on, Hasbro reissued the Totally Talented set from G1, and Blythe was also given a makeover. Hasbro received many complaints about the G3 line. =Generation 4= These pets have moulds that more closely resemble the style of the TV series and were given names. Hasbro released the Pets Pawsabilities collection during this time, and in 2016, the Pets in the City collection, which more closely resembles the pets released in G2. Due to popular demand and fan outcry over the G3 line, Hasbro brought the bobble-head pets back, which included pets from the 2012 TV show and used the same molds as the pets from the G1 and G2 lines. But it was also short-lived, as the bobble-head style was retired in mid-2014. =Generation 5= The Littlest Pet Shop toys were revamped in 2017, with new molds and rounded eyes similar to the second generation pets. Some of the toys released under this line include the Black and White Pop collection and the Rainbow collection. The pets in this line come in three sizes: teensie, mini, and classic (the largest of the three). It was also during this time that a new show premiered on Discovery Family called Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own. Media adaptations =Animation TV series and shorts= Littlest Pet Shop (1995) Littlest Pet Shop (2012) Littlest Pet Shop Presents The animated shorts, produced by Cosmic Toast Studios, were released online by Hasbro.

The series premiered on April 14, 2018 and ran for 52 eleven-minute episodes.

The station currently broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format branded as 98.3 FLY FM. The station broadcasts with 95,500 watts of power from its transmitter located in Harrowsmith. The station is owned by Bell Media. History The station was launched in 1953 as CKLC-FM, by St. Lawrence Broadcasting. AM sister station CKLC was launched at the same time. The station's original frequency was 99.5, and it was an affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Dominion Network until the network dissolved in 1962. CKLC-FM 99.5's original purpose back in 1953 was to provide a reliable audio link for CKLC-AM 1380, which broadcast from a four-tower array on Wolfe Island. Equalized Bell Telephone broadcast lines were not reliable out to Wolfe Island back in 1953, and the FM signal carried the program feed of CKLC- AM, which was received at the AM transmitter site over the air, and re- broadcast on the 1380 AM signal. Eventually, the Bell line problem was resolved, and the programming on CKLC-FM gradually became its own. CKLC-FM moved to 98.3 in 1973, and adopted its current callsign in 1978.

The topologies of both spaces have cardinality 2^{\\\\aleph_0}. These are examples of cardinal functions, a topic in set- theoretic topology. In mathematics, set-theoretic topology is a subject that combines set theory and general topology. It focuses on topological questions that are independent of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (ZFC). Objects studied in set-theoretic topology =Dowker spaces= In the mathematical field of general topology, a Dowker space is a topological space that is T4 but not countably paracompact. Dowker conjectured that there were no Dowker spaces, and the conjecture was not resolved until M.E. Rudin constructed oneM.E. Rudin, A normal space X for which X √ó I is not normal, Fundam.

Soc., 126(1998), 2459-2465. a subspace of Rudin's Dowker space of cardinality \\\\aleph_{\\\\omega+1} that is also Dowker. =Normal Moore spaces= A famous problem is the normal Moore space question, a question in general topology that was the subject of intense research. The answer to the normal Moore space question was eventually proved to be independent of ZFC. =Cardinal functions= Cardinal functions are widely used in topology as a tool for describing various topological properties. Below are some examples. (Note: some authors, arguing that \\"there are no finite cardinal numbers in general topology\\", prefer to define the cardinal functions listed below so that they never take on finite cardinal numbers as values; this requires modifying some of the definitions given below, e.g. by adding \\"\\\\;\\\\; + \\\\;\\\\aleph_0\\" to the right-hand side of the definitions, etc.) * Perhaps the simplest cardinal invariants of a topological space X are its cardinality and the cardinality of its topology, denoted respectively by X  and o(X). * The weight w(X ) of a topological space X is the smallest possible cardinality of a base for X. When w(X ) \\\\le \\\\aleph_0 the space X is said to be second countable. ** The \\\\pi-weight of a space X is the smallest cardinality of a \\\\pi-base for X. * The character of a topological space X at a point x is the smallest cardinality of a local base for x. The character of space X is \\\\chi(X)=\\\\sup \\\\; \\\\\\\\{\\\\chi(x,X) : x\\\\in X\\\\\\\\}. When \\\\chi(X) \\\\le \\\\aleph_0 the space X is said to be first countable. * The density d(X ) of a space X is the smallest cardinality of a dense subset of X. When \\\\rm{d}(X) \\\\le \\\\aleph_0 the space X is said to be separable. * The Lindel√∂f number L(X ) of a space X is the smallest infinite cardinality such that every open cover has a subcover of cardinality no more than L(X ). When \\\\rm{L}(X) = \\\\aleph_0 the space X is said to be a Lindel√∂f space. * The cellularity of a space X is {\\\\rm c}(X)=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{{\\\\mathcal U}:{\\\\mathcal U} is a family of mutually disjoint non- empty open subsets of X \\\\\\\\}. ** The Hereditary cellularity (sometimes spread) is the least upper bound of cellularities of its subsets: s(X)={\\\\rm hc}(X)=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{ {\\\\rm c} (Y) : Y\\\\subseteq X \\\\\\\\} or s(X)=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{Y:Y\\\\subseteq X with the subspace topology is discrete \\\\\\\\}. * The tightness t(x, X) of a topological space X at a point x\\\\in X is the smallest cardinal number \\\\alpha such that, whenever x\\\\in{\\\\rm cl}_X(Y) for some subset Y of X, there exists a subset Z of Y, with Z  ‚â§ \\\\alpha, such that x\\\\in{\\\\rm cl}_X(Z). Symbolically, t(x,X)=\\\\sup\\\\big\\\\\\\\{\\\\min\\\\\\\\{Z:Z\\\\subseteq Y\\\\ \\\\wedge\\\\ x\\\\in {\\\\rm cl}_X(Z)\\\\\\\\}:Y\\\\subseteq X\\\\ \\\\wedge\\\\ x\\\\in {\\\\rm cl}_X(Y)\\\\big\\\\\\\\}. The tightness of a space X is t(X)=\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{t(x,X):x\\\\in X\\\\\\\\}. When t(X) = \\\\aleph_0 the space X is said to be countably generated or countably tight. ** The augmented tightness of a space X, t^+(X) is the smallest regular cardinal \\\\alpha such that for any Y\\\\subseteq X, x\\\\in{\\\\rm cl}_X(Y) there is a subset Z of Y with cardinality less than \\\\alpha, such that x\\\\in{\\\\rm cl}_X(Z). =Martin's axiom= For any cardinal k, we define a statement, denoted by MA(k): > For any partial order P satisfying the countable chain condition (hereafter > ccc) and any family D of dense sets in P such that D ‚â§ k, there is a > filter F on P such that F ‚à© d is non-empty for every d in D. Since it is a theorem of ZFC that MA(c) fails, the Martin's axiom is stated as: > Martin's axiom (MA): For every k < c, MA(k) holds. In this case (for application of ccc), an antichain is a subset A of P such that any two distinct members of A are incompatible (two elements are said to be compatible if there exists a common element below both of them in the partial order). This differs from, for example, the notion of antichain in the context of trees. MA(2^{\\\\aleph_0}) is false: [0, 1] is a compact Hausdorff space, which is separable and so ccc. It has no isolated points, so points in it are nowhere dense, but it is the union of 2^{\\\\aleph_0} many points. An equivalent formulation is: If X is a compact Hausdorff topological space which satisfies the ccc then X is not the union of k or fewer nowhere dense subsets. Martin's axiom has a number of other interesting combinatorial, analytic and topological consequences: * The union of k or fewer null sets in an atomless œÉ-finite Borel measure on a Polish space is null. In particular, the union of k or fewer subsets of R of Lebesgue measure 0 also has Lebesgue measure 0. * A compact Hausdorff space X with X < 2k is sequentially compact, i.e., every sequence has a convergent subsequence. * No non-principal ultrafilter on N has a base of cardinality < k. * Equivalently for any x in Œ≤N\\\\N we have œá(x) ‚â• k, where œá is the character of x, and so œá(Œ≤N) ‚â• k. * MA(\\\\aleph_1) implies that a product of ccc topological spaces is ccc (this in turn implies there are no Suslin lines). * MA + ¬¨CH implies that there exists a Whitehead group that is not free; Shelah used this to show that the Whitehead problem is independent of ZFC. =Forcing= Forcing is a technique invented by Paul Cohen for proving consistency and independence results. It was first used, in 1963, to prove the independence of the axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis from Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory. Forcing was considerably reworked and simplified in the 1960s, and has proven to be an extremely powerful technique both within set theory and in areas of mathematical logic such as recursion theory. Intuitively, forcing consists of expanding the set theoretical universe V to a larger universe V*. In this bigger universe, for example, one might have many new subsets of œâ = {0,1,2,‚Ä¶} that were not there in the old universe, and thereby violate the continuum hypothesis. While impossible on the face of it, this is just another version of Cantor's paradox about infinity. In principle, one could consider :V^* = V \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}, \\\\, identify x \\\\in Vwith (x,0), and then introduce an expanded membership relation involving the \\"new\\" sets of the form (x,1). Forcing is a more elaborate version of this idea, reducing the expansion to the existence of one new set, and allowing for fine control over the properties of the expanded universe. See the main articles for applications such as random reals.

The album was written by all four band members at the time of release; Rick Witter, Paul Banks, Tom Gladwin and Alan Leach. The album title comes from lyrics in the song \\"Parallel Lines\\". Background and recording Shed Seven held writing and rehearsal sessions at a local potato plant, RS Cockerill's of York,A Maximum High sleevenotes prior to recording the album. One of the first tracks recorded, with their new producer Chris Sheldon, was the lead single, \\"Where Have You Been Tonight?\\", written in late 1994 and debuting live at the band's Christmas show on 23 December.Shed Seven Newsletter, April 1995 It was one of five tracks completed during a three-week recording session at RAK Studios in February 1995, before the band departed midway through the mixing process at Metropolis to embark on their first tour of Japan, satisfied with what they had achieved; Along with the lead single, they completed a further four songs during their first stint in the recording studio; \\"This Day Was Ours\\", \\"Bully Boy\\", an untitled track, which was said to be the first Shed Seven song to feature drummer Alan Leach on lead vocals, and \\"Lies\\". This version of \\"Lies\\" was previewed on an NME compilation cassette given away free with their 6 May 1995 issue, almost a year before the album was released. Following gigs in Spain and Japan, the band headed back to the studio in May 1995 to begin work on further material for inclusion on the album, which, at that point, was titled In Colour. Numerous tracks recorded in this period feature the highly renowned session musicians, The Kick Horns and The Phantom Horns, adding a brassier undertone to the featured songs and marking a notable change in sound to that of the band's previous output. Critical reception A Maximum High garnered a generally positive response from critics upon release. Ian Harrison of Select drew a number of comparisons with The Smiths in his review, summarising the album as \\"sexy, Smiths-fuelled and superb\\"; > (I)t's apparent that Shed Seven's closest inspiration isn't Northside or The > Railway Children, but The Smiths. Of all the contenders to be the heirs to > The Hated Salford Ensemble, this band pull it off with the best spirit and > the least number of groaning timbers. Continually there're the > lilting/grinding guitars √† la Marr, while Rick's voice twists and soars like > Moz pre-Brendan Behan look-alike period. He went on to liken the \\"jugular-directed guitar attacks\\" to that of their debut album, but also noted a distinct change \\"of a band trying new moves and a richer sound\\". This change of sound was also noted by Mark Sutherland, writing for the NME in April 1996, who stated that \\"the Sheds have rocketed on so far from '94's 'Change Giver', they could actually rewrite the traditional album reviewers lexicon\\" and went on to compare the band to The Stone Roses; > Certainly, the tough, ultra-confident, tune-stuffed 'outfit' here are, > Witter's emotional foghorn vocals apart, barely recognisable from the > scruffy tykes on the flashy, but ultimately unsatisfying, 'Change Giver'. > Indeed, parts of it are good enough to pass as someone else's second album: > chiefly, the record The Stone Roses should have made instead of 'The Second > Coming'. Writing for The Guardian in April 1996, Caroline Sullivan labelled A Maximum High \\"good, but not outstanding\\", as she praised guitarist Paul Banks's \\"exultant jangling\\", but found fault with the album's lyrical content. The LP has also been referred to as \\"the band's most consistently engaging album (...) full of inspirational anthems [and] excellent shout-along, arena-ready numbers.\\" Alternate editions A Maximum High Special Edition CD cover. A limited edition double CD version of the album titled A Maximum High Special Edition was released in September 1996, five months after the regular issue. It featured a bonus disc of many of the band's b-sides from their first 9 single releases, along with an alternate piano version of the album track \\"Out By My Side\\" and an expanded album cover with additional lyrics and photographs. Aside from the two UK releases, the French limited edition was issued with a free bonus disc in a cardboard slipcase featuring two live tracks‚Äî\\"Mark\\" and \\"Dolphin\\"‚Äîrecorded at the Hanover Grand, London on 30 January 1996. The former track was later issued in the UK in May 1996 as a b-side to \\"Bully Boy\\" ‚Äì the fourth single taken from A Maximum High ‚Äì whilst the latter remains exclusive to the bonus disc. The Japanese version of the album also featured additional material, a bonus track titled \\"Song Seven\\", which was to be found as a b-side on the band's UK single \\"Getting Better\\", released in January 1996. Chart performance =Album= A Maximum High spent a total of 26 weeks in the UK album chart, peaking at number 8 on 13 April 1996, with the Special Edition reissue peaking at number 13. Discounting the band's singles compilation which reached number 7 three years later, chart-wise, A Maximum High is Shed Seven's most successful album to date.

Alfred Kordelin (6 November 1868, Rauma ‚Äì 7 November 1917, Mommila, Hausj√§rvi) was a Finnish industrialist, businessman, entrepreneur, and a major philanthropist. Kordelin was one of the richest Finnish entrepreneurs of his time. Kordelin had little formal education. He was the son of a poor seaman from Rauma. Kordelin invested wisely in the fields of weaving, shipbuilding and metalworking, becoming one of Finland's richest men. Risto Ryti, who later became President of Finland, was Alfred Kordelin's legal advisor and close friend. Kordelin owned the Mommila and Jokioinen manor houses and a steammill in Reposaari. He invested a large amount of money in different companies. He built a summerhouse in Naantali, called Kultaranta. Kultaranta is currently owned by the Government of Finland, and used as the President's summer residence. Kordelin himself spent only one summer at Kultaranta. On 7 November 1917, Kordelin was kidnapped by a group of Red Guards and was murdered by a Russian sailor in the so-called Mommila skirmish that followed. Kordelin never married and was childless. Upon his death he bequeathed all his property to a Finnish cultural foundation in his will. With this money the Alfred Kordelin Foundation was later founded. The foundation gives out several million euros annually in grants and awards to promote literature, science, art, and public education in Finland.

The UWC movement originated in the ideas of the educationalist Kurt Hahn in the 1950s and the first UWC college, Atlantic College, opened in Wales in 1962. Waterford Kamhlaba was established one year later by Michael Stern, in 1963. The school's mission was similar to the philosophy of the UWC movement, and Waterford became the fourth member school of the UWC movement in 1981. History =A new multi-racial school= Waterford was founded by a group of teachers, led by the young British teacher Michael Stern, as a multi-racial school in opposition to South Africa's apartheid policies. Stern had previously been head of a school in Johannesburg, but the educational policies of the apartheid government in South Africa drove him from the country to Eswatini (then called Swaziland) where he was determined to create a new school in which students of all races could study together and cooperate in community service. The school was founded in 1963. Land on a hillside near Mbabane had been obtained through a grant from the King of Eswatini, and the main buildings were designed by Portuguese-Mozambiquean architect Am√¢ncio d'Alpoim Miranda Guedes, or Pancho Guedes. =Rising political importance= Stern and his school became a southern African legend. Nelson Mandela, still in prison, sent his daughters there, and served as Honorary President of the UWC movement from 1999. Seretse Khama, the first president of Botswana, sent his son Ian Khama, who was the fourth president; the Tutu and Sisulu families also sent their children. Another Waterford boy, Fernando Honwana, became a trusted assistant to Samora Machel of Mozambique, helping him to act as go- between in negotiations between Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs administration and the emerging African government in Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe. The school ‚Äî Stern‚Äôs idea and his creation ‚Äî became his life‚Äôs work; its balance of boys (and later girls) of all races, tribes and religions, the fulfilment of his dream. In a speech in November 1995, presenting him with a Founder‚Äôs Medal, Nelson Mandela said of time spent at Waterford that he ‚Äúdemonstrated in the worst days of apartheid, that even those who were free to enjoy the privileges of the system could ally themselves with the oppressed in the interest of non-racialism in Southern Africa‚Äù. =United World College= Waterford was established just one year after the first UWC college, UWC Atlantic College, making it the second oldest college by date of founding. Today, there are 18 UWC schools and colleges on four continents: in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada, Eswatini, the United States, Italy, Hong Kong, Norway, India, Germany, Costa Rica, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Netherlands, Japan, Thailand, Africa and China. As a UWC school, Waterford offers the IB Diploma Programme in its upper school. The entire college, including forms 1-5, is considered part of the UWC movement, although many other UWC colleges offer solely the IB Diploma Programme for students aged 16-19. Campus and student life =Campus= Waterford Kamhlaba is situated on a mountain ledge, approximately 15 minutes from the city centre of Mbabane. The sporting facilities on campus include a sports hall and gym, tennis courts, cricket, rugby and football fields. As well as a swimming pool, rock climbing wall, squash, netball and basketball courts. Furthermore, direct access to the feet of the mountains Tom and Kelly provide the students with the opportunity to go hiking and climbing. Additionally, the Waterford campus houses an IT-centre, a library, an indoor- outdoor dining hall, amphitheatre, tuck-shop, and several other halls for recreational activities. =Student life= Housing system and intramural activities Students are divided into three houses, Henderson (house colour: white), Stern (house colour: blue) and Guedes (house colour: maroon), and compete for house points in sport (inter-house athletics, theatre sports, swimming and basketball for instance). Upon the end of each academic year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup. Extracurricular activities All students are encouraged to spend at least two afternoons a week participating in extracurricular sports or other activities. Activities are supervised by members of staff, volunteers or IB students. The emphasis is on participation rather than competition, although in some disciplines it is possible to arrange competitive meetings with local schools. Examples of team sports played at Waterford include: soccer, swimming, hockey and basketball. Student organisations include Amnesty International, debating and public speaking, WIT (Waterford Improvisation Troop), ClimateKids, SAGA (Sexuality and Gender Awareness) Scouting, Link Group which is a student-led organization that arranges and organizes the cultural events on the campus and represents the UWC initiative at Waterford and Young Heroes group which raises funds for Swazi orphans and vulnerable children (http://www.youngheroes.org.sz). Community service Besides being a part of the CAS (Creativity Action and Service Programme) requirements of the IB Diploma Programme, Community Service has always been an important part of the life of the college. All IB Diploma Programme and Form 5 students take part each week in activities serving the community in Eswatini, and students in the lower forms are offered weekend Community Service activities. Current Community Service projects include the following: * Play sessions with abandoned children from Ward 8 at the Mbabane Government Hospital * Literacy classes for children from the SOS Children's Village * Construction of houses for child-headed households and grandparents caring for AIDS orphans * Ngwempisi hiking trail environmental project * Music classes with orphans and vulnerable children at the SACRO drop-in centre * Aids education through drama workshops with local primary schools * Sports and games for children from the SOS Children's Village * BraveGirl Camp, an annual student-led camp aimed at empowering 50 young women in Eswatini each year * Mpaka Peers, partnering Waterford students with students at Mpaka Refugee Camp * Indigenous tree planting and invasive tree removal on the Waterford campus * Animal spay clinics with SAWS Academics Waterford Kamhlaba's Emhlabeni (IB) Hostel =Forms 1-3= Forms 1-3 students take compulsory subjects before choosing their courses in Form Four for the IGCSE school-leaving certificate. =Forms 4-5 (IGCSE)= IGCSEs are based on a 2-year school course for 14- to 20-year-olds. They are internationally recognised as preparation for study at pre-university level (IB or A level standard), and are sufficient for entry to university in Eswatini, Lesotho, Zambia and Botswana. At Waterford Kamhlaba students may study up to ten subjects at IGCSE level, although most take between seven and nine. All students sit English Language, English Literature, Mathematics, at least one Experimental Science, one Humanity and a foreign language. Otherwise, they may choose from any of the subjects on offer at Waterford Kamhlaba. All subjects are taught in the classroom, although many (such as the Experimental Sciences, Information Technology and Art) require a degree of practical work, and some IGCSEs include assessed coursework (Music, PE Studies and Drama). =International Baccalaureate= The IB Diploma Programme is a two-year university preparatory course. It is taught in more than 1030 schools throughout the world, and is recognised in most countries as a pre-university qualification. The IB Diploma Programme requires the student to study six subjects: three at Higher and three at Standard Level. All candidates study their own and one other language, mathematics (or computer science), an experimental science, and a humanities subject. They may then select a sixth subject of their own free choice, in any academic area, including Art, Theatre or Music. In addition to the six chosen subjects, the candidate follows the Theory of Knowledge course (TOK) and writes an Extended Essay (EE) in a subject of their choice. A further part of the IB Diploma Programme is the Creativity, Action and Service programme (CAS).

He made his Test debut in December 2009 and eight months later played his first One Day International. In 2012 Watling assumed the role of wicket-keeper in Tests. Watling holds the record of most dismissals by a wicket-keeper for New Zealand and has been involved in the highest 6th and 7th wicket partnerships of New Zealand in Tests. He is the first wicket-keeper batsman to score a double hundred for New Zealand in Tests. Personal life and early cricket Born in South Africa, BJ Watling's family moved to New Zealand when he was 10 years old. While at Hamilton Boys' High School Watling was coached by former Test cricketer Chris Kuggeleijn. During his time at school, Watling won the Gillette Cup twice and he played in the Under-19 Cricket World Cup in 2004. One of his greatest achievements at Hamilton Boys' High School was contributing to a 200 + run partnership with Daniel Boughtwood, it remains a 1st XI record. Watling also scored 378 in the 2008 Hamilton senior club final, for Hamilton Old Boys against Eastern Suburbs. Domestic career Watling made his first-class debut for Northern Districts against Auckland on 6 December 2004 in the State Championship. Playing as a wicket-keeper he scored 37 in the first innings while batting number eight, but in the second innings was promoted to open the batting with Nick Horsley and was dismissed for one run. In his first two first-class for Northern Districts Watling played as a wicket-keeper, but the team wanted him to play as an opening batsman instead and 'keeping fell by the wayside. Later in December Watling made his List A debut against Wellington in the State Shield. He opened the batting with Llorne Howell and was dismissed second ball without scoring a run. In September 2019 Watling joined 2nd division Durham County Cricket Club, for the final 2 games of the County Championship. International career He was selected in New Zealand's squad to play a One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International series against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in October and November 2009. Although he was not selected in the ODI series, which New Zealand won 2‚Äì1, he made his international debut when he kept wicket in the first Twenty20 International in Dubai, which New Zealand lost by 49 runs. After showing strong form for the Knights in domestic cricket, Watling replaced Peter Fulton in New Zealand's squad for the third Test against Pakistan in December 2009. Watling opened with Tim McIntosh and they provided some uncharacteristic stability to New Zealand's opening partnership. Watling, however, was out caught after an opening stand of 60 runs. In the second innings, Watling hit an unbeaten, quickfire 60 runs from 62 balls, his first half century in Test cricket. Watling and McIntosh made an opening stand of 90 before rain ended play and any New Zealand hopes of victory. On 13 August 2010 Watling made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in the 2010 Triangular series. He opened the batting and top-scored for New Zealand with 55 runs from 68 deliveries in a three-wicket defeat. When Zimbabwe toured New Zealand in January 2012, incumbent wicket-keeper Reece Young was dropped because he did not score enough runs in the previous Test against Australia. Watling and Kruger van Wyk were the front runners for the position, and Watling was eventually given the gloves for the one-off Test. His first six Tests were as a specialist batsman. Though he had kept wicket in both the T20Is he had played and two ODIs, at the time Watling had kept wicket in just two first-class matches, both of which were in 2004. New Zealand won the Test by an innings and Watling scored his first Test century, making 102 runs in the first innings. On his return to the domestic circuit with Northern Districts, Watling assumed the role of wicket-keeper to gain more experience. A hip injury prevent Watling from participating in the first Test against South Africa in March, and he was replaced by Kruger van Wyk. Watling would finally cement his place in the New Zealand test side during the 2012/13 tour of South Africa. In a tough series for New Zealand's batsmen, Watling scored 168 runs, including back to back 50's in the second test. Dale Steyn offered praise for Watling, saying \\"He is a good player and he doesn't want to give his wicket away. He is a typical wicket-keeper batsman and...is a very gutsy player.\\" Watling performed credibly on New Zealand's home and away series against England, and then scored his second test century on New Zealand's 2013 tour of Bangladesh. On 16‚Äì17 February 2014 Watling scored 124 runs against India. His 352 run partnership with New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was at the time the highest sixth wicket stand in test cricket history. This record was surpassed on 5‚Äì6 January 2015 by Watling and Kane Williamson with an unbroken 365 run partnership before a declaration against Sri Lanka at Wellington's Basin Reserve. Both players posted their highest test scores, with Williamson not out on 242 and Watling not out on 142. Watling has also been involved in four of the seven highest 200+ run 6th-wicket partnerships in the team's history. Watling and Williamson's 365-run partnership was the highest 6th wicket stand until surpassed by the 399-run partnership of England players Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow on 3 January 2016. In 2015, he became stand-in captain for Black Caps for the tour against England while many players are still fulfilling his duties in the Indian Premier League. During the first test against England, he suffered an injury that stopped him from keeping behind the wickets in the second innings and most of the first innings on the field, and was moved to the outfield. His gloves were given to Tom Latham. In the second test, playing as a no. 8 batsman only, with Luke Ronchi making his test debut behind the wickets, he became the first New Zealand player to ever score a century at Headingley. In the first test against Sri Lanka in the 2015-2016 Sri Lanka's tour to New Zealand, Watling took his 100th dismissal with his first catch of the match, and went on to take his 100th catch to finish with nine catches for the match, a New Zealand record he shares with Brendon McCullum, who has already given up wicket-keeping. In May 2018, he was one of twenty players to be awarded a new contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by New Zealand Cricket. In March 2019, while playing test match against Bangladesh at Hamilton, Watling took his 202nd dismissal, the most for a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Tests, surpassing Adam Parore's record of 201. In November 2019, while playing test match against England at Bay Oval, Watling scored his maiden double century and became the first wicket-keeper batsman for New Zealand and 9th in the history of test cricket to score double century. His 261-run partnership with Mitchell Santner became the highest ever 7th wicket partnership for New Zealand in tests, by beating the previous record of 225 by Chris Cairns and Jacob Oram against South Africa at Eden Park in 2004. Playing style While Watling mostly bats at lower-middle order, he opens for Northern Districts in Twenty20 as a pure batsman. According to Watling he consciously modeled his batting on that of South African international Jonty Rhodes: \\"He wasn't the biggest hitter, more an accumulator. He hit well to the gaps and ran well between wickets. It's kind of how I like to play, or at least develop my game to be like.\\" Watling has the best averages and high scores in Basin Reserve, and tends to score more individual runs when the team is not doing well.

Capabilities  Most ICR software has a self-learning system referred to as a neural network, which automatically updates the recognition database for new handwriting patterns. It extends the usefulness of scanning devices for the purpose of document processing, from printed character recognition (a function of OCR) to hand-written matter recognition. Because this process is involved in recognising hand writing, accuracy levels may, in some circumstances, not be very good but can achieve 97%+ accuracy rates in reading handwriting in structured forms. Often to achieve these high recognition rates several read engines are used within the software and each is given elective voting rights to determine the true reading of characters. In numeric fields, engines which are designed to read numbers take preference, while in alpha fields, engines designed to read hand written letters have higher elective rights. When used in conjunction with a bespoke interface hub, hand-written data can be automatically populated into a back office system avoiding laborious manual keying and can be more accurate than traditional human data entry. = Automated Forms Processing = An important development of ICR was the invention of Automated Forms Processing in 1993 by Joseph Corcoran who was awarded a patent on the invention. This involved a three- stage process of capturing the image of the form to be processed by ICR and preparing it to enable the ICR engine to give best results, then capturing the information using the ICR engine and finally processing the results to automatically validate the output from the ICR engine. This application of ICR increased the usefulness of the technology and made it applicable for use with real world forms in normal business applications. Modern software applications use ICR as a technology of recognizing text in forms filled in by hand (hand- printed).  Intelligent word recognition  Intelligent word recognition (IWR) can recognize and extract not only printed-handwritten information, but cursive handwriting as well. ICR recognizes on the character-level, whereas IWR works with full words or phrases. Capable of capturing unstructured information from every day pages, IWR is said to be more evolved than hand print ICR. Not meant to replace conventional ICR and OCR systems, IWR is optimized for processing real-world documents that contain mostly free-form, hard-to-recognize data fields that are inherently unsuitable for ICR. This means that the highest and best use of IWR is to eliminate a high percentage of the manual entry of handwritten data and run-on hand print fields on documents that otherwise could be keyed only by humans.

Playing career As a youth, Milley played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Red Wings minor ice hockey team. Milley was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the 2nd round, 47th overall, in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. After finishing his prolific junior career with the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League, Milley was signed to an entry-level contract by the Sabres. Over 5 seasons with the Sabres, Milley played in just 15 games, primarily playing with Buffalo's American Hockey League affiliate, the Rochester Americans. In the 2003‚Äì04 playoffs with the Americans, Milley scored a memorable series clinching goal on May 1, 2004. With Rochester trailing 3-1 to the Syracuse Crunch in the first round of the AHL playoffs, Rochester won the next two games to tie the series at 3-3. In game seven, Milley clinched the comeback for the Americans in the first overtime. On August 18, 2005, Milley signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Milley scored his first NHL goal and in 14 games with the Lightning recorded 3 points. For the majority of his contract with Tampa, Milley was again assigned to the AHL with the Springfield Falcons and later the Norfolk Admirals. Milley left for Europe for the 2008‚Äì09 season, signing a one-year contract with Grizzly Adams Wolfsburg of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. With Milley scoring among the leaders on Wolfsburg he was quickly signed to a two-year extension on December 18, 2008. After seven prolific seasons with Wolfsburg, three as co-captain, Milley left the club as a free agent to sign a two-year contract with D√ºsseldorfer EG on April 7, 2015. At the conclusion of his second year with D√ºsseldorfer in the 2016‚Äì17 season, having contributed with just 10 points in 41 games, Milley opted to end his professional career after 17 seasons. Personal life He is married to Katie Hindle Milley and they have a son, Noah, who was born April 11, 2007 and a daughter.

Reflexive monism bridges the materialist/dualist divide by noting that, in terms of their phenomenology, experiences of the external world are none other than the physical world-as-experienced, thereby placing aspects of human consciousness in the external phenomenal world, rather than exclusively within the head or brain. A similar point of departure is adopted in much of European phenomenology. The theory then explores the consequences of this point of departure for a different understanding of various conventional ways of distinguishing mental from physical phenomena, such as internal versus external phenomena, private versus public phenomena, subjective versus objective phenomena, and the world-as-experienced versus the world as described by physics. The theory also combines facets of realism (for the existence of reality per se), with idealism (for the existence of the phenomenal world), which falls short of avowing the necessity of perception to the existence of reality per se (the principle of \\"esse est percipi\\").Blackmore, S.

(2006) Inner Presence: Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon. Cambridge: MIT Press. Velmans has around 100 publications in the area of consciousness studies in which he develops this basic point of departure into a general theory that addresses the many problems of consciousness, including Understanding Consciousness (2000, 2009), and Towards a Deeper Understanding of Consciousness (2017). In his map of prominent theories of consciousness Francisco Varela categorises Velmans' work as non-reductionist, stressing the importance of first-person accounts of the phenomenology of consciousness,Varela, F. J. (1999) Present time consciousness.

After attending Sydney Boy's High School, he studied Electrical Engineering at St. Andrews College at the University of Sydney, where he received his B.Eng in 1963. In the evening he attended psychology classes at the University of Sydney for another two years, before moving to Europe. After several years of research and development he received his PhD in Psychology from Bedford College in 1974.Extracts from the Introduction to Velmans, M. (2017) Toward a Deeper Understanding of Consciousness: Selected works of Max Velmans. World Library of Psychologists Series, London: Routledge/Psychology Press, pp. 1-15 (of 22) After his graduation in 1963 Velmans had started his career designing electrical circuits at the electronics laboratory of the Australian engineering company EMAIL Ltd. After half a year he moved to systems analyses of business and industrial systems at the new information technology department. After touring through Europe in 1966 he became affiliated with Bedford College, University of London to pursue research for his PhD. In 1968 he was appointed to a lectureship in the new Psychology Department at Goldsmiths College, University of London, eventually to a personal chair in Psychology, and from 2006 to Emeritus Professor of Psychology. Velmans co-founded the Consciousness and Experiential Psychology Section of the British Psychological Society in 1994, and served as its chair from 2003 to 2006. He was appointed National Visiting Professor for 2010‚Äì2011 by the Indian Council of Philosophical Research, and in 2011 was elected to a Fellowship of the British Academy of Social Sciences.

Theory & Psychology 12(3), pp. 415‚Äì417. http://www.psych.ucalgary.ca/thpsyc/Reviews12(3).pdf Reflexive monism presents itself as an alternative to both dualism and reductionism. It states that it does not make sense to speak of phenomenological experiences of reality as occurring solely within the brain, given that some of them quite clearly occur within the experienced world itself (for example, asked to point to an external light as-experienced, almost all rational subjects would point to the light that is experienced rather than to the brain, which is where, according to dualists and reductionists, the experience actually takes place). Thus, Velmans argues, the relationship between subjects and experienced reality is reflexive: some experiences apprehended by the subject are quite clearly placed \\"in the world\\" by the perceiving mind. The contents of consciousness are, thus, not exclusively in the brain, but often in the perceived physical world itself; in fact, in terms of phenomenology, there is no clear and distinct difference between what we normally think of as the \\"physical world\\", the \\"phenomenal world\\" and the \\"world as perceived\\".Velmans, M. (2009) Understanding Consciousness, Edition 2. Routledge/Psychology Press, p. 298 He writes: > This sketch of how consciousness fits into the wider universe supports a > form of non-reductive, Reflexive Monism. Human minds, bodies and brains are > embedded in a far greater universe. Individual conscious representations are > perspectival. That is, the precise manner in which entities, events and > processes are translated into experiences depends on the location in space > and time of a given observer, and the exact mix of perceptual, cognitive, > affective, social, cultural and historical influences which enter into the > 'construction' of a given experience. In this sense, each conscious > construction is private, subjective, and unique. Taken together, the > contents of consciousness provide a view of the wider universe, giving it > the appearance of a 3D phenomenal world. ... However, such conscious > representations are not the thing-itself. In this vision, there is one > universe (the thing-itself), with relatively differentiated parts in the > form of conscious beings like ourselves, each with a unique, conscious view > of the larger universe of which it is a part. In so far as we are parts of > the universe that, in turn, experience the larger universe, we participate > in a reflexive process whereby the universe experiences itself.\\" =Changing Places= The changing places thought experiment is one of many conceived by Velmans, discussed in Understanding Consciousness. The experiment was designed to demonstrate the difficulties in distinguishing phenomenologically between a \\"subjective\\" first-person experience of a given event or object and a third-person \\"objective\\" observation of the same event or object. It also throws doubt on the supposed contrast between the \\"subjectivity\\" of a subject's experience and the supposed \\"objectivity\\" of an external observer's observations of the neural correlates of that experience in the subject's brain. Velmans conceives of a situation in which an experimenter (\\"E\\") is observing a subject (\\"S\\") exposed to a light stimulus. The differences between the two viewpoints, Velmans argues, is primarily derived from a difference in interest, reflected in a difference in their required activities. To explain, during the experiment S is required only to report on her experiences of the light, which she needs to communicate to E in an appropriate manner. E, on the other hand, is interested primarily in S's experience of the light, and thus E's focus is not just on the light (which he thinks of as a \\"stimulus\\") but also on the observable events in S's brain, and on S's reports concerning what she experiences. Thus, E is interested first and foremost in the subject's experience, and how these relate to the light stimulus and brain states of S that he can observe. In such a case, E's experience of events would be considered \\"objective\\" or \\"public\\", while S's experiences are \\"subjective\\" and \\"private\\"; while E's focus is on recording the neural causes and correlates of visual experiences, S is interested only in reporting about such experiences. However, Velmans points out that all that would be required for S and E to exchange roles is for them to change their respective foci (as he puts it \\"S and E merely have to turn their heads\\"), so that E focuses exclusively on the light and reports his experiences, while S focuses her attention not just on the light, but on the events in E's brain and his reports of the experience. In such a situation, S becomes the experimenter and E becomes the subject; thus, following current conventions, \\"S would now be entitled to think of her observations (of the light and E's brain) as 'public and objective' and to regard E's experiences of the light as 'private and subjective'.\\" *Harman, W. (1993) Towards an Adequate Epistemology for the Scientific Exploration of Consciousness Journal of Scientific Exploration, 7 (2), pp. 133‚Äì143. Velmans points out that this outcome is patently absurd, as the phenomenology of the light (that is, the way it is experienced) remains the same from the perspective of S or E, whether it is thought of as being an observed stimulus or a subjective experience. Nothing has changed in the nature of the light that either party can observe, save in the contextualising focus of their interests. That is, Velmans concludes, there is no phenomenological difference between publicly observed phenomena and private, subjective experiences. This becomes a point of departure for a more nuanced analysis of subjectivity, intersubjectivity and objectivity, and ultimately for an epistemology for the study of consciousness that, according to Velmans, fits psychology smoothly into science.

Geography Manly is located approximately east of the Brisbane central business district. Surrounding suburbs are Wynnum (to the north), Lota to the South and Manly West (to the west). To the east lies Moreton Bay. History Estate map of Manly Beach, 1887 This part of Moreton Bay was originally occupied by the semi-nomadic Mipirimm subclan of the Quandamooka people. Manly and neighbouring suburb Lota were and continue to be known together as Narlung to the Quandamooka people, likely meaning 'the place of long shadows'. European settlement of the Manly area first took place from 1859 when the land was surveyed and Thomas Jones obtained a land grant of . Joseph Lewthwaite built the first house in the area, a stone homestead he called Wyvernleigh at what is now the intersection of Oceana Terrace and Kooralgin Street; it would later also be known as Tingalpa House. What is now Manly was known as Wyvernleigh and managed as part of the Lewthwaite's estate, which included a sugar plantation. Aboriginal connection to the Manly area continued throughout the colonial period, with town camps recorded in Manly and Wynnum, and local Aboriginal groups running fishing, oyster-catching and turtle-hunting expeditions from the area into the 1920s. In 1882 the land was sold by auction by James R. Dickson for the Manly Beach Estate, apparently named after Manly, New South Wales beach in Sydney. It comprised 177 allotments of about bounded by Arnold Street (the northern part of which is now Cambridge Parade) to the north and north-west, Moreton Bay to the east, Spring Street (now Falcon Street) to the south, and Ernest Street to the south-west. In 1885, James R. Dickson auctioned a further subdivision of 700 lots to the north of the 1882 land sale, bounded to the north-west by Gordon Parade, to the south-west by Mountjoy Crescent, to the south by Cambridge Parade and to east by Moreton Bay. The advertising mentioned the forthcoming railway. However, the 1885 land sale was evidently not successful as 400 blocks in that subdivision were offered in a \\"continuation sale\\" in January 1887. In 1889 a railway line was opened that provided a direct service to the state capital, Brisbane; it would subsequently be extended to be the present Cleveland line. By the early 1900s the area had become a popular seaside location. In June 1890, 395 subdivided allotments of the Manly Beach Estate was auctioned by Arthur Martin & Co. This was the third and final section of the estate. A map advertising the auction shows the estate was close to Manly Railway Station and Ernest Street. Manly State School opened on 4 July 1910. The Manly War Memorial was unveiled in a park at 184 Carlton Street by Walter Henry Barnes, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, on 5 March 1921. The memorial, originally of Helidon brown freestone on a base of Enoggera granite, with a statue of Carrara marble, honours the 16 local men who fell during the First World War. In June 1925 the homestead Wyvernleigh/Tingalpa House, by then on a site bounded by Oceana Terrace, Kooralgin Street, and Ernest Street, was bought by James Duhig, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane to be used for the building of a Roman Catholic church and school. Duhig announced that the church would be named after St John Baptist Vianney. The homestead was used for church services until 1927, after which it was demolished to be replaced by a parish hall. On 20 September 1930 Archbishop Duhig performed the stump capping ceremony on the new church hall; the hall appears to be completed by May 1931. Later the hall was consecrated as a church. The well-sheltered coastal location of Manly has resulted in it becoming a popular location for boating. In 1958 Manly Boat Harbour was built. Large tidal walls were constructed to the north and south with dredging being undertaken to deepen the harbour. The silt that was recovered in this process was brought ashore and used in the construction of the parks and parking areas around the harbour. In 2000 the Queensland Place Names Board named Norfolk Point () which was on reclaimed land in the Manly boat harbour in Moreton Bay after the sloop Norfolk commanded by Matthew Flinders in his exploration of the Moreton Bay. The naming was triggered by a recreation of the trip by a replica of the Norfolk. A plaque on the point commemorates the naming. Heritage listings Manly has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 184 Carlton Terrace: Manly War Memorial * Falcon Street: Manly Retaining Wall * 150 Kingsley Terrace: Michael Gannon residence Boating Manly Boat Harbour is not even the largest boat harbour facility in Queensland. It has two boat ramps at both ends just like Scarborough Boat Harbour which is only marginally smaller. A number of boating clubs are based in Manly including the Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron, the Wynnum Manly Yacht Club, the Moreton Bay Trailer Boat Club, and the Darling Point Sailing Squadron (which shares space with the Multi-Hull Club of Australia, and the charity for handicapped people known as Sailability). Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron, Wynnum Manly Yacht Club and Moreton Bay Trailer Boat club have floating marinas, dry boat storage facilities and boat maintenance yards for use by members. There is one commercial marina in the harbour, East Coast Marina, also offering floating berths, undercover boat storage and a boat maintenance yard. Brisbane Coast Guard (a Flotilla of the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard Association) also has its Flotilla Base in Manly Boat Harbour, at 40 Trafalgar Street, near the harbour entrance. This Flotilla, the largest in Australia, has the Lord Mayor of Brisbane as its Patron. It was formed in 1972 and continues to operate duty rosters every weekend and public holiday, with its emergency services on call 24/7. Demographics Over 43% of households in this area consist of couples without children and a further 37% are couples with children. Stand-alone houses account for 67% of all dwellings in this area, with townhouses accounting for a further 10%. The median house price in Manly for the 2004 calendar year was $510,000. Federally, the people of Manly are represented by Ross Vasta MP (elected 2010) in the seat of Bonner. In the the population of Manly was 3,702, 50.4% female and 49.6% male. The median age of the Manly population was 42 years of age, 5 years above the Australian median. 73.1% of people living in Manly were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 6.7%, New Zealand 5.6%, Scotland 0.8%, United States of America 0.7%, Ireland 0.6%. 90.2% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.5% French, 0.4% Tagalog, 0.3% Dutch, 0.3% Cantonese, 0.3% Thai.

Early life and education Frederick Spurrell was born at 23, Park Street in Southwark at a time when his father, Charles Spurrell (1783‚Äì1866), was employed by Barclay, Perkins & Co. as a senior manager at the nearby Anchor Brewery. His mother, Hannah Shears (1790‚Äì1882), was the daughter of the London copper merchant James Shears. In the 1830s the family moved to Anchor Terrace on Southwark Bridge Road.J. C. Spurrell, The life of Charles Spurrell and his family's links to the Watney and Gray brewing families, Brewery History No. 138 (December 2010). He studied at King's College London and was awarded an Associateship (A.K.C.), before going up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he obtained a B.A. in 1847 (promoted to M.A. in 1850). At university he was a member of both the Cambridge Camden Society and the Cambridge Architectural Society. Career and interests St Germanus' Church, Faulkbourne, where Spurrell was rector from 1853 to 1898. Spurrell was ordained deacon by the Bishop of Chichester in 1847 and priest the following year, when he began his work as curate of Newhaven, Sussex. While there, he was among a small party of local officials that called on Louis-Philippe I, who had fled to England following the 1848 revolutions in France. In 1849 Spurrell travelled through Belgium, Prussia and Denmark to Sweden, having been sent by the Bishop of London, the Rt. Rev. Charles James Blomfield to served as the Anglican chaplain in Stockholm. He provided weekly services in the upper gallery of a chapel at 12 Lilla Tr√§dg√•rdsgatan, which had been loaned by the Moravian Church.J. C. Spurrell, Frederick Spurrell‚Äôs letter from Stockholm, 1849, The Anglo-Swedish Society newsletter (2015). Following his return to England, he served as curate of Barcombe, Sussex, from 1850 to 1853. Spurrell was appointed rector of Faulkbourne, Essex, in 1853, where he remained until his retirement in 1898, having been made a surrogate in the Diocese of St Albans in 1894. In 1886 he commissioned Arthur Blomfield to restore the parish church. Spurrell was a keen amateur archaeologist who published a number of papers. He was a member of the Essex Archaeological Society and the Sussex Archaeological Society, and also served on the Council of the Royal Archaeological Society alongside prominent Victorian archaeologists such as Augustus Pitt Rivers and Flinders Petrie.J. C. Spurrell, Frederick Spurrell, An Essex Antiquarian, Essex Society for Archaeology and History newsletter (2015). He died in Bath in 1902 and was buried in the churchyard of St Germanus' Church, Faulkbourne. Family Spurrell married his cousin, Frances Gray (1827‚Äì1892), at Newhaven on 16 February 1854. Frances‚Äôs father, John Gray (1790‚Äì1826), had founded the Gray and Dacre Brewery in West Ham, Essex, and her mother, Lydia Shears (1794‚Äì1855), was the youngest daughter of the copper merchant James Shears. They had two sons (one stillborn) and three daughters. Their surviving son, the Rev. Charles Henry Spurrell, was for many years as Organising Secretary of the National Society for Promoting Religious Education and later served as Rector of Meesden, Hertfordshire, from 1911 to 1923. Frederick Spurrell was descended from the Spurrell family of Norfolk. He was the uncle of the archaeologist and egyptologist Flaxman Charles John Spurrell and a cousin of the Rev. Augustus Shears and the Rev. Ernest Henry Shears.

Built by CGF Gallet (producer of the F1 helmet for firemen), it weighs , is available in three sizes, and is made from ultra-high-molecular- weight polyethylene Spectra fibers, produced under license from Honeywell. The SPECTRA helmet can stop shell fragments of travelling at , an 80% improvement over the Mod√®le 1978 helmet it replaced.  History  The first models were made for United Nations peacekeeping operations, and were blue in the mass. The SPECTRA helmet is the result of studies conducted in the 1990s, intended to design the helmet for the French Army of the 2000s. In 1992, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia placed large numbers of French troops in contact with well-trained and well-equipped forces, especially snipers during the Siege of Sarajevo, where heavier protection than the Mod√®le 1978 helmet proved necessary. The Army requested an emergency study for the new helmet, and tests were made, which selected the Dyneema fiber. Gallet drafted a model based on the Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT or Fritz) helmet used by the United States Army, and produced a first series of 5,000 which was immediately made available to the blue helmets in the former Yugoslavia. These first models were mostly blue in color. Later models used the NATO green color. They gradually equipped all French troops, with priority given to units on missions in foreign territories. This completely replaced all the 1978 helmets in French service. At one point, it was tested by the Uruguayan military, but it was not adopted.  Description  The helmet is made of Spectra fibre. It is not bulletproof against rifle or carbine bullets. It is a fragmentation-resistant helmet with a maximum distortion (loss of shape) of from a 9mm full metal jacket bullet (FMJ) of 8 g (124 gr) travelling on impact. It has a resistance to fragments that meets NATO Standardised Regulation (STANAG) 2920, V50 mini, which is . Resistance to shock-impact meets protection standard EN397 for industrial helmets. The helmet can be worn with earmuffs and an individual radio system. Further equipment, like night vision, can be added. The new infantry combat equipment of the French army, the F√©lin system, is partly based on development of the SPECTRA helmet. Variants =M/96= In the early 1990s, the Danish army began looking for a replacement to the old US M1 helmet designated M/46 Steel helmet, which had been the standard helmet in Denmark since World War 2. The M/96 helmet was officially brought into service in 1996 as the M/96. Helmet covers The removable helmet cover allows to change the pattern of the camouflage. For instance, the Danish army uses three different covers: * Helmet cover \\"Dk- version\\". An early version produced probably locally in Denmark. Almost identical to the CGF Gallet 900076 version but with no rubber rim, instead it has a drawstring to keep it tight to the helmet. The loops of the drawstrings on top of the helmet sometimes are quite big. M/84 camouflage pattern. Still in use in some places until roughly 1998 or 1999. *M/96 Helmet cover.

In India, this species has been observed in the following areas: Ramnad, Adyar, Chennai, Mayiladuthurai, Madurai, Thanjavur, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin, and Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary. In Sri Lanka, it has been reported in Marichhukate in Northern Province.  Natural History  Nocturnal in habit, they are found under rocks during daytime. At night, they are seen on the open ground, moving about with an upright stance. Females with two eggs have been observed in July and between December- February. They are found in dry habitats including along the coastal sand dunes. Individuals are thought to be territorial with two males making a 'chirping call' accompanied by an arched body, stretched legs and waving their tails while lunging at the neck of the other individual occasionally.  Evolutionary history  In the absence of molecular evidence, this species was incorrectly assigned to different genera however, recent phylogenetic analysis has placed this species in the genus Hemidactylus.This species is thought to have diverged from its common ancestor around 35 million years ago and its range expansion into Sri Lanka is likely to have happened in the Late Miocene.

In the background is the bloomery (Rennofen), in front of it a bloom is being coarsely freed of dross. In the near foreground, the bloom is being forged under the hammer.Agricola, Georgius (1556): De re metallica libri XII. - Basel. A hammer mill, hammer forge or hammer works was a workshop in the pre-industrial era that was typically used to manufacture semi-finished, wrought iron products or, sometimes, finished agricultural or mining tools, or military weapons. The feature that gave its name to these workshops was the water-driven trip hammer, or set of hammers, used in the process. The shaft, or 'helve', of the hammer was pivoted in the middle and the hammer head was lifted by the action of cams set on a rotating camshaft that periodically depressed the end of the shaft. As it rose and fell, the head of the hammer described an arc. The face of the hammer was made of iron for durability.. Erl√§uterung \\"Verst√§hlen\\". At www.enzyklo.de. Retrieved 8 March 2013.  Hammer mills  Innere Krampen hammer mill, lithograph c. 1830, J.F.Kaiser, Graz, Austria These mills, which were original driven by water wheels, but later also by steam power, became increasingly common as tools became heavier over time and therefore more difficult to manufacture by hand. The hammer mills smelted iron ore using charcoal in so-called bloomeries (Georgius Agricola 1556, Rennherden, Rennfeuer or Rennofen: from Rinnen = \\"rivulets\\" of slag or Zrennherd from Zerrinnen = \\"to melt away\\"). In these smelting ovens, which were equipped with bellows also driven by water power, the ore was melted into a glowing clump of soft, raw iron, fluid slag and charcoal remnants. The iron was not fluid as it would be in a modern blast furnace, but remained a doughy, porous lump mainly due to the presence of liquid slag. These lumps of sponge iron, known historically as \\"blooms\\" were initially compacted by hand using a sledgehammer. After that they were forged several times, usually with the trip hammer or with sledgehammers until all the slag and charcoal had been removed. For that, the iron was heated in another forge oven or smith's hearth. The iron could then be directly used as soft iron. A further improvement process, such as fining as used in blast furnace operations, was not needed. The resulting coarse bar iron was then further worked externally e.g. in special, small hammer works (Zainhammer) into thin iron rods, (e.g. thick wire), so- called rod iron (Zaineisen), which was needed by nailsmiths to produce nails. Further processing into so-called refined iron or into \\"elastic\\" steel for e.g. for sword blades, was carried out by specialised refined iron hammer forges or by blacksmiths on site.  Distribution  Geographically, hammer mills were dependent on the availability of water power. At the same time, there had to be forests nearby to produce the large quantities of charcoal needed. In addition, there had to be deposits of iron ore in the vicinity in order to ensure that there was only a short distance to transport the iron- containing ores to the smelteries. Finally, agricultural land was needed in order to feed the many craftsmen involved. = Germany = Hammer mills were widespread from the late Middle Ages in the following regions: * Bergisches Land (with more than one hundred sitesHerbert Nicke: Bergische M√ºhlen ‚Äì Auf den Spuren der Wasserkraftnutzung im Land der tausend M√ºhlen zwischen Wupper und Sieg; Galunder; Wiehl; 1998; .) * Upper Palatinate, especially in the area of the towns of Amberg and Sulzbach * Thuringian Forest: Lauterhammer and Niederhammer in Suhl by 1363, Tobiashammer in Ohrdruf (later also Kupferhammer and copper hammer mill) * Fichtel Mountains * Ore Mountains: 1352 Hammer in Pleil, c. 1380 Hammer Erla, Frohnauer Hammer * Harz Mountains * Siegerland on the Sieg river (today around Siegen) * Sauerland around Hagen * Lahn-Dill Region and on the upper Eder river In these regions there were iron ore deposits, which could be extracted with the means available at the time. There was a higher density in the Wupperviereck, where there were several hundred sites. The Upper Palatinate was one of the European centres of iron smelting and its many hammer mills led to its nickname as the \\"Ruhrgebiet of the Middle Ages\\". Placenames with the suffix -hammer are very common in this region. The home of the lord in charge of a hammer mill was rather grandly known as a \\"hammer castle\\" or \\"hammer palace\\" (Hammerschloss). This usually inconspicuous schloss, which acted as the family seat of the \\"hammer lord\\", was generally located in the immediate vicinity of the mill. Important hammer castles may be seen along the Bavarian Iron Route, for example in Theuern, Dietldorf and Schmidm√ºhlenKlaus Altenbuchner, Michael A. Schmid: Das Hammerschloss in Schmidm√ºhlen.

It was released on VHS on May 26, 1993 in the United States. The film was George Maharis's last role. Plot The story follows Holly Gooding (Drew Barrymore), who moves from New York City to Los Angeles after being implicated in a murder. She is followed by what is apparently her evil twin. While in Los Angeles, she finds a room for rent by a writer named Patrick (George Newbern). After some strange occurrences, it becomes less and less clear whether the woman is in fact Holly or her doppelg√§nger. Patrick soon starts to realize something is odd about Holly. As he spends more and more time with her, things heat up and he falls for her. He then finds out that Holly's brother, Fred, is in a psychiatric hospital after killing his own father. When Patrick finds out that Holly's mother was murdered and she is the prime suspect, he starts doubting her sanity. But by that time he is too attached to her and does not want her going to jail. So when her brother Fred is attacked and she once more is a suspect he decides he is going to get to the bottom of it, no matter what. At the end it is revealed that Holly has a split personality and absorbed a vanishing twin as a fetus in the womb. Also, it is her psychiatrist, Dr. Heller, that is responsible for all of Holly's misfortunes, having convinced Holly's alternate personality to murder her mother (who was planning to kill Holly for her money), and also having used a variety of disguises and latex masks to impersonate Holly and numerous other figures in Patrick's investigation in order to gaslight Holly as well as frame her for additional murders. Just as Dr. Heller is about to kill Patrick, Holly undergoes a bizarre supernatural transformation in which she splits into two partially unformed beings, one of which knocks the other one unconscious and kills Dr. Heller. The creature looks like it's about to kill Patrick, but spares him and remerges with the other creature to reform into Holly. The film ends with both Patrick and Holly recovering in the hospital.

Richard (November 1 1940 - October 22 2003) and Enid (n√©e Pratt; October 25 1941 - October 22 2003) worked as aid workers to Somalia, working on educational projects until their murders in 2003.  Southern Africa  From 1971 to 1995, the Eyeingtons worked at the world-famous Waterford Kamhlaba, a multiracial secondary school in Swaziland which was opened by Michael Stern after the introduction of apartheid laws in 1948. Many South African children ‚Äì black and white, rich and poor ‚Äì were educated there and the school became renowned as a beacon of liberalism during apartheid. Dick joined Waterford as a geography teacher, becoming head of geography, deputy head and finally, in 1984, headmaster. Enid also taught at the school, becoming the school nurse and head of hostels, as well as running the school's community services programme. Increasingly, she focused on nursing, setting up clinics for women and HIV sufferers and working with the community. The couple were passionate anti-apartheid campaigners and, during Dick's tenure, they fostered an ethos of egalitarianism, creating a school that encouraged tolerance and vigorous debate. ANC and United Democratic Front speakers were brought from South Africa, and scholarships were set up for black South African students from the townships. Dick taught the three daughters of Nelson Mandela, who remained a close friend. His pupils also included Archbishop Desmond Tutu's children, and the future Swazi king Mswati III. The actor Richard E Grant was also taught by Dick, and describes the couple as \\"completely and utterly dedicated to education in Africa\\". Recalling an unforgettable field trip with them to Lesotho where they found dinosaur footprints in the Lava Mountains, Mr Grant says that the lives of many students ‚Äúwere enriched by knowing these two extraordinary, unique and inspired individuals.\\" Richard Attenborough visited the school when he was in South Africa making Cry Freedom and became a trustee and a close friend of the Eyeingtons. Reflecting on their life and work, Lord Attenborough said, ‚ÄúI have never known two people who so consistently put their beliefs into action‚Ä¶ the good they did during their lifetime today resonates in a multitude of hearts and minds and will continue to do so for many generations to come.  SOS Sheikh Secondary School  In September 2002, Dick and Enid moved to Somaliland to take on the SOS Sheikh Secondary School, which is situated near Sheikh in a remote part of the central Somaliland, and a three hours‚Äô drive from the region's capital, Hargeisa. The once-renowned boarding school was established in British Somaliland. It was mostly destroyed in fighting in 1989, and had fallen into further disrepair during the Somali civil war. By the time SOS set about restoring the school, it had been completely looted and then reduced to frameless structures standing in an open yard. Following years of closure, the SOS Sheikh Secondary School reopened in January 2003 to its first 53 pupils. Many of the 45 boys and 8 girls who started at the school in 2003 had previously been denied any education by the civil war and the interclan fighting that followed it in this war-torn country. Another 50 pupils arrived in September 2003. Death Gunmen killed the Eyeingtons in October 2003. They were shot as they watched television at their home in the compound of the recently reopened school. Two weeks before their murders, Italian humanitarian Annalena Tonelli was killed in Borama by the same Islamist gunmen cell called al-Itihaad al-Islamiya.

Structure  A blind date is arranged for by a mutual acquaintance of both participants. The two people who take part in the blind date have never met or seen each other, hence the phrase \\"blind date\\". Therefore, it is the responsibility of the person who arranges the date to ensure that they are a good match. Sometimes one person is more interested in the match than the other, which may make it more difficult on the person arranging the date to judge whether the date will be successful. The date is usually two hours or less, as it is just a first date and is really meant to introduce the two people more than it is meant to create a marriage. Furthermore, due to the unfamiliarity of the two people the date is shorter than most because they are in the beginning stages of a relationship. The date is also very adventurous in the way that neither party knows what to expect and whether or not they will hit it off. The location of the date is also affected by the spontaneity in that it is often a neutral and public place so that both parties feel comfortable. =Online dating= Family and friends have been declining in their influence over the dating market for the past 60 years. In the past 15 years, the rise of the Internet has also displaced the neighborhood, the workplace, and the circle of friends as sources of dating partners. As of May 2013, it was estimated that 11% of adult Americans had used online dating websites or mobile dating applications, and 59% of American Internet users agreed that online dating was a good way to meet people. China's largest online dating site reported over 100 million users in September 2013. For couples that have been together for more than a year, the choice of venue (online vs. real life) had little influence on relationship success. Online dating services ask questions in the form of a survey in order to get to know the user better and to understand what they are looking for in a relationship. Using the information given, the matching users would be found based on various algorithms. The users are then enabled to communicate with each other. According to a study done by Match.com, in an effort to determine how much impact their services are having on the way relationships develop today, \\"17% of couples married in the last 3 years, or 1 in 6, met each other on an online dating site\\" and \\"1 out of 5 single people have dated someone they met on an online dating site\\".(2010). Match.com and Chadwick Martin Bailey 2009 - 2010 Studies: Recent Trends: Online Dating Retrieved from http://cp.match.com/cppp/media/CMB_Study.pdf There are thousands of online dating websites. The most popular ones are eHarmony with 20 million profiles and Match.com with 15 million profiles.

This process begins by the parents sitting on a bench with their child‚Äôs credentials, such as photos and academic or career information. After information has been exchanged and the parents like what they see, questions are asked about anything ranging from their child‚Äôs zodiac sign to their place of residence. If everything runs smoothly during the second step, contact information is exchanged. This process altogether can be very stressful for the parents and the child because they are not always in agreement. This makes it even more difficult for a partner to be found. Li, a middle-aged man who has experienced blind dating says he has met women \\"who have no intention of finding a boyfriend. Meeting me is merely to indulge their parents\\". = South Korea = South Korean blind dating customs are preferred rather than other dating techniques. There are two kinds of blind dates in South Korea: \\"mee-ting\\" and \\"sogeting\\". Mee-ting blind dates are group dates with no prior expectations of commitment, and are often used by university students. A sogeting date usually includes less alcohol than a mee- ting date. It is also engaged in by people who are \\"single and looking\\".  Examples in popular culture  =Television= *Parental Control - An MTV reality show where parents pick two dates for their son or daughter. The parents ask the candidates a series of questions in order to pick the best two. After each of the dates the son or daughter chooses whether they would like to stay with their current significant other or if they would like to start a new relationship with one of the blind dates. *Blind Date Australia - An Australian dating game show produced by Sony Pictures Television. The show has the same format as the British and American versions of the show and was first aired in 1967 with Graham Webb hosting.

Each male participant would answer questions from the woman and at the end of the show, she would choose a candidate to go on a blind date with. This game even prompted its own board game line. *The Bachelor - An American television show which started in 2002 where a single man goes on blind dates with 25 women who wish to become his wife. The women live together in one household and are competing in an elimination game for a rose, an invitation from the bachelor to stay another week. This show has prompted other spin-off shows like The Bachelorette, Bachelor Pad and Bachelor in Paradise. *The Amazing Race 26 - In a departure from the regular format of the program, 10 single contestants were matched into 5 couples (4 heterosexual couples and a homosexual couple) based on compatibility tests in what was billed by producers as The most extreme blind date. These 5 couples were joined by 6 couples in a pre-existing relationship. = Film = *Blind Date - A 1934 American film starring Ann Sothern and Neil Hamilton *Blind Date - A 1987 American movie where Walter Davis (Bruce Willis) gets set up on a blind date with Nadia (Kim Basinger) by his brother so he can have a date to his office party. *Go-Con!

It is commonly referred to as the Turkish gecko as represented in its Latin name and also as the moon lizard because it emerges in the evening. A study in Portugal found H. turcicus to be totally nocturnal, with the highest activity peak around 2:00 AM.Mateus, O. & Jacinto, J.J.

They are insectivorous, rarely exceeding in length, have large, lidless eyes with elliptical pupils, and purple - or tan-colored skin with black spots, often with stripes on the tail. Their bellies or undersides are somewhat translucent. It is currently unknown what impact the geckos have on native wildlife in the regions they have been introduced to. In many parts of the world the range of H. turcicus is increasing, and unlike many other reptiles, they appear to be highly resistant to pesticides. The increase may be explained as a consequence of having few predators in places where they have been introduced, and also of their tendency to take shelter in the cracks and unseen areas of human homes, for example inside walls. Reliance on human habitation has thus contributed to their proliferation, similar to rodents. In some Eastern Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and Cyprus it is a taboo to harm them due to their benign nature and they are often kept as house pets.

Geographic distribution  Gecko being handled by a human Native to the Mediterranean region, the \\"Med gecko\\" is one of the most successful species of geckos in the world. It has spread over much of the world and established stable populations far from its origins; it holds no threatened or endangered status. It can be found in countries with Mediterranean climates, such as Portugal, Spain, France, Italy (including Lampedusa Island, Elba), Israel, Albania, Greece, Malta, North Macedonia, coastal Croatia (except western Istria), the Czech Republic (only the warm parts of Moravia and Czech Silesia), Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Adriatic islands, coastal Montenegro, the coastal part of Albania, Cyprus, Turkey, northern Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, Syria, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, northern Yemen (the Socotra Archipelago), Somalia, Eritrea, Kenya, southern Iran, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Pakistan, India, the Balearic Islands (Island Addaya Grande), the Canary Islands (introduced to Gran Canaria and Tenerife), Panama, Puerto Rico, Belize, and Cuba.

Behaviour A Mediterranean house gecko in ambush on a nest of a sphecid wasp Sceliphron spirifex. Mediterranean house geckoes emit a distinctive, high-pitched call somewhat like a squeak or the chirp of a bird, possibly expressing a territorial message. They are voracious predators on moths and small roaches, and are attracted to outdoor lights in search of these prey. They are also attracted by the call of a male decorated cricket (Gryllodes supplicans) even though the males are usually safely out of reach in a burrow, because female crickets attracted to the male's call can be intercepted and eaten.

History The group first came to the attention of record label Double T when they were finalist at Humo's Rock Rally, a prestigious Belgian rock contest, in 1996. Their first album was 1998's Little Things Of Venom (retitled At The Close Of Every Day for release in the United States). In 1999, after this album's success, they toured with Suede as well as opening for popular fellow Belgian band K's Choice. The following year they opened for Counting Crows on that band's European tour. 2001 brought extra fame for lead singer Steverlinck, who starred in the IMAX 3-D film Haunted Castle alongside Harry Shearer. The film also featured music by the band during the opening and closing credits. In 2002 the band released a second studio album, All Is Quiet Now, which was soon followed by a live album (Live in 2003). In 2008 their third studio album All Things Come in Waves was released. In 2009 Steverlinck was chosen by Arjen Lucassen as lead singer for a side project called Guilt Machine. 2010 saw the release of their fourth studio album Under the Cold Street Lights.

Her critically acclaimed and award- winning work spans a range of literary genres including poetry, short stories, autobiography, essays, and young-adult fiction. Ortiz Cofer was the Emeritus Regents' and Franklin Professor of English and Creative Writing at the University of Georgia, where she taught undergraduate and graduate creative writing workshops for 26 years. In 2010, Ortiz Cofer was inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame, and in 2013, she won the University's 2014 Southeastern Conference Faculty Achievement Award. Ortiz Cofer hailed from a family of story tellers and drew heavily from her personal experiences as a Puerto Rican American woman. In her work, Ortiz Cofer brings a poetic perspective to the intersection of memory and imagination. Writing in diverse genres, she investigated women issues, Latino culture, and the American South. Ortiz Cofer's work weaves together private life and public space through intimate portrayals of family relationships and rich descriptions of place. Her own papers are currently housed at the University of Georgia's Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Early years Judith Ort√≠z Cofer was born to Jesus Lugo Ort√≠z and Fanny Morot in Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, on February 24, 1952.Honoree - Georgia Writers Hall of Fame She moved to Paterson, New Jersey with her family in 1956. Morot gave birth to Judith Ort√≠z Cofer when she was fifteen years old.http://biography.jrank.org/pages/3697/Ortiz-Cofer- Judith-1952-Poet-Novelist-Educator-Childhood-Filled-With-Confusing-Moves.html They believed they would have more opportunities for young parents in America. Despite Lugo's passion for academia, he left school and joined the U.S. Navy. He was stationed in Panama when his daughter was born. He met Judith Ortiz Cofer for the first time two years later. It is evident that her family's move from Puerto Rico to New Jersey influenced her writing. Call Me Maria is a young adult novel that was published in 2004. It focuses on a teenage girl's transition from Puerto Rico to New York City. They often made back-and-forth trips between Paterson and Hormigueros. Ort√≠z Cofer reflects on these trips in her memoir, Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood, stating they were annoying to both her education and her social life. While she was primarily educated in Paterson, New Jersey, she attended local schools in Puerto Rico while she was there.https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/judith-ortiz- cofer-1952-2016 While in Puerto Rico, Ort√≠z Cofer would stay in the home of her grandmother. Her transition between Puerto Rico and New Jersey greatly influenced her writing because she was able to contrast the two cultures. In 1967, when Ort√≠z Cofer was fifteen, her family moved to Augusta, Georgia, where she lived until her death in 2016. There, she attended Butler High School. Judith and her brother, Ronaldo, initially resisted the family's move South. Upon arriving in Georgia, however, Ort√≠z Cofer was struck by Augusta's vibrant colors and vegetation compared with the gray concrete and skies of city-life in Paterson. Academic and literary career Ortiz Cofer received a B.A. in English from Augusta College, and later an M.A. in English literature from Florida Atlantic University. Early in her writing career, Ortiz Cofer won fellowships from Oxford University and the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, which enabled her to begin developing her multi-genre body of work. Cofer was fluent in English and Spanish and worked as a bilingual teacher in the public schools of Palm Beach County, Florida, during the 1974-1975 school year. After she received her master's degree and published her first collection of poems she became a lecturer in English at the University of Miami at Coral Gables. In 1984, Ortiz Cofer joined the faculty of the University of Georgia as the Franklin Professor of English and Creative Writing. After 26 years of teaching undergraduate and graduate students, Ortiz Cofer retired from the University of Georgia in December 2013. Ortiz Cofer is best known for creative nonfiction works but she has worked in poetry, short fiction, children's books, and personal narrative. Cofer began her writing career with poetry, which she believed contained \\"the essence of language.‚Äù One of her earliest books was Peregrina (1986) which won the Riverstone International Chapbook Competition. She has received various awards such as grants from the Witter Bynner Foundation and the Georgia Council for the Arts, as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts for poetry, the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, and the Florida Fine Arts Council. In 2010 Ortiz Cofer was admitted to the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame.  Death  In July 2014, Ortiz Cofer was diagnosed with a rare type of liver cancer shortly after her retirement. She died on December 30, 2016, at her home in Jefferson County, Georgia. A memorial service was held on January 27, 2017, followed by a reception at the Demosthenian Hall. She is buried in the Louisville City Cemetery, Georgia.

Her narrative self is strongly influenced by oral storytelling, which was inspired by her grandmother, an able storyteller in the tradition of teaching through storytelling among Puerto Rican women. Ortiz Cofer's autobiographical work often focuses on her attempts at negotiating her life between two cultures, American and Puerto Rican, and how this process informs her sensibilities as a writer. Her work also explores such subjects as racism and sexism in American culture, machismo and female empowerment in Puerto Rican culture, and the challenges diasporic immigrants face in a new culture. Among Ortiz Cofer's more well known essays are \\"The Story of My Body\\" and \\"The Myth of the Latin Woman,\\" both reprinted in The Latin Deli. A central theme Ortiz Cofer returns to again and again in her writing is language and the power of words to create and shape identities and worlds. Growing up, Ortiz Cofer's home language was Spanish. In school, she encountered English, which became her functional language and the language she wrote in. Early in her life, Ortiz Cofer realized her \\"main weapon in life was communication,\\" and to survive, she would have to become fluent in the language spoken where she lived. Ortiz Cofer believes that what it is important in life is not the event but the memory that these events produce. It was these memories that we as humans cling onto and our mind warp into how we would like to perceive these events. Ortiz Cofer tested her theory by asking both her mother and her brother to recall the same event. When both of them gave a different account of the same event, she came to the realization that a person's memory of an event is based on many other factors, such as gender, race and even emotional situation. This phenomenon became the basis of her writing. Ortiz Cofer had written many different things within her time, such as personal essays, poems, and even novels. In each of her works, she stresses the fact that this is her own rendition of the truth and that everyone remembers an event differently. In her own words, she says, ‚ÄúIf anyone objected I assured them that it wasn't my intent to defame them or warp the truth, but to give my rendition of it. My intent was poetic rather than genealogical.‚Äù  Major works  = The Latin Deli = The Latin Deli is a collection of poetry, personal essays, and short fiction. These stories have one central subject, the Latinos who live within the United States. While these Latinos, while coming from different backgrounds, are all interconnected by their roots being embedded within through collective roots in Europe, Africa, and the New World. One of the major aspects of the work is that \\"the qualities uniformness and uniqueness are not mutually exclusive, and that the memories of the past and hopes for the future can be intertwined on a daily basis.\\" Ortiz Cofer conveys this by using the lives of Puerto Ricans in a New Jersey barrio. This is directly parallel to her own upbringing in the United States. = Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood = Silent Dancing: A Partial Remembrance of a Puerto Rican Childhood is a collection of essays and poems that detail Ortiz Cofer's childhood. She goes from her village in Puerto Rico to her life within Paterson, New Jersey. She goes over what children of military parents must face, as she did with her father being in the U.S Navy. Like many Puerto Ricans, her father left the island in hope of having a better life. Furthermore, there is this them of spit loyalties, where Ortiz Cofer feels confused between her loyalty to the United States, the place where she grew up, and her loyalty to Puerto Rico, her own birthplace. This is a common issue with many Puerto Ricans. = An Island Like You: Stories of the Barrio = An Island Like You: Stories of the Barrio is a collection of twelve short stories following a cast of Puerto Rican teenage characters in a New Jersey barrio. The stories are written for a young adult audience. Like many of Ortiz Cofer's famous works, An Island Like You: Stories of the Barrio draws upon her upbringing as a Puerto Rican teenager in the United States. The collection was named one of the best books of the year young adults by the American Library Association in 1994 It also won the first ever Pura Belpr√© medal for narrative in 1996. The 12 stories take place in the same neighborhood, and often intertwine, though each has an independent plot. Some of the characters appear in more than one story, allowing the reader to see them from both their own perspective, and the perspective of another character. = The Line of the Sun = The Line of the Sun is a novel published in 1989 which tells the story of a Puerto Rican family from the late 1930s to the 1960s. A Spanish translation of the novel titled La L√≠nea del Sol was also published in 1996. The first half of the novel follows the family's lives in Puerto Rico, and centers on the character Uncle Guzm√°n. The second half of the novel is narrated by Marisol, the eldest daughter of the family. In this half, the family moves from Puerto Rico to a tenement in Paterson, New Jersey, and eventually to the New Jersey suburbs. This novel is based on Ortiz Cofer's own life, but includes fictional elements as well. The novel explores the theme of cultural identity, and gives a realistic illustration of the Puerto Rican migrant experience.

He moved to Copenhagen in 1883 and had his breakthrough the same year. In 1890 he obtained Danish citizenship. In 1910 he settled in Paris where he lived and worked until his death in 1922.Stephan Sinding (Store norske leksikon) Early life and education Sinding portrayed by Danish xylographer Hans Christian Olsen shortly after his move to Denmark Stephan Abel Sinding was born in Trondhjem as a son of mining engineer Matthias Wilhelm Sinding (1811‚Äì1860) and Cecilie Marie Mejdell (1817‚Äì1886). Sinding was the brother of the composer Christian Sinding and painter Otto Ludvig Sinding and the nephew of Nicolai Mejdell (1822‚Äì1899) and Thorvald Mejdell (1824‚Äì1908), and through the former a first cousin of Gl√∏r Thorvald Mejdell, who married Stephan's sister Thora Cathrine Sinding. Stephan Sinding was also a first cousin of Alfred Sinding-Larsen and the three siblings Ernst Anton Henrik Sinding, Elisabeth Sinding (1846‚Äì1930) and Gustav Adolf Sinding (1849‚Äì1925). Sinding first embarked on law studies in Christiania but broke off to instead pursue a career in the arts. He took drawing and modeling classes first at the Royal School of Drawing in Christiania and then studied privately with sculptor Albert Wolff in Berlin. Sinding spent his adult life working in different places mostly Rome, Copenhagen, and finally Paris. Julius Middelthun (Store norske leksikon) From 1874 to 1875 he studied in Paris and picked up influences from the latest Realist tendencies in French sculptures, especially from Auguste Rodin and Paul Dubois. Sinding was met with poor recognition from the Norwegian public since his style was considered too modern. Career in Denmark Sinding during work on the sculpture Electra for the new headquarters of the Great Northern Telegraph Company on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen, c. 1893 In 1883 he moved to Copenhagen, which he found a better working place, and had his breakthrough with the sculpture A barbarian woman carries her dead son home from the battle, created during a stay in Rome that same year. It was acquired by the brewer Carl Jacobsen, the son and heir of Carlsberg-founder Jacob Christian Jacobsen, who was a great admirer of both classical and modern sculpture and was building an ever-growing private collection which in the end turned into the Ny Carlsberg GlyptotekStephan Sinding/utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Sinding created a number of sculptures, among others Mother in Captivity, which won him the Grand Prix at the Exposition Universelle (1889), Two figures (1889), and Young woman at her husband's body / The Widow (1892). Many of Sinding's sculptures are credited to realism, but together with Danish sculptor Niels Hansen Jacobsen, among others, are by many considered much more in the style of Symbolism. An example of his symbolic work is his sculpture Valkyrjen (the valkyrie), a bronze cast of which stands in Churchill Park in Copenhagen. Sinding became a titular professor and taught private students in Copenhagen. Late years in Paris In 1910 Sinding moved to Paris, where he worked until his death. Assisted by Franz von Jessen, Sinding wrote an autobiography entitled En Billedhuggers Liv (1921). He died in January 1922 in Paris, and was buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Private life In May 1885 in Frederiksberg he married actress Anna Elga Augusta Betzonich (1859‚Äì1936).

Laid down in 1899 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel, she was launched on 12 June 1901 and commissioned on 25 October 1902. Her sisters were , , and ; they were the first capital ships built under the Navy Law of 1898, brought about by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. The ship, named for the former royal House of Z√§hringen, was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Z√§hringen saw active duty in I Squadron of the German fleet for the majority of her career. During this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training and making good-will visits to foreign countries. The training exercises conducted during this period provided the framework for the High Seas Fleet's operations during World War I. She was decommissioned in September 1910, but returned to service briefly for training in 1912, where she accidentally rammed and sank a torpedo boat. After the start of World War I in August 1914, Z√§hringen was brought back to active duty in IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea, including during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, but saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat of British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Z√§hringen. Instead, Z√§hringen was relegated to a target ship for torpedo training in 1917. In the mid-1920s, Z√§hringen was heavily reconstructed and equipped for use as a radio-controlled target ship. She served in this capacity until 1944, when she was sunk in Gotenhafen by British bombers during World War II. The retreating Germans raised the ship and moved her to the harbor mouth, where they scuttled her to block the port. Z√§hringen was broken up in situ in 1949‚Äì50.  Description  Line-drawing of the Wittelsbach class After the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office), Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Friedrich von Hollmann struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first Naval Law in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The Wittelsbachs were broadly similar to the Kaiser Friedrichs, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout. Z√§hringen was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six naval and six cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. Z√§hringens powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . The ship had a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men. Z√§hringens armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns in twin-gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns and twelve 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four were on the broadside. Z√§hringen was protected with Krupp armor. Her armored belt was thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces, and the deck was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.  Service history  =Construction to 1904= SMS Z√§hringen at high speed Z√§hringen was ordered under the contract name \\"E\\", as a new unit for the fleet. Her keel was laid down on 21 November 1899, at Friedrich Krupp's Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel. Z√§hringen was launched on 12 June 1901, with her launching speech given by Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden and head of the House of Z√§hringen; his wife, Grand Duchess Louise, christened the ship. Z√§hringen was commissioned on 25 October 1902, and began her sea trials, which lasted until 10 February 1903. She thereafter replaced the battleship in I Squadron of the Active Fleet. On 2 April 1903, the squadron went to sea and began gunnery training two days later. These exercises continued for the rest of the month, interrupted only by heavy storms. A major training cruise followed the next month; on 10 May the ships departed the Elbe river and made their way into the Atlantic. They cruised south to Spain, passing Ushant on 14 May and reaching the Iberian Peninsula five days later. There, they conducted a reconnaissance exercise off Pontevedra before anchoring in Vigo on 20 May. The squadron departed Spain on 30 May. The ships passed through the Strait of Dover on 3 June and continued into the Kattegat. There, they rendezvoused with the torpedo boats of I Torpedobootsflotille (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)‚Äîcommanded by Korvettenkapit√§n (Lieutenant Commander) Franz von Hipper‚Äîfor a mock attack on the fortifications at Kiel. Later in June, the ships took part in additional gunnery training and were present at the Kiel Week sailing regatta. During Kiel Week, an American squadron that included the battleship and four cruisers visited. Following the end of Kiel Week, I Squadron, which had been strengthened with the new cruiser , and I Torpedobootsflotille went to sea for more tactical and gunnery exercises in the North Sea, which lasted from 6 to 28 July. The annual fleet maneuvers began on 15 August; they consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The year's training schedule concluded with a cruise into the eastern Baltic that started on 23 November and a cruise into the Skagerrak that began on 1 December. Z√§hringen and the rest of I Squadron participated in an exercise in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March, and a major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May. In July, I Squadron and I Scouting Group visited Britain, including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina. I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in Molde, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports. The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with wireless telegraphy on a large scale and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major landing operation, after which the ships took the ground troops from IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing operations with IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. =1905‚Äì1914= 1912 painting of Z√§hringen on maneuvers by Fritz Stoltenberg Z√§hringen took part in a pair of training cruises with I Squadron during 9‚Äì19 January and 27 February ‚Äì 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinem√ºnde, and Flensburg, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; Z√§hringen and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinem√ºnde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the Anglo-German naval arms race. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In October, I Squadron went on a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises. The fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22‚Äì24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernf√∂rde Bay outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the High Seas Fleet. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. During the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern Schleswig with IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea, which included a stop in Horta in the Azores. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. In February 1909, Z√§hringen was employed as an icebreaker for the ports of the western Baltic. On 21 September 1910, Z√§hringen was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to the new dreadnought , which had recently been completed. Z√§hringen was then assigned to the Reserve Division of the North Sea, though the unit was dissolved on 12 May 1912, and its ships transferred to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea. Z√§hringen was recommissioned briefly, from 9 to 12 May, to transfer her to Kiel. She returned to service again later that year, from 14 August to 28 September, to take part in that year's fleet maneuvers as part of III Squadron. While exercising on 4 September, Z√§hringen accidentally rammed and sank the torpedo boat . Seven men from G171 were killed in the accident. Z√§hringen was again decommissioned after the conclusion of the exercises, and did not return to service until the start of World War I in August 1914. = World War I = Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 At the start of World War I, Z√§hringen was mobilized as part of IV Battle Squadron, along with her four sister ships and the battleships and . The squadron was divided into VII and VIII Divisions, with Z√§hringen assigned to the former. On 26 August, the ships were sent to rescue the stranded light cruiser , which had run aground off the island of Odensholm in the eastern Baltic, but by 28 August, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy Magdeburg before the relief force had arrived. As a result, Z√§hringen and the rest of the squadron cruised back toward Bornholm that day. Starting on 3 September, IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. Two days later the ships were transferred to the North Sea, though they stayed there only briefly, returning to the Baltic on 20 September. From 22 to 26 September, the squadron took part in a sweep into the eastern Baltic in an unsuccessful attempt to find and destroy Russian warships. From 4 December 1914 to 2 April 1915, the ships of IV Squadron were tasked with coastal defense duties along Germany's North Sea coast against incursions from the British Royal Navy. The German Army requested naval assistance for its campaign against Russia; Prince Heinrich, the commander of all naval forces in the Baltic, made VII Division, IV Scouting Group, and the torpedo boats of the Baltic fleet available for the operation. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on Libau. Z√§hringen and the other ships were stationed off Gotland to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings; the Russians did not do so. After cruisers from IV Scouting Group encountered Russian cruisers off Gotland, the ships of VII Division deployed‚Äîwith a third dummy funnel erected to disguise them as the more powerful s‚Äîalong with the cruiser . The ships advanced as far as the island of Ut√∂ on 9 May and to Kopparstenarna the following day, but by then the Russian cruisers had withdrawn. Later that day, the British submarines and spotted IV Squadron, but were too far away to attack them. From 27 May to 4 July, Z√§hringen was back in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the Jade, Ems, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the naval high command realized that the old Wittelsbach-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to Neufahrwassar, along with VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a demonstration, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces. The following month, the naval high command began an operation against the Gulf of Riga in support of the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive. The Baltic naval forces were reinforced with significant elements of the High Seas Fleet, including I Battle Squadron, I Scouting Group, II Scouting Group, and II Torpedo-boat Flotilla. Prince Heinrich planned that Schmidt's ships would force their way into the Gulf and destroy the Russian warships in Riga, while the heavy units of the High Seas Fleet would patrol to the north to prevent any of the main Russian Baltic Fleet that might try to interfere with the operation. The Germans launched their attack on 8 August, initiating the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. Minesweepers attempted to clear a path through the Irbe Strait, covered by Braunschweig and Elsass, while Z√§hringen and the rest of the squadron remained outside the strait. The Russian battleship attacked the Germans in the strait, forcing them to withdraw. During the action, the cruiser and the torpedo boat were damaged by mines and the torpedo boats and were mined and sunk. Schmidt withdrew his ships to re-coal and Prince Heinrich debated making another attempt, as by that time it had become clear that the German Army's advance toward Riga had stalled. Nevertheless, Prince Heinrich decided to try to force the channel a second time, but now two dreadnought battleships from I Squadron would cover the minesweepers. Z√§hringen was instead left behind in Libau. On 9 September, Z√§hringen and her four sisters sortied in an attempt to locate Russian warships off Gotland, but returned to port two days later without having engaged any opponents. Additionally, the threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships from active service. Z√§hringen and most of the other IV Squadron ships left Libau on 10 November, bound for Kiel; upon arrival the following day, they were designated the Reserve Division of the Baltic. The ships were anchored in Schilksee in Kiel. On 31 January 1916, the division was dissolved, and the ships were dispersed for subsidiary duties. Z√§hringen was initially used as a training ship in Kiel. In 1917, the ship was used to train stokers but then became a target ship for torpedo boats and the old ironclad , which had by that time become a torpedo training ship. Later, the Kaiserliche Marine considered replacing the cruiser , then the gunnery training ship, with Z√§hringen, and work began to refit her for this duty on 22 July 1918. The repairs and modifications had not been completed by the end of the war. The ship was left in Germany, and on 13 December was placed out of service. = Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine = The first Blitz, c. 1928, the control vessel for Z√§hringen According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles, Z√§hringen and her sisters were to be demilitarized. This would permit the newly reorganized Reichsmarine to retain the vessels for auxiliary purposes. Z√§hringen was therefore stricken from the navy list on 11 March 1920 and disarmed. She was then used as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven until 1926. That year, the Reichsmarine decided to rebuild Z√§hringen into a radio-controlled target ship, similar to vessels operated by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy. The conversion work lasted through 1928. The ship had its engine system overhauled; the three-shaft arrangement was replaced by a pair of 3-cylinder, vertical triple expansion engines. These were supplied with steam by two naval oil-fired, water-tube boilers. The system was designed to be operated remotely via wireless telegraph, with the receiver located deep inside the ship behind heavy armor protection so it would not be damaged by fire. The new propulsion system provided a top speed of . The superstructure was also cut down, removing all extraneous structures, and the hull was extensively modified. The watertight subdivisions were significantly increased, openings in the hull were sealed, and the ship was filled with some of cork. When the conversion was completed, Z√§hringen displaced . While not in use as a target, the ship was manned by a crew of 67. The torpedo boat was converted for use as Z√§hringens control vessel, and was renamed Blitz. She was later replaced by , which was also renamed Blitz. Z√§hringen participated in her first gunfire training session on 8 August 1928, in a ceremony held for President Paul von Hindenburg. During the exercise, the old battleship Elsass fired at Z√§hringen. Over the course of the next sixteen years, she served as a target vessel for the Reichsmarine and then the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany, together with the old battleship . This period revealed that the addition of cork, meant to help keep the ship afloat in the event of a major hull breach, was a poor choice, as it caught fire easily. The modification of the ship's propulsion system also proved to be a mistake, as the ship's speed was too low, and it hindered her maneuverability. These experiences affected the conversion of Hessen, and neither mistake was repeated when that vessel was converted in the mid-1930s. Z√§hringen continued on in service through World War II, initially based in Wilhelmshaven. Z√§hringen, Hessen, and their radio control boats were assigned to the Inspectorate of Naval Artillery on 1 August 1942. On 18 December 1944, the old ship was hit by bombs during an air raid on Gotenhafen and sank in shallow water. She was temporarily refloated and towed to the harbor entrance, where she was scuttled to block the port on 26 March 1945. The wreck was broken up in situ starting in 1949; work lasted until 1950.

The species is endemic to Asia. Etymology The specific name, kuhli, is in honor of German zoologist Heinrich Kuhl.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael. (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Ptychozoon kuhli, p. 147). Description Dorsal view of Kuhl's flying gecko in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia G. kuhli has adaptations to its skin, including flaps on either side of its body, webbed feet, and a flattened tail to allow it to glide over short distances. This gecko has a remarkable camouflage. The flaps of skin along its sides help it blend with tree bark. Often, its eyes are the only way to distinguish it from its surroundings. This use of camouflage by G. kuhli has caused need for some other adaptions to protect it from the increased UV exposure. Despite being nocturnal, they are considered heliothermic because of the extended sun exposure they receive while resting during the day. This increased UV exposure has led to the adaption of pigmented internal organs to protect the lizards more important organs from UV damage.Griffing, A. H., Gamble, T., & Bauer, A. M. (2020).

Development of the 23 class beagn in August 1915 when Vickers was asked to improve the 9r design by increasing its gas capacity by adding a bay and increasing the capacity of the bow and stern gas cells.Higham 1961, pp. 133‚Äì134 The 23-class was designed by H.B. Pratt and Barnes Wallis of Vickers.Mowthorp 1995, pp. 125 Vickers built the first and last of the four ships. The other two were built by William Beardmore and Company and Armstrong-Whitworth. While the 23 class airships were never used in combat, the four ships provided many hours of valuable training and experimental data for British airship crews and designers. Although a total of 17 of these ships were contemplated at one time, only four were ever built.Higham 1961, pp. 135 The 23 class was found to be significantly overweight, leading to its cancellation in favour of the more-refined R23X class. Design and development Following proposals in July 1915 to order more airships to the same design as the 9r then being built by Vickers, on 28 August Vickers were asked to design a new class of airship based on the 9r. To facilitate rapid mass-production, the same transverse frame design as the 9r were used, but lift was increased by adding an extra bay and by making the nose and tail fuller to accommodate larger gasbags.Higham 1961, pp. 131‚Äì3 The great portion of the 23 class structure was identical to the 9r's.Higham 1961, pp. 134Power was provided by four Rolls-Royce Eagle engines. The triangular section exterior keel had a widened section amidships incorporating a bomb bay, sleeping quarters, radio room and toilet.Mowthorp 1995, pp. 127 Three gondolas were suspended from the keel. The forward gondola contained the control room and one engine driving a pair of swivelling propellors, a second amidships contained two engines each driving a fixed four-bladed pusher propeller on outriggers, and the aft gondola contained the fourth engine driving a single two-bladed pusher propeller and an emergency control car. Ballast and fuel were carried in tanks along the keel. Rudders and elevators were of the cruciform type. The design drawings were approved on 10 October 1915.Higham 1961 pp. 134-5 Construction Initially three examples were ordered. One was to be built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. A second, 24r, was ordered from William Beardmore and Company at Inchinnan, in Renfrewshire, Scotland. The third, 25r, was ordered from Armstrong-Whitworth at Barlow, North Yorkshire. Many of the components for the ships were built by Beardmore and Armstrong. In December the Treasury approved construction of sixteen more airships, also agreeing on Government loans for the construction of additional construction sheds. One more ship was ordered from Vickers and two from Beardmore and Armstrong. However at this point the Treasury intervened, refusing to allow construction of any more airships until there were sufficient sheds in which to house them.Higham 1961, pp. 135 Operational history =23r= N6814 Construction was begun by Vickers on 1 January 1916. Construction was delayed by material shortages (including the shortage of linen caused by the Easter rising in Ireland) and strikes. The trial flight took place at Barrow on 19 September 1917.Higham 1961, pp. 135 The ship was found to have less than the rated lift so the dynamos, bomb gear and furniture were removed to save weight.Higham 1961, pp. 352 A Maybach engine from the crashed Zeppelin L 33 replaced the Rolls-Royce in a new rear car, this one without emergency controls. 23r flew to RNAS Howden, Yorkshire, on 15 October 1917, and then to RNAS Pulham, Norfolk, on 29 October. It flew over central London on 6 December, bringing the city to a standstill and generating a wave of patriotic fervour. Despite the airship's identification markings being clearly visible to millions of Londoners, the censors banned publication of the name of the ship. A record flight of 40 hours 8 minutes was made in May 1918, as well as experiments with defensive armament of a 2-pounder QF gun and three machine guns. The shells from the large gun caused the ground crew at Pullham some alarm when they ricochetted off the ground instead of exploding harmlessly. In July, experiments were made with parasite fighters, in the hope that they could defend the airship.Fitzsimons, p. 521. First an unmanned, then a manned, Sopwith Camel were launched successfully.Mowthorp 1995, pp. 127 In November, the experiment was successfully completed with two other manned Camels. No. 23r overflew the surrender of the German submarine fleet at Harwich in November 1918, before being modified for experiments with the three-wire mooring system in March 1919. It was deleted in September 1919 after a total of about 320 hours.Mowthorp 1995, pp. 129 Painting of two 23-class airships at Pulham by John Lavery. Note the tank in the foreground used for ground-handling. =24r= When the decision was taken to lighten the overweight 23r and 25r in October 1917, 24r was tested as well. The problem was found to be even worse, with 24r weighing around 1,500 lb (680 kg) more than its sisters ‚Äì a difference that was eventually traced to the use of slightly larger and heavier fasteners throughout her structure.Mowthorp 1995, pp. 129 A solution was required with some urgency, since Beardmore's construction shed needed to be cleared so that work could begin on R34, but the problem was exacerbated by 24r needing all the lift possible to safely navigate the hilly Scottish countryside. Eventually, the decision was taken to completely strip its aft power car, removing the engine and all associated machinery. While this gave 24r more than enough lift, it limited its top speed to 35 mph (56 km/h).Mowthorp 1995, pp. 129 It was intended that the rear power car would be eventually replaced with one of lighter design, but this was never carried out, and 24r operated throughout the war with only three engines. On one occasion, this led to a situation over Bass Rock where the airship was held immobilised by a headwind, prevented from making any headway at all. It was eventually retired in December 1919 with a total flight time of 164 hours and 40 minutes over a distance of 4,200 mi (6,720 km). =25r= 25r was built by Armstrong-Whitworth and completed five weeks after 23r, in October 1917. When found to have the same weight problems during trim trials carried out in a hangar at Armstrong-Whitworth's airship works at Barlow, North Yorkshire, it was similarly lightened, carrying out its first test flight on 14 October 1917.Tapper 1988, p. 94. In later flights, another problem emerged: surging of the gasbags caused sudden and unpredictable movement of the ship's centre of pressure, thereby causing instability. Despite this problem, the airship (by now known as R 25) was officially accepted into service on 23 December 1917, and continued in service until September 1919, by which time it had flown 221 hours and 5 minutes and covered 5,909 mi (9,454 km). =R.26= R.26 was the first airship designated under the new system of adding an \\"R\\" prefix rather than an \\"r\\" suffix for rigids. It had the benefit of being only in the early stages of construction when the weight problems with its sisters were discovered, allowing weight-saving measures to be implemented from the outset. On 4‚Äì5 June 1918, it set a new endurance record for the 23 class by carrying out a patrol of 40 hours 40 minutes. With 23r, it oversaw the surrender of the German U-boats at Harwich, before being assigned to experiments in early 1919 to investigate the practicalities of mooring airships in the open. While promising at first, its envelope was eventually soaked with rain, and the airship was subsequently beaten into the ground by a snowstorm. Although refloated by removing its power cars, the structural damage was found to be too great to warrant repairs, and it was struck off charge on 10 March.Mowthorp 1995, pp. 130 Operators ; *Royal Navy Specifications See also Notes References * Airships Heritage Trust, 2006, Airshipsonline : Airships : HMA 23 Class * Higham, Robin.

Description E. johnii Adults of E. johnii rarely exceed in total length (including tail), although they sometimes reach 3 feet (91 cm). Adapted to burrowing, the head is wedge-shaped with narrow nostrils and very small eyes. The body is cylindrical in shape with small polished dorsal scales. The tail, which is blunt, rounded, and not distinct from the body, appears truncated. Coloration varies from reddish brown to dull yellow-tan. Geographic range Eryx johnii is found from Iran through Pakistan into western, southern, and northwestern India. The type locality given is \\"Tranquebar\\" (Tanjore, Trichy, southeastern Tamil Nadu, India). and found in Indian desert. In western India, specifically state of Maharashtra, it is known as a Mandul snake (Marathi: ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§°‡•Ç‡§≥ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§™). Habitat Eryx johnii is found in dry, semi-desert scrub plains and rocky dry foothills. It prefers loose sand, or sandy soil that crumbles easily, into which it burrows, living underground. Diet The diet of E. johnii consists mainly of mammals such as rats, mice, and other small rodents that are killed by constriction. Some specimens have apparently fed exclusively on other snakes. Reproduction Eryx johnii is ovoviviparous, with females giving birth to up to 14 young at a time. Illegal trade Eryx johnii has many superstitious beliefs attributed to it because of its double- headed appearance, such as bringing good luck, curing AIDS, etc. Such blind faith has resulted in endangering the species, and in illegal trade in India, despite being a protected species under Schedule IV of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, of India.http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-22/coimbatore/35301434_1_red- sand-boas-snake-coimbatore-zoo References Further reading *Boulenger GA (1890).

He was, in partnership with the Methodist Church, responsible for laying down the foundings of the college including the Sugden Principle. Early life Sugden was born in Ecclesfield, near Sheffield, Yorkshire, England. He was the eldest son of Rev. James Sugden, a minister of the Wesleyan Methodist Church and his wife Sarah, n√©e Holdsworth. Sugden was educated at the boarding school Woodhouse Grove School, and in 1870 passed the London matriculation examination, gaining first place on the list, which entitled him to the Gilchrist scholarship of fifty pounds a year for three years at Owens College, Manchester. There he studied, among other things, Greek testament textual criticism, Hebrew, and English poetry. Sugden was always grateful to his school for having taught him to sing by note, and at Manchester he studied harmony and counterpoint under (Sir) John Frederick Bridge, afterwards known as \\"Westminster Bridge\\", then organist at Manchester Cathedral. Sugden took his degree with honours in classics at University of London in 1873, and a year later was accepted for the Methodist ministry and appointed assistant tutor at Headingley theological college, Leeds. While in this position he took the degree of BSc (1876) He was seven years at Headingley college, was then appointed a junior circuit minister, and spent six successful years at this work. Sugden continued his interest in music and became a member of the Leeds Festival Chorus, and he also did some experimental work in psychical research and particularly in thought reading. Sugden married Mary Florence, n√©e Brooke, at Stockport, Cheshire, England, on 22 August 1878; Mary died in childbirth in 1883.On 27 October 1886 Sugden married Ruth Hannah Thompson (d. 1932) at Bradford, Yorkshire, England; Sugden later described her as\\"my incomparable helpmate in every part of my work\\". In 1887 Sugden was appointed the first master of Queen's College, Melbourne, and began his duties early in 1888. Queen's College In 1878 the Methodist Church decided to found the Queen's College, but nearly 10 years elapsed before funding allowed building to begin. The foundation-stone was laid on 19 June 1887, and on 14 March 1888 the college was formally opened. There were only 12 students in the first year; for many years there was a heavy debt on the building and an annual loss on the working of the college. Gifts and bequests came in over time however, and although four additions were made to the building during Sugden's term as master, he left it free of debt. Sugden's methods were based on those of his close friend and mentor, Benjamin Hellier‚Äîto find something in every person he could respect to use as a basis to build upon. The overall development of the students was encouraged by reading circles and the performance of plays in the college. Musicians were welcomed in Sugden's home circle where Sugden himself would play the cello in a quartette. Sugden gathered distinguished scholars and involved them in the life of Queen's College. Among the first honorary fellows were three world- renowned anthropologists, Lorimer Fison, William Howitt, and Sir Baldwin Spencer. Among the newly appointed professors to the University from overseas who Sugden welcomed as resident members were William Ralph Boyce Gibson, Harold Woodruff, Sir Robert Wallace and Sir Samuel Wadham. In 1890 the dining- hall and several students' rooms were added to the college building, and 20 years later the eastern fa√ßade was completed. In 1919 Queen's College main tower, which houses the library, and a new front wing (including the chapel) were built. In 1927 Sugden was invited to deliver the annual Fernley lecture in England, and early in 1928 he was given leave of absence with the understanding that he would retire at the end of the year. His stay in England was made pleasant by the gift of a motor-car from a Melbourne friend which met him when he landed. He returned in November, left Queen's just before Christmas, and spent his retirement at Hawthorn, a suburb of Melbourne. At Queen's College it had been the custom of the students to meet outside the master's residence on the evening of his birthday, and serenade him. Though new generations of students came who had not known Sugden, this custom was continued at his new home. Other achievements Sugden, a Liberal Imperialist, offered his services on the outbreak of World War I and was appointed chaplain with the rank of captain and throughout the war. He spent half each working day ministering to the troops in training at Royal Park. Sugden also took interest in Methodist affairs, frequently preached, in 1906 was elected president of the Victoria and Tasmania conference. In 1923 Sugden was president-general of the Methodist Church of Australia. He was elected to the council of the University in 1899, and was a valuable member of it until its re-constitution in 1925. Sugden was also a member of the committee of the University Conservatorium of Music and later its chairman, played the cello in amateur orchestras. As choir master of the Palmerston Street Church, Sugden discovered the singer, Florence Austral, then Florence Fawaz. From 1904 to 1912 he was musical critic for The Argus and The Australasian. Sugden was president of the Melbourne Shakespeare Society in 1914‚Äì1915. Sugden was a trustee of the Public Library, museums, and National Gallery of Victoria in 1902, was elected vice-president in 1928, and president in 1933‚Äì35. Sugden had little knowledge of art, but took much interest in the books committee work. Sugden was first chairman of Melbourne University Press, 1922‚Äì25. Sugden did a considerable amount of writing during his life. Before leaving England he had done voluntary work for volume I of the Oxford English Dictionary. In 1893 appeared Comedies of T. Maccius Plautus, translated in the original metres. This was followed by Miles Gloriosus, by T. Maccius Plautus, translated in the original metres (1912), The Psalms of David, translated into English verse (1924), A Topographical Dictionary to the Works of Shakespeare and his Fellow Dramatists (1925), Israel's Debt to Egypt, Fernley lecture (1928), John Wesley's London (1932). He wrote \\"Part I. The Private Life\\" in George Swinburne, A Biography (1931), contributed a chapter on the \\"Settlement of Tasmania and Victoria\\" in A Century in the Pacific (1914), and one \\"In Australasia\\" for A New History of Methodism, 1909. Sugden also prepared Festal Songs for Sunday School Anniversaries in five series, and in 1921 edited with notes Wesley's Standard Sermons in two volumes. There were several other studies and addresses published as pamphlets. Late life and legacy Sugden preached his last sermon in 1933, but until a few weeks before the end, was able to attend most meetings of the trustees of the public library. When in 1934 the trustees were entertaining Masefield, the poet assisted his host to his feet, and Sugden with characteristic wit remarked, \\"Well, that is not the first uplift I have received from John Masefield.\\" Sugden was confined to his room when the Queen's College students serenaded him for the last time on his eighty-first birthday, and he died about a month later on 22 July 1935 at his home in Hawthorn. Sugden received the degree of Litt. D. from the University of Melbourne by thesis in 1918. There is a memorial window to Dr. and Mrs. Sugden in Queen's College chapel, and a portrait of Sugden by Charles Wheeler is in the National Gallery of Victoria. He was survived by three daughters of each marriage. Sugden was a large man who had a charming smile. Sugden showed great courage in writing to the press taking the side of Marshall Hall who had offended the churches with one of his publications.

The Crichel Down Rules are guidelines applying to compulsory purchase drawn up in the light of the affair. Crichel Down land The case centred on of agricultural land at Crichel Down, near Long Crichel, Dorset. Much of the land in question was part of the estate of Crichel House, owned by the 3rd Baron Alington. The land was purchased compulsorily in 1938 by the Air Ministry for use for bombing practice by the Royal Air Force. The purchase price when it was requisitioned was ¬£12,006. In 1940, the owner died on active service in the RAF, and the Crichel estate passed in trust to his only child, Mary Anna Sturt (then aged 11), who married Commander Marten in 1949. In 1941, Winston Churchill gave a promise in Parliament that the land would be returned to its owners, after the Second World War, when it was no longer required for the purpose for which it had been bought. This promise was not honoured. Instead the land (then valued at ¬£21,000) was handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture who vastly increased the price of the land beyond the amount the original owners could afford (¬£32,000), and leased it out. Aftermath In 1949, Toby and Mary Anna Marten (daughter of the third Lord Alington), now the owners of the Crichel estate, began a campaign for the government's promise to be kept, by a return sale of the land. They gained a public inquiry. This inquiry was conducted by Sir Andrew Clark QC whose report was damning about actions in the case taken by those acting for the government. Archive material later released caused some shift in interpretation. \\\\- J.A.G. Griffith, \\"The Crichel down Affair\\" (1955) Modern Law Review 18 557. \\\\- J.A.G.

The minister responsible, Sir Thomas Dugdale, resigned and the Crichel estate part of the land was sold back to the owners (the Martens). The resignation of Dugdale has been taken as setting a precedent on ministerial responsibility, even though the doctrine supposed to arise from the affair is only partially supported by the details. Lord Carrington, Dugdale's junior minister, offered his resignation but was told to stay on. Crichel had another fight against \\"authority\\" on its hands in the 1990s when Commander Marten objected to plans to redevelop a former paper mill the estate had sold to the local council in the mid-1950s. A fictionalised version of the affair was used in an episode of Foyle's War broadcast on ITV on 7 April 2013, which examined the conflict between \\"the greater good of the State\\" and natural justice as it affects government and the security services. The Crichel Down affair is also mentioned in The Late Scholar, a detective novel by Jill Paton Walsh. Analysis From page 3 of the monograph, Whose land was it anyway?

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . rough-tailed sand boa. Gongylophis conicus, also known as Russell's boa or the rough-scaled sand boa, is a species of nonvenomous snake in the subfamily Erycinae of the family Boidae. The species is endemic to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. There are no subspecies which are recognised as being valid. Description G. conicus Adults of G. conicus may attain a total length of , which includes a tail long. The anterior maxillary and mandibular teeth are longer than the posterior. The head is covered with small scales. The eye is small with a vertical pupil. The dorsal scales are small and keeled. The tail is pointed, not or but very slightly prehensile.Boulenger GA (1893). Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History). Volume I., Containing the Families ... Boid√¶ ... London: Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History). (Taylor and Francis, printers). xiii + 448 pp. + Plates-XXVIII. (Eryx conicus, pp. 122-124). The rostral scale is twice as broad as long, slightly prominent, without an angular horizontal edge. The top of the head is covered with small obtusely keeled scales, except for the nasals and internasals which are enlarged. Interorbitals: 8 to 10. Circumorbitals: 10 to 15. The eye is separated from the labials by one or two rows of scales. Supralabial scales: 12 to 14. Dorsal scales tubercularly keeled, in 40 to 49 rows. Ventral scales: 162-186. The anal scale is single. Subcaudals: 17-24. The anterior dorsal scales are only feebly keeled, but these keels increase in size posteriorly to the point that they become so heavily keeled that it can make a squirming specimen really painful to handle. This also makes it look as if the front and rear ends belong to markedly different animals.Ditmars RL (1933). Reptiles of the World. Revised Edition. New York: The MacMillan Company. 329 pp. 89 plates. Dorsally, the color pattern consists of a broad zigzag band or a series of dark brown blotches on a yellowish or brownish grey ground color. The belly is uniform white. In India it can be mistaken at first glance for either the Indian python, Python m. molurus, or the deadly Russell's viper, Daboia russelii. Behavior Gongylophis conicus is active at night. Diet Gongylophis conicus feeds on worms and small mammals. Geographic range Gongylophis conicus is found in India south of about 30¬∞N latitude, Nepal, Bangladesh and in the northern arid region of Sri Lanka. The type locality given is \\"India orientali \\". Habitat The preferred habitats of G. conicus are sandy tracts of central and southern India, the Punjab, Kachchh and Sind. It is also found in Meghalaya. Mimicry The rough-scaled sand boa's color pattern frequently resembles that of the highly venomous Russell's viper, which some herpetologists believe is a case of Batesian mimicry. Reproduction Gongylophis conicus is viviparous. References Further reading *Boulenger GA (1890). The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma. Reptilia and Batrachia.

Granton forms part of Edinburgh's waterfront along the Firth of Forth and is, historically, an industrial area having a large harbour. Granton is part of Edinburgh's large scale waterfront regeneration programme. Name Granton first appears on maps in the seventeenth century relating to the now-demolished Granton Castle. The name also appears in Granton Burn, which now runs through Caroline Park down to what was Granton Beach. The name is presumed to come from Grant's Town or Grant's Dun (hill). Granton Castle The castle is first documented in 1479, as a building owned by John Melville of Carnbee, Fife. It stood to the north-west of the current mansion, Caroline Park. On John's death it passed to his son, also John Melville, who was one of the many Scottish nobility killed at the Battle of Flodden. In 1592 it was sold by the Melville family to John Russell but by 1619 was acquired by Sir Thomas Hope, the Lord Advocate, who greatly altered and extended the castle. On his death it passed to his son, Sir John Hope, Lord Craighall.Stranger on the Shore, James Gracie, p.21 The building fell derelict by the 18th century. At the end of the 19th century the architectural historians MacGibbon and Ross did a survey and created scale drawings of the remnants. This showed a standard L-plan Scottish tower house with a courtyard to the north side. This was accessed by a gateway on the west side, on the outer side of which was a loupin stane, a set of steps to aid a person to mount a horse. In 1928 a quarrying firm, Bain and Brown, bought the site to excavate the rock outcrop beneath the castle. The majority of the castle was lost due to this exercise. The exercise itself was largely redundant as the steeply angled rock bed quickly meant excavation became too deep to be economic. Now only small fragments of the castle remain. Granton Harbour Granton Harbour in its heyday, around the 1860s Houses in Lower Granton Road Former HMS Claverhouse, Granton Square In 1834 Edinburgh debated the need for a larger harbour. James Walker in his capacity as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers oversaw a committee, also including Admiral David Milne, to choose between three options: an extension to the existing Leith Docks; a new harbour at Trinity or a new harbour at Granton. The initial bid for Trinity did not receive parliamentary consent and in 1836 a second Bill promoting Granton was agreed. It received Royal Assent on 21 April 1837.Stranger on the Shore, by James Gracies Construction began in June 1837 and the initial central pier was opened on 28 June 1838, coinciding with the coronation of Queen Victoria. The entire project was funded by the 5th Duke of Buccleuch. The original project included a central pier named the Victoria Jetty and a road running eastwards to Leith. The young Queen Victoria landed at the pier on RY Royal George on 1 September 1842 on her first official visit to Edinburgh as queen. In 1843/44 the pier was extended in length to a total of 1700 feet (around 500m) this stage being completed in October 1844. By 1845 an \\"exceedingly low\\" cost steamboat service used to run between Stirling and Granton. Lighthouse engineer Robert Stevenson oversaw the later construction of the outer breakwaters, which were completed in 1863. Thereafter the Resident Engineer was John Howkins, followed by his son, also John Howkins. The original concept to create two large wet docks on the landward side was abandoned as this proved impractical.Stranger on the Shore, James Gracie, p.14/15 (map) Granton became a successful port for the export of coal, and import of esparto grass for making paper. The fishing fleet grew considerably, leading to the development of an ice house in the late 19th century, to the west of the harbour. There were some 80 fishing trawlers resident just before World War II. The first example of the fossil crustacean Waterstonella was found in the Granton shrimp beds by the keeper of geology at the Royal Scottish Museum, Dr. Charles Waterstone. The foreshore area between Granton and Newhaven is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) aimed at encouraging and preserving the resource of fossils in the area. From 3 February 1850, the world's first ferry-train began operating between Granton and Burntisland, Fife. The paddle-steamer Leviathan carried the trains, which formed the main link across the Forth until completion of the Forth Bridge in 1890. Passenger and car ferry services continued into the 1960s. In 1884, John Murray set up the Marine Laboratory in Granton, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. In 1894, this laboratory was moved to Millport, Isle of Cumbrae, on the Firth of Clyde, and became the University Marine Biological Station, Millport, the forerunner of today's Scottish Association for Marine Science at Dunstaffnage, near Oban, Argyll and Bute. During the First World War Granton harbour was used as the base for mine-sweeping equipment: mainly Scottish trawlers and their crews, called into active service and conscripted as part of the Royal Navy Reserve. During this period the harbour was officially renamed as \\"HMS Gunner\\" when referred to in military documents, in reference to the name of the largest trawler in its fleet. The harbour was then home to mine-sweepers, decoy ships (Q-ships), and anti-submarine vessels. The north section held smaller support vessels specifically built for Navy use, including 24 motor launches, 18 paddle mine-sweepers, and 30 boom-defence vessels, with a total of 103 craft.The War at Sea: WW100 Scotland Granton was the key base in Scotland of the Northern Lighthouse Board with their boats taking lighthouse keepers and their supplies to and from lighthouses around the coast of Scotland. Granton also became the base for pilots from 1920, guiding ships into the Firth of Forth, a service it still provides a base for today. From 1942 to 1946, Granton harbour was home of shore-based minesweeping training establishment HMS Lochinvar. As the scale of the harbour restricted ship size, it became a site for scrapping former Royal Navy ships, including HMS Newport and HMS Hedingham Castle. Today two boat clubs jointly run the Edinburgh Marina: the Forth Corinthian Yacht Club and the Royal Forth Yacht Club. Industry Preserved gasholder of the Granton Gasworks Granton quarry to the west of the harbour was initially developed to provide stone to build the harbour. Later it provided stone for parts of Holyrood Palace, and for the statue of Lord Nelson on Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, London. The oldest surviving car factory building in Britain is located in Granton. The Madelvic Motor Carriage Company works were built in 1898 for the manufacture of electric cars. Like the gasometers, the factory is also a listed building. However, approval has been granted for its demolition as part of wider redevelopment of the area.Historic Madelvic car factory set to be demolished after Edinburgh Council U-turn ‚Äì Edinburgh Evening News 12 January 2010 Granton Gasworks were formerly one of Edinburgh waterfront's most prominent landmarks, comprising three blue gasometers which were clearly visible from Fife. Two of the structures, built in the 1930s and 1970s, have now been demolished. The third structure remains, and is listed as an example of Victorian industrial architecture. Development during World War Two included the construction of the works of Bruce Peebles (later Parsons Peebles), that made high voltage electrical equipment, including transformers for electricity power stations. The works burnt down in a huge fire in 1999, and is now part of the waterside redevelopment. The firm continues in business as Parsons Peebles Generation Limited, Wood Road, Royal Dockyard, Rosyth. Ferranti's factory on Ferry Road was built to make electronics for aircraft, including gyro-based gunsights for the Supermarine Spitfire.

He became an investor in the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway, which in 1842 opened a line from Canal Street railway station, at right angles to the present Waverley station, Edinburgh, to Trinity Crescent near the Trinity Chain Pier. The line was extended in 1838 to Granton harbour, located on the middle pier. The junction in Edinburgh was too steep to be operated by locomotive, and so trains had to be worked by rope. By 1868, a new line was built from Waverley station through Abbeyhill to Bonnington which ended rope working. The remains of the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway embankment at Granton in 2009 From 1846-1890, Burntisland railway station was part of the main East Coast railway line to Perth, Dundee and Aberdeen. In 1890 when the Forth Bridge opened, the long distance trains started using it and after that the line to Granton was just used by local passenger and goods trains. Passenger trains ran until 1926, when the tram and omnibus services became fully integrated. Goods services ran until 1986, when the lines were lifted. In 1861, the Caledonian Railway opened a line to Granton from Dalry, providing a goods service to Granton harbour. They agreed a contract to run passenger services to the new gas works from central Edinburgh. In 1864, the Caledonian built a line to Leith, with stations at Newhaven Road (near Trinity Academy), Granton Road, East Pilton, Craigleith, Murrayfield and Dalry Road running to Edinburgh Princes Street. One of the two connections between the Caledonian and the North British networks was on Granton Square. Passenger trains ran until 1962, and goods trains until 1968, when the lines were removed. The railway embankment, which separated Lower Granton Road from the Forth, was removed in the late-1980s. =Trams= In 1909, Leith Corporation ran trams from Leith to Granton. They were joined in 1923 by trams from the Edinburgh Corporation, resulting at one point, having seven tram routes to the area: four from Leith via Lower Granton Road (services 2, 14, 16 and 17); three via Granton Road (services 8, 9 and 13). Trams to Granton were withdrawn in stages, from 1952 to 1956, and replaced by buses. Proposed to be part of the new Edinburgh Trams systems on Line 1b, in April 2009, the City of Edinburgh Council announced the cancellation of Phase 1b of the project citing problems caused by the global recession, saving an estimated ¬£75,000,000. The decision meant that the construction of the line to Granton will not go ahead for the foreseeable future, although the possibility remains open that this phase may be revived in future, subject to available funds. Inter War to Present Edinburgh College (Granton Campus), West Granton From 1932, the Council developed Granton as a major housing scheme. Over 1,500 houses, mainly tenements, were built from east to west, designed by City Architect Ebenezer MacRae and his team. The majority of these properties are still in use. Dr. Charles Munro had developed a general practice in the area, and when he was called up for national service in World War Two, his locum was pioneering German Dr. Ekkehard von Kuenssberg. Post-war Kuenssberg developed \\"The Care Trust\\" that integrated all local government services into one group, becoming one of the first cases of primary care in what was the newly launched National Health Service. Much of West Granton housing was demolished from 1995 onwards. The Edinburgh Waterfront scheme is bringing about the redevelopment of Leith and Granton. The gasworks site spread over , is to be redeveloped as the ForthQuarter, a mixed-use development of housing, offices, local services, a park, and a new campus for Edinburgh College. The area was masterplanned by Foster and Partners, although the individual \\"plots\\" will be separately designed by other architects. As part of the redevelopment, the main storage building of the National Museums of Scotland opened in Granton in 1996. It does not serve a publicly accessible museum function. A new reception and conservation building was built at its entrance in 2005. It has been proposed that the decommissioned Type 42 destroyer HMS Edinburgh could be preserved in Granton Harbour.

Plot On television show Frightmare Theatre, the Horror Host welcomes viewers and introduces them to the film they are about to see, The Roost. Four friends - Trevor, Allison, Brian, and Elliot - are traveling to go to a wedding. They are frightened by a bat flying into the windshield and crash the car in a ditch, and are unable to get it started again. With no other ideas, the four go to look for a nearby house to call for help, not realizing the older couple within the nearest house have been killed by an unseen force. While looking for help, the friends are attacked by a swarm of bats. A police officer who comes to investigate the house is attacked by bats as well, causing him to fall off a ledge to his death. However, the bats' attack causes the dead police officer to reanimate and attack the friends, who are forced to imprison him and then kill him. One by one, each of the friends is attacked by the reanimated corpses of those killed by bats, leaving only Allison and Elliot alive. They realize their situation is hopeless and accept their fate. However, back on the TV program, the Horror Host expresses displeasure at this ending, and rewinds the film to see the film's \\"alternate\\", more exciting ending, in which Allison is killed by the bats and Elliot flees the house in the police officer's car. He stops at a bridge, asking a tow truck driver for help. The driver is attacked and killed by another swarm of bats, and Elliot is attacked by a reanimated Allison. The Horror Host warns viewers that the show is over and his master is home, telling them to leave. The \\"viewer\\" holding the camera is attacked by a demonic dog, ending the film.

Eflatun Pƒ±nar 1887 Eflatun Pƒ±nar (, ) is the name given to a spring, which rises up from the ground, and the stone-built pool monument built at the time of the Hittite Empire. The spring lies inside the Lake Bey≈üehir National Park, west of Konya, and drains into Lake Bey≈üehir in central Anatolia at ancient Pisidia region. During the Late Bronze Age, a sacred pool monument was built here in trachyte ashlar masonry dedicated to the sacred spring cult of ancient Hittites. The monument was interpreted as a shrine to Plato during the medieval (Seljuk) period. Overview Eflatun Pƒ±nar's location near the lake shore corresponds to an almost exact level with other important ruins on the opposite shore, those of Kubadabad Palace, which were built by Seljuks. Eflatun Pƒ±nar was briefly examined by the University of Oxford archaeologist Dr. Lucia Nixon in her paper on √áatalh√∂y√ºk, and she makes use of F.W.Hasluck's early-20th century work.

(\\"Agram\\" is the old German name for Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.) The vast numbers of ex-special forces Agrams in Croatia after the Croatian War of Independence, as well as the availability of a sound suppressor, has made it a popular choice for criminals. Infamously unreliable in the war period due to its poorly constructed magazines, it would often fail to feed rounds from the magazine, decreasing its commercial demand outside of Croatia and transnational criminal organizations of the time. The Agram 2000, like the Beretta M12 was chambered for the 9x19mm Parabellum cartridge which in those days was exceptionally popular. These weapons were used in the Kosovo war for both sides of the conflict, and were preferred due to its full-auto fire, provisions for silencer, flexible ammunition count and compact size. These days the 2000 series is a rarity outside of the Balkan areas, because even though it is still produced in Croatia, today its production has been scaled down. Mainly produced between 1990 and 1993, since 1997 only a few more examples were produced, the reason for this being the Agram 2000 is locally manufactured and there is no more conflict or demand for a fully auto SMG in the region anymore, and low demand due to poor and cheap construction. Specifications The most unique feature on this gun is the thumb-hole foregrip that ensures a firm grip and good recoil control while firing fully auto. The charging handle is on the left hand side of the receiver, just above the magazine. The fire selector is found just above the trigger which allows for safety, single-shot, and full-auto firing modes (S/1/A). The barrel shroud is perforated for heat dispersion and sports a front iron sight post. The rear sight is a flip-up sight that can dial its zero up to 150 meters. Some sources report that it has a rate of fire of 800 RPM. The barrel is slightly longer and is threaded to enable the attachment of a silencer or muzzle brake. and can sport a silencer or a muzzle brake as required. The materials used for making this weapon include stamped, sheet metal and molded plastic. The specifications for the buttstock do not exist. The Agram 2000 measures at about 13.8 inches without the silencer on.

It is printed in Spanish and, since 3 May 2011, also in Catalan (Spanish copy is automatically translated into Catalan). It has its headquarters in Barcelona and is Catalonia's leading newspaper. ', despite being mostly distributed in Catalonia, has Spain's fourth-highest circulation among general-interest newspapers, trailing only the three main Madrid dailies ‚Äì ', ' and ABC, all of which are national newspapers with offices and local editions throughout the country. Its editorial line leans to the centre of politics and is moderate in its opinions, although in Francoist Spain it followed Francoist ideology and to this day has Catholic sensibilities and strong ties to the Spanish nobility through the God√≥ family. History and profile First issue of La Vanguardia, 1881 La Vanguardia's newspaper history began in Barcelona on 1 February 1881 when two businessmen from Igualada, Carlos and Bartolom√© God√≥, first published the paper. It was defined as a Diario pol√≠tico de avisos y not√≠cias (Political Newspaper of Announcements and News), intended as a means of communication for a faction of the Liberal Party that wanted to gain control over the Barcelona city council. On 31 December 1887, the paper published its last edition as a party organ, and the next day, 1 January 1888, the first day of the Universal Exposition of Barcelona, it presented a new, politically independent format with morning and afternoon editions. It is one of the oldest papers in Spain, and is the only Catalan newspaper that has survived all the Spanish regime changes, from the restoration of Alfonso XII to the 21st century. La Vanguardia is part of the Grupo God√≥. Carlos God√≥ Valls took over the business in 1931. His death was one year after the death of his wife, Montserrat Munta√±ola Trinxet, succeeding as President his son Javier God√≥ Munta√±ola in 1987. From 1939 to 1978 its title included the word Espa√±ola to better accommodate the new state ideology. The paper was one of two major dailies in Francoist Spain together with ABC. In the late 1970s and 1980s La Vanguardia had close connections with Convergence and Union alliance. In 1987 La Vanguardia received the second largest amount of state aid. La Vanguardia was published in berliner format until 2 October 2007 when it began to use tabloid format. The daily was awarded the World's Best Designed Newspaper for 1994 by the Society for News Design (SND). Circulation The circulation of La Vanguardia was 221,451 copies in February 1970 and 218,390 copies in February 1975. Five years later the circulation of the paper was 188,555 copies in February 1980. In 1993 La Vanguardia had a circulation of 208,029 copies, making it the fifth best selling newspaper in Spain. In 1994 it was the fourth best selling newspaper in the country with a circulation of 207,112 copies. La Vanguardia had a circulation of 205,000 copies in 2001. Its circulation was 203,000 copies in 2003. Between June 2006 and July 2007 the daily had a circulation of 209,735 copies. The 2008 circulation of the paper was 213,413 copies.

Fairlie in the 1870s. Robert Francis Fairlie (born either March 1831 or 5 April 1830, in Glasgow, died 31 July 1885, in London) was a Scottish-born railway engineer.  Early life  Fairlie was born in Glasgow, the son of T. Archibald Fairlie (an engineer) and Margaret Fairlie. He trained at Crewe and Swindon railway works, then joined first the Londonderry and Coleraine Railway as Locomotive Superintendent in 1852, and four years later the Bombay, Baroda & Central India Railway before returning to London in 1859 to establish himself as a railway engineering consultant.  Ffestiniog Railway  He is chiefly known for the invention of the Fairlie double-bogie articulated locomotive (patented in 1864) that is particularly associated with tightly curved railways and especially narrow gauge mountain lines. The first such, the Pioneer, was built in 1865 for the Neath and Brecon Railway, but it was with the Little Wonder built in 1869 for the Festiniog Railway that Fairlie made his name as the inventor of something special. On the Festiniog Railway the new locomotive was tested against the railway's existing George England and Co. four-coupled tank locomotives. A series of tests, for which detailed performance records survive, were held between 18 September 1869 and 8 July 1870. Little Wonder with train of four-wheeled passenger carriages at Portmadoc harbour station on the Festiniog Railway c1870. David Lloyd George built new in 1991, one of several double Fairlie locomotives operated by the Ffestiniog Railway today. On 11 February 1870, a formal demonstration was held, for invited guests from around the world, including: The Duke of Sutherland; Mr W. T. Mulvany, from Prussia; M. Tolme, engineer; M. Phillippe Kremer from Paris, engaged on the Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod Railway; Mr Christer P.

Tyler, Government Inspecting Officer for Railways; Mr Preston, engaged on the railway from Tiflis to the Caucasus, in Turkey and Russia; Gen. Sir William Baker, K.C.B.; Mr Power, M.P ., connected with the Mexico and Vera Cruz Railways; Mr Pille [i.e. Carl Abraham Pihl], Sweden; Mr Ayrton, Mr Elias, general manager, Cambrian Railways; Mr Poole, local traffic manager ditto; Mr Charles E.

Thornton, ditto; Mr Livingston Thompson, Chairman and managing director, Festiniog Railway Company; Mr Dallas, The Times newspaper, and Mr Thomas Cargill, engineer & reporter of the Engineering Gazette Further parties of engineers and managers came to Porthmadog on four later occasions in 1870 to observe the locomotive at work.The North Wales Chronicle and the Carnarvon & Denbigh Herald, February 1870. Fairlie received many orders and commissions following the trials. In 1873-1874 he travelled to Venezuela, but this trip resulted in a serious illness. By 1876 forty three railways operated Fairlie's patent locomotives, not always successfully.  Elopement and marriage However, Robert Fairlie's professional career and social standing had been seriously threatened eight years earlier by a remarkable case (reported in The Times of 8 April 1862) brought against him in the Central Criminal Court by his longtime business associate, George England, who alleged perjury on the part of Robert Francis Fairlie who had eloped with England's daughter Eliza Anne England and, to procure a marriage licence, had sworn a false affidavit that her father, Mr George England, had consented to the union, which was not true. After this marriage they had run away to Spain. This accusation would, if proved, have resulted in a prison sentence. Under cross-examination by Sergeant Ballantyne (who appeared for Fairlie), George England was forced to admit that he had run away with his present wife, who was the mother of the young lady in question, and that he had a wife living at that time. He had lived with this lady several years but could not marry her until his wife died. By a quirk of English law, at that time, a child born out of wedlock was considered nobody's child. In law she was nothing to do with George England and could marry whom she pleased. There was no case to answer and therefore a verdict of not guilty was returned. But none of this stopped George England building Robert Fairlie's remarkable double-engine for the Ffestiniog Railway seven years later. Fairlie's Little Wonder was delivered to the FR in the summer of 1869 and George England retired. In September 1869 Robert Fairlie joined with George England's son and J.S. Fraser to take over the Hatcham Works and to form the Fairlie Engine & Steam Carriage Co. but George England junior died within a few months. Locomotive production ceased at the end of 1870 but the Fairlie Engine & Rolling Stock Co. continued as an office for design and for the licensing of Fairlie locomotive manufacture. George England died in 1878, and by 1881 Fairlie and his wife Eliza were living at 13 Church Buildings, Clapham with theirthe Charterhouse School census for 1881 children, Robert, John, Lily and Jessie (their other son, Frank, was at Charterhouse School as a boarder at the time of the 1881 Census) and Robert's mother in law, Sarah England.

Best known for his power hitting, Suttles was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006.  Negro league career  Born in Edgewater, Alabama, Suttles played one game for the Atlantic City Bacharach Giants in 1921, and broke into the Negro National League in 1923 with the Birmingham Black Barons. Suttles was renowned for hitting for power as well as batting average. In five years with the Stars (1926‚Äì1930), he led the league in home runs twice and in doubles, triples, and batting average once each. Suttles' final seasons were spent playing first base for the Newark Eagles' \\"Million Dollar Infield\\" with Dick Seay at second, Willie Wells at shortstop, and Ray Dandridge at third.

The novel, a bildungsroman for the adolescent character Gair, discusses the relationship among three different races in a manner that can be read as a parable of race relations in humans. Plot summary The story begins when two Lyman siblings, Orban and Adara, accidentally revert a shapeshifted bird on an English moor back into a small Dorig. The Dorig is holding an exquisitely moulded collar, which in Lyman and Dorig culture are used to store protective magic. When Orban tries to take the collar, the Dorig says he is the son of the Dorig king, and will curse the collar before giving it up. Orban kills the Dorig and takes the collar anyway, and as the Dorig dies he binds a curse to the collar by the three Powers ‚Äì the Old Power, the Middle Power and the New Power. Orban grows up to be chief of the Otmound mound. Adara marries Gest, chief of the Garholt mound, and has three children: Ayna, Gair, and Ceri. At a young age, Ayna and Ceri discover they have powerful magical talents called \\"Gifts\\" ‚Äì Ayna has precognition, and Ceri can find anything when asked. Gair, the middle child, becomes increasingly gloomy when he fails to develop a Gift. When Gair is twelve, the Dorig ‚Äì at war with the Lyman ever since Orban killed the prince ‚Äì flood the Otmound mound. The Otmounders move into the Garholt mound, bringing with them bad luck which gets worse and worse. Ayna, Ceri, and Gair are exploring the moors one day when they come across two young Giants, whom the siblings follow back to their house. When they are discovered, a cultural exchange takes place. The Giants inform them that there are plans to flood the moor to provide drinking water for England. The siblings, the Giants, and two Dorigs must work together to stop the Moor from being destroyed. The bad luck is found to be emanating from the collar Orban had stolen from the Dorig prince, still strongly cursed. The three races can deactivate it together, or not at all. It turns out that Gair is not so ordinary as he had expected himself to be. His fame grew later throughout the Moor and was known for his magnificent collar, of the finest Dorig work. He was also known to have the rarest Gift of all, and that is the Gift of Sight Unasked. Species Three different species live on the Moor: =Lymen= Lymen live in villages inside huge, hollow mounds. They fear the Giants and are at war with the Dorig. They operate their magic/technology with Words. They are warlike and like hunting, but they usually will not kill unless they have to. A few have special attributes called Gifts which enable them to use a special magical skill (e.g. see the future). Their clothes are the colour of the Moor, so they can camouflage with the long grasses, shadows, and trees. They look like humans, but are a little smaller, thinner, and have almond-shaped eyes which are the same colour as a human's. Their Power comes from the Sun, the Middle Power. =Dorig= Dorig live in halls under water. They have airlocks and working pumps. They, too, fear the Giants and they are at war with the Lymen. The Dorig have only the barest minimum of knowledge about Words and do not seem to have Gifts, but can shapeshift. They are rather peaceful, but are not reluctant to kill. Their real clothes are soft, and made of fish-skins that are prepared to shift shape along with the Dorig that is wearing them. When Dorig come to the surface, they don a hard, scaly armour that covers them head to foot and also shifts shape along with them. They are as tall as Lymen, very pale with a greenish tinge to their skin, and have large, yellow eyes. Their accent has a lilting sound, and they trail their s's. Their Power comes from the Moon, the Old Power. =Giants= Giants are humans. They have machines that work by themselves, great big pieces of metal that smell bad and take them where they want, great strength, loud voices, boxes that release sound, and objects which they use to fire stone-like round things that can hurt or kill. The Lymen and the Dorig fear them, but the humans are unaware of the Lymen and Dorig. They wear many-coloured clothes with much decoration that fasten in \\"mysterious ways\\" (zippers). Their Power comes from the Earth, the New Power. Characters The main characters of this book are three Lymen siblings: Ayna, Ceri and Gair. Both Ayna and Ceri are blessed with \\"Gifts\\". Ayna can tell the future, and Ceri can find anything that has been lost and can put thoughts on people. Putting thoughts on people is like controlling someone or something's actions by putting a hex on it. Gair is supposedly without a Gift but later on is revealed to have one. Other characters include: * Adara ‚Äì Mother of Ayna, Ceri and Gair. She is said to be very wise and beautiful. * Gest ‚Äì Father of Ayna, Ceri and Gair. He is chief of Garholt, which is the biggest mound. He is often called a Hero, and is known for being charismatic and unique. He mysteriously completed three tasks to win Adara's hand in marriage. * Orban ‚Äì Adara's brother; uncle to Ayna, Ceri and Gair. He is chief of the Otmound mound. * Ondo ‚Äì Orban's son and cousin to Ayna, Ceri and Gair. The three kids hate him for being an obnoxious bully. His distinguishing feature are ears that stick out like a sheep's. * Kasta ‚Äì Orban's wife, and the spoiling mother of Ondo. Known for having a voice like a duck's. * Gerald ‚Äì A giant that tries to help the threesome. He and Gair are particularly good friends, because they can relate to one another. They are both rather lonely and melancholy. * Brenda ‚Äì Another, very fat, giant. She and Gerald are fighting when the threesome first meet them. * Hafny ‚Äì A Dorig that Ayna, Ceri and Gair befriend. He is much more open-minded than most Dorigs, and occupies roughly the same place in Dorig society as Gair does in Lymen society. * Halla ‚Äì Hafny's sister. She has a tendency to be rather unintelligent and stereotypically minded.

Dickens World was a themed attraction located in the Chatham Dockside retail park in Kent, England. It was themed around elements of the life and work of Charles Dickens. After a soft opening in April, Dickens World officially opened to the public on 25 May 2007. It closed on 12 October 2016. The concept First conceived as far back as the 1970s, Dickens World was designed by Gerry O'Sullivan-Beare, who also created Santa World in Sweden and Andersen World. It cost ‚Ç§62 million. Designers RMA Ltd worked closely with Dickens World and the Dickens Fellowship to ensure that the production of authentic storylines, characters, atmospheric streets, courtyards, and alleyways were true to the period. Dickens World was based around the life of author Charles Dickens, briefly a resident of Chatham as a child and who, as an adult, lived at Gad's Hill Place in nearby Higham. Many of the locations and characters in his novels are based on buildings, places and people of the Medway Towns. Holcombe Manor was the inspiration for Dingley Dell, the house in Pickwick Papers, and some of Edwin Drood takes place in Rochester Cathedral. Dickens World was an indoor attraction, centred on a courtyard with facades of buildings related to Dickens, like Warren's Blacking. Unlike many other theme parks, Dickens World was not designed to guide visitors through any particular path, but enabled them to structure their own experience. Original Attractions When Dickens World first opened it included a Great Expectations-themed water ride, a Haunted House, a 4D movie at Peggotty's boathouse, an animatronic show in a mock-up Britannia Theatre, an interactive schoolhouse based on Dotheboys Schoolhouse, a \\"Fagin's den\\" play area for children, and \\"The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters\\", a themed bar and restaurant. Visitors exited into a gift shop called The Olde Curiosity Shoppe. The Great Expectations ride took visitors through scenes of Victorian London and ended with a simulated drop from a sewer into the River Thames. Though featuring Magwitch, the ride did not follow the plot of Great Expectations. Instead, it emphasised the criminal elements of Dickens' novel, featuring a jail filled with criminal characters from several of the writer's books. That ride closed in 2013. The 4D film in Peggotty's Boathouse told the story of Dickens, featuring an inflatable Catherine Dickens, a winking Nellie Ternan, and a spray of water in the face during the Dickenses' trip to America. The whole is framed with a magic lantern theme. That attraction closed in 2013. At Dotheboys Schoolhouse visitors experience a Victorian classroom. Touch-screens replaced slates, and visitors took a quiz on Dickens' life and works. The haunted house was first advertised as Ebenezer Scrooge's house, but before the grand opening was renamed the Haunted House of 1859, possibly alluding to Dickens' Christmas story, \\"A Haunted House,\\" published that year. The house featured a Pepper's ghost effect. Administration and restructuring The original company Dickens World Ltd placed itself in administration when unable to meet a ¬£6 million tax bill, and investors lost ¬£32 million. Former director, Ed De Lucy, explained that the attraction was losing between ¬£500,000 and ¬£1m each year, and only the revenue from the adjacent Odeon Theatre and Porter's restaurant had kept the attraction open. The new owners reduced the prices to ¬£6.50 a head and the boat trip ride was removed. From 23 March 2013, the venue offered a guide-led walking tour where the visitors met costumed characters, and intended to host weddings and corporate events. Dickens World officially closed in October 2016 when the restructuring and refinancing company pulled out of negotiations. The staff were informed by text messages and email that the company had ceased to operate. Use by the media The Hoosiers used Dickens World as the location for their fourth single's video Cops and Robbers in March 2008.

Biography  He seemed to have settled initially in Kefar 'Othnai in Lower Galilee,Babylonian Talmud, Gittin 10b (Mishnah Gittin 1:5; 7:7) but with the outbreak of the war with Rome, he fled to Jerusalem. From there, he moved to Yavne. In Yavne, during the siege of Jerusalem, the scribes of the school of Hillel had taken refuge by permission of Vespasian, and a new centre of Judaism arose under the leadership of the aged Johanan ben Zakkai, a school whose members inherited the authority of the Sanhedrin of Jerusalem. He was appointed nasi in approximately the year 80 CE. =Leadership= Gamaliel II became Johanan ben Zakkai's successor, and rendered immense service in the strengthening and reintegration of Judaism, which had been deprived of its former basis by the destruction of the Second Temple and by the entire loss of its political autonomy. He put an end to the division which had arisen between the spiritual leaders of Judaism by the separation of the scribes into the two schools called respectively after Hillel and Shammai, and took care to enforce his own authority as the president of the chief legal assembly of Judaism with energy and often with severity. He did this, as he himself said, not for his own honor nor for that of his family, but in order that disunion should not prevail in Israel. Gamaliel's position was recognized by the Roman government also, and he journeyed to Syria for the purpose of being confirmed in office by the governor.·º°Œ≥Œµ¬µœéŒΩ; Eduyot 7:7; Sanhedrin 11b Towards the end of Domitian's reign (c. 95 CE), he went to Rome in company with the most prominent members of the school of Yavneh, in order to avert a danger threatening the Jews from the action of the emperor.Gr√§tz, \\"Geschichte,\\" 3d ed., iv. 109 Many interesting particulars have been given regarding the journey of these learned men to Rome and their sojourn there.see Bacher, \\"Ag. Tan.\\" i. 84 The impression made by the capital of the world upon Gamaliel and his companions was an overpowering one, and they wept when they thought of Jerusalem in ruins. In Rome, as at home, Gamaliel often had occasion to defend Judaism in polemical discussions with pagans, and also with professed Christians.see Bacher, \\"Ag. Tan.\\" i. 85 He may have been the first to receive the title \\"nasi\\" (prince; later replaced by \\"patriarch\\"), given to raise him in public estimation and to revive the Biblical designation for the head of the nation. This title later became hereditary with his descendants. = Leadership controversy = Gamaliel was a controversial leader. In a dispute about fixing the calendar, Rabban Gamaliel humiliated Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah by asking him to show up with his \\"stick and satchel\\" (weekday attire) on the holy day which according to Rabbi Joshua's calculation was Yom Kippur.Rosh Hashana 25a,b Later on, another dispute broke out regarding the status of the nightly prayer, and he humiliated him again by asking him to stand up, and to remain standing while teaching his students. This incident shocked the Rabbis, and subsequently is said to have led to a rabbinic revolt against Gamaliel's leadership of the Sanhedrin. The Sanhedrin installed Rabbi Eleazar Ben Azariah as the new Nasi. After reconciling with Rabbi Joshua, Rabban Gamaliel was reinstated as Nasi, with Rabbi Eleazar serving along with him in a rotation every third week. According to the version recorded in the Jerusalem Talmud, Rabbi Eleazar served as Av Beit Din, a viceregent.Berakhot 28a, JT Berakhot 4:1 Gamaliel, however, showed that with him it was only a question of principle, and that he had no intention of humiliating Joshua; for, rising and kissing him on the head, he greeted him with the words: \\"Welcome, my master and my pupil: my master in learning; my pupil in that you submit to my will.\\" Similarly, he was implicated in the 'excommunication' of his own brother-in-law,Shabbat 116a; Bava Metziah 59b Eliezer ben Hyrcanus.Jacob Neusner, https://books.google.com/books?id=dMkUAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA263 Eliezer Ben Hyrcanus: The Tradition and the Man, Volume 2, Brill Archive, 1973 p.263. His goal was to strengthen the authority of the assembly at Yavneh as well as his own authority, and thus brought upon himself the suspicion of seeking his own glory. However, Gamaliel describes his motivations in this episode as in the following prayer: \\"Lord of the world, it is manifest and known to Thee that I have not done it for my own honor nor for that of my house, but for Thy honor, that factions may not increase in Israel.\\"Bava Metziah 59b A story which confirms Gamaliel's claim to modesty is told, in which he, standing, served his guests himself at a feast.Sifre to Deuteronomy 38; Kiddushin 32b Gamaliel's greatest achievement was ending of the opposition between the schools of Hillel and Shammai, which had survived even the destruction of the Temple. According to tradition, a voice from heaven was heard in Yavneh, declaring that although the views of both schools were justifiable in principle (as \\"words of the living God\\"), in practice the views of Hillel's school are authoritative.Yerushalmi Berachot 3b; Eruvin 13b =Anecdotes= Many of Gamaliel's decisions in religious law are connected with his stay in some place in the Holy Land. In Ecdippa the archisynagogue Scipio asked him a question which he answered by letter after his return home.Tosefta Terumot 2:13 There are also records of Gamaliel's stay in Kfar Uthnai,Gittin 1:5; Tosefta Gitin 1:4 in Emmaus,Hullin 91b in Lod,Tosefta Pesachim 2:10, 10:end in JerichoTosefta Berachot 4:15 in Samaria,Tosefta Demai 5:24 and in Tiberias.Tosefta Shabbat 13:2 He was on friendly terms with many non-Jews, and was so warmly devoted to his slave TaviSukkah 2:1 that when Tavi died he mourned for him as for a beloved member of his own family.Brachot 2:7 A friendly conversation is recorded which he had with a heathen on the way from Acre to Ecdippa.Eruvin 64b On the Sabbath he sat upon the benches of heathen merchants.Tosefta, Moed Kattan 2:8 Still, Gamaliel and his sister, Ima Shalom, chided with the growing local Christian population, even mocking a certain gentile judge who had adjudicated in an inheritance case, in which Ima Shalom had made herself the make-believe claimant in the case. When the judge at first ruled in favor of the woman, after being given a bribe by Rabban Gamaliel, he quickly rescinded the verdict in favor of Gamaliel. The story includes a reference to the words of Jesus in Matthew 5:17, with one possible reading of the story indicating that it was Gamaliel making this reference.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 116a-b Another encounter with Christianity came when he debated the \\"min,\\" or philosopher, who maliciously concluded from Hosea 5:6 that God had completely forsaken Israel.Yebamot 102b; Midrash Tehillim to Psalms 10, end; most completely reproduced from the old source in Midrash HaGadol to Leviticus 26:9, in Bacher, \\"Ag. Tan.\\" 2d ed., i. 83 The memory of the destroyed Temple was especially vivid in Gamaliel's heart. Gamaliel and his companions wept over the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple when they heard the noise of the great city of Rome, and at another time when they stood on the Temple ruins.Sifre Deuteronomy 43; Makkot 24a; Lamentations Rabbah 5:18 =Death= Gamaliel died before the insurrections under Trajan had brought fresh unrest into Israel. At his funeral the celebrated proselyte Aquila, reviving an ancient custom for the burial of kings, burned costly materials to the value of seventy minae;Tosefta Shabbat 7(8):18; Avodah Zarah 11a and Eliezer b. Hyrcanus and Joshua b. Hananiah, the aged teachers of the Law, arranged the ceremonies for his funeral.Moed Kattan 27a; Yerushalmi Moed Kattan 82a Gamaliel himself had directed that his body be wrapped in the simplest possible shroud. By this he wished to check the extravagance which had become associated with funerals, and his end was attained; his example became the rule, and it also became the custom to commemorate him in the words of consolation addressed to the mourners.Ketuvot 8b Of Gamaliel's children, one daughter is known, who answered in a very intelligent fashion two questions addressed to her father by an unbeliever.Sanhedrin 34a, 90b Two of Gamaliel's sons are mentioned as returning from a certain feast.Berachot 1:2 One son, Simon, inherited his office long after his father's death, and after the Hadrianic persecutions, which thenceforward his descendants handed on from father to son. It cannot be regarded as proved that the tanna Haninah ben Gamaliel was a son of Gamaliel II;B√ºchler, \\"Die Priester und der Cultus,\\" p. 14 this is more likely to be true of Judah ben Gamaliel, who reports a decision in the name of Haninah ben Gamaliel.Tosefta Avodah Zarah, 4(5):12; Avodah Zarah 39b Teachings =Halacha= Aside from his official position, Gamaliel stood in learning on an equal footing with the legal teachers of his time. Many of his halakhic opinions have been handed down. Sometimes the united opinion of Gamaliel and Eliezer ben Hyrcanus is opposed to that of Joshua ben HananiahKetubot 1:6-9 and sometimes Gamaliel holds a middle position between the stricter opinion of the one and the more lenient view of the other.Shevuot 9:8; Terumot 8:8 Gamaliel assented to certain principles of civil law which have been transmitted in the name of Admon, a former judge in Jerusalem, and which became especially well known and were authoritative for ensuing periods.Ketubot 14:3-5 Various details have been handed down by tradition concerning the religious practises of Gamaliel and his house.See the following Tosefta passages: Demai 3:15; Shabbat 1:22, 12(13),end; Yom Tov 1:22; 2:10,13,14,16 In Gamaliel's house it was not customary to say \\"Marpe'!\\" (Recovery) when any one sneezed, because that was a heathenish superstition.Tosefta, Shabbat 7(8):5; compare Berachot 53a Two concessions were made to Gamaliel's household in the way of relaxing the severity of the rules set up as a barrier against heathendom: permission to use a mirror in cutting the hair of the head,Tosefta Avodah Zarah 3:5; compare Yerushalmi Avodah Zarah 41a and to learn Greek.Tosefta Sotah 15:8; Sotah, end In regard to the latter, Gamaliel's son Simon relates that many children were instructed in his father's house in \\"Greek wisdom.\\"Sotah 49b He directed Simeon ha-Pakoli to edit the Amidah and make it a duty, incumbent on every one, to recite the prayer three times daily. Also, he directed Samuel ha-Katan to write another paragraph against informers and heretics.Babylonian Talmud Megilah 17b, Berachos 28b Another liturgical institution goes back to Gamaliel‚Äîthat of the memorial celebration which takes the place of the sacrifice of the Passover lamb on the first evening of Passover. Gamaliel instituted this celebration,Pesachim 10:5 which may be regarded as the central feature of the Passover Haggadah, on an occasion when he spent the first Passover night with other scholars at Lydda in conversing about the feast and its customs.Tosefta Pesachim 10 112 =Aggadah= Gamaliel uses striking comparisons in extolling the value of handiwork and laborTosefta Kiddushin 1:11 and in expressing his opinion on the proper training of the mind.Avot of Rabbi Natan 28 Gamaliel's appreciation of the virtue of mercy is well illustrated by a saying of his in allusion to Deuteronomy 13:18: \\"Let this be a token unto thee! So long as thou thyself art compassionate God will show thee mercy; but if thou hast no compassion, God will show thee no mercy\\".Tosefta Bava Kamma 9:30; Yerushalmi Bava Kamma l.c.; compare Shabbat 151a Gamaliel portrays the distress and corruption of the times in a remarkable speech which concludes with an evident reference to the emperor Domitian. He says: \\"Since lying judges have the upper hand, lying witnesses also gain ground; since evil-doers have increased, the seekers of revenge are also increasing; since shamelessness has augmented, men have lost their dignity; since the small says to the great. 'I am greater than thou,' the years of men are shortened; since the beloved children have angered their Father in heaven, He has placed a ruthless king over them [with reference to Job 34:20]. Such a king was Ahasuerus, who first killed his wife for the sake of his friend, and then his friend for the sake of his wife\\".Introduction to Midrash Abba Gorion, beginning; Esther Rabbah, beginning He loved discussing the sense of single portions of the Bible with other scholars, and made many fine expositions of the text. There are records of four such discussions,Bava Batra 10b (on Proverbs 14:34); Hullin 92a (on Genesis 40:10); Shabbat 55b (on Genesis 49:4); Megillah 12b (on Esther 5:4) which all end with Gamaliel's expressed desire to hear the opinion of the eminent aggadist Eleazar of Modi'im. The lament over his favorite pupil, Samuel haKatan, which he made in common with Eleazar b. Azariah, is very touching: \\"It is fitting to weep for him; it is fitting to lament for him. Kings die and leave their crowns to their sons; the rich die and leave their wealth to their sons; but Samuel haKaton has taken with him the most precious thing in the world‚Äîhis wisdom‚Äîand is departed\\".Semachot 8 The Roman yoke borne by the Jewish people of Palestine weighed heavily upon Gamaliel. In one speechAvot of Rabbi Natan 28 he portrays the tyranny of Rome that devours the property of its subjects. He reflects on the coming of the Messiah, and describes the period which shall precede His appearance as one of the deepest moral degradation and direst distress.Derekh Eretz Zuta 10 But he preaches also of the fruitfulness and blessing which shall at some time distinguish the land of Israel.Shabbat 30b References * * External links * Perspectives on Transformational Leadership in the Sanhedrin of Ancient Judaism * Parshat terumah (from Hillel) Category:Mishnah rabbis Category:1st- century rabbis Category:Burials in Israel ","title":"Gamaliel II"},{"id":"3666379","text":"Plectrurus aureus, commonly known as the Kerala burrowing snake or Kerala shieldtail,The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. is a species of uropeltid snake endemic to India.

He was a cousin of Charles Darwin, whom his sister Emma married in 1839. Early life Wedgwood was born at Tarrant Gunville in Dorset, the fourth son of Josiah Wedgwood II and Elizabeth Allen of Cresselly, Pembrokeshire. He was educated at Rugby School, then entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1820 but switched to Christ's College the following year. Though he did well in maths, graduating as 8th wrangler, he finished bottom in the classical tripos at Cambridge in 1824, for which he was awarded the first \\"wooden wedge\\", equivalent to the wooden spoon, and jokingly named for him. Career After leaving Cambridge, Wedgwood read for the chancery bar. In 1828, he qualified as a barrister, but never practised. Between 1831 and 1837, he served as a police magistrate and sat at the Surrey magistrates' court at Union Hall, Southwark. A notable case that came before him during his tenure was that of James Pratt and John Smith in 1835, whom he committed to trial after their arrest for homosexual acts. After their trial and conviction at the Central Criminal Court, the two became the last to be executed for sodomy in England. This was in spite of Wedgwood himself calling for a commutation of their death sentences in a letter to the Home Secretary.Cocks (2010) p.38Upchurch (2009), p. 112. Wedgwood resigned from the magistracy after deciding that one of his duties, the administrations of oaths, was inconsistent with the commandments of the New Testament. Between 1838 and 1849, he held the post of Registrar of Metropolitan Public Carriage. His main fields of study were philology and etymology. His Dictionary of Etymology was published in 1857. He was a founding member of the Philological Society. Spiritualism Wedgwood became interested in spiritualism and attended s√©ances. In 1874, he attempted to get T.H. Huxley involved in spiritualism by sending him an alleged spirit photograph. Huxley was not impressed and suggested the photograph had been produced fraudulently by the use of a second image placed on the plate inside the camera. Hensleigh refused to believe this explanation and considered the photograph to be genuine.Browne, E. Janet. (2003). Charles Darwin: The Power of Place, Volume 2. Princeton University Press. p. 404. Wedgwood was a member of the British National Association of Spiritualists and a vice-president of the Society for Psychical Research.Oppenheim, Janet. (1988).

It was formed in 1918 in Czechoslovakia through the unification of the Protestant churches of the Lutheran and Reformed confessions. In 2019, church reported 69,715 baptized membersLWF Statistics - Czech-republic The Lutheran World Federation in more than 260 local congregations, which are broken down into 14 seniorates (presbyteries) throughout the Czech Republic.

Origins Reformation in the Czech lands started already in the 15th century, one century before the great Luther's Reformation. At that time, most Czechs (~85%) were Protestant; there were two Protestant churches: the Utraquist Hussite Church (1431‚Äì1620) and the Unity of the Brethren (1457‚Äì1620). (The latter was in the 1720s partially renewed outside of Czech territory as the Moravian Church.) However, non- Catholic churches were forbidden in 1620, when the Bohemian Revolt was decisively defeated and victorious Habsburg rulers imposed harsh Counter- Reformation measures on the Bohemian Crown. This ban was mitigated in 1781 by issuing the Patent of Toleration that permitted Lutheran and Reformed churches in the Habsburg Monarchy (yet full equality with Catholic faith and equality before the law Protestants only obtained as late as in 1867, when Austria- Hungary was created). Nevertheless, other minor churches were still forbidden until the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. The ECCB was established in 1918 by unification of all Lutheran and Reformed churches in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia intending to be an successor of the Unity of the Brethren (and the Bohemian Reformation in general). The ECCB is a member of the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, the Lutheran World Federation and the World Communion of Reformed Churches.

The first Key West lighthouse was a tower completed in 1825. It had 15 lamps in reflectors. The first keeper, Michael Mabrity, died in 1832, and his widow, Barbara, became the lighthouse keeper, serving for 32 years. The Great Havana Hurricane of 1846 destroyed the lighthouse; the USS Morris, which was wrecked during the storm, reported \\"a white sand beach covers the spot where Key West Lighthouse stood\\". Barbara Mabrity survived, but fourteen people who had sought refuge in the lighthouse tower died, including seven members of her family. (The same hurricane destroyed the Sand Key Lighthouse, eight miles (13 km) away, killing six people, including the keeper, Rebecca Flaherty, another widow of a previous keeper.) Barbara Mabrity continued to serve as keeper of the Key West Light until the early 1860s, when she was fired at age 82 for making statements against the Union (Key West remained under Union control throughout the Civil War). As both lighthouses serving Key West had been destroyed in the 1846 hurricane, a ship, the Honey, was acquired and outfitted as a lightship to serve as the Sand Key Light until new lighthouses could be built. Due to efforts to reorganize the Lighthouse Board, Congress was slow to appropriate funds for the new lighthouses. The new tower for the Key West Light was completed in 1848. It was tall with 13 lamps in reflectors, and stood on ground about above sea level. In 1858 the light received a third order Fresnel lens. In 1873 the lantern was replaced (it had been damaged by a hurricane in 1866), adding three feet to the height of the tower. The growth of trees and taller buildings in Key West began to obscure the light, and in 1894 the tower was raised twenty feet, placing the light about above sea level. After the Coast Guard decommissioned the Key West Light in 1969, it was turned over to Monroe County, which in turn leased it to the Key West Arts and Historical Society. The society operates the lighthouse and its associated buildings as the Key West Light House and Keeper's Quarters Museum. On display at the museum is the first order Fresnel lens from the Sombrero Key lighthouse.

The company was founded by William Peck, Edinburgh's City Astronomer, to develop the emerging technology of electricity. Madelvic produced an 'electric brougham' at their factory in Granton, north Edinburgh, between 1898 and 1900. The vehicle was driven by a three-wheeled front axle unit, comprising motor, batteries and a small central wheel, set behind the axle, which propelled the car. This unit was mounted to the front of a chassis, creating a five-wheeled vehicle, but could also be attached to a horse-drawn carriage. Peck offered public transport using the car, between Granton and Leith as publicity. A more conventional front wheel drive electric vehicle was also briefly produced. However, electric cars were not to be the future, and Madelvic went bankrupt, being taken over by the Kingsburgh Motor Company in 1900. The original factory building still stands in Granton, and is currently being renovated for residential and office use. It is the oldest surviving car factory in Britain. After Madelvic ceased production, cars were built here by Kingsburgh, and then by the Stirlings Motor Carriages Ltd, who also built buses on the site, exporting some to Australia. In 1925 the buildings were bought by United Wire, and used by them until 2001 when they were purchased by the development company Waterfront Edinburgh Limited, a joint venture between City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise. Buredi, a joint venture between The Burrell Company and the City of Edinburgh Council, had hoped to redevelop the factory to create a range of residential apartments, townhouses and commercial office space. The renovation was designed by Malcolm Fraser Architects. The building is on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.

It distributes both within the UK and worldwide. It started in 1979. History =The early years= The first standalone issue of Record Collector was published in March 1980, though its history stretches back further. In 1963, publisher Sean O'Mahony (alias Johnny Dean) had launched an official Beatles magazine, The Beatles Book. Although it shut down in 1969, The Beatles Book reappeared in 1976 due to popular demand. Through the late-1970s, the small ads section of The Beatles Book became an increasingly popular avenue through which collectors could make contact and buy, sell, or trade Beatles records. Reflecting a burgeoning collecting scene in the 1970s, as time went by, the adverts were becoming dominated by traders who were interested in rare vinyl outside of that within the Beatles world. In September 1979, The Beatles Book came with a record collecting supplement, and the response was positive enough for O'Mahony to launch Record Collector as a separate entity in March 1980. =Taking off= By June 1980, Record Collector was a glossy A5 publication which ran to no more than 100 pages. With the addition of another editorial staff member ‚Äì Peter Doggett, who stayed with the magazine for almost 20 years ‚Äì Record Collector began to take shape and assume its own identity. Aimed at the collectors' market, early issues would focus largely on the music of collectable artists from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Uniquely, Record Collector features consisted of both prose pieces on the history of the artist, and detailed discographies of their UK releases. These discographies would provide all the information needed for collectors to pore over, and which enabled them to differentiate between different pressings of outwardly identical releases ‚Äì catalogue numbers, release dates and distinguishing features of the records and sleeves themselves. In particular, they would also include a valuation of each record, so that dealers and collectors had a springboard to work from. Collectors who could not travel to London and other major cities where record fairs were being held, or the biggest record dealing shops were based, found themselves limited by their situation. The mail order listings in Record Collector were important, and one of the few places for buyers and sellers to make contact with each other. At its height, this section was up to half of the publication. However, at the turn of the 21st century with the success of selling to consumers on-line via sites such as eBay, many sellers now use this type of method and the amount of listings has greatly declined. =Record Collector's aim= Since the turn of the millennium, many monthly publications such as Mojo and Uncut started to accept AOR and progressive rock music as viable musical genres. In the pre-internet days, Record Collector was the only way of reaching many genuine collectors and fans across the country. The view was that a number of music fans were feeling alienated by the arrogance and pseudo-intellectual writing of many rock journalists, and it sought to provide a publication for fans of the music, regardless of style, genre or mass popularity. Many Record Collector features were written by the collectors and fans themselves, who knew the facts and had the passion that the magazine required. =Record Collector's standing= With an 'open door' editorial policy, nostalgic outlook and focus on discographies and collectability, Record Collector has created a unique identity. Throughout the early 1980s, rival publications like Greatest Hits and the Record Hunter supplement of Vox were launched, but none of them lasted very long. It was not until the monthly Q magazine launched in 1986 ‚Äì its focus on older music fans who were buying the new CD technology of the time ‚Äì that a major competitor entered the music monthlies sector. Subsequently, in the 1990s, Classic Rock, Uncut and Mojo (who, in 2001, launched Mojo Collections as a direct competitor, though that folded after six issues and was incorporated into the main magazine) and myriad other monthly titles started, taking as their focus the nostalgic, or retrospective, outlook pioneered by Record Collector in 1980. =Record Collector's influence= In 1981, Record Collector introduced a review column focusing on an album of the month. This was before the CD boom of the mid-80s had created a widespread demand for back catalogue product, and at a time where the weekly music press had a purely contemporary outlook. The reissue review column encouraged many record companies to begin putting out reissues on a small scale, because they knew Record Collector would cover them and help generate profit. When the advent of the CD meant that many collectors needed their favourite music issued on the new format, Record Collector was already at the vanguard of covering reissued albums. More recently, there has been an upsurge in limited edition vinyl and CD releases, while ‚Äì much as the picture disc, popular in the 1980s, has become a huge source of collectability ‚Äì many modern vinyl releases are making limited and coloured formats fashionable once again, aiming themselves directly at the collecting market that Record Collector helped to establish and serve. =Currently= In 2003, Record Collector became a full colour publication ‚Äì marking the fact with a psychedelic special ‚Äì and printing 13 issues a year. The magazine was updated steadily by editor- In-chief Alan Lewis, former editor of Sounds, NME, Black Music, founding editor of Kerrang! and involved in the launches of both Uncut and Loaded. Lewis left in April 2011 and was replaced by Ian McCann, formerly of NME, Black Echoes and The Independent. His debut came with an issue focused on \\"the 51 Best Investments in vinyl\\" which drew press coverage worldwide. The magazine has since embraced multimedia, launching Facebook and Twitter feeds, and has broadened its outlook slightly, offering comment on subjects such as Amy Winehouse's death and music linked to the 2011 England riots. In 2017 McCann stepped down as editor and was succeeded by Paul Lester. Record Collector continues to serve the collector, offering retrospective features, full discographies and in depth interviews. Its outlook has expanded to embrace the phenomenon of collecting via the internet, whether it be through online trading, or downloading music. Record Collector also includes Q&A; pages where readers can have questions about their rare and obscure records answered; some of the largest news and reviews sections in music print; one of the few fanzine review columns in print; a focus on curio releases from around the world; interviews with a variety of collectors, who talk through their personal collections; and monthly features on eBay and record fairs. From being the only monthly music publication for the majority of the 80s, Record Collector has maintained its popularity well into the 2000s. Having encouraged a few trends in the reissue/collecting market, most importantly of all, Record Collector has made the collecting market more widely established and accepted, and has remained an important publication for collectors and music enthusiasts alike. > Record Collector is an important magazine because it provides a sense of > history to the scene. It assesses the importance of artists' contribution to > music, regardless of whether they are flavour of the month. As a result, > Record Collector has both rescued various artists' careers and instilled a > sense in the reader that the quality of the music and the integrity of the > artist is what really counts‚Ä¶ a human voice in a corporate environment. > --Arthur Brown The Rare Record Price Guide =History= In 1987, Record Collector published its first standalone price guide ‚Äì a slim publication, designed to be a quick and easy reference book for collectors and dealers to source information for around 2000 highly collectible artists. Five years later, in late 1992, the first edition of the Rare Record Price Guide proper was issued, which listed 60,000 rare and collectible records from a diverse array of artists. Since then, the RRPG has continued to expand and is now in its seventh edition, with over 100,000 entries that cover all musical genres. Since its inception, it has established itself as the leading book of its kind. From 2000 to 2005, the RRPG was edited by Jack Kane, a writer and expert who regularly appeared as a special guest on Marc Riley's BBC 6 Music radio programme Mint. Kane suffered from depression and took his own life in 2005 at the age of 40: Record Collector ran a full-page tribute to him, with contributions by its staff. =The RRPG= The Rare Record Price Guide features an alphabetical list of all the artists with notable collectables, and then lists each collectible release in chronological order. It includes 78rpm records, 7‚Äù, 10‚Äù and 12‚Äù vinyl singles and EPs, vinyl LPs, and cassette and CD singles and albums. Each release format has a minimum value, and if a particular release reaches or exceeds that, the RRPG features it, giving the entry full label, catalogue number, A-side and B-side listings (where applicable), distinctive features of the item and price information. To that it puts a fair, accurate and realistic valuation on each record, which serves as a barometer for buyers and sellers of rare records. All of its valuations are for records in excellent, or 'Mint' condition. Where there are different versions of the same record (for example, a limited number may have been issued in a picture sleeve), then two prices are given, to reflect that difference. The RRPG is not designed to be a complete discography of a given artist, but a reference for collectors and dealers of collectible records. Its focus is on music released from the 1950s onwards, including various artists compilations and soundtracks. For the majority of the listings, the records have to have been made commercially available in the UK. Exceptions include: *Releases from the Republic Of Ireland, which were imported into Britain, but not officially issued. *'Export Releases' manufactured in the UK in the 1950s and 1960s, and distributed to countries that did not have their own pressing plants. *Records, flexidiscs, cassettes or CDs included as freebies with magazines, books or other records. *Promotional releases, demos, test pressings and acetate recordings where they have been made available to the public, contain unique material and/or packaging, or are so important/well known among collectors that they warrant inclusion. =The RRPG Online= In the April 2010 issue of Record Collector it was announced the Rare Record Price Guide was going online. The online database contains all the latest updates, a live currency converting function, more photos and the ability for users to submit their own content.

Geodetic north differs from magnetic north (the direction a compass points toward the Magnetic North Pole), and from grid north (the direction northwards along the grid lines of a map projection). Geodetic true north also differs very slightly from astronomical true north (typically by a few arcseconds) because the local gravity may not point at the exact rotational axis of Earth. The direction of astronomical true north is marked in the skies by the north celestial pole. This is within about 1¬∞ of the position of Polaris, so that the star would appear to trace a tiny circle in the sky each sidereal day. Due to the axial precession of Earth, true north rotates in an arc with respect to the stars that takes approximately 25,000 years to complete. Around 2101‚Äì2103, Polaris will make its closest approach to the celestial north pole (extrapolated from recent Earth precession).Meeus (1997), p. 305. The visible star nearest the north celestial pole 5,000 years ago was Thuban.Ridpath (2004), p. 5. \\"Around 4800 years ago Thuban ( Draconis) lay a mere 0¬∞.1 from the pole. Deneb ( Cygni) will be the brightest star near the pole in about 8000 years' time, at a distance of 7¬∞.5.\\" On maps published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the United States Armed Forces, true north is marked with a line terminating in a five-pointed star. The east and west edges of the USGS topographic quadrangle maps of the United States are meridians of longitude, thus indicating true north (so they are not exactly parallel). Maps issued by the United Kingdom Ordnance Survey contain a diagram showing the difference between true north, grid north, and magnetic north at a point on the sheet; the edges of the map are likely to follow grid directions rather than true, and the map will thus be truly rectangular/square.

Dorsal scales moderately large, scarcely larger on the back than on the sides; ventrals broader than long, in 6 longitudinal and 25 to 29 transverse series, the median longitudinal series narrower than the others; 42 to 48 scales round the middle of the body, ventrals included. A large postero-median preanal plate. The hind limb reaches the ante-humeral fold or a little beyond the ear; the length of the foot equals the distance between the antehumeral fold and the nostril or the tip of the snout. 12 to 16 femoral pores on each side. Tail nearly twice as long as head and body; caudal scales much larger than dorsals. Brownish or golden above; a pale band, edged above with a black one, along each side of the body and tail, commencing from the supraciliary edge; another pale, black-edged band along the upper lip and side of the body; the space between the two light bands on each side usually black, or spotted with black; lower surfaces yellowish-white, tail and hind limbs often reddish.

They were founded in 1887. They have won the Cheshire Senior Cup 11 times since 1902. Their most recent success in this competition was in 2006, when they defeated Stalybridge Celtic in the final. They have also reached the FA Cup Second Round on at least three occasions. The club will play in the Northern Premier League Division One North (eighth tier of the English football league system) in the 2015‚Äì16 season. The club's ground was for many years in the centre of the town, just behind the library. In 1989, they moved a couple of miles to Chapel Street in nearby Wincham. Sainsbury's Supermarket now occupies the old Central Ground site. Witton's current home, Wincham Park, holds in excess of 4,500 and is equipped with floodlights, segregation, a club shop and a museum. There used to be a fierce local rivalry with Northwich Victoria. History The first records of a Witton Albion F.C. are in 1887. The club first entered the FA Cup in 1907‚Äì08 but failed to reach the First Round proper until 1948‚Äì49. Early on in their history the club played in a number of leagues including the Northwich & District League, Crewe & District league, Cheshire League, The Combination, The Manchester League and Lancashire Combination. Finally in 1920, the club became founder members of the Cheshire County League. They won the league three times after World War 2, including the league and cup double in 1953‚Äì54. After the formation of the Northern Premier League in 1969, many Cheshire clubs left the Cheshire County League, although Witton were denied entry on a vote. It is thought that Northwich Victoria's decision to persuade other clubs not to allow their town rivals in was the deciding factor. Albion continued to be a decent side in the Cheshire County League and eventually earned promotion to the Northern Premier League in 1978‚Äì79, when the club finished as runners-up. Although they missed out on joining their arch-rivals, as they had just left to form the Alliance Premier League. The sale of the club's Central Ground to Sainsbury's allowed the club to move to a much more modern stadium, although it was over a mile away in nearby Wincham. The second season at Wincham Park in 1990‚Äì91 proved to be one of the best seasons in the club's history as they won the NPL by 16 points, gaining promotion to the Football Conference. However, the club found this tough going and continual relegation struggles resulted in the first relegation in the club's history in 1994. A further relegation from the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League followed in 1997. In 2004, club captain Brian Pritchard enjoyed worldwide fame following his sending off during the Cheshire County F.A. Senior Cup final against Woodley Sports. He was sent off after he tripped a streaker that had run onto the pitch, incensing the Witton fans. Many football fans around the world deemed this sending off unfair, including when the referee was criticised for his decision on the BBC's Football Focus program. The 2006‚Äì07 season saw Witton miss out on automatic promotion on the last day of the season to Burscough, by 1 goal on goal difference. Witton hit the woodwork 3 times in the last 20 minutes, but were unable to score the goal that would have taken them into the Conference North as league champions. This was the second time in seven years that Burscough had beaten Witton to promotion on goal difference. Witton subsequently lost the play-off final against Telford United and were thus denied promotion into the Conference North division. Witton narrowly missed promotion again in 2007‚Äì08. After having led the Northern Premier League Premier Division since November, at one stage by 14 points, they lost the lead to Fleetwood Town in mid-April, and entered the last game of the regular season a point behind Fleetwood, but with a much better goal difference. Although Fleetwood could only manage a draw at home to Frickley Athletic in their last match, Witton lost at home 3‚Äì0 to Worksop Town and finished second. They went on to lose the first round of the promotion playoffs at home to Buxton on penalties. After the season ended, the club were wracked with management upheavals. Manager Jim Vince and assistant Nigel Deeley resigned after a disagreement with long-time charman Mike Worthington, and shortly afterwards Worthington himself severed ties with the club. Vince and Deeley were re-appointed by acting chairman Mark Harris, but Vince resigned again two weeks later on the grounds of ill-health. Nigel Deeley was appointed manager on 28 May. A substantial reduction in the playing budget led to the departure of most of the established squad members during the 2008 close season. Manager Nigel Deeley and assistant Andy Nelson were fired on November 2, after an unprecedented sequence of nine consecutive defeats. They were replaced by former manager Gary Finley, assisted by Lee Coathup. After a brief change in fortunes, when Witton moved out of the relegation zone, the Albion finished third bottom, and were relegated to the Northern Premier League First Division South. Witton entered the 2009‚Äì10 season with high hopes of promotion. Consistently in the top half of the league, they were as high as third by February 2010. However, an indifferent last third of the season saw them fall to seventh, finishing 6 points out of playoff contention. Finley resigned from the club prior to the last game of the season. League restructuring saw the club relocated to Northern Premier League First Division North for the 2010‚Äì11 season. In May 2010, former long-serving Leek Town manager Paul Ogden was appointed to the managerial position, assisted by Brian Pritchard, who will remain on the playing staff, and Dave McPherson. Six years previously, Ogden had turned down the management job at Witton, a decision which he described as 'a mistake'. On 11 April 2011 Dave MacPherson and Brian Pritchard were appointed joint managers of the club for the remainder of the 2010‚Äì11 season. Dave MacPherson left the club in the close season and Brian Pritchard became the permanent manager for the 2011‚Äì12 season. Mike Moseley, one of Albion's leading goalscorers became Assistant Player/Manager with former boss Nigel Deeley becoming First-Team Coach. On 28 April 2012, Witton beat Curzon Ashton 3‚Äì0 in the Northern Premier League Division One North Play-off Final winning promotion to the Northern Premier League (the seventh tier of the English football league system) in the 2012‚Äì13 season. An impressive 2012/13 season saw Witton finish 4th in the league making the play-off's. A 3-1 semi final defeat to FC United of Manchester brought an excellent season to a close. The 2013/14 season was tougher, with Albion finding themselves in the relegation zone for most of the season. However a good run of form inspired by club favourite Alex Titchiner the club managed to finish 16th. On Monday 25 August 2014 after beating Marine 3-1, Manager Brian Pritchard announced his resignation after 19 years at the club. He was replaced by Player/Coach Anthony Sheehan. Sheehan's reign lasted just 5 games all of which ended in defeat. He handed in his resignation and was replaced by Tony Sullivan. Sullivan moved quickly to bring in his management team appointing Kevin Hodgson and Andy Robertson to the coaching staff. Albion were relegated on the last day of the 2014/15 season. Needing only a point to guarantee league survival away at Stamford, Albion raced into a two-goal lead, however collapsed in the 2nd half eventually losing 3-2 and finding themselves finishing 22nd. Immediately after the game both Tony Sullivan and his assistant Kevin Hodgson resigned. The board moved quickly to replace Sullivan with former Norton United F.C. manager Scott Dundas taking over. However Dundas was fairly unsuccessful despite building a team of ex pro's and proven goalscorers. Dundas was sacked just two months into the season after the club slipped to its lowest league position in its history. The board replaced Dundas with ex Vauxhall Motors F.C. and Marine F.C. manager Carl MaCauley. The club also caused a stir amongst fans at the start of the 2015/16 season by allowing bitter rivals Northwich Victoria back into the town by allowing them to share their Wincham Park stadium. Rivalries The club's main rival is Northwich Victoria. Witton Albion were formed in the late 19th century by a group of Northwich Victoria players, officials and supporters who chose to break away from the Vics in protest of the clubs' decision to become a 'professional' side. Both Witton and Northwich were prominent figures during the days of the Cheshire League with Albion winning the league three times to Northwich's twice. The clubs haven't met in a league fixture since 1994, although there have been numerous local cup clashes. Good Friday 1949 saw 11,290 locals attend the derby fixture. In recent times, Witton have developed a rivalry with 1874 Northwich, a club ran by the disgruntled Northwich Victoria fans, with Witton winning 3-2 on the first meeting between the two sides in February 2015. Witton also enjoy minor rivalries with other Cheshire clubs including Altrincham and Winsford United. Notable former players Former players include Neil McNab. Liverpudlian comedian John Bishop played for the club during the late 1980s. Former Premier League striker Geoff Horsfield played for Witton during the 1990s as well as former Derby County goalkeeper Andy Oakes. Cardiff City forward Nicky Maynard spent a short spell on loan at the club during the 2005‚Äì06 season. Alex Titchiner left the club after the 2011-12 season to join League Two side Fleetwood Town, rejoining in 2014. Other players include Mike Whitlow, Dennis Viollet, Peter Mellor, Chris Nicholl and Samuel Challinor. Witton were also managed by former Manchester City players Ken Barnes and Ray Ranson. Honours Witton Albion were regular semi-finalists in the FA Trophy (1990‚Äì91, 1991‚Äì92, 1992‚Äì93). In 1992, they made it to the old Wembley Stadium where they lost to Colchester United. *FA Trophy **Runners-up: 1991‚Äì92 *Northern Premier League **Winners: 1990‚Äì91 **Runners-up: 2006‚Äì07, 2007‚Äì08 **Play-offs runners-up: 2006‚Äì07 *Northern Premier League Division One North **Play-offs winners: 2011‚Äì12 *Northern Premier League President's Cup **Winners: 1990‚Äì91 **Runners-up: 1989‚Äì90, 1994‚Äì95, 2004‚Äì05 *Cheshire County League **Winners:1948-49, 1949‚Äì50, 1953‚Äì54 **Runners-up:1950-51, 1978‚Äì79 References External links *Official Witton Albion F.C. website *Witton Albion Supporters Online *Witton F.C. on Football Club History Database *Witton Albion on Football Club History Database Category:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in Cheshire Category:Association football clubs established in 1887 Category:1887 establishments in England Category:Northwich Category:The Combination Category:Lancashire League (football) Category:Lancashire Combination Category:Cheshire County League Category:Northern Premier League clubs Category:National League (English football) ","title":"Witton Albion F.C."},{"id":"3666504","text":"Takydromus sexlineatus, the Asian grass lizard, six-striped long-tailed grass lizard, or long-tailed grass lizard, is an arboreal, diurnal species of lizard. The tail length is usually over three times the body (snout to vent) length in this species. Males and females are similar, males being distinguishable by the presence of pre-anal pores. On average they grow to around snout-to-vent length, with the addition of a distinctive, prehensile long tail.http://www.reptilechannel.com/lizards/lizard-care/grass-lizards.aspx Some individuals may have small circular spots on the sides of the bodies. This species of lizard is often kept as a pet. Like geckos they can drop their tail and grow a new one when attacked. Appearance The long-tailed grass lizard is easily identifiable by a long tail, and has a white to cream coloured underbelly with a brown, green or beige back, often adorned with brown stripes of different shades. It typically has a small head with a sharply pointed snout and black or pink tongue. Its body is slightly elongated and thin with small pointy scales beneath the chin resembling a beard. Males have white spots on their sides, while females do not. Males have tails that thicken past the vent and are generally thicker than the female's down the entire length of the tail. The light stripes on the length of the body are yellower than the female's, which are more cream coloured. They grow up to 12 inches (30 cm.) long, with the tail usually being three times their body length.Purser, Philip A. 2004 The Tiniest Dragon: The Oriental Long-Tailed Grass Lizard Takydromus sexlineatus. Reptilia (GB) (33): 67-71 Distribution From Bogor, West Java Takydromus sexlineatus is found throughout South East Asia, and is native to a number of countries including India, China, Thailand, and Indonesia. The subspecies ocellatus is found in areas such as southern China, north Burma and north Malaysia. Behavior In a pair These are entirely diurnal lizards that emerge in the early morning to bask in the sun. If a potential predator approaches they will first remain completely still, and then if the danger persists, they will flee to the safety of foliage. Both sexes use arm-waving gestures (similar to a front crawl swimming action), apparently to communicate with each other. They are very agile and fast. Diet in captivity Takydromus sexlineatus feeds on small insects such as flies, In captivity they can be reared on crickets and like other small lizards may require a calcium substitute. It is advisable in captivity to vary food including mealworms, sterile maggots or waxworms in addition to crickets although it is possible to feed them garden caught insects. Unlike some larger reptiles, these lizards have extremely fast reactions and have been observed jumping into the air to catch flying prey such as flies. References Further reading * Arnold, E.

The battalion consists of approximately 1000 Marines and sailors and is nicknamed \\"The Beirut Battalion.\\" They fall under the command of the 8th Marine Regiment and the 2nd Marine Division. The unit's history dates back to World War II where they fought in numerous campaigns in the Pacific including Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian and Okinawa. During the Cold War, they were part of Operation Blue Bat in Lebanon in 1958, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing in Lebanon in 1983 where 241 Marines, sailors and soldiers lost their lives that day. In 1991, they saw action during the Gulf War. Since 2001 1/8 has fought the Global War on Terrorism by serving numerous tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Subordinate units * Headquarters and Service Company * Alpha Company * Bravo Company * Charlie Company * Weapons Company History =Activation= Activated April 1, 1940, at San Diego, California, the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines was assigned to the 2nd Marine Brigade. The 2nd Marine Brigade was re- designated February 1, 1941, as 2nd Marine Division. The battalion was assigned during December 1941 to 2nd Marine Brigade, 2nd Marine Division. = World War II = Deployed during January 1942 to American Samoa and detached from the 2nd Marine Division, they participated in the following World War II campaigns:  Guadalcanal campaign  On 4 and 5 November 1942 (D+90) the 8th Marines (1st, 2nd, 3rd BN's) led by Colonel Richard H. Jeschke arrived from American Samoa, landing as reinforcements on Guadalcanal. On 12 January, the Marines began their advance with the 8th Marines along the shore and 2d Marines inland. All along the front of the advancing assault companies the going was rough. The Japanese, remnants of the Sendai Division, were dug into the sides of a series of cross compartments and their fire took the Marines in the flank as they advanced. Progress was slow despite massive artillery support and naval gunfire from four destroyers offshore. In two days of heavy fighting, flamethrowers were employed for the first time and tanks were brought into play. The 2d Marines was now relieved and the 6th Marines moved into the attack along the coast while the 8th Marines took up the advance inland. Naval gunfire support, spotted by naval officers ashore, improved measurably. On the 15th, the Americans, both Army and Marine, reached the initial corps objective. In the Marine attack zone, 600 Japanese were dead. The 8th Marines was essentially pinched out of the front lines by a narrowing attack corridor as the inland mountains and hills pressed closer to the coastal trail. On 31 January, the 2d Marines and the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, boarded ship to leave Guadalcanal. 1st Battalion 8th Marines headed for Wellington, New Zealand. The 8th Marine Regiment losses on Guadalcanal were 115 killed, 451 wounded, and 9 missing.  Battle of Tarawa  1st Battalion 8th Marines departed the , boarded LVT's, and waited at the line of departure. Watching the battle unfold from sea as the division reserve, they were ordered ashore after several hours. Unfortunately, there was quite a bit of confusion and the word didn't reach the commander for some time. After 18 hours out at sea, 1/8 landed on Red Beach 2 at 06:15 on 21 November 1943 (D+1). As soon as 1/8 began their landing, the murderous onslaught started. The LVTs didn't fare any better than the D-Day landings and were quickly bogged down by the reef. The men of 1/8 landed on the far right of Red 2 after wading over 500 yards ashore. In the end, it was the sheer courage of the survivors that got them ashore under such a hellish crossfire. Major Hays reported to Colonel Shoup, the newly promoted commander of the 2nd Marine Regiment, at 08:00 with about half his landing team. 1/8 had suffered more than 300 casualties just trying to get ashore; others were scattered all along the beach and the pier. Worse, the unit had lost all its flamethrowers, demolitions, and heavy weapons. Col. Shoup directed Major Hays to attack westward, but both men knew that small arms and courage alone would not prevail against fortified positions. The Marines of 1/8 fought hard all day. Despite the slow progress, Col. Shoup ended his 16:00 hours message to General Smith with the line, \\"Casualties: many. Percentage dead: unknown. Combat efficiency: We are winning.\\" Col. Edson issued his attack orders for D+1 at 04:00 hours. 1/8, attached to 2nd Marines was to attack at daylight to the west along north beach to eliminate Japanese pockets of resistance between Beaches Red 1 and 2. On Red Beach Two, Major Hays launched his attack promptly at 07:00, attacking westward on a three-company front. Engineers with satchel charges and bangalore torpedoes helped neutralize several inland Japanese positions, but the strongpoints along the re-entrant were still dangerous. Marine light tanks made frontal attacks against the fortifications, even firing their 37mm guns point blank into the embrasures, but they were inadequate for the task. One was lost to enemy fire, and the other two were withdrawn. Hays called for a section of 75mm halftracks. One was lost almost immediately, but the other used its heavier gun to considerable advantage. The center and left flank companies managed to curve around behind the main complexes, effectively cutting the Japanese off from the rest of the island. Along the beach, however, progress was measured in yards. The bright spot of the day for 1/8 came late in the afternoon when a small party of Japanese tried a sortie from the strongpoints against the Marine lines. Hays' men, finally given real targets in the open, cut down the attackers in short order. The toughest fight of the fourth day (D+3) occurred on the Red Beach One/Two border where Colonel Shoup directed the combined forces of Hays' 1/8 and Schoettel's 3/2 against the \\"re-entrant strongpoints. The Japanese defenders in these positions were clearly the most disciplined‚Äîand the deadliest‚Äîon the island. From these bunkers, Japanese antiboat gunners had thoroughly disrupted the landings of four different battalions, and they had very nearly killed General Smith the day before. The seaward approaches to these strongpoints were littered with wrecked LVTs and bloated bodies. Major Hays finally got some flamethrowers (from Crowe's engineers when LT 2/8 was ordered to stand down), and the attack of 1/8 from the east made steady, if painstaking, progress. Major Schoettel, anxious to atone for what some perceived to be a lackluster effort on D-Day, pressed the assault of 3/2 from the west and south. To complete the circle, Shoup ordered a platoon of infantry and a pair of 75mm halftracks out to the reef to keep the defenders pinned down from the lagoon. Some of the Japanese committed hara-kiri; the remainder, exhausted, fought to the end. Hays' Marines had been attacking this complex ever since their landing on the morning of D+1. In those 48 hours, 1/8 fired 54,450 rounds of .30-caliber rifle ammunition. But the real damage was done by the special weapons of the engineers and the direct fire of the halftracks. Capture of the largest position, a concrete pillbox near the beach, enabled easier approaches to the remaining bunkers. By 13:00, it was all over. At the Red 1/Red 2 pocket there was no accurate count of Japanese dead. There were an estimated 1,000 Japanese alive and fighting on the night of D+2, 500 on the morning of D+3 and only 50-100 left when the island was declared secure at 13:30 D+3. 2nd Marine Division suffered 894 killed in action, 48 officers and 846 enlisted men, with another 84 of the survivors later succumbing to their wounds. Following the battle 1/8 along with the 2nd Marine Division was shipped to the big island of Hawaii. 1/8 remained in Hawaii for six months, refitting and training, until called upon for its next major amphibious landing, the Battle of Saipan in the Marianas in June 1944.  Battle of Saipan  1st Battalion 8th Marines landed on Green Beach on 15 June 1944. Confusion on the beaches, particularly in the 2d Marine Division area, was compounded by the strength of a northerly current flow which caused the assault battalions of the 6th and 8th Marines to land about 400 yards too far north. This caused a gap to widen between the 2d and 4th Marine Divisions. On D+1 8th Marines moved east into the swamps around Lake Susupe. On 20 June the 8th Marines wheeled from facing east to attack northward into the foothills leading to Mount Tapotchau. The following day saw the Marines attack all along the line. The 8th Marines worked its painful way into the maze of ridges and gullies that formed the foothills of Mount Tapotchau. On the west side of Saipan, the 2d Marine Division had a memorable day on 25 June. In a series of brilliant tactical maneuvers, with a battalion of the 8th Marines clawing up the eastern slope, a battalion of the 29th Marines (then attached to the 8th Marines) was able to infiltrate around the right flank in single file behind a screen of smoke and gain the dominating peak without the loss of a single man. Over the next several days the 8th Marines encountered four small hills strongly defended by the enemy. Because of their size in comparison with Mount Tapotchau, they were called \\"pimples.\\" Each was named after a battalion commander. Painfully, one by one, they were assaulted and taken over the next few days. Bypassing the town, the 2d Marine Division drove towards Flores Point, halfway to Tanapag. Along the way, with filthy uniforms, stiff with sweat and dirt after over two weeks of fierce fighting, the Marines joyfully dipped their heads and hands into the cool ocean waters. By 4 July 1/8 and the 2nd Division were moved into the reserve force in order to prepare for the attack on Tinian.  Battle of Tinian  At 17:05 on 24 July (Jig Day), 1/8 disembarked the and began landing at White Beach 1 at the request of the 4th Marine Division commander. They were requested at 15:15 hours, but due to communication delays they didn't arrive until the evening. 1/8 was assigned as the 4th Division reserve and ordered to support the 24th Marines, digging in at a place on the line near 2/24. On 25 July (Jig+1), Lieutenant Colonel Hays' 1st Battalion, 8th Marines began the day under control of the 24th Regiment. They received orders to relieve the 1st Battalion, 24th Marines, along the coast on the extreme left flank of the beachhead. This shift was accomplished at 09:20, almost the same moment that Hays' unit reverted to its parent regiment, the newly landed 8th Marines. The latter, now attached to the 4th Division, assumed the northernmost sector of the front with 2 medium and 2 light (flamethrower) tanks from the 2nd Tank Battalion attached. 8th Regiment then began to struggle northward toward Ushi Point. Using the same tactics employed along the beach by the 24th Marines on Jig-Day, 1/8 supported by armored amphibians afloat and tanks ashore, inched slowly through the gnarled coastal terrain and snare-like undergrowth. Marines found the zone littered with bodies‚ÄîJapanese counterattackers of the night before that required careful examination for suicidal survivors. At first there was no opposition, but as the unit pressed farther to the north resistance began to develop along the coast. There, survivors of the counterattack, holed up in the craggy coral, fired occasional challenging bursts at the Marines. By 11:15 the advance had bogged to a virtual standstill in the face of an especially knotty core of opposition near the water's edge. The rugged terrain around the strong-point forbade effective use of supporting tanks, and the armored amphibians, because of the shore's configuration, could not hit the area. To relieve the deadlock, Lieutenant Colonel Hays ordered his battalion to pivot on the left and wheel in an arc to the beach. This maneuver, striking the enemy at right angles to the original direction of advance, was successful. Within 15 minutes a pocket of 20 to 25 well-concealed riflemen had been reduced. As the 8th Marines advanced, their front expanded, and at 11:30 the commander, Colonel Wallace, ordered his 2d Battalion up on the 1st Battalion's right to attack eastward. This zone included the built-up area around Ushi Point Airfield as well as the strip itself. Since most of the Japanese troops originally assigned to this area had expended themselves against the 1st Battalion, 24th Marines, on the night of Jig-Day, they could oppose this attack only with occasional, ineffective small-arms fire. The advance swept rapidly through the area. The 1st Battalion, too, gained momentum after destroying the beach strong-point and pushed northeastward along the coast. By dark the 8th Marines, having pushed about 200 yards past Objective O-2, stopped and carefully tied in lines for the night. At 06:30 on 26 July (Jig+2), 1/8 along with the 8th Regiment were ordered back to 2nd Marine Division Control in order to facilitate the day's attack. With the 8th Marines on the left, the 2nd Marine Division began pushing eastward. 8th Marines swept rapidly across the Ushi Point flats. The airfield had been abandoned, but the Marines carefully searched each position to make certain that none of the enemy were lying in wait. By noon Colonel Wallace, the 8th Marines' commander, reported his assault battalions (1st and 2nd BN) on the east coast. 8th Regiment, now designated division reserve, began searching for enemy stragglers west of Objective O-3. 2nd Division's successful 2,500-yard push to the east coast now made it possible for the landing force to attack in a single direction, south. 1/8 and the 8th Regiment remained the division reserve until 31 July. The night of 31 July - 1 August turned out to be the busiest of 1/8 and the 8th Regiment. The entire division's success depended on the 8th Marines success of reaching the heights of Objective O-8A. The going was tough due to the steep climb, but by the afternoon a platoon from A Company followed by a platoon from C Company 1/8 made a breakthrough and reached the summit. That night the Japanese launched a vicious local counterattack against 1/8's left. The situation was touch and go for a short time, one section of the Marines' front was even forced back a few yards, but the attackers were too few for the task they had assumed, and the Marines overcame the assault. Japanese counterattacks continued throughout the night, probing at 1/8's gaps in the line. They solved the issue by stringing concertina wire between foxholes. At 14:55 on 1 August, 8th Marines reached their final objective with only sporadic resistance. 1/8 was then assigned the lion's share of mop up operations. On 6 August the 8th Marines assumed responsibility for the entire 2d Division sector and continued mopping-up activities. The next day the regiment also took over the 4th Division area, relieving the 23d Marines, which had patrolled that sector since 4 August. At noon, 10 August, the 8th Marines became part of the Tinian Island Command, but the mop-up operations continued. On 25 October 8th Marines left 1st Battalion 8th Marines on Tinian and moved back to Saipan. After five months' garrison duty, 1/8 left Tinian and moved back to Saipan on 1 January 1945. For the 8th Marine Regiment securing Tinian came at a cost of 36 KIA and 294 WIA, the highest casualties of the five regiments assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. Tinian had a strategic significance not fully apparent to the Marines who captured it in July 1944: slightly over a year later, 6 August 1945, the island provided the Army Air Forces a site from which the B-29 Enola Gay carried out the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. From the same field three days later another B-29 carried a second bomb, which was dropped on Nagasaki.  Battle of Okinawa  The 2nd Marine Division (including 1/8) remained as an amphibious reserve from 1‚Äì10 April 1945, when it was sent back to Saipan to minimize casualties from Kamikaze attacks off the coast of Okinawa. In late May, the 8th Marines of the 2nd Marine Division finally got a meaningful role in the closing weeks of the Okinawa campaign. Colonel Clarence R. Wallace and his 8th Marines, with Lt. Col Richard W. Hayward leading 1/8, arrived from Saipan, and were committed to the campaign. Between 3‚Äì9 June, 1/8 and the 8th Marines conducted amphibious landings to capture two outlying islands, Iheya Shima and Aguni Shima. The purpose of the mission was to provide more early warning radar sites against the kamikazes devastating the naval fleet offshore. No enemy contact was made on the operation. Following the missions at Iheya Shima and Aguni Shima, General Roy Geiger assigned the 8th Marines, 1/8 included, to the 1st Marine Division, and by 18 June they had relieved the 7th Marines and were sweeping southeastward for the final overland assaults in the south. Army Lt. General Simon Buckner, commander of the Okinawa operation, took an interest in observing the 8th Marines as this was their first time in action on Okinawa since the regiment entered the lines in the drive to the south. Buckner went to a forward observation post on 18 June, watching the 8th Marines advance along the valley floor. Japanese gunners on the opposite ridge saw the official party and opened up. Shells struck the nearby coral outcrop, driving a lethal splinter into the general's chest. He died in 10 minutes, one of the few senior U.S. officers to be killed in action throughout World War II. Marine General Geiger took over, declaring organized resistance on the island over on 21 June. The first battalion 8th Marine regiment suffered its last combat death of World War II the next day on 22 June 1945. 1/8 and the 8th Marines, attached to the 1st Marine Division, received the Presidential Unit Citation for their part in the Okinawa campaign. They would return to Saipan, until called upon for occupation duty in Japan  Occupation of Japan  1/8 deployed during September 1945 to Nagasaki, Japan, and participated in the occupation of Japan from September 1945 ‚Äì June 1946. By 18 October, all units of the 8th Marines had established themselves in and around Kumamoto and begun the by-now familiar process of inventory and disposition. On 29 October, a motor convoy carrying the major part of 1/8 moved from Kumamoto to Kagoshima city to assume control of western Kagoshima. The battalion had to start anew the routine of reconnaissance, inspection, inventory, and disposition that had occupied it twice before. By early 1946, 2nd Marine Division began taking over areas once occupied by soon to be deactivated Army units; 8th Marines were moved to Kumamoto and Kagoshima. They relocated during June‚ÄìJuly 1946 to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and were deactivated November 18, 1947. = Reactivation = The battalion was reactivated November 1, 1950, at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, as the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines and assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. It deployed to the Mediterranean and the Caribbean at various times from the 1950s through the 1990s. = 1958 Lebanon crisis = BLT 1/8 had already been deployed to the Mediterranean since 9 January and was due to rotate back to the U.S., but due to the unrest in Lebanon their deployment was extended. At 09:00, 18 July, the third battalion (2/2 and 3/6 being the first two) of the 2d Provisional Marine Force, BLT 1/8 under Lieutenant Colonel John H. Brickley, landed at Yellow Beach, four miles north of Beirut, where they remained and reinforced their positions. On 21 July 1958, BLT 1/8 received permission to begin motorized patrols. The patrols reconnoitered up to 20 miles east of the position of 1/8 north of the city. The biggest medical problem confronting the Marines in Lebanon was the outbreak of dysentery. During the period 18‚Äì31 July, BLT 1/8 alone suffered 48 cases. On 14 August 1/8 took over 2/2's former position where is remained until leaving in September. = Cuban Missile Crisis = On 20 October 1962, 1/8 received orders to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. On 22 October 1962, 1st Battalion 8th Marines arrived in echelon at Naval Air Station, Guantanamo Bay. The line companies went into defensive positions at Leeward Point, except Company B, which took up a position on the Windward Side. 1/8's mission was the defense of the airfield until relieved. On 18 November 1962, President Kennedy lifted the naval blockade of Cuba. By 6 December 1962 it was announced that 1/8 would be airlifted to Cherry Point, NC by 12 December 1962. Company A (Rein) remained at Leeward Point until about 7 January 1963. 1/8 suffered two casualties (WIA) due to a friendly fire incident on 7 November while a sentry was investigating a telephone silence at Outpost Sneezy. = Dominican Republic = By 2 May 1965, 1st Battalion, 8th Marines had been designated as the airlift alert battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Edward F Danowitz. The first increment departed shortly after midnight onboard C-130s for San Isidro Air Base. The leading elements of the battalion, consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Danowitz and Company D, touched down at the airfield at 05:20 on 3 May 1965. By 21:00 the entire battalion was in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. On 4 May 1965, upon orders from RLT-6, the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines was transported by helicopters from San Isidro into LZ-4 where it established its Command Post in the Belle Vista Golf House located next to the Embajador Hotel. For the next three days the battalion's and attached units' vehicles moved through the newly opened LOC with all the landing teams equipment and supplies. The battalion was directed to provide security in its area of responsibility around the golf course and to provide one officer and 60 enlisted men for the security of the beach supply area (Red Beach) at Haina. The 3rd Battalion 6th Marines was relieved by 1st Battalion 8th Marines on 10 May 1965. After moving into its new positions, 1/8 was directed to straighten the eastern boundary along Phase line CAIRO. The battalion also assumed the responsibility for providing security to the American Embassy. The final withdrawal of Marine units began on 2 June 1965. The 1st Battalion 8th Marines was relieved in place by the U.S. Army's 1st Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry. 1/8 embarked on board the and the ship departed the area for Morehead City, North Carolina, arriving on 6 June. 1/8 suffered 4 Marines wounded in action (WIA) during the campaign. =Multinational Force in Lebanon= The battalion participated as part of the multinational peace keeping force in Lebanon, May ‚Äì November 1983. On Sunday morning at 06:22, October 23, 1983, Battalion Landing Team 1/8, the ground combat element of the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit, was the main victim of what came to be known as the Beirut barracks bombing when a truck loaded with 12,000 pounds of explosives crashed through the gates of the BLT headquarters at the airport in Beirut, Lebanon. Casualties that day were 220 Marines, 18 sailors, and 3 soldiers killed with an additional 100 injured. The majority of these casualties were from 1/8. =Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm= The battalion participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm in Southwest Asia during December 1990 through April 1991. In December 1990 1/8 deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield where they remained until Operation Desert Storm began in February 1991. On 24 February 1991 (G Day) at 06:15 1st Battalion 8th Marines, which was designated as one of three assault battalions leading the way for the 2nd Marine Division, reported to be at the edge of the obstacle belt in lanes Green 5 and 6. The enemy's defensive belts consisted of the two minefields and the wire obstacles noted in earlier intelligence reports. The Green lanes, carrying 1/8 were not as quickly cleared as the Red and Blue lanes. Several of the engineer vehicles had struck mines and been put out of action. Line charges had caught on overhead power lines, or had failed to detonate. On the right flank, the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, was encountering Iraqi troops in positions between the two minefields. Company A had the mission of guarding the battalion's flank in this area; accordingly, the 3d Platoon was ordered to secure a building, surrounded by a chain-link fence, located 800 meters to the east. The platoon was mounted in assault amphibious vehicles. As they came within 300 meters of the building, Iraqi soldiers inside it opened fire with rocket- propelled grenades. The platoon dismounted, and under cover of the vehicles' .50-caliber machine guns, attacked through volleys of grenades. Within 100 meters of the building the platoon was pinned down by automatic weapons fire. The 3d Squad was ordered to attack the building while the rest of the platoon laid down covering fires. In open view of the Iraqis and under fire, Sergeant William J. Warren, leader of the 3d Squad, stood up and moved among his fire teams, giving orders and encouraging his men. He maneuvered his teams to within 20 meters of the building, and then led an assault through a hole in the fence. As the squad entered the building, the shaken Iraqi troops fled from it, seeking escape across the desert. By 10:20 that morning, all three assault battalions (1/6, 1/8, and 2/2) of the 2nd Marine Division were reporting that they were in contact with the enemy. On the right 1/8 was still coming through the breach on lanes Green 5 and 6. It then moved into an Iraqi brigade-size position in which it destroyed a large number of tanks and APCs. By nightfall of the first day of the ground war 1/8 had met General Key's intent and successfully moved through the breaches. On 25 February 1991 (G+1) at 06:20 the \\"Reveille Counterattack\\" began. Apparently maneuvering to hit the regiment's logistics trains, a battalion-sized Iraqi unit of tanks and mechanized infantry collided with 1st Battalion 8th Marines. Fighting back with its own attached tanks and air support, the battalion accounted for 39 Iraqi tank and APC \\"kills\\". In the crucial first minutes of this attack, Sergeant Scott A. Dotson led his vehicle-mounted TOW section up to positions from which it could most effectively engage the enemy armor. Although under heavy fire itself, within minutes this section had destroyed eight Iraqi tanks. This attack may have been a part of a brigade-sized counterattack; its disruption caused die hard enemy survivors to move into prepared positions, where they would be encountered the next day. As the 8th Marines (1/8, 2/4, and 3/23) came up into position on the right flank of the 2nd Marine Division's zone, certain adjustments had to be made. 1/8 was returned to the operational control of its parent regiment by nightfall; since it was already in the 8th Marines' zone, no movement was required. During the morning attack, the 1st Battalion 8th Marines was moving forward as the division's easternmost battalion. The third day of the ground war, 26 February 1991 (G+2), also began with an antitank engagement. Throughout the morning, all division elements were reporting the movements of, and engagements with, enemy formations. However, 1st Battalion 8th Marines, was to be the focus of the enemy's attention once again. The battalion had arrived along Phase Line Horse the previous evening (25 February), and was the right flank battalion of the entire 2nd Marine Division. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Bruce A. Gombar, had positioned his battalion into an L-shaped defensive position for the night, in order to secure this eastern flank. The unit was set along two roads, the main north‚Äìsouth road leading from Kuwait City, and an east‚Äìwest road intersecting with it just above the area of the \\"ice-cube.\\" Company A was on the battalion's right, facing east, and supported by a combined anti-armor team. In the center was the tank company attached to the battalion, Company B of the 4th Tank Battalion, which was set in along the intersection of the two roads. On the left was Company C, 1/8 also supported by an antiarmor team from weapons platoons, supplemented by attached antitank TOW unit. At 02:30 1/8 was struck by a two-pronged attack of APCs and dismounted infantry coming from the northeast and northwest. The attack hit the road intersection held by the tank company and the boundary between 1/8 and 2/4 which was set in at the \\"ice-cube.\\" The battalion's eastern flank also received some accurate artillery fire, causing five casualties. The battalion's tanks and CAT Platoon worked very effectively at beating back this attack. They destroyed several enemy armored vehicles, some of them within only 75 meters of the battle positions. Pushing through to the final objectives, 1/8 was placed on the division's extreme right, tied in with the 1st Battalion 5th Marines of the 1st Marine Division. The battalion aimed at two small hills, from which it could control the road, as its objectives. Near to these was a suspected Iraqi strongpoint in an agricultural area known as the \\"Dairy Farm.\\" Artillery fired preparation missions on this area as the companies began their final assaults on their objectives. In gathering darkness the battalion's progress slowed as it entered the increasingly restrictive nature of a more urban area. By 18:00 on 26 February, 1/8 had secured its section of the road and established anti-tank ambushes along it. In its movement north the 1st Battalion 8th Marines bypassed some Iraqi formations. With Al Jahrah secured by nightfall and Arab forces bypassing the division on 27 February 1991, the day's action would be the last of the war. During the war the following units were attached to 1/8: Company B, 4th Tank Battalion; Company C, 2d Combat Engineer Battalion; Company D, 2d Assault Amphibian Battalion. By mid-March 1/8 was preparing to move back to Saudi Arabia, and by April they were preparing for redeployment back to Camp Lejeune, NC. The cost to the 2nd Marine Division was six killed in action, and 38 wounded. There were also three non-battle deaths and 36 non-battle wounded. =Subsequent Operations (1991-2001)= *From September 1993 - March 1994, BLT 1/8 participated in support of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia (November 1993), Southwest Asia \\"Cease Fire\\" Campaign on board the USS Guadalcanal in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (17 Oct 1993 - 10 Nov 1993), and supported Operation Provide Promise and Operation Deny Flight in Bosnia (September - October 1993 and January 1994). *Elements of 1/8 participated in support of Operation Support Democracy, Caribbean Area, May ‚Äì July 1994. *Elements of 1/8 participated in Operation Sea Signal in Cuba, June - July 1994. *In March - April 1997, 1st Battalion 8th Marines conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO) of Americans and Allies from the embassy in Tirana, Albania during Operation Silver Wake. *Just as Operation Silver Wake wrapped up the Marines of Headquarters & Service Company, Alpha Company, Bravo Company, and Weapons Company were sent off the Coast of Zaire/Congo for Operation Guardian Retrieval. *Deploying in October 2000, as the BLT of the 22nd MEU, elements of 1/8 deployed to Kosovo and Croatia as part of Operation Joint Guardian. BLT 1/8 and the 22nd MEU returned home in May 2001. =Global War on Terrorism and additional operations (2001-present)=  Iraq War  *April‚ÄìMay 2003 On 5 March 2003 Battalion Landing Team (BLT) 1/8 departed Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) on board the USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7), USS Nashville (LPD-13), and USS Carter-Hall (LSD-50). The 26th MEU sailed directly to the eastern Mediterranean Sea in order to prepare for the potential invasion of Iraq. Following the Turkish government's denial of the usage of their country for a northern invasion, BLT 1/8 was forced to deploy from Crete and fly nearly 1,100 miles via U.S. Marine C-130 transport aircraft and 440 miles from the far Eastern Mediterranean Sea via CH-53 and CH-46 helicopters into Northern Iraq. On 12 April, the battalion began combat operations in Irbil and Mosul, Iraq as part of Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force - North (TF - Viking) for Operation Iraqi Freedom. During combat operations in Iraq, 1/8 suffered 1 Marine wounded in action (WIA) on 21 April 2003 from Weapons Company 81mm Mortar Platoon during a night-time probing attack on the Mosul Airport. By 1 May 2003, the battalion was relieved by the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division. The battalion withdrew from Mosul, Iraq and returned to the Iwo Jima ARG waiting in the Mediterranean Sea. *June 2004-January 2005 The battalion deployed in June 2004 to Iraq as a part of Regimental Combat Team 1 and later RCT-7, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced). From June 2004 to January 2005, 1/8 conducted combat operations in Al Anbar Province in Area of Operations (AO) Denver and later AO Raleigh, including operations in Rawa, Anah, Little Anah, Haditha, Baghdadi, Barwana, Abu Buyatt, ASP Wolf, Hit, Al Asad, Haqlanyih, Karmah, Naser Wa Saleem, Abu Ghuraib, and Fallujah. U.S. Marines prepare to step off on a patrol through the city of Fallujah, Iraq, to clear the city of insurgent activity and weapons caches as part of Operation al Fajr (New Dawn) on Nov. 26, 2004.1st Battalion 8th Marines was one of the lead battalions during Operation Phantom Fury from 8 November to 9 December 2004 leading the assault into Fallujah. During combat operations in Iraq from June 2004-January 2005, 1st Battalion 8th Marines (Reinforced) suffered 21 Marines killed in action (KIA) and nearly 150 Marines wounded in action (WIA) with 17 KIA's and 102 WIA's coming in three weeks in Fallujah in November 2004. 1/8 conducted a relief in place with their sister battalion 3/8 and returned to Camp Lejeune by 1 February 2005. Two Marines attempting to recover a fellow wounded 1/8 Marine. During Operation Phantom Fury, November 2004. *August‚ÄìNovember 2006 From 6 June - 6 December 2006, 1/8 was the Battalion Landing Team of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Various elements of 1/8 conducted combat operations in Iraq. One Marine from 1/8 Scout Sniper Platoon was killed in action and several other 1/8 Marines and a Corpsman were wounded on 1 November 2006, while conducting operations in Haditha, Iraq. *September 2007 ‚Äì April 2008 In September 2007, the battalion deployed a fourth time to Ar-Ramadi in Al Anbar Province in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Battalion suffered one Marine killed in action and numerous others wounded during combat operations. The battalion was instrumental in denying the enemy freedom of movement and as a result violence in the war ravaged city declined. *March‚ÄìSeptember 2009 In 2009, 1/8 returned to Iraq for its fifth and final rotation to Al-Taqaddum in Al Anbar Province in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In June, the battalion lost a Marine due to a non-hostile incident. AFGHANISTAN CAMPAIGN *August 2010‚ÄìMarch 2011 In August 2010, 1st Battalion, 8th Marines deployed to Musa'Qaleh and Now Zad, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom 10-2, Regimental Combat Team 2, First Marine Division (Forward), I Marine Expeditionary Force (Forward) Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force. The unit's performance in counter-insurgency operations in the two districts were integral in the stabilization of the region and development of Afghan National Security Forces. 1/8 suffered the loss of five Marines and one Navy Hospital Corpsman that were killed in action and numerous others wounded in action during their deployment to Helmand Province. *January 2012-August 2012 From January to August 2012, 1st Battalion, 8th Marines deployed to Afghanistan again to conduct counter- insurgency operations in Northern Helmand Province. 1/8 suffered three Marines and one Navy Hospital Corpsman killed in action during their second deployment to Helmand Province. Marines take a look at their targets following marksmanship training ADDITIONAL OPERATIONS HORN OF AFRICA *June‚ÄìJuly 2003 After leaving Mosul in May 2003, 1/8 took part in a training exercises in Albania, received port calls to Crete, Malta, and Italy, and conducted training and counter-terrorism operations in Djibouti, as well as remaining in the Persian Gulf on board ship as a reserve force for the U.S. Central Command. While in the Persian Gulf, the MEU received a port call to the United Arab Emerites. LIBERIA *July‚ÄìSeptember 2003 As the situation began to rapidly deteriorate, 1/8 and the 26th MEU were ordered to Liberia. The MEU left the coast of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa, sailed back through the Suez Canal and took up a position off the coast of the west African nation. In an impressive show of force, the U.S.S. Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group sailed in-line roughly 3 miles off the coast of Liberia. On 14 August 2003, elements of the battalion eventually inserted into Roberts International Airport and at the Freeport of Monrovia on Bushrod Island outside of Monrovia, Liberia as part of Operation Sheltering Sky. A rifle company from 1/8 and supporting units from the 26th MEU conducted airfield security operations as part of Joint Task Force Liberia in an effort to facilitate the transition of governmental operations from the regime of Charles Taylor to a democratically elected government.

It is also called Sun Gohoro (in Nepali). It is also known as SANGOIH (‡§∏‡§®‡§ó‡•ã‡§π‡§ø) in Maithili and Svarna Godhika (‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶£‡¶ó‡ßã‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ) in Bengali. Description Varanus flavescens has subcorneal teeth, scarcely compressed. Its snout is short and convex, measuring a little less than the distance from the anterior border of the orbit to the anterior border of the ear; canthus rostralis distinct. Its nostril an oblique slit, a little nearer to the end of the snout than to the orbit. Digits short, the length of the fourth toe, measured from its articulation with the tarsus to the base of the claw, not exceeding the length of the femur. The tail of the yellow monitor feebly compressed, keeled above. Scales of head small, subequal; the median series of supraocular scales slightly dilated transversely. Scales on upper surfaces moderate, oval, keeled. Abdominal scales smooth, in 65 to 75 transverse rows. Caudal scales keeled; the caudal keel with a very low, doubly toothed crest. Olive or yellowish brown above, with irregular darker markings which are generally confluent into broad cross bars; a blackish temporal streak; lower surfaces yellowish, with rather indistinct brown cross bars, which are most distinct on the throat. Young dark brown above, with yellow spots confluent into crossbars; lower surface yellow, with dark brown cross bars.Boulenger, G. A. 1890. Fauna of British India. Reptilia and Batrachia. golden monitor lizard in the bush, seen tarai region of Nepal Population The actual population or population trends is unknown. However, it is considered that the species has low population density even in its preferred habitat. Limited studies suggest that the species is decreasing, however more studies required to confirm actual trend of the species.Ghimire, H. R. (2012). Distribution and Conservation Status of Yellow Monitor, Varanus flavescens (Hardwicke and Gray, 1827) in Parasan VDC of Kanchanpur District, M.Sc. thesis, Central Department of Environmental Science, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Habitat and ecology The species prefers wet areas, found to be edge of forest and near to human settlements that increase its threat from direct killing. It looks like V. flavescens tolerate the habitat modification of some degree for agriculture as it was also found on agricultural land. They are not habitat specialist group, but generally less found on forest with large trees, dry areas. It is a carnivorous lizard, and less adapted to climb on trees due to its short hind toes. They separate the habitat with sympatric V. bengalensis, as former prefers wet areas with high ground cover and later prefers the areas with large trees. A medium-sized monitor, it measures from snout to vent 448 mm; 952 mm including the tail and weight up to 1450 gm. Distribution Flood plains of the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.Monitor-lizards.net Threat Previously international trade was a major threat to the species, but the current status of the trade is unknown. However, the local and national trade creates a threat to the species (in Nepal). Direct killing is the major threat to the species. Lack of knowledge about the species among local people is the cause of most of the killing, most of the killing is related to use and trade of the skin. Ignorance is a root issue, no campaign to spread awareness or education of the local people is being conducted. Creation of Protected areas is insufficient for the species as most of potential habitat lies outside the protected areas and it is often found near to human settlement; this increases the threat to the species. Conservation The yellow monitor Varanus flavescens is protected in all range countries except Bhutan; Nepal, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. As data is inadequate for the species, research for its distribution, population status, trend, ecology and threats are urgent. The countries should enforce the legal measure to stop the local trade and killing of the species. As there is low awareness among people about its importance and legal status, they should be made aware about it. Notes References * Auffenberg W. Rahman H. Iffat F.

Three subspecies have been described:Mertens, R, \\"√úber die Rassen des W√ºstenwarans (Varanus griseus)\\", Senckenb. Biol. 1954, 35, 353-357 * V. g. griseus (grey monitor) * V. g. caspius (Caspian monitor) * V. g. koniecznyi (Indian desert monitor) The desert monitor is carnivorous, feeding on a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates.Bennett, D. ‚Äò‚ÄôDesert Monitor, Grey Monitor‚Äô‚Äô, A Little Book of Monitor Lizards, Viper Press, 1995 Description =Body features= Varanus griseus monitor lizards normally display a variety of body coloration from light brown and yellow to grey. They average about one meter in length, but can reach total body lengths of almost two meters. These lizards can also have horizontal bands on either their backs or tails, along with yellow spots across their backs. Their young are normally a brightly colored orange and have distinctive bands across their backs which may be lost as they mature. Their nostrils are slits located farther back on their snouts (closer to the eyes than the nose), and their overall body size is dependent on the available food supply, the time of year, environmental climate, and reproductive state. Males are generally larger and more robust than females, but females have a more gentle look about them. Those differences allow males to be distinguished from females from a distance without careful inspection. Adult monitor lizards also go through periods of molting in which they shed their outer layer of skin to expand their overall body size. This process can take several months and happens around three times per year. Their skin is adapted to the desert environment where they live, and they are excellent swimmers and divers and have been known to enter the water occasionally to hunt for food.Pianka, Eric R., Dennis King, and Ruth Allen. King. Varanoid Lizards of the World. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2004. Print. =Subspecies= Varanus griseus griseus The V. g. griseus subspecies (grey monitor) has five to eight narrow grey bands on its back, as well as 19-28 bands on its tail. Its tail is more rounded that those of the other subspecies, and the final size of the adult depends on which habitat they are living. Their coloration can be from simple grey (in desert-like ecosystems) to brilliantly colored (in areas with large amounts of plant growth). Their most common prey is lizards and snakes, but can also include ground-nesting birds and other small mammals. Varanus griseus caspius The V. g. caspius subspecies (Caspian monitor) has five to eight bands on its back, 13-19 bands on its tail, a plain tail tip, and about 143 rows of scales in the middle section of its body. It has the largest body of the three subspecies, and is considered to be in danger of becoming extinct. They are found in mainly sandy or clay environments, although sporadically in sparsely woodland areas. Their diets include tortoises and their eggs, small mammals, and adult cobras and vipers. They are strong diggers and can easily build burrows that are several feet long. Varanus griseus koniecznyi The V. g. koniecznyi subspecies (Indian desert monitor) has three to five bands on its back, 13-19 bands on its tail, a plain tail tip, 108-139 rows of scales on its midsection, and a broader and flatter head when compared to the other subspecies. It is mainly found in Pakistan and India, and has the smallest body of the three subspecies. They have been reported to possibly not go through the normal hibernation period over the winter, but are still inactive and do not feed between December and March. Their normal diets consist mainly of invertebrates, but can also branch out to other lizards and small mammals. =Lifestyle= V. griseus goes into hibernation from about September to April. In April is a mass exodus from their hibernation, and they become most active between May and July. During the middle of the day, the lizards mainly stay in their burrows and only come to the desert surface to search for food. The monitor lizards require approximately 3 to 4 full hibernation periods (years) to reach their full size (about 55‚Äì65 cm excluding their tails) and at least 3 hibernation periods before they become sexually mature. The overall lifespan of V. griseus in the wild does not normally exceed around 8 years in both males and females.Smirina, E.M., and Tsellarius, A. Yu. Aging, Longevity, and Growth of the Desert Monitor Lizard, Russian Journal of Herpetology, Vol. 3 No. 2, pp. 130-142, 1996 Importance of body temperature V. griseus is a cold-blooded ectotherm whose behaviors therefore depend on the outside temperatures. Many lizards become sluggish in cold weather and even may become inactive if the temperature decreases substantially. Their olfactory and nerve signals significantly slow down, which severely limit the lizard from either catching potential prey or escaping from predators. The body temperature of V. griseus is directly proportional to its running speed between the temperatures of 21 and 37 ¬∞C. Between those temperatures, the running speed of the monitor lizard increases from a little over 1 m/s at 21 ¬∞C to around 3 m/s at 37 ¬∞C. Over 37 ¬∞C, its running speed does not increase, and below 21 ¬∞C, the lizards are extremely sluggish. If they are being pursued by a predator while their body temperature is less than 21 ¬∞C, they will not flee, but will instead hold their ground and become extremely aggressive. The body temperature of V. griseus depends mainly on the outside environment (time of day, season, etc.). Their internal temperatures begin warming up before they even leave their burrows through conductive heat gain, and their temperatures rapidly rise once they begin basking in the morning sun and reach their highest point in the noonday heat. The specific body temperature of V. griseus can vary depending on the average temperatures of the country they live in, but their maximum body temperature does not usually exceed 38.5 ¬∞C even when basking in the sunlight. Male monitor lizards are generally more active and have a higher average body temperature than the females. The body temperature of the lizard during hibernation is 15.0 to 30.5 ¬∞C, but in many areas, the average body temperature during hibernation is around 16-18 ¬∞C.Ibrahim, Adel A. A radiotelemetric study of the body temperature of Varanus griseus in Zaranik Protected Area, North Sinai, Egypt, Egyptian Journal of Biology, Vol. 2, pp.57-66, 2000 =Reproduction= Desert monitor reproduction normally takes place between May and July. Copulation occurs in May and June, and the lizards normally lay their eggs from the latter part of June through the beginning of July. The eggs are incubated at temperatures from 29 to 31 ¬∞C, and hatch after an average of 120 days. At birth, the baby lizards have a total length of around 25 cm.Varanus griseus (Daudin 1803) Desert Monitor\\" =Feeding, hunting, and diet= Like most members of the genus Varanus, V. griseus is a carnivore. The preferred prey of the species is mice, eggs, or fish, but it will also prey on smaller mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, or other invertebrates, if the opportunity presents itself.Arbuckle, Kevin. Ecological Function of Venom in Varanus, with a Compilation of Dietary Records from the Literature, Biowak, Vol. 3(2), pp. 46-56, 2009 Venom The possibility of venom in the genus Varanus is widely debated. Previously, venom was thought to be unique to Serpentes (snakes) and Heloderma (venomous lizards). The aftereffects of a Varanus bite were thought to be due to oral bacteria alone, but recent studies have shown venom glands are more likely in the mouths of several, if not all of the species. V. griseus has not yet been specifically tested, but its bites have shown aftereffects consistent with the venomous bites from other varanid lizards. The venom can be used as a defensive mechanism to fend off predators, to help digest food, to sustain oral hygiene, and possibly to help in capturing and killing prey. Conservation V. griseus is not threatened in much of its habitat, although a great deal of the land previously inhabited by the subspecies V. g. caspius has been turned into farmland, which puts pressure on the species. Around 17,000 skins of this lizard are involved in commercial trade every year. While trading the skins internationally is prohibited by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), in northern Africa, central Asia, and parts of India, the species is unprotected from hunting laws and is still hunted commercially.Gale Group. ‚Äò‚ÄôDesert Monitor‚Äô‚Äô , 2001 =Captivity= These lizards rarely do well and, at most, live only a few years in captivity. On occasion, when their living requirements can be specifically met, they have been documented to live for more than 17 years, although they never become docile, and never become accustomed to being handled. In captivity, their environments should mirror those of many ground-dwelling animals, as well as their natural desert habitat. They require lower temperatures to hibernate during the winter, along with warmer temperatures during the summer months, and their diets in captivity should be similar to their diets in the wild.

Newman Arboretum in the Botanic Gardens The Cornell Botanic Gardens, formerly known as the Cornell Plantations, is a botanical garden located adjacent to the Cornell University campus in Ithaca, New York. The Botanic Gardens proper consist of of botanical gardens and of the F.R. Newman Arboretum. The greater Botanic Gardens includes 40 different nature areas around Cornell and Ithaca, covering . The origin of the Botanic Gardens dates back to Cornell's beginning in the mid-19th century and are part of the university's longtime interest in agriculture, forestry, and the natural sciences. The Botanic Gardens saw a major planting effort during the 1930s and assumed the name Cornell Plantations in 1944. Gardens and facilities have continually expanded, including a construction program at the start of the 21st century. The Botanic Gardens also maintains four gardens on Cornell's central campus. The Botanic Gardens offers three courses for academic credit, are used as a resource by other classes, host a number of informal lectures and tours, and have played a part in many scholarly papers. , the Botanic Gardens had a $2.9 million annual operating budget. The name was changed to the current form in 2016. The gardens specialize in trees and shrubs native to New York State. The themed herb garden is especially noted. The Botanic Gardens have been the subject of several books and films over the years, are open daily without charge, and have been recommended as a visitation site by a number of travel books and newspaper travel sections. History One of the ponds at the Cornell Botanic Gardens Prior to the founding of Cornell University, Ezra Cornell had a large farm on the East Hill above Ithaca, New York. As part of locating New York State's land-grant college in Ithaca, Cornell offered to donate the farm for use as a campus. In 1862, Cornell's first president, Andrew Dickson White, wrote a colleague that a great university should include a botanical garden: ‚ÄúIt must have the best of Libraries ‚Äì collections in different departments ‚Äì Laboratory ‚Äì Observatory ‚Äì Botanical Garden perhaps‚Ä¶‚Äù At the university's opening ceremony in 1868, Louis Agassiz, an internationally known naturalist, remarked that no other area could compete with Cornell's surroundings in the opportunities offered for the study of natural history. From its inception, Cornell formed a reputation for creative means of research into the natural sciences, including the establishment of the pioneering College of Agriculture. When the university built its first women's dormitory in 1875, it included a conservatory for growing plants and a specimen tree collection. Separately, the College of Veterinary Medicine started a specialized garden of plants that are poisonous to livestock. Cornell's farm included two deep gorges which flanked both sides of the early campus, and as the campus developed the gorges remained undeveloped and filled with native plants and wildlife. These became the start of the on-campus gardens and arboretum. A goal of creating an explicit arboretum was proposed in various university reports to trustees and other publications in 1877, 1883, 1908, and 1914. Houston Pond at the Arboretum; nearby is a site for events Cornell's acquisition of off-campus forest land dates to 1898 and the founding of the New York State College of Forestry, which was the first forestry college in North America. As a part of establishing that school, Cornell acquired a demonstration forest near Saranac Lake in the Adirondack Mountains. The harvesting of trees from that forest drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners. Although political opposition caused Cornell to transfer the forest lands under the \\"forever wild\\" protection of the Adirondack Forest Preserve and to transfer Cornell's forestry education programs to its College of Agriculture, Cornell continued to acquire forest land remote from its main campus. In 1935, the decision to create an arboretum was finally made and the university established the Arboretum as a separate department. From 1935 to 1940, the federal government's Civilian Conservation Corps Camp SP 48 devoted 170 to 200 workers to planting trees, constructing dikes, and building trails in order to develop the Arboretum. In 1944, Liberty Hyde Bailey, the Dean emeritus of the College of Agriculture and a horticulturalist highly regarded around the world, proposed the name Cornell Plantations for an expanded department in a report that reflected the work of a number of botany and horticulture professors. By 1948, the Plantations numbered and the first Director was named, John F. Cornman. During a 1949 broadcast on widely heard radio station WGY, Cornell emeritus professor Bristow Adams reflected upon the now five-year-old Plantations, and stated that the relationship between humans and things that grow were of utmost importance and that gardens, forests, and parks were everlasting collections that \\"have the care and trusteeships of generation after generation.\\" In the mid-1960s, the sculpture garden was constructed in the middle of the Arboretum as a project of the College of Architecture Art and Planning. By 1965, the Plantations consisted of . By 1970, the university was issuing a publication called The Cornell Plantations, which contained general articles on nature and environmental topics. Beginning in the early 1970s, the Arboretum was upgraded with new roads and plantings funded by major gifts from oil industry figure Floyd R. Newman, and in 1982 the Arboretum was formally named in his honor (as were several other buildings and facilities at Cornell over the years). During the 1980s, the Plantations experienced people stealing pines and firs for Christmas trees, with in some cases trees being taken that were worth several thousand dollars. A successful countermeasure created by Gerardo Sciarra at the Plantations was covering the trees with a harmless yet visually unpleasant \\"Ugly Mix\\" spray that included hydrated limestone, an anti-desiccant, and water. The technique was subsequently recommended to others worried about tree theft. In 2009, the Plantations suffered from a series of thefts of new or rare plants. A director at the Plantations, which had no security in place, said that the thieves must have been experienced horticulturalists and that the loss of research and species had been a demoralizing experience. At the start of the 21st century, the Plantations embarked on a construction program which included: Arboretum Center (2000), Horticultural Center (2001), Mullestein Winter Garden (2002), Ramin Administration Building (2003), Rowley Carpenter Shop (2004), Plant Production Facility (2007), and Lewis Education Center (2008). The new $7.5 million Brian C. Nevin Welcome Center was dedicated on October 28, 2010. Five years in the designing and building, the new facility was built to LEED gold standards and won a 2010 Award of Excellence from Canadian Architect magazine. By the 2010s, the name Cornell Plantations was proving problematic, due to the association of the word with plantations in the American South and slavery in the United States. In 2015 the university's Black Students United organization demanded that Cornell \\"change the name of [it] as soon as possible.\\" The name was technically inaccurate as well, with plantations usually being a large- scale monocultural for commercial purposes, which this was not. A change of the name was under consideration for the better part of ten years, and then during 2014‚Äì16 there were focus groups, surveys, and polls taken to determine a favorite among nine possible different names for the Plantations, with the one chosen being that. Current extent =F.R. Newman Arboretum= A panoramic view from Newman Overlook, one of the highest points in the arboretum and campus The F.R. Newman arboretum contains the following collections on : ; Chestnut Collection :Established in 2000 with 5 transplanted, grafted chestnut trees for each of 5 cultivars. At present 4 trees remain, representing 3 of the 5 cultivars. Eventually 25 cultivars will be represented. ; Conifer Collection :Several sites with 21 taxa of firs (excluding dwarf forms), 39 of pines, and 25 of spruces. ; Flowering Crabapple Collection :83 cultivars in a new collection; many trees are quite small. ; Maple Collection :One of the core collections. One site contains Red Maple (Acer rubrum), Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum), Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum), and Striped Maple (Acer pensylvanicum). Another contains an overstory of Acer √ó freemanii with an understory of shade-loving maples, including snakebark maples (Acer davidii and Acer tegmentosum) and small trees similar to the Japanese maple, such as Acer shirasawanum and Acer pseudosieboldianum. A third site consists primarily of small Asian Maples. ; Oak Collection :50 oak taxa in a fairly young collection, with a goal of acquiring all species hardy in Zone 5. ; Urban Tree Collection :Planted throughout the arboretum. ; Walnut Collection :The oldest collection, planted in the early 1960s. 20 cultivars, representing Black Walnut (Juglans nigra), Butternut (Juglans cinerea) and Heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia).

A sundial at the Robison Herb Garden ;Robison Herb Garden :Opened in 1974 after 20 years of being envisioned and 2 years of construction, it consists of 17 raised beds of herbs, arranged by theme as follows: Ornamental Herbs; Herbs of the Ancients; Herbs in Literature; Bee Herbs; Salads and Potherbs; Edible flowers; Herbs of the Native Americans; Medicinal Herbs; Culinary Herbs; Economic Herbs; Dye Herbs; Tea Herbs; Fragrant Herbs; Sacred Herbs; Scented Geraniums; Savory Seed Herbs; and Tussie-Mussies and Nosegays. The sources to begin the garden came from around the world, with some species linked to cultures from antiquity. More than 500 plants are included. The design inspired plans for a similar herb garden in New London, Connecticut in 1980. ;Heritage Vegetable Garden :Four beds, representing typical vegetables grown in the northeastern United States in the 18th century, the late 19th century, World Wars I and II, and today's gardens. Such gardens are not common. The gardener in charge of it has been mentioned in newspaper columns as an expert in growing tomatoes. ;International Crop and Weed Garden :Crop plants and economically important plants from around the world, including bananas, sugar cane, coffee, tea, sorghum, cotton, grasses, and forbs (non-grass plants eaten by livestock); also a collection of weeds arranged in an attractive agricultural setting. ;Peony and Sun Perennial Garden :Over 90 cultivars of peonies, as well as a display of recent perennial cultivars suitable for sunny locations. ;Poisonous Plants Garden :Plants poisonous to livestock, including Atropa, Chelidonium, Cicuta, Digitalis, Lobelia, Phytolacca, and Rheum.

These areas contain some of walking trails. * Bald Hill ‚Äì Mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is abundant in this area. * Beebe Lake and Woods ‚Äì In 1828, to capture the waterpower of Fall Creek, Ezra Cornell help construct Beebe Dam on Fall Creek. The dam and Lake have since been upgraded. * Bluegrass Lane Natural Areas ‚Äì located near the Robert Trent Jones Golf Course. * Brooktondale Meadow * Carter Creek Preserve ‚Äì of woodlands about southwest of Cornell. * Cascadilla Gorge ‚Äì a gorge formed as Cascadilla Creek drops from the campus to downtown Ithaca, with a walking trail and many waterfalls. * Cascadilla Meadows ‚Äì Cascadilla Creek was channelized when the Wilson Lab was constructed in this meadow flood plain. * Cayuga Marsh ‚Äì a low-lying wetland of cattails (Typha latifolia) at the north end of Lake Cayuga. * Cayuga Lake ‚Äì on northeast shore. * Etna Fringed Gentian Area * Fall Creek Valley North * Fall Creek Valley South * Fischer Old-Growth Forest ‚Äì a preserve containing rare examples of yellow oak (Quercus muehlenbergii). * Hertel Bowl * Lick Brook * Lighthouse Point ‚Äì a biological station located a bit over from campus on the eastern shore of Lake Cayuga. * McDaniel Meadow, Woods and Swamp ‚Äì former farm about north of campus. * McGowan Woods and Meadow * McLean Bogs a National Natural Landmark containing two small kettle bogs located in Dryden, New York. * Mitchell Street Natural Areas ‚Äì examples of abandoned agricultural land. * Monkey Run * Mount Pleasant * Mundy Wildflower Garden * North Campus Natural Areas * Park Park ‚Äì Forest Home Drive near New York Route 366 * Polson Natural Area * Purvis Road Natural Areas ‚Äì * Renwick Slope * Slaterville 600 ‚Äì that includes the Slaterville Wildflower Preserve and old growth forest, given to the university by the Lloyd Library and Museum under condition that it remain forever wild. * Slim Jim Woods ‚Äì borders the arboretum. * Steep Hollow Creek * The Tarr-Young Preserve * Turkey Hill Road Meadow * Upper Cascadilla * Warren Woods ‚Äì Academic role Typically the Plantations' Director has been funded as a professor of Horticulture in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, although 85 percent of the Plantations' budget has come from gifts. The Botanic Gardens continue to grow as it receives donations of environmentally sensitive land throughout New York State. , the Plantations had a $2.9 million annual operating budget. In conjunction with the Department of Horticulture in the College of Agriculture, the Plantations has sponsored a Graduate Fellowship in Public Garden Leadership, where students earn a Master of Professional Studies degree after a four-semester program. The program of study requires an internship, selection of a particular topic of interest, and completion of an action project. Numerous scientific papers have been published that relate to work done at the Plantations or written by academics affiliated with the Plantations. The Plantations offers three courses for academic credit and a number of informal lectures and tours. Lab work is done at the Plantations by students taking other courses in various subjects, including geology courses in the interdisciplinary Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. Indeed, the greater Plantations has a connection of some kind to over a hundred courses at Cornell. The Plantations' Director has also been responsible for summer session courses at the Plantations aimed towards alumni and horticultural enthusiasts. The Botanic Gardens operate side-by-side with Cornell's other programs. Cornell's academic buildings, which are owned by either the university or New York State (for statutory college buildings), are on a landscaped campus with Plantations' gardens interspersed among them; the Plantations maintains four such gardens on Cornell's central campus. In addition, the College of Agriculture operates the Arnot Woods as a teaching forest, about southwest of Ithaca; it was given to the university in 1927. Near the Plantations, the College operates the Dilmun Hill Student Farm, which practices sustainable agriculture. The College operates Campus Area Farms that comprise 11 different farms and on campus and nearby. The difference between the Plantations and these other adjacent properties is that the Plantations are open to the public and are designed for both instruction as well as leisure, while the other properties are closed to the general public and focused upon teaching and research. Aside from physical proximity, the Plantations has affiliations with a number of Cornell academic departments. In fact, during the latter part of the 20th century, public gardens attached to colleges and universities such as the Plantations became a popular trend, due to the beneficial effects they had on campus unity and recruitment of students, creating bonds with and outreach to the local community, and providing a basis for ongoing research as well as establishing a living museum. The Plantations earned a relatively brief mention as a campus diversion in the 112-page Cornell Desk Book publication of 1972 aimed at incoming students. The Cornell Daily Sun listed it in 2010 as one of the natural wonders of the Cornell and Ithaca areas that students frequently went past, or lived near to, without noticing. A 1973 survey of public arboreta by The New York Times listed the Plantations as one of the 17 best in the Eastern U.S. for educational value. The same paper characterized the Robison Herb Garden as \\"a student's living reference library\\" when it opened in 1974. The 200-page volume The Cornell Plantations, written by Ralph S. Hosmer, was published by the university in 1947, shortly after the gardens were so named. A film Cornell Plantations was made during 1974‚Äì1975 and shown on PBS in Connecticut and elsewhere. In 1987, the Plantations released a VHS video entitled A Year in the Garden, which showed seasonal changes in the F. R. Newman Arboretum and along the trails. The New York Times called the effort \\"thin\\" and best suited for Cornell alumni. The university published the volume Cornell Plantations Path Guide: The Gardens, Gorges, Landscapes, and Lore of Cornell in 1995, and a 172-page second edition was published with a slightly altered title in 2002. Working with the Newman's Own Foundation and the Center for Plant Conservation, the Plantations are trying to restore the regional population of the American globeflower (Trollius laxus). The Plantations are trying to use predatory beetles (Laricobius nigrinus) to control the spread of the hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA). Events and visiting The Plantations are open daily without charge from dawn to dusk. From the campus, one walks out Forest Home Drive past the College of Agriculture quadrangle; the nearest highway is New York State Route 366. Walk-up tours are offered twice a week. Adult volunteers also serve as stewards, tour guides and special event staff. Such docents are challenged by the large variety of plants; one joked in 2010 that, \\"The ones I don‚Äôt know the name of, I call Species Nocluesem.\\" The New York Times has recommended Cornell Plantations as a place to visit several times, calling it \\"a satisfying experience\\" in 1965, one of the sights of Cornell in 1979, a destination along a bicycling tour in 1985, \\"another free diversion\\" in 1989, and \\"one last outing before leaving [Ithaca]\\" in 2002. The Boston Globe recommended the Plantations in 2000 as a \\"free to the public museum of living plants\\". In 2007, The Ithaca Journal referred to it as \\"one of the area's gems\\" and three years later said it \\"combines the best of walking with the eye appeal of well tended gardens\\". The Buffalo News portrayed the Plantations in 2010 as one of the places that made Cornell worth a vacation for non-students. National Geographic's 1998 guide to the 300 best public gardens in North America has an entry for the Plantations. The American Automobile Association's New York TourBook lists the Plantations as one of five arboreta and sixty gardens in the state; it does not get the \\"GEM\\" rating that one of the arboreta and ten of the gardens receive. Fodor's travel book for New York State lists the Plantations as an ordinary entry and says the gardens have \\"interesting cold-weather colors and textures\\". The Moon Handbooks volume for the state also lists it as a regular entry, without much commentary, as does the Great Destinations series The Finger Lakes Book. The Fun with the Family Upstate New York volume groups it with several other sights as \\"a real bargain\\" to explore for free. Most enthusiastic is the Frommer's travel guide for New York State, which rates the Plantations as a one-star (\\"highly recommended\\") sight, saying the Plantations is \\"a real find and well worth a visit for garden lovers or anyone seeking a bit of solace.\\" The herb garden and knoll of rhododendrons come in for particular praise. The Plantations provide a venue for a number of annual activities, including a \\"Fall In\\" festival, a celebration of Arbor Day and the Cornell Reunion 5 Mile Run. The Plantations is one of eight cultural and educational sites on the Ithaca Discovery Trail network. The Friends of the Gorges is a Cornell student organization, supported by Cornell Plantations, that performs trail repair and maintenance and clean-ups.

Earlier thought to be found also in the Western Ghats, taxonomic studies have shown this to be a Sri Lankan endemic, differentiated from the Indian Dasia subcaeruleum. It is the only arboreal skink in Sri Lanka. Description This arboreal skink, about 8 cm long, in the genus Dasia is distinct from all other sister species in having a smaller number of scale rows at the mid-body (22-24) and an enlarged set of vertebral row scales. Like other reptiles their taxonomic identification is based on scalation. They have a pointed snout and the distance of the nostril to tip is longer than the diameter of the eye. The scales above the nostril are not in contact with each other and the fronto-nasal scale is equal in width and length. The prefrontals are large and are separated from another narrow frontal. The interparietal scale is variable in size and when large separates the parietals. There are a pair of nuchal (nape) scales, four scales above the eye with the second being largest and the first and second in contact with the frontal. There are 7 or 8 supraciliaries, with the first being longer than the others. There are two loreals which are longer than their height. The temporal scales are larger than the scales on the sides of the neck. The tympanum of the ear is sunken and is less than a fourth of the diameter of the eye. The dorsal scales have 3 or 5 blunt keels, two vertebral rows of scales are wider than the rest. The tail tapers to a point and is as long as the head and body. The limbs are short, the toes are long with 17 or 18 lamellae (or plate like scales) beneath the fourth toe. The palms and soles have flat tubercles with larger ones on the heel, especially in the male. The colouration is yellowish-olive above, with broad black bands which are as wide as the space between them. There are 5 or 6 of these bands on the neck and body with a black mark on the occiput extending forward as streaks on top of the head. There are two lateral stripes passing through the eye and nostril. The underside is yellow.Smith, M. A. 1935. The Fauna of British India. Reptilia and Amphibia Vol II - Sauria. Taylor and Francis. London. pp. 278-279 Habitat and distribution This is the only arboreal skink in Sri Lanka. Known much from the dry zone of the country, including Pallegama, Dambulla, Polonnaruwa, Bakamuna, Horana, Anuradhapura, Palatupana, Gampaha and Jaffna. It was also reported from southern India but the species that occurs there was found to be different and given the name of Dasia johnsinghi. Ecology Confined to the dry zone plains, where they are found on large trees, occupying tree holes as refuge. Reproduction Copulation is known in late January and 2 eggs are produced in early March.

The group was reported to have about 5,000 members in 2014. The association has promoted a range of scientifically discredited hypotheses, including the belief that HIV does not cause AIDS, that being gay reduces life expectancy, that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer, and that there is a causal relationship between vaccines and autism. It is opposed to the Affordable Care Act and other forms of universal health insurance. History During the winter of 1943, the Lake County (Indiana) Medical Committee opposed the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill, proposed legislation that would provide government health care for most U.S. citizens. Also opposed to the bill was the conservative National Physicians Committee. The committee began a membership drive in February 1944. By May 1944, the AAPS claimed members from all 48 states. In 1944, Time reported that the group's aim was the \\"defeat of any Government group medicine.\\" In 1966, The New York Times described AAPS as an \\"ultra-right-wing... political- economic rather than a medical group,\\" and said some of its leaders were members of the John Birch Society. In 2002, AAPS said that its members included Ron Paul and John Cooksey. Ron Paul's son, Rand Paul, was a member for over two decades until his election to the U.S. Senate. The group was reported to have about 4,000 members in 2005, and 5,000 in 2014. The executive director is Jane Orient, an internist and a member of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Positions AAPS is generally recognized as politically conservative or ultra-conservative, and its positions are unorthodox and at wide variance with federal health policy. The Washington Post summarized their beliefs in February 2017 as \\"doctors should be autonomous in treating their patients ‚Äî with far fewer government rules, medical quality standards, insurance coverage limits and legal penalties when they make mistakes\\". It opposed the Social Security Act of 1965 which established Medicare and Medicaid and encouraged member physicians to boycott Medicare and Medicaid. The organization requires its members to sign a \\"declaration of independence\\" pledging that they will not work with Medicare, Medicaid, or even private insurance companies. AAPS opposes mandated evidence- based medicine and practice guidelines, opposes abortion and over-the-counter access to emergency contraception and opposes electronic medical records. Political and legal activism =Gun control= The AAPS opposes gun control and does not recognize handgun violence as a public health problem. Instead, the AAPS insists that handguns save lives, and that gun research sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is politically motivated \\"junk science\\". =Social Security= AAPS went to court to block enforcement of a Social Security amendment that would monitor the treatment given to Medicare and Medicaid patients; in November 1975 the Supreme Court let stand a lower-court decision upholding the Social Security legislation. =Opposition to health-care reform= With several other groups, AAPS filed a lawsuit in 1993 against Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala over closed-door meetings related to the 1993 Clinton health care plan. The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of President Bill Clinton's health care taskforce. Judge Royce C. Lamberth initially found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide Ira Magaziner in his ruling. Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith. The AAPS was involved in litigation in 2001 against the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), arguing that it violated the Fourth Amendment by allowing government access to certain medical data without a warrant.

The AAPS stated the seizure was a violation of state law and that \\"It is not a crime for a patient to be in pain and repeatedly seek relief, and doctors should not be turned against patients they tried to help.\\" =Other cases= In 2007, AAPS assisted in the appeal against the conviction of Virginia internist William Hurwitz, who was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for prescribing excessive quantities of narcotic drugs after 16 former patients testified against him. Hurwitz was granted a retrial in 2006, and his 25-year prison sentence was reduced to 4 years and 9 months. Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons The association's Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons (JPandS), from 1996 to 2003 named the Medical Sentinel, is not listed in academic literature databases such as MEDLINE/PubMed or the Web of Science. The quality and scientific validity of articles published in the journal have been criticized by medical experts, and some of the viewpoints advocated by AAPS are rejected by mainstream scientists and other medical groups. The U.S. National Library of Medicine declined repeated requests from AAPS to index the journal, citing unspecified concerns. As of September 2016, JPandS was listed on Beall's list of potential or probable predatory open-access journals. Quackwatch lists JPandS as an untrustworthy, non-recommended periodical.

The Bladnoch is a river in Wigtownshire in the Machars of Galloway in southwest Scotland. One of the earliest descriptions of it is given by Sir Andrew Agnew of Lochnaw and Sir David Dunbar in an appendix to Andrew Symson's work \\"A Large Description of Galloway\\" written in the 17th century. In this they state that: Course The river Bladnoch rises at Loch Maberry in the parish of Kirkcowan, through which it runs south to Polbae. On its journey south it is joined by Reoch Burn as it passes through Carseriggan Moor. Continuing its journey it passes Isle- na-Gower and becomes a border between the afforested land at Hopeless Howe and the Ring of Barfad. Shortly after this it is met and joined by Black Burn. At this point the river is bordered on its east side by Barnley Plantation. Crossing the river at the stepping stones is a single-track road which links Mark of Shennanton with Little Eldrig. Shortly after this point the river widens briefly at Broad Wheel. Continuing on its journey southwards it is next forded by Shennanton Bridge where the A75 crosses it. Next we come to Linn Wood and the waterfall at Linn of Barhoise. The river then moves on past Barhoise Farm to Barhoise Mill. In 1684 according to Symson, this area had a salmon fishery with nets on both the Bladnoch and the Tarff. At the Mill of Barhoise, the Laird of Craichlaw had fishing rights. Barhoise Mill is a T-shaped two storey construction of granite, whinstone and slate, which is falling into a dilapidated state. The mill was driven by a wheel which was situated at the side of the building. Of this wheel only the wooden axle remains. The datestone above the door reads 1827, but this mill is most certainly a reconstruction of a much earlier one, perhaps connected with the Old Place of Glaisnick, a one-time nearby residence of the powerful Gordon family of Craichlaw. The main road from Kirkcowan to Wigtown and from Kirkcowan to Minnigaff via Glaisnick crossed the river just south of this mill. There are still stepping stones at the fording place east of Ring Farm. Due east of Kirkcowan the Bladnoch unites with the Tarf Water. Two miles below this point the Laird of Grainge had fishing rights \\"beneath which, at severall places the said river, the Laird of Dereagill, on Kirkinner side, and the Laird of Torhouse, on Wigtown side, have severall places where they take salmon by nets, both which Lairds have an equal interest therein; and some yeares again, they fish together, and divide their fish equally.\\" In the reign of King David I (1124‚Äì1153) the Order of Knights Templar (established in 1118) was introduced into Galloway. These knights dressed in a white habit with a red cross on their cloaks. They operated Inns of Hospitality as one of their activities, and one of the inns was situated beside the Spittal of Bladnoch, the crossing place on the main road from Wigtown to Portpatrick and Ireland. About one mile (1.6 km) south of Dalreagle, in the parish of Kirkinner, the Water of Malzie empties itself into the Bladnoch. Soon after this the river comes to Torhouse Mill, one of the early mills which, incorporating a farm steading, ground corn. The wheelpit and lade, part of the 19th century mill which was powered by the river, can still be traced. Very near this on the riverside is the ruined site of a waulkmill which was a wool manufactory. By 1792 it employed 40 workers making \\"plaiding and flannel\\" for export to England. A weir below this is just south of the site of a farina mill. Newmilns is two miles (3 km) west of Wigtown. It was a small T-shaped mill of three storeys, built into the river bank. The building has been completely gutted and is now made use of as a store and byre. The wheelpit is at the rear of the mill, and the remains of a breastshot wheel with wooden axle and cast iron rims can be seen. The wheel had a diameter of and was wide. The only present industry on the mill section of the river is a modern trout farm on the site of the former Torhouse grain mill. It was opened in the 1970s. Past these mills the river runs through Cotland and Kirwaugh Plantations. The scenery at this point is described by Samuel Robinson as being the finest along the fifteen-mile (24 km) extent of the river's course. After all these plantations the river descends to a large pool called Linghoor, which has been known since the 18th century as one of Scotland's finest salmon pools. The buildings which were formerly part of Bladnoch Creamery stand on the south side of the river near the old ford. From this place the river flows in several wide curves until it passes Wigtown harbour. From there it flows into Wigtown Bay.

It is classified Critically Endangered by the IUCN and considered extinct in much of its former range. Description River terrapins of different age cohorts: (from top to bottom) hatchling of about a week old, one year old and two years old. The northern river terrapin is one of Asia's largest freshwater and brackwater turtles, reaching a carapace length of up to 60 cm and a maximum weight of 18 kg. Its carapace is moderately depressed, with a vertebral keel in juveniles. The plastron is large, strongly angulate laterally in the young, convex in the adult. The head is rather small, with a pointed and upwards-tending snout. The legs have band- like scales. The upper surface of the carapace and the soft parts are generally olive-brown, while the plastron is yellowish. Head and neck are brown with reddish bases. Males in breeding coloration have a black head and neck with a crimson or orange dorsal surface and red or orange forelegs. The colour of the pupils also changes during this period, to brown in females and yellow-white in males. During the breeding season, the color of the pupils of a female brown whereas the pupils in the males become yellowish-white. Two subspecies are recognized: B. b. baska (Gray, 1831) and B. b. ranongensis (Nutaphand, 1979). Distribution and habitat The species is currently found in Bangladesh (in the Sundarbans), Cambodia, India (parts- West Bengal & Odisha), Indonesia and Malaysia. It is regionally extinct in Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It is strongly aquatic but uses terrestrial nesting sites, frequenting the tidal areas of estuaries, large rivers, and mangrove forests. Ecology The northern river terrapin is omnivorous, taking waterside plants and small animals such as clams. The species prefers freshwater habitats and moves to brackish river mouths or estuaries in the breeding season (December‚ÄìMarch), returning after laying their eggs. Individuals have been known to undertake long seasonal migrations of 50 to 60 miles to the sand banks where they were hatched. Females usually lay three clutches of 10-34 eggs each. Conservation The species is considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN, principally due to exploitation as a food item (including egg harvesting). Previously, immense numbers were shipped into the fish markets of Calcutta from throughout India; among the Bengali Hindus, the river terrapin was considered the most delectable of all turtles.http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp- content/uploads/file/Accounts/crm_5_037_baska_v1_2009.pdf It is still illegally exported from Indonesia and traded in large numbers in China. Loss of nesting beaches and pollution are also impacting the species. A hatchery and captive breeding project was established in Vawal National Park at Gazipur in Bangladesh and another in Sajnekhali Forest Station in the Sunderban Tiger Reserve in India with support from Turtle Survival Alliance.

It is found in the Nicobar Islands, eastern India (Assam), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, central and southern Vietnam, west Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines (Leyte, Luzon, Mindanao, Samar, Negros, Panay, etc.), Indonesia (Sulawesi, Ambon Island, Sumatra, Borneo, East Malaysia, Brunei, Nias, Enggano, Simeulue, Java, Sumbawa, Halmahera, Ceram, Seram, Buru, East Timor, Bali, Palawan and Maluku), and possibly China (Guangxi and Guangdong) and Sri Lanka. The type locality is \\"Amboine\\" (or \\"Amboina\\") Island, today Ambon Island in Indonesia. Description These turtles have blackish-brown to olive-brown colored shells that are not as ornate as many other box turtles. All have a blackish olive head with three yellow stripes on the side. The male can be identified by the slightly concave shape to its plastron. There is no specific pattern to what the underbellies may look like, for either sex. The only true way of telling age is to guess by the texture of the shell, as growth rings form irregularly. There are four subspecies that are primarily differentiated by differences in the color and shape of the carapace:Filella (1997); measurements taken at the LCRC 2006-SEP-20. * Cuora amboinensis amboinensis (Wallacean box turtle) ‚Äì eastern Indonesian islands: Ambon Island, Sulawesi, the Moluccas, Buru, Seram, and East Timor and smaller islands in the region. :Has a quite flat shell with flared marginal scutes.

(2005) Other hybrids are known, like C. amboinensis √ó Cuora trifasciata. Ecology and status They are omnivorous, with younger turtles tending towards more meat consumption and older turtles eating a more herbivorous diet. Although Cuora amboinensis is classified as endangered by the IUCN,ATTWG (2000) they are able to thrive in some areas of the world. For example, they can be found in the storm drains of Brunei. These are seriously polluted, and yet seem to be extremely popular habitat for these turtles and other animals that can withstand eutrophication. In some places, this species is hunted for use in folk medicine.da N√≥brega Alves et al. (2008) Cuora amboinensis can be quite difficult to breed in captivity, compared with other box turtles. These turtles have a mating ritual very similar to that of other box turtles. No courtship occurs, the male simply climbs upon the female. He then snaps at her head, so that she closes the front half of her shell, opening the back. Pet care Adult C. amboinensis amboinensis Juvenile Malayan box turtles (Cuora amboinensis kamaroma) Any individual considering a turtle as a pet should thoroughly research both general care and the care of the particular species in which they are interested. Individuals considering a Cuora amboinensis as a pet should keep in mind that it is a tropical, non- hibernating species who needs much warmer water (about 82 degrees F) than many other semi-aquatic species. The adult Cuora amboinensis is smaller in comparison to more well-known species such as the red-eared slider or cooter, but a fully grown adult will generally need at least a 55-gallon tank and this habitat should be semi-aquatic, not terrestrial. Cuora amboinensis is far more aquatic than many other box turtle species. Unfortunately, this has often led to pet Cuoras being incorrectly housed in terrestrial habitats. Although they are clumsy swimmers and need shallower water than other semi-aquatic turtles that are stronger swimmers, (e.g., sliders, cooters, and painteds), they tend to vastly prefer being in the water to on land. In the wild, they will often live in almost entirely in water only emerging to bask and to lay eggs. They can even mate in the water.

Etymology The specific name, hamiltonii, is in honor of Scottish botanist and ichthyologist Francis Hamilton.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Geoclemys hamiltonii, p. 114). Description G. hamiltonii is mainly black with small yellowish spots, and a much-elevated carapace, with three interrupted keels or series of nodose prominences corresponding to the vertebral and costal shields. The posterior border of the carapace is strongly serrated in young, but feebly in the adult. The nuchal is moderate, broader posteriorly than anteriorly. The first vertebral is not or scarcely broader anteriorly than posteriorly. The second and third vertebrals are broader than long in the young, nearly as long as broad in the adult, narrower than the costals. The plastron is large, angulate laterally, truncate anteriorly. The posterior lobe of the plastron is much narrower than the opening of the shell, nearly as long as the width of the bridge, deeply notched posteriorly. The head is rather large. The snout is very short, not projecting. The upper jaw is emarginated mesially. The width of the mandible at the symphysis nearly equals the horizontal diameter of the orbit. A large shield covers the upper surface of the snout and the crown, sometimes divided into three, one shield around the upper jaw and one on each side between the eye and the ear. The digits are webbed to the claws. The tail is extremely short. The shell is dark brown or blackish, elegantly marked with yellow spots and radiating streaks, and the soft parts are dark brown or blackish, with round yellow spots, largest on the head and neck.Boulenger GA (1890).

Described in 1912, its type locality is given as \\"Near Kavalai in the Cochin State Forests, inhabiting dense forest, at an elevation of about 1500 feet above sea level\\".Henderson (1912) Only two specimens were found at that time, and no scientist saw this turtle in the next 70 years. It was finally rediscovered in 1982, and since then a number of specimens have been found and some studies have been conducted about its affiliation and habits.Praschag et al. (2006) Like its relatives, it belongs to the subfamily Geoemydinae of the family Geoemydidae, formerly known as Bataguridae. It was once placed in the genus Geoemyda and subsequently moved to Heosemys. But as it seems, the Cochin forest cane turtle forms a quite distinct lineage closely related to Melanochelys. Thus, nowadays it is recognized as a monotypic genus, named Vijayachelys in honor of the famous Indian herpetologist Jagannathan Vijaya (1959-1987) who rediscovered this species in 1982 and until her death extensively studied it. A diagnosis of the osteology of Vijayachelys was published in 2006. Description The carapace is considerably depressed, with a prominent mid-line keel, as well as one less pronounced lateral keel on each side. Its posterior margin is feebly reverted and not or only indistinctly serrated. The nuchal scute is small. The first vertebral scute is broader in front than behind and larger than the second, third and fourth vertebral shields. These are considerably broader than long, as broad as the costal scutes.Henderson (1912), Praschag et al. (2006) The plastron is sizeable, being nearly as large as the shell opening; it is connected to the carapace by ligaments and particularly in females there is little ossification between the shields of the shell. The plastron is angled at the sides and openly emarginate at the forward and aft opening. The width of the plastron bridge is less than the length of the hind lobe; the longest median suture is between the abdominal scute, the shortest between the gular scute. The axillary and inguinal scutes are very small; one of the latter is even absent. Cane turtle in the Anaimalai Hills Its head is rather large, with a truncated snout as long as the sizeable orbit; the upper jaw is hooked, with small premaxillae. The mandibular symphysis is very long, exceeding the maximum diameter of the orbit in width. On the hind part of the head, the skin is divided into moderately large shields. The skull lacks a temporal arch and has the frontal bone extended to form a considerable part of the orbit. Seen from above, the prootic extends towards the front. The jugal does not contact the small laterally emarginated and medially constricted pterygoid process, the bones being separated by the maxilla and a gap. The triturating (chewing) surface of the upper jaw is long and narrow, more than four times as long as it is wide. The lower temporal fossa is large and strongly concave, providing an attachment for the massive chewing muscle. The forelegs are covered in enlarged squarish or pointed horny scales, particularly on the front. The hindlimbs are rather club-shaped, the anterior margins and anterior region of their heels bearing enlarged horny scales. The fingers are webbed one-third of their length, while the toes bear rudimentary webbing only. The tail is rather short and becomes very narrow behind the cloaca in males; it is a mere stub in females. The carapace of the type specimen was dark bronze; the plastron yellowish with two dark blotches on either side of the bridge. The jaws and upper front part of the head are bright yellow in the living animal, with a red spot on the top of the snout. The hind part of the head and the neck are brown. Limbs and tail are black. The length of the type specimen's shell is 120 mm, its breadth 83 mm and its depth 45 mm. Females are slightly larger than males, but this smallish turtle does not seem to exceed about 13 cm in carapace length even when fully grown. Ecology Anaimalai hills, Western Ghats This turtle inhabits dense evergreen forest, presumably at lower elevations. According to the natives from whom Dr. Henderson obtained the type, the species inhabits short burrows underground and is indifferent about having water nearby (unlike some of its relatives, which are decidedly aquatic). The type as well as another younger specimen were kept in captivity for six months, and Dr. Henderson remarks that they did not show any special partiality for water and when handled did not emit the offensive odour known from the related Indian black turtle (Melanochelys trijuga).Smith (1941) The first captive specimens lived entirely upon vegetable food, but subsequently it has turned out that this turtle is omnivorous, eating any suitably sized plant and animal food.Smith (1941), Praschag et al. (2006)  Conservation  The Cochin forest cane turtle is listed as endangered (EN B1+2c v2.3) by the IUCN and is listed in CITES Appendix II. It is rarely found in the pet trade.ATTWG (2000), Praschag et al. (2006) The Kadar tribe people occasionally hunt the turtles for bush meat. Additional threats are posed by deforestation and planned hydroelectric projects. The turtles have a patchy distribution range but where they occur they can be found in relatively high densities. Still, this turtle is considered to be a rare species.Vijayachelys silvatica (Henderson 1912) ‚Äì Cochin Forest Cane Turtle.

It is set in the distant future, when the Moon has long since been terraformed into a lush paradise complete with its own animals, plants, and races. The Trilogy =The Darkangel= Darkangel, the first volume of the trilogy, was published in 1982.The Darkangel at WorldCat The book received favorable critical reception, winning the International Reading Association's annual \\"Children's Book Award\\" for first novel, listed on the American Library Association's \\"Best Books for Young Adults\\" roster, and was eventually chosen for the New York Times' \\"Notable Children's Booklist\\". In 1984, the novel won the Jane Tinkham Broughton Fellowship in Writing for Children from the Bread Loaf Writer's Conference, 1984.Awards and Honors at Moon and Unicorn In the first volume, Eoduin, a beautiful young woman, is abducted by a vampyre while out gathering flowers with her slave, Aeriel, and is carried off to be the vampyre's bride. Aeriel, determined to avenge her mistress, returns to the peak from which Eoduin was stolen and waits for the vampyre to return. Eventually, he takes her, but not to be his bride. She is to continue her existence as a slave, but now she has thirteen mistresses, the vampyre's brides, who have all been reduced to wraiths by the stealing of their blood, hearts, and souls. Unable to tell which is Eoduin, Aeriel eventually learns to love them all for her mistress' sake. Wandering in the garden of Irrylath, the vampyre's keep, Aeriel comes upon a duarough, a tiny man who turns to stone in sunlight, but becomes flesh in shadow. He is a mage, and he gives her a rhyme and sends her on a quest, for if the darkangel (the vampyre) can be destroyed before he takes his fourteenth and last wife, then the power of the White Witch (his 'mother') will be checked for a time. His death will also prevent his becoming a full vampyre and joining with his six 'brothers' in trying to rule the world. And so, Aeriel flees the castle and begins a quest that takes her wandering far into the desert to find the hoof of a starhorse, the traditional guardian of the realm that the vampyre has usurped. With this talisman, she prepares to defeat the vampyre by using the starhoof to make a brew that would kill him. Upon her return to the castle, Aeriel is told she will be killed. But Aeriel's execution is stayed so that she can make a wedding sari for his fourteenth, and last, bride. He leaves, only to return empty-handed because none of the brides are more beautiful than Aeriel has become, having been physically changed by her journeys in the desert. The vampyre demands that Aeriel become his bride, much to her dismay. In the wedding ritual, Aeriel gives the vampyre the brew that will kill him. In the end, Aeriel finds that she cannot kill her darkangel because he is still beautiful, and because there is a trace of good in him. She gives up her life to save him, cutting out her heart to replace his, which the White Witch covered in lead. The duarough, Talb, who witnesses this, takes the former vampyre's (now reverted to his human name of Irrylath) heart, removes the lead, and places it into Aeriel, saving her life and making them one. =A Gathering of Gargoyles= The second book in the trilogy was published in 1985 A Gathering of Gargoyles at WorldCat and was a semifinalist for the ALA \\"Best Books for Young Adults\\" roster. In the second book, Aeriel and Irrylath, the redeemed darkangel who is now Aeriel's husband, are in Esternesse, Irrylath's mother's kingdom. Aeriel should be happy, but she is not, for Irrylath shuns her, not allowing her to sleep in the same room with him or even to touch him. Into this time of grief come the maidens who were once Irrylath's other brides. They give Aeriel the second part of the rhyme that sent her questing before and send her once more into the world. Her new quest is to find the lons, the traditional guardians of the world's kingdoms created by the Old One, Ravenna, in ancient times . Along the way, Aeriel finds the gargoyles she used to tend at Irrylath's castle, when he was the Darkangel. The gargoyles, who have been trying to protect the people of the world from the other darkangels, remember Aeriel and join her. She also meets Roshka, a prince who may be her brother, and Erin, a dark-skinned girl who refuses to be parted from her. For a time, Aeriel gets drugged and held prisoner in a castle when a nameless lord asks for her hand in marriage, due to her resemblance to his past lover, and she refuses him. Aeriel eventually reaches Terrain, the land where she was raised as a slave, to seek the advice of the sibyl of Orm. The sibyl has been killed by an agent of the White Witch, but this phony sibyl is defeated by the gargoyles and Irrylath, who has followed Aeriel. The gargoyles are revealed to be the lost lons, and they agree to go into battle against the Witch with Irrylath and his brothers. Irrylath confesses to Aeriel that he is not free to love her until the Witch is destroyed, because the Witch once made him her lover. =The Pearl of the Soul of the World= The Pearl of the Soul of the World, 1990 The final volume was published in 1990.The Pearl of the Soul of the World at WorldCat It was named an ALA \\"Best Book for Young Adults\\" and an IRA \\"Young Adult's Choice\\" book. In this volume, Aeriel stumbles through a cavern, nameless, voiceless and with no memory. A pin in her skull, placed there by an agent of the Witch, forces her to avoid thinking, which causes extreme pain. Found by a trio of duaroughs, Aeriel is then called to the deserted City of Crystalglass (a.k.a. NuRavennna), a stronghold of the Ancients where the mage Ravenna still lives. Ravenna heals Aeriel, who remembers how she was overpowered by the Witch's bird, who put the pin in her head. She had left camp alone after witnessing a scene between Irrylath and another woman, who was trying to convince him that Aeriel was like the Witch (a sorceress seeking to control him) and that he should love her instead. Ravenna gives Aeriel the third part of the rhyme and the final portion of her quest begins. Ravenna tells Aeriel the truth about her world: it was merely a playground of the Ancient ones, who treated her people as slaves. The Ancients created weather machines, which are slowly running down. They abandoned the world to return to their own (Oceanus), but war and plague have since destroyed all life on Oceanus. Ravenna stayed in Aeriel's world to try to save it. She is old, and hopes to pass all her knowledge and sorcery to a successor, who will take care of the world. Her daughter is the White Witch, who turned to evil when she found out she was a \\"halfling\\" and could not go to Oceanus. Ravenna charges Aeriel with carrying a pearl filled with all her knowledge to the Witch. She must persuade the Witch to turn from evil and take up the task of saving the world. After creating the pearl, Ravenna dies. Aeriel travels to the Witch's castle. Together they watch the battle between the Witch's forces and Irrylath's. Aeriel thinks her side is winning as the darkangels are killed. She realizes she's been duped. The Witch does not care about her army or her darkangels. She has built a chariot to take her to Oceanus; she needs to feed on souls to gain the strength to go and plans to capture Aeriel's friends after the battle. Aeriel warns her friends to flee. She hands the pearl to the Witch. Touching the pearl, the Witch is forced to realize the truth, that Oceanus is dead. She refuses the pearl's power and the task of saving the world; she says she cannot be saved because she cut out her heart and became purely evil. She dies, and the power of the pearl passes into Aeriel instead. Aeriel falls into a flood created by the destruction of the Witch's castle. She is about to give up her last breath when Irrylath saves her, at risk to himself. Irrylath realizes that Aeriel did not know how the Witch broke him and made him serve her, nor was Aeriel seeking to control him in the same way. They finally kiss and spend time together. Aeriel is awoken by the spirit of Ravenna, inside her. With the Witch dead, Ravenna claims that Aeriel must be the one to save the world. Ravenna's sorcery is escaping, and Aeriel must gather it up. The task will take all her energy; she must leave Irrylath. Ravenna reveals that Aeriel's body died when the Witch's pin when removed from her head. Ravenna saved her eyes, heart, mind, and soul, and built her a new body. She will live forever, unlike Irrylath. Also, one of her ancestors was also an Ancient One; there were many halflings created besides the Witch. Aeriel does not want to leave Irrylath, but she doesn't want the world to die, either. She thinks that Irrylath only loves her because he is forced to, because she has his heart inside her. She cuts out their hearts and switches them back, so that he will be free to leave her. But when he wakes up, he still wants to be with Aeriel. With the battle over, Irrylath's brothers and the other leaders gather. Each asks Aeriel to come to his or her land, but she turns them down, telling them to rule instead. Irrylath wants to be with Aeriel, but she must go to NuRavenna and take up her task of gathering the sorcery and saving the world. Irrylath has promised to rule over his kingdom and therefore cannot go with her. Erin, Aeriel's closest friend and \\"shadow,\\" goes with Aeriel, as do the golden spirits of the thirteen original brides of Irryalth (the Darkangel).

Geographic range Hardella thurjii is found in northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh in the watersheds of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus rivers.

Sexual dimorphism Hardella thurjii exhibits sexual dimorphism. Mature females are three times the size of mature males. According to Das, maximum straight carapace length in females is , but in males maximum straight carapace length is only .Das 2002. Reproduction The reproductive habits of H. thurjii are unique among reptiles in that the females lay their eggs under water rather than on dry land. Their reproductive cycle follows seasonal changes in the water levels of the rivers in which they live. In autumn, females lay their eggs under water, where higher water levels submerge the eggs for 40 to 45 days. In the winter, lower water levels expose the eggs for five months. The rising water levels of spring submerge the almost mature eggs once again, and the turtles hatch in the river. Indian zoologist Dhruvajyoti Basu first documented the unique reproductive habits of the brahminy river turtle in 2011.

It was the type species of its former genus Kachuga. Females can grow to a shell length of and weigh , but males are considerably smaller. The turtles like to bask in the sun on land. In the breeding season, the heads and necks of male turtles exhibit bright red, yellow and blue coloration. The females excavate nests in which they lay clutches of up to thirty eggs. Historically, this turtle was found in central Nepal, northeastern India, Bangladesh and probably Burma, but it has suffered declines in population due to being harvested for meat and shells, drowned in fishing nets, water pollution, hydro-electric schemes and habitat loss. Fewer than four hundred adult females are thought to remain in the wild, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature rating this turtle as being \\"critically endangered\\". India has put conservation measures in place, and a captive breeding programme has been initiated. Description It can weigh up to and have shells as long as . Males reach only half the length of females. At the end of the rainy season, the heads and necks of male turtles develop a brilliant courtship coloration of red, yellow, white, and blue, with 6 distinctive bright red stripes on top of the head. The carapace of the young is strongly keeled. The keels are tubercular posteriorly on the second and third vertebral shields. The posterior margin is strongly crenulated. The marginal serrature disappears in adolescent specimens and the vertebral keel, after being reduced to a series of low knobs, vanishes entirely in the full-grown, the carapace of which is very convex. The nuchal shield is small, trapezoidal and broadest posteriorly. The first vertebral is as broad or broader in front as behind. The second vertebral is longer than the third, with which it forms a straight transverse suture. The fourth is longest and forms a broad suture with the third. The second vertebral is broader than long in the young, and as long as broad in the adult. Plastron is angulate laterally in the young. The anterior and posterior lobes are rather narrow and shorter than the width of the bridge, truncate anteriorly and are openly notched posteriorly. The longest median suture is between the abdominals and the shortest is between the gulars, which equals about one half that between the humerals. The suture between gulars and humerals forms an obtuse angle, as does that between humerals and pectorals. The inguinal is large and the axillary is smaller. The head is moderate size with an obtuse and moderately prominent snout. The jaws have denticulated edges with the upper not notched mesially. Alveolar surfaces are very broad, the median ridge of the upper jaw being somewhat nearer the outer than the inner margin. Choanae are behind the line of the posterior borders of the orbits. The width of the lower jaw at the symphysis equals the diameter of the orbit. The limbs have transversely enlarged, band-like scales which are colored brown above and yellowish below. The nape has red longitudinal lines. Geographic range This reptile was historically widespread in Central Nepal, NE India, Bangladesh, primarily in deep flowing freshwater rivers with terrestrial nest sites in the watershed of the Ganges River and probably NW Burma. Type locality: \\"India\\"; restricted by M.A. Smith 1931:131, to \\"N. India.\\" The National Chambal Sanctuary portion of the Chambal River has received moderate protection since 1979 as India's only protected riverine habitat. It is believed to be one of the last viable habitats for this species, though even here, B. kachuga are rare. Recent annual nesting surveys indicate fewer than 400 adult females remaining in the wild. Diet The diet of red-crowned roofed turtles consists entirely of aquatic plants.Das, I. 2002. A Photographic Guide to Snakes and Other Reptiles of India. Ralph Curtis Books. Sanibel Island, Florida. 144 pp. . (\\"Painted Roofed Turtle Kachuga kachuga\\", p. 127.) Behavior They leave the water to thermoregulate by basking in the sun on rocks, logs, and sandbanks. Reproduction Adult females lay eggs in March and April. The eggs are long by wide. Clutch size varies from 11 to 30 eggs. Threats The large Batagur turtles are probably the most threatened freshwater turtles in India. Their populations have now been drastically reduced due to poaching for their meat and shells, accidental drowning in fishing gear, water pollution, hydroelectric infrastructure projects, habitat destruction by sand mining, and egg predation by jackals. Conservation Since 2004, B. kachuga has reproduced in captivity at the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust. A total of 132 eggs were laid through 2009 with an overall viability of 69%. 75 hatchlings were produced from these eggs, with 24 young turtles sent to Uttar Pradesh for release in 2007. Since 2006, the Chambal River Sanctuary Program of Turtle Survival Alliance- India has implemented projects to protect wild nests, collect and hatch wild eggs in hatchery conditions, raise hatchlings to at about 4 years age, conduct survival and migration studies of tagged and released hatchlings and conduct surveys over of river to determine nesting locations, nesting density, nest depredation rates, and anthropogenic pressures on the turtles.

The locomotives could be used to handle goods and also for passenger traffic. History The Midland Great Western Railway was looking to modernise its motive power fleet, and turned to their Chief Mechanical Engineer, Walter H. Morton, to design a locomotive which could be capable of handling goods, and if required, for local passenger traffic. The specific official need for the new class was to replace the poorly performing MGWR Class C 4-4-0 locomotives on passenger and limited mail services on the Mullingar‚ÄîDublin section of the line. The resulting design from the Broadstone Works (Dublin) Drawing Office was for a six-coupled (0-6-0) tender locomotive, and the first appearing from the works in 1921, the last in 1924. There are some thoughts the design may have been influenced by the availability of cheap surplus parts following the First World War. This was the last complete class of locomotives designed and built at Broadstone before closure and transfer of work to Inchicore Works. The only other locomotives to follow from Broadstone were the first of the \\"kit-built\\" Woolwich Moguls (GSR Class 372) before this was also transferred to Inchicore. There was a total of 23 members of the class, the first three were Class F, the next ten (including the five Armstrong Whitworth built locomotives) were Class Fa, and the last ten with raised running plates were Class Fb. All were classified by the Great Southern Railways (GSR) as Class 623, or Class J5. All passed to the C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (CI√â) on its formation in 1945. Examples of the class survived until 1963, almost to the end of steam on the CI√â. Oil firing In the severe winter of 1946/47 coal was in short supply and, with services disrupted, the CI√â. took the decision to convert 97 locomotives to oil-burning, the main classes chosen for this being the various 2-6-0s and the 623s, although this was extended to some 4-6-0s. Locomotives which were converted to oil-burning had a white circle painted on the smokebox and tender sides. A supply of coal from America arrived in March 1947 but it took a further three months to build up stocks before normal services could be resumed. Service Although initially fitted with steam heat for passenger and limited mail services, and noted for ability to perform GSR Class 372 mogul 2-6-0 services when required, it was also observed they had a high level of wear and attrition when used on such work. In practice they were predominately employed on freight work, proving to be able to successfully work heavy livestock trains at moderately high speeds, albeit with a somewhat high maintenance requirement. Livery Since 1913 the MGWR had been painting all locomotives black with red linings so they being built from 1921 they would not have carried the bright emerald green of other MGWR locomotives. Unlike most MGWR engines they were not named and they carried painted rather than cast iron cabside number plates. On their first visit to the workshops following the 1925 amalgamation to form the GSR the class were repainted into the standard \\"dark battleship grey\\" colours of the new company. Buffer beams were vermilion. Following the absorption of the GSR into CI√â in 1945, and CI√âs nationalisation in 1950, the only changes which took place were the addition of the light green CI√â \\"flying snail\\" logo to the tender sides. The grey livery, like on most CI√â locomotives, remained until withdrawal in the early 1960s.

Distribution and habitat The species occurs in the north-eastern and south-eastern parts of Bangladesh, in India (Assam) and possibly in Bhutan. It is found in terrestrial and freshwater habitats in areas with upland tropical moist forest, and fast-flowing streams and perhaps also small rivers. Oxbow lakes may also be inhabited, but shell morphology suggests an adaptation to fast-flowing waters. Ecology The species is amphibian. In the cooler months of the dry season, from December to February, it basks during most of the day; individuals living in cooler hill streams may do so year round. The turtle is shy and never basks on river banks, but only on emergent logs or rocks. At the slightest disturbance, it will dive quickly to the middle of the river, hiding between rocks. Juveniles often flee into accumulations of dead leaves for camouflage and remain motionless. Reproduction Assam roofed turtles nest between late October and February, corresponding with the cool, dry season, and produce clutches of 6 to 12 eggs. Hatchlings appear mainly between March and April, at the beginning of the southeast monsoons. The eggs need to undergo a diapause at cooler temperatures lasting between 6 and 8 weeks in order to hatch successfully. Conservation The Assam roofed turtle is a rare species known only from a few individuals; it is believed to have one of the narrowest distributions of any south Asian geoemydid. It is exploited for its meat and eggs for local consumption or be collected for the pet trade especially in Asia where this turtle fetches high prices as pets. Habitat destruction by logging and incidental capture in fishing gear are also thought to present threats. The species is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN.

A. 1890. Fauna of British India. Reptilia and Batrachia. Recognition The arched, elliptical carapace (to 23 cm) is widest behind the middle and unserrated posteriorly. The medial keel is prominent with a strong spinelike posterior projection on the 3rd vertebral. Vertebrals 2 and 5 are broader than long, while 1, 3, and 4 are longer than broad. Vertebral 3 is posteriorly pointed while the 4th is anteriorly pointed, making the seam between these two scutes very short. The carapace is brown, sometimes yellow or orange bordered, with a red to orange medial stripe. The plastron is long and narrow; the forelobe is much shorter than the broad bridge, and the hindlobe is slightly shorter than the bridge and contains a posterior anal notch. The humero-pectoral seam joins the plastral seam at an obtuse angle. The plastral formula is: abd > fem > an >< hum > pect >< gul. On the bridge, the inguinal and axillary scutes are nearly equal in length, or the inguinal is slightly larger. Plastron and bridge are yellow with at least two black elongated blotches on each scute, except the gulars and anals which have only a single blotch. The head is moderate in size with a projecting, short, pointed snout. Its upper jaw is not medially notched. Skin on the back of the head is divided into large scales. Dorsally, the head is black with a large crescent-shaped, orange to yellowish red blotch on each temple (these may unite posteriorly to form a V-shaped mark). The jaws are yellow, and the neck is black with numerous yellow stripes. Limbs are olive to gray, and spotted and bordered with yellow. They have large transverse scales. The karyotype is 2n = 52; 20 metacentric and submetacentric, 10 subtelocentric, and 22 acrocentric and telocentric chromosomes Males are brighter in color than females, and have long, thick tails with the vent beyond the carapacial rim. Females have short tails with the vent under the carapace. Females grow larger than males. Habitat This is a quiet-water turtle, occurring in quiet streams, canals, oxbows, ponds, and man-made water tanks. It also occurs in brackish coastal waters. A soft bottom and abundant aquatic vegetation are preferred conditions. It loves basking in the early morning sun. Basking helps the turtle to maintain its body temperature as well as for the synthesis of Vitamin D. Breeding Male P. tecta develop a small tubercle at the end of the thick tail during October, just before the breeding season, and shed it in March. This tubercle may help in probing the females cloacal vent during courtship. During courtship the male swims along the females side and may also circle her. Nesting has been reported in October, December, January and February, and February and March ; eggs were found in January and in March. P. tecta in Bangladesh may oviposit in two separate periods, from the beginning of December to mid-January and from mid-February to the end of March. A nest cavity 14‚Äì20 cm deep is usually dug. Clutches contain 3-14 elongated (35-45 x 21‚Äì29 mm) eggs. There are reports of clutches with a maximum of 15 ovoid (50-51 x 20‚Äì21 mm), white eggs, that tend to become bluish at hatching time. The natural incubation period lasts 70‚Äì144 days. Hatchlings have 34.1-35.2 mm carapaces and weigh 7 g; This species is omnivorous, feeding on aquatic plants, like water hyacinths and weeds, and animal prey such as crabs and snails; it also scavenges. Distribution Pangshura tecta inhabits the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, and Mahanadi river drainages in Pakistan, northern and peninsular India, and Bangladesh.

Atmometers are mainly used by farmers and growers to measure evapotranspiration (ET) rates of crops at any field location. Evapotranspiration is a measure of all of the water that evaporates from land surfaces plus the water that transpires from plant surfaces. Based on the amount of water that does evaporate and transpire, the user can water crops correspondingly, which results in less water use and possibly increased crop yields. Companies that currently sell atmometers include C&M; Meteorological Supply and Calsense.  Design  An atmometer consists of a porous, ceramic plate connected to a water reservoir by a glass or plastic tube. The device stands around tall with a diameter of . Water is drawn from the water reservoir through the tube to wet the plate. As the water on the plate evaporates, more water is drawn from the reservoir to re-wet the plate. A canvas cover made of Gore-Tex is placed over the plate to prevent anything from getting in. The canvas cover is important because it simulates the amount of solar radiation a plant absorbs under certain weather conditions and controls the rate of evaporation. Different types of canvas covers simulate different amounts of evapotranspiration rates that various plant surfaces would undergo. For example, alfalfa ET rates are estimated using the No. 54 green canvas cover, while grass ET rates are estimated using the No. 30 green canvas cover. A membrane between the plate and canvas cover prevents rain water from wetting the gauge yet allows water vapor to escape. A gauge that runs up the side of the atmometer measures the level of water (in inches) in the reservoir, which shows how much water has evaporated. An electronic model of the atmometer is also available, which includes a data logger attached to it. A data logger automatically records the level of water every time a change due to evaporation occurs. The data that the data logger records can be downloaded onto a computer to record the results. The electronic model eliminates possible human error that could occur from reading the gauge, but costs approximately $900 while the manual model costs approximately $300.  Use and maintenance  An atmometer is fairly easy to install and use. It is usually mounted on a wooden post about s above the ground in an area representative of the weather and field conditions. The plate of the atmometer should be placed in direct sunlight so the evaporation rates are not affected. It should not be placed near tall trees or buildings, as they can affect the amount of exposure that the atmometer has to environmental factors, which affect evapotraspiration rates. To measure the amount of water that has evaporated, calculate the change in water level on the gauge by subtracting the final water level from the initial water level.  Advantages (compared to weather stations)  In a 2003 study conducted on the Central Coast of California, the performance of atmometers was compared with that of the more expensive weather stations. Atmometers were placed adjacent to seven weather stations around the area and weekly values were recorded for each method. The results indicated that the atmometers and weather stations yielded very similar results, both producing comparable evapotranspiration (ET) readings. Under conditions of lower evapotranspiration, the atmometers produced slightly lower ET values than those of the weather stations. Studies conducted by Colorado State University and the United States Department of Agriculture in Fort Collins produced similar results. The atmometers produced evapotranspiration values that were very close to the data calculated from weather stations. These studies show that atmometers are especially useful for areas that do not have access to nearby weather stations and/or evapotranspiration data. * Low cost * Easy operation * Convenience * No computer or power required  Disadvantages (compared to weather stations)  * Potential weather damage can occur to the device * Constant need to refill water supply * Gauge must be read manually (only on manual model) See also * Pan evaporation  References   External links  * C&M; Meteorological Supply * Calsense Atmometer Category:Agronomy Category:Water and the environment ","title":"Atmometer"},{"id":"3666622","text":"James Manby Gully in the 1860s Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1876.

Along with his partner James Wilson, he founded a very successful \\"hydropathy\\" (as it was then called) clinic in Malvern, Worcestershire, which had many notable Victorians, including such figures as Charles Darwin and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, as clients. Gully's clinic using Malvern water in Great Malvern, and those that followed, were largely responsible for Malvern's rapid development from a village to a large town. He is also remembered as a suspect in the Charles Bravo poisoning case. Early life and education James Manby Gully was born in Kingston, Jamaica, the son of a wealthy coffee planter. Wall cited sectional p. 1 (Vol. p. 5). When he was 6 he was taken to England to attend school in Liverpool, then went on to the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe in Paris. He became a medical student at the University of Edinburgh in 1825, as did Charles Darwin in the same year. After three years at Edinburgh, Gully became an externe at L'√âcole de M√©decine in Paris, then returned to Edinburgh to take his MD in 1829. Career Gully began his practice as a physician in London in 1830, and went on to write and translate numerous medical books and papers, becoming a fellow of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London and a fellow of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. He edited the London Medical and Surgical Journal and the Liverpool Medical Gazette. Gully showed an interest in the idea of transmutation of species, and translated an evolutionary treatise on Comparative Physiology by the embryologist Friedrich Tiedemann. He was dissatisfied with the medical treatments of the time, and in 1837 met Dr. James Wilson who then spent some time on the continent, and had returned enthused with the idea of hydrotherapy. Dr Wilson was one of the few Englishmen who stayed at the hydropathic establishment of Vincent Priessnitz, at Gr√§fenberg, Austria (now L√°znƒõ Jesen√≠k, Czech Republic) before Captain R. T. Claridge, whose name became synonymous with hydropathy due to his 1842 book Hydropathy; or The Cold Water Cure, as practiced by Vincent Priessnitz... and his lecture tours.

Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org) Note: the prospectus is at the back of the book, with its own preface by Wilson, and its own new pagination One writer states Wilson was at Grafenberg for 10 months. Nevertheless, in an earlier 1842 publication, Wilson acknowledged having read Claridge's work, and unconditionally praised his \\"enthusiastic\\" promotion of hydropathy. In 1842, Gully and Wilson opened \\"water cure\\" clinics, and later established a partnership at Malvern offering a regimen similar to that at Priessnitz's Gr√§fenberg clinic. In 1843, Wilson and Gully published a comparison of the efficacy of the water-cure with drug treatments, including accounts of some cases treated at Malvern, combined with a prospectus of their Water Cure Establishment. Then in 1846 Gully published The Water Cure in Chronic Disease, further describing the treatments available at the clinic. In 1848, Gully became a member of the British Homoeopathic Society.Adkin, George (ed.). The British and foreign hom≈ìopathic medical directory and record, 1853, Taubman Medical Library.

Two more clinics were opened at Malvern.The history of alternative medicine in Malvern. malvernhealth.org.uk Famous patients included Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, Florence Nightingale, Lord Tennyson and Samuel Wilberforce. With his fame he also attracted criticism: Sir Charles Hastings, a physician and founder of the British Medical Association, was a forthright critic of hydropathy, and Dr Gully in particular.Bradley, J., and Depree, M. A Shadow of Orthodoxy? An Epistemology of British Hydropathy, 1840‚Äì1858, Medical History, 2003, 47:173‚Äì194 The Water Cure treatment Dr. Gully's patients at Malvern were woken at 5 am, undressed and wrapped in wet sheets then covered with blankets. An hour later, buckets of water were thrown upon the patients who then went on a five-mile walk, carrying an alpenstock and a Gr√§fenberg flask of mineral water, stopping at wells for the waters. They returned to the Malvern pump room for a breakfast of dry biscuits and water. They then had the day to spend bathing in a range of kinds of baths, or in some cases wore a wet sheet called the \\"Neptune Girdle\\" round their middle at all times, removing it only at meal times. Dinner which was always boiled mutton and fish was followed by a few hours in a dry bed. The exercise, plain food and absence of alcohol together with the congenial company of other wealthy patrons proved generally beneficial. =Charles Darwin= Charles Darwin suffered repeated episodes of illness involving stomach pains from 1838 onwards, and had no success with conventional treatments. In 1849 after about four months of incessant vomiting, he followed the recommendation of his friend Captain Sulivan and cousin Fox. After reading Gully's book The Water-Cure in Chronic Disease, he rented a villa at Malvern for his family and started a two-month trial of the treatment on 10 March. Gully agreed with Darwin's self-diagnosis of nervous dyspepsia, and set him a routine including being heated by a spirit lamp until dripping with perspiration, then vigorous rubbing with cold wet towels and cold foot baths, a strict diet, and walks. Darwin enjoyed the attention and the demanding regime which left him no time to feel guilty about not working. His health improved rapidly and he felt that the water-cure was \\"no quackery\\".Letter 1236 ‚Äî Darwin, C. R. to Hooker, J. D., 28 Mar 1849. DarwinProject.ac.uk. Retrieved on 15 January 2007.

Retrieved on 11 January 2008. They stayed on until 30 June, and at home he continued with the diet, and with the water treatment aided by his butler. When his sickness returned in September, Darwin had a day visit to Malvern, then recuperated at home. In June 1850 after losing time to illness (without vomiting) he spent a week at Malvern. Later that year he wrote to Fox about the credulity of his \\"beloved Dr Gully\\" whose daughter had been ill, and had treated her with a clairvoyant girl to report on internal changes, a mesmerist to put her to sleep, John Chapman as hom≈ìopathist and himself as hydropathist, after which Gully's daughter recovered. Darwin explained to Fox his wrathful scepticism about clairvoyance and homeopathy.Letter 1352 ‚Äî Darwin, C. R. to Fox, W. D., 4 Sept 1850 . DarwinProject.ac.uk. Retrieved on 11 January 2008. When Darwin's own young daughter Annie had persistent indigestion he confidently took her to Gully on 24 March 1851, and after a week left her there to take the cure, but a fortnight later was recalled by Dr Gully as Annie had bilious fever. Dr. Gully was attentive and repeatedly reassured them that she was recovering, but after a series of crises Annie died on 23 April. Gully gave the cause of death as a \\"Bilious fever with typhoid character\\". Darwin kept records of the effects of the continuing water treatment at home, and in 1852 stopped the regime, having found that it was of some help with relaxation but overall had no significant effect, indicating that it served only to decrease his psychosomatic symptomatology. In 1855 Darwin wrote to a friend that \\"Dr. Gully did me much good\\",Darwin, Charles; Frederick Burkhardt, Sydney Smith (1865). The Correspondence of Charles Darwin. Cambridge University Press 13, p.379. but he did not want to return to Malvern. When his illness returned much as when he had first seen Gully he found a new hydrotherapist, Dr. Lane, whose more relaxed regime did not include clairvoyance, mesmerism or homeopathy. After a similarly speedy recovery Darwin became a complete convert. In 1863 his illness worsened seriously at a time when Lane was not available, and Emma Darwin persuaded her husband to return to Gully. His cousin Fox had told him that Gully had suffered a mental breakdown and was unavailable. In his reply Darwin had mentioned having had eczema, and wrote \\"Gully will be a great loss & I hardly know whom to consult there. I must be under some experienced man, for I could not stand much hard treatment.\\" They arrived at Malvern on 2 September, but Darwin felt that he was being fobbed off with the supervising physician, Dr. Ayerst. Emma arranged for Dr. Gully to attend and endorse Ayerst's treatment, but by then the eczema was too raw to bear any water. Darwin had a complete breakdown, and on 13 October left the spa worse than when he'd arrived. His serious illness continued until the spring of 1866. Beliefs and causes Gully was an articulate and popular public speaker and writer. He was also a firm believer in a number of women's causes. He advocated women's suffrage, and preached temperance, due to the detrimental effects of alcohol on the husbands of many Victorian women. Gully built two clinics: Tudor House for men, and Holyrood House for women. He separated the sexes strictly at his clinics, as he believed that many female psychological complaints (depression, anxiety, hypochondria, hysteria) were due to the pressures Victorian women were under to be chaste, ambitionless, efficient, selfless givers, at the expense of their own mental well-being. While Gully believed in the value of homeopathic medicines in some cases, adding a footnote about his positive experiences with homeopathy to later editions of his water-cure book and stating that \\"It is well and wise to observe and investigate these things before laughing at them‚Äù,Gully, James Manby: The water cure in chronic disease, 5th ed.

They are best known for their original recordings and live performances featuring songs combining humor with poignant observations about the lives of gay men (and to a lesser extent, lesbian women) in contemporary American society. Romanovsky & Phillips began their career at San Francisco's Valencia Rose Cafe in 1982, as the musical break for Gay Comedy Open Mike Night. They mounted their first national tour in the fall of 1983. They toured extensively in the United States, Canada and Australia. Over the years the duo released seven albums under the \\"Fresh Fruit\\" label. Sydney Daily Mirror described them as \\"delightful and entertaining Ambassadors of Homosexuality.\\" Originally a romantic couple, the two ended that aspect of their relationship in the early 1990s, but continued to record and perform together, describing themselves as \\"a gay Sonny and Cher\\" (who had also briefly continued their professional collaboration following their divorce). In 1998 they presented their full-length musical, Jayson, at the 45th Street theatre in New York. A year later the duo decided to take some time off the road. While Phillips put music on hold to pursue other interests, Romanovsky took up a new instrument: the accordion. In 2002 he released a solo album in French, Je m'appelle Dadou. In 2004, Ron was commissioned to write a \\"circus opera\\" for Nurses for the Rights of the Child, a group of labor and delivery nurses who are conscientious objectors to male circumcision. After two years of writing and several workshop performances, It's A Boy! was premiered in August, 2006 at the 9th International Symposium on Circumcision, Genital Integrity and Human Rights at the University of Washington in Seattle. The opera featured music written for accordion, violin and five vocalists. A recording was released concurrently. Immediately following up It's A Boy! came the release of Pittsburgh to Paris, marking Ron's return to song writing. In December 2006, Fresh Fruit Records re-released all of R&P;'s recordings. In 2007, Ron returned to the concert stage, this time fronting a four-piece band and performing his newest material along with several updated R&P; chestnuts. The year culminated in a sold-out show in Taos, New Mexico, where Ron shared the bill with comic Vicki Shaw. His newest recording, Turn Up the Fun!, released in January 2008, is a return to his queer music roots, offering 14 original tracks featuring the characteristic satire, off-beat observations and poignancy that fans have come to expect. Currently, Romanovsky performs frequently in and around his adopted hometown of Santa Fe with his quartet, \\"Welcome to Bohemia\\", in addition to performing with pianist/vocalist Charles Tichenor in their annual musical tribute to France, \\"April in Paris\\".

It is probably a complex of more than one true toad species that is widely distributed in South and Southeast Asia. The species grows to about long. Asian common toads breed during the monsoon, and their tadpoles are black. Young toads may be seen in large numbers after monsoon rains finish. Characteristics The wart patterns of the toads are unique and have been used for individual identification in studies. The top of the head has several bony ridges, along the edge of the snout (canthal ridge), in front of the eye (preorbital), above the eye (supraorbital), behind the eye (postorbital), and a short one between the eye and ear (orbitotympanic). The snout is short and blunt, and the space between the eyes is broader than the upper eyelid width. The ear drum or tympanum is very distinct and is at least as wide as two-thirds the diameter of the eye. The first finger is often longer than the second and the toes are at least half webbed. A warty tubercle is found just before the junction of the thigh and shank (subarticular tubercle) and two moderate ones are on the shank (metatarsus). No skin fold occurs along the tarsus. The ‚Äúknee‚Äù (tarsometatarsal articulation) reaches the tympanum or the eye when the hind leg is held parallel along the side of the body. The dorsal side is covered with spiny warts. The parotoids are prominent, kidney-shaped, or elliptical and elongated. The dorsal side is yellowish or brownish and the spines and ridges are black. The underside is unmarked or spotted. Males have a subgular vocal sac and black pads on the inner fingers that help in holding the female during copulation.  Ecology and behaviour  Asian common toads breed in still and slow-flowing rivers and temporary and permanent ponds and pools. Adults are terrestrial and may be found under ground cover such as rocks, leaf litter, and logs, and are also associated with human habitations. The larvae are found in still and slow- moving waterbodies. They are often seen at night under street lamps, especially when winged termites swarm. They have been noted to feed on a wide range of invertebrates, including scorpions. Tadpoles grown in sibling groups metamorphosed faster than those that were kept in mixed groups. Tadpoles have been shown to be able to recognize kin. right  Distribution and habitat  thumb Asian common toads occur widely from northern Pakistan through Nepal, Bangladesh, India including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, southern China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau to Malaysia, Singapore, and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Anambas and Natuna Islands. They have been recorded from sea level up to altitude, and live mostly in disturbed lowland habitats, from upper beaches and riverbanks to human-dominated agricultural and urban areas. They are uncommon in closed forests. Introductions =Madagascar= D. melanostictus arrived in Madagascar in 2011 at the port of Toamasina, and by 2014, was found in a zone around that city. Since its discovery on the east coast, a grave fear has developed that if the Asian toad is not eradicated from Madagascar and stronger quarantines are not be developed to prevent reinvasion, it could have comparable impacts to those of cane toads in Australia.Pearson, Richard G.; ‚ÄòAsian common toads in Madagascar: an urgent effort to inform surveys and eradication efforts‚Äô; Global Change Biology, 21 (2015), p. 9 Because ‚Äì like Australia's ‚Äì Madagascar's native predators have been isolated from bufonids since the Jurassic, they are thought to lack resistance to toad toxins as found in natural varanidUjvaria, Beata; Mun, Hee- chang; Conigrave, Arthur D.; Bray, Alessandra; Osterkamp, Jens; Halling, Petter and Madsen, Thomas ‚ÄòIsolation breeds na√Øvety: island living robs Australian varanid lizards of toad-toxin immunity via four-base-pair mutations‚Äô; Evolution, vol. 67 (2013) pp. 289‚Äì294 and snake predators of D. melanostictusUjvaria, Beata; Casewell, Nicholas R.; Sunagar, Kartik; Arbuckle.

One study analyzed the sequences of the Na+/K+-ATPase gene (sodium-potassium pump) in dozens of Malagasy species that may be feeding on D. melanostictus. It was found that all but one out of 77 species failed to show evidence of resistance to the toad toxin, which strongly suggests that these alien toads can significantly impact the native Malagasy animal life and contribute to the worsening biodiversity crisis in the region. Nevertheless, evidence from one Australian species, the bluetongue lizard, Tiliqua scincoides, produces the possibility that some Malagasy animals do possess resistance to bufotenin because almost identical cardiac glycosides are produced by native plants of the genus Bryophyllum.See Price- Rees, Samantha J.; Brown, Gregory P. and Shine, Richard; ‚ÄòInteracting Impacts of Invasive Plants and Invasive Toads on Native Lizards‚Äô, in The American Naturalist vol. 179, No. 3 (March 2012), pp. 413-422 =Wallacea and West Papua= D. melanostictus was introduced to the Indonesian island of Bali in 1958,Reilly, Sean B.; Wogan, Guinevere O.

The species is now common at Sentani in far eastern Papua Province. The absence of resistance to toad toxins in native snake and varanid predators means that these species could suffer severe declines from the inadvertent spread of the Asian common toad via human traffic, and the currently near threatened New Guinea quoll is also almost certain to be further affected in the lower-altitude portion of its range.Covacevich, Jeanette, and Archer, Mike; ‚ÄòThe distribution of the cane toad, Bufo marinus in Australia and its effects on indigenous vertebrates‚Äô; Memoirs of the Queensland Museum, volume 17 (1975), pp. 305‚Äì310. =An unwanted species in Australia= The Asian common toad has been detected in Australia at least four times since 2000.Henderson W, Bomford M. 2011.

Its membership includes inhabitants of Greece and Turkey. History Several theologic conferences tried to repair the East- West Schism between Greek and Latin Christians: the Council of Bari in 1098, the Council of Lyon in 1274, and the Council of Florence in 1439. They all failed. Subsequently, many individual Greeks, then under Ottoman rule, embraced communion with Rome. They typically became Latin Rite, maintaining their parishes through contact and support from mostly the Venetians. However, it was not until the 1880s that a sui juris church specifically for Greek Catholics who followed the Byzantine rite was built in the village of Malgara in Thrace. Before the end of the 19th century, two more such churches were built, one in Constantinople and the other in Chalcedon. In 1826, Catholic priest John Marangos began a mission among the Orthodox Christians of Constantinople, where he managed the construction of a small community. In 1878, he moved on to Athens, where he died in 1885 after he had founded a church. In addition, he had won two small villages in Thrace for the Catholic faith. After 1895, the Assumptionists began their mission in Constantinople, a seminary and two other small towns, founded in 1910; there were about 1,000 worshipers with 12 priests, 10 of which were Assumptionists. In 1907, a native Greek priest, Isaias Papadopoulos, the priest who had built the church in Thrace, was appointed vicar general for the Greek Catholics within the Apostolic Delegation of Constantinople, and in 1911, he received episcopal consecration and was put in charge of the newly-established ordinariate for Greek Byzantine Rite Catholics, which later became an exarchate. The particular Church of Byzantine Rite Greek Catholics was founding. Much more numerous were the Greek Catholics of Latin Rite, who formed the majority of the population in some Aegean islands. As a result of the conflict between Greece and Turkey after the First World War, the Greek Catholics of Malgara and of the neighbouring village of Daudeli moved to Giannitsa in Macedonia, where today lives a sizeable community, and many of those who lived in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) emigrated or fled to Athens, one being the bishop who had succeeded to the position of Exarch and the religious institute of the Sisters of the Pammakaristos, founded in 1920. In 1932, the territory of the Exarchate for Byzantine-Rite Greek Catholics was limited to that of the Greek state, and a separate Exarchate of Constantinople was established for those resident in Turkey. Continued emigration and anti-Greek nationalist incidents by Turks, such as the Istanbul Pogrom, made the Greek Catholics of the latter exarchate extremely few. The last resident Greek- Catholic priest in Constantinople died in 1997 and has not since been replaced. The only regular services in the Greek-Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity there are held by exiled Chaldean Catholics living in the city. Vocations to the Greek Byzantine Catholic Church are largely drawn from the Greek islands of Syros and Tinos, which both have sizable Catholic populations. Bishop Manuel Nin (titular bishop of Carcabia) is current Apostolic Exarch of the Byzantine Rite Catholics in Greece. Byzantine Rite Catholic Greeks in Greece number were mildly rising to 6,016 (6,000 in Greece and 16 in Turkey) as of 2017. In Athens, the main Greek Catholic church is the Holy Trinity Cathedral, Athens. Although not under the jurisdiction of the Greek Byzantine Catholic Church, a Greek-Catholic community of the descendants of expatriated Greeks exists at Carg√®se, in Corsica. A priest based in Athens, Archimandrite Athanasios Armaos, visits Carg√®se several times a year to conduct services in the Greek church.

In 1922 it merged with its Victorian counterpart the Knights of St. Francis Xavier. In 1922, branches were formed in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and in New Zealand. In 1923, a branch was established in Tasmania. Branches operate in many Catholic Parishes throughout Australia and membership is open to Catholic men over the age of 18.

Overview  Used to support Fort Lewis, Army helicopters assisted with medical evacuations at Mount Rainier National Park on numerous occasions in the 1970s. Army helicopters were also used to insert search-and-rescue [SAR] teams into inaccessible areas on the east, north, and west sides of the mountain, lowering rangers to the ground by a cable device known as a \\"jungle penetrator.\\" Helicopters began assisting with high altitude (above 10,000 feet) SAR operations in the 1980s. Helicopters were also used for \\"short haul\\" rescue operations, in which a ranger and litter were carried in a sling below the helicopter to the scene of the accident. * Elements of 1st Attack Reconnaissance Battalion, 229th Aviation Regiment (AH-64E) The Washington Army National Guard 66th Theater Aviation Command trains at Grey AAF and provides transportation support for fighting wildfires.  History  The field is named in honor of Captain Hawthorne C. Gray, who lost his life during a free balloon flight starting from Scott Field, Belleville, Illinois, on November 4, 1927. Captain Gray (1889‚Äì1927) served as a private in World War I and after the war attended balloon and flying schools, receiving a commission. He then joined the Army Air Service and the Airship School where he made test flights. Captain Gray became a pioneer in stratospheric flight, setting a U.S. altitude record of 29,000 feet on his first flight. He reached higher heights, including 42,000 feet on the fatal November flight on which he died of oxygen deprivation. = Origins = In October 1921 Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jenny\\" biplanes flew from the Naval Station at Sand Point (Seattle) to a grass airfield at what was then called \\"Camp Lewis\\", located at a site just west of today's Gray AAF. In 1922 the primitive field moved forward with the erection of a steel hangar, Hangar Number 1. The Camp Lewis field found itself in competition with Navy aviation at Sand Point, as both sought to be the region's primary military airfield. Camp Lewis advocates pushed for it to be a major dirigible and fixed-wing field. Progress in that direction occurred in 1923 with the erection of a Mooring Mast. This mast, located in the northern portion of the camp, would serve to dock arriving dirigibles. The tied up here on May 17, 1924, as a crowd of 15,000 watched. Shenandoah made a second visit on October 18, 1924, tying up during the evening, following delays waiting for the fog to lift. At noon the next day the navy dirigible departed for San Diego, where it arrived 40 hours later. The USS Shenandoah was the only dirigible to visit Camp Lewis. Weather conditions, with fog and cloud cover issues, favored other landing sites. In 1926, the War Department observing aviation expansion overseas requested additional aviation funding. Congress provided monies for a five-year plan to bring the army air services to 2,200 fighters and to increase the number of aircrews. Camp Lewis received funding in 1927 to build a second hangar. Also, on September 13 that year the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh made a low level pass over the maneuver and training field (today Watkins Parade Ground) simulating an attack. This demonstration of air power encouraged the use of airplanes in infantry support. The new airfield construction was part of the larger permanent construction that gave the camp permanence and a new designation of Fort Lewis. The Fort Lewis airfield housed observation planes. A communications building and photography building were completed in 1933. In October 1933 the 86th Observation Squadron arrived with three planes. The 91st Observation Squadron replaced the 86th in June 1936 as a seven-plane squadron. A photography section was also added at this time. The major expansion came in April 1938 with a Public Works Administration project to construct new runways and buildings. The 1938 construction included two paved runways (a main runway at 6,175 feet in length and East-West at 2,300 feet in length), a boiler plant, headquarters building, metal balloon hangar, six-plane hangar, corrugated-iron hangar, storehouse, flight-surgeon office, and film-storage building. The metal balloon hangar had served at Fort Casey, Washington, since May 1921. Workers disassembled the hangar, placed it on a truck, and drove to Fort Lewis where the same workers reassembled the structure. = World War II = The 91st Observation Squadron and aircraft of the 3rd Balloon Squadron operated out of the Fort Lewis airfield. They trained in observing enemy positions and supporting the division. The Fort Lewis field was renamed Gray Army Airfield on April 12, 1938. During 1940, the 91st Observation Squadron departed and the 116th Observation Squadron flying 0-47 observation aircraft moved in. The 116th was a Washington National Guard unit activated in 1940. With World War II, Gray Army Airfield received 1.7 million dollars for new hangars and improved facilities. As the war approached Gray AAF units trained with ground forces. The GAAF 116th Observation and 116th Photo Squadrons had six observation planes, O-47 and O-49s. The 116th flew anti-submarine patrols. Joining in the antisubmarine patrols was the 123d Observation Squadron activated from the Oregon National Guard. It was equipped with BC-1 and O-46 observation aircraft. World War II cantonment construction involved the demolition of some of the pre-1941 buildings. A number of the GAAF shop and support buildings were demolished to make room for temporary wood-frame barracks on what had been the field's southwest corner. Two of the early hangars and support buildings along the main runway remained in use. One new hangar, today Building 3063, was completed in 1942. This is the only surviving building from World War II and the oldest structure at the airfield. A new concrete apron was added around the World War II hangar. During World War II, the control tower sat on the west side of the field; today an improved tower stands on the east side. The Air Transport Command. 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit used GAAF as the CONUS hub for the Alsskan West Coast Wing, ferrying supplies, equipment and aircraft to Eleventh Air Force at Elmendorf Field, near Fairbanks. Also used by Air Technical Service Command as an aircraft maintenance and supply depot; primarily to service aircraft being sent to Alaska = Postwar era = The Army Air Force closed its facilities in 1947. Jurisdiction transferred to Department of the Army for observation and Liaison aircraft at Fort Lewis. Following the war Gray Army Airfield housed the 2d Infantry Division aviation assets, observation planes, and support aircraft. The 2d Infantry Division served at Fort Lewis until the Korean War. During the interwar years GAAF activities were limited. The GAAF planes participated in maneuvers and training. = Cold War = During the Korean War, GAAF continued in the role as a training and division support field. On the field could be seen L-19 Bird Dog and other observation planes. The L-19 proved to be easy to fly and reliable, with more than 3,000 produced. Pilots trained in L-19s for Forward Air Controller (FAC) roles‚Äîdirecting artillery fire and infantry movement. The 2d Infantry Division began testing helicopters in early 1949 and had nine here. On November 22, 1950, the 2d Aviation Company introduced helicopters, H-13 Sioux's, into the Korean War. Attached to the 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH), the helicopters transported wounded. After the Korean War, the 2d Aviation Company, of the 2d Infantry Division, which had been the first helicopter unit in Korea, returned to Fort Lewis with observation/spotter aircraft L-19 Bird Dogs, and L-20 Beavers, as well as H-23 Raven helicopters. Again GAAF served division aviation assets. The 4th Infantry Division came to Fort Lewis in 1956 with its aviation unit. During the Vietnam War, GAAF not only trained helicopter units, but fixed-wing aircraft units as well. One fixed-wing unit, the 244th Aviation Company (aerial surveillance) activated here on September 15, 1966. The 244th flew OV-1 Mohawk aircraft with the mission of \\"finding the enemy.\\" Reactivated following service in Vietnam, the 9th Infantry Division aviation units occupied GAAF in 1972. The division itself held a day-long reactivation ceremony at the field on May 26, 1972. Army Chief of Staff, General William Westmoreland (1914‚Äì2005) attended the ceremony. The event included fly by's, tactical air strike exhibits, helicopters demonstrating air assault, and soldiers rappelling from helicopters. The 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Assault) in the 1980s developed air-assault strategies with their AH-1 Cobra helicopters based upon experiences learned in Vietnam. They were equipped with rockets, guns, and grenade launchers for close fire support. A post-Vietnam air- supported infantry dominated GAAF operations. This required new supporting facilities, including maintenance hangars and other facilities. In February 1981 a new operations center opened. Three hangars were constructed between 1985 and 1988. August 1984 saw GAAF become one of few test centers for the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters. The Blackhawks were ferried across the United States from their Connecticut factory. The initial group of 14 made the cross- country trek, which took one week, with 28 hours of flying time. = Modern era = During the 1990s, three aviation units served at GAAF: C Company 214th Aviation Regiment (15 CH-47s), 54th Medical Detachment (seven HU-1VHs), and the Fort Lewis Flight Detachment (two C-12s, four Uh-1Hs). These units flew a total of 5,000 to 7,000 hours per year. The 54th Medical Detachment flew real medical evacuation flights as well as training. The combat units also assisted in fire fighting, local disaster relief, and other assistance missions. Another innovative aircraft came to GAAF in the fall of 2000. D-Troop, the 14th Cavalry Battalion, introduced UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) flights. The cavalry soldiers learned how to fly the UAV and learned its reconnaissance and attack potential. In the War on Terrorism the UAV has become a critical and effective tool. GAAF units have served in Iraq with Company A, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment, returning from a 15-month deployment on April 17, 2004. Serving in Balad, Iraq, the company with their CH-47 Chinooks performed transportation and supply missions. The 4th Squadron, 6th Cavalry, with UH-60 Blackhawks, recently supported infantry units in Iraq. Chief Warrant Officer Scott Oswell of the 4th was killed in a crash of his OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopter in Iraq on July 4, 2007. The next month one of the unit's UH-60 Blackhawk crashed, killing its crew. The 4th Squadron has returned to GAAF and has resumed training for future actions. Since 2005 the field has been experiencing another major expansion. This includes the activation of a Special Operations Aviation Battalion on July 16, 2006. The battalion is equipped with MH-47 Chinook's and MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. A new complex has been constructed for the Special Operations forces. F Company 2nd Battalion, 135th General Support Aviation Battalion (formerly A Company, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (1996-2008) & B Company 1st Battalion, 214th General Support Aviation Battalion (2008-2016)), conducts high-altitude search-and-rescue operations. Based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord's Gray Army Airfield, the Army Reserve aviation unit transports National Park Service emergency search-and-rescue teams to and from the mountain. The company inherited the SAR mission in July 1998, when the active-Army unit tasked with the responsibility was inactivated. During regular training sessions before and during the climbing season, the unit's CH-47 Chinook helicopters fly to Kautz Creek near the base of the mountain to pick up the SAR teams. Then the combined group performs insertion and extraction drills at locations from roughly 10,000 feet to the summit at 14,410 feet above sea level. SAR missions are varied. F Company participated in a search for a missing snowboarder on the southeast side of the mountain. Hampered by foul weather and heavy cloud cover, the mission extended into several days as Chinook pilots and crew- members transported SAR teams and flew search patterns, working routes, crevasses and tree lines where the snow-boarder might be. The victim never was found. Another mission involved two climbers who lost vital equipment during a climb on the Liberty Ridge ice face, at 13,000 feet. They requested help by cell phone, but the first Chinook sortie was turned away by an intense squall line, requiring additional flights to drop off and later pick up rescue teams.  Facilities  Gray Army Airfield resides at elevation of 300 feet (91 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 15/33 with an asphalt surface measuring 6,125 by 150 feet (1,867 x 46 m).

Smith II, who did not run for re-election and had held the seat in the Assembly since 2000. On June 1, 2006, Assemblyman Moriarty, along with State Senator Stephen M. Sweeney (D, 3rd legislative district) and fellow Assembly Democrat Jerry Green (D, 22nd legislative district), held a press conference to announce their support for significant cuts to New Jersey state worker salaries and benefits of up to 15%. This effort was proposed to avoid a one-point increase in the state's sales tax designed to cover a multibillion-dollar gap in the state's budget. Significant negative reaction from the state's labor unions resulted primarily because of Sweeney's position as an Ironworkers business agent and treasurer from Gloucester County for Ironworker's Local 399, and also due to his position as the chairman of the Senate Labor committee which controls most labor-related bills, but also because of Moriarty's history as an AFTRA shop steward and stated support of the collective bargaining process.Volpe, Gregory J. \\"Lawmakers urge cuts for state workers\\", Asbury Park Press, June 2, 2006.

Moriarty, who had sponsored a bill for increasing penalties for those making false emergency calls in a process called swatting, was the recipient of a hoax call at his home in April 2015. On July 31, 2012, Moriarty was pulled over by Washington Township police officer Joseph DiBuonaventura on Route 42 for allegedly driving while intoxicated. Moriarty denied the charges. The police dashcam in DiBuonaventura's car contradicted his police report and charges against Moriarty were dismissed. DiBuonaventura was found not guilty on charges of misconduct and further charges against him were dropped when a judge ruled that the Township's police procedures were unlawful. As a result of the incident, Moriarty has created legislation that would require dashcams in all new police cars.

The word was a popular rallying cry in the days of resistance against apartheid, used by the African National Congress and its allies.

Mandla, which is derived from amandla, is also a common first name in South Africa. The Alternative Information and Development Centre (AIDC) publishes a magazine by the same name.  Current use in South Africa  The word amandla is also used when people make a bet, deal or promise; they say the word and hold up their hands with their thumbs up. Since apartheid ended, people have begun to use the rallying cry \\"Amandla\\" to express their grievances against current government policies including those of the ANC. Trade unions still use it at mass meetings and protests. The use of the term has also become popular again during service delivery protests and among poor people's movements. South Africa's independent social movements such as Abahlali baseMjondolo, the Anti-Eviction Campaign and the Mandela Park Backyarders use \\"Amandla Ngawethu!\\" during their anti-government and anti- political party protests. The chant is often used by the movements as a way of beginning or ending a speech as well as quieting down a crowd when a speaker has something important to say. The Anti-Eviction Campaign also uses the phrase \\"Power to the Poor People\\" as a variation on \\"Amandla Ngawethu\\" and \\"Power to the People\\" to denote the need of poor people's movements to control and speak for themselves and not have wealthy leftist NGOs speak for them.

It was one of the three final monochromatic titles that was released by the company; the other two were Navarone and Kaitei Takara Sagashi (originally developed by K. K. Tokki). Gameplay The player must use a 2-way joystick to direct a fighter plane called a \\"Shinryaku\\" across the bottom of the screen, while enemy planes fly down towards it from the top of the screen; they can press the button to make the Shinryaku fire bullets from its nose at the enemy planes to destroy them for 10 points apiece. The Shinryaku can only fire one bullet at a time, and if it misses the player will have to wait for the bullet to go off the top of the screen before he can try again - and occasionally, a flashing arrow will appear, and point to either side of the screen while an \\"SOS\\" signal is being heard in Morse Code. If the player can manage to move the Shinryaku to that side of the screen before the \\"SOS\\" signal stops, he will receive 30 extra points, and the number of enemy planes that have bypassed it will decrease by 9 (but if the amount is under 9 at the time, it will have no effect); if the number of enemy planes that have bypassed the Shinryaku should ever amount to 100, the game will immediately be over, regardless of how many lives the player may have remaining. Every 2,000 points, the message \\"COFFEE BREAK\\" will appear, and will show a girl in a bikini.

Presented initially by Jeremy Carrad and John Earle, and from July 1968 by Norman Tozer. It later featured three female presenters - Janet Kelly (July‚ÄìDecember 1968), future BBC TV newsreader Jan Leeming (1970) and Michele Brown (who later married Gyles Brandreth). First broadcast on 12 October 1965, the series replaced an earlier title from the same production team, Treasure House (13 October 1964 - 21 July 1965) hosted by Carrad together with a robotic hound named ‚ÄòSerendipity Dog‚Äô (a pun on the Terrytoons character Deputy Dawg). Adopting a more serious tone, Tom-Tom dropped the dog (although the series would later feature its own ‚Äòrobot‚Äô creation, Tobor) and was presented as a cross between Blue Peter and Tomorrow‚Äôs World, the Radio Times billing describing it as ‚Äònew, unusual, and fascinating stories and items of interest in a modern and changing world.‚Äô Carrad presented the new series alongside John Earle. Programmes were a mixture of studio items and filmed reports in the Blue Peter mould. From 2 July 1968, Tom-Tom was hosted by former ATV London continuity announcer Norman Tozer, with Carrad remaining as part of the presentation team alongside John Earle and Janet Kelly. Motorsport was featured regularly on the series, with Carrad providing filmed reports from International Grand Prix events, and the series also boasted its own slot-car racetrack in the studio. Carrad's final appearance was on 27 May 1969, making his exit via a magician's disappearing cabinet. Tom-Tom returned in the autumn, with Jan Leeming joining the presentation team. The first edition of 1970 looked forward fifty years to the year 2020, and invited viewers to enter a futuristic fashion design competition. The series continued through 1970, with features including a film-making competition (Tozer would later write two books aimed at amateur photographers and film makers). The last edition was broadcast on 4 November 1970. The original producers of the series were Hugh Duggan and Bob Murray (the show's director). Both left to join ITV in 1968. The designer was Chris Robilliard. From 1968, Lawrence Wade took over as producer. Bob Murray went on to become a well known scientist and psychologist and author of 14 books including the best selling \\"Creating Optimism\\" and \\"Raising an Optimistic Child\\" (both published by McGraw-Hill) In April 2017, John Earle, aged 87, was sentenced to four years in prison for sexual abuse of a minor during the late 1950s and early 1960s at Upcott House Preparatory School in Okehampton.Jackanory presenter from Devon jailed for historical child sex abuse References External links * TV Cream: Tom Tom Category:BBC children's television shows Category:1960s British children's television series Category:1970s British children's television series Category:1965 British television series debuts Category:1970 British television series endings Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Tom Tom (TV series)"},{"id":"3666796","text":"Policy Exchange is a UK-based centre-right think tank, created in 2002 and based in London. It has been described in The Daily Telegraph as \\"the largest, but also the most influential think tank on the right\\". The Washington Post said Policy Exchange's reports \\"often inform government policy in Britain.\\" Policy Exchange is a registered charity. It describes itself as an independent, non-partisan educational charity whose mission is to develop and promote new policy ideas that will deliver better public services, a stronger society and a more dynamic economy. Research programmes have cover education and social reform, energy and environment, Britain's place in the world, economic and industrial policy, housing policy, demography and immigration and security. The policy ideas developed by the think tank which have been adopted as government policy include free schools, Police and Crime Commissioners, Garden Villages and protecting the armed forces from lawfare. Policy Exchange has a unit called Judicial Power Project that examines the power of the British judiciary and argues that unelected judges have accrued too much power. History Policy Exchange was set up in 2002 by a group including Nicholas Boles (director), Michael Gove (chairman) and Francis Maude. Maude went on to become Minister for the Cabinet Office, and names being one of the co-founders as his proudest political achievement. Gove went on to become Secretary of State for Education, Secretary of State for Justice, and Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He is currently Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In May 2007, Boles was succeeded as director by Anthony Browne, a journalist and political correspondent for The Times. In September 2008, Browne stepped down to work for Boris Johnson, and was succeeded by Neil O'Brien, formerly director of Open Europe.Neil O'Brien is new director of Policy Exchange ConservativeHome 12 September 2008 In November 2012, O'Brien was appointed as a special adviser to George Osborne, and in 2013 he was succeeded by Dean Godson, formerly head of Policy Exchange's security unit. In November 2018, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, described Policy Exchange as \\"multidisciplinary, highly influential, a productive force at the heart of Westminster and our political system.\\" In 2020, Iain Dale described Policy Exchange as \\"the pre-eminent think tank in the Westminster village\\". Although sometime associated with the British centre-right, it also attracts contributors from the political left; in recent years contributors have included Labour MPs Jo Cox, Khalid Mahmood, and Alison McGovern. In 2020 it absorbed Open Europe, a think tank working on the European Union.  Units  = Judicial Power Project = Policy Exchange's Judicial Power Project researches whether the power of judges has increased in the UK, and what effect such a rise in judicial power is having on the principle of the separation of powers. The research unit focuses on the proper scope of judicial power within the Westminster constitution, arguing that judicial overreach increasingly threatens the rule of law and effective, democratic government. The Judicial Power Project has been at the heart of debate surrounding the UK Government's proposed derogation from the ECHR European Convention on Human Rights. Policy Exchange's Judicial Power Project has also been involved in scrutinising the 2016 case R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, publishing a number of arguments that were used by the Government in their Supreme Court appeal. The head of Judicial Power Project is Professor Richard Ekins, Tutorial Fellow in Law at St John's College, Oxford and Professor of Law and Constitutional Government in the University of Oxford; the Project Website Editor is Professor Graham Gee, Professor of Public Law at the University of Sheffield. Contributors include Sir Patrick Elias, Timothy Endicott, John Finnis, Dame Susan Glazebrook, Sir Stephen Laws, Sir Noel Malcolm, Baroness O‚ÄôNeill of Bengarve, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, and John Tasioulas.  Funding  Think tank Transparify, which is funded by the Open Society Foundations, ranked Policy Exchange as one of the three least transparent think tanks in the UK in relation to funding. Transparify's report How Transparent are Think Tanks about Who Funds Them 2016? rated them as 'highly opaque,' one of 'a handful of think tanks that refuse to reveal even the identities of their donors.' Website 'WhoFundsYou?' rate Policy Exchange as 'E', the lowest score out of five for funding transparency. Publications Policy Exchange authors have included former government advisor Professor Dieter Helm, economist Robert Shiller, author and broadcaster Bill Bryson, historian and journalist Anna Reid, former Financial Times journalist John Willman, and Olympic athlete James Cracknell. = Building More, Building Beautiful = In June 2018, Policy Exchange published Building More, Building Beautiful, which argued that if developers build more homes in ways that the public find beautiful, there will be less opposition to new housebuilding. The paper argued that this would make development less risky, with increased benefits to people‚Äôs physical and mental health. The report included a poll of more than 5,000 people, which detailed their preferences for the design and style of the built environment. Its foreword was written by James Brokenshire, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and the report was by commended by Theresa May in a speech to Policy Exchange. The Government subsequently announced the establishment of the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission, an independent body that will advise ministers on how to promote and increase the use of high-quality design for new build homes and neighbourhoods. An article in The Economist hailed the policy as the \\"brainchild of Policy Exchange\\" and \\"the biggest idea in housing policy since the sale of council houses under Margaret Thatcher.\\" To feed ideas into the Commission, in January 2019 Policy Exchange also published Building Beautiful, a cross-party essay collection with contributions from politics, architecture and the housebuilding industry, including by the Housing Minister Kit Malthouse MP, Dame Fiona Reynolds, and Jon Cruddas MP. = The New Netwar: Countering Extremism Online = In 2017 Policy Exchanged published The New Netwar: Countering Extremism Online, which provided a comprehensive analysis of the struggle against online extremism. It included a major survey of public opinion which showed that two-thirds of people believe the leading social media companies are not doing enough to combat online radicalisation. Three-quarters of people want the companies to do more to locate and remove extremist content. The report explored a range of policy options for interdicting the supply-chain of extremist content. In covering the report, Con Coughlin of the Daily Telegraph called Policy Exchange \\"One of London's most effective think tanks, which has done ground- breaking research on the emerging jihadi threat\\" while William Booth of the Washington Post said that its \\"reports often inform government policy in Britain\\". = The Fog of Law = In 2013 Policy Exchange published The Fog of Law, which argued that the increasing application of civilian norms to military conflict, and resulting increase in legal claims against the Ministry of Defence, risked undermining the effectiveness of the armed forces and therefore the security of the nation. The co-authors were former US army lawyer Laura Croft and former British Army officer Tom Tugendhat. The report recommended that the government should legislate to define Combat Immunity to allow military personnel to take decisions without having to worry about risk of prosecution, that the MoD should be exempt from the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, for the UK to derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights during deployed operations and for legal aid to be removed from foreign nationals. In March 2015, an update was published called Clearing the Fog of Law by Tom Tugendhat, Professor Richard Ekins and Dr Jonathan Morgan. This further developed the argument that the expansion of \\"lawfare\\" hinders the ability of commanders on the ground to make immediate and potentially life-or-death decisions. Five former Chiefs of the General staff wrote to the Times on 8 April 2015 to support the recommendations, saying \\"We urge the government to recognise the primacy of the Geneva Conventions in war by derogating from the European Convention on Human Rights in time of war and redefining combat immunity through legislation to ensure that our serving personnel are able to operate in the field without fear of the laws designed for peacetime environments.\\" At the Conservative party conference in October 2016, Michael Fallon announced that the Government would follow Policy Exchange‚Äôs recommendations, saying in his platform speech that \\"in future conflicts we intend to derogate from the Convention. That would protect our Armed Forces from many of the industrial scale claims we have seen post Iraq and Afghanistan. Now this isn‚Äôt about putting our Armed Forces above the criminal law or the Geneva Conventions. Serious claims will be investigated ‚Äì but spurious claims will be stopped. And our Armed Forces will be able to do their job, fighting the enemy, not the lawyers.\\" The Ministry of Defence published a consultation on 5 December 2016 as a first step to turning Fallon‚Äôs speech into reality. Andrew Gimson of ConservativeHome said that \\"Policy Exchange‚Äôs work on ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù, as it came to be known, was the UK equivalent of the Manhattan Institute‚Äôs ‚ÄúBroken Windows‚Äù moment, for it drastically changed the terms of the debate, and led to decisive action to deal with the problem.\\" = The Cost of Doing Nothing = In 2016, the Labour MP Jo Cox started working with Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat on a pamphlet which would examine Britain‚Äôs attitude to intervening in humanitarian situations overseas. They intended to publish the report to coincide with the publication of The Iraq Inquiry‚Äôs report into the origins of the Iraq War. The report was put on hold when Jo Cox was murdered in June 2016. However, her family agreed that the report should be completed and her friend Labour MP Alison McGovern helped Tugendhat to finish it. The report examines the history of British intervention overseas and argues that successful examples such as Sierra Leone, Kosovo and the Gulf War demonstrate the value potential for intervention to succeed. The authors contrasted this with examples of Britain and the wider international community failing to intervene in time to prevent mass atrocities, such as the Rwandan genocide, massacres in Bosnia and most recently the death of hundreds of thousands of people in the Syrian Civil War. A supportive message from Prime Minister Theresa May was printed on the back cover, reading \\"There are few more complex questions than when to intervene overseas. Jo Cox was an inspirational humanitarian who cared deeply about preventing violence and protecting people around the world. It is a fitting part of Jo‚Äôs legacy that this paper will challenge politicians of all parties to consider how we can put such considerations at the heart of the decisions we take\\". The report was launched by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown with Tom Tugendhat and Alison McGovern on 26 January 2017. = Clean Brexit = In January 2017, Policy Exchange published a paper by the economists Gerard Lyons and Liam Halligan which argued that the United Kingdom should leave the European Economic Area when it leaves the European Union and that the British economy could thrive trading under World Trade Organisation tariffs. In the week following its publication, Theresa May made a speech setting out her proposed approach to Brexit which incorporated many of the ideas set out in 'Clean Brexit', including that she would be prepared to walk away from negotiations if the EU does not offer a good enough deal. = Just About Managing classes = In June 2015, Policy Exchange published ‚ÄòOverlooked But Decisive: Connecting with England‚Äôs Just about Managing classes‚Äô. The report examined the values and political attitudes of C1 and C2 voters by the NRS social grade classifications in marginal seats in England. The author of the report, James Frayne, argued that these families rely heavily on public services like state schools and the NHS, and rely on a stable economy, low inflation and low interest rates to keep their jobs and ensure their mortgage payments are affordable. The phrase 'Just About Managing', coined by Policy Exchange and now abbreviated to JAMs, was reportedly adopted by civil servants ahead of the Autumn Statement in November 2016 to describe the people who Theresa May‚Äôs government hoped to help. = Education = Policy Exchange‚Äôs work on education is acknowledged as some of its most influential contribution to debate ‚Äì Schools Week wrote in February 2017 that \\"Policy Exchange‚Äôs power can be seen in the impressive number of policies foreshadowed in their reports: reducing the frequency of Ofsted inspections, sharpening up accountability, removing vocational qualifications from league tables in favour of a focus on so-called academic GCSEs.\\" =More Homes: Fewer Empty Buildings= In March 2011, Policy Exchange published a report that argued government should reform the Use Classes Order to make it much easier to move buildings and land from Use Classes A (retail) and B (employment) to C3 (dwelling houses). The report postulated that such a move would result in a more collaborative and flexible development model that delivers both more and better development. In April 2011, the Government produced a consultation document on reducing planning controls relating to the conversion of commercial properties to residential use. The results of the public consultation were published in July 2012. The summary document showed that just 12% of respondents supported the proposed reform of the use class order in relation to commercial to residential conversion. In January 2013 various news sources reported that the Planning Minister Nick Boles was planning on pushing ahead with the reform of the use class order, in line with the Policy Exchange proposals of 2011.  Addresses  Policy Exchange has been addressed by senior figures from all governments of the past 15 years including Theresa May, David Cameron, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Sir Michael Fallon, Nick Clegg, Gordon Brown, Hazel Blears and Ed Miliband. Other speakers include Mark Carney, Benjamin Netanyahu, General James Mattis, General David Petraeus, Speaker Paul Ryan of the US House of Representatives and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

The manga is eleven chapters long, with each chapter being five pages long. When printed in Shueisha's V Jump magazine, all of the pages were in color. When collected in Akira Toriyama's Manga Theater Vol. 3 on August 4, 1997, they were greyscaled.Akira Toriyama's Manga Theater Vol. 3, The series would receive another reprint in Akira Toriyama Mankanzenseki 1 on August 8, 2008.Akira Toriyama Man-Kan Zenseki 1, Adaptations =Anime adaptation= In 1994, the series was adapted into a fifteen-minute animated film shown at V Jump Festa. The film managed to retell the first few chapters involving Ackman's bouts with Tenshi-kun and the first two hired thugs. A few frames from the later chapters were used during the closing credits. =Video game adaptations= The manga has been adapted into a series of three console based platform video games for the Super Famicom. The first of these was more closely based on the comics. The second pitted Ackman against an angelic rock group called the Metal Angels. The last saw Ackman face a flamboyant police officer, and saw Ackman teaming up with his longtime rival Tenshi-kun. Both characters were playable and could be switched between. These games were action platformers like most licensed games of the day, with gameplay vaguely similar to Mega Man. There was also a handheld game for the Game Boy that was a maze chase game like Pac-Man. Appearances in other media Ackman is briefly seen in several Toriyama-related works. He is seen in The Brief Return of Dr. Slump, in the background of an episode of Dragon Ball Z, in Dragon Ball SD and in the fourth chapter of Dragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission.

Amber Pattern The Pattern is inscribed on the floor of a large cavern that is part of a system of caves deep within Mount Kolvir, directly underneath Castle Amber in the city of Amber. The Pattern is a single, intertwined curve, laid out in a spiderweb-like shape. Members of the Royal Family of Amber can walk along the Pattern to its center in order to gain the power to walk among shadows - alternate worlds. Whether members of the house of Amber create the shadows they walk into or that the shadows already exist and that the pattern walker merely enters them is a subject that the author Zelazny leaves open to reader interpretation. Once a walker sets foot upon the Pattern, he must continue following its labyrinthine course to the center; stopping for too long, or leaving the pathway of the Pattern, results in a terrible death. Walking the Pattern is not an easy task. There is a resistance that slows the walker, as if he is wearing lead boots that get heavier and heavier with every step. During the ordeal, the walker passes through several points of extreme difficulty called \\"veils\\" - The First Veil, the Second Veil, and the Final Veil. These points represent intense surges in this fierce resistance; however, \\"breaking through\\" a Veil causes the resistance to let up a bit. Once at the Pattern's center, the walker has acquired the power to walk in Shadow. As well, being at the center gives him the opportunity to command the Pattern to send him anywhere he wishes - across the room, back up to Amber Castle, across the world, to another Shadow world, here on Earth, etc. Primal Pattern During the series, it is revealed that Amber itself is but the first \\"Shadow\\" of a Primal pattern, located when the Unicorn of Order led Corwin to a previously unseen location. The Primal Pattern was guarded by a purple Griffin named Wixer that apparently had also been placed there to guard Dworkin (previously thought deceased), as Dworkin had, at this point, lost much of his mental faculty. This Primal Pattern was damaged prior to the events of Nine Princes in Amber when Amberite blood was spilled on it - the blood of Martin, son of Random (Oberon's youngest acknowledged child), who was stabbed by Brand. Oberon attempted to repair the Pattern, although he realized the process would kill him. Brand, whom Dworkin acknowledged as his most apt pupil in study of the Pattern, suggested that such repair may not be possible. Brand also suggested when Corwin was inscribing his own Pattern that there could not be two such centers of order in the multiverse, and that it would be necessary to destroy Corwin's Pattern before he could inscribe his own. However, Oberon successfully repaired the Pattern, and it was seen to coexist peacefully with Corwin's Pattern - possibly because both are reflections of the Pattern in the Jewel of Judgment. It is implied that nobody could successfully repair the damaged Pattern perfectly, or reproduce it as it originally was - and that their own personality would be inevitably imprinted on it in the attempt. This is accepted - and desired - by Brand, who wished to destroy the Pattern outright and re-create a new Pattern in his own image, with himself as architect of the new Universe: and a fact either not known or misunderstood by Corwin, who attempts to faithfully recreate the old Pattern (after Brand deceives him into believing Oberon to have failed in his attempt to repair the original) only for his new Pattern to not only evolve differently but eventually resist the attempts of the successfully-repaired Pattern to incorporate it. It follows, from this (and from the fact of Corwin's successful creation of a New Pattern, in which he did not die) that it may not have been necessary for Oberon to die in repairing the Old Pattern: and thus that, since Oberon did indeed die, he may even have done so willingly (and known in advance that this was necessary) as a way to avoid imprinting his personality on the Old Pattern at its re-completion. At any rate, after its repair, the Old Pattern (when displaying sentience) does not appear to display any characteristics of Oberon's personality. Other Patterns Through the course of the ten books, the existence of many other alternate Patterns is revealed. There is the Pattern in Rebma (Amber spelled backward), a reflected version of Amber beneath the sea; there is one in the ghost-city reflection of Amber in Tir-na Nog'th; there is the Primal Pattern, the one true Pattern that is higher on the reality scale than even Amber; Corwin's own Pattern, off in Shadow; and even imperfect versions of the Pattern found in Shadows very close to the true Pattern. The latter are called 'Broken Patterns' and can be walked by anyone with enough courage to do so. Broken Patterns allow initiates to traverse shadow and perform magic in a similar way to the initiates of the true Patterns. However the broken path manifests itself in a number of ways. The main example is that the break in the Pattern manifests itself in each Shadow the initiate visits. The size of the break depends on the size of the break in the Pattern and its distance in Shadow from Amber. Broken Pattern mages draw their power directly from the break, similar to drawing their power from Chaos. Each image of the Pattern degenerates the farther it is from Amber. The first nine broken images were negotiable, but Merlin in the course of Knight of Shadows, repaired one - presumably leaving only eight. It might be however that other patterns became safe enough to use after this. The Jewel of Judgment The Jewel of Judgment is a large ruby-like gem worn as a pendant around the neck. As the saga progresses, its importance grows. At first it is just a device for controlling the weather, useful in battle, but then Corwin is told that if he walks the Pattern carrying the Jewel, and then uses the power of the Pattern to project himself into it, he will gain a new level of power. When he does this, he finds that the Jewel itself contains a Pattern, in three or even more dimensions. Eventually he learns from Dworkin that the Jewel is the real source of the Pattern of Amber, and that it was obtained from the Unicorn. Corwin uses the Jewel to forge his own Pattern, when he believes that Amber's Pattern has been destroyed. Standing at the center of his Pattern, he is then able to project himself into the final battle at the Courts of Chaos. The Merlin Cycle In the Merlin Cycle, the second series of five novels in the Chronicles, the Pattern is shown to be sentient. It is able to manifest itself at any point in shadow, and teleport others without their consent. It is also able to create Pattern ghosts, artificial versions of any person who has walked the Pattern. The Jewel of Judgment is revealed to be the left eye of the Serpent of Chaos, stolen by the Unicorn at some point in the very distant past. It eventually ends up serving as a replacement eye for Coral, allowing her to see the \\"clear, cold lines of eternity\\". Reception and analysis Naturally, the Pattern is recognized as a symbol of order in scholarly analysis. Some analysis has emphasized the crucial role that the psyche of the Pattern's creator, whether Dworkin in the case of the Pattern of Amber or Corwin in the case of his new Pattern, may be expected to play in the cosmos formed from it. The Pattern's origins in Chaos have been written of as perhaps illustrating Edmund Husserl's arguments regarding the production of that which is considered objective from subjective phenomena. The Pattern has been analyzed in metaphorical counterpoint to the Trumps, where the Trumps represent \\"wild cards\\" blurring the distinction between perception and reality, but both are sources of empowerment for their users. In popular culture Computer programmer Felix \\"Dworkin\\" Croes, creator of the server software Dworkin's Game Driver or DGD, named the development MUD for his project The Pattern.

The kendang of Maritime Southeast Asia is a distant relation of the pakhawaj and other South Asian double-headed drums. It is the percussion instrument most commonly used in the dhrupad style of Indian classical music and is used as a rhythm accompaniment for various sub-forms of music and dance performances. Unlike mridang, it is made of wood and has a low, mellow tone that is quite rich in harmonics. The sides of the pakhawaj are made with animal skin (often goat skin). The pakhavaj players place the instrument horizontally in front of themselves as they sit on the floor with legs crossed. The players may sometimes place a cushion under the narrower treble face to lift it slightly. A right-handed person places the larger bass-skin on the left side and the treble skin on the right. The bass face tends to be smeared with some wet wheat dough which acts as the kiran and gives a vivid bass sound to the pakhavaj. The tuning of Pakhavaj is similar to that of the tabla - with the wooden wedges placed under the tautening straps. Due to the varied thickness of the skin that covers the treble face, the treble face can produce at least two tones that are a semitone apart. For example, if hitting the centre (the bol ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® din) is tuned to produce the note C then hitting closer to the edge (with the bol ‡§§‡§æ for example) would produce the note C#. The fine tuning can be done with the woven outer ring (‡§ó‡§ú‡§∞‡§æ - gajra) which is an extension of the skin that the face is made of. It is only on the bass skin where a freshly made batter (or dough) made of (wheat) flour and water is applied to provide a low-pitched sound. Etymology The word ‡§™‡§ñ‡§æ‡§µ‡§ú - ' or ' is of Prakrit origin, whose Sanskrit equivalent is . This word is derived from the words (\\"a side\\"), and ' (\\"a musical instrument\\"). It is said that during the 14th century, the great mridangists experimented with the materials used in mridang construction and finally started using wood for the main body as opposed to the original clay. Thus, a new name pakhavaj emerged, whilst the older name, mridang was still used. Technique As with the tabla, the pakhavaj rhythms (or tala) are taught by a series of mnemonic syllables known as bol. The playing technique varies from that of tabla in many aspects. Most remarkably, the artist hits the bass face - which would be the left side of pakhavaj for a right-handed person - with the whole palm instead of with the finger tips as is done with a tabla. The treble face - which would be the right side of the pakhavaj for a right-handed person - is played with varied configurations of the fingers to produce different bols according to a given rhythm. In traditional pakhavaj styles a student would learn a number of different strokes which produce a specific sound. These are remembered and practiced with corresponding syllables. The following are a couple of strokes that are popular. # ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® (din) - This sound is made by gently hitting the centre of the treble face with all fingers except the thumb and leaving the hand quickly enough to allow a resonating sound. The resonant sound thus produced often serves as a bridge to the next mnemonic in the rhythm. # ‡§§‡§æ (ta) - This sound is made by waving the hand from down to up while brushing the top of the treble face with the part of the hand slightly below the little finger. This produces a resonating sound which often serves as the last mnemonic of the rhythm's sub-cycle. # ‡§ò‡•á (ghe) - This sound is made by hitting the bass part with all fingers except the thumb closed. # ‡§ß‡§æ (dha) - This is a compound mnemonic composed of ‡§ò‡•á and ‡§§‡§æ and is thus played with both hands simultaneously on the pakhavaj. # ‡§§‡§ø‡§ü (tiTa) - This sound is produced on the treble face in two parts. Both parts are muted hits and are produced by leaving the hand on the face to suppress the resonance that would have been caused if the hand were to quickly hit the face and taken away immediately. The first part is a muted hit with the middle, ring and little finger and the second part is a muted hit with just the index finger. # ‡§ï (ka) - This sound is produced on the bass face with a muted hit with all fingers of the hand. # ‡§® (n) - This is a muted sound made on the treble face with the middle and ring fingers. # ‡§®‡§æ (na) - This is similar to the equivalent sound in tabla. The ring finger needs to be on the border separating the syahi (black center of the treble face) while the index finger is used hit the edge and lifted immediately to produce a resonating tone (higher than that of the center). # ‡§§‡§ø‡§® (tin) - This sound is similar to ‡§®‡§æ(na) but the index finger is used to hit the ‡§Æ‡•à‡§¶‡§æ‡§® (maidan) - the area between the outermost ring and the inner circle (syahi). # ‡§ï‡§§ (kata) - This is a compound sound produced made by playing ‡§ï(ka) and ‡§§‡§æ (ta) in succession (not simultanesouly like in ‡§ß‡§æ - dha). # ‡§ó‡§® (gan) - This is a compound sound produced made by playing ‡§ï(ka) and ‡§® (n) in succession. # ‡§ó‡§¶‡§ø (gadi) - This is a compound sound produced made by playing ‡§ï(ka) and ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® (din) in succession. A basic exercise that a beginner is expected to learn is playing a theka (pattern) in a particular tala or rhythmic cycle. For example, the simple bols for chautal or chartal ( unrelated to chowtal - the folksong style from the Bhojpuri-speaking region ) in 12 beats are as follows: ‡§ß‡§æ ‡§ß‡§æ  ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§§‡§æ  ‡§§‡§ø‡§ü ‡§ß‡§æ  ‡§¶‡§ø‡§® ‡§§‡§æ  ‡§§‡§ø‡§ü ‡§ï‡§§  ‡§ó‡§¶‡§ø ‡§ó‡§®   dha dha  din ta  tiTa dha  din ta  tiTa kata  gadi gana  Learners typically advance to practice relas (compositions by virtuoso pakhavaj players).

At the time of their demise they were members of the NPL and played at Grange Lane. Formed in 1934, the club reached the Premier Division of the NPL for the first time in the club's history in 2005, after winning the Division 1 of the NPL. In 2013, North Ferriby won promotion to the Conference North. In 2015, they beat Wrexham of the Conference Premier to win the 2014‚Äì15 FA Trophy. They were promoted to the National League in 2016, having won the National League North play-offs, but were relegated after one season. The club was liquidated following a court order on 15 March 2019. On 20 April 2019 it was announced that a phoenix club had been formed to be known as North Ferriby Football Club and approval had been granted for them to participate in the Northern Counties East Football League commencing in the 2019/20 season. History North Ferriby United formed in 1934 as a result of a meeting at which it was decided to form a local football team. They first took part in the local East Riding Church League and, in 1938, they won the Division One title. The club re-formed after the Second World War and was admitted to the East Riding Amateur League. The immediate post war years proved to be very successful with the highlight being an appearance in the final qualifying round of the FA Amateur Cup during the 1949‚Äì50 season. In 1969, North Ferriby improved their status when they joined Division Two of the Yorkshire League: the following season they captured the championship and also lifted the East Riding Senior Cup. The year 1975 saw them win the Yorkshire League Cup by defeating Lincoln United 2‚Äì0. Twelve months later they finished second to Emley in Division One. The 1970s were a very positive period for the club and saw them win the East Riding Senior Cup three times. They reached the FA Cup third qualifying round in 1980‚Äì81, where they lost away to Boston United. In 1982 they joined the newly formed Northern Counties East Football League, finishing as runners-up in Division One North. Promotion to the Premier Division was offered to them but had to be declined because the ground facilities were not up to the required standard. The 1985‚Äì86 season saw them take the Division One title and this time they were promoted. They also reached the fourth round of the FA Vase and the following year went out in the fifth round to Farsley Celtic after losing 2‚Äì1. Three seasons later national recognition came their way when they advanced to the semi-final of the FA Vase, losing to Tamworth, after just shading the first leg at Tamworth 2‚Äì1. In 1991, North Ferriby won the inaugural President's Cup, defeating FA Vase champions Guiseley 8‚Äì5 on aggregate. They also lifted the East Riding Senior Cup for the first time in 12 years and in the League Cup Final they lost 1‚Äì0 to Guiseley. The 1996‚Äì97 season saw them appear in the FA Vase Final at Wembley Stadium. A 3‚Äì1 aggregate victory over Guisborough Town in the semi-final saw them through to the Final at Wembley Stadium on 10 May 1997, where they were defeated 3‚Äì0 by Whitby Town. =Northern Premier League= Russell Fry playing for North Ferriby United against F.C. United of Manchester in the 2009‚Äì10 FA Cup The next two seasons saw them miss promotion to the Northern Premier League but in 1999‚Äì2000 they won the Northern Counties East Football League championship and, with all the necessary work having been carried out to the ground, they finally achieved their longtime goal of promotion to the higher level of non-League football. The first season saw the club set a new post-war record by lifting the East Riding Senior Cup for a fifth successive season. The 2001‚Äì02 season was the club's second season in the Northern Premier League and the club's progression continued with a higher league placing. The campaign finished on another high as the club retained the East Riding Senior Cup for a sixth year in succession, thus equalling the all- time record held by Hull City in a period which straddled the Second World War. The following season the club gained a place in the play-offs via fourth place in the table. Although the promotion push floundered on a tense evening at Radcliffe Borough, that disappointment was assuaged by the club taking the outright record from Hull with a seventh successive East Riding Senior Cup triumph. The 70th Anniversary season, 2004‚Äì05, proved to be one of the most rewarding in the club's history as the young team clinched the First Division championship on the final day of the season at Mossley. The team led the division from early October and, despite a minor slump in March, never relinquished their grip on top spot. The following season saw the club at the highest level in their history as they entered the Premier Division and led the table from the off until March. Despite missing out on automatic promotion, the club secured a place in the play-offs after a fifth-place finish in the table. They defeated third placed Frickley Athletic away from home on penalties before losing in the Final at Farsley Celtic after extra time. On 4 May 2013 North Ferriby were crowned as Northern Premier League Premier Division champions after beating Ashton United 2‚Äì0 on the final day of the season. They were promoted into the National League North for 2013‚Äì14. =National League and F.A.Trophy - Success and Relegation= In their first ever National League North season, North Ferriby finished second, narrowly missing out on promotion. During 2014‚Äì15, the club won the FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, defeating Wrexham 5‚Äì4 on penalties after a 3‚Äì3 draw. Goalkeeper Adam Nicklin saved three penalties during the shoot-out. North Ferriby United were losing 2‚Äì0 in normal time, only to score twice in the last 15 minutes to force extra time. Substitute Ryan Kendall scored his second goal of the match during extra time to put North Ferriby in the lead for the first time during the final, however Louis Moult equalised for Wrexham to take the match to penalties leading to Nicklin's shootout heroics, winning the 2014‚Äì15 FA Trophy for Billy Heath's Villagers. North Ferriby earned promotion into the National League on 14 May 2016, beating AFC Fylde 2‚Äì1 after extra time at Grange Lane in the National League North play-off final. On 24 May 2016 Billy Heath left the club to join F.C. Halifax Town Heath proceeded to raid his former Ferriby squad and recruited several first team players, most notably captain Liam King. On 6 June 2016 The Villagers appointed Steve Housham as Manager, Housham was tasked with keeping The Villagers in the National League. Steve Housham - \\"I am delighted to be given the opportunity to manage in the National League with North Ferriby. My message to the fans is enjoy the ride and be proud that the club are playing at this level of football.\\" On 12 June 2016 Housham added Darryn Stamp to his Backroom team as Assistant Manager, having played under Housham at previous club Gainsborough Trinity. North Ferriby failed to make a push for League football and spent much of the 2016‚Äì17 season near the bottom of the National League and were eventually relegated having spent just a year in the 5th tier. On 22 November 2017 the ownership of the club was transferred from the Foster family to Jamie Waltham. The following day the incoming owner sacked Manager Steve Housham and assistant manager Darryn Stamp due to the previous relegation from the National League and the subsequent run of poor results that left The Villagers rock bottom of the National League North. Housham was replaced as Manager by former captain Chris Bolder. On 21 March 2018 a second relegation in two seasons was confirmed after a 1‚Äì1 draw at home to visiting league leaders Salford City F.C., as Bolder failed to save The Villagers from dropping out of the National League North. = Liquidation= The club started the 2018‚Äì19 season playing in the Northern Premier League following their relegation the previous season. In the 33 games played up until the winding-up order, the Villagers managed just two wins and four draws, accumulating 10 points and putting them at the foot of the table, 19 points behind second-bottom Workington. North Ferriby's remaining fixtures were cancelled and the club was not permitted to finish the season. The club was wound up on 15 March 2019 due to outstanding debts of ¬£7,645.25.

The latter was killed in 1944 at Narva, fighting in 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland. Before that Evers was said to have recruited the third company of the Norwegian skijegerbatallion, which became part of the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord. Leib had broad contacts in Norwegian society. He was versatile and popular among the volunteers. Much to his consternation he was arrested at the end of the war in 1945 and imprisoned at Akershus Fortress. In his defence note he portrayed himself as some sort of social welfare officer and his superior Wilhelm Rediess as an evil influence, although some of Rediess' speeches must have been written at Leib's office. Leib received a rather light sentence, as did most of the German SS-officers in Norway. After serving his sentence, Leib emigrated to the United States along with most of his family and was married, and had children. The location of his wife and children are unknown.

It has a population of 848 people and is located within the Shire of Ashburton local government area. History Onslow was gazetted on 26 October 1885 as a town to serve the port at Ashburton Roads, at the mouth of the Ashburton River, exporting wool from sheep stations of the Pilbara hinterland. It was named after the then Chief Justice of Western Australia, Sir Alexander Onslow (1842‚Äì1908). Wool continued to be the major industry for the next eighty years, despite the extraordinary extremes of drought and flood that characterize the region and are related to the passage or absence of cyclones. Although a large jetty was built at the original site of Onslow (Old Onslow), repeated cyclone damage and the silting up of the river caused increasing problems with the loading and unloading of visiting ships. The cargo was transferred by lighter from the ship in Ashburton Roads to the jetty, then by horse-tram from the jetty across of marshland inland to the town. This led the state government in 1923 to develop a new town and jetty north-east at Beadon Point. The new townsite was gazetted on 10 January 1924, and the residents of Old Onslow moved across in 1925. The new location for Onslow's jetty was better protected from storm damage with the townsite more conveniently located on the coast. On 15 May 1943, Onslow became the most southerly town in Australia to be bombed by Imperial Japan in World War II, when a single plane bombed the airfield. However, there was no damage or casualties. Since the war, the declining purchasing power of wool has, despite consistently good rainfall on the inland sheep stations since the late 1960s, led to a change in focus of Onslow's economy from wool to tourism. It is an access point for Coral Coast activities, such as scuba diving on the coral reefs offshore from the town. Climate and weather During Onslow's long history, the town has gone through the extremes of heatwaves, heavy rains and cyclones. For example, in 1912, Onslow received only of rainfall and during 1935-36 combined only fell. While in 1961 a record was recorded, most of which fell between late January and early March, a result of three cyclone impacts within five weeks. These cyclones brought heavy rain and destructive winds to Onslow, resulting in flooding and damage to buildings. A major long-term drought between 1935 and 1941, during which time only one cyclone hit (in April 1937) and did not produce rain on the inland sheep stations, led to a decline in Onslow's fortunes. A kangaroo in the ruins of Old Onslow =Cyclones= Numerous cyclones have impacted Onslow over the years, the first of which occurred in 1880. On 28 March 1934, a severe cyclone hit the town, with the new jetty nearly destroyed. All the buildings suffered damage, with some destroyed. Another severe cyclone crossed the coast at Onslow on 7 February 1963, damaging nearly every building in town. Destructive wind gusts of were recorded during the cyclone, which bent telephone poles, leaving them parallel with the ground. On 19 February 1975, Severe Tropical Cyclone Trixie crossed the coast near Onslow, with the cyclone's centre passing directly over nearby Mardie. A wind gust of were recorded at Onslow, whilst wind gusts of at Mardie (This was the limit of the recorder, so the gusts at Mardie may have been higher). At the time, the wind gust recorded at Onslow was the highest recorded in Australia.

During this phase, water pollution entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm. Consequently, these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters.Alex Maestre and Robert Pitt; Center for Watershed Protection (2005).\\"The National Stormwater Quality Database, Version 1.1: A Compilation and Analysis of NPDES Stormwater Monitoring Information.\\" Report prepared for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. September 4, 2005. First flush effect The term \\"first flush effect\\" refers to rapid changes in water quality (pollutant concentration or load) that occur after early season rains. Soil and vegetation particles wash into streams; sediments and other accumulated organic particles on the river bed are re-suspended, and dissolved substances from soil and shallow groundwater can be flushed into streams. Recent research has shown that this effect has not been observed in relatively pervious areas. The term is often also used to address the first flood after a dry period, which is supposed to contain higher concentrations than a subsequent one. This is referred to as \\"first flush flood.\\" There are various definitions of the first flush phenomenon.Australian Government, Department of the Environment and Heritage. Canberra. \\"Glossary of Terms.\\" First foul flush Storm water runoff in a combined sewer produces a first foul flush with a suspension of accumulated sanitary solids from the sewer in addition to pollutants from surface runoff. Inflow may produce a foul flush effect in sanitary sewers if flows peak during wet weather. As flow rates increase above average, a relatively small percentage of the total flow contains a disproportionately large percentage of the total pollutant mass associated with overall flow volume through the peak flow event. Sewer solids deposition during low flow periods and subsequent resuspension during peak flow events is the major pollutant source for the first-flush combined-sewer overflow (CSO) phenomenon. Sanitary sewage solids can either go through the system or settle out in laminar flow portions of the sewer to be available for washout during peak flows. The wetted perimeter of sewers may also be colonized by biofilm nourished by soluble sanitary wastes. Hydraulic design is the underlying reason for solids deposition in sewers. Combined sewers sized for peak runoff events expected once a decade can carry up to 1,000 times the average sanitary flow. Less dramatically oversized sewers are common in new developments and near the upstream end of collection systems. Suspended solids may accumulate when low-flow fluid velocities generate insufficient turbulence. Solids deposition is greatest where velocities are low during dry weather. In large combined sewers it may be impossible to attain sanitary sewage velocities generating sufficient turbulence to keep solids suspended during dry weather. Biofilm and previously deposited solids may be scoured and re-entrained during peak flow turbulence. The high pollution load in wastewater at the beginning of a runoff event occurs when increased flow rate erodes accumulated sewer sediment. Erosion of sediments in sewers can release pollutants in concentrations exceeding levels found in contributing sources. The initial highly polluting foul flush is released at the start of wet weather flow during speedy erosion of a weak layer of highly concentrated surficial sediment bed-load. When conditions favor dry-weather solids deposition, the first foul flush may contain as much as 30 percent of the annual total suspended solids discharged to a combined sewer system. Combined sewer suspended solids concentrations of several thousand milligrams per liter (mg/L) may be observed during the first foul flush. Pollutant concentration levels are influenced by the age and condition of the collection system and the amount of infiltration/inflow in comparison to the sanitary flow. Pollutant concentration peaks depend on size and slope of the piping system, time interval between storms, and solids accumulation in the collection system. Steeper sewer gradients and pipe bottom shapes that maintain high velocity flow during low-flow conditions will reduce sediment accumulation in sewers; and periodic sewer flushing of individual lines during dry weather may move accumulated solids to the wastewater treatment plant before stormwater runoff causes simultaneous peak flow in the entire collection system. Related terms Because the reference of the first flush is not always clear, the terms \\"concentration-based first flush\\" (CBFF) and \\"mass-based first flush\\" (MBFF) have been introduced. Apart from this definition, there are a number of rating parameters in literature to determine the occurrence of a first flush. Rainwater harvesting In the context of rainwater harvesting, a first flush diverter is a simple device that is designed to protect a storage cistern from contamination by first flush runoff. This leads to a higher quality of water captured, and less silting of the cistern over time in dusty areas. The diverted first flush water is used for irrigation or other purposes in a fashion similar to greywater.University of Hawai\`i Agricultural Extension. Manoa, HI (2008). \\"Rainwater Catchment Solutions: First-Flush Diverters.\\" Brochure. Although many commercial versions are available, these devices are frequently constructed of spare pipe when the cistern is initially installed or thereafter.

It usually takes place in July over three days.  History  Stainsby Festival was first held in 1969 at the old school in Stainsby village. It was launched by Stainsby Arts Centre, which had been set up in 1967 and closed in 1971 due to council cuts, and was organised by Ann Syrett and Bob Walker among others. The idea of a weekend folk music festival was successful and so continued each year. In 1973, it won the Melody Maker award for 'worst bogs at any festival'. In 1974, the school building was leased by the National Trust to a boys' school from Bradford, who did not want to host the festival. However, it continued after Dot Brunt of Brunt's Farm offered the use of her fields. The 1975 festival was put on successfully without dropping a year, and over the following years the date of the festival moved from early July to the August bank holiday, before settling on its current date, starting on the third Friday in July. In 2000, Dot Brunt died, but its second benefactor, Paddy Lane, bought the house and fields in order to keep the festival alive.  Activities  It has music venues and several family-oriented events, with children's storytelling tents, group rhythm workshops and face painting activities. Camping is available in a field adjoining the main arena. The festival has three stages. A large marquee constitutes the main stage, and there is a tent with a bar that makes up the second, known as 'The Hat Block'. Each year's lineup is varied, but tends to be predominantly acoustic folk. Since 2012 the festival includes in its programme, Earthwork, a series of talks and workshops. There is a smaller tent called 'The Third Thing' hosting multi-media events, poetry, theatre, spoken word and other workshops. The festival usually ends with a procession, often involving the use of fire. In 2005, the procession was centered on a flame, apparently originating from the fires of Hiroshima after the atomic bomb was dropped. This coincided with the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.

The theatre was designed by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff and was opened by Emperor Napoleon III on 11 December 1852 as the Cirque Napol√©on. The orchestral concerts of Jules Etienne Pasdeloup were inaugurated at the Cirque Napol√©on on 27 October 1861 and continued for more than twenty years. The theatre was renamed Cirque d'Hiver in 1870.Simeone 2000, p. 176 The nearest m√©tro station is Filles du Calvaire. History Late 19th century poster for the Cirque d'Hiver The circus is an oval polygon of 20 sides, with Corinthian columns at the angles, giving the impression of an oval building enclosing the oval ring, surrounded by steeply banked seating for spectators, very much like a miniature indoor Colosseum. A low angled roof is self-supporting like a low dome, so that there is no central pole, as under a tent, to obstruct views or interfere with the action. The building was designed by the architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff and opened as the Cirque Napol√©on, a compliment to the new Emperor of the French Napoleon III. The sculptor James Pradier was called upon to provide exterior bas-reliefs of Amazons, and Francisque Duret and Astyanax-Sc√©vola Bosio sculpted the panels of mounted warriors.Astyanax-Sc√©vola Bosio (1793-1876) trained as a sculptor in the studio of his uncle Fran√ßois Joseph Bosio. The guiding entrepreneur was Louis Dejean, the proprietor of the Cirque d'√ât√© (\\"Summer Circus\\") erected annually in the bosquets that flanked the Champs-√âlys√©es.The grand-daughter of Dejean, Alice (Berlin 1852 - Paris 1901) would marry Emmanuel Chabrier in 1873. Delage, Roger. Emmanuel Chabrier. Paris, Fayard, 1999, p. 167. Dejean wagered that evening circus performances under the limelight, with the spectators well removed from the dust and smells of the tanbark floor, would provide a dress occasion for le tout-Paris, and he was well rewarded for his acumen. At the end of the Second Empire, the Cirque d'Hiver was renamed the Cirque National, and was administered by Victor Franconi. It was given its present name in 1873. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec repeatedly found inspiration in rehearsals and performances at the Cirque d'Hiver; Georges Seurat painted an afternoon performance, with a distinctly middle-class audience, in The Circus, one of the greatest unfinished canvases in the history of Western painting (1890-91, Mus√©e d'Orsay). Franconi's son Charles assumed direction, 1897-1907\\\\. Since 1934 it has been the Cirque d'Hiver-Bouglione, operated by the Bouglione brothers and their heirs. The original configuration accommodated 4,000, which has now been reduced to 2,090 due to fire codes. The Cirque d'hiver was the site of the organization meeting of the American Legion from March 15 to 17, 1919. The American Legion was originally founded as an organization for American veterans of the First World War and has since expanded its membership to include veterans of subsequent conflicts. It is the largest veterans organization in the United States. At the Cirque d'Hiver in August 1955, Richard Avedon took his famous photograph of the fashion model \\"Dovima with the Elephants\\" \\"Dovima with the Elephants\\" at the Victoria and Albert Museum website. Accessed 30 July 2012. to show a floor-length evening dress by Dior, one of the most iconic fashion photographs of the century. In 1995, Parisian designer Thierry Mugler held a special fashion show at the circus, to celebrate his firm's 20th anniversary. Performers and special guests included James Brown, Tippi Hedren and many of the decade's top supermodels, including Naomi Campbell.

The club was formed on 24 May 1949 and currently plays in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. Radcliffe won the division in 1996‚Äì97, won the playoffs twice in 2003 and 2019 and reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in its history in 2000. The club changed its name to Radcliffe Football Club for the 2018‚Äì19 season.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45259061 History The club was formed on 24 May 1949 at the Owd Tower Inn in Radcliffe by Jack Pickford & a committee of 17 and became a member of the South East Lancashire Football League. After a short period in that league, the club joined the Manchester League before gaining access to the Lancashire Football Combination in 1963. In 1972, Radcliffe won the League Cup and finished third in the league. Two years later it was accepted into the Cheshire League, which subsequently became the North West Counties League. The first season again brought success when Radcliffe secured the Second Division championship in front of a record Stainton Park crowd of 1,468. After one season in the First Division, Radcliffe lifted the First Division championship in 1985 and made the step up into the newly formed Northern Premier League First Division in 1987. After many years of consolidation in the league, and at times, fighting against relegation, the 1995‚Äì96 season saw an upturn in the club's fortunes, both on and off the pitch. The club, for the first time in its history, reached the last 16 of the FA Trophy, narrowly losing to Football Conference side, Gateshead 2‚Äì1. Under previous manager Kevin Glendon who was at the club for 22 years, the playing side had gone from strength to strength. Kevin is renowned for producing young players and selling them on, in total he has made ¬£80,000 in selling players. Radcliffe achieved its highest honour in the 1996‚Äì97 season, winning the Northern Premier League First Division title by 2 points ahead of local rivals Leigh RMI. Unfortunately, the club's stay in the 'top flight' lasted only one season. Having sacrificed all its revenue on ground development, to allow it to be promoted, it found itself without the resources to invest in quality players to stay in the division. Each year since then, however, it has competed for promotion, finishing regularly in the top six. For the first time in its history the club reached the first round of the FA Cup in 2000, losing 1‚Äì4 to York City in a match played at Gigg Lane, the home of Bury, in front of a crowd of 2,495. Boro again missed out on promotion in the 2001‚Äì02 season when after leading the division until February a poor run to the end of the season, meant that the club entered the newly formed play- offs losing to Bamber Bridge in the semi-final at Irongate. In the 2002‚Äì03 season Boro missed out on the championship by two points to Alfreton Town, and reached the 4th qualifying round of the FA Cup, losing to Chester City in front of 1,138 at Stainton Park. Promotion was finally won thanks to the play- offs by beating North Ferriby United in the semi-final and Chorley in the final at Stainton Park winning 4‚Äì2 on penalties after Chorley scored two goals in the last 10 minutes to make it 2‚Äì2 and take the game into extra time. Boro's Jody Banim got 46 goals in what was an unbelievable season for him. Stainton Park during a friendly against neighbours Bury in 2006 With Boro back in the Northern Premier League Premier Division and a place in the newly formed Conference North up for grabs, promotion was obviously the aim. By November Boro were as high as sixth thanks to the 22 goals of Jody Banim who set an English record by scoring in 14 consecutive games. Boro sold Banim to Conference promotion chasers Shrewsbury Town for a record fee of ¬£20,000 in December 2003, and without his goals the club slid down the table eventually finishing 19th and into the relegation play-offs beating Whitby Town on penalties 8‚Äì7 in the quarter-finals, before bowing out to Burscough in the semi-finals at home. In 2004‚Äì05 the club finished 9th in the Northern Premier League. The club continued to be near the play-offs and solid midtable finishes followed but after 4 seasons were relegated back to the first division in 2007, where the club have remained until 2019. Midtable finishes and the occasional battle against relegation was the order of the next decade after a decade of success and a few cup runs. In 2016 management changed, a new chairman and manager took the reins. Off the field investment was given to the stadium, much needed after many years, a new stand at the Pilkington Road end of the stadium, a new press area and director's area after being destroyed by fire. And a new covered turnstile block, a TV Gantry, Boardroom, club shop, Sponsors Lounge and Social Club. Giving the stadium a fresh new look. The club changed name dropping the borough officially in 2018. Reaching the Lancashire Cup Final in 2017 nearly brought silverware to the new era. League finishes for the first two seasons were roughly the same as before. But with a new manager in charge Jon Macken with Frank Sinclair as his assistant brought some positive results towards the end of 2017/18 from when he took the reins in October 2017. The future looked bright and the hard work and investment on and off the pitch paid off as the club was promoted via the play-offs back to the Northern Premier League in 2019.

He created the website jumptheshark.com and works for The Howard Stern Show. Hein is an alumnus of the University of Michigan where he appeared in the sketch comedy troupe Comedy Company with Jon Glaser. The two also were a part of the comedy troupe Just Kidding. Jump the Shark origins Hein created a website called JumpTheShark.com named after the idiom \\"jumping the shark\\" originating from the Happy Days TV Series.About JumpTheShark.com (archive) The phrase was actually coined by his college roommate, with whom would often contemplate the marker of a show's decline in quality. Hein sold his company, Jump The Shark, Inc., to Gemstar (owners of TV Guide) on June 20, 2006http://www.gemstartvguide.com/pressroom/display_pr.asp?prId=506 for \\"over $1 million\\". Some Stern staff have speculated that the site sold closer to $5‚Äì$10 million, however. The TV Guide website has since redirected the original jumptheshark.com website. For some time, the website was replaced with a celebrity gossip message board. Sirius Satellite Radio The Stern Show staff thought Hein was a good host on Super Fan Roundtable and chose him to be the host of The Wrap-Up Show with Stern producer Gary Dell'Abate as co- host. The show premiered on Stern's first day on Sirius, January 9, 2006, and has received very positive reviews from fans. Hein also hosted The Friday Show along with Gary Dell'Abate and Ralph Cirella on the Friday mornings when Stern took time off, although that show was replaced after a few months by Master Tape Theatre (Master Tape Theatre has since moved to Howard 101 on Sundays, replaced on Howard 100 by the Best of the Week, a montage show with clips from the Monday through Wednesday show). Hein has become known as a fast food aficionado. He has vocalized his distaste for the fast food restaurant Burger King. Hein was subjected to a blindfolded taste test of burgers on Howard 101's The Fast Food Show, where he correctly identified a Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's burger patty. Hein admitted on the August 17, 2010 Howard Stern Show that he now weighed 255 lbs. but refused to give up fast food. According to Hein's book, Jon will not step out of a fast-food ordering line until his food is handed to him, advising others to do the same. Hein admitted on the January 17, 2008, Stern show that he adjusts his insulin levels to be able to indulge in junk food, such as his favorite Oreo cupcake from Crumbs cupcakes. Hein is also the host of the Friday radio program Geektime!, Jon Hein's TV Show on Thursdays, and the Fast Food Show all featured on Howard 101. Starting on March 2, 2010, Hein hosted the weekly comedy The Bonus Show with Rachel Fine on Howard TV. Howard TV shut down in December 2013. Other projects In 2012, Hein began to host his own television show, Fast Food Mania, on Destination America. In his show, Hein expresses his love of fast food by discussing the history of various restaurants, along with how their food is prepared. Hein was a co-host on Loudmouths which aired weekdays at 5:30 PM ET on SNY (Sportsnet New York). The show was canceled on May 21, 2020.Loudmouths (Canceled) Personal life Hein is married, has two daughters, and lived on Long Island, New York now lives on the Upper West Side.Jon Hein at radioactivemedia.com In popular culture Similar to Howard Stern's producer Gary Dell'Abate, Hein has several media mentions in pop culture with the phrase \\"Hit em with the Hein\\". It was initially a phrase by the guys in the back to mock Hein based on his perceived low-energy level as Hein would leave the office to attend to business unrelated to The Howard Stern Show. The phrase was then popularized by, an often on-air staff member, Jason Kaplan. It has been used on many PGA Tour events, in some cases to the dismay of the announcers. This phrase has also been referenced by Jimmy Kimmel during the 2016 Emmy Award show. Based on Hein's statements on The Howard Stern Show, he either enjoys the phrase or is annoyed by it, largely based on perceived intent. Singer Rick Astley produced a song dedicated to the \\"Hit em with the Hein\\" concept on SoundCloud. Connecticut-based musician Jamey Jasta, frontman of the metalcore band Hatebreed, released a song inspired by the phrase on his SoundCloud. \\"Hit 'em with the Hein\\" is also used in later versions of Sony's MLB: The Show franchise by announcer Matt Vasgersian during gameplay.

Hosted by Jon Hein, Executive producer Gary Dell'Abate, and Rahsaaan aka ‚ÄúThe Emperor of Sternthology‚Äù, the show discusses everything that happened on that day's Stern Show with listeners and various celebrity guests. It used to have other Howard Stern employees from their back office sit in on a consistent basis but the platform has since changed. Because The Howard Stern Show is contractually bound to broadcast a minimum of four hours on Sirius XM, there is no set time when the show ends, or effectively when The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show begins. Regardless, The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show now follows the main show west coast broadcast and broadcasts for about an hour. It used to air live on Sirius Channel 100 and 101 following the Howard Stern show but has since changed to being exclusively on Howard 101. The live broadcast airs a couple of hours after the Howard Stern Show appearing to cater to listeners on the West Coast that are Pacific standard time as the Wrap Up Show is live from New York with the exception of Rahsaan aka ‚ÄúThe Emperor of Sternthology‚Äù who conveniently works remotely from his home in Los Angeles, California. It is speculated that Rahsaan moved to Los Angeles due to the birth of his child and/or his wife's career. Prior to 2015, The Howard Stern Wrap-Up Show was open for all show staff members to discuss topics along with Hein and Dell'Abate; however, the show now only features the hosts and a revolving panel of guests discussing The Howard Stern Show and each guest's respective promotions. Howard Stern does not participate on the Wrap Up Show. However, there is the extremely rare exception where Howard will call in from outside of the studio. This has not happened many times as Howard typically will address noteworthy moments from the Wrap Up Show on his live Howard Stern Show broadcast.

Despite reaching a mammoth 101 points Emley lost out to Stalybridge Celtic by one point. In January 2002 the club became a Limited Company and changed its name to Wakefield & Emley FC, becoming Wakefield-Emley in 2004 and then Wakefield FC in 2006, changing the colours from Claret and Blue to Yellow and Blue, and finally severing ties with the Emley name after 103 years and moving across the city to the former Wakefield Rugby Union FC round at College Grove During the period 2000/01 to 2004/05 the reserve side continued to compete in the Northern Counties East League Reserve Division, playing their home fixtures at the Welfare Ground in Emley. However, the league gave notice that at the end of the season the Reserves Division would be terminated due to a continual loss of clubs. This essentially led to the formation of a new club, Emley AFC, who set up to play in Division 1 (2nd level) of the West Yorkshire League for season 2005/06.

Published by St. Martin's Press in 2006, Eat This Book provides a firsthand look into this sometimes controversial sport. Nerz, who spent a year as an emcee for the International Federation of Competitive Eating, has firsthand insight into the competitive eating phenomenon. Reviews Because Nerz's book was released in the same month as Jason Fagone's Horsemen of the Esophagus, and since both books cover the sport of competitive eating, a number of published reviews covered both books together and drew comparisons between them. The strongest criticism levelled at Eat This Book in reviews is that Nerz uses prose that is more sensational than objective. Jay Jennings describes Nerz as \\"more mythifier than journalist\\", and Booklist critiqued his book as \\"basically a book-length infomercial for the organization and its most famous athletes.\\" Despite this negative criticism, other reviewers found the direct involvement by Nerz, and first-hand account of his own personal quest to become a competitive participant both absorbing and entertaining. Jennings commends Nerz for presenting a broader cast of characters who participate in the sport, even though Nerz's book covers a narrower view of the sport than Fagone's Horsemen of the Esophagus. Nerz was able to provide increased coverage of the competitors as a result of emceeing many contests, and therefore obtaining direct access to many competitors that Fagone did not have. The book's breadth of coverage, both in terms of contests arranged neatly by chapter and in terms of the number of competitors, was also noted positively in other reviews.

A mutant with the power of teleportation, he is the father of the X-Men's Kiwi Black and Nightcrawler. His first appearance was in Uncanny X-Men #428 (2004) during \\"The Draco\\" storyline, written by Chuck Austen. The character's name comes from Azazel, an angel from the Book of Enoch mentioned first at chapter 8 verse 1. His origin story was presented in Uncanny X-Men #233 (2004). Jason Flemyng played the character in the film X-Men: First Class. Fictional character biography Azazel claims that many years ago an ancient horde of demonic humanoid mutants from biblical times called the Neyaphem were in an epic battle with a group of angelic xenophobic mutants, named the Cheyarafim. The Cheyarafim were victorious in the battle and banished the \\"demons\\" to an alternate dimension for all eternity. The Neyaphem's leader, Azazel, was the only one who was able to breach the dimensional void for brief periods of time due to his teleportation powers. His only hope to return to Earth was by impregnating women because his children are linked to his dimension.Uncanny X-Men #433 Azazel began mating with women who had unusual characteristics, at least with looks and abilities other women did not have, as successfully birthing a Neyaphem takes a great physical strain. He met Mystique in Germany; at the time she was married to a rich baron named Christian Wagner, who was unable to give her children. When Mystique was introduced to Azazel, whom Christian knew as a business partner, she had an instant attraction to him. Although she was hesitant to betray Christian, she gave in to Azazel and became pregnant with Nightcrawler. While Mystique had actually fallen in love with Azazel, he seemed only to be interested in impregnating her, and shortly after his \\"mission\\" was complete, Azazel left Mystique. Soon afterward, Mystique killed Christian and buried him because he suspected her betrayal. A few months later, Mystique gave birth to Nightcrawler. Due to the shock and the strain of the boy‚Äôs difficult delivery, Mystique lost concentration and accidentally revealed her true form. Considered a demon, Mystique was chased away by an angry mob. Barely escaping, she took the form of a townsperson and, acquiescing to the mob, tossed the baby down a ravine.X-Men Unlimited #4 The child was teleported away, apparently by Azazel, and given into Margali Szardos‚Äô care.Uncanny X-Men #428 Azazel eventually returns to Earth thanks to Frankenstein's Monster's former ally Carcabria (a witch of The Winding Way that is affiliated with Margali Szardos).Wolverine and the X-Men #23 Azazel and his Azazel-like Bamfs side with Kade Killgore and the Hellfire Club where he works at the Hellfire Academy. Azazel also claimed that he took over Heaven and Hell.Wolverine and the X-Men #30 In the depths of Hell, he encounters thousands of worm-like parasites whom he feeds with his blood and thus reforms them as Bamfs in his own image.Amazing X-Men (vol.2) #4. Using his Bamf army and his link with Nightcrawler, who died in the meantime, Azazel begins invading the domains of afterlife - Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory - to gather souls and thus boost his power to divine proportions. However, Nightcrawler strikes a deal with some of the Bamfs. With the additional aid of his fellow X-Men, Nightcrawler draws Azazel from the afterlife and binds him to Earth, sacrificing his soul in the process.Amazing X-Men (vol.2) #1-5. But as Azazel is sent to Ryker's Island in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, Mystique frees him despite Nightcrawler's attempts to stop her.Amazing X-Men (vol.2) #6. Azazel is later seen in Washington, Making a deal with a congressman, when Mystique and Weapon X-force arrive, asking for his help to send them into hell to confront William Stryker. After a brief fight, he agrees to help them by decapitating Sabretooth.Weapon X (2017) #25 =House of X= Azazel's whereabouts were unknown for several years, but he resurfaced in this dimension, accompanied by a few Azazel-like Bamfs, revealing himself to be the master of Calcabrina, former ally of Frankenstein's Monster. Azazel was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of Krakoa, created by X, Magneto, and Moira X. He entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together. House of X #5 Powers and abilities Azazel possesses all of his son Nightcrawler's powers, but to a much greater degree; claimed by Mystique and Nightcrawler to be the greatestWeapon X (2017) #25 and most powerfulAmazing X-Men (2013) #5 teleporter in the world, he has unparalleled teleportation powers and does not suffer from the limits of needing to see or know where he is going. Azazel also seems to have studied swordsmanship to such a degree that he has become extremely skilled with bladed weapons. He has also studied many academic fields. Azazel displays a number of super-human abilities during his appearances; these include: * Immortality: He does not age at all, and can apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries. * Teleportation: able to transport himself, his clothing, and additional mass across inter-dimensional distances. * Paralyzation: ability to generate bolts of paralyzing energy. * Metamorph: can disguise his appearance through unknown means. * Will Bending: ability to manipulate minds, giving him influence over others. =Weaknesses= Azazel could only spend limited time on Earth without the assistance of his children, but currently due to Nightcrawler's interference he is bound to Earth. He and all other Neyaphem are negatively affected by the healing blood of the Cheyarafim which causes their body to begin to break down. He has knowledge of a way to reverse the curse. Other versions In the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" reality, Azazel first appears as a member of the Clan Akkaba.Age of Apocalypse #1 Weapon Omega appointed Azazel his Minister of Death and made him his right-hand man. In the patchwork planet known as Battleworld that debuted in Secret Wars, a zombified version of Azazel is shown to exist in the Deadlands, a Battleworld domain outside God Emperor Doom's jurisdiction that represents the remnants of Earth-2149 and goes by the name of Red Terror.Marvel Zombies Vol. 2 #1 In other media * Actor Jason Flemyng plays Azazel in X-Men: First Class. In the film, Azazel is a member of the Hellfire Club, alongside Sebastian Shaw, Emma Frost, and Riptide. He is the assistant of Sebastian Shaw and works alongside his other allies Riptide and Emma Frost. In the film, he displays incredible teleporting abilities, similar to that displayed by Nightcrawler in the film X2 but ranging over a much greater distance, and hand-to-hand combat skills, assisted by a short sword and a sharp tail on which he impales his victims. He also is of Russian origin, speaking in a Russian accent and at times using Russian phrases, such as \\"nyet\\" and \\"comrade\\". At the film's climax, he engages Beast in a brutal fight until Beast finally knocks him out, and following the death of Shaw and paralysis of Xavier, Azazel joins Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. * In the sequel X-Men: Days of Future Past, it is revealed that Azazel is among the mutants experimented on and killed by Bolivar Trask. In viral marketing it is mentioned that he and Angel Salvadore were killed by Project Wideawake members.\\"Flemyng: Being dad wins over X-Men\\". The Independent.

The club participates in the Northern Premier League, the seventh tier of English football. Founded in 1880, Whitby are one of the oldest clubs from the North Riding of Yorkshire, the club has spent their entire history in the amateur and semi- professional leagues, though they have reached the second round of the FA Cup in both 1983‚Äì84 and 1985‚Äì86. The level which the club are at now is the highest they have been throughout their history, rising up from the lower sections of non-league football during the 1990s, winning the Northern Premier League First Division on the way as well as the Northern League Cup six times. However, the formation of the Conference North/South Leagues at step 2 in the non-League pyramid effectively relegated Town back to step 3. Whitby most prestigious honour is arguably the FA Vase, which they won in 1996‚Äì97 after defeating North Ferriby United at Wembley Stadium. Whitby play their home games at the 3,500 capacity Turnbull Ground on Upgang Lane. The club's colours are somewhat distinct in English football and are intentionally similar to Italian side Sampdoria\\"Sampdoria style stripes\\", Whitby-Town.com, 10 February 2006 wearing a blue shirt with a touch of white, black and red. History =Foundation and early years= The club was founded as Streaneshalch Football Club in October 1880, soon after its foundation the club changed its name to Whitby Church Temperance and played a friendly game against Scarborough on 8 January 1881, which Whitby won 2‚Äì0. The name was changed in late 1882 to Whitby Football Club and continued to play friendly games as well as competing in the Scarborough & East Riding County Cup. At this time rugby football codes were more popular, however Whitby and some other sides proved to be important in gaining a foothold for the code of association football especially in the North Riding of Yorkshire. The most prominent player of the early years was John Nicholson, who captained the side for nearly a decade. During this early period Whitby and Scarborough's rivalry was intense: Whitby beat them in the final of the 1886‚Äì87 County Cup, before in the two seasons following Scarborough beat Whitby in the final. There was also a situation in the 1889 FA Cup where Scarborough knocked Whitby out in the First Round, with Whitby complaining that Scarborough's Recreation Ground was an illegal size. Unfortunately the rivalry culminated in one of the first football riots, after a disagreement about a goal, Whitby players were attacked on the pitch by Scarborough fans and eventually chased out to the Scarborough railway station. Nineteen-year-old Whitby player Albert Drabble, who was attacked at the game, died the following month of a heart attack, though links between the incidents were not conclusive it put a large shadow over the fixture. Whitby joined the Northern League for the first time in 1893 only to return to the Cleveland Amateur League two seasons later. They returned to the Northern League in 1899 and won the Second Division the same season. Again, the cost of travelling forced the Club to leave the Northern League and for a time Whitby reverted to playing friendlies only, a step which put the club into near obscurity. After the First World War, the town of Whitby had two clubs, both playing in the Scarborough and District League, Whitby Whitehall Swifts and Whitby Town. Ever conscious of Whitby‚Äôs more illustrious past, the two clubs decided to amalgamate in 1926 as Whitby United. The new club was admitted into the Northern League and the club's name was changed to Whitby Town in 1949. =Post-war success= The club reached a new height in the Amateur Cup days. In 1964 they reached the Quarter finals and the following year they made it all the way to Wembley, losing 3‚Äì1 to Hendon. The Northern League Cup has been won six times and the North Riding Senior Cup won on five occasions. Whitby were also successful in the short lived Rothman's National Knockout Cup, winning it in 1976 and 1978. In 1983‚Äì84, Whitby came to national prominence when they came back from two goals down to beat Halifax Town 3‚Äì2 in the FA Cup first round proper. They were beaten by a late penalty at Wigan in the following round. The same season, Whitby reached the quarter finals of the FA Trophy for the first time losing to Dagenham in a replay. In 1992‚Äì93, Whitby Town won the Northern League Championship for the first time in their history. Unfortunately due to circumstances completely beyond their control, the club were denied promotion to the Northern Premier League. =First Harry Dunn era= In December 1995 the club appointed Harry Dunn as manager. By the end of the season, he had taken Whitby to another Northern League Cup Final victory. The following season, 1996‚Äì97, the Club went from strength to strength. A 0‚Äì0 draw against Hull City in the first round proper of the FA Cup, was played at Scarborough on police advice, in a remarkable replay at Boothferry Park, Whitby came from behind to take a 4‚Äì3 lead which was held until the dying moments of the game. With only 49 seconds remaining, Hull levelled the score and went on to win 8‚Äì4 in extra time. Superior fitness told in the end. This was to be one of only five defeats in the entire season. The club came from behind in the Northern League race, winning the Championship in style from neighbours, Billingham Synthonia, before completing an amazing \\"double\\" by winning the FA Vase at Wembley, beating North Ferriby United 3‚Äì0. The following season, 1997‚Äì98, saw continued success at the Turnbull Ground when the club won the Northern Premier League First Division Championship by a margin of 7 points at their first attempt as well as beating York City 3‚Äì0 in the final of the North Riding Senior Cup to become holders for a fifth time. Whitby again reached the final of the NRSC in 1999 only for York to gain revenge by winning 4‚Äì2. In the 1999‚Äì2000 season the Seasiders finished 12th in the Northern Premier League and were beaten finalists in the President's Cup, losing over two legs to Trafford after a penalty shootout. The 2001‚Äì02 season saw Whitby finish in a disappointing 15th in the league, but got to the FA Cup 1st Round for the 7th time, only to lose out to Plymouth Argyle after a replay, 3‚Äì2.Whitby 1‚Äì1 Plymouth ‚Äì BBC SportPlymouth 3‚Äì2 Whitby ‚Äì BBC Sport The first game at the Turnbull Ground which finished 1‚Äì1 was played in front of the BBC Match of the Day cameras. Season 2003‚Äì04 saw another excellent cup run halted at the hands of Hartlepool United. The Blues put up a spirited showing at Victoria Park but fell 4‚Äì0 to an excellent Pools side, which contained former Sunderland striker Marco Gabbiadini. Whitby also managed to finish in the play-off zone for the new Conference North but went out on penalties to Radcliffe Borough, a team they had beaten 5‚Äì0, 6‚Äì2 and 1‚Äì0 in the regular season. =Logan-Nogan years= Longtime manager Harry Dunn was replaced by Dave Logan early in season 2004‚Äì05 after a string of poor performances. The former Blues stalwart turned the side around as they equalled a club record 19 games without defeat and in the process made the Northern Premier League promotion play-offs. They lost in the semi-final to Farsley Celtic after extra-time. Town also reached the final of the Northern Premier League Challenge Cup but lost in extra time to Matlock Town. 2005‚Äì06 saw Logan looking to improve on that great first season and with the building of the brand-new 505-seater West Stand at the Turnbull Ground, the future looked bright, though Whitby finished just outside the play-offs, in sixth. A new era started at the beginning of the 2006‚Äì07 season when former Welsh International Lee Nogan took over the reins. David Logan left Whitby Town to pursue a new career North of the border. Nogan resigned in October 2007 after an uncharacteristically bad start to the season for Whitby. Senior player Phil Brumwell took temporary command of first team affairs, helped out by former Spennymoor and Tow Law stalwart Graeme Clark. The pair were awarded the job on a permanent basis early in 2008 and remained at the helm going into the 2008‚Äì09 season. Later, Brumwell resigned to prolong his playing career in December 2008. Clark appointed Nogan as Assistant manager in his second spell on the coaching staff. Whitby finished the season fourth-bottom in the Premier Division, and inside the relegation places. However, ground issues with Cammell Laird, meant Whitby avoided a first-ever relegation in their history, at the expense of the Merseyside club. Clark resigned in the meantime, and the iconic Harry Dunn, sacked from Blyth Spartans despite taking them to the FA Cup Third Round and earning the Northumberland club ¬£400,000 months earlier, began a second spell as Whitby manager. =Second coming of Harry Dunn= Dunn, who brought a spell of unprecedented success to Whitby, returned to the club on 14 May 2009, two days after Graeme Clark's resignation and steered Town to a respectable 14th place. This despite looking good for a top half position before an unprecedented number of injuries and suspensions ‚Äì including three sendings off in one match against Nantwich Town on 2 April 2010 ‚Äì led to six straight defeats to end the campaign. On 4 October 2010, Whitby Town announced via the club's website that Harry Dunn had resigned as the club's manager, with assistant Bob Scaife, another ex-boss who took Town to their 1993 Northern League title, taking temporary charge of team affairs. Dunn had stated that he felt that he had taken the club as far as he could. Despite overseeing an unbeaten three match spell, Scaife departed by mutual consent, after a number of volunteers resented him for taking his full contract entitlement, when he was dismissed as manager in 1995. =Tommy Cassidy/Darren Williams= Former Northern Ireland and Newcastle United player Tommy Cassidy was appointed manager on 20 October 2010. Cassidy, left on 23 October 2011 after a disappointing 3‚Äì1 defeat to Woodley Sports and the team mired in the bottom two. Cassidy was replaced by ex-Sunderland stalwart Darren Williams who had only joined the club in August as a player. Williams quickly moved to bring back players who left during Cassidy's reign- popular local lad Ashley Lyth and two-time top goalscorer from midfield, Jimmy Beadle- plus he also brought in experienced strikers Andy Appleby and Jamie Clarke to bolster a struggling forward line, alongside ex-Bolton winger Jeff Smith. With Clarke netting ten vital goals and Beadle firing six in as many games, Whitby stayed up famously on the final day with a 1‚Äì0 victory at Buxton, Tom Portas netting the winner. Williams secured a creditable 12th spot for Whitby in 2013, followed by 9th a year later, Town's best finish for eight seasons. Whitby ended 2014‚Äì15 in 13th, but after a poor record of 3 wins in 21 league games, Williams was sacked on Monday 23 November 2015. =Chris Hardy= Chris Hardy was appointed manager of Whitby Town on 3 December 2015, leaving local rivals Guisborough Town. Hardy's first game ended in a 1-0 defeat to Sutton Coldfield Town but results soon picked up, and Hardy led the side to survival, ensuring the job was done with a 2-1 win over Barwell. The following season saw Whitby miss out on the play-offs by two points, finishing 6th. On 2 April 2019, the contracts of Chris Hardy and Player/Assistant Manager Lee Bullock were extended by two years until the end of the 2020‚Äì21 season.

It can be seen from the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River as far away as in clear weather. Mount Popa is perhaps best known as a pilgrimage site, with numerous Nat temples and relic sites atop the mountain. Name The name Popa is believed to come from the Pali/Sanskrit word puppha meaning flower.Htin Aung, Maung \\"Folk Elements in Burmese Buddhism\\", Oxford University Press: London, 1962. Geology The main edifice of the volcano is composed of basalt and basaltic andesite lava flows, along with pyroclastic deposits and scoriaceous material, originating from strombolian eruptions which are thought to have made up the later stages of the volcano's growth. The volcano also contains a wide and deep caldera that is breached to the northwest and is thought to have formed due to failure of the volcano's slopes. A debris avalanche can be found to the north of the caldera's breach. It covers an area of .  Ecology  = Flora and fauna = Popa Mountain contains five separate forest ecosystems. The biggest of them being the Dry forest, the Than-Dahat forest and the Thorn forest. The sandalwood forest in Burma is not native. It is located approximately two miles away from the resort there is a regrowth of a planted forest that was cut down in the 1970s by poachers. When walking up the stairs to get to the Popa Mountain Monastery, you are welcomed by the aroma of flowers. The flora includes the yellow, white, and green blooms of the Sagawa tree. The fauna of the mountain includes a mixture of large trees, shrubs, and bamboo forests. Popa Mountain has known medicinal plants such as Plumbaginaceae, Tinospora cordifolia, and Withania somnifera bark. These are all powdered and mixed with a number of things such as honey or alcohol in order to be used as home remedies For example, if you are suffering from leucoderma (white spots on the epidermis) the Plumbaginaceae plant is pulled from the ground, and its roots are ground into powder. The powder is then mixed with the water used to wash rice, and applied the paste to the skin. The list goes on and on. Popa Mountain's medicinal plants were always known as more potent and stronger than medicinal plants from anywhere else. The soil in the Popa Mountains are rich due to the past volcanic activity. They are able to grow a lot of profitable resources in land cleared for a garden. These crops include cauliflower, capsicum, celery leaf, chili, coriander, citron, eggplant, kalian, lemongrass, lime, lemon, mint, green mustard, pennywort, radish, roselle, tomato, jackfruit, papaya, strawberry, banana, lettuce, broccoli and Thai ginger. The dry season is used for vegetable growing, while the rainy season is used for fruits. = Wildlife = Mount Popa has an assortment of butterflies and birds.

Bird watchers that visit can observe birds such as the red-billed blue magpie, the chestnut- flanked white-eye, and the blue-throated barbet. Butterflies include the leopard lacewing and the magpie crow. The monkeys may be the most well known species on Popa Mountain. Macaque monkeys roam wild creating all sorts of havoc on the mountain. Features Taung Kalat Southwest of Mount Popa is Taung Kalat (pedestal hill), a sheer-sided volcanic plug, which rises 657 metres (2,156 ft) above the sea level. A Buddhist monastery is located at the summit of Taung Kalat. At one time, the Buddhist hermit U Khandi maintained the stairway of 777 steps to the summit of Taung Kalat. The Taung Kalat pedestal hill is sometimes itself called Mount Popa and given that Mount Popa is the name of the actual volcano that caused the creation of the volcanic plug, to avoid confusion, the volcano (with its crater blown open on one side) is generally called Taung Ma-gyi (mother hill). The volcanic crater itself is a mile in diameter.Fay, Peter Ward \\"The Forgotten Army: India's Armed Struggle for Independence 1942-1945\\", University of Michigan Press: 1995. From the top of Taung Kalat one can enjoy a panoramic view. One can see the ancient city of Bagan; behind it to the north, the massive solitary conical peak of Taung Ma- gyi rises like Mount Fuji in Japan. There is a big caldera, 610 metres (2,000 ft) wide and 914 metres (3,000 ft) in depth so that from different directions the mountain takes different forms with more than one peak. The surrounding areas are arid, but the Mt Popa area has over 200 springs and streams. It is therefore likened to an oasis in the desert-like dry central zone of Burma. This means the surrounding landscape is characterized by prickly bushes and stunted trees as opposed to the lush forests and rivers Burma is famous for. Plenty of trees, flowering plants and herbs grow due to the fertile soil from the volcanic ash. Prominent among the fauna are macaque monkeys that have become a tourist attraction on Taung Kalat. Mount Popa from Kyaukpadaung road, Taung Kalat to left of picture History and legend Many legends are associated with this mountain including its dubious creation from a great earthquake and the mountain erupted out of the ground in 442 BC. It is possible that the legends about Nats represent a heritage of earlier animist religions in Burmese countryside, which were syncreticised with Buddhist religion in the 11th century. Mount Popa is considered the abode of Burma's most powerful Nats and as such is the most important nat worship center. It has therefore been called Burma's Mount Olympus. One legend tells about brother and sister MinMahagiri (Great Mountain) nats, from the kingdom of Tagaung at the upper reaches of the Irrawaddy, who sought refuge from King Thaylekyaung of Bagan (344-387). Their wish was granted and they were enshrined on Mt Popa. Another legend tells about Popa Medaw (Royal Mother of Popa), who according to legend was a flower-eating ogress called Me Wunna; she lived at Popa. She fell in love with Byatta, whose royal duty was to gather flowers from Popa for King Anawrahta of Bagan (1044‚Äì1077). Byatta was executed for disobeying the king who disapproved of the liaison, and their sons were later taken away to the palace. Me Wunna died of a broken heart and, like Byatta, became a nat. Their sons also became heroes in the king's service but were later executed for neglecting their duty during the construction of a pagoda at Taungbyone near Mandalay. They too became powerful nats but they remained in Taungbyone where a major festival is held annually in the month of Wagaung (August). Although all 37 Nats of the official pantheon are represented at the shrine on Mt Popa, in fact only four of them - the Mahagiri nats, Byatta and Me Wunna - have their abode here.  Recent News  = Landslides = The threat of landslides started in October 2017. The monsoons in early June caused problems. Surveyors say that it is due to the fact that the volcano is composed of soft sandstone. With the heavy rain and the buildings on the mountain changing the flow of water there have been landslides. There have also been problems with deforestation making the soil erodible and more susceptible to landslides. The government is now putting into place projects to consolidate soil on the mountain. There is also planning to put in place better drainage systems. The government is also making efforts to move residents to safety off of the mountain, however, many are refusing to relocate. The residents are long term residents that do not want to leave their homes. Popular destination Me Wunna with her sons Min Gyi and Min Lay at Mt Popa Many Burmese pilgrims visit Mt Popa every year, especially at festival season on the full moon of Nayon (May/June) and the full moon of Nadaw (November/December). Local people from the foot of Mt Popa, at Kyaukpadaung (10-miles), go mass-hiking to the peak during December and also in April when the Myanmar new year called Thingyan festival is celebrated. Before King Anawrahta's time, hundreds of animals were sacrificed to the nats during festivals. Burmese superstition says that on Mt Popa, one should not wear red or black or green or bring meat, especially pork, as it could offend the resident nats, although Byatta and his brother Byatwi who had shipwrecked and landed in Burma. Development It is now a designated nature reserve and national park. Nearby lies Kyetmauk Taung Reservoir that provides sufficient water for gardens and orchards producing jackfruit, banana, mango and papaya as well as flowering trees such as saga (Champac) and gant gaw (Mesua ferrea Linn). A pozzolan mill to supply material for the construction of Yeywa Dam on Myitnge River near Mandalay is in operation. There are many Burmese myths about the mountain, especially the one that said victory for any man who collected their army on the slopes of the mountain was guaranteed. The belief that victory can be guaranteed by visiting Mount Popa is interesting because it shows the cultural identification of life and prosperity with the mountain. The still current popularity of Mount Popa exemplifies the fact that Burmese people still rely heavily on ancient traditions in daily life. It is these ancient traditions that characterize the culture of the surrounding area and beyond. People travel great distances to assure their good luck into the coming years to Mount Popa, host to an immense annual festival which actually takes place in the temple atop the mountain. The festival involves a transgender medium being possessed by a nat spirit which give him the ability to communicate between the nats and the people. It is these types of festivals, the type that are unique to the region but also incredibly important to the participants, that attracts tourists to Burma.

In North America, it was distributed by Atari Games. Controlling the dragon Amul, the player must complete each of the game's nine areas to rescue the princess Alicia from the demon Zawell. Similar to Namco's own Xevious, Amul has a projectile weapon for destroying air-based enemies and a bomb for destroying ground enemies. It ran on the Namco System 1 arcade board. Music for the game was composed by Shinji Hosoe and designed by \\"Tatsuya\\". Hosoe, previously a graphics artist for Namco, was allowed to work on the music himself due to most of the company's composers working on Genpei Toma Den, however much of his work was accidentally wiped from the hardware midway through development and forced him to start over. Tatsuya previously created character artwork for Rolling Thunder, being assigned to the project after taking interest in the enemy designs. The game was dedicated to Shouichi Fukatani, a Namco programmer who had died a few years earlier in 1985 and worked on many of the company's older games, such as Dig Dug and Super Pac- Man. The game was ported to several home systems, including the Sharp X68000, Atari ST and TurboGrafx-16, and is included in several Namco video game compilations. The arcade version of Dragon Spirit was met with positive reviews from critics for standing out amongst other shooter games, being praised for its Paleozoic setting, graphics and soundtrack. Home versions were met with a more mixed reception, being criticized for its high difficulty and inferior graphics and music. It was followed by two sequels, Dragon Spirit: The New Legend (1988) and Dragon Saber (1990). A ShiftyLook webcomic adaptation of the game was also produced. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot Dragon Spirit is a vertical-scrolling shooter video game. The player controls the dragon Amul in his effort to rescue the princess Alicia from the serpent demon Zawell. Amul can move in eight directions and has access to two weapons; a flame projectile to destroy air-based enemies, and a bomb to destroy ground-stationed enemies, similar to Namco's Xevious series. Amur can take two hits before dying, indicated by a life bar at the bottom- left of the screen. Amur can use bombs to destroy eggs found on the ground of some stages, which will award one of two powerup items; a blue orb that will give Amul an extra head, granting him additional firepower, or an orange orb that will strengthen Amul's shots when three are collected. The game features nine stages, which include large rivers, volcanoes, glaciers and jungles. Dying halfway through a stage will star the player at a checkpoint. At the end of each stage is a boss that Amul must fight in order to progress to the next stage. Amul can sometimes find special orbs throughout the game that can grant him additional abilities, such as a homing shot, a multi-shot, and the ability to shrink down in size to evade bullets. The game's opening cutscene shows Amur atop a mountain raising his sword in the air, with lightning striking it and transforming him into his dragon form. Development and release Dragon Spirit was released in Japan by Namco on June 20, 1987, later licensed to Atari Games for release in North America. The game's music was composed by Shinji Hosoe, originally a graphic designer for the company. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). After asking Wonder Momo composer \\"Yudate\\" how to add music to the game code, he inserted many of his tracks during his own time ‚Äî once the development team behind the game found out, he was automatically assigned as the game's composer. During its development, Namco was low on composers as many of them went to work on Genpei Toma Den, allowing Hosoe to be able to compose the music himself. Graphics were created by \\"Tatsuya\\", who had previously produced character artwork for Rolling Thunder ‚Äî after taking interest in the game's enemy designs, the team assigned him as the lead artist. Tatsuya listened to Hosoe's music when he was low on ideas for enemy or background designs. Hosoe's music was accidentally wiped from the hardware around midway through the development process, forcing him to start over again. After the first set of arcade boards were released, Hosoe remade the game's music in hopes it could be reused for a re-issue of the hardware, however his idea was scrapped by Namco due to high production costs. In North America and Europe, Dragon Spirit was ported to several home consoles and computers, including the Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC. In Japan, Namco ported the game to the Sharp X68000 and PC- Engine, the latter being published in North America by NEC for the TurboGrafx-16. Dragon Spirit is included in several Namco video game compilations, such as Namco Museum Vol. 5 (1997), Namco Museum 50th Anniversary (2005), Namco Museum Virtual Arcade (2008) and Namco Museum Essentials (2009). The TurboGrafx-16 conversion was digitally re-released onto the Wii Virtual Console in 2007, while the arcade version was released in 2009 exclusively in Japan. A version for Japanese mobile phones was released in 2003. Reception Dragon Spirit was met with a positive response from critics, who praised its graphics, music and Paleozoic setting, and for standing out among other similar games during the time. In Japan, Game Machine listed the game on their July 15, 1987 issue as being the sixth most- successful table arcade unit of the year. Allgame praised its \\"gorgeous graphics\\" and soundtrack, and for being unique compared to other games of its genre, while German magazine Power Play praised its interesting gameplay mechanics, notably the double-head powerup, and for its captivating gameplay. Computer & Video Games praised the game's addictive gameplay and soundtrack, saying it lives up to games such as Galaxian and Galaga. Japanese publication Gamest called it a \\"Namco shooting masterpiece\\" for its graphics, realism and soundtrack, awarding it the 5th \\"Grand Prize\\", 2nd \\"Best Ending\\" and 5th \\"Player Popularity\\" awards in 1998. In a retrospective review, Hardcore Gaming 101 praised the game's graphics, challenging gameplay and iconic opening cutscene. Reviewing the TurboGrafx-16 conversion, IGN praised the game's vibrant graphics, unique setting and challenge, recommending the title to fans of Xevious and other similar vertical-scrolling shooters, while Eurogamer liked its lack of a one-hit player kill and colorful visuals. Nintendo Life was the most critical of the conversion, disliking its sudden difficulty spike towards the end and inferior quality compared to the arcade version. They also unfavorably compared it to Super Star Soldier, only recommending it to hardcore fans of the genre. Famitsu awarded the PC-Engine port the \\"Gold Hall of Fame\\" award for its gameplay and strategy. Sequels and legacy A sequel game, Dragon Spirit: The New Legend, was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989 and published outside Japan by Bandai. Taking place several years after the events of the original, it adds many of the levels from the arcade version alongside new stages, enemies, boss fights and cinematic cutscenes, alongside a brand-new storyline. A second sequel Dragon Saber, was released for arcades in 1990 exclusively in Japan, running on the Namco System 2 arcade board. Subtitled After Story of Dragon Spirit, this game adds two-player co-operative play, charging shots and new enemy types. A PC- Engine version was released a year later in 1991, while the arcade version was released as part of the Japan-only Namco Museum Encore compilation. The PC- Engine conversion was released for the Japanese Wii Virtual Console in 2008, followed by the arcade version in 2009. Amul appears as a playable character in the WonderSwan Color role-playing game Namco Super Wars, alongside Princess Alicia. Several players in the Family Stadium series would be named after Amul and the game itself. In 2012, a webcomic adaptation of Dragon Spirit was created for ShiftyLook a subsidiary of Namco Bandai Games that focused on reviving older Namco game franchises for use in comics and animations. Illustrated by artist Steve Cummings, the comic was a tongue'n cheek parody of the \\"damsel in distress\\" storyline used in fiction, featuring characters and settings taken from the arcade game. Nidia, a character from the webcomic, appeared as a character the player could date in the now-defunct browser game Namco High.

It is considered the best of horses, prototype and king of horses. Uchchaihshravas is often described as a vahana (\\"vehicle\\") of Surya - the Sun-God, but is also recorded to be the horse of Bali, the king of Asuras. Uchchaihshravas is said to be snow white in colour. Legends and textual references The Mahabharata mentions that Uchchaihshravas rose from the Samudra manthan (\\"churning of the milk ocean\\") and Indra--the god-king of heaven--seized it and made it his vehicle (vahana). He rose from the ocean along with other treasures like goddess Lakshmi - the goddess of fortune, taken by god Vishnu as his consort and the amritathe elixir of life. The legend of Uchchaihshravas, rising from the milk ocean also appears in the Vishnu Purana, the Ramayana, the Matsya Purana, the Vayu Purana etc. While various scriptures give different lists of treasures (ratnas) of those appeared from the churning of the milk ocean, most of them agree that Uchchaihshravas was one of them. A seven-headed winged Uchchaihshravas with other treasures from Samudra manthan. Uchchaihshravas is also mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita (10.27, which is part of the Mahabharata), a discourse by god Krishna--an avatar of Vishnu--to Arjuna. When Krishna declares himself to be the source of the universe, he declares that among horses, he is Uchchaihshravas--he who is born from the amrita. The twelfth-century Hariharacaturanga records once Brahma, the creator-god, performed a sacrifice, out of which rose a winged white horse called Uchchaihshravas. Uchchaihshravas again rose out of the cosmic Ocean of Milk and was taken by the king of the demons (Asura) Bali, who used it to attain many impossible things. The Vishnu Purana records when Prithu was installed as the first king on earth, others were also given kingship responsibilities. Uchchaihshravas was then made the king of horses. The Mahabharata also mentions about a bet between sisters and wives of Kashyapa - Vinata and Kadru about the colour of Uchchaihshravas's tail. While Vinata--the mother of Garuda and Aruna--said it was white, Kadru said it was black. The loser would have to become a servant of the winner. Kadru told her Naga (\\"serpent\\") sons to cover the tail of the horse and thus make it appear as black in colour and thus, Kadru won. The Kumarasambhava by Kalidasa, narrates that Uchchaihshravas, the best of horses and symbol of Indra's glory, was robbed by the demon Tarakasura from heaven. Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates that once Revanta, the sun god Surya's son, came to Vishnu's abode, riding Uchchaihshravas. Seeing Uchchaihshravas, her brother's brilliant form, Lakshmi was mesmerized and ignored a question asked by Vishnu. Suspecting that Lakshmi lusted for Uchchaihshravas and thus ignored him, Vishnu cursed her to be born as a mare in her next birth. As a mare, Lakshmi meditated for a thousand years and pleased Shiva, who sent Vishnu to the earth in the form of a horse. A baby boy was born to Vishnu and Lakshmi, after which they returned to Vaikuntha. The boy was adopted by King Satyajit of the Yadava Dynasty and named Ekavira. He was also called Hehaya (born of a horse) and became the founder of the famous Haihaya Dynasty. It was in this dynasty that the great warrior Kartaveerya Arjuna was born.

The relation is created between the original subject and a new term that represents the property expressed by the original predicate. Hypostasis changes a propositional formula of the form X is Y to another one of the form X has the property of being Y or X has Y-ness. The logical functioning of the second object Y-ness consists solely in the truth-values of those propositions that have the corresponding abstract property Y as the predicate. The object of thought introduced in this way may be called a hypostatic object and in some senses an abstract object and a formal object. The above definition is adapted from the one given by Charles Sanders Peirce (CP 4.235, \\"The Simplest Mathematics\\" (1902), in Collected Papers, CP 4.227‚Äì323). As Peirce describes it, the main point about the formal operation of hypostatic abstraction, insofar as it operates on formal linguistic expressions, is that it converts a predicative adjective or predicate into an extra subject, thus increasing by one the number of \\"subject\\" slots‚Äîcalled the arity or adicity‚Äîof the main predicate. The transformation of \\"honey is sweet\\" into \\"honey possesses sweetness\\" can be viewed in several ways: 400px The grammatical trace of this hypostatic transformation is a process that extracts the adjective \\"sweet\\" from the predicate \\"is sweet\\", replacing it by a new, increased-arity predicate \\"possesses\\", and as a by-product of the reaction, as it were, precipitating out the substantive \\"sweetness\\" as a second subject of the new predicate. The abstraction of hypostasis takes the concrete physical sense of \\"taste\\" found in \\"honey is sweet\\" and gives it formal metaphysical characteristics in \\"honey has sweetness\\".

Gameplay Screenshot of the game As in the original Dragon Spirit, players must take control of a prince transformed into a dragon by a flash of lightning: the first controls \\"Huey\\" (blue) and the second player controls \\"Siria\\" (red), which means that two players can now play simultaneously; Huey also looks like an 8192-colour version of Prince Amul from the original game, and both players can now press and hold their Firing Buttons to make their dragons spit flames continuously (and, if they wait for a few seconds without pressing them, charge their shots). Several new enemies and powerups have also been introduced - and, much like in Phelios, Huey and Siria can take up to four hits before dying (depending on what the arcade operators set the \\"LIFE\\" option to), which means that if they have set it to \\"1\\" they will die immediately when they get hit. Also (for the US version), if the arcade operators have set the \\"LEFT\\" option to \\"S\\", the number of lives the players start out with depends on how many coins they insert into the cabinet (one coin for one life, and two coins for three); the game's title screen will also display this information below its name (instead of the game's full title) as a result of this setting being in effect. Development Dragon Saber was the creation of Namco artist Yoshihiro Sugiyama, being his first time as a planner for a game. Sugiyama wanted the game to feel like a true continuation of its predecessor Dragon Spirit in terms of its storyline and world, as he felt the NES sequel Dragon Spirit: The New Legend was mostly just a rehash of the original and had a rather generic premise. He also wanted the game to appeal to anyone instead of mostly hardcore shooter enthusiasts, and one that many could find a degree of satisfaction in. Once the story was completed, Sugiyama began work on the game's lore and fictional world, wanting it to be one that players hadn't seen before in similar games beforehand. Ports There were three ports of this arcade game in Japan; the first was for the PC Engine in 1991, which was exclusive to Japan. The second was a part of the Namco Museum Encore compilation for the Sony PlayStation that was released in 1997 (however, unlike the previous Namco Museum titles, this one never got released outside Japan), and the third was the Virtual Console Arcade release in 2008 (of the PC Engine version) and 2009 (of the original arcade version), which was also exclusive to Japan.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Dragon Saber on their January 1, 1991 issue as being the most-successful table arcade game of the year.

History He grew up in Kungsholmen in Stockholm, where there now is a street named after him. His father was a Social Democratic politician and Carl-Gustaf started his acting in a socialist youth theater club. From the 1940s, he was associated at the Casinorevyn ensemble at Casinoteatern on Bryggargatan in Stockholm. Lindstedt quickly became one of the crowd favorites at the theater. Here he met Arne Kallerud (1913-1981), who became Lindstedt's stage partner in many revues, films and radio shows. Their radio series became a success in the late 1950s. In 1957, Lindstedt and Kallerud started their own theater: N√∂jeskatten at S√∂dermalm, Stockholm. They operated the theater until the mid-1960s. Lindstedt is mostly known for being a comedian but he has also been in many dramas. His films include What Are You Doing After the Orgy? and The Man on the Roof where he played the detective Martin Beck.

Chess career  He was one of the strongest junior chess players in the Soviet Union in the late 60s, qualified for the World Juniors in 1967 ahead of Karpov, Balashov and other very strong players, and was subsequently denied his shot at the title by the fact that the event was held in Israel, which at the time was a no-fly zone for Soviet sportsmen. Since then his career failed to live up to the earlier promise, but he still became an International Master and won five Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) championships, which at the time were equal in strength to a national championship of an average European country, with many titled players taking part. He combined his chess playing with a nine to five job as an engineer. Andrei went into coaching in the late 1980s and since then helped many young chess players in Saint Petersburg, leading Konstantin Sakaev to a World Junior title. In 1993 he started to work with Peter Svidler, who credits him as the biggest influence in his career.

It covers and includes the Stone of Hope, a granite statue of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. carved by sculptor Lei Yixin. The inspiration for the memorial design is a line from King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech: \\"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\\" The memorial opened to the public on August 22, 2011, after more than two decades of planning, fund-raising, and construction. This national memorial is the 395th unit in the United States National Park Service. The monumental memorial is located at the northwest corner of the Tidal Basin near the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, on a sightline linking the Lincoln Memorial to the northwest and the Jefferson Memorial to the southeast. The official address of the monument, 1964 Independence Avenue, S.W., commemorates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A ceremony dedicating the memorial was scheduled for Sunday, August 28, 2011, the 48th anniversary of the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech that Martin Luther King Jr. delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 but was postponed until October 16 (the 16th anniversary of the 1995 Million Man March on the National Mall) due to Hurricane Irene. Although this is not the first memorial to an African American in Washington, D.C., King is the first African American honored with a memorial on or near the National Mall and only the fourth non-President to be memorialized in such a way. The King Memorial is administered by the National Park Service (NPS). Context Washington, D.C. Civil Rights March. Martin Luther King Jr. (January 15, 1929 ‚Äì April 4, 1968), an American clergyman, activist, and prominent leader in the Civil Rights Movement, was an iconic figure in the advancement of civil rights in the United States and around the world, and advocated for using nonviolent resistance, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. Although during his life he was monitored by the FBI for presumed communist sympathies, King is now presented as a heroic leader in the history of modern American liberalism. At the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, King imagined an end to racial inequality in his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. This speech has been canonized as one of the greatest pieces of American oratory. In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other nonviolent means. At the time of his death, he had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and stopping the Vietnam War. King was backing the Memphis Sanitation Strike and organizing a mass occupation of Washington, D.C. ‚Äì the Poor People's CampaignHoney, Michael K. Going Down Jericho Road: The Memphis strike, Martin Luther King's last campaign. New York: Norton, 2007. . ‚Äì when he was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. Vision statement The official vision statement for the King Memorial notes: Harry E. Johnson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the memorial foundation, added these words in a letter posted on the memorial's website: Project proposal Memorial site, shown in relation to areas including the National Mall, West Potomac Park, and the Tidal Basin The memorial is a result of an early effort of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. to erect a monument to King. King was a member of the fraternity, initiated into the organization via Sigma Chapter on June 22, 1952, while he was attending Boston University completing his doctoral studies. King remained involved with the fraternity after the completion of his studies, including delivering the keynote speech at the fraternity's 50th anniversary banquet in 1956. In 1968, after King's assassination, Alpha Phi Alpha proposed erecting a permanent memorial to King in Washington, D.C. The fraternity's efforts gained momentum in 1986, the first year King's birthday was celebrated as the federal holiday of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. In 1996, the United States Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to permit Alpha Phi Alpha to establish a memorial on Department of Interior lands in the District of Columbia, giving the fraternity until November 2003 to raise $100 million and break ground. In 1998, Congress authorized the fraternity to establish a nonprofit foundationthe Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation, Inc.to manage the memorial's fundraising and design, and approved the building of the memorial on the National Mall. In 1999, the United States Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) and the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) approved the site location for the memorial. The memorial's design, by ROMA Design Group, a San Francisco-based architecture firm, was selected out of 900 candidates from 52 countries. On December 4, 2000, a marble and bronze plaque was laid by Alpha Phi Alpha to dedicate the site where the memorial was to be built. Soon thereafter, a full-time fundraising team began the fundraising and promotional campaign for the memorial. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the memorial was held on November 13, 2006, in West Potomac Park. In August 2008, the foundation's leaders estimated the memorial would take 20 months to complete with a total cost of $120 million USD. As of December 2008, the foundation had raised approximately $108 million, including substantial contributions from such donors as General Motors, Tommy Hilfiger, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Walt Disney Company Foundation, the NBA, NFL Players Association, National Association of Realtors, and filmmakers George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. The figure also includes $10 million in matching funds provided by the United States Congress. In October 2009, the memorial's final project was approved by federal agencies and a building permit was issued. Construction began in December 2009 and was expected to take 20 months to complete. The foundation conducted a press tour on December 1, 2010, as the \\"Stone of Hope\\" was nearing completion. At that time only $108 million of the $120 million project cost had been raised. Description =Location= The street address for the memorial is 1964 Independence Avenue SW in Washington, D.C. The address \\"1964\\" was chosen as a direct reference to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a milestone in the Civil Rights Movement in which King played an important role. The memorial is located on a site in West Potomac Park that borders the Tidal Basin, southwest of the National Mall. The memorial is near the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial and is intended to create a visual \\"line of leadership\\" from the Lincoln Memorial, on whose steps King gave his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech at the March on Washington, to the Jefferson Memorial. =Structure= The centerpiece for the memorial is based on a line from King's \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech: \\"Out of the mountain of despair, a stone of hope.\\" A -high relief of King named the Stone of Hope stands past two other pieces of granite that symbolize the \\"mountain of despair.\\" Pale pink granite was used to create the Stone of Hope to ensure that the carving's details would be visible at night, and to contrast with the Mountain of Despair. Visitors figuratively \\"pass through\\" the Mountain of Despair on the way to the Stone of Hope, symbolically \\"moving through the struggle as Dr. King did during his life.\\" A -long inscription wall includes excerpts from many of King's sermons and speeches. On this crescent-shaped granite wall, fourteen of King's quotes are inscribed, the earliest from the time of the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama, and the latest from his final sermon, delivered in 1968 at Washington, D.C.'s National Cathedral, just four days before his assassination. The relief of King is intended to give the impression that he is looking over the Tidal Basin toward the horizon, and that the cherry trees that adorn the site will bloom every year during the anniversary of King's death. =Precedence= This memorial is not the first in Washington, D.C., to honor an African American, as it was preceded by a memorial to Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, who also served as an unofficial advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A -tall bronze statue of her is located in Lincoln Park, East Capitol St. and 12th St., NE. The King Memorial is the first memorial to an African American on or near the National Mall. The memorial is not the first to honor a non-United States president on or near the National Mall, as it was preceded by three other such memorials: the John Paul Jones Memorial, erected in 1912 near the Tidal Basin in memory of John Paul Jones, the Scottish-born American naval hero who served during the American Revolution; the John Ericsson Memorial, authorized in 1916 to honor John Ericsson, the Swedish-born engineer and inventor who designed the during the Civil War; and the George Mason Memorial, authorized in 1990 to honor George Mason, author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights (the basis for the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights), near the Thomas Jefferson Memorial. =Inscriptions= The Inscription Wall Fourteen quotes from King's speeches, sermons, and writings are inscribed on the Inscription Wall. The \\"Council of Historians\\" created to choose the quotations included Maya Angelou, Lerone Bennett, Clayborne Carson, Henry Louis Gates, Marianne Williamson and others, though the memorial's executive architect stated that Maya Angelou did not attend the meetings at which the quotations were selected. According to the official National Park Service brochure for the Memorial, the inscriptions that were chosen \\"stress four primary messages of Dr. King: justice, democracy, hope, and love.\\"\\"Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, official brochure prepared by the National Mall and Memorial Parks, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. The earliest quote is from 1955, spoken during the time of the Montgomery bus boycott, and the latest is from a sermon King delivered at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., four days before he was assassinated. The quotes are not arranged in chronological order, so that no visitor must follow a set path to follow the quotations, instead being able to start reading at any point he or she might choose. Because the main theme of the Memorial is linked to King's famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, none of the quotations on the Inscription Wall come from that speech. The selection of quotes was announced at a special event at the National Building Museum on February 9, 2007 (at the same time the identity of the sculptor was revealed). The fourteen quotes on the Inscription Wall are: * \\"We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\\" (March 31, 1968, National Cathedral, Washington, D.C.) * \\"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.\\" (1963, Strength to Love) * \\"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.\\" (December 10, 1964, Oslo, Norway) * \\"Make a career of humanity. Commit yourself to the noble struggle for equal rights. You will make a greater person of yourself, a greater nation of your country, and a finer world to live in.\\" (April 18, 1959, Washington, D.C.) * \\"I oppose the war in Vietnam because I love America. I speak out against it not in anger but with anxiety and sorrow in my heart, and above all with a passionate desire to see our beloved country stand as a moral example of the world.\\" (February 25, 1967, Los Angeles, California) * \\"If we are to have peace on earth, our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class, and our nation; and this means we must develop a world perspective.\\" (December 24, 1967, Atlanta, Georgia) * \\"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.\\" (April 16, 1963, Birmingham, Alabama) * \\"I have the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.\\" (December 10, 1964, Oslo, Norway) * \\"It is not enough to say 'We must not wage war.' It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace.\\" (December 24, 1967, Atlanta, Georgia) * \\"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\\" (February 25, 1967, Los Angeles, California) * \\"Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.\\" (April 4, 1967, Riverside Church, Manhattan, New York) * \\"We are determined here in Montgomery to work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.\\" (December 5, 1955, Montgomery, Alabama) * \\"We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience.\\" (April 16, 1963, Birmingham, Alabama) * \\"True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of justice.\\" (April 16, 1963, Birmingham, Alabama) Some of King's words reflected in these quotations are based on other sources, including the Bible, and in one case ‚Äì \\"the arc of the moral universe\\" quote ‚Äì paraphrases the words of Theodore Parker, an abolitionist and Unitarian minister, who died shortly before the beginning of the Civil War. Inscriptions on the Stone of Hope In addition to the fourteen quotations on the Inscription Wall, each side of the Stone of Hope includes an additional statement attributed to King. The first, from the \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, is \\"Out of the Mountain of Despair, a Stone of Hope\\" ‚Äì the quotation that serves as the basis for the monument's design. The words on the other side of the stone used to read, \\"I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness\\", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: \\"If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter.\\" The memorial's use of the paraphrased version of the quote was criticized, and was removed in August 2013. Artists Artists involved in the design and construction of the memorial include:\\"National Mall Times\\", National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Vol. 4, Issue 8, August 2011, pages 5-6. *Lei Yixin, sculptor *Nicholas Benson, Inscription designer and stone carver *Bob Fitch, SCLC Staff Photographer, whose photo image of King in his office in front of a photograph of Mohandas Gandhi was the basis for the monument *Devraux and Purnell/ROMA Design Group Joint Ventures *McKissack and McKissack/Turner Construction Company/Tompkins Builders, Inc./Gilford Corporation Joint Ventures Opening, dedication, and administration Sheryl Crow with Stevie Wonder at the dedication concert Hats given to attendees at the dedication ceremony Aretha Franklin speaks to the crowd at the dedication of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. At right Vice President Joe Biden, his wife Jill Biden, and President Barack Obama The memorial opened to visitors before its planned dedication, with visiting hours on August 22‚Äì25, 2011. The official dedication was initially scheduled to have taken place at 11 am Sunday August 28. The dedication was to follow a pre-dedication concert at 10 am. A post-dedication concert was scheduled for 2 pm. However, on August 25, the event's organizers postponed most Saturday and Sunday activities because of safety concerns related to Hurricane Irene, which was expected to impact the Washington area during the weekend. The organizers subsequently rescheduled the dedication to October 16, 2011, the 16th anniversary of the 1995 Million Man March on the National Mall. Before the event's postponement, President Barack Obama was expected to deliver remarks at the dedication ceremony. Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder were scheduled to perform. Many other individuals were also expected to participate in the event, including members of the King family; civil rights leaders John Lewis, Jesse Jackson, and Andrew Young; actor Jamie Foxx; and filmmaker George Lucas. As many as 250,000 people were predicted to attend the dedication. In addition to the August 28 ceremony and concerts, an interfaith prayer service was scheduled to take place at the Washington National Cathedral on August 27, as well as a day-long youth event and gala/pre-dedication dinner at the Washington D.C. Convention Center, also on the 27th. However, the prayer service was moved to the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in northeast Washington after the 2011 Virginia earthquake damaged the Cathedral on August 23. Although the dedication ceremony did not take place on August 28, the memorial officially became a United States national park on that day. The National Park Service has administered the memorial since it opened, and assumes responsibility for the memorial's operation and maintenance. On August 28, Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks unit of the National Park Service proclaimed: The rescheduled dedication on October 16 was a smaller affair than the one that organizers had planned for August 28. President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, Congressman John Lewis, Congressman Elijah Cummings and former Congressman Walter E. Fauntroy were among the more than 10,000 people that attended the event, which occurred on a temperate day. Obama gave a keynote address that linked the Civil Rights Movement to his own political struggles during the late-2000s recession. Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young, Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III also spoke during the ceremony. Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crow, James Taylor, Jennifer Holliday and Sweet Honey in the Rock performed. =President's remarks= At the ceremony, President Obama's keynote address included the following remarks:President's dedication remarks, from Whitehouse.gov website. Retrieved October 22, 2011. Reception =Fees to King family= In 2001, the foundation's efforts to build the memorial were stalled because Intellectual Properties Management Inc., an organization operated by King's family, wanted the foundation to pay licensing fees to use his name and likeness in marketing campaigns. The memorial's foundation, beset by delays and a languid pace of donations, stated that \\"the last thing it needs is to pay an onerous fee to the King family.\\" Joseph Lowery, past president of the King-founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference stated in The Washington Post, \\"If nobody's going to make money off of it, why should anyone get a fee?\\" Cambridge University historian David Garrow, who won a Pulitzer Prize for Bearing the Cross, his biography of King, said of King's family's behavior, \\"One would think any family would be so thrilled to have their forefather celebrated and memorialized in D.C. that it would never dawn on them to ask for a penny.\\" He added that King would have been \\"absolutely scandalized by the profiteering behavior of his children.\\" The family pledged that any money derived would go back to the King Center's charitable efforts. The foundation has paid various fees to the King family's Intellectual Properties Management Inc., including a management fee of $71,700 in 2003 (). In 2009, the Associated Press revealed that the King family had negotiated an $800,000 licensing deal () with the foundation for the use of King's words and image in fundraising materials for the memorial. =Conflicts between federal agencies= Further delay was encountered in 2008, due to a disagreement between the three federal agencies that must approve the memorial. The memorial design that was approved by the CFA and the NCPC was not approved by the NPS, due to security concerns. The NPS insisted upon the inclusion of a barrier that would prevent a vehicle from crashing into the memorial area. However, when the original design was submitted to the other two agencies, including such a barrier, the CFA and the NCPC rejected the barrier as being restrictive in nature, which would run counter to King's philosophy of freedom and openness. Eventually, a compromise was reached, which involved the use of landscaping to make the security barriers appear less intrusive upon the area. The compromise plan was approved in October 2009, clearing the way for construction of the memorial to begin. The memorial center's donor wall. =Design choices= Sculptor and laborers It was announced in January 2007 that Lei Yixin, an artist from the People's Republic of China, would sculpt the centerpiece of the memorial including the Stone of Hope, his statue of King. The commission was criticized by human rights activist Harry Wu on the grounds that Lei had previously sculpted Mao Zedong. It also stirred accusations that it was based on financial considerations, because the Chinese government would make a $25 million donation to help meet the projected shortfall in donations. The president of the memorial's foundation, Harry E. Johnson, who first met Lei in a sculpting workshop in Saint Paul, Minnesota, stated that the final selection was done by a mostly African American design team and was based solely on artistic ability. Gilbert Young, an artist known for a work of art entitled He Ain't Heavy, led a protest against the decision to hire Lei by launching the website \\"King Is Ours\\", which demanded that an African American artist be used for the monument. Human-rights activist and arts advocate Ann Lau and American stone-carver Clint Button joined Young and national talk-show host Joe Madison in advancing the protest when the use of Chinese granite was discovered. Lau decried the human rights record of the Chinese government and asserted that the granite would be mined by workers forced to toil in unsafe and unfair conditions, unlike that used in the National World War II Memorial, for example. Button argued that the $10 million in federal money that has been authorized for the King project required it to be subject to an open bidding process. In September 2010, the foundation gave written promises that it would use local stonemasons to assemble the memorial. However, when construction began in October, it appeared that only Chinese laborers would be used. An investigator working for the Washington area local of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers was reportedly told that the Chinese workers did not know what they would be paid for their work on the memorial and that they expected to be paid when they returned home. Stone used President Obama talks with President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil as they tour the Martin Luther King Memorial in Washington, D.C., June 29, 2015. The memorial's design team visited China in October 2006 to inspect potential granite to be used. The project's foundation has argued that only China could provide granite of that hue in sufficient quantity. Some questioned why such white granite would be used to portray a black man. Young's \\"King Is Ours\\" petition demanded that an African American artist and American granite be used for the national monument, arguing the importance of such selections as a part of the memorial's legacy. The petition received support from American granite workers and from the California State Conference of the NAACP. Style In May 2008, the Commission of Fine Arts, one of the agencies which had to approve all elements of the memorial, raised concerns about \\"the colossal scale and Social Realist style of the proposed sculpture\\", noting that it \\"recalls a genre of political sculpture that has recently been pulled down in other countries.\\" The Commission did, however, approve the final design in September 2008. Depiction New York Times art critic Edward Rothstein was among those who criticized the Stone of Hopes depiction of King as overly \\"stern\\" and not the proper depiction of a man famous for a speech like \\"I Have a Dream\\" or the Nobel Peace Prize: Rothstein, Edward, \\"A Mirror of Greatness, Blurred\\", New York Times, August 25, 2011, retrieved September 2, 2012. > We don't even see his feet. He is embedded in the rock like something not > yet fully born, suited and stern, rising from its roughly chiseled surface. > His face is uncompromising, determined, his eyes fixed in the distance, not > far from where Jefferson stands across the water. But kitsch here strains at > the limits of resemblance: Is this the Dr. King of the \\"I Have a Dream\\" > speech? Or the writer of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech? The way King is depicted with his arms crossed contributed to criticism that he appears stern.Eversley, Melanie, \\"MLK Memorial confronts controversy\\", USA Today, July 5, 2011. Retrieved September 2, 2012. On the other hand, King's son, Martin Luther King III, was quoted as being pleased with the sternness of the depiction, saying that \\"Well if my father was not confrontational, given what he was facing at the time, what else could he be?\\" =Paraphrase of a quote= One of the two quotes appearing on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, \\"I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness\\", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: \\"If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter.\\" The Washington Post's Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive. In a September 1, 2011 piece, and again on December 31 of the same year, The Post's editorial board agreed with Manteuffel that the wording on the monument should be changed. Poet and author Maya Angelou, a consultant on the memorial, also emphatically agreed, telling the Post: \\"The quote makes Dr. Martin Luther King look like an arrogant twit. ... It makes him seem less than the humanitarian he was. ... It makes him seem an egotist.\\" She also pointed out, \\"The 'if' clause that is left out is salient. Leaving it out changes the meaning completely.\\" The memorial's planners had originally intended to use the unrevised version of King's words, but adopted the paraphrased version when changes to the monument's design left them without enough space on the sculpture. \\"We sincerely felt passionate that the man's own eulogy should be expressed on the stone\\", said the memorial's executive architect, Ed Jackson Jr. \\"We said the least we could do was define who he was based on his perception of himself: 'I was a drum major for this, this and this.'\\" Jackson said the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts and two memorial advisers had not objected to the change, and that Angelou had not attended meetings where the inscription was discussed. On January 13, 2012, United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar ordered the quotation corrected. Salazar stated that he believed it was important that the inscription be changed and that he put a deadline on the delivery of the report because \\"things only happen when you put a deadline on it.\\" According to the project's lead architect, the correction of the quote was not a simple matter, as the current inscription is chiseled into the existing granite blocks. As the entire quotation will not fit on the monument, the replacement was still expected to be a paraphrase; however, project officials would not comment on proposed corrections until they were presented to Secretary Salazar. In December 2012, Salazar announced that the entire quote would be removed, starting in February or March 2013; it will not be replaced. To avoid leaving an impression of the erased inscription, the entire statue will be reworked on both sides, at a cost of $700,000 to $900,000. Harry Johnson, head of the memorial foundation, said, \\"We have come up with a design solution that will not harm the integrity of this work of art.\\" In August 2013, the sculptor removed the disputed inscription from the statue, and created a new finish for the side of the artwork. Sculptor Lei Yixin carved grooves over the former words to match existing horizontal \\"striation\\" marks in the memorial and deepened all the memorial's grooves so that they match.

Biography Sklar grew up in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. He graduated from New York University and volunteered at WNYC radio as a writer. He then worked at WPAC in Patchogue, New York, and in 1954 moved to WINS where he was assistant program director. In 1960, Sklar became program director at crosstown competitor WMGM. He moved to WABC in 1962 and became program director there in 1963. Under his management, WABC became the model for tight-playlist, teenager-targeted Top 40 programming, with a strong signal and famed disc jockeys such as \\"Cousin Brucie\\" Bruce Morrow, Dan Ingram, Harry Harrison, Chuck Leonard, and Ron Lundy. His relationship with some of the DJs he oversaw was contentious at times. Scott Muni departed from WABC after a number of confrontations with Sklar over playlists including Sklar's refusal to remove Louis Armstrong's version of the #1 smash hit \\"Hello, Dolly\\" from the playlist at Muni's request. Under Sklar, the station's ratings soared and was often the most listened to radio station in North America through the mid-60s into the late 70s. In March 1977, Sklar was promoted to vice president of programming for ABC‚Äôs radio division. In 1984 he left ABC to start his own consulting firm, Sklar Communications. His autobiography, Rocking America: An Insider's Story: How the All-Hit Radio Stations Took Over America (), was published by St. Martin's Press the same year. In an interview recorded in 1982, when WABC switched from music to talk programming, Sklar said: > Everything has to end, that's life, WABC is ‚Ä¶ like anything else it's part > of life, couldn't go on forever. But ‚Ä¶ it was a wonderful thing ‚Ä¶ it was a > one-of-a-kind ‚Ä¶ I don't think there'll ever be another station quite like > that. I mean, the scope of the thing was so huge, was so grand; everything > that was done was on such a massive scale. We gave out buttons, we gave out > 14 million with the WABC call letters and if we spot you we'll give you > $25,000. You know, this stuff is ‚Ä¶ it's just not done today.‚Ä¶ We'll miss it. > Radio will go on and on forever. Radio's the most adaptable medium there is, > and ‚Ä¶ the old WABC's place in radio will be remembered by everyone who ever > heard it, who ever grew up with it, it'll be part of millions and > millions‚Äîtens of millions of people's lives, and certainly the lives of > everyone in the radio business. Now we just have to go on to new things, and > I think we will.From \\"WABC: Julian Breen, Rick Sklar\\", on Jonathan Wolfert, > The First 20 Years (Dallas: JAM Productions, 1994) (promotional compact > disc). Sklar continued to write articles and books as well as visiting various colleges discussing the business of radio in general. He was also an adjunct professor at St. John's University. Personal life and death Rick was married to the former Sydelle Helfgott, who also served as vice president for his company, Sklar Communications. They had two children: a son Scott and a daughter Holly and three grandchildren: Emily, Samantha and Jacob. Prior to his death, Sklar had been an avid runner for more than ten years, taking it up in the late 1970s. He ran his first New York City Marathon in 1982, finishing 4 hours, 21 minutes, and 36 seconds; coming in 642nd out of 857 who finished the race in his age group. He began to have problems with his left foot, which necessitated him quitting the sport by 1990. In June 1992, he entered Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan for a minor operation that would allow him to run again. Although in good health, he died on the operating table due to a lack of oxygen and other mistakes made by the hospital staff. Legacy Sydelle Sklar died on November 21, 1992 of cancer. Rick Sklar was posthumously inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame the following year.
