He worked closely with Trigunatitananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna for Vedanta Society of San Francisco, later renamed as Vedanta Society of Northern California, and later became its president. Early life Prakashananda's pre monastic name was Sushil Chandra Chakravarty. His father was Ashutosh Chakravarty and the family resided in Serpentine Lane in Calcutta. Sushil Chandra was born on 8 July 1874. His brother Sudhir, who was rechristened as Shuddhananda, had also become a monk with Ramakrishna Order and was a direct monastic disciple of Vivekananda as well. Sushil and Sudhir during their college life had made friends with Kalikrishna, Khagen, Haripada and Govinda, a group of young men who were spiritually inclined. This group came in direct contact with Mahendranath Gupta (known as M), a direct householder disciple of Ramakrishna, and the author of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, in the course of their study in Ripon College where M was a lecturer. M had inspired them to visit Baranagar Math, where the monastic disciples of Ramakrishna had gathered for pursuing spiritual practices. Sushil was interested in both Western and Eastern philosophy and he developed intimacy with several direct disciples of Ramakrishna, including Ramakrishnananda and Yogananda. In 1891 he went to Jayrambati, the native place of Sarada Devi and was initiated by her. He was also associated with Gopal Chandra Ghosh, or Hutko Gopal, a direct householder disciple of Ramakrishna who would inspire him with anecdotes from the saint's life. He was also greatly inspired by the ideals of Vivekananda, who was then in America, preaching Vedanta. Sushil left home in 1896 under directive and guidance from Sarada Devi and joined the Alambazar Math. He also spent sometime in Vrindavan to practice austerities, in the company of Premananda. Monastic life and contribution When Vivekananda returned to India in February 1897, he granted monastic vows to Sushil and renamed him as Prakashananda. Prakashananda also accompanied Vivekananda when the latter went to seek the blessings of Sarada Devi in 1898 after his return from Kashmir. He also accompanied Vivekananda in consecrating the house of Navagopal Ghosh, a direct householder devotee of Ramakrishna by installation of the image of Ramakrishna in the house. During this occasion Vivekananda composed the famous Pranaam Mantra or the salutary chant on Ramakrishna which is a part of the Sanskrit hymn chanted in vesper services. Prakashananda assisted him during the worship ceremony.Wikisource:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 6/Conversations and Dialogues/XI Prakashananda served the famine stricken people in Dakshineswar as part of the relief program of Ramakrishna Mission in 1897-1898. In 1899 he and Swami Virajananda went to Dhaka to preach the message of Vedanta. The General Report of the Ramakrishna Mission Dhaka states, this branch of the Mission started as early as 1899 when Virajananda and Prakashananda, deputed by Vivekananda, visited these parts and by lectures and religious discourses created an interest in the message of Ramakrishna. Prakashananda and Virajananda also met Durga charan Nag (Nag Mahasaya), a prominent householder disciple of Ramakrishna in the village of Deobhog in East Bengal. In 1899 when Sarada Devi's younger brother Abhay Charan was terminally ill, Prakashananda along with Saradananda nursed him. He traveled on a pilgrimage to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the Himalayas in April 1900 and stayed in Rishikesh and Hardiwar for carrying out spiritual practices. He stayed for a while in the Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal with Kalyanananda. In 1902 he went to work in Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati and helped Swarupananda in editing Prabuddha Bharata. In the Americas In April 1906, Prakashananda was sent to assist Trigunatitananda in the affairs of the Vedanta Society of San Francisco. He helped Trigunatita for eight year's till the latter's death in 1914. He took regular classes and gave public lectures and brought out a magazine called Voice of Freedom. He also established the Pacific Vedanta Centre in 1914. After Trigunatita's death Prakashananda became the minister in charge. He laid more emphasis on training the spiritual aspirants. By reducing the expenditures of the society he paid off the large debt incurred for the construction of the first Hindu temple. He visited and lectured on Vedanta in different parts of California. He was elected a vice president of the International Buddhist Congress as part of the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition. As part of the Vedanta Society he also looked after Shanti Ashrama, a spiritual retreat first started by Turiyananda, a brother disciple of Vivekananda. He would bring students for spiritual practices and study of scriptures to this retreat. In order to recuperate from the strain of hard work, Prakashananda went to India in 1922 but returned to America in 1923 with two more monks, one of them being Prabhavananda, a disciple of Swami Brahmananda, the first president of Ramakrishna Order. He sent Prabhavananda on a lecture tour and encouraged him to establish new Vedanta Centres. The Vedanta Society of Portland was established in 1925 and Prakashananda himself presided over the inaugural ceremony. Death He suffered from diabetes and died on Sunday, 13 February 1927, at the age of fifty three. His obituary in Prabuddha Bharata read, May rest and eternal peace be the reward of him who on earth worked untiringly, unselfishly, who served God and man as Ms master would have it. We are reminded of Swami Vivekananda's words: Our salutation goes to all those God-like men who worked to help humanity.

An article in India Today reported that since 1990, the Indian Navy has lost one warship in peacetime every five years. Since 2004, it has lost one naval combatant every two years. While peacetime losses of warships are not uncommon, the magazine mentioned that few global navies have such a dubious record. According to the Times of India, while some of accidents reported since August 2013 were serious, many of them were trivial incidents exaggerated in public. These accidents have been attributed to ageing ships in need of maintenance (refit/repairs delayed in spite of laid down rules for refit cycles), delayed acquisitions by the Ministry of Defence, and human error. However naval commentators also argue that as India's large navy of 160 ships clocks around 12,000 ship-days at sea every year, in varied waters and weather, some incidents are inevitable. Captains of erring ships are dismissed from their command following an enquiry. The accident on board the submarine led to the resignation of the then Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral D K Joshi on 26 February 2014, who assumed moral responsibility for the loss. 2000 - 2010 *December 2005: , a , collided with a commercial vessel, Ambuja Laxmi, outside the Mumbai harbor, while returning from a training mission. This class of ship uses stealth technology and a special hull design to ensure a reduced radar cross section. Radar systems installed by the port authorities and those on board Ambuja Laxmi were unable to detect INS Trishul and prevent the side on collision. No casualties were reported. * April 2006: , a , sank after colliding with MV Rajiv Gandhi about away from the Goa coast. No casualties were reported. The commanding officer of the ship, Lieutenant Commander Yogesh Tripathi was found guilty of negligence by an Indian Navy court-martial and removed from Command. *September 2006: , a , collided with a Shipping Corporation of India merchant vessel, MV Kiti, off the coast of Mumbai. There were no casualties, but the Dunagiri suffered damage and required extensive repairs. *January 2008: , a , collided with a foreign merchant vessel MV Leeds Castle while trying to surface in waters north of Mumbai. The submarine was taking part in fleet- level war games, when the accident occurred. The Navy termed it a minor incident with no casualties reported. *February 2008: Five crew were killed and three critically injured due to exposure to hydrogen sulfide aboard , a landing platform dock. The ship was taking part in exercises in the Bay of Bengal. *August 2009: A collision of the missile corvette with destroyer in the Bay of Bengal was traced to a rudder failure, compounded by a flawed maneuver. 2010 - present *In 2010, three crew members on destroyer were instantly killed when an AK-630 Close-in weapon system went off as safety drills were not followed. *January 2011: , a , capsized after a collision with a Cyprus-flagged merchant vessel MV Nordlake near the Sunk Rock light house, following which a major fire broke out in the ship's engine and boiler room. Everyone on board was evacuated as soon as the fire broke out and hence there were no casualties. INS Vindhyagiri was later decommissioned. *August 2013: Blasts ripped through the torpedo compartment of the submarine while it was berthed at the naval dockyard off the Mumbai coast. Fifteen sailors and three officers were killed. Other sources state that a small explosion occurred around midnight which then triggered the two larger explosions. The disaster was thought to be the Indian navy's worst since the sinking of the frigate by a Pakistani submarine during the 1971 war. *December 2013: , a under the Eastern Naval Command, caught fire at the naval dockyard at Visakhapatnam while undergoing repairs. The fire engulfed much of the ship's interior before it was extinguished. No casualties were reported. *December 2013: In the second incident in the same month, , the lead ship of the s of the Indian Navy, collided with a fishing trawler injuring four of the 27 people on board the trawler and sinking it. The fishing trawler was operating without lights. The captain of the ship was subsequently stripped of command. *December 2013: In the third incident in the same month, , again a Talwar-class frigate, suffered damage to its hull when it hit the jetty while docking at the Mumbai naval base. The navy ordered a board of inquiry. *January 2014: , a guided missile frigate, ran aground and collided with an unidentified object while approaching the Mumbai naval base. The sonar system of the frigate was cracked, leading to faulty readings and an ingress of saltwater into sensitive equipment. *January 2014: In the second incident in the same month, , a of the elite 22nd Killer Missile Vessel Squadron, was detected with a hole in its pillar compartment which forced the ship back into the harbour while it was on an operational deployment. *February 2014: On 3 February, , a amphibious warfare vessel, ran aground while returning to its home base at Visakhapatnam, causing slight damage to its propellers. Following the incident, its commanding officer, Captain JPS Virk, was relieved of command pending the findings of a Board of Inquiry. *February 2014: On 26 February, , a , had a fire detected on board when trials were being conducted which resulted in smoke leading to suffocation and death of two officers. Seven sailors were reported injured and were airlifted to the naval base hospital in Mumbai. According to the naval board of inquiry, the fire was caused due to problems in the cables of the vessel. This particular incident led to the resignation of Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) Admiral D K Joshi on 26 February 2014, who owned moral responsibility for the incidents in the past few months. *March 2014: had a malfunction on board which led to a toxic gas leak killing Commander Kuntal Wadhwa instantly. According to the Indian Navy, the ship suffered a malfunction in its carbon dioxide unit while undergoing machinery trials, leading to gas leakage. Since the ship was not commissioned at the time of the incident, the enquiry into the mishap will be done by Mazagon Dock Limited, where the ship was constructed. *May 2014: suffered a minor explosion in the boiler room while undergoing a refit at the Mumbai dockyard. Four people suffered minor injuries. There was no fire and no equipment was damaged. *November 2014: A torpedo recovery vessel of the A-73 sank off the Vizag coast during a routine mission to recover torpedoes fired by fleet ships during a routine exercise. The accident resulted in the death of one sailor while four others were reported as missing however 23 other personnel were rescued by SAR teams deployed right after the incident. *March 2015: A Dornier Do 228 aircraft belonging to the Indian Navy Aviation Squadron 310, on a routine training mission, lost radar contact and ditched at sea about southwest of Goa on the night of 24 March 2015. The aircrew on board the aircraft comprised three officers (two pilots and one female observer). The lone survivor, Commander Nikhil Kuldip Joshi, was picked up by a passing fishing boat. The bodies of the other two officers Lieutenant Abhinav Nagori and Lieutenant Kiran Shekhawat were recovered. Media reports suggested that the female observer could be the first woman in India's military to die in active service. Meanwhile, a Board of Inquiry was ordered to establish the cause of the accident. *November 2015: , a , conducted BrahMos missile test firings whilst the airspace remained open to traffic, due to a communication failure. *March 2016: A fire broke out on the soon-to-be decommissioned aircraft carrier which resulted in the death of one and the injury of three others. *April 2016: A sailor lost his leg while two others were injured in an oxygen cylinder explosion on board . The explosion took place on 16 April while a diving bailout bottle, a small oxygen bottle that is carried by divers in their diving helmet, was being charged. The sailors were admitted in the Military Hospital, Trivandrum as the ship was on it way to Mumbai from Visakhapatnam. *June 2016: Two people, a sailor and a civilian contractor, were killed by a toxic gas leak that occurred during maintenance work in the Sewage Treatment Plant compartment during the first refit of the aircraft carrier at Karwar. Two other people were injured and taken to the naval hospital. *August 2016: A minor fire broke out at INS Dega after a MiG-29K accidentally jettisoned one of its drop tanks. *October 2016: Sub Lieutenant Tejveer Singh died on 11 October 2016 onboard INS Kuthar after he accidentally fired his 9mm pistol.

The main mast of the ship broke when it tipped over due to a failure in the dock block mechanism. The ship was being undocked after undergoing a midlife refit. *January 2017: A minor fire broke out at 11.40am on 10 January in the Gyro compartment of INS Pralay during welding work at Mumbai naval dockyard. The fire was extinguished by the ship's staff and the Naval Dockyard fire station and no one was injured during the incident. *February 2017: A minor fire broke out on 1 February 2017 in the left engine room of INS Kamorta when it was operating at sea. The room was immediately evacuated and the fire put out using the ship's Fixed fire system and there were no injuries during the incident. *October 2017: , while stern maneuvering to the dock, collided by the stern with Russian ship Irytsh in Vladivostok on 19 October during Indra 2017.

Hildyard was appointed to the Cabinet of South Australia in September 2017 as Minister for Disabilities; and served in this role until the 2018 state election.  Background and early career  Hildyard was born in Adelaide and grew up in Netley with her brother and two sisters. During Hildyard's childhood her mother was the victim of domestic violence from her estranged father, which shaped her passion on the issue in later life. Hildyard attended Plympton High School and studied a Bachelor of Arts at Flinders University as a mature age student. She worked as a cleaner, shop assistant, lecturer, and clerical worker. She later graduated from the Australian Institute of Company Directors and was a Fellow of the Governor's Leadership Foundation. Hildyard joined the Labor Party in the 1990s and became a member of the Labor Left. She worked for ALP Senator Nick Bolkus between 1994 and 1996. In 1996 Hildyard began working for the South Australian branch of the Australian Services Union (ASU), where she was elected Assistant Secretary in 2006 and later Secretary in 2009. As Secretary the ASU campaigned for overwhelmingly female community sector workers to have their wages increased to match their mainly-male private sector counterparts. An equal pay case before Fair Work Australia was successful in 2012, and the State Government committed to increasing wages between 19 and 41 per cent. The ASU also committed to supporting same-sex marriage and lobbying the Labor Party to change its policy, which at the time was opposed to any change. In 2008 Hildyard participated in the social inclusion stream of the Australia 2020 Summit. She was appointed to the Premier's Council for Women in 2011. As part of the 2012 Australia Day honours she received the 'Women Hold Up Half The Sky' award, recognising women who advance and enrich society, for the ASU's community sector equal pay campaign.  Political career  At the 2014 state election Hildyard was elected as the Labor member for Reynell, replacing retiring member Gay Thompson. In her maiden speech, Hildyard said her priorities included reducing domestic violence, supporting equal pay for women, maintaining high quality mental health services, and recognising Indigenous Australians in the constitution. Hildyard lobbied Attorney-General John Rau to include paid domestic violence leave as an industrial right for 120,000 public sector employees. In February 2015 Hildyard was promoted to the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier. She also led a taskforce on Women in Sport, composed of athletes, administrators and event managers, to help close the pay gap for women athletes and encourage investment in women's sport. She joined fellow MPs Nat Cook and Chris Picton, located in Adelaide's southern suburbs, to oppose the government's proposed changes to emergency department services at the Noarlunga Hospital. Hildyard pledged to update the Equal Opportunity Act to prevent discrimination against victims of domestic violence, and to provide paid annual leave to victims so they can attend medical and police appointments, and move house if necessary. She also launched a parliamentary anti-domestic violence group with Liberal MP Dan Van Holst Pellekaan. Hildyard was elected the President of the South Australian Labor Party in October 2015. Hildyard also co-sponsored a bill to remove discrimination against same-sex parents being listed on the birth certificate of a child. Hildyard was appointed to cabinet in September 2017 as Minister for Disabilities; and served in this role until the 2018 state election.  Personal life  Hildyard lives in Christies Beach with her husband, Charles, and two children. She is a practicing Catholic.

He resigned as President and member of the Legislative Council in February 2020, to take up the vacant seat in the Senate. Prior to entering state parliament, McLachlan was a lawyer, army officer and a businessman working in the financial services industry. Education McLachlan holds a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Adelaide, a Master of Laws from the University of Edinburgh and a Master of Business Administration from the Australian Graduate School of Management (University of Sydney and University of New South Wales). Career prior to politics McLachlan commenced his legal career as a young lawyer in regional South Australia, based in Port Augusta. McLachlan has held senior leadership and executive positions in the financial services industry. He also served on the national executive of the Trustee Corporations Association of Australia and on the compliance and investment boards of the Financial Services Council. He served as the Director of the International Centre for Financial Services at the University of Adelaide. Prior to taking up executive appointments, McLachlan worked as a lawyer specialising in superannuation, banking and finance law. McLachlan is also a Fellow of the Taxation Institute of Australia and the Financial Services Institute of Australasia. Political career =State politics= McLachlan was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council at the 2014 state election for an eight-year term. In March 2015, the 99-year grave licence at Centennial Park for an ANZAC World War I veteran who had fought at Gallipoli expired. No family was located to pay for the continuation of the lease, and there was a possibility of the site being reused. As a fellow veteran, McLachlan paid the licence renewal fee to preserve the historical site.The Advertiser, 5 March 2015, Page 11, 'Lib MP digs into his own pocket to save ANZAC grave', Sarah Rohweder. In July 2015, McLachlan crossed the floor and voted against the Statutes Amendment (Serious and Organised Crimes) Amendment Bill 2015, better known at the time as the 'Bikies Bill', which was contrary to the Liberal Party's position at the time. McLachlan had argued that Parliament should not act like a court and the provision in the Bill breached the principle of the separation of powers. He was the only Liberal Member of Parliament to vote against the Bill. McLachlan is a strong supporter of the rule of law. In late 2015 McLachlan introduced a Bill that would give legal protections to the identity of individuals who provide sensitive information to journalists. This is a common protection in other Australian jurisdictions, however; in South Australia the current law requires journalists to identify sources during court proceedings or commissions of inquiry, otherwise face a potential prison sentence. The Bill was ultimately not supported by the Government. In August 2017, McLachlan introduced an amendment to a motion put forward by the SA Greens and Advance SA MLCs calling for the Australian Government to 'recognise the State of Palestine, as we have recognised the state of Israel, and announce the conditions and timelines to achieve such recognition.' McLachlan's amendment called 'on both sides to resume direct negotiations in good faith' and 'on the Commonwealth government to recognise the state of Palestine once the two sides have successfully negotiated a two-state solution, as required by international law.' This amended motion was passed by the South Australian Legislative Council and welcomed by many Jewish organisations including the Australia/Israel Jewish Affairs Council, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry and the Jewish Community Council of South Australia. At the time of moving his successful amendment, McLachlan told Members of the Legislative Council: On 3 May 2018, McLachlan was nominated to serve as President of the South Australian Legislative Council being elected by the Members of the Legislative Council unopposed. =Federal politics= On 1 February 2020, McLachlan was selected by the South Australian Liberal Party to fill a vacant seat in the Australian Senate caused by the resignation of former Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi. McLachlan defeated former Law Council of Australia president Morry Bailes and former state party treasurer Michael van Dissel. He resigned as President and a member of the Legislative Council on 5 February 2020, and was appointed to the Senate by a joint sitting of the South Australian Parliament the following day. He will serve the remainder of Bernardi's term which expires on 30 June 2022.

She participated in the founding of the Puerto Rican Feminist League and was a co-founder of the Association of Women Graduates of the University of Puerto Rico. She was the second president of the Puerto Rican Association of Women Suffragists and was one of the first women to run for a Senatorial seat once they achieved enfranchisement. Early years and education Isabel Andreu y Blanco was born on 15 November 1887, in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to Crist√≥bal Andreu Comendador and Blanca Irene Blanco Guzm√°n. She was born during the period in which the island was an administrative district of Spain and her father, originally from Majorca, would become the mayor of Fajardo. Her mother was a native Puerto Rican. After attending elementary school, she won a scholarship to attend Normal School in 1902, graduating in 1907 as one of the first class of alumni of the Escuela Normal of the University of Puerto Rico. Career Andreu began work as a teacher in the model school affiliated with the university, but soon returned home to Fajardo where she continued teaching. In 1917, when the Carnegie Library was created, she was appointed to serve on the board of directors. That same year, she became the vice president of the Puerto Rican Feminist League (), which was founded by Ana Roqu√© (1853-1933). The League was active in trying to gain women the right to vote and when their local senator, Antonio Rafael Barcel√≥, refused to discuss the matter, Andreu, Mar√≠a L. de Ashford and Milagros Benet de Mewton went to plead their case in Washington, D.C. In 1921, the organization changed its name to the Suffragist Social League () and expanded its platform women's suffrage to full civic and political participation. In 1924, Andreu, along with Rosario Bellber, Maria Cadilla de Mart√≠nez, Luisa Callejo, Beatriz Lasalle, Ana L√≥pez de V√©lez, Roqu√©, and Amina Ti√≥ de Malaret all resigned from the League over ideological differences. The following year Roqu√© and Andreu formed the Puerto Rican Association of Women Suffragists (). The crux of the ideological split was whether extending the vote to women should include universal suffrage or whether it should be restricted to educated women. Andreu and Roqu√© were in the camp which favored education as a prerequisite to voting. That same year, 1925, Andreu was appointed to serve on the Board of Trustees of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1929, Andreu was selected as president of the Association of Women Suffragists and the women were successful in attaining the vote for literate women. In 1932, Andreu ran as a Senator for the Liberal Party, the first woman ever to run. After losing the election, Andreu returned to school and completed a Bachelor of Education at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935. Later that year, she studied sociology at Columbia University, and later graduated with a Master in Arts specializing in adult education. In 1936, Andreu and other professional women founded the Association of Women Graduates of the University of Puerto Rico with the goals of improving the professional, academic and cultural development of its members and the university. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, she continued her trusteeships with the Library and University, as well as public speaking engagements and writing on topics ranging from education to women's rights to adult literacy. Andreu died on 7 April 1948 and posthumously, a building at the University of Puerto Rico was bestowed with her name, as well as a street in San Juan.

The 750 is powered by a 749 cc displacement version of Harley's 60¬∞ SOHC V-twin, water-cooled Revolution engine dubbed the Revolution X. The Street 500 has a 494 cc engine with a smaller bore but is otherwise identical. Production for sale in the United States and Canada is done at Harley's Kansas City facility; production for the rest of the world, including engines, is done at the Harley-Davidson India subsidiary in Bawal with indigenous components. Street series bikes are positioned as Harley's entry-level models, with a price point that is the lowest for Harley's US lineup by over $1,200. Harley-Davidson Street Rod For 2017, Harley released the Street Rod based on the 750 Street model. This new model introduced new features such as higher output Revolution X engine @ 8,750 rpm and @ 4,000 rpm, 43 mm inverted front forks and piggyback reservoir rear shocks, drag-style bars and 17 inch wheels. The new model, responding to market feedback that demanded a sporty standard, was meant to compete with bikes like the Yamaha FZ-07 and FZ-09. Riders Edge Program The Street 500 replaced the Buell Blast in Harley-Davidson's rider training program. Reactions Speculation about Harley \\"outsourcing\\" production of 500 and 750 cc models (called small-displacement in US press) to India began at least as early as 2011, along with harsh criticism that by not offering smaller bikes there, Harley \\"doesn't understand emerging markets\\". The New York Times also opined that Harley's move towards medium-displacement echoed that of other manufacturers for the developing world. Strong growth of the Indian market led an American commentator to call this \\"The most important new Harley-Davidson in living memory\\", and another to predict more bidirectional interaction between American and Indian manufacturers and consumers, naming the Harley Street along with other Indian-made or Indian- owned marques like Hero MotoCorp, KTM, and BMW: 2014 Harley-Davidson Street 750 side view References ;Citations ;Sources     * External links * Category:Cruiser motorcycles Street Category:Indian motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2014 ","title":"Harley-Davidson Street"},{"id":"42215786","text":"Jianqiao is a town located in Fengshun County, Meizhou City, Guangdong Province, China.

It stars Priscila Assum and Silvio Guindane as two Rio de Janeiro favela's children who become involved in the kidnapping of an American man played by Larry Pine. How Angels Are Born has received awards at film festivals, and has been well received by critics. Plot Maguila, a developmentally delayed man, accidentally kills the drug lord of Favela Santa Marta, Rio de Janeiro. Pursued by other drug dealers, Maguila flees from the favela along with a 13-year-old tomboy nicknamed Branquinha who proclaims herself Maguila's wife. Amid the confusion, Branquinha takes her friend Japa into a car whose driver is forced to help Maguila. Suddenly, Maguila gets out of the car with the children. They arrive at the house of the American William, and Maguila asks to use his bathroom to relieve himself, as according to Branquinha he was well-bred by his mother and cannot bring himself to urinate outdoors. Assuming it is a robbery, William's chauffeur shoots Maguila who in response kills him. In the house, they discover Dona Concei√ß√£o, William's maid, and Julie, William's daughter, both trying to call the police, but Japa prevents them from doing it. Maguila and the children do not want to stay there, but Maguila wants first aid to be performed on his wound before leaving. Julie attempts to bandage him up, but when the fugitive trio are about to leave the house, Japa notices a police car nearby. Japa recommends that they to wait until it goes away, and Branquinha and Japa tie up the residents. While Maguila is exhausted due to his injury, Japa explores the house and Branquinha becomes fascinated by Julie, forcing her to take off her shirt so she can admire her breasts. The police car eventually disappears, but Maguila decides to rest. In this time, Marta, William's secretary, finds it odd that no one answers the doorbell, and calls the police. Trapped inside the house, the children and William try to negotiate with the police to leave the place. They request the presence of an American ambassador, a children's rights non-governmental organization, and the press to assure their security. To show off to the police, Branquinha asks Julie to wear fancy clothes to give the appearance that she is safe. While the children are on the second floor choosing Julie's clothes for her appearance on television, Concei√ß√£o manages to escape from the ties that held her. Japa instructs her to stop trying to release William from his ties and attempting to escape, which she refuses, leading Japa to accidentally kill her. After this, Japa and Branquinha argue about the best way to escape, and accidentally kill each other. The police then invade the home and rescue William and Julie.

Luiz Zannin Oricchio, writing for O Estado de S. Paulo, called it \\"one of the best films of the so-called renaissance of Brazilian cinema\\". The author of the book Splendors of Latin Cinema, Hernandez Rodriguez, declared it is \\"far from the visual rush, the intensity, and the perfection of style, as well as the visual of pyrotechnics of Cidade de Deus\\", and said it is \\"definitely more interesting than Cidade dos Homens\\". The way children are represented in How Angels Are Born was commented by Italian Neorealism and Global Cinemas writers Laura E. Ruberto and Kristi M. Wilson, who compared it to Italian neorealism films. Varietys critic Ken Eisner praised Assum's performances, stating Branquinha was \\"played memorably\\" by her, as well as its cinematography, which helps \\"to offset plot claustrophobia\\".

It lies away from the district headquarters of Udhampur. Manwal is a small town surrounded by the Shivalik Mountains. The Manwal railway station is located approximately from the main town area. Manwal is famous for an ancient Devi Bhagavati Temple which lies in the town. The Devi Bhagavati Temple was originally dedicated to Vishnu and dates back to the 10th or 11th century CE. Bhagavati Temple Bhagavati temple has been taken over by the Archaeological Survey of India for preservation and protection along with four other ancient temples. It consists of a Garbhgriha (sanctum) and an Antarala with square Mandapa. The walls of the Mandapa have eight niches. As per legend, the garbhgrihas once carried an image of Shakti, the divine power of creation. The outer chamber is open but the entrance doors have been richly carved with deities of different natures. The horizontal beam of the door has been carved with the images of navgraha, and is intermittently decorated with floral and geometrically designed motifs. The temple is a wide path around the main building wherein several sculptures of gods are kept. The most prominent among them are the images of Surya and Mahavira. There is a strange sculpture of a carved serpentine coil kept in a niche of the main wall of the parikrama. Other images include various incarnations of Shakti and Shiva. The temples are stone structures, which the great Kashmir ruler Lalitaditya built at the foot of Harmukh mountain in Kashmir in the 8th century AD. The remains of the ancient temples feature art and architecture that was prevalent in their time. Some of the stones, monolithic beams, and pillars used in their construction are over a dozen feet long and their sculptures and carvings are splendid and impressive. Historian Ashok Jerath, in his book tilted 'Dogra legends of Art and Culture' has written, \\"A few hundred meters from the main road, deep in the village of Dera, we found a colossus structure of a massive building with towering pillars, wide sanctums and open mandapas. This holy building is erected on a massive platform which can be reached with a flight of twelve steps on the west side. We suddenly found ourselves in a wide chamber with eight fluted columns having ornamental bases. These columns might have been used for the support of horizontal and oblique slabs which we found in one of the surviving roofs of Kala Dera temples.\\" These slabs support the stone sheets forming the roof of the chamber or so-called antechamber. There are four garbhagrihas. The upper door beams of the entrance possess the beautiful carvings of Gods and Goddesses which have deteriorated to some extent. However, carvings of navgrahas on the horizontal upper beam of the door of the garbhagrihas, situated at the north side of the temple, are still magnificent in their form and structure. Almost all the frames of garbhagrihas contain the carvings of the river deities and their maids. In the center of each upper beam, there is a carving of Lord Ganesha. They are planned in the style of Sapt Rathis. The niches with lotus flower decoration and the horizontal beam supported by two vertical columns contain different deities. Some of the niches are devoid of any deity. The outer walls of the temple are decorated with the chiseling of geometrical figures, triangles, quadrangles and so on, which is the unique character of this temple. Since this is a Shikhara style of temple and in structure closely related to Krimchi temples the time period of its construction is believed to be around the 10th century. Historians and art critics could not trace the genesis of the feudal lords responsible for its construction. Manwal area of this district has a few monuments whose existence dates back to about 10th century AD. Kala Dera Temples Kala Dera templeS. Joshi, Kala Dera temples refers to a black temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva and faces east. The literal translation for Kala Dera is \\"Black Stones\\". It comprises a Garbhagriha (Sanctum), an Antarala (Vestibule), an Ardhamandapa (Entrance Porch) and a Mandapa (Hall). The temple is built on a high platform and heralded by a Mandapa. The entrance is through a flight of stairs in the east direction. The superstructure is somewhat missing and the temple has two columns of the sanctum, the entrance to the Mandappa and the bases of four jambs. Between the sanctum and the Mandappa lies a porch which also contains similar pillar bases. The noteworthy architectural members lying at the site are fluted, shafts, carved ceiling with inverted lotus flowers beside sculptures which have been preserved. A second temple is Saptaratha on plan externally and is also built on an elevated platform. There is a Makara- Mukha (makara-faced) pranala through which the water flows into a small rectangular storage tank and is carved out of a single block. The roof of Mandappa is supported on four fluted columns surmounted by capitals. Besides the principal entrance facing the central aisles, it has two smaller entrances at the rear end. The figures on the jambs of the door and porch are now damaged. A well can be spotted in close vicinity. Dera Temple, Thalora This temple is also constructed on a raised rectangular platform which is approached by a flight of stairs on the west side. It has two principal square sanctums divided from each other by a luxuriant cell. Each of the sanctums is preceded by a porch having two fluted pillars surmounted by a very baroque vase and floral capitals. The decoration over the architrave above the columns of the porch of the sanctum on the northern side of the mandappa contains ornamented Navagraha panel. The ASI has played an important part in bringing the structure back to its original state. This temple is assigned the same date as the previous ones. Devi Bhagavati Temple Devi Bhagavati temple consists of a Garbhagriha (Sanctum), an Antarala (Vestibule), an Ardhamandapa (Entrance Porch) and a Mandapa (Hall). The entrance of the antrala has a joist which is carved with figures of Ganesha at the center while its jambs bear the characters of Ganga and Yamuna. Externally, the temple is well ornamented. It has foliated projecting triangles alternating with rectangular fortes surmounted by stepped pediments. Garbhagriha is wreathed with plain mouldings, niches on central projection for Parsva Devtas (subsidiary Gods). The temple structure dates back to circa 10th century AD. Favorite tourist spots like Mansar, Suruisar, Patnitop, Mata Vaishno Devi, Katra etc. are 10 km,18 km,75 km and 50 km respectively. Manwal falls under Ramnagar constituency.

During the ongoing war in the Donbass region of Ukraine, the forces of the revived National Guard have fought against pro-Russian separatists and Russian troops disguised as separatists. Due to lack of reserves, earlier in the conflict Azov and Donbass battalions were the largest volunteer units by far with a strength of 1,000 and 900 soldiers respectively plus an extensive civilian support network that reinforced the National Guard.Ukraine underplays role of far right in conflict, BBC News (13 December 2014) History The National Guard was recreated in accordance with the Law of Ukraine \\"On the National Guard of Ukraine\\" [Law number 4393] dated 12 March 2014, (the draft legislation being originally introduced to the Ukrainian parliament on 11 March). A previous attempt by then President Yushchenko to bring back the National Guard during civil unrest in 2008 had been blocked in the Rada. It was finally re-established in March 2014 after the beginning of the Crimean crisis. The NSU was originally created by the Law of Ukraine \\"On the National Guard of Ukraine\\" dated 4 November 1991, ‚Ññ 1775 -XII. Dissolved by the Law of Ukraine \\"On Amendments and Additions to Certain Legislative Acts of Ukraine\\" dated 11 January 2000. During its early existence, the National Guard was indirectly involved in the Transnistrian conflict during the Spring/Summer of 1992, helping to defend the border against a threatened spill-over of the conflict into Ukraine. Formations involved were the 3rd, 4th and 5th divisions NSU (equipment transferred from the 93rd Motorized Rifle Division was also used in this deployment). Afterwards, up until 1998, National Guard units backed up the border guards in anti-smuggling operations conducted on the border with Moldova and Moldova's breakaway Transnistria region. =Badge of the NGU 1991‚Äì2000= National Guard of Ukraine.pngHeadquarters 1 –ö–∏—ó–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—è –ù–ì–£.png1st Kyiv division 2 –°—Ö—ñ–¥–Ω–∞ –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—è –ù–ì–£.png2nd Eastern division 3 –ü—ñ–≤–¥–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—è –ù–ì–£.png3rd Southern division –ï–º–±–ª–µ–º–∞ 4-—ó –ü—ñ–≤–Ω—ñ—á–Ω–æ—ó –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—ó –ù–ì–£.png4th Northern division –ï–º–±–ª–µ–º–∞ 5-—ó –ó–∞—Ö—ñ–¥–Ω–æ—ó –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—ó –ù–ì–£.png5th Western division 6 –°—Ö—ñ–¥–Ω–∞ –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—è –ù–ì–£.png6th Eastern division 7 –ö—Ä–∏–º—Å—å–∫–∞ –¥–∏–≤—ñ–∑—ñ—è –ù–ì–£.png7th Crimea division =Reformation= In 2014, amidst Russian intervention to Crimea, the reformed force was created partially on the basis of the Internal Troops of Ukraine, with plans for militias and armed wings from certain of Ukraine's political parties and organisations, including the Euromaidan movement, to be also incorporated into it. However those plans have run into resistance from at least some of the latter, who do not wish to give up their weapons or otherwise subordinate themselves to government control. Direct recruitment from military academies was also intended. On 16 March, the Yatsenyuk Government announced plans for the recruitment of 10,000 people within the next 15 days for the National Guard. Individual volunteers were also accepted. The 2014 law provides for an initial authorised strength of 33,000 personnel. It also tasks the National Guard with maintaining public order, protecting sites like nuclear power plants and \\"upholding the constitutional order and restoring the activity of state bodies\\", in part a reference to the situation in Crimea, as well as to the perceived Russian threat to Ukraine as a whole. In the eastern parts of the country in particular, not only will the National Guard reinforce regular military units defending against a feared Russian invasion, it will also be expected to uphold Part 1 of Art. 109 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (i.e. it is intended to act as a counterinsurgency force against fifth columnists and infiltrators). The National Guard will be receiving a large proportion of the money from the emergency budgetary reprogramming approved by parliament for the funding of weapons procurement, equipment repair, and training (said reprogramming is equivalent to $600 million in 2014 Dollars). It is hoped that, eventually, the strength of the National Guard will rise to 60,000 personnel. The pay for National Guard regulars is approximately 214 Euros ($297) a month, equivalent to an average Ukrainian's monthly income. Officers receive about twice that amount. There are also some attached Internal Troops personnel, mostly for training and/or logistical support purposes, e.g. K-9 teams that have been taking part in training and demonstration sessions. Three National Guardsmen died in a riot on 31 August 2015 at the Verkhovna Rada when a policeman on leave threw a grenade outside the facade. According to official figures, by mid-April 2016, the Interior Ministry and the National Guard have lost 308 personnel since the War in Donbass broke out, including 108 from the National Guard's volunteer battalions.  National Guard Structure  thumbright520pxNational Guard Operational-Territorial Commands As of 2017 the National Guard is divided in five Operational-Territorial Commands: * Western Operational-Territorial Command * Northern Operational-Territorial Command * Central Operational-Territorial Command * Eastern Operational- Territorial Command * Southern Operational-Territorial Command A sixth Operational-Territorial Command for Crimea has been organized only on paper until the peninsula is returned by Russia to Ukraine (currently the Crimean units are under the National Guard of Russia). There are various types of units in the National Guard: * Operational units are military trained and equipped combat forces. * Public Security Protection and Patrol units fulfil police functions * Transport units guard troop and prisoner convoys * Important State Facilities Protection units guard Ukrainian state enterprises involved in missile industry, and Ukraine's nuclear industry * Independent National Guard units contain a mix of operational, patrol and transport units In case that martial law would be declared all National Guard units, with the exception of transport units, would come under the command of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine as auxiliary to the Armed Forces proper. = Directly Subordinated Units = * General Directorate of the National Guard of Ukraine, Kyiv

During World War II the regiment had been about the protection and defense of the Georgian Military Road, took part in the assault and liberation of the city of Novorossiysk, for which he was awarded the honorary title of \\"Novorossiysk\\". The regiment performed garrison service tasks and elimination of hostile elements in areas liberated from Nazi occupation. In 1945, the work provided the Yalta Conference of State anti- Hitler coalition. On 24 November 1945, the regiment was relocated to the city of Kiev, where the personnel performing the functions inherent internal forces (combat gang violence, criminal groups, public order and public authorities in Kiev). 1945‚Äì1947 years - units of the regiment took part in the fight against gang violence in western Ukraine. In 1970, the regiment provided the public order in Odesa for eliminating the cholera epidemic. In 1980 he took part in ensuring public order during the Olympic Games. In 198 5 he ensured public order at Moscow during the World Youth Forum. From 26 April 1986 till May 1987 took part in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident (protection of public order, combating looting). From 1988 to 1991 served as a peacekeeping mission in the Caucasus. In 1992 the regiment joined the National Guard of Ukraine. Only part of the National Guard of Ukraine carried out the functions and tasks that are at present assigned to the Internal Troops of Ukraine. After the disbanding of the National Guard of Ukraine in 2000 according to the Decree of the President of Ukraine, he was transferred to the Armed Forces of Ukraine and at its base the 1 single Novorossiysk-Kiev Order of the Red Banner Regiment of the President of Ukraine (in / hr A-0222).

In the 2014 structure, it reports both administratively and operationally to the Minister of Internal Affairs, a position at present held by Arsen Avakov. In the old NSU, its overall Commander was originally appointed by the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) for 5-year terms. His Deputy Commander was appointed to the post by the President of Ukraine upon a submission from the Commander. However, in 1995 the system was changed so that both the Commander and Deputy Commander would be appointed by the President. The Central Band of the National Guard of Ukraine Also part of the NSU was the Military Council, which approved the personal staff of the President of Ukraine based on submissions from the Commander, and the Department of National Guard, an administrative entity acting in accordance with the terms of reference approved by the President of Ukraine. This included the Guard's secondary Disaster management role.  2014 Organisation and Structure  As of late March 2014, it was still in flux. However, current developments suggest that the 'new' National Guard will primarily be a Light infantry force, heavily reliant on reserve units with a few mechanized and armor support elements. This is in contrast to the 'old' National Guard, which was mostly a Mechanized infantry force, albeit one that incorporated a number of specialized formations and units, along with organic armor, artillery and air support elements. The first of the new National Guard's regular battalions formally paraded on 6 April, after only three weeks of training. The unidentified battalion consists of 500 members of between 18 and 55 years of age, and it appears to be tasked as a rapid reaction force, using soft skinned vehicles such as trucks for transport. The 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade was formed as part of the National Guard on 2 June 2015. The commander of the National Guard of Ukraine is appointed by the president since 25 December 2015. Up until then, the commander was appointed by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) under a motion from the President.Turchynov proposes parliament appoint Poltorak as National Guard commander, Interfax-Ukraine (19 March 2014) = Azov Battalion = Named after the Sea of Azov the unit was created in Mariupol which is a major coastal city and operates as the capital of Donetsk Oblast due to the occupations of Donetsk by insurgents. The unit was one of the first battalions to form and begin to resist the rebels playing a large role in the defence of Mariupol. The battalion is mostly composed of Russian speaking volunteers from Eastern Ukraine and is headed by Andriy Biletsky. The unit is known for far right agenda and has been reported as displaying Nazi symbols. The unit denies the allegation that they use Nazi symbols claiming that their logo is based on the Coat of Arms of Ukraine while elements of the national flag are also used. It was upgraded into a full regiment in 2015, and is the only one with foreign soldiers in their ranks. It is also the NG's only territorial defence regiment in service. = Donbas Battalion = Semen Semenchenko, the leader and founder of the Donbas battalion wearing his trademark balaclava.The most well known and first volunteer battalion to form to resist Russian insurgents in the Donbass, often referred to as the \\"little black men\\" as an analog to Crimea's Little green men. The unit was conceived and is headed by Semen Semenchenko, an ethnic Russian. It formed from local ethnic Russian volunteers of the Donbass region who disagreed with the separatist philosophy and wished to remain part of Ukraine but were dissatisfied with the inaction of Ukrainian government forces in the area. In effect it is an analog of the separatist formed Vostok Battalion which formed from ethnic Russians fighting for separatism. Since its formation the unit became much more diverse accepting volunteers from all over Ukraine and foreign nations into their ranks, however ethnic Russians still make up the majority of the unit. The unit is one of the largest volunteer battalions in Ukraine with nearly 1,000 members and has participated in most major battles since the start of the War in Donbass. Despite being part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs‚Äô National Guard unit, battalion had received funding from various donors. The unit also aided in the defence of Mariupol when Russian forces invaded through Novoazovsk, the battalion sent several tank destroyers to slow the Russian advance. The offensive toward Mariupol was halted near Shyrokyne and Bezimenne. In September 2014 the unit was reorganized into a Regiment the bulk of which consisted of a 700-man Battalion Tactical Group. The Ministry of Defence stated that the unit would be armed with tanks and armored personnel carriers. A Spetsnaz unit within the battalion was also formed. The unit has been re-designated as the 3rd Reserve Battalion of the National Guard of Ukraine after being integrated into regular forces, but the Spetsnaz company remained.

Those signing up to be full-time members of the Guard will receive at least an additional four weeks of training. For those part-time members who complete their two-week training and return to their communities to await call-up, the authorities appear to be planning to implement a variation of the March battalion system; based where possible around existing civilian militias and armed groupings. Most of those use the sotnya as their basic unit, as does the National Guard itself. In March 2015, the National Guard of Ukraine received training from the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team. The training took place at the Yavoriv training center near the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. The 173rd Airborne paratroopers trained the Ukrainians on how to better defend themselves against \\"Russian and rebel artillery and rockets.\\" Training also included securing roads, bridges, and other infrastructure and treating and evacuating casualties.Fox News Officers and NCOs of the NGU are trained under the aegis of the National Guard Military Academy of Ukraine.

He is the head of Technology Transfer and Collaboration at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). On 26 January 2013, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri Award in the Discipline of Science and Engineering.  Nisargruna  Nisargruna is a biogas technology that uses biodegradable waste as an input and produces biogas as an output. The Nisargruna plant can process a variety of biodegradable wastes such as kitchen waste, grass, gobar (animal dung), dry leaves, animal carcasses, effluent sludge from textile manufacture, etc. The Nisargruna process is unique as it uses a combination of aerobic and anaerobic processes. In the first phase the biodegradable input (also called feedstock) is mixed with recycled water to form a slurry. This slurry enters a pre- digester tank where it undergoes an exothermic reaction that increases its temperature. In the second phase, this mixture enters the anaerobic digestion (AD) tank where methanogenesis takes place and methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are formed. While traditional AD plants yield a biogas with methane content of 55‚Äì65%, the Nisargruna plant with its two-phase process yields a biogas with methane content of 70‚Äì80%. The higher concentration of methane in the biogas means that it is a higher grade fuel. In addition to generating biogas, which may be used as a cooking or heating fuel, the Nisargruna plant also produces a weedless organic manure slurry. This slurry has a C:N (carbon to nitrogen) ratio of 12:1 to 16:1 and is a good organic soil conditioner. An independent study of a 0.5 TPD (tonnes per day) capacity Nisargruna plant conducted in 2015 showed that the plant had a payback period of less than three years. The Technology Transfer and Collaboration Department at BARC owns the intellectual property for the Nisargruna plant and has licensed it to over 50 companies () that may deploy it for their customers.

History =Naming= Udhwa is named after saint Uddhava of Mahabharat times, a friend of God Krishna and philosopher of Sankhya Yoga (Samkhya). It is believed that Udhwa was the place of Saint Uddhava. =Battle of Udhwa nala= The Battle of Udhwa nala between Mir Qasim, and the British (1763) was centered here. Mir Qasim was Nawab (King) of Bengal (including areas of present days Bangladesh and Indian states West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa). Nawab Mir Qasim was defeated by the British and fled with his family to the Rohtas, Bihar, but was not able to hide at the Rohtasgarh Fort, which the Diwan of Rohtas, Shahmal, finally handed over to British captain Goddard.

She expanded the first model agency specializing in plus-size models and petites. Her career has included multiple television appearances, fashion shows, seminars, and print media interviews, as well as two years each on QVC and HSN. She also had a ten-year plus-size pattern line for Simplicity Patterns, designed three other fashion lines, and authored several books.  Professional background  After graduating from Mount Holyoke College, Duffy's career direction started in the mid 1970s when she became one of the first plus-size models. She liked the work so much she decided, in 1979, to buy a start-up agency from Beth Kramer in NYC, immediately adding Petites, creating Big Beauties/Little Women, the first agency in the world specializing in plus-size models and petites. By 1984, Big Beauties/Little Women was successful enough to run national model searches advertised in the press. The prize included the cover of It‚Äôs Me magazine, a nationally published magazine for plus-size women. In 1987, her first book, \\"The H-O-A-X Fashion Formula\\", was published. In 1988, she sold her company to Ford Models, where she became Executive Director for Special Sizes until 2010. Ford renamed the division Ford 12+, and then Ford+. Duffy‚Äôs own career as a model included national campaigns for Gloria Vanderbilt, L'eggs, and Weight Watchers. In 1980, she began motivational speaking. In these lectures she advocates a message designed to enhance women's self-esteem. She has also commentated on more than 1250 fashion shows and seminars, and appeared on more than 800 television shows, including Today, Good Morning America, Sally Jesse Raphael, the Oprah Winfrey Show, Hard Copy, The Jenny Jones Show, and CNN. She has also done more than 600 print media interviews, including Cosmopolitan, Woman‚Äôs Day, Family Circle, Ladies Home Journal, New York Daily News, and New York Times. In her books, shows, and interviews, she has espoused the messages \\"Mattel made Barbie, but God made us,\\" and \\"God doesn‚Äôt make mistakes.\\" Concerned with the media's unattainable image of \\"perfection\\" generated by much of the fashion industry, Duffy offers advice and options on fashion and beauty for women. She states a personal belief that any woman, no matter what her age, size, height, finances, or features can (and should) develop her own unique personal style. Her message is that it's not what you've got, how much of it, or how old it is, but what you do with it is what matters. From 1991-93, she appeared regularly on QVC. In 1993, she introduced a successful pattern line for Simplicity Patterns, a collection of large-sized patterns based on her H-O-A-X body shapes. From 1997-99, she designed and presented a ready-to-wear clothing and accessory line for The Home Shopping Network, called \\"Personality\\" by Mary Duffy. The line was based on her theory that there are four distinct fashion personalities, which are defined by individual motivation: The Classic who dresses to be appropriate; The Dramatic who dresses to be noticed; The Casual who dresses to be comfortable; and The Artistic who dresses to be unique.  Personal  Born in New York and raised in New England, Duffy lives in Manhattan where she is a member of The Junior League and The Fashion Group. Since retiring from Ford Models in 2010, she has started a company to inform and encourage the self-esteem interests of all women, called Fashion 4 the Rest of Us. Besides \\"The H-O-A-X Fashion Formula\\", she has written two other books, \\"The Complete Petite\\", and \\"The MakeOver\\". She has also co-authored and self-published two more books with her husband, Marc Guerrero, a book of short stories, \\"East of Tiffany‚Äôs\\", and a book on advanced writing techniques, \\"Toolbox for Writers\\".

Each year the school safety data is reported by the District to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The North Allegheny School Board has provided the district's anti-bully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. In 2013, Highmark Foundation and the Pennsylvania Center for Safe Schools recognized Hosack Elementary School for demonstrating quality implementation of evidenced-based bullying prevention strategies. The school has implemented Olweus Bullying Prevention Program. The school was awarded a $1,250 prize. Parent electronic portal The District utilizes a Student Information System called Tyler SIS. The electronic Parent Portal is a web- based grade book and reporting system that provides parents access to student records related to their schedule and academic performance. The Parent Portal also provides parents with expanded capabilities, such as the opportunity to update demographic and contact information.

The film was directed by Rajni Basumatary and produced by Assam State Film (Finance & Development) Corporation Limited in association with Manna Films. The film was initially released on 7 February 2014 in the state of Assam and later on 7 March 2014 in selected theaters across rest of India via PVR Director's Rare.  Plot  Raag is set in Delhi where Radhika, a Hindustani singer, lives with her businessman husband Alok. They first met during one of Radhika's musical performances in Guwahati several years ago. Despite their different philosophies of life they fall in love with each other and get married. Due to Alok‚Äôs career change, they later relocate to Delhi. Even after seven years of marriage Alok is still not ready to become a father. He starts to ignore Radhika as an individual and as an artiste. Her music that apparently made him fall in love with her has now become unappealing. Radhika meets her neighbour Iqbal, a painter. Soon they become friends. Surajeet Sahay, whose terrace Iqbal has been using as his shelter and his studio for last ten years, wants Iqbal to vacate the place. The flat was actually Iqbal‚Äôs. He had to sell it to Sahay as Iqbal could not arrange money to send off his wife, Natalie (Natasha Mago), and daughter, Noor, to Prague. Iqbal had stayed back on the terrace of the flat, as he didn't want to stay away from the place that holds memories of his wife and daughter, Noor. Now Surajeet Sahay wants to sell off the flat and migrate to Canada. Radhika arranges an exhibition of Iqbal's painting to help him buy the house back. But she fails at that. Just then Partho, her childhood singer friend reappears in her life. He was secretly in love with Radhika but had let her go her way when he found out that she married Alok. With his great marketing and PR skills, Partho helps Radhika to organise another exhibition of Iqbal‚Äôs painting, which deservedly turns out to be a smashing hit. Iqbal gets his house back. Partho goes back to Guwahati. Alok, on the other hand, made love without precautions and impregnates his colleague Nandini during one of their business trips outside Delhi. Radhika came to know about it. But they both (Alok and Nandini) claim that it was just an accident and that there is no emotional involvement from either side. It is a decisive moment for Radhika to choose amongst Alok, Iqbal and Partho. The script does not show the decision Radhika made and leaves it open for interpretations. Flashforwarding to five years, the film ends with Radhika and Partho singing jugalbandi on a performance stage and Iqbal and a four-year-old girl sitting among the audience and enjoying the jugalbandi. Cast * Adil Hussain as Iqbal * Zerifa Wahid as Radhika * Kenny Basumatary as Alok * Kopil Bora as Partho * Natasha Mago as Natalie * Saumya Agarwal as Nandini * Rajni Basumatary as Socialite (cameo role)  Production  Raag is the directorial debut of Rajni Basumatary, who had earlier written and produced the critically acclaimed Assamese film Anurag. In an interview with The Times of India, Basumatary said that she likes to explore the complexity of human situations and that human emotions are universal, no matter where one is from. The entire film was shot in various locations in Delhi and Assam. The music of the film was scored by Chhattisgarhi musician Avinash Baghel. The music is highly influenced by Hindustani classical music. The soundtrack of the film was released on 15 January 2014 and contains 5 songs.. (4 February 2014). Retrieved on 16 March 2014.  Release  The film was first released on 7 February 2014 in the Indian state of Assam, a month ahead of all India release. Later, Raag was released in selected theaters across rest of India on 7 March 2014 via PVR Director's Rare. = Controversy = Despite performing quite well in the box office, Raag was removed after only one week run in the theaters of Assam allegedly by the distributors of Yash Raj Films to make room for their big budget Hindi film Gunday. This led to a controversy against Bollywood movies generally trying to suppress regional films.  Awards  Raag won three awards at the Prag Cine Awards 2014: Best Actor Male (for Adil Hussain), Best Art Direction (for Deepti Chawla and Archana Malhotra), and Best Makeup (for Akash Gogoi). It was nominated in 9 categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor Female, Best Supporting Actor Male, Best Music Direction, Best Lyrics, Best Playback Singer Female, and Best Costume Design.

History The island has several local names in addition to Fungu Kizimkazi, the most Notable of which are Fungu la Mbarak after the Arab who had the right to collect wreckage there in the reign of seyid Barghash who was the (Sultan of Zanzibar), Shungu Mbili and Shan jove. The island was featured on an early sixteenth century Portuguese map (Ingrams, n.d) but it derives its present name from the East Indian man Latham which rediscovered it in 1758. Zanzibar Administration on the Island The island was annexed to Zanzibar on 19 October 1898 when British First Minister Sir Lloyd Mathews under the order of the Sultan of Zanzibar visited the island, planted the Zanzibar Flag, and declared it to be under the administration of Zanzibar. Lloyd Mathews arrived on the island on 18 October 1898 with the warship HHS Barawa alongside Captain Arthur Agnew, Zanzibar Port Officer, and Dr. Alfred Andrew Spurrier, a Medical Officer. Following the Plantation of Zanzibar Flag on 19 October 1898, 21-gun salutes were performed as a military honor and the island was officially annexed to the Sultan's authority. An iron house was built; its corner stone was laid and written with \\"LATHAM ISLAND, FUNGU KIZIMKAZI UNDER ZANZIBAR SOVEREIGNTY\\". Geography Latham Island is a flat coral island located south-east of Unguja and east of Dar es Salaam. It is roughly long and wide, and has an area of . The island is surrounded by a fringing reef and is oceanic, as it lies off the continental shelf and is surrounded by deep water. Ecology The island is an important breeding ground for various bird species, namely the masked booby, greater crested tern, sooty tern and the brown noddy. Latham is also thought to be of importance for nesting turtles. Dispute Although the Island is under Zanzibar territorial water, controversy has emerged over the ownership of the Latham Island between Zanzibar and Tanzania Mainland, the Island is ruled by the United Republic of Tanzania and not under the Zanzibar jurisdiction.http://www.spearblog.com/2011/10/21/dogtooth-world-record-denied/ Some members of the House of Representatives in Zanzibar and Opposition leaders have been complaining about ownership of the Blocks and Latham Island.http://www.dailynews.co.tz/index.php/home-news/50728-who-owns-latham- island References Category:Uninhabited islands of Tanzania Category:Islands of Zanzibar Category:Zanzibar Archipelago ","title":"Latham Island"},{"id":"42216448","text":"Aquamicrobium aerolatum is a gram-negative, oxidase-positive, aerobic, rod- shaped, motile bacteria from the genus of Aquamicrobium which was isolated from air from a duck shed in Germany.UniProtDeutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen Defluvibacter lusatiensis was transferred to Aquamicrobium aerolatum.

The hams are prepared for consumption solely by the process of smoking, which preserves them, and are typically eaten thinly sliced in their preserved state without additional cooking.

In the early 1900s, there were three varieties of Westphalia ham: kugel cut, boneless and rolled, and regulation ham. In the early 1900s, significant quantities of Westphalian ham were being exported from Germany into the United States.

Its theme is war, but it also views itself as a memorial to peace. It was founded by the Gerstfeldh√∂he Society (Verein HGS Gerstfeldh√∂he)Society index no. 1358 at Amtsgericht Pirmasens and is run in cooperation with the town of Pirmasens.  Location  The \\"Westwall\\" museum lies underground in the former fortification of Gerstfeldh√∂he. The village of Niedersimten, two kilometres south of Pirmasens, is reached via Bitscher Stra√üe, which continues to Bitche over the French border. Two decommissioned tanks guard the entrance to the fortress and museum.  History  In the course of the building programme for the construction of the Siegfried Line (), during the Nazi era, work on the huge, bunker-like Gerstfeldh√∂he fortification began in 1938. Vaulted galleries, thousands of yards long, were blasted and hewn out of solid rock. It was intended to have an underground narrow gauge railway that would carry soldiers and military equipment over a distance of three miles to pre-planned battle positions on the nearby French border. After the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, the construction project was continued for another year before being abandoned. The Gerstfeldh√∂he tunnel system was used after the war until the early 1990s by the U.S. Army as a warehouse for vehicle spares. In the county of S√ºdwestpfalz alone, the U.S. Army had more than 20 such underground facilities.  Significance  The Siegfried Line, which was only partially completed, ran for about 400 miles from Weil on the Upper Rhine to Kleve on the Lower Rhine. It consisted of around 20,000 different military installations. After the war ended in 1945, most of the buildings were demolished or left to decay naturally. The fort at Gerstfeldh√∂he is one of the few well-preserved sites - probably because it was never in use during the war.  Visiting  The temperature throughout the fort is a constant 8 ¬∞C. It may be visited during the published visiting hours. During a one and a half hour guided tour, which runs for roughly a kilometre of tunnel partly hewn out of the rock, the visitor can see an impressive amount of military equipment, mainly received from private collectors. Also on the gallery walls may be seen the written comments and messages of American soldiers. Its artifacts include an armoury stocked with all types of weapon, including smaller items such as gas masks and machine guns as well as larger exhibits, for example, an anti- aircraft gun weighing more than two tons, large lorries, heavy motorcycles and a VW K√ºbelwagen. Soldiers quarters have been faithfully reconstructed. Mannequins are dressed in Wehrmacht and Nazi uniforms.

The First national architectural movement (), also referred to in Turkey as the National architectural Renaissance (), or Turkish Neoclassical architecture () was a period of Turkish architecture that was most prevalent between 1908 and 1930 but continued until the end of the 1930s. Inspired by Ottomanism, the movement sought to capture classical elements of Ottoman and Seljuk architecture and use them in the construction of modern buildings. Despite the style focusing on Ottoman aspects, it was most prevalent during the first decade of the Republic of Turkey. The most important architects of the movement were Ahmet Kemaleddin and Vedat Tek, who pioneered the movement, as well as Arif Hikmet Koyunoƒülu and Ottoman-born architect of Italian descent . History The Grand Post Office in Sirkeci, Istanbul, is considered to be the first building built in the Turkish Neioclassical style. The movement began in the early 20th-century in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople, with the goal of bringing back \\"Turkish\\" elements in the construction and design of new buildings. Ever since the late 18th century, European architectural movements such as Baroque, Neoclassical and Rococo architecture were the styles chosen for the majority of imperial buildings built up until the early 20th century. The first building considered to be built in the Turkish neoclassical style is the Grand Post Office (1905‚Äì09), by Vedat Bey in Sirkeci. The building brought back classical Ottoman elements from the 16th century such as two-color stone workmanship and Islamic geometric patterns. This kick-started the movement which was then given the name New Ottoman architecture. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the new government promoted Ottoman Revival architecture as a contrast to the many buildings built in western European styles. New government buildings as well as public buildings constructed during the last decade of the empire were mainly designed in the New Ottoman style such as the 7th Ey√ºp Re≈üadiye High-school (1911), Be≈üikta≈ü Pier (1913), Aviation Martyrs' Monument (1916) as well as the new headquarters for the Committee of Union and Progress, which would later become the first Grand National Assembly building when completed, in 1920. Even after the end of World War I, during the allied occupation of Constantinople, construction of new buildings continued in this style. The Tayyare Apartments, by Ahmet Kemaleddin, were built between 1918 and 1922, during the occupation. The Second Parliament building of Turkey (1924) was built in the Turkish Neoclassical style After the Turkish War of Independence and subsequent formation of the Republic of Turkey, the new government, led by President Mustafa Kemal, further promoted the architectural style which would live out its golden years in the 1920s. Subsequent government buildings such as the second Grand National Assembly building (1924), the Ministry of Finance general headquarters (1925) and the Ministry of Culture general headquarters (1927) were all built with Turkish Neoclassical architecture. Due to the high demand of buildings and lack of Turkish architects, Western influences once again took hold in the architecture of the 1930s. The Turkish government brought in several European architects, such as Clemens Holzmeister and Ernst Egli, to design many buildings during this period. This however did bring forth a mix of modern architecture with Turkish Neoclassical, most notably seen in the Sivas station building (1934). The mix of architectural styles led forth to the Second national architectural movement (1939-1950).

He ran as an independent candidate in the 2014 presidential election and was elected as President in the second round of voting. He has written two books about happiness, success and his life. Biography =Early and personal life= Kiska was born in Poprad. He studied electrical engineering. His father was an active member of the ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. He also applied for Communist party membership, but was rejected. Kiska was married to , an educator and politician from 1985 until 2001. They had two children, Andrej Kiska (1986) and Nat√°lia Kiskov√° (1990). The couple divorced in 2001 after 18 years of marriage. Kiska married his second wife, Martina Kiskov√°, in 2003. The couple have three children- - Veronika (born 2005), Viktor (born 2009), and Martin (born July 2017 during his presidency). =Career= In 1990, after the Velvet Revolution, he moved to the United States. Later he founded Triangel and Quatro, two Slovakia-based hire-purchase companies that give the buyer the possibility to pay for goods in several installments over a number of months instead of paying the full price at once. Tax authorities accused his co-owned company KTAG (with his brother Jaroslav) of tax non-compliance and under-payments, regarding expenses for his presidential campaign. The company eventually agreed to pay the taxes and a penalty. = Tax non-compliance and legal problems= Andrej Kiska's companies were involved in a number of tax-non compliance issues. Improperly reported income from various business activities resulted in a smaller VAT and Income tax payments. In his personal tax filing he did not disclose personal propagation before elections performed by his company as a non-cash income, but claimed that he paid for it. Eventually tax office confirmed he did not pay, did not report non-cash income, and his company did not report income from propagation activities but fully deducted all VAT. Remaining costs additionally decreased tax base. =Philanthropy= In 2006, Kiska co-founded a non-profit charitable organization called Dobr√Ω anjel (translated as Good Angel), in which donors help families that have found themselves in a difficult financial situation as a result of a family member contracting a serious disease (such as cancer). By 2016, more than 170,000 people have donated to this organization in Slovakia. In 2014 Good Angel expanded their activities also to Czech Republic, where 60.000 are paying their monthly contributions in 2016. In addition to that, Kiska donates his monthly presidential salary to people in need. Presidency Kiska (right) with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in February 2019 In the first round of the 2014 Slovak presidential election, Kiska placed second with 24% of the vote, behind Prime Minister Robert Fico (28%). As none of candidates got more than 50% of votes, Kiska and Fico progressed to a presidential runoff vote on 29 March 2014. With the support of right-wing parties and other defeated candidates, Kiska won decisively in the second round, receiving nearly 60% of the vote.\\"Millionaire Andrej Kiska elected first Slovak president with no communist past\\", Telegraph Online, 30 March 2014, accessed 30 March 2014. He took office on 15 June 2014. Kiska announced on 15 May 2018 that he will not participate in 2019 presidential election, arguing that his departure might end \\"the era of political confrontation\\" his country faced and citing a desire to spend more time with his family. At the time Kiska made the announcement, polls indicated that he was Slovakia's most trusted politician and that he would have likely been the frontrunner in the election had he chosen to present himself as a candidate. =Foreign policy= Kiska supports Kosovo independence and is in favour of Slovakia diplomatically recognising Kosovo as an independent sovereign state. Kiska has also come out against Russia over the Ukraine conflict and supports sanctions.

It will act as a tunnel bypass of the congested Pennant Hills Road, connecting the M1 Pacific Motorway to the M2 Hills Motorway. It will also be the longest and deepest road tunnel in Australia after the M8 Tunnel. The road has also colloquially been referred to as the \\"missing link\\", because its construction will complete the combination of the Sydney Orbital Network and its north-south motorway links to the National Highway. NorthConnex was first known as the F3 to M2 link, with F3 referring to F3 Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle Freeway, the previous name of M1 Pacific Motorway. It was then renamed the M1 to M2 link in 2013 when the F3 was renamed M1 Pacific Motorway. The NorthConnex name was announced in March 2014.  Alignment  NorthConnex will be a tolled motorway tunnel linking the M1 Pacific Motorway at Wahroonga to the M2 Hills Motorway at West Pennant Hills. NorthConnex will be integrated within the existing Sydney Orbital Network and the need for integration work at either end has been identified to enable the safe merge of traffic on and off the M1 and M2 optimising motorway performance. The northern and southern interchanges will be constructed to accommodate connections to Pennant Hills Road at either end of the tunnel. The tunnel will allow motorists to bypass 21 sets of traffic lights along Pennant Hills Road, meaning drivers will not encounter a single traffic light from Melbourne to Newcastle. NorthConnex will also form an alternative route between the Pacific Motorway and the Sydney CBD via the M2 and Lane Cove Tunnel, bypassing 40 traffic lights along the Pacific Highway. =Exits and interchanges= Toll =Pricing= Toll prices on NorthConnex will be aligned with the toll prices on M2 Hills Motorway, which are 7.99 for cars and 23.97 for heavy vehicles . Toll prices would increase in line with the proposed concession agreement with the Government, ending in 2048. =Pennant Hills Road regulation= When NorthConnex opens, trucks and buses over 12.5 metres long or over 2.8 metres clearance height travelling between the M1 and M2 are forbidden to use Pennant Hills Road and must use the NorthConnex tunnels instead, unless they have a genuine destination only accessible via Pennant Hills Road. Trucks and buses will be monitored by two gantries located along Pennant Hills Road, one at Normanhurst and one at Beecroft / West Pennant Hills. A fine of 194 with no demerit points will also be imposed on truck and bus drivers detected (with the use of cameras mounted on gantries) using Pennant Hills Road with the traffic flow. An exception applies to vehicles transporting dangerous goods and oversize vehicles approved to use Pennant Hills Road.  History  =Past proposals= The M1 Pacific Motorway, then known as the F3 Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle Freeway, was originally planned to continue as the Lane Cove Valley Expressway, which was to join the North Western Expressway, leading to the Sydney Central Business District via Gladesville Bridge and the Western Distributor, but those plans were cancelled in 1977. By the time the F3 was extended to Wahroonga in 1989, there was no plan for a motorway route continuing beyond that location. In 2001, at the same time as announcing Westlink M7, the Federal Government proposed that the M7 would form part of a bypass route, with a new road branching off the F3 Freeway near Mount White and crossing the Hawkesbury River with a new high- level bridge to join the M7 at its distinct northwestern corner at Dean Park. Hence, the road would avoid the steep grades of the Mount White section of the F3 immediately north of the existing low-level bridges across the Hawkesbury River and would be a quite direct bypass of Sydney that would be separated from much of Sydney's commuter traffic. A study was undertaken into options for connecting the F3 with the M7. At the preliminary stage of that study, the then Roads and Traffic Authority decided that the primary goal of the new road was the best possible relief of traffic on the existing route, Pennant Hills Road. Corridors for that proposal were broadly defined as types A, B and C. *Type A options were essentially from the existing end of the F3 to somewhere on the M2. *Type B corridors branched off the F3 in the vicinity of Berowra and crossed the environmentally sensitive Galston Gorge. *Type C corridors were along the general lines of the Federal Government proposal. The need to reduce traffic on Pennant Hills Road made the reduction of commuter traffic more urgent than that of traffic bypassing Sydney. As such, type B and C options were rejected early in the planning process. Four type A options were identified. All involved extensive tunnelling. One of these, following the Hornsby - Epping railway line near the F3 and underneath Pennant Hills Road towards the M2, was selected as the preferred option. On 17 February 2007, The Hon. Jim Lloyd MP (the federal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) announced the establishment of an independent review of the F3 to M7 Corridor Selection. The review was carried out by The Hon. Mahla Pearlman , who is a former Chief Judge of the NSW Land and Environment Court. The report was released on 14 September 2007. The conclusions of the report were that the proposed tunnels should proceed but that planning for the longer term connection between the F3 and the M7 should also commence immediately. =Project revival= In 2013, the F3 became known as the M1 Pacific Motorway. Plans to construct the M1 to M2 link tunnels were announced that year. The link between the M1 and M2 is recognised in the NSW Government's State Infrastructure Strategy and the Transport for NSW Long Term Transport Master Plan as important infrastructure for freight traffic and the wider connectivity within NSW to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow along Pennant Hills Road. In 2013, The National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA) identified the arterial, Pennant Hills Road as the third worst road in NSW and the ACT. This rating reflected the level of frustration experienced by road users. Traffic congestion is often associated with poor road safety and further compounding congestion into off-peak period. The rate of accidents along the arterial strip was significantly higher when compared to the NSW average. In 2011, Infrastructure NSW's 20-year State Infrastructure Strategy report released in 2012 claimed that Pennant Hills Road carries approximately 80,000 vehicles per day. The Environmental Impact Statement of the project released in July 2014 showed that Pennant Hills Road carried approximately 62,000 vehicles per day, out of which roughly 10% were heavy vehicles. The average daily traffic volume continued to remain at the same numbers in the next few years, according to Transport for NSW's Traffic Volume Viewer. The proposed tunnel can carry more than 100,000 vehicles per day (50,000 in each direction). On 16 March 2014, the NSW Government reached an agreement with Transurban and the Westlink M7 shareholders to deliver the tunnel link. It was also announced that the tunnel link would be known as NorthConnex.  Funding  The 3 billion, consisting of a construction budget of A$2.65 billion in addition to land and project delivery costs, will be funded through toll charges and a contribution from the NSW and Australian Governments of up to A$405 million each.  Criticism  There was community opposition and criticism to a proposed ventilation exhaust to be built for the tunnels near schools in Sydney. There is also some contention within the local community about how successful the chosen route option will be in easing traffic congestion on Pennant Hills Road. Ku-ring-gai Council has also raised a significant concern that the current proposal does not address the worsening traffic on the Pacific Highway from Wahroonga through to the Gore Hill Freeway at Artarmon. To help address this, construction of east-facing tunnel ramps under Pennant Hills Golf Course to the M2 Motorway may be considered in the future if required. = Construction = Along with the announcement of the NorthConnex name in March 2014, the Lendlease Bouygues joint venture was announced as the preferred construction contractor for the project. Approval for the construction and operation of NorthConnex was granted in January 2015 by the NSW Minister of Planning. Australian motorway operator, Transurban and its partners in the Westlink M7 were awarded the contract to build, maintain and operate NorthConnex. Preliminary work activities started on 5 February 2015 and continued until major construction began in mid-2015. Tunnelling began in April 2016 and finished in October 2018. In conjunction with Hornsby Shire Council, the spoil removed from NorthConnex tunnelling was used to fill Hornsby Quarry to enable rehabilitation of the old quarry into a new public parkland. The project was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019 but has been delayed into 2020 with the contractor citing the depth of the tunnel (90m) as presenting challenges to the construction time frame. It was estimated to be open during the third quarter of 2020, but was further delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is a suburb of Dassel and was incorporated into this city in 1974. It is located between the Amtsberge and the Elfas hills. History The foundation of L√ºthorst dates back to the 9th century, when it was a part of the Suilbergau area. Throughout the Middle Ages, both the Counts of Dassel and lords who had their castle in the Homburg Forest, had influence on the village. In the decades after 1310, when the Counts of Dassel ceased to exist, the Lords of Homburg expanded their influence and expelled some of the inhabitants from the village. As the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hildesheim was the successor of the county of Dassel, bishop Gerhard tried to limit the influence of those lords. So did Pope Gregory XI, who mandated the abbot of the Reinhausen monastery. However the lords prevailed and the expelled inhabitants of L√ºthorst settled in Lindau. Several years later they undertook an attack against the lords, burning down 14 villages around L√ºthorst. Six of these became abandoned villages. Early in the 15th century the lords became extinct. The Dukes of Grubenhagen were their heirs, because duke Otto II had married the widow of the last lord of Homburg. The remaining farmers of L√ºthorst had to serve them according to the fief rights. They became independent farmers as a result of the Prussian Agricultural reforms early in the 19th century. Main sights medieval church tower * The local church is devoted to Magnus of F√ºssen. In the Middle Ages, people believed that he could help them against the wilderness surrounding the village. The tower of the church is dated into the 10th century.

The church had two bells both from 1316, but only one is left because the Nazis melted the other one in 1942. * In memory of Wilhelm Busch, who lived here from time to time between 1846 and 1897, a showroom can be visited.

Most active in the 1830s, she usually worked in water-colour, commonly painting scenes of domestic life. Biography =Early life= Best was born in York in 1809, the daughter of doctor Charles Best, (associated with Bootham Park Hospital from 1804‚Äì1815) and his wife, Mary Norcliffe Dalton. Best grew up on Little Blake Street near the York Minster. At the age of six (1815), Best's family moved to Nice in France for three years, where Mary Ellen Best's father died in 1817; the family returned to England in 1818. Mary Ellen's father left ¬£1,000 to both her and her sister, to be inherited at the age of 21. Best attended a boarding school in her teens during which time she received lessons from a well qualified art teacher, George Haugh. Like many middle‚Äìclass women, she was educated in painting and drawing for leisurely pleasure and to attract a suitable husband. However, she achieved a level of success above that of an amateur, and she decided to continue her artistic pursuits. =Later life= After 1828, she left boarding school and started to demonstrate her dedication to art. She was tutored by George Haugh (1755‚Äì1827), an art exhibitor. She continued her art in York, her hometown, and between 1830 and 1836, her most active years as an artist, Best exhibited at venues in London, Leeds, Newcastle, York, and Liverpool. In 1830, one of her still lifes was awarded a silver medal from the London Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (now the Royal Society of Arts) as \\"the best original composition, painted in oil or water-colours . . . by persons under the age of twenty-one.\\" During 1834, the height of her artistic life, she visited Frankfurt, Germany, where she developed her skills further and sold more paintings. In 1840 Best married Johann Anton Phillip Sarg, a schoolteacher who would have had access to considerably fewer funds than Best. Best's mother was a part of the Norcliffe family, who owned the Langton Park estate. This meant that on her father's death she inherited a substantial fortune. It has been suggested that her inherited wealth was the reason Best withdrew from her artistic career in the 1850s. During their marriage, the couple had three children, who she occasionally painted, namely Francis Charles Anton Sarg (21 Dec 1840 - 31 Dec 1921), Caroline Elisabeth Sarg (later Scriba, 18 Jan 1842-d.?) and James Frederick Sarg (16 Aug 1843 - 1917). Her two sons, sometimes referred to as Frank (or Franz) and Frederick (or Fred) both moved to Guatemala in later life, and eventually became involved in export business based from Coban as Sarg Hrnos (i.e. Sarg Brothers), especially of Coffee. The eldest brother later became diplomatic consul representing Germany in Guatemala whereafter his son Anthony Frederick Sarg moved to the United state and became famous as a puppeteer and illustrator known as Tony Sarg. Best died in 1891 in Darmstadt. Artworks An Interior, a drawing by Best, c.1837‚Äì1840 The Sideboard Contrary to the common practice of her day, Mary Ellen Best was interested in portraying domestic life in her paintings, including families at tables, kitchens, and domestic workers. She painted a number of water-colour images of her home in Castlegate, York, including interior portraits of the drawing room, dining room (painted in 1838), and one of herself working in her painting room. She also painted other houses including the drawing room of Naburn Hall, which was then home to George Palmes. After marrying Johan Anton and moving to Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Worms, and Darmstadt, she continued to paint the houses they lived in. Between 1828 and 1840, two-thirds of Best's portraits were commissioned by women. Caroline Davidson, who wrote a biography of Best, calculated that she produced more than 1,500 paintings in total. Some of Best's drawings were handed down to her great-granddaughter, and 47 were sold in January 1983 in New York City, though York Art Gallery obtained three of them. Others were sold by her great- grand-nephew a year later. The paintings are of historical interest as a record of Yorkshire and European life in the 1830s and 1840s.

History  In 1848, the German revolution began. Liberal pressure spread through many of the German states, each of which experienced the revolutions in its own way. The street demonstrations of workers and artisans in Paris, France, from February 22 through 24, 1848, resulted in the abdication of King Louis Philippe and his departure from France to live in Britain, was the immediate spur to revolt in Germany.See the Foreword written by S. Z. Leviova to the book called The Revolution of 1848: Articles from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (International Publishers: New York, 1972) p. 7. The revolution spread across Europe and started in Germany with the large demonstrations on March 13, 1848, in Vienna, Austria, which resulted in the resignation of Prince von Metternich as chief minister to Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and his departure from Austria to live in Britain. Because of the date of these demonstrations, the revolutions in Germany are usually called the March Revolution (German: M√§rzrevolution). On 17 March 1848, Ferdinand Freiligrath wrote a poem dedicated to these events. It incites all Germans to take up arms in order to liberate Germany from its princes and create a united German republic under the black, red and golden flag.

Early life  Jung Doo-hong was born in 1966 in Chilsan-ri, Imcheon-myeon, Buyeo County, South Chungcheong Province, the youngest of seven siblings. As a child, he was small for his age and had an unusually shy and introspective personality. His life changed dramatically when a private Taekwondo institute opened near his high school when he was a freshman student, and he became engrossed in the traditional Korean martial art, practicing taekwondo every day. Because he was so poor, he could not afford to pay his training fees; the master of the institute, Lee Gak-soo, taught him taekwondo for free because he recognized Jung's passion and talent. In 1985, he entered Incheon Junior College as an athletics/physical education major. He was also selected as a member of a performing team that promoted taekwondo and Korean culture around the world, and spent much of his college years overseas, teaching taekwondo in the United States, Japan and Mexico. During his mandatory military service, he served as a martial arts trainer of a frontline elite unit, followed by a brief stint as a bodyguard for a parliamentarian after his discharge from the military.  Career  = Debut as stuntman = A friend on his bodyguard team recommended Jung as a stuntman. But in 1990, the compensation and benefits that Korean stuntmen received were meager at best, and Jung was hired only to carry heavy equipment for the stunt acting team on a direct-to-video film he applied for. Deeply disappointed, he temporarily quit stunt work; instead, every day he underwent intensive exercise at Boramae Park to improve his physical strength, and continued learning various martial arts such as aikido, hapkido, kickboxing and fencing under Kim Young-mo at a nearby training center from 11 p.m. until dawn. Three months later, he was hired as a stuntman for actor Lee Il-jae on Im Kwon-taek's hit movie General's Son (1990). = Action director = He quickly rose up the ranks to become the action director (also called stunt coordinator, martial arts director, or fight director) on the 1992 film Sirasoni (\\"Bobcat\\"), making him, at age 25, the youngest to hold that job in Korean film history. In the succeeding years, Jung undisputedly became the country's most important and influential action director, remaining in the center of Korean movie action by directing/choreographing action for 4 to 6 movies per year. He was responsible for designing the street shooting in Shiri (1999), the wrestling in The Foul King (2000), the western spectacle in The Good, the Bad, the Weird (2008), and the hand-to-hand combat and wire work in The Berlin File (2013). Constantly innovating, Jung is the acknowledged creator of \\"Koreanized\\" action, the rough-and-realistic Korean style of action and fight choreography. = Seoul Action School = Jung listed Park No-sik and Jang Dong-hwi among the Korean action film actors that he respects, saying, \\"I thought it was very cool to wear a formal hat and throw blows at the enemy and rescue women. But when I debuted [as a stuntman], it was during the days when stuntmen were treated as less than human.\\" Things have changed since then, but Jung believes working conditions for present-day stuntmen can still be improved further. This, and his commitment, passion and pride regarding the action/martial arts filmmaking in Korea are part of the reason he founded the Seoul Action School at a gymnasium in Boramae Park on July 1, 1998. He jointly established the facility with four of his younger colleagues with the aim of producing and nurturing martial arts directors and stuntmen. As of 2006, the school had 25 key members, and recruits new members every six months offering them free martial arts training. It later expanded and moved to Paju, Gyeonggi Province in 2009. Jung has spoken with candor about the difficulties of maintaining a stunt company in a country that he believes does not appreciate the action genre at all, but he is glad that young prospective actors at the Seoul Action School now seem to be proud to get into the action genre. Jung continues to be an advocate for safe working conditions and adequate compensation for stuntmen in Korea. = International projects = Besides Korean cinema, Jung was the action director for the 2002 Japanese film Seoul („ÇΩ„Ç¶„É´) by Masahiko Nagasawa, and the 2007 Russian blockbuster Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan (–ª–ù–ú–¶–ù–ö) by Sergei Bodrov. He was also the stunt double for actor Lee Byung-hun in Lee's Hollywood films G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Red 2 (both in 2013). = Acting = Longtime friend and collaborator, director Ryoo Seung-wan has spoken of how he greatly appreciates Jung's stubbornness when providing creative input in his films' action scenes. Jung, who has appeared onscreen in minor and supporting parts throughout his career, has had his most significant acting roles in Ryoo's movies, particularly as the villain in action-comedy-fantasy Arahan (2004). In 2006, Ryoo cast Jung and himself in the leading roles in The City of Violence, about two friends who reunite in their hometown and go after the bad guys who killed their friend. Jung said he had wanted to be in a film that was \\"simply action\\" (without romance or suspense) and thought, \\"This was my last chance [to appear in an action movie]. So I wanted to show everything I had.\\" = Boxing = In 2005 Jung (by then already in his forties) made his debut as a professional boxer in the welterweight division. He also opened a fitness center with TV host Lee Hoon, called \\"Double H Multi Gym.\\"http://doublehmg.com/  Personal life  Jung married Indonesian-Australian model and former MTV Asia VJ Nadya Hutagalung in 1998, but the union ended within a year; Hutagalung later said the marriage wasn't officially registered.

Biography He was born in Bhonsle family. Upon the death of his father, the infant Shivaji was installed as the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire with his mother Tarabai serving as the regent in 1700. His cousin, Chhattrapati Shahu upon his release from the Mughals in 1707 successfully challenged Tarabai to become the next Chhatrapati. Tarabai then set up a rival court in Kolhapur. Shivaji II served as Raja of Kolhapur from 1710 to 1714. At that time, he was once again deposed by his step-mother Rajasbai who installed her own son, Sambhaji II on the Kolhapur throne. Shivaji died of smallpox on 14 March 1726. Kolhapur State Shivaji II posthumously became father of a son, later called Rajaram II of Satara who was brought up in obscurity for his own protection. When Shahu, without a male heir to succeed to his throne, wanted to adopt a son, Tarabai disclosed this fact to him in late 1740s. Shahu adopted Rajaram II who succeeded Shahu as the Chhatrapati following Shahu's death.

Her research group at IISc uses molecular genetics and functional genomics to understand various aspects of how gene activity is regulated in yeasts and plants. Since joining IISc, one of Vijayaraghavan's research aims is to study genes that control flowering and plant morphology.  Research Interests  The department of microbiology and cell biology, under the guidance of Prof Vijayraghavan, are interested in understanding the eukaryotic gene regulation at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels using molecular genetics and functional genomics. The effects of such regulated gene expression on cell division and differentiation are being studied. In particular, the molecular genetic studies of pre-mRNA splicing factors; the spliceosome whose assembly is necessary for the two pre-mRNA splicing reactions. They use genetic and biochemical approaches to study spliceosome assembly, splicing reactions and the impact of pre-mRNA splicing on global gene expression. Another project is looking into the regulatory genes controlling cell fate and cell proliferation during flower development. The overall goals are to understand the network of interactions between transcription factors and signaling molecules that controls organ formation from meristems (with stem cells). As a model system they study the formation of the rice flowering stem (inflorescence) and floral organs to elucidate functions for transcription factors in patterning.

The main character is the Roman sleuth Gordianus the Finder. Plot summary It is the year 88 BC. The young Gordianus is living in Alexandria with his beloved slave Bethesda. When Bethesda disappears, he learns that she has been kidnapped by bandits, and must set out on a dangerous journey into the Nile Delta, accompanied only by the young slave boy Djet. There he ends up having to join the criminal gang known as The Cuckoo's Nest, led by the young but charismatic Artemon, and must go with them back to Alexandria to help Artemon steal the golden sarcophagus of Alexander the Great while the city is erupting in violence around them. The story is set against the backdrop of the struggle between the brothers Ptolemy X Alexander and Ptolemy IX Lathyros over the throne of Egypt, as well as the struggle between Rome and Mithridates. Critical reception Writing in USA Today, Robert Bianco found the book to be an ‚Äúexuberantly entertaining prequel‚Äù adding that ‚Äúyoung or old, Gordianus remains one of modern fiction's most humanely complex detective creations‚Äù, and concluding ‚Äúthis is a raid we can all enjoy‚Äù.

It was released after the fabrication of the Crown Script to be a manual of sorts.  Crown Script  The Crown script (Arabic: ÿÆÿ∑ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿßÿ¨‚ÄîKhat al Taj)‚Äîis a modern Arabic script fabricated by Egyptian calligrapher Mohammad Mahfouz in 1931 and proposed by then-King Fuad (also spelt Fouad) the First. The purpose of inventing this script was to implement capital letters into the Arabic script to be used similarly to English capital letters‚Äîwhich it does very well. Capital Crown Letters are different from small letters in a sense that they possess a loop‚Äîor an upside-down ŸÑÿß‚Äîon top of them; letters that may connect to the next letter also connect to that loop, whereas letters that do not connect to the next letter also don‚Äôt connect to that loop. In 1932, the Egyptian Ministry of Education released a manifesto titled Crown Letters and Punctuation Marks and Their Positions of Use,https://www.scribd.com/doc/207119358/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%88-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%85 which thoroughly explained the script and was very likely the first book ever written in Crown script. Punctuation was also included because, in fact, there were no set rules for Arabic writing and everyone wrote as they pleased; as such, punctuation was just thrown anywhere into a sentence for aesthetic purposes rather than simplifying sentences to make concepts easier to grasp for the reader. Even now, punctuation is very badly abused‚Äîthis is most obvious on social networking websites. The manifesto concluded that [see below for supplements]: # Big letters as shown in supplement one are to be called Crown Letters; taking into account the form in which these letters are enthroned and because they were developed under the will of the Crown. # Punctuation marks are to be used as shown in supplement two. # Crown Letters are to be used as shown in supplements three and four. # The Ministry of Education may use all the wherewithal necessary to popularize the use of the Crown Letters and punctuation marks and all that is required by the implementation of that from integrating them into curricula to the promulgation of their benefits to the crowds to the facilitation of their use in the press. More accurately, however, the Crown script isn‚Äôt really a script of its own; it‚Äôs more of an addition to existing scripts. The Ministry of Education‚Äôs manifesto specified that Crown Letters may be used with Naskh and Rok‚Äôa scripts. You may find a PDF version of the book here.

The street is one of the oldest streets in Chennai and is believed to be the longest street in the city. Running north‚Äìsouth, the street connects Poonamallee High Road at Park Town in the south with North Wall Road‚ÄìOld Jail Road Junction at Washermanpet in the north. Running parallel to the Wall Tax Road, another historical thoroughfare in the city, the street passes through thickly populated residential and commercial areas of the historical neighbourhood. History In the 16th century, Madras Synagogue and Jewish Cemetery was established on the street by a Portuguese Jewish trader, Jacques de Paiva. It was later moved to Lloyd's Road and became the Lloyd's Road Jewish Cemetery. In the early 18th century, washers and bleachers employed by the British East India Company for its cloth business settled around the street, given it the name 'Washers' Street'. Several of them were Telugu speaking, followed by the middlemen or dubashes (men who knew two languages), chiefly Telugu-speaking Komutti and Beri Chetties. By the 1740s, Gujaratis and Saurashtrians from the Saurashtra region closely associated with the cloth trade settled down in the area to the west of the street. Soon, the area also became home to Marwaris, who were chiefly pawn brokers and money lenders. Mint Street thus became a confluence of various language speakers, which has remained so till date. In 1841‚Äì1842, the East India Company moved its coin-making facility to this street, and since then the street became known as Mint Street. Later the mint was converted as the Government Press, which still functions. Next to the Press stood Crown Talkies, one of the city's earliest cinema theatres built by a photographer named Ragupathy Venkaiah, who also built other theatres such as Gaiety and Globe in various parts of the city. The street also housed Muragan Theatre, where Kalidasa, the first Tamil talkie, was released. The city's first ticketed Carnatic concert was conducted in this street in the 1880s for a concert by Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan at the Thondaimandalam Thruva Vellalar School, which is now in a dilapidated condition. The concept, however, did not succeed. In 1889, the Hindu Theological School was established, where the legendary C. Saraswathi Bai gave her first harikatha performance in 1909, becoming the first woman to do so. The school was visited by Mahatma Gandhi in 1896. The present-day street The street is known for its authentic Rajasthani cuisine, which Marwaris believe is only available in this area. The memorial house of savant Ramalinga Swamigal is located near the northern end of the street, in Veerasami Street, a lane off Barracks Street. The street houses two historic schools, namely the Tondaimandalam Tuluva Vellalar (TTV) School, founded in 1854, and the Hindu Theological School, founded in 1889. The TTV School was home to one of the earliest music sabhas‚Äîthe Tondaimandalam Sabha. It was at a meeting of this Sabha at the school in 1905 that the decision to celebrate the Aradhana of Tyagaraja in a grand manner at Thiruvaiyaru was taken by a large group of musicians. Mint Street housed several bhajan centres (bhajanai mandirams), to nurture the bhajan tradition of Carnatic music, of which at least two still survive. One of these centres has transformed into a temple. Known as the 'Sumai tangi' (load-bearing) Rama temple, it has two exquisite Thanjavur paintings of Rama and Narasimha, which were the original objects of worship before the erection of stone idols. In a talk that Tiger Varadachariar gave over the All India Radio, composers and music publishers Tachur Singaracharlu Brothers organised bhajan sessions at this temple in the 1890s. Mint Street has several temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha. Kandaswami Temple, dedicated to Lord Murugan, is located on Rasappa Chetty Street, off Mint Street.

He was the first Mayor of Kenosha, Wisconsin, and is regarded as the father of Wisconsin public schools. Early life Michael Frank was born in Virgil, New York, his father, John Frank, was an immigrant from the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel, in modern day western Germany. He came to America for economic opportunity, but arrived in the midst of the American Revolutionary War and decided to join the rebel cause. At the end of the war he was granted an honorable discharge and received a grant of land. Through toil, he transformed the wild land into a farm where Michael was raised. From an early age he developed an interest in reading and study. He consumed books and newspapers, and was eager to engage in conversation about public affairs. He became interested in social reform movements as a young man and was involved with the temperance and abolitionist movements while living in New York. At the time, abolitionism was seen as a fringe ideology and the few abolitionist papers in the country were denounced by the major parties and their publications. Nevertheless, Frank subscribed to the abolitionist paper the Emancipator, but his postmaster refused to deliver it until he pledged not to distribute it further. Wisconsin He moved to Southport, Wisconsin Territory, (now Kenosha, Wisconsin) with his wife, Caroline, in October 1839. Here he sought to continue his social causes. A few months after his arrival he organized a lyceum which became influential in the young settlement. He also resumed his interest in the Temperance movement, participating in the first temperance convention in the territory and drafting an address for the Wisconsin Enquirer to advocate the temperance issue. In January 1840 he met Christopher Latham Sholes, and, in June of that year, they partnered to publish and co-edit the Southport Telegraph. The paper was continuously published for many years, supported the temperance, free soil, and anti-slavery movements. Frank then founded the first literary magazine in Wisconsin in 1843: The Garland of the West. He was active in encouraging literary and lecture interests in Kenosha. In 1860 he hosted a number of prominent lecturers, including Horace Greeley, Frederick Douglass, and John P. Hale. Frank was commissioned Colonel of the 4th regiment of Wisconsin militia by Governor Henry Dodge in 1840. The title \\"Colonel\\" stuck with Mr. Frank for the rest of his life, though he did little actual work with the militia. Territorial Legislature When Southport was organized as a village, Frank was elected the first Village President, in 1840. He was elected to represent Racine County (which, at the time, included all of present day Kenosha County) on the Wisconsin Territorial Council. In the Council, he advocated for moving Wisconsin toward statehood, and wrote the first report for the territory to advocate a statehood plan. There was, at the time, still some resistance to statehood as it would mean taking on expenses that were currently being covered by federal dollars. Perhaps the issue he is best known for was his act passed during the 1845 session, after several earlier attempts, to establish a free public school in Southport. He had begun advocating for the concept in the Telegraph in 1840 and continued in various forms. Initially, childless Southport residents thought that it was unreasonable to tax them to pay for schools, but the village eventually approved. His idea proved popular when framed that education was public property and essential to good government. Other free school systems emerged in the territory, and ultimately the idea of tax-supported public schools was incorporated into Article X of the Wisconsin Constitution. After Wisconsin became a state, Frank was chosen by the legislature as one of three commissioners to adapt the territorial laws to the new state government. Frank took charge of creating the public school code, which was adopted in the 1849 session of the legislature. Mayor and later years Frank was chosen as the first mayor of Kenosha after its incorporation as a city in 1850. His time as Mayor was marked by two major incidents. The first was the \\"Wheat Revolt\\" in which a number of farmers who had stored their crop at warehouses in Kenosha became alarmed by a rumor that wheat was being stolen. Mayor Frank was able to keep the peace during days of threats and incitements until a company of militia arrived from Milwaukee to ensure peace and restore confidence in the marketplace. The second major incident was a Cholera outbreak which claimed a number of lives. He became associated with the Republican Party at the time of its formation, and was elected as a Republican to the 1861 session of the Wisconsin State Assembly. He went on to work as Postmaster of Kenosha and a Regent of the University of Wisconsin from 1861 to 1866. From 1870 to 1882, he worked in the United States Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. He returned to Kenosha after his federal service and retired from public life.

The House District 115 position in Dallas County opened in 2011, when the incumbent Republican Jim Jackson declined to seek re-nomination. Bennett Ratliff and four other candidates then entered the Republican primary held on May 29, 2012, nearly three months later than usual. Steve Nguyen led the primary with 3,081 votes (35 percent), followed by Ratliff with 2,644 (30.1 percent), 306 votes more than the third-place candidate, Matt Rinaldi, who polled 2,338 votes (26.6 percent). Two other candidates held the remaining 8.3 percent of the ballots cast. Ratliff then defeated Nguyen in the runoff election, 4,763 (51.9 percent) to 4,409 (48.1 percent). In the November 6 general election, Ratliff prevailed with 29,082 votes (55.3 percent) to 21,784 (41.4 percent) for the Democrat Mary Clare Fabishak (born c. 1949) of Irving and another 1,711 votes (3.3 percent) for the Libertarian Party nominee, Preston Poulter. Representative Ratliff served on the House committees of (1) Appropriations and (2) Public Education. He authored eighteen bills and by the end of the session, thirteen of his priority issues had become law, the best record of any freshman in the 83rd Legislative Session. He received high marks for his tenure in the legislature. Outgoing Texas Comptroller Susan Combs and Texas Monthly magazine cited him for \\"outstanding leadership\\" among freshman House members. The Dallas Morning News called Ratliff the \\"Best of Dallas-Area's Freshman Class in the Texas House\\" and nominated him for \\"Texan of the Year in Education\\". In his bid for a second term, Ratliff lost the Republican nomination to a 2012 tea party opponent, Matt Rinaldi, who received 4,167 votes (50.6 percent) to Ratliff's 4,075 votes (49.44 percent) in the March 4, 2014 Republican primary. Rinaldi, an Irving lawyer and one of Ratliff's opponents two years before, had extensive support from a special interest PAC, Empower Texans. On March 1, 2016, Ratliff tried unsuccessfully to regain his seat, but lost again to the Empower Texans backed Rinaldi in the Republican primary 8,804 to 7,668 (53.45% to 46.55%) In the 2018 General Election, Ratliff broke with the Republican Party to endorse Democratic candidate Julie Johnson for Ratliff's former Texas House seat, due to the need for the legislature to address Ratliff's top priority, Texas' Public Education Finance system. Ratliff proved to be correct in his support, as Johnson went on to win the seat with a double-digit margin over Matt Rinaldi, and became the first Democratic representative to co-author House Bill 3 to reform and overhaul the Texas School finance system, a bill that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican Governor Greg Abbott. Legislative positions Ratliff took a leadership role in education issues and helped pass HB 5 to reform high school graduation requirements in Texas which passed the House unanimously. He also authored and passed HB 2824 to reduce state regulation of high-performing public schools and HB 2824 to reduce high-stakes testing in public schools. Despite unanimous support of both bills in the House and Senate, the bills were vetoed by Governor Rick Perry on very narrow grounds. Ratliff supported the bill to establish a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for low income students in public schools; the measure passed the House, 73-58. He supported popular legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate law- enforcement entity. Because of this work on behalf of the children of Texas, Ratliff has been named to the \\"Legislative Honor Roll\\" by the Texas PTA and recognized as a legislative \\"Champion\\" by the Retired Teachers Association. The Texas PTA also selected Ratliff to receive one of their highest honors by naming him an Honorary Life Member for outstanding service to the children and youth of Texas. Ratliff co-sponsored the successful bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses and reduce taxes on small businesses by $1.2 billion. He voted to adopt the biennial state budget, which passed in the House, 118-29. Ratliff co-sponsored the bill to prohibit texting while driving, which passed the House, 97-45. He voted to prohibit employers from asking for private passwords. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those individuals receiving unemployment compensation. Ratliff also added language to a proposed constitutional amendment to fund highway construction in Texas prohibiting new revenue from being used to build or finance toll roads, the voters approved the amendment with 80% in favor. He supported the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He also voted for companion legislation to enhance the medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers. For his solid pro-life voting record he received a 100% rating from Texas Right to Life and earned the support of Texas Alliance for Life and Texans for Life in his re-election bid. Ratliff supported the measure to forbid the state from engaging in the enforcement of federal regulations of firearms. He co-sponsored legislation to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in the name of campus security. He voted to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit and received an A Rating from the NRA and TSRA for his defense of Second Amendment Rights. He backed the redistricting bills for the state House and Senate and the United States House of Representatives and led efforts alongside Attorney General Greg Abbott to preserve Republican seats in Dallas County. To guarantee integrity of voting procedure, Ratliff voted for the legislation to prevent one individual from turning in multiple ballots; the measure passed the House, 93-48.

Early life and marriage  Huda Sha'arawi was born Nour Al-Huda Mohamed Sultan Shaarawi () in the Upper Egyptian city of Minya to the famous Egyptian Shaarawi family. She was the daughter of Muhamed Sultan Pasha Shaarawi, who later became president of Egypt's Chamber of Deputies. Her mother, Iqbal Hanim, was of Circassian descent and was sent from the Caucasus region to live with her uncle in Egypt. Sha'arawi was educated at an early age along with her brothers, studying various subjects such as grammar and calligraphy in multi-languages. She spent her childhood and early adulthood secluded in an upper-class Egyptian community.Shaarawi, Huda Post Colonial Studies. Retrieved 6 October 2014. After her father's death, she was under the guardianship of her eldest cousin, Ali Shaarawi. At the age of thirteen, she was married to her cousin Ali Pasha Sha'arawi, who Pasha Sultan named as the legal guardian of his children and trustee of his estate.Shaarawi, Huda. Harem Years: The Memoirs of an Egyptian Feminist. Translated and introduced by Margot Badran. New York: The Feminist Press, 1987.

Harem years: the memoirs of an Egyptian feminist (1879‚Äì1924). New York: Feminist Press at the City University of New York, 1987. She was taught to read the Quran and received tutoring in Quranic Arabic and Islamic subjects by female teachers in Cairo. Sha'arawi wrote poetry in both Arabic and French. Sha'arawi later recounted her early life in her memoir, MudhakkirƒÅtƒ´ (\\"My Memoir\\") which was translated and abridged into the English version Harem Years: The Memoirs of an Egyptian Feminist, 1879‚Äì1924.Huda Shaarawi, Harem Years: The Memoirs of an Egyptian Feminist (1879‚Äì1924), ed. and trans. by Margot Badran (London: Virago, 1986).  Nationalism  The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 was a women-led protest advocating for Egyptian independence from Britain and the release of male nationalist leaders. Members of the female Egyptian elite, such as Sha'arawi, led the masses of protestors while lower-class women and women from the countryside provided assistance to and participated in street protests alongside male activists. Sha'arawi worked with her husband during the revolution while he stood as acting vice president for the Wafd; Pasha Sha'arawi kept her informed so she could take his place if he or other members of Wafd were arrested. The Wafdist Women's Central Committee (WWCC), associated with Wafd, was founded on January 12, 1920, following the protests in 1919. Many of the women who participated in the protests became members of the committee, electing Sha'arawi as its first president. In 1938, Sha'arawi and the EFU sponsored the Eastern Women's Conference for the Defense of Palestine in Cairo, prioritizing nationalist issues over feminist concerns. In 1945 she received the Order of the Virtues (Egypt).Harem Year's Feminism Huda Sha'rawi At the time, women in Egypt were confined to the house or harem which she viewed as a very backward system. Sha'arawi resented such restrictions on women's movements, and consequently started organizing lectures for women on topics of interest to them. This brought many women out of their homes and into public places for the first time, and Sha'arawi was able to convince them to help her establish a women's welfare society to raise money for the poor women of Egypt. In 1910, Sha'arawi opened a school for girls where she focused on teaching academic subjects rather than practical skills such as midwifery. Sha'arawi made a decision to stop wearing her veil in public after her husband's death in 1922. After returning from the International Woman Suffrage Alliance Congress in Rome, she removed her veil and trampled it by her feet in public for the first time, a signal event in the history of Egyptian feminism. Women who came to greet her were shocked at first then broke into applause and some of them removed their veils. Within a decade of Huda‚Äôs act of defiance, few women still chose to wear the veil. Her decision to unveil was part of a greater movement of women, and was influenced by French born Egyptian feminist named Eug√©nie Le Brun, but it contrasted with some feminist thinkers like Malak Hifni Nasif. In 1923, Sha\`arawi founded and became the first president of the Egyptian Feminist Union. Characteristic of liberal feminism in the early twentieth century, the EFU sought to reform laws restricting personal freedoms, such as marriage, divorce, and child custody. Even as a young woman, she showed her independence by entering a department store in Alexandria to buy her own clothes instead of having them brought to her home. She helped to organize Mubarrat Muhammad Ali, a women's social service organization, in 1909 and the Intellectual Association of Egyptian Women in 1914, the year in which she traveled to Europe for the first time. She helped lead the first women's street demonstration during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, and was elected president of the Wafdist Women's Central Committee. She began to hold regular meetings for women at her home, and from this, the Egyptian Feminist Union was born. She launched a fortnightly journal, L'√âgyptienne in 1925, in order to publicise the cause.Zeidan, Joseph T. (1995). Arab Women Novelists: The Formative Years and Beyond. SUNY series in Middle Eastern Studies. Albany: State University of New York Press. , p. 34. She led Egyptian women pickets at the opening of Parliament in January 1924 and submitted a list of nationalist and feminist demands, which were ignored by the Wafdist government, whereupon she resigned from the Wafdist Women's Central Committee. She continued to lead the Egyptian Feminist Union until her death, publishing the feminist magazine l'Egyptienne (and el- Masreyya), and representing Egypt at women's congresses in Graz, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Marseilles, Istanbul, Brussels, Budapest, Copenhagen, Interlaken, and Geneva. She advocated peace and disarmament. Even if only some of her demands were met during her lifetime, she laid the groundwork for later gains by Egyptian women and remains the symbolic standard-bearer for their liberation movement. Sha'arawi received a major English-language biography by Sania Sharawi Lanfranchi in 2012.Casting off the Veil: The Life of Huda Shaarawi, Egypt's First Feminist (London: I.B. Tauris, 2012). Her meeting with Atat√ºrk The Twelfth International Women Conference was held in Istanbul, Turkey on April 18, 1935, and Huda Sha'arawi was the president and member of twelve women. The conference elected Huda as the vice-president of the International Women‚Äôs Union and considered Atat√ºrk as a role model for her and his actions. She wrote in her memoirs: \\"After the Istanbul conference ended, we received an invitation to attend the celebration held by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the liberator of modern Turkey ... In the salon next to his office, the invited delegates stood in the form of a semicircle, and after a few moments the door opened and entered Atat√ºrk surrounded by an aura of majesty and greatness, and a feeling of prestige prevailed. Honorable, when my turn came, I spoke directly to him without translation, and the scene was unique for an oriental Muslim woman standing for the International Women‚Äôs Authority and giving a speech in the Turkish language expressing admiration and thanks to the Egyptian women for the liberation movement that he led in Turkey, and I said: This is the ideal of leaving Oh the elder sister of the Islamic countries, he encouraged all the countries of the East to try to liberate and demand the rights of women, and I said: If the Turks considered you the worthiness of their father and they called you Atat√ºrk, I say that this is not enough, but you are for us ‚ÄúAtasharq‚Äù [Father of the East]. Its meaning did not come from any female head of delegation, and thanked me very much for the great influence, and then I begged him to present us with a picture of his Excellency for publication in the journal L'√âgyptienne.\\"Huda Shaarawi's Diaries ‚Äì Book of Al-Hilal, September / 1981 Philanthropy Sha'arawi was involved in philanthropic projects throughout her life. In 1909, she created the first philanthropic society run by Egyptian women (Mabarrat Muhammad 'Ali), offering social services for poor women and children.Margot Badran, Feminists, Islam, and Nation: Gender and the Making of Modern Egypt. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995), 50. She argued that women- run social service projects were important for two reasons. First, by engaging in such projects, women would widen their horizons, acquire practical knowledge and direct their focus outward. Second, such projects would challenge the view that all women are creatures of pleasure and beings in need of protection. To Sha'arawi, problems of the poor were to be resolved through charitable activities of the rich, particularly through donations to education programs. Holding a somewhat romanticized view of poor women's lives, she viewed them as passive recipients of social services, not to be consulted about priorities or goals. The rich, in turn, were the \\"guardians and protectors of the nation.\\" Tribute On 23 June 2020, Google celebrated her 141st birthday with a Google Doodle.

Background In the 14th century, Islamic influence from the Mali empire had crept into Hausa land. In 1349, the King of Kano Ali Yaji dissolved the cult of Tsumbubura, the powerful theocratic cult of the Hausa Animist religion, this sparked a wave of rebellion throughout the kingdom. At some point afterwards, the remnant of the high priests of the cult converged on Santolo, an important seat of Hausa Animism.

Biography  Ajami was born to a Greek Orthodox Christian family in 1888 and raised in Damascus, modern-day Syria. She spent her formative years in Damascus, where she received an education from Irish and Russian missionary schools, before studying nursing and graduating from the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut in 1906. Even while she was a student at the Syrian Protestant College, she began teaching as a visiting teacher in Zahl√©, Lebanon. After graduation, she began teaching in Port Said, Egypt. The following year she moved to a school in Alexandria, Egypt before returning to her native Damascus to teach English to students attending the Russian military school there. = Journalist = She was a writer frequently publishing her work under the pseudonym of Layla (her mother's name) for fear of reprisals. Ajami began freelance writing about social and political topics for Muhammad Kurd Ali's weekly newspaper al- Muqtabas, and in 1910 began her own periodical al-'Arus (the Bride), which was the first Syrian publication to defend women's rights, which ran for 11 years. As the editor-in-chief, she was able to employ a few educated girls to serve on its editorial board, although she had the young women sign their journalist contributions under an assumed name for their protection from harassment in Syria's male-dominated society. Ajami's first editorial in the new periodical was a declaration, \\"a manifesto for Syria's emerging feminist movement, dedicating her work... > \\"To those who believe that in the spirit of women in the strength to kill > the germs of corruption, and that in her hand is the weapon to rend the > gloom of opposition, and in her mouth the solace to lighten human misery.\\" She personally raised the necessary funds to support the journal, which soon became recognized as \\"one of the highest quality periodicals in the Arab world.\\" While the journal was a rousing success among the country's female educated elite, it was scorned by conservative Muslim readers who condemned its messages and sought to abolish it. During World War I, the journal suspended its publication and Ajami wrote editorials for the Egyptian newspaper al-Ahrar (Free Patriots), and al-Islah (Reform), an Arabic newspaper based in Buenos Aries, Argentina. She was fiercely opposed to the Ottoman Empire, especially after 1915 when authorities in Beirut, executed Ajami's fianc√©, Petro Pauli, for criticizing the occupying military regime of Sultan Mohammed Rashad V. In 1919, she officially restarted publication of al-Arus, but not without controversy. In 1920, religious leaders demanded that Ajami be brought to trial for promoting heresy by publishing a story supporting civil marriage. = Suffrage campaigner = In 1920, after the Ottoman Empire collapsed, she founded of the Damascus Women's Literary Club and spearheaded the movement to give women the right to vote, going directly to King Faysal I, the first post-Ottoman Syrian ruler. In that same year, she established a weekly salon in her home that was well attended by both men and women who took that opportunity to discuss politics, philosophy and religious affairs. Her salon was groundbreaking at the time, because allowing men and women to engage in discussions together was unheard of in Syria. In her own words, she described the salon's aim as \\"reviving female intelligentsia.\\" Ajami's successful career was tempered by elements of tragedy in her personal life. For many years, she longed to continue her studies abroad, but her father's death and the outbreak of war prevented her from doing so. Joseph T. Zeidan reminds us that her achievements \\"must be assessed in the light of formidable obstacles she encountered while struggling to keep her journal alive, not least of which were her father's attempts to persuade her to quit.\\",pp.46-49 = Later years = Ajami was somewhat of an anomaly for her time, and like her more famous peer May Ziadeh, Ajami never married. She died on December 25, 1965. = Tributes = Fares al-Khoury, the two-time prime minister of Syria, compared Ajami to her famous contemporary May Ziadeh (1886-1941) when he said in verse form, > My friends take it from me, I can say that Mary Ajami can match with May > Ziadeh For skill and ingenuity.

The Town lattice truss bridge was built in 1859-60, replacing an earlier span at the same location, and is one of New Hampshire's few surviving 19th-century covered bridges. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and included in the Waterloo Historic District in 2003. Description and history The Waterloo Covered Bridge is located in western Warner, spanning the Warner River in a roughly northeast-southwest orientation. The bridge is a single span with a span length of and an overall length of . It rests on concrete foundations that were laid in 1970, during a major rehabilitation of the structure. The roadway is wide (enough for a single lane of traffic), with a vertical clearance of . The bridge is sheathed by vertical planking and topped by a corrugated metal gable roof. The planking does not quite reach the eave, leaving an open band just below the roof line, and each side has several square openings cut in it for additional lighting. Newmarket Road was laid out by the town of Warner in 1839, suggesting a bridge was either built or already standing at this site at that time. The present bridge was likely built in 1860, when the town paid $473.65 for construction of the \\"Waterloo Bridge\\". The low price suggests that the abutments were probably repaired rather than rebuilt. The site of the bridge at the Waterloo Falls was adjacent to a number of industrial enterprises using the water power of the river and would have been an important feature of the village; all of these businesses failed and there are now only foundational remains.

History The DNP was established in 1959 by Herbert Ganado as a breakaway from the Nationalist Party.Vincent E McHale (1983) Political parties of Europe, Greenwood Press, p631 Its opposition to the Labour Party helped it win four seats in the 1962 elections. However, it lost its parliamentary representation in the 1966 elections and was subsequently disbanded. Ideology The party was more progressive than the Nationalist Party, and sought a return to responsible government, which had been revoked in 1959. Whilst the NP refused to co-operate with the British authorities, the DNP supported co-operation in order to achieve economic development that would ultimately lead to independence as a dominion.McHale, p632 The party also had a manifesto committing to social welfare.

It was the first of Ramsay's restaurants to be opened without the involvement of Chris Hutchinson, and at one point was backed by footballer David Beckham. The Caf√© serves Mediterranean cuisine, with mostly Italian dishes. The head chef, Davide Degiovanni, designs the menu, which is changed daily. Before the Caf√© was opened, it received more than 10,000 booking requests, with seating filled to the end of the year. Food critics' reviews have been mixed, with differing opinions of the veal saltimbocca but agreement in dislike of a dish of octopus, borlotti bean, and 'nduja sausage. History At one point, footballer David Beckham had invested in the restaurant. The Union Street Caf√© was the first restaurant opened by Gordon Ramsay Holdings without the involvement of Gordon Ramsay's father-in-law, Chris Hutchinson. Initially English footballer David Beckham was an investor in the restaurant, but he withdrew his support prior to launch. The interior of the restaurant is decorated in an industrial style designed by Russell Sage, who had previously created the interior of Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen. It has revealed concrete columns, ventilation shafts and without tablecloths on the tables. The location was formerly a loading bay, and the interior design incorporated several original elements into the dining space. The restaurant is located on the ground floor of Harling House and contains space for 99 covers. Following the launch of the restaurant's website, it received over 10,000 requests before opening. At launch, it was said to be fully booked until the end of the year. The launch party was held on 16 October 2013. Menu Due to the restaurant's location, prior to opening it was said that they would use fresh produce from suppliers in nearby Borough Market. These include items such as mussels from Wales and clams from Cornwall. The menu is described by the restaurant as \\"Mediterranean\\", but was said to be predominantly Italian by reviewers. The menu itself is changed on a daily basis, and designed by head chef Davide Degiovanni. He and Ramsay developed the initial range of dishes together. Reception Food critic Matthew Norman attended the restaurant on the day after opening. He said in his review for The Daily Telegraph, that the veal saltimbocca was too salty, and found other courses \\"blisteringly average\\" or \\"forgettably adequate\\". Norman also did not see the point of the Parmesan skin appetisers, saying that they were \\"bemusing\\". He gave the restaurant two out of five stars. John Walsh, for The Independent, found the linguine vongole to have \\"most buttery pasta [he had] ever eaten\\", and said that the saltimbocca was \\"astonishing\\" and that \\"the chef deserves a medal for keeping this dish simple, dramatic and irresistible.\\" He gave Union Street Caf√© four out of five for both food and service, and three out of five for ambience. In the review in Time Out, the portion sizes were said to be \\"considered meagre in the boot of Italy\\" but certain dishes such as the Parmesan skin appetisers and the chocolate and peanut butter cake were singled out for praise. Marina O'Loughlin wrote in The Guardian said that the mushroom risotto was excellent, as was the homemade gelato. Her only criticism was towards a dish of octopus, borlotti bean and 'nduja. However, she found that her enjoyment of the restaurant was troubled by the sheer expectation of a new Gordon Ramsay restaurant and the media campaign that preceded the opening. She gave it seven out of ten for food, atmosphere and value for money. David Sexton in London's The Evening Standard, described the crudo of stone bass as \\"excellent\\" and found that the tagliolini with rabbit was the best thing on the menu. He also disliked the octopus dish, saying that the 'nduja overpowered the rest of the ingredients. Sexton felt that the cafe was a fully fledged restaurant and gave it three out of five stars.

He was not selected in the 2014 NBA draft prior to his international career. Eversley generally plays the small forward position on the court. He played with the Cal Poly Mustangs men's basketball team throughout his college years and became the first athlete from Walter Payton College Prep to sign a National Letter of Intent with a men's basketball program in the NCAA Division I. Eversley previously played basketball at the collegiate level with the Rice Owls, but transferred after completing his freshman season. Some of his most prestigious honors through his years with Cal Poly include being named to the All-Big West First Team as a junior, and All-Big West Second Team in his final season. He was also a great contributor in the Mustangs' unanticipated run in the Big West championship, and was named the tournament's most valuable player after scoring eighteen points in the final game against Cal State Northridge. Eversley was considered to be the catalyst behind their 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament appearance.  Collegiate career  On, March 15, 2014, Cal Poly won its first ever Big West championship over CSU Northridge 61-59. Eversley was named the game's MVP with 18 points. By the end of his college years at Cal Poly, Eversley stood 12th on the program's all- time scoring list with 1,192 points total. He also ranked ninth under the rebounding category.  Professional career  Following Cal Poly's tournament defeat to Wichita State, Eversley took part in a nine-game, two-week tour through China with the United States Basketball Academy. Eversley signed with the Westports Malaysia Dragons of the ASEAN Basketball League (ABL) shortly after being undrafted through the 2014 NBA draft. The decision made him only the ninth Mustang to compete with a professional team after being coached by Joe Callero. He made his professional debut on July 16, 2014, against HiTech Bangkok City, scoring 31 points total. His first game helped him become the league's top scorer for the time period.

It was completed in 1950, before he finished his musical studies.  Composition  Ligeti finished this composition in 1950, when he was living in Hungary. At that time, he was following B√©la Bart√≥k's steps: he produced other vocal compositions based on Hungarian traditional music and poems. This composition has been later associated with Bujdos√≥ (1946) and K√°llai kett≈ës (1950), forming a set called Three Hungarian Folksongs, even though there is no direct relation; all those compositions were composed, conceived, and published separately. Lakodalmas was composed during a Stalinist era, and Hungarian folksongs were strictly restricted. It was later published by Schott Music.  Analysis  This short composition is in only one movement and takes approximately one minute to perform. It is amongst Ligeti's shortest vocal compositions. It is scored for an unaccompanied mixed SATB choir. The lyrics are in Hungarian and have never been adapted to any other language. However, they have been translated into English by Laurie Anne McGowan and German by Gyula Hellenbart. The lyrics are as follows: Menyasszony, v≈ëleg√©ny, de sz√©p mind a kett≈ë Olyan mind a kett≈ë, mint az aranyvessz≈ë hej, mint az aranyvessz≈ë. Jeges a sud√°rfa, neh√©z vizet merni √ñsmeretlen kisl√°nyt neh√©z meg√∂lelni hej, neh√©z meg√∂lelni.

The song has a steady tempo of ‚ô© = 140 and is marked Poco meno mosso towards the end of the composition, where the eighth notes used along the composition are turned into half notes and the song turns much more static.

The company Ateliers du Rond Point of Saint-√âtienne began producing automobiles in 1924. The cars carried the name Monotrace. In 1926 production was taken over by √âtablissements Monotrace S.A. at Courbevoie. That same year Joseph-August Roten, whose background was in engineering, took over the leadership of the business. Production ended in 1930. The cars The company's only model was based on the \\"Mauser Einspurauto\\" of 1923. It used two principal wheels, one behind the other, but with a second set of side-wheels which prevented the vehicle from falling over when stationary, but which folded up when the vehicle was traveling. The water cooled single cylinder motor had a capacity of 510cc and delivered an approximate maximum 12HP of power, delivered via a three speed transmission, using a chain drive, to the back wheel. There was space for two, positioned one behind the other. The manufacturer took a stand at the 20th Paris Motor Show in October 1925. At this time the price quoted for the vehicle was 8,900 francs. The range was broadened in 1926 with the introduction of a \\"delivery van\\" version of the Monotrace, and in 1929 a single seater sports model was added.

The park's major features include a large man-made pond, and there are active recreational facilities, including basketball and handball courts, and a baseball diamond. The traditional main gate is located at the junction of Washington and Centre streets, with a wall section that includes a built-in structure originally used as a covered shelter for a streetcar stop. The pond is transformed into an outdoor skating rink in winter. The park is also home to the city's largest playground, called the Monkey Around Playground. The park was established by a donation from Armenia White, a local philanthropist, and designed by Charles Eliot. Most of its basic landscaping, including the construction of two ponds, was completed in the 1890s. A number of the plantings lining the park's Washington Street boundary date to the initial period of development, and include several specimen trees and shrubs. The park's recreational facilities were expanded in the 1930s with funding from the Works Progress Administration, at which time the smaller of the two ponds was filled in, and replaced by a swimming pool.

It is located in the municipality of M√©rida, Spain, in Badajoz, in the Cordobilla de L√°cara, within the Sierra de San Pedro. The municipalities of La Roca de la Sierra and Puebla de Obando are nearby. San Isidro de Loriana was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural on 12 November 2013 in the category of monument. It is an example of Franciscan architecture. History =Initial structure= The Monastery of San Isidro de Loriana was erected in 1551 next to the Loriana river under direction of Fray Alonso del Manzanete, a native of the town of Manzanete (now Puebla de Obando). It is located in close proximity to the Sierra de San Pedro, in the Loriana meadow, in what is now the Vidrio estate. The meadow began to be populated in the sixteenth century and was jurisdictionally attached to La Nava de Santiago. The location takes the name of the nearby stream that waters the area, the Lourianilla or Lorianilla, a tributary of the Alcazaba river. The late eighteenth century Census of Floridablanca places it in M√©rida. The property on which the monastery was built belonged to Juan Vel√°zquez D√°vila, who offered to bear the cost of building and maintaining the convent, provided that the building was located on his property. The structure was built on an ancient chapel dedicated to Saint Isidore, believed to have formerly belonged to the Templars. The construction featured a narrow building with a single nave, separated into three sections, which had no more than two small rooms and no cloister. The upper section was divided into seven cells, which included the refectory, a kitchen, an office and the vestry. Fray Alonso remained Guardian of the Convent for seven years. He was later sent to Rocamadour, Salvatierra de Santiago and Alconchel, where he died in 1569. The Definitorios Provinciales (an entity that makes religious decisions) of 1557 and 1559 were held in the San Isidro de Loriana monastery. In one of those sessions Franciscan friar, San Pedro de Alc√°ntara, was elected Provincial Commissioner. =Refurbishment= Its location in close proximity to the river resulted in exposure to high humidity and eventual deterioration. The structure was refurbished in 1605 and relocated to safer and higher ground. New construction techniques were employed, that reflected its geographical proximity to the Portuguese border. Indigenous slate material was used in its construction, and involved masonry, brick and ashlar stones. It maintained the simplicity and frugality characteristic of the Franciscan order. The newly constructed monastery had a small 5x5 meter central cloister with eight Tuscan order granite columns supporting eight arches. This formed the lower gallery of the courtyard. The upper gallery was composed of an equal number of arcs. A granite well made of square curbstone was built indoors in the center of the courtyard. There is also an upper floor where the bedrooms of the Franciscans were located. The interior features a dining area, a barrel vault made of brick, an interior courtyard, a choir in the church and more bedrooms. Towards the southeast there are a series of swinging buttress double doors that lead into the aisle. The church is small and is attached to the cloister. There are other rooms around the cloister including the refectory, choir, sacristy, library, corridors and twelve cells. Abandonment The Loriana meadow was first populated in the thirteenth century by the Order of Santiago and later by small hamlets that emerged alongside the convent in the sixteenth century. The monastery of Loriana had a significant impact on the history of L√°cara and was a fundamental part of the town of Loriana. Documentary sources from Puebla de Obando, Lob√≥n, Roca de la Sierra, La Nava de Santiago, Torremayor, Montijo and Puebla de la Calzada point to the presence of the Loriana Franciscans at festivities and other important religious celebrations. The importance of the monastery declined overtime due in part to damages suffered during the Portuguese Restoration War and the War of the Spanish Succession that, between 1640 and the early 1700s, affected border areas of Baja Extremadura, including communities in Alburquerque and Badajoz. According to tradition, the monastery was a place of refuge for nearby towns. By the mid-eighteenth century the area was unpopulated, as indicated in the Catastro of Ensenada, although the Franciscan monastery was still functional, occupied by a community of eighteen monks and three lay minors. In the nineteenth century the monastery was damaged during the Spanish War of Independence. A few years later, Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal laws resulted in the final abandonment of the monastery by the friars in 1841. After the departure of the Franciscans the building passed into private hands and several farmhouses were built nearby. Now located on private property with restricted access, the monastery is completely abandoned and was formerly used as a warehouse or for keeping livestock. The structure is in an advanced state of ruin, and threatening to collapse. As a result of its poor condition it was included on the Red List of Endangered Spanish Heritage Sites (Lista roja de patrimonio en peligro), a list compiled and maintained by the Hispania Nostra foundation.

Retrieved on March 17, 2014. History On April 11, 2012 the HISD board voted to establish the school. The HISD board approved the conversion of the Ryan Middle School building into a magnet school. Jyoti Malhan was selected as the founding principal of the school. (Archive) The goal was to have at least 100 6th grade students upon its opening. Malhan used her own cell phone to personally recruit students to BCM Ryan. The school received 450 applications even though it had not yet been established; the lottery admissions process selected 250 of them. \\\\- The source does not clarify which ranking is involved. 70 students from District IV, the feeder pattern for the former Ryan Middle School, applied to BCM Ryan for that school year. This included 22 from Whidby Elementary, including 19 from Blackshear Elementary, 14 from Lockhart Elementary, 9 from Codwell Elementary, 4 from Peck Elementary, and 1 from MacGregor Elementary. () For its first year the school admitted 250 students. 11% of the students accepted to the school for the 2013-2014 school year lived in the former Ryan Middle School attendance zone. 28 of the District IV were accepted, including 10 from Lockhart, 6 from Blackshear, 5 from Whidby, 3 from Codwell, 2 from Peck, and one each from MacGregor and Thompson. The school accepted 19 students who attended charter elementary schools or private elementary schools. Based on the data, Jeffrey L. Boney of the Houston Forward Times, a black newspaper, argued that residents of the surrounding Third Ward area were being shortchanged. Of the 250 original 6th graders, after the end of the first year 16 were expelled and sent back their zoned schools due to low academic performance. 69 of the original 250 had received academic probation during their first year. By 2015 the school covered grade 7 and the student body increased to 480. At that time it had a wait list of 900 students, and in 2015 almost 1,800 students applied to attend the school. Jennifer Radcliffe of the Houston Chronicle stated that the school, which had been ranked as the 6th best middle school in HISD, as \\"a rare success story among open-enrollment middle schools\\" in the school district. Beginning in 2018 the school also serves as a boundary option for students zoned to Blackshear, Lockhart, and MacGregor elementary schools.\\"AGENDA Board of Education Meeting May 10, 2018.\\" Houston Independent School District. Retrieved on October 12, 2018. F1 p. 86/135. The HISD board voted unanimously for this change. Admissions BCMA at Ryan uses a lottery, instead of academic performance, as the basis for admissions. This is due to the federal grant for magnet schools used by BCMA at Ryan requiring this kind of admissions process. Therefore, incoming 6th graders have varying levels of academic abilities. Students zoned to Lockhart, Blackshear, and MacGregor elementary schools may attend BCMA at Ryan without going through the lottery. Demographics In 2015 the school had 480 students; 45% were Hispanic and Latino, 30% were black, and Anglo Whites and Asians made up the remainder. The elementary schools sending the largest numbers of students to BCM Ryan, as of that year, were Lockhart in the Third Ward and Roberts in Southgate, and 95 other elementary schools had students moving on to BCM Ryan. School uniforms BCM Academy at Ryan requires its students to wear school uniforms. Students are required to wear navy or burgundy shirts with the BCMA logo embroidered with khaki pants, shorts or skirts. Shorts and skirts must be knee length. Students are allowed to wear spirit shirts or college shirts with jeans. Students must wear belts and shirts must be tucked in. Hoodies are not permitted. Student body As of the 2013-2014 school year, 47% of the students were Hispanic and Latino, 35% were Black, 9% were White, and 9% were Asian.

Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U.S. 251 (1931), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state statute limiting the commissions allowable by insurers against loss by fire to local agents will be deemed a valid exercise of the police power in the absence of facts showing it to be unreasonable. Facts & procedural history A New Jersey statute required rates for fire insurance to be reasonable. O'Gorman and Young, Inc., a domestic corporation licensed as an insurance broker, sued a licensed foreign fire insurance company to recover a balance alleged to be due for services performed as local agent. O'Gorman and Young had contracts with both the Hartford Fire Insurance Company and the Phoenix Assurance Company which agreed to pay the agent 25% of the premiums, both insurance companies paid only 20%. O'Gorman and Young alleged that the statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Contracts Clause of the United States and New Jersey constitutions. The trial court ruled in favor of the insurance companies, finding that a law is presumed to be reasonable until a contrary showing is made. The New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals affirmed in a per curiam opinion. Decision The United States Supreme Court affirmed a judgment in favor of the insurance companies in O'Gorman and Young's action to recover payment for services rendered as a local agent. Writing for a 5-4 majority, Justice Brandeis cited German Alliance Insurance Co. v. Lewis (1914) for the proposition that the insurance business is so far affected with a public interest that a state may regulate insurance rates.

He was convicted of murder and hanged in 1979. Early years Mahlangu was born in Pretoria on 10 July 1956, the second son of Martha Mahlangu. His father left in 1962 and as a result he was raised by his mother, a domestic worker. He attended Mamelodi High School up to Standard 8 (his tenth year of school), but his education was interrupted in 1976 by the riots of the Soweto uprising that resulted in school closures. Military training In 1976 Mahlangu fled to Mozambique and spent six month in a refugee camp near Xai Xai. From there he was taken to an African National Congress (ANC) training camp called \\"Engineering\\", in Angola. There and at Funda Camp he received training in sabotage, military combat, scouting and politics. He, George 'Lucky' Mahlangu and Mondy Motloung were then taken to Swaziland, where they were given large suitcases filled with pamphlets, rifles and hand grenades. On 11 June 1977 they crossed the border into South Africa and started making their way to Johannesburg. Arrest The three comrades-in-arms, each carrying a large suitcase, were climbing into a taxi in Diagonal Street in the centre of Johannesburg. An ordinary policeman became suspicious and grabbed one of the suitcases. An AK-47 assault rifle and a hand grenade fell out. All three of them fled, Lucky Mahlangu in one direction and the other two in the direction of Fordsburg. There, in Goch Street, the two sought refuge in the storage facilities of the retailer John Orr's. One of them opened fire on the employees of the company, killing two and wounding another two. Mahlangu and Motaung were eventually arrested. Trial and sentence Mahlangu's trial started in the Supreme Court on 7 November 1977. He was defended by two advocates, Messrs Ismail Mohamed, S.C. and Clifford Mailer. They faced two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and various counts under the Terrorism Act. In its judgment the court found that Mahlangu and Motaung had acted with a common purpose and that it consequently did not matter which of the two had done the shooting and killing. Mahlangu was convicted on all counts. In terms of the South African law, the court was obliged to sentence an accused to death for murder, unless the accused proved mitigating circumstances. The court found that Mahlangu had failed to do so, and consequently handed down the death sentence. The court refused Mahlangu leave to appeal. His lawyers then asked the Appeal Court for leave to appeal and it was again refused. Mahlangu was hanged on 6 April 1979. Before going to the gallows he reportedly said: \\"Tell my people that I love them and that they must continue the fight, my blood will nourish the tree that will bear the fruits of freedom, Aluta continua.\\" Truth and Reconciliation Commission The commission examined the cases of Solomon Mahlangu and Monty Motaung and found that both of them were responsible for the deaths of Rupert Kessner and Kenneth Wolfendale. It also found both Mahlangu and Motaung guilty of gross human rights violations. Lastly it found both the African National Congress and the commanding officer of Umkhonto we Sizwe guilty of gross human rights violations. Legacy Solomon Mahlangu is commemorated in the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom Square in his hometown of Mamelodi, Pretoria. The square is focused on a bronze statue of Mahlangu.http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/bldgframes.php?bldgid=10357 In the city of Durban, there was a major arterial road named 'Edwin Swales VC Drive', after a RAF bomber commander who died in 1945. Following proposals made by the eThekwini Municipality, the road was changed to honour Mahlangu. In 2016, the main administrative building at the University of the Witwatersrand, formerly known as Senate House, was renamed Solomon Mahlangu House.http://m.ewn.co.za/2016/04/07/Plans-underway-to-rename-Senate-House- after-Solomon-Mahlangu The 2017 film Kalushi chronicles his life and times.

Located on a 90-acre campus, it offers classes in art education, drawing and painting, ceramics and stained glass, knitting and quilting, and hosts concerts and community events. Among its facilities are the Mitchell Museum, the Kuenz Sculpture Park, the Shrode Art Center (art education), the Schweinfurth House, and the Performance Hall inside the Mitchell Museum. Mitchell Museum The Mitchell Museum - named for John R. and Eleanor R. Mitchell, who bequeathed their art collection to Cedarhurst in 1973 - contains a collection of American paintings including works by Mary Cassatt, Thomas Eakins, William Glackens, Robert Henri, George Luks, John Sloan, and other early-20th-century masters. History A significant personal art collection was the reason John and Eleanor Mitchell planned a museum in rural southern Illinois. The museum was built to house the couple's collection of late 19th and early 20th century American paintings and artifacts. The collection included works from their friend and fellow collector John Parish, of Centralia, Illinois. The Mitchells acquired their artwork over four decades. In 1965, they established the Mitchell Foundation to build the Mitchell Museum at Cedarhurst and the Mitchell Museum opened in 1973. Both John and Eleanor died before the museum was completed. Today In the past 40 years, Cedarhurst has grown into a cultural mecca spread over 90 acres. The original two-room museum has expanded into a 33,000-square-foot cultural center with four galleries (one of which exhibits works from the Mitchell collection), an interactive family learning center, and a performance hall. The campus is also home to the Shrode Art Center, which includes a gallery, classrooms, and studio space; the historic Mitchell Home and Schweinfurth House, used for special events and meetings; and the Goldman- Kuenz Sculpture Park which features contemporary sculpture. =Mitchell Home= John and Eleanor Mitchell built their home in 1936. The house was designed by Eleanor's father for the couple's 80-acre Mt. Vernon estate called Cedarhurst. John had named the property after the Mitchell ancestral home in Corinth, Illinois, which his great-grandfather had previously used as a safe haven for slaves traveling north on the Underground Railroad. The Mitchells had guard dogs roaming the Cedarhurst grounds much like John's great grandfather, albeit for a different reason. In 1949 the Mitchells remodeled the home and added the east and west wings, including major expansion and renovations to the kitchen. They entertained often in the renovated space, which others described as sophisticated and stylish, yet also comfortable. Town and Country magazine featured the residence in a four-page article entitled \\"Contemporary with Antiques\\" in November 1954. The article showed two of their paintings, Mrs. T in Wine Silk by George Bellows and Captain Jack Kelly by Waldo Pierce. Today, the Mitchell House is maintained by the museum's operations staff and is used for meetings, special events, and facility rentals. It is not open to the public on a daily basis.

His style was best characterised as ‚Äòstructural abstraction‚Äô.  Early life and education  Born in Larnaca 21 November 1929, he demonstrated an aptitude for painting early on and staged exhibitions while still a high-school student at the Pancypriot Commercial School. Upon graduation, he travelled to post-war England in 1949 to pursue his dream of studying art. His studies took him to Saint Martin's School of Art, Sir John Cass College, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and the Slade School of Art. As his friend the late Stass Paraskos noted: \\"At the Slade, he was taught by William Coldstream, and in his early work Votsis was influenced by the Euston Road School, a group of leftwing realist artists including Coldstream\\". In his second year at the Slade, he won first prize in a university-wide drawing competition but declined the prize, explaining that he did not deem his work deserving. Those same exacting standards lead him to destroy almost all the paintings he produced during this period. After enduring financial hardship and even a bout of tuberculosis, he graduated from the Slade in 1955.  Career  He returned to Cyprus the same year and co- founded the Cyprus Chamber of Fine Arts. Together with a number of other pioneering artists he was instrumental in introducing modern art to Cyprus. He represented the island nation on the international stage in various exhibitions including: *The Venice Biennale *The Biennale of Alexandria *The Triennale of India *The S√£o Paulo Biennial *The Biennial of Graphic Arts in Buenos Aires-Argentina *The International Exhibition of New Artists in New York *The International Biennial of Graphic Arts in Fredrikstad Norway *The International Exhibition of Graphic Arts in Frechen Germany *The International Exhibition of Graphic Arts (Gallery Du Bois) in Pennsylvania *The Brussels Biennale His paintings can be found in a number of collections including the National Gallery of Greece, the Greek Ministry of Culture, the Vorres Museum, the Presidential Palace of Cyprus and other public and private collections in Cyprus, Greece and beyond. Notable among the work completed prior to his death is his collaboration with the artist Stass Paraskos. Working on a single canvas but maintaining their respective styles, these paintings are known as the ‚Äòpomishiarika‚Äô (Cypriot dialect for ‚Äòjointly owned‚Äô), although the art historian Michael Paraskos has described them as essentially anarchist paintings in which the 'dictatorship' of the single artist over the canvas is replaced by a democratic space.Michael Paraskos, 'The Anarchists', in Stelios Votsis and Stass Paraskos, The Anarchists [exhibition catalogue] (Nicosia: En Tiris, 2007) p.7 Some of these joint works were put on display in Nicosia 2007, in an exhibition inaugurated by the British art historian Norbert Lynton. Votsis was awarded the Ruskin prize in drawing and the bronze medal in the European prize for painting contest which was held in Ostend-Belgium in 1973. For his contributions to the culture of Cyprus he was awarded an Annual Honorary Grant by the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Cyprus.

The shopping center originally opened in August 1978 with Hart-Albin, Hennessy's, Nordstrom Place Two and Sears as anchor stores. Today, the mall is anchored by AMC Theatres and two Dillard's stores, with Scheels All Sports opening in 2021. An adjacent strip mall is anchored by Bed Bath & Beyond, Bob Ward's and Cost Plus World Market. Southgate Mall is recognized as the largest enclosed shopping area in the region of Western Montana. History =Development and opening= JCPenney store at Southgate Mall in 2017 The idea for an enclosed shopping mall in Missoula dates back to 1973, when Erickson Development Co., a Minnesota-based development firm, proposed a $15 million regional shopping center south of Buckhouse Bridge, along U.S. Highway 93. On February 9, 1977, developer George Lambros revealed plans to build a 398,000 square-foot shopping mall on 68 acres between U.S. Highway 93 and South Avenue in Missoula. The Missoula City Council approved Lambors' plans on February 14, with construction expected to begin April 1. On May 10, Hart-Albin, Hennessy's and Sears were confirmed as anchor stores. An additional anchor, a two-level Nordstrom Place Two store, was confirmed in March 1978. In July, after months of speculation, J. C. Penney was confirmed as the anchor for the mall's planned second phase. Southgate Mall's first tenant, Kings Table Restaurant, opened on June 28, 1978, with Sears following on July 12 and Hart-Albin on July 27. Southgate Mall held its grand opening ceremony on August 2. The mall's second phase, which added an additional 25 stores and anchor J. C. Penney, was completed between August and November 1979. In August 1983, Pay 'n Save and Ernst Home Centers were added to the mall in a detached building south of the existing structure. =Later years= Dillard's (formerly Hennessy's) at Southgate Mall in 2018 In February 1987, Pay 'n Save announced the closure of its Southgate Mall store. Another anchor store, Nordstrom Place Two, announced its closure in November 1988. In April 1989, Hart-Albin relocated to the former Nordstrom Place Two building. However, this new store was shut down just three months later. Hart-Albin's original space was replaced by Lamonts in August 1989. In April 1990, the vacant Pay 'n Save store was replaced with Fabricland. By mid-1996, a Bob Ward's sporting goods store was constructed adjacent to the Fabricland and Ernst complex. In October 1996, Lamonts announced plans to close as part of the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization effort. One month later, Ernst Home Centers announced plans to liquidate and close all 53 stores. Fabricland also exited the mall, in July 1998. Later in 1998, Hennessy's was rebranded as Dillard's, following the retailer's acquisition of Hennessy's parent company Mercantile Stores. By the end of the year, two Herberger's stores were added to the mall, replacing the vacant Lamonts and Hart-Albin spaces. Bed Bath & Beyond was added to the mall in 2007, replacing Fabricland. Cost Plus World Market was added to the mall in early 2014, replacing Ashley HomeStore. In March 2015, Sears announced the closure of its Southgate Mall store. Montana's first H&M; store opened at the mall in September 2015. Plans for a $64 million renovation and expansion the Southgate Mall were announced in 2015. In April 2016, AMC Theatres (then known as Carmike Cinemas) announced plans to build a 900-seat dine-in movie theater at the mall. The 45,000 square-foot theater will be built between the Mustard Seed restaurant and the former Sears property. In February 2017, Lucky's Market confirmed plans to open a grocery store in a 32,000 square-foot portion of the Sears building. Construction on the mall expansion was completed in 2018. In April 2018, Herberger's parent company The Bon-Ton announced it will liquidate and close all 267 stores. Plans for a second Dillard's store, replacing the Herberger's store in the center of the mall, were announced in February 2019. On January 17, 2020, it was announced that J. C. Penney would also be closing on April 24 as part of a plan to close 6 stores nationwide. Four days later, Lucky's Market announced it will close in February. On January 24, 2020, Scheels All Sports announced it will replace J. C. Penney in 2021.

She asked that Mass be said in her house until a church was built. The Jesuits also went to South Wimbledon for the Catholics there and said Mass in St Mary's School. In 1884, Edith Arendrup commissioned the construction of Sacred Heart Church in the area. It was finished in 1887 and designed by Frederick Walters.History from Winefride Church, retrieved 16 March 2014 By 1903, the number of Catholics were growing in South Wimbledon and it was decided to build another church in the parish to accommodate to increasing congregation. The same architect of Sacred Heart Church, Frederick Walters, was asked to design the church. Construction started in 1904 and finished in 1905. The Jesuit influence on the church is shown by there being a statue of Saint Ignatius close to a statue of the parish patron, Saint Winefride. In 1961, the Jesuits handed over administration of the church to the Archdiocese of Southwark who continue to serve the parish. In the 1980s the church was reordered with the altar being brought forward. Stained glass was added to some of the windows and a central heating system was installed at this time. The church has a hall on Bridges Road, this continues as parish hall and was renovated in 2004.

The air base covers 3000 hectares of land of which only a third is inside the operational area marked by a 17 km long fence.  History  German POWs paint British markings on a Messerschmitt Bf 110 night fighter following the liberation of Denmark in August 1945 The air base was constructed during the German Occupation in 1940 under the name \\"Einsatzhafen Grove\\" (later Flieger-Horst Grove) to facilitate offensive operations against England. Later in the war, it became a base for defensive fighter planes. Following the British advance into Denmark in May 1945, during which the airfield was surrendered to Captain Eric Brown RN, of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), a group of nine Ar 234B reconnaissance bombers were found at the base and subsequently transferred by Brown and his colleagues to Farnborough.http://www.airmen.dk/pdfs/amAirbaseKarup.pdf By December 1945 the air base was taken over by the Danish Civil Air Defence, which used it as a refugee camp for 22,000 German refugees. Control over the area was transferred to the Royal Danish Army in January 1946, continuing the use as refugee camp until 1949. In 1947 the Danish Army Air Corps established a flying school, maintenance centre and logistics office at Karup, preparing for Meteor, Oxford and Spitfire fighter planes. When the Royal Danish Air Force was established in 1950, the area was named Air Base Karup. During the post-war years, Karup Air Base became a central part of Denmark's NATO defence plan and played a major role in the establishment of the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF). In 1955 the Tactical Air Command was placed at Karup. Several American produced planes were stationed at the base in the 1950s and 1960s, among them T-33, F-84, RF-84F and F-100. In 1970 the Royal Danish Air Force purchased two squadrons of Swedish Draken strike fighters and stationed them at Karup.

As the Macedonian version of the kemenche it is very similar to the violin or viola. The kemane also resembles the Greek instrument lyre. The instrument is usually used to accompany folk music and singing, particularly epic poetry, and is rarely used as a solo instrument. The kemane can be made in various forms. The length varies between , their shape can be either straight or bent in a curved shape. Older kemane's were made by hacking holes in the instrument in which were inserted horse tail hairs, however the modern kemane's strings are attached to a wooden headstock, similar to that of a violin. It is prepared out of one piece of wood (walnut, maple, or other) with three structural parts: the body (krtuna), neck (shija), and the headstock (glava). The strings are set at different heights, so that it can be played on two strings simultaneously. The sound is produced by the movement of the bow from the one to the other blade, which grinding produces a sound of undetermined height. Although it is considered one of the oldest string instruments in the region of Macedonia, the kemane appeared in Macedonian music in the late 19th and early 20th century when it entered the Macedonian ƒçalgija compositions. The name of the kemane probably comes from kemen√ße, the Turkish word for fiddle. The kemane has three strings, although there are some made with four which are very rare.

She is best known for initiating the field of \\"Ayurgenomics\\" in partner with her colleague Dr Bhavana Prasher (MD Ayurveda) under the mentorship of Prof. Samir K. Brahmachari. Ayurgenomics is an innovative study, blending the principles of Ayurveda- the traditional Indian system of medicine- with genomics. Mukerji is also a major contributor in the Indian Genome Variation Consortium, a comprehensive database that is producing \\"the first genetic landscape of the Indian population\\", and has been an author in many publications that use IGV databases to study population genomics. Mukerji has done extensive research on hereditary ataxias, and is involved in many other projects related to tracking disease origins and mutational histories. She is recipient of the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2010 for her contribution in the field of Medical Sciences. Personal life Mukerji was born on 13 November 1967 in Madhya Pradesh to Bengali parents. She currently resides in New Delhi, India. She holds a doctoral degree (Ph.D) in bacterial molecular genetics from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. In an interview, Mukerji states one of her most influential mentors has been Dr. Samir Kumar Brahmachari, the former Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research known for his works in biophysics and pharmacogenetics. Career & Research After completing her doctoral degree, Mukerji joined the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi in 1997. She has since worked in the field of population genetics and evolutionary genomics and has also had a particular interest in personalized medicine and the integration of Western Medicine and Ayurvedic medical practices. One of her most notable works was deciphering the functions of Alu regions, the most abundant transposon found in primate populations. Her and her team concluded that these sequences code for RNA that serve as transcription factors, regulating a multitude of cell functions, including heat shock stress responses. Mukerji's publications on Alu sequences provide evidence of its involvement in homeostatic maintenance in humans, as well as the functions of miRNA as regulatory pathways specific to humans. Mukerji has since continued to work in trying to understand the mechanisms behind heat shock response systems and the functions of satellite non-coding RNA as a transcriptional repressor. She took an active role in establishing the Indian Genome Variation Consortium. Created in 2003, this database collects information on the genetic variations between the multiple subpopulations in India in an effort to improve personalized pharmaceuticals and understand genetic predisposition to disease. She established that genomic data could be adopted to decipher \\"signatures of natural selection and tracing mutational histories\\", and has used her studies to track migration patterns of many Asian populations and disease origins. Data from this initiative was used in a publication Mukerji was a contributor on, linking the genetic ancestry of the Siddi people from the Western region of India to Bantu-speaking East African tribes. Another study in which Mukerji used the IGV database is in studying keratinization genes, associated with waterproofing epidermal layers and being a contributor to different skin phenotypes for populations living in different climates. She wanted to see whether or not this gene responds to environmental stresses and how intensely or rapidly. Using an analysis of copy number variants and DNA and protein sequence differences amongst diverse Indian populations from varying climates, Mukerji makes conclusions about the changes within this area of skin-related genes and the role it plays in adaptations in response to environmental stimuli. In blue is the cerebellum; this portion of the brain becomes swollen or injured in cerebellar ataxias. Mukerji has also done significant work towards bettering clinical diagnostics processes of disorders in India. She worked particularly with a group of neurodegenerative diseases known as Cerebellar ataxias, a heritable condition in which the cerebellum portion of the brain becomes damaged. This condition is known to arise from a combination of many mutations, and so establishing a clear genetic correlation is difficult, making clinical screening difficult as well. Through tracing the disease ancestry and \\"mutational history\\", as well as a study of thousands of Indian families, Mukerji and her team were able to get a better understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms that cause ataxias and develop a clinical screening to be able to check disease susceptibility of healthy patients. This method is being used at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and helps reduce economical and medical stresses on families. Further studies done by Mukerji show more evidence of the mechanisms behind ataxias. Her work in studying spinocerebellar ataxia identifies a repeat expansion mutation as the cause of the disorder. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Indian and Mexican families show a shared expansion pattern in these two geographically distinct groups, making it possible to understand more about the ancestry of these particular mutations that cause this disease. In another study, Mukerji and her team analyzed another heritable neural disorder, dyslexia. They identified genes of a PCDHG cluster and pinpointed specific chromosomal locations of polymorphisms that contribute to the disorder. They also tracked the mutational history and lineages of these polymorphism, in both humans and other related primates. Their work helps better explain the mechanisms in play in dyslexia and the association of PCDHG genes with \\"neural adhesion proteins\\" that are related to cognitive functionality in primates. Mukerji also studied active pulmonary tuberculosis in North Indian populations. Through a study of cytokine serum levels between patients with active tuberculosis and healthy individuals, Mukerji was able to identify five cytokine gene polymorphisms correlating to immunity against tuberculosis. Along with her other projects tracking mutational history and disease evolution, Mukerji also did work studying correlations between polymorphisms in the APOBEC3B gene and malaria susceptibility. Many versions of this gene with various insertions and deletions are found in human populations. Mukerji's study found a clear correlation between an insertion in this gene and populations with endemic levels of falciparum malaria, the most severe form of malaria, or in the genomes of descendants from such areas. Accordingly, their study also shows a strong correlation between a deletion in this gene and weakened defense against falciparum malaria. This provides direct evidence through population genetics survey that suggests that variants of the APOBEC3B have some effect on susceptibility to this form of malaria. Mukerji actively initiated the field of \\"Ayurgenomics\\", integrating the phenotyping Ayurveda principles of Indian medical system with \\"objective parameters of modern medicine for identifying molecular endophenotypes.\\" She states that she wants her research to be able to \\"contemporize Ayurveda\\" by finding valid molecular backing for Ayurvedic practices and being able to use both to better preventative medical practice. Her research on SNPs and CNV diversity in the Indian population as a part of the Indian Genome Variation Consortium provided genetic evidence for Ayurvedic \\"Prakritis\\", or subgroups of healthy individuals based on phenotypic differences that govern an individual's lifestyle and medical profile. These \\"Prakriti's\\" are used for \\"assessing disease susceptibility and drug responsiveness\\", a concept that parallels ideas of personalized pharmaceuticals in Western Medicine. One molecular example Mukerji and her team studied has to go with the EGLN1 gene, associated with oxygen retention in bodily tissues and the condition of hypoxia. Differences in this key gene are associated with high-altitude adaptations in particular populations, and agree with the distinguishing of different Prakriti's, giving a molecular basis for the ancient medical practice. Mukerji has found other such biological markers that also support the Ayurvedic body types, such as levels of lipids. A unique finding of her studies in genomics is \\"that the ethnically and linguistically diverse Indian population was united by distinct DNA patterns\\". This has led to the inference that the genomics-based treatments of pharmacogenetics, also encompassing Ayurvedic practices, are possible. Mukerji continued her study with hypoxia in examining and trying to decipher its correlation with asthma and other pulmonary conditions. The study, conducted on mice, used a pharmacologically-induced hypoxic response to study how gene expression and induction factors are affected by the condition, and how this may lead to symptoms that cause the development of asthma. Mukerji and her team discovered that an exaggerated hypoxic response did indeed increase asthma in mice, even to fatal levels. This is clinically relevant as many pharmaceutical drugs function by tampering with these hypoxic response mechanisms, though the details of the mechanisms and its effects on the body are not well known. In January 2014, Mukerji gave a lecture at a TEDx event in New Delhi, India on the practice of personalized medicine through Ayurveda and its integration with modern medicine and genomics. Awards Mukerji has received several prestigious awards. On 24 September 2001, she was awarded the CSIR Young Scientist Award. She then was nominated to be a member of HUGO, the Human Genome Organization, in 2006. She received the National Young Woman Bioscientists Award in 2008 and the prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2010.

Purpose  There were several advantages to standardising the design and construction: # Retention of proven design features when building new bunkers # Simpler manufacture of large quantities e.g. of armoured and ventilation components and simplified ordering from the industrial manufacturers involved # Easier surveying of construction sites with regard to the tactical situation # Simplified construction process # Easier supply of materials to the construction site  Extent of standardization  As early as 1933 the Army command began work on the standardisation of defensive works with their publication of the Order for the Construction of Permanent Fortifications (Vorschrift zum Bau st√§ndiger Befestigungsanlagen) or B. st. B. In addition to general directions, it also contained very specific regulations on the armoured components (Panzerungsteilen or P-Teile) and ventilation components (L√ºftungsteilen or ML-Teile) to be used. The most important aspect of standardization was construction thickness (Ausbaust√§rke). This referred to the thickness of the walls and ceilings of the bunker. In the four years it took to build the Siegfried Line, changes were repeatedly made to the list of components to be used. The reasons for this were continual developments in weapon technology as well as the availability of armoured components and raw materials (steel) in general. Construction thicknesses (wall and ceiling thicknesses): *A = 3.5 metres *A1 = 2.5 metres *B new = 2.0 metres *B old = 1.5 metres *B 1 = 1.0 metres *C = 0.6 metres *D = 0.3 metres In addition, bunker design was arranged in \\"series\\", the 1939 designs with A and B thickness falling into the 100 series. Later 400, 500 and 600 series were created, the new series were more designed to enable the casemate to be capable of taking captured weapons than to be stronger, the 400 series was designed for Czechoslovakian weapons. The Channel Islands received mainly 600 series constructions. Whilst constructions were undertaken and planned by the OT for the Heer (army), the Kriegsmarine (navy) and Luftwaffe (airforce) would also man some of the fortifications, and they had their own designs and designations of fortifications, the Navy used M (Mittlere or Medium) for normal sea defence batteries with S (Schwere or Heavy) for the larger calibre guns, with FL (Flak or anti-aircraft) and V (Versorgung or support) for other emplacements, using thicknesses varying from 1.2m to 2.2m. The Luftwaffe simply added a letter L to all their designs, copying 1938 designs before creating their own series. The standardisation greatly simplified the manufacture of equipment, the supply of materials and the budgetary and financial control of the construction as well as the speed of planning for construction projects.  Development of Regelbau designs from 1936 to 1940  Following the occupation of German territories west of the Rhine, fortress engineers began the construction of the Siegfried Line in 1936. In doing so they were able to benefit from their earlier experience of bunker construction. In compliance with the Versailles Treaty, they had already built the Wetterau-Main-Tauber position and Neckar-Enz position before 1936. When, in 1936, construction started on the Siegfried Line itself, they were able at the outset to utilize designs from the two earlier fortifications. From these existing plans, fortress pioneers rapidly developed improved bunkers that were built from 1937. This building phase was named the Engineer Construction Programme and was characterized by bunkers built to B1 standard thicknesses (see above). Since the thickness of these structures was soon considered to be too weak and because there was a large number Regelbau designs (and hence confusion), new types were developed and implemented from 1938. These new designs were achieved largely by simplifying and reducing the number of Regelbau types. This new building phase was called the Limes Programme. The fortress engineers were no longer in charge of construction; instead Organization Todt (OT) took over, promising Hitler it would deliver the number of structures he wanted. Plans for the Limes Programme did not envisage the inclusion of the cities of Aachen and Saarbr√ºcken and they therefore ended up in front of the planned line of fortifications. That changed in 1939 with the Aachen-Saar Programme. From 1939, yet more new Regelbau bunkers were designed for the construction programme that saw increases in the construction thicknesses. From then on, only bunkers that met the in \\"B new\\" and \\"A\\" standards were to be built. With the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939, priorities for the construction of the Siegfried Line changed. The renewed shortage of raw materials led to the development of a new series of Regelbau designs, the so-called wartime standard designs or Kriegsregelbauten. After the \\"lavish\\" Regelbauten of the Aachen-Saar Programme, the final construction phase was dominated by massive financial constraints. For example, observation cupolas and flank firing positions were no longer provided and the rooms were smaller. Expansion of construction projects from 1941 to 1944 Casemate for French 10.5 cm K 331(f), Series 600, given the name \\"J√§ger\\" after the OT officer who designed it. In 1940 work was ordered on a number of construction projects in Western Europe. Amongst the first were the Dover Strait guns begun in July 1940 and included Todt Battery. Building began in February 1941 on the Saint-Nazaire submarine base Following the first effective commando raid in March 1941 Operation Claymore and with the planning of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler decided in June 1941 to strengthen the west against possible attacks. The Channel Islands were chosen to become major fortifications, followed in 1942 with the order to build the Atlantic Wall. A mass of equipment was needed, cement, sand, gravel and steel to construct the concrete fortifications, weapons and armour plate for defence and hundreds of thousands of workers. To offset shortages, equipment from French and other occupied armies were incorporated in the defences, casemates designed for non-German artillery, anti tank and machine guns and the use of turrets from obsolete tanks in tobrukstand pill boxes (tobruk pits). The labour came from an expansion of the Organisation Todt, who contracted with building construction companies from Germany and occupied countries to undertake the work. The OT provided them with equipment, supervisors and labour. Labour comprised skilled volunteers, engineers, designers and supervisors, who were paid and treated well, second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and metal workers, again these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. Next came unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly, lastly came effective slave labour, paid so little, badly fed and treated very harshly. New designs were added to the Regelbau system, some were variants on existing designs, modified to suit local conditions, others were created to encompass new weapons, such as improved radar units, V-weapons and weapons captured from occupied countries. Where army or naval engineers were responsible for a major construction, rather than the OT, the construction often did not follow the Regelbau system.

In 1923 he proposed a plan of extension of Bilbao to the mouth of Abra, a visionary project that would result in the current metropolitan area. Early life and education Bastida was born in one of the primary neighbourhoods of Bilbao on 15 October 1879. His father, Luis de Bastida y Azcuenaga, studied a naval officer degree, but he worked as a Mathematics teacher in San Antonio School in Bilbao. His mother, Josefa Bilbao Landazuri, obtained the qualification of Master of Primary Education in 1867 and she gave birth to six children. Thanks to his parents academic training, culture occupied an important role in the Bastida family. Ricardo, showed a great facility for drawing and excelled in Mathematics. He trusted his father to make many decisions, such as choice of profession. He completed his early studies in Achuri's Public Schools and Secondary School in \\"Plaza de las Auxiliares\\", where he met the famous painter Aurelio Arteta, with whom he developed a close friendship. Biography and career *1895-1901: In 1895, Ricardo received in the university district of Valladolid the high school title with a remarkable average of a grade of B in Arts and a grade of outstanding in Sciences. That same year he joined the School of Architecture of Barcelona. His love of photography started then. Snapshots were revealed by him in a small home lab. *1902-1904: During these years Ricardo ends, at the age of 22, his studies of architecture and he returns to Bilbao. Anxious and excited, he entered the studio of architect Severino de Achucarro, author, with Paul Alzola and Ernesto Hoffmeyer engineers, of the extension project of Bilbao 1876. In 1903 he incorporated into the municipality of the town as an assistant Achucarro. Bastida's collaboration with the Bilbao administration lasted 50 years. In 1904 the project of the enlargement of 1876 had limitations or lack of ambition that the same authors acknowledged during its execution. In order to find a better solution, the City Council held a public competition Bilbao expansion, which is presented jointly by Bastida and Pedro Guim√≥n. Later, Bastida joined the teaching staff of the School of Arts and Crafts in Bilbao. Alh√≥ndiga Bilbao. *1905-1906: Bastida was commissioned to raise various public facilities. Commissioned by the town hall, he travelled in 1905 to develop comparative studies to different European cities: Hamburg, Bremen, Paris, Brussels, Antwerp ... When he returned, he projected the \\"Alh√≥ndiga Municipal de Bilbao\\", \\"Lavaderos de la alameda de San Mam√©s\\" and \\"Calle Casta√±os\\". In those three buildings and in the disappeared cinema Olimpia made the nearest approach to modernism of his career. Despite the high costs involved of traveling in those years, Bastida went, throughout his life and on behalf of the town hall, to various centers in Europe and America. Thus he acquired an excellent cultural preparation that was completed with visits to museums, factories, hospitals, etc. *1907: Bastida was named Architect Head of Civil Construction of the City of Bilbao, a position he held until 1927. In this time interval he could devise some of the most relevant projects, many of which were not carried out because it had not obtained the final approval of the administrative bodies. He designed the \\"Parque del Ensanche\\" with the engineer Juan Eguiraun. *1908-1910: Bastida was still living with his parents and siblings. Later, Jos√© Uribe y Zarraonaindia asks for plans for a detached house in Ondarroa,a village of Biscay. Years later, the house passed to the architect, who used it as a summer residence. In 1909 the \\"Alhondiga Municipal de Bilbao\\" opened. The expansion of the city brought to its inhabitants cosmopolitan concerns, so the idea of holding an International Exhibition in Bilbao arises. *1911: Bastida took over the post of deputy director of the School of Arts and Crafts and Foremen. There he gave a series of lectures about the history of art. During the summer of 1911, his partner and friend Pedro Guim√≥n encouraged Bastida to visit him at Ondarroa, where he spent the holidays. There, he was introduced to Rosario Lecea, which then became his wife. She was the daughter of a sea captain, she was born in Manila, the Philippine's capital. She lived in Ondarroa with her mother until his father's death in Singapore. *1912-1915: For professional reasons he went back to Europe to visit the School of Arts and Crafts in Geneva, Florence, Milan and Naples. He also undertook a study for the \\"Parque del Ensanche\\". On January 8, 1913, Ricardo Bastida and Rosario Lecea married. The religious ceremony was held in the parish of St. Mary of Ondarroa. Then, they went on their honeymoon to Paris, Zurich, Rome, Florence and other Italian cities. When they returned, they settled in the house of the architect of the street Ercilla. The couple had eight children: Ricardo, Juan Luis, Rosario, Jose Mar√≠a, Mar√≠a Victoria, Eloisa, Carmen and Teresa.In 1914, commissioned by the \\"Caja de Ahorros de Bilbao\\" Bastida ends the project \\"Casa Cuna de San Antonio\\", in Urazurrutia.After a year, in 1915, with population overflow, Bilbao could not cope with the defective schools. To alleviate the excess of admissions applications, Bastida projected, by order of the town hall, schools in Indautxu. *1916-1920: In 1916, Indalecio Prieto Tuero was elected councillor of the town hall in Bilbao . Despite ideological differences between Bastida and Prieto, they formed a deep friendship. They admired and respected each other, and they were united by a desire to improve the life of the society in which they lived. Later, in 1919, Bastida designed the branch of \\"Banco de Bilbao\\" in \\"Calle Alcal√°\\". *1921-1922: Three walls of the detached house of Ondarroa were available for Aurelio Arteta to paint them. Arteta reflected scenes of Basque villages' religious festivities in blues and greens, which continued at that place until they were transferred to another support. Years later, in 1963, the children of the architect donated them to the \\"Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao\\". The house was demolished soon after. Regarding his hobbies in those years, in addition to cinema and photography, were simple. He really had little leisure time. Walking was the most practiced sport, as he moved walking everywhere when he was in Bilbao and in Ondarroa he went over Lekeitio or Mutriku, accompanied by their children. He also practiced rowing and bathing on the beach. In 1922 he completed the construction of \\"Torre Urizar\\" and headquarters of \\"Banco de Bilbao\\" in Madrid. In turn, he was named architect of the entity, a position he held until his death. *1925-1926: In March he presented the plans for the project \\"Enlaces de Bilbao con los Pueblos Colindantes\\", which featured a sketch in 1923. Also, he proposed to centralize railways and bus lines in one station located in Abando. In 1926, he participated in the international planning competition for the extension of Bilbao, making a group with Marcelino Odriozola. Emiliano Amann organized a U.S. tour which Bastida and his eldest son joined. The group visited different cities, such as New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago and Detroit. *1927-1928: He presented two drafts for \\"El puente de Bego√±a\\", one mobile and the other fixed. That project and 1923's one, joined Abando and Deusto as mobile bridges that allowed the passage of ships. However, its high cost caused many misgivings. *1929-1932: The architect continued building detached houses in Ondategi. Bastida projected about twenty houses in Getxo, most commissioned by Sota. Moreover, in April 1932, the \\"Puente de Deusto\\" started to build. *1936-1937: Mobile bridges Deusto and town hall finally unite both sides of the river. But on the eve of the entry of the National Army in Bilbao (the June 19, 1937), the besieged command ordered to demolish the aforementioned bridges that had been so painstakingly built. On September 15, Ricardo, Bastida's eldest son and student of architecture, died in the war. Two days later, his funeral was held in Bilbao with the assistance of many people. Years later, the new mayor, Jose Mar√≠a de Areilza, commissioned Bastida the reconstruction of the movable bridges. *1938-1939: He reformed and expanded the first tuberculosis sanatorium building of Santa Maria, in Bilbao. In this, as in other religious or charitable work, he did not charge remuneration. As a result of hatreds and passions unleashed by the war and by the friendship he had with Prieto, Bastida suffered some records. He was not imprisoned, but suspended without salary and employment. Fortunately, the accusations were cleared, as the complainants themselves corrected their accusations and the architect, showing his goodness forgave them. After the civil war, Ricardo Bastida was 59 years old. Despite the hardships and affronts suffered, resumed his career with enthusiasm. *1940-1943: In 1941 he outlined a draft for other sanatorium in Santa Marina, now for tuberculous children. Also, he designed the \\"Estaci√≥n Central de Autobuses\\" in Bilbao. A year later, he planned with Emiliano Amann social homes of Torre Madariaga. And in 1943 he built the \\"Iglesia del Buen Pastor\\" in Lutxana. *1947-1950: By this time two of his sons were married and the family kept the habit of spending the summer in Ondarroa. Grandchildren were new companions of the architect on his strolls and the subjects of his photographs and films. The eager temperament might suggest otherwise, but Bastida was jovial and friendly in dealing with people. Additionally, he practiced his hobbies until the last moment. *1951-1953: This year he was part of the jury of the contest to reform San Mames Stadium, of Athletic Club de Bilbao. In 1952, Bastida began remodeling the central headquarters of \\"Banco de Bilbao \\" on Gran V√≠a. In the summer of 1953 he received reports from Mexico about the poor health of his friend Prieto and decided to visit him. On the plane he fell ill and went to the airport in bad condition, so he suspended all scheduled. Prieto, concerned about the health of Bastida, looked after him at home . A few days later, the architect was strengthened and quickly returned to Bilbao. When he returned, he underwent surgery, but died shortly at : 15 October 1953 (Bastida was 74 years ). Prieto wrote in memory of architect an article called \\"Mi m√°s querido amigo\\". These are some sentences of the article: \\" Mr. Bastida is one of the most distinguished Spanish architects and certainly one of the best men I have ever known .\\" And include the simplicity and humility of the architect, which was manifested in the plea he made before he died at his family: he asked to write in his obituary simply \\"Ricardo Bastida, Diocesan Architect\\", without adding even \\"Mr.\\" or title of \\"Most illustrious\\" which he possessed by the positions that he had occupied.

Munir opposed the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon imposed in 1920 and in 1925 left his job to join the revolt of Sultan al-Atrash. At the end of the revolt, in 1927, Rayyes returned to Damascus, where he was a regular writer for al-Hayyat. In August 1933 Rayyes became a founder member of the League of Nationalist Action, whose goal was to remove foreign political influence in the region. With the fading of the League in 1935, Rayyes moved to Palestine from 1936-38 to join Haj Amin al-Husseini in the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine. In 1938 he became the director of political affairs at the Damascus police department. In 1945, Munir founded a newspaper, Barada, working as its editor-in-chief, and another in support of Husni al-Za'im's 1949 coup, called al-Inkilab (The Coup d'Etat). His journalism included campaigning for women's emancipation (including giving his wife, Thuraya Al- Hafez, a platform; he also encouraged her to stand for election in 1953). On August 25, 1952, Barada merged with the Damascus daily paper al-Manar al-Jadid on the orders of Adib Shishakli, becoming al-Liwaa. The owner of al-Manar al- Jadid, Bashir al-Ouff, became editor-in-chief of the new paper, and Rayyes the director, until in 1954 the papers were split again. 1954 also saw a short- lived experiment with running a shareholding company to print Syria's four main papers, al-Qabas, al-Ayyam, Alif Ba', and al-Sham. Rayyes supported Arab nationalist movements in the 1950s and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt both during and after the United Arab Republic. Rayyes supported the 1963 Syrian coup d'√©tat but once their power was established, the Baath party closed Barada. Rayyes is also noted for his book Al-KitƒÅb al-Dhahabƒ´ li'l-ThawrƒÅt al- Wa·π≠aniyya fƒ´ al-Mashriq al- øArabƒ´: al-Thawra al-S≈´riyya al-KubrƒÅ (The Golden Book of Nationalist Revolutions in the Arab East).(Beirut: DƒÅr al-·π¨alƒ´ øa li'l-·π¨abƒÅ øa wa'l-Nashr, 1966) Sources Sami M.

It can also be used to describe the clothing combination. The term first became widespread in otaku slang as one of the attributes of moe characters in anime and manga, but it is now used by the general public in Japan. Classification and ideal proportions cosplaying Hatsune Miku The zettai ry≈çiki ratio for the length of the miniskirt, the exposed portion of thigh, and the over-knee part of the socks is 4:1:2.5, with a tolerance of 25%. The ratio has also been referred to as a among fans. Zettai ry≈çiki fans have also assigned letter grades for the ratio variants, from grade E (too much leg is seen, the skirt is also too long) to grade A (short skirt, high socks, short exposed area). Some fans have conceived of a grade S character which adds the criteria of a twintails hairstyle and a tsundere (cold on the outside, warm on the inside) personality. Origins The term originates from the 1995 anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, where it was used with a different meaning. In an insert leaflet that came with VHS cassettes, the expression was used as a translation of the English-language term from the anime into Japanese. An A.T. Field was a type of a protective energy shield, dubbed a and made a being using it impervious to attacks. Also, the term could refer to .Neon Genesis Evangelion, Episode 24 The Neon Genesis Evangelion manga also gave a shortened version of the term, \\"Zettai Ry≈çiki\\", in furigana next to the words \\"A.T. Field\\". The idea of a \\"holy area no one can intrude upon\\" was where the current meaning of the term originated. The expression first spread in the otaku community and then started to be widely used outside of the otaku subculture. For example, it is now included in the general- purpose dictionary Daijisen. Popularity Zettai ry≈çiki was originally only applicable to a combination of miniskirt and overknee socks, but with its popularization it started being used toward outfits which featured other kinds of hosiery and bottom clothing, including, for example, thigh highs, stockings, garters, hotpants, and swimsuits. The clothing combination is very popular in Japan. As with loose socks, a special \\"socks glue\\" can be used to glue the socks to the legs for a perfect look. Japanese advertising agency WIT launched a campaign in 2013 which paid women to wear temporary tattoos on their upper thighs promoting various products and media. They were encouraged to wear skirts and long socks to highlight the area.

Kenyon Ltd funeral of Margaret Thatcher in 2013, assisted by Leverton & Sons Role Usually privately owned and commercially operated businesses, the funeral directors to the Royal Household do not have more than an occasional role, although they will be called upon if a death occurs in the Royal Family to assist in arranging the funeral arrangements. The same companies are normally used to assist during state or ceremonial funerals of eminent people outside the Royal Family, for example Sir Winston Churchill or Margaret Thatcher. Although comparable in their role and function to Royal Warrant holders, the funeral directors serving the Royal Household do not traditionally advertise the fact that they work for the Royal Family. History It is not known when the Royal Household of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom began to employ privately owned and commercially operated funeral directors' companies. In the early 19th century, the royal undertakers were the family business of William Banting of St. James‚Äôs Street, London. The Banting family conducted the funerals of King George III in 1820, King George IV in 1830, the Duke of Gloucester in 1834, the Duke of Wellington in 1852, Prince Albert in 1861, Prince Leopold in 1884, Queen Victoria in 1901, and King Edward VII in 1910. The royal undertaking warrant for the Banting family ended in 1928 with the retirement of William Westport Banting.Todd Van Beck, \\"The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill\\", part II, in Canadian Funeral News (October 2012), Vol. 40 Issue 10, p. 10 (online ) After the Banting family had ceased to operate as royal funeral directors in 1928, several society undertaking firms lobbied for the warrant. It was finally awarded to the socially and politically well-connected Sir Harold Vaughan Kenyon, who also served six terms as Mayor of Paddington. His company had been established in 1880 by his father, James Harold Kenyon (1841-91) and was incorporated under the name of J. H. Kenyon Ltd in 1899. It was this company which oversaw the funerals of King George VI in 1952, Queen Mary in 1953, and Sir Winston Churchill in 1965. The company's chief embalmer during this period was Desmond Henley. Another London firm, William Garstin not J H Kenyon, assisted with the funeral arrangements for King George V. In 1991, the royal undertaking warrant passed to Leverton & Sons, a 200-year-old family firm of funeral directors. Leverton & Sons was established in St Pancras in 1763 by Devonshire carpenter John Leverton. In 1888, the business moved to Eversholt Street in Camden, north London, where its headquarters remain. In 2007 company director Clive Leverton explained the mode of appointment to The Telegraph. \\"'There is no written contract,' he said. 'It is just a handshake really.'\\" In 1997 Leverton & Sons assisted with the repatriation the body of Diana, Princess of Wales.

History The Jesuits arrived in Roehampton during the mid-nineteenth century and created a novitiate, Manresa House, which became Whitelands College, now part of the University of Roehampton. In 1869, they started a mission to the local Catholics in the area. In 1881, they decided to build a church that would permanently accommodate the congregation. They asked Frederick Walters to design the church for them. It was the first church he designed for the Jesuits and would go on to design more buildings for them, such as Sacred Heart Church, Wimbledon, St Winefride Church, South Wimbledon and the chapel of Wimbledon College. St Joseph Roehampton retrieved 5 February 2014 In 1948, the Jesuits left Manresa House and moved their novitiate to Harlaxton Manor.

Later on (since 1999) he was teaching Bengali language and literature in the Department of Indology of the University of T√ºbingen.Satyabrata Sarkar in: Ulrich Fellmeth, Kathrin Quast (Bearb.): Die akademischen Lehrer an der Universit√§t Hohenheim 1968‚Äì2005. Scripta-Mercaturae-Verlag, Stuttgart 2008, S. 136f. (online auf: uni-hohenheim.de)Fachbereich Indologie an der Universit√§t T√ºbingen  Education and career  Sarkar passed his Matriculation from the Uttarpara Government High School (1944), studied at Ripon College (now known as Surendranath College), Presidency College Calcutta (Bachelor of Science, 1948) and at the University of Calcutta (Master of Science, 1950). He worked on tissue culture of plants and the application of radioisotopes in biological research at the Bose Institute, Calcutta. From 1954 he was engaged in research at the Max Planck Institute for Biology in T√ºbingen (Departement Georg Melchers) and obtained his Doctorate from the University of T√ºbingen (1957). From 1959 he started with intensive studies on the structure and function of plant viruses and obtained his \\"Habilitation\\" from the University of T√ºbingen in 1969. After Habilitation he gave lessons in Virology and Genetics as an associate professor at the same university. From 1977 to 1995 he was engaged in teaching and research at the University of Hohenheim near Stuttgart. After retirement he started teaching Bengali (since 1999) at the University of T√ºbingen. Sarkar was trained in the use of isotopes in Biology at the Nuclear Research Center in Karlsruhe (Germany 1961), in studies on Genetics of Bacteriophages in the Department of Genetics, University of Cologne (1962) and in the structure of ribosomes at an EMBO workshop held in the Max-Planck- Institute for Molecular genetics in Berlin (1970).  Scientific achievements  His studies on the physiological background of the mechanism of flowering of higher plants revealed some interaction between the role of vernalisation (mainly cold treatment) and the direct effect of the plant hormone Gibberellic acid. He used, among others, two lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant, that has proved to be of great significance in modern Molecular Biology of plants. Working with the components of mutants of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) he analysed the behaviour of their coat proteins. These findings were the first experimental proof of the \\"trimer\\" character of this virus protein (Sarkar, 1960; Caspar, 1963). From a mutant of TMV with a defective coat protein he isolated a rare mutant, which had no coat protein but only the free nucleic acid (RNA). (Ref. 1981). The presence of this free RNA prevented the spread of other related TMV mutants, offering an early experimental proof of the phenomenon, later known as \\"Gene Silencing\\". Cellwall-free protoplasts of plant cells (mainly of tobacco and Chinese cabbage) were infected with viruses or with their RNA with a high efficiency and used for physiological investigations. Synergism between potao virus x and potato virus y was studied in vivo by classical methods as well as by ultrastructural, i.e. electronmicroscopic techniques.

The SADI-S is a type of type of bariatric surgery with a single surgical anastomosis. It has a restrictive component when reducing the greater curvature of the stomach, but specially a malabsorptive component, as the common channel is also reduced. The objective of this surgical technique is to lessen the intestinal loop where nutrients are absorbed. Technique It can be performed by laparotomy or laparoscopy. A small gastric sleeve is created by sectioning the greater curvature of the stomach, such as in the sleeve technique. Subsequently, the duodenum is transected respecting the pylorus. A duodenum-intestinal anastomosis is carried out, from the ileocecal valve. Therefore, the common channel where nutrients are absorbed becomes long. Advantages The SADI-S is a single anastomosis bariatric surgery. It is different from the classic duodenal switch, the gastric bypass (RNY) or sleeve gastrectomy. It is a type of bariatric surgery carried out to lose weight. Disadvantages Patients will need to take vitamin supplements A, D, E, K and minerals throughout their lives. Analytical monitoring is necessary to prevent malnutrition. Stones in the gallbladder, flatulence and diarrhea are more frequent. The surgical risks are similar as in other bariatric techniques, including intestinal perforation, anastomotic leaks, infection, abscess, venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In the long term, it can produce a bowel obstruction. There is a greater chance of bile reflux than a traditional duodenal switch. , it is still classified as experimental by all insurance companies and has no long term follow-up data. There is no research to indicate that it has any significant reduction in vitamin or mineral supplementation as compared to the classic duodenal switch.

He also currently performs a music project called SADONNA: sad versions of upbeat Madonna songs.  Selected Projects  = DEEP AEROBICS -- Death Electric Emo Protest Aerobics = A workout class in costumes playing on the themes of mortality, political protest, oppression, resistance and hope. It is over an hour of communal/political/conceptual/imaginational workout experience in public. It combines vigorous bouncing of one‚Äôs anatomical/spiritual/energetic molecules with the existential absurdity that is living in a world/country/economic system of injustice, war-mongering, and cultural ineptitude. = myendlesslove = Performed at Henry Street Settlement in 2006 and then reconstructed in 2013 at Abron Arts Center, the work explores sex, desire and growing older in gay culture. On the heels of one of the major works of his career and the worst breakup of his life, choreographer Miguel Gutierrez created myendlesslove (2006), a short, raw dance about grief. Brooklyn-based Gutierrez incorporates song, text, movement and video into his performance pieces. The new version starts off with Mr. Gutierrez, in person, holding a discussion with himself on video: ‚ÄúWhat are you going to show us today?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhatever happens.‚Äù As the question is repeated, the response becomes more lascivious: ‚ÄúI really hope it‚Äôs going to look beautiful, that you‚Äôre going to try all the possible variations and positions.‚Äù =Cela nous concerne tous (This concerns all of us) (2017)= Created in the fall of 2017 for Ballet de Lorraine in Nancy, France. Premiering during the company's 50th anniversary season, this piece takes its inspiration (and title) from the May 1968 social and political movements in France. =Age and Beauty (2014/15)= A trilogy of queer pieces that address queer time, futurity, and mid-life anxieties about relevance, sustainability and artistic burnout. = Variations on Themes from Lost and Found: Scenes from a Life and other works by John Bernd = Co-directed with Ishmael Houston-Jones, received a 2017 Bessie for Outstanding Revival. =This Bridge Called My Ass (2019)= In This Bridge Called My Ass, six Latinx performers map an elusive choreography of obsessive and perverse action within an unstable terrain of bodies, materials and sound. A formal logic binds the group and propels them to create an ever-transforming world where they are at once autonomous and connected, complicating the idea of identity. Latin- American songs and the form of the telenovela are exploited to show how familiar structures contain absurdity that reveal and celebrate difference. The title is a play on This Bridge Called My Back edited by Cherr√≠e Moraga and Gloria E. Anzald√∫a, a seminal 1981 anthology of Third Wave feminist essays that explores identity and critiques white feminism. Gutierrez had been piqued by the book since age 19.  Teaching  Gutierrez has taught regularly at a variety of festivals and intensives such as Forum Dan√ßa, La Caldera, ImPulsTanz, Camping/CND, SFADI, Lion's Jaw, American Dance Festival, Bates Dance Festival, MELT at Movement Research, Earthdance, Danza Com√∫n, New Aesthetics, Performatica, and Ponderosa and he has been a visiting guest professor at several universities including DOCH, Konstfack, P.A.R.T.S., Bennington College, Hollins University‚Äôs MFA Dance Program, School of Art Institute of Chicago‚Äôs Low Res MFA Art Program, Yale University‚Äôs MFA Program in Sculpture, RISD, Brown University, Carnegie Mellon University, UCLA, Princeton University, CalArts, University of Illinois, The New School/Eugene Lang, New York University's Experimental Theater Wing, Hunter College, and more He is the program director for LANDING, a community-building, non- academic educational initiative at Gibney. He invented DEEP AEROBICS in 2007, disseminated it for ten years, and then killed it in 2017. He is also a Feldenkrais Method practitioner. Writing and Published Texts His essays have been published in A Life in Dance and In Terms of Performance: A Keywords Anthology and BOMB Magazine (\\"Does Abstraction Belong to White People\\"). =When You Rise Up= A book of performance texts published by 53rd State Press. In the texts, Gutierrez gets inside the psyche of the 20- or 30-something generation ‚Äì people, according to Gutierrez, who often don't know what to do with themselves, where to put their energies, or how to act \\"powerful\\" among others. Driving the performance texts is a socio-political conscience, though one hyper-attentive to the clich√©s of a socially committed, queer-inflected dance culture and public discourse.

After generating more than 20 solid concepts for comics, he approached his brother Ron, whose interest was also sparked, and the two came up with numerous ideas. As the brothers were not themselves artists, they began searching for an illustrator, putting advertisements on the internet as well as visiting art and animation classes with no success. Brian eventually met Ronnie Martin, a visual artist and sign painter, after he saw him sketching before a choir performance in which both of their daughters were involved.

The \\"Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race\\" (now North Carolina A&T;) was established On March 9, 1891 by an act of the General Assembly of North Carolina and began in Raleigh, North Carolina as an annex to Shaw University. The college made a permanent home in Greensboro with the help of monetary and land donation by local citizens. The college granted admission to both men and women from 1893 to 1901, when the Board of Trustees voted to restrict admission to males only. This policy would remain until 1928, when female students were once again allowed to be admitted. In the second half of the century, N.C. A&T; experienced many changes. In 1967, The college was designated a Regional University by the North Carolina General Assembly and renamed \\"North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.\\" During this period, students would be involved with protests in connection to the Civil Rights Movement. Students staged sit-ins at local segregated businesses, and the campus served as the setting for a conflict between protesters and the US National Guard during the 1969 Greensboro Uprising. In 1971, the North Carolina General Assembly redefined N.C. A&T; as a regional university and through legislation make it a constituent of the University of North Carolina. In the 21st century N.C. A&T; was classified as a doctoral/research intensive university by the Carnegie Foundation. The university also generates contracts with major international companies, foundations and federal agencies securing funding to enhance academic programs, provide student scholarships, and reach its goal to position itself as a premier institution of higher learning and research on a state, national, and international level.  Founding and early years  John O. Crosby; N.C. A&T;'s First President (1892‚Äì1896) The US Congress laid the foundation for the establishment of North Carolina A&T; through the passing of The Second Morrill Act of 1890. Signed into law August 30, 1890, and aimed mainly at the confederate states, the second Morrill Act of 1890 required that each state show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for persons of color. Unlike the schools under the first Morrill Act, states were granted cash to establish the endowments to support these schools. In order to comply with the Second Morrill Act and yet prevent admission of African Americans to the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, the college's Board of Trustees were empowered to make temporary arrangements for students of color. On March 9, 1891, the \\"Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race\\" was established by an act of the North Carolina General Assembly as an annex of the private Shaw University in Raleigh. The act read in part: \\"That the leading objective of the college shall be to teach practical agriculture and the mechanic arts and such learning as related thereto, not excluding academic and classical instruction.\\" The college, which started with four teachers and 37 students, initially offered instruction in Agriculture, English, Horticulture, and Mathematics. The college continued to operate in Raleigh until the Board of Trustees voted, in 1892, to relocate the college to Greensboro. Other cities considered were Durham, Mebane, Raleigh, and Wilmington, North Carolina. With monetary and land donations totaling $11,000 and 14 acres (57,000 m¬≤), the new Greensboro campus was established the following year and the college's first President, John Oliver Crosby, was elected on May 25, 1892. The College Building built in 1893, was one of the campus' first buildings. It was destroyed by fire in 1930. The main building of the new college, called \\"the college building\\" was completed in 1893. The multi-purpose building served as dormitories for men and women, food service, classrooms and offices. The building was destroyed by fire in 1930. The college conferred its first degrees in 1899 to W.T.C. Cheek, I.S. Cunningham, and A. Watson receiving Bachelor of Science degrees & A.W. Curtis, E.L. Falkner, J.M. Joyner, and P.E. Robinson receiving Bachelor of Science in Agriculture degrees. The college granted admission to both men and women of color from 1893, until the Board of Trustees voted to restrict admission to males only in 1901. This policy would remain until 1928, when female students were once again allowed to be admitted. In 1904, the college developed a 100-acre farm equipped with the latest in farm machinery and labor-saving devices. During that time, the university farm provided much of the food for the campus cafeteria. In 1915, the North Carolina General Assembly changed the name of the college to Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina.  Expansion and growth  An early image of N.C. A&T; students working in the Biological laboratory With Land-grant colleges being required to provide military training as part of its core curriculum. The Junior Unit of Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) was inaugurated in 1919. This two-year program continued until the Senior Division R.O.T.C. was established in 1942, followed by the senior Air Force unit in 1951. In 1925, Dr. Ferdinand D. Bluford was selected as the third president of the college, and A&T; became a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association (now known as the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association). The next year, the College's National Alumni Association was established. In 1928, the 27-year ban on female students was lifted as the college once again was granted co-educational status. By December 1931, female students are allowed, for the first time, to participate in the student government as members of the student council. In 1939, the college was authorized to grant the Master of Science degree in education and certain other fields. Two years later, the first Master of Science degree was awarded to Roy Elloy. School of Nursing The 1940s and 1950s saw the college expand its land holdings. In 1946, the college acquired 96 acres of land adjacent to the original 14-acre campus In 1953, The School of Nursing was established, with the first class graduating four years later. 1955 saw more changes, as Dr. Warmoth T. Gibbs was selected as the fourth President of the College. Two years later, the college experienced another name change to the \\"Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina\\". In that same year, the college's first white student, Rodney Jaye Miller of Greensboro, was admitted. In 1959, the college was fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).  The Civil Rights Movement  The role that students of North Carolina A&T; have played during the 1960s has been controversial at times. On February 1, 1960, four freshmen men helped spark the civil rights movement in the southern United States. Ezell Blair (Jibreel Khazan), Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, and David Richmond \\"sat-in\\" at an all white eating establishment (Woolworth's) and demanded equal service at the lunch counter. The actions of the four freshmen gained momentum as other students of the university joined them in their non-violent protest to desegregate Woolworth's lunch counter, which became known as the Greensboro sit-ins. By the end of July 1960, Blair, McNeil, McCain and Richmond were dubbed the Greensboro Four. In 1964, John A. Steinhauer, a science teacher, was the first white student to earn a degree from A&T;, earning the Master of Science in Education with a concentration in Chemistry. The following year, the College acquired the land of the former Immanuel Lutheran College, a coeducational junior college located adjacent to the college campus. In 1967, The college was designated a Regional University by the NC General Assembly. The college was renamed \\"North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University,\\" and two academic divisions were established: the Division of Industrial Education and Technology and the Division of Business and Economics. On September 1 of the following year, the University's academic schools were reorganized into the following academic areas: School of Agriculture, School of Arts and Sciences containing the Division of Humanities, Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Division of Social Sciences, School of Education, School of Engineering, School of Nursing, School of Graduate Studies & Division of Business Administration. In 1969, students protesters from the college, in addition to students of nearby James B. Dudley High School, were involved in a four-day conflict with the Greensboro Police and the National Guard in which there was one casualty. The conflict, which lasted between May 21 through May 25, was sparked by perceived civil rights issues at the segregated high school, when a popular student council write-in presidential candidate was denied his landslide victory allegedly because school officials feared his activism in the Black Power movement. Starting on the campus of Dudley High School, the uprising spread to A&T; campus, where students had stood up in support of the Dudley protest. Escalating violence eventually led to an armed confrontation and the subsequent invasion of the campus. Described at the time as \\"the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university,\\" The uprising ended soon after the National Guard raided and raid of the 505-room male dormitory, W. Kerr Scott Hall, taking hundreds of students into protective custody. The one casualty as a result of the conflict, freshman Willie Ernest Grimes, was posthumously awarded the Bachelor of Science in 2008. Accepting the degree was Willie Grimes' mother, Mrs. Ella Grimes, who was accompanied by her son, N.C. A&T; alumnus George Grimes.  Recent years  In 1970, the Board of Trustees, created The School of Business and Economics. The following year, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation bringing all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor degrees into the University of North Carolina System. As a result of the consolidation, NC A&T; became a constituent institution and Lewis Carnegie Dowdy, the College's sixth president, was reappointed as the college's first chancellor in July 1972. On June 1, 1985, the School of Arts and Sciences was renamed to the College of Arts and Sciences by the Board of Trustees. two years later, The School of Technology was established. The 1988 school year saw NC A&T; set an enrollment record with 6,200 students. The following year, the college bested its record with a total of 6,500 students. In 2000, the University saw Dr. Carolyn W. Meyers become the University's first female Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs. The following year, Meyers would become the first Provost of the University. 2001 saw another gender first as Yaxi Shen became the first female to earn a Ph.D degree at NC A&T.; On March 31, 2003, the honors organization Phi Beta Kappa opened its 291st chapter at N.C. A&T.; In September of that same year, the university announced the creation of a Joint Millennial Campus, with neighboring UNC-Greensboro, with the intent to focus on regional economic development. The following year, the university was classified as a doctoral/research intensive university by the Carnegie Foundation, in addition to forming a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). On May 1, 2006, Lloyd V. Hackley was named Interim Deputy Chancellor of the university. Hackley served in the position until his successor. Stanley F. Battle was installed as the 11th Chancellor on April 25, 2008. Under the Battle administration, the university was awarded an $18 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for an Engineering Research Center, the first time an HBCU has been a lead institution for such a center. On May 22, 2009, Dr. Harold L. Martin, Sr. was elected as the twelfth Chancellor of the University. The following year, N.C. A&T; received approval to establish a Ph.D program in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) beginning in the fall of 2010. That same year, the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN) opened with 17 students in the doctoral program in nanoscience and 1 student in the professional master's program in nanoscience. According to the National Nanotechnology Initiative, The JSNN became one of fewer than 10 schools nationally to offer degree programs in nanotechnology, and is the only program created and operated collaboratively by two universities. In 2011, North Carolina A&T; received approval from the University of North Carolina Board of Governors for its Master of Science in Nanoengineering program, Offered through the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN). In addition to the M.S. degree the university was approved to offer a doctoral program in Nanoengineering.  Preeminence 2020  In 2010, university chancellor Harold L. Martin appointed a task force to create a new comprehensive strategic plan for the university. The Strategic Planning Resource Council (SPRC), The 35 member task force, made up of university administrators, faculty, staff, students and external stakeholders, was formed to examine of the university's current levels of performance, compared with peer institutions, identify areas of improvement, and create a bold, innovative and creative strategic plan for the university. Preeminence 2020's overall objective is to position the North Carolina A&T; to become a premier institution of higher learning and research on a state, national, and international level. The plan identifies almost 36 specific goals, which are divided into six broad categories: * Intellectual climate * Faculty excellence * Research Activity * Entrepreneurship and civic engagement * Diversity and inclusiveness * Academic and Operational excellence  Further reading    References  Category:North Carolina A&T; State University North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University ","title":"History of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University"},{"id":"42220016","text":"The 1984 United States Senate election in New Mexico took place on November 6, 1984.

Oxford University Press. . . is a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that emerge from capitalism in the schema of historical materialism within Marxist theory. The Marxist definition of socialism is that of an economic transition. In this transition, the sole criterion for production is use-value (i.e. direct satisfaction of human needs, or economic demands), therefore the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Marxist production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning. Distribution of products is based on the principle of \\"to each according to his contribution\\". The social relations of socialism are characterized by the proletariat effectively controlling the means of production, either through cooperative enterprises or by public ownership or private artisanal tools and self-management. Surplus value goes to the working class and hence society as a whole. The Marxian conception of socialism stands in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism, most notably early forms of market socialism based on classical economics such as mutualism and Ricardian socialism. Unlike the Marxian conception, these conceptions of socialism retained commodity exchange (markets) for labour and the means of production seeking to perfect the market process. The Marxist idea of socialism was also heavily opposed to utopian socialism. Although Marx and Engels wrote very little on socialism and neglected to provide any details on how it might be organized, numerous social scientists and neoclassical economists have used Marx's theory as a basis for developing their own models of socialist economic systems. The Marxist view of socialism served as a point of reference during the socialist calculation debate. According to The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx, \\"Marx used many terms to refer to a post-capitalist society‚Äîpositive humanism, socialism, Communism, realm of free individuality, free association of producers, etc. He used these terms completely interchangeably. The notion that 'socialism' and 'Communism' are distinct historical stages is alien to his work and only entered the lexicon of Marxism after his death\\".Hudis, Peter; Vidal, Matt, Smith, Tony; Rotta, Tom√°s; Prew, Paul, eds. (September 2018‚ÄìJune 2019). The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx. \\"Marx's Concept of Socialism\\". Oxford University Press. . . Marx himself did not use the term socialism to refer to this development. Instead, Marx called it a communist society that has not yet reached its higher-stage. The term socialism was popularized during the Russian Revolution by Vladimir Lenin. This view is consistent with and helped to inform early concepts of socialism in which the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Monetary relations in the form of exchange-value, profit, interest and wage labour would not operate and apply to Marxist socialism.  Mode of production  Karl Marx described a socialist society as such: Socialism is a post- commodity economic system and production is carried out to directly produce use-value rather than toward generating profit. The accumulation of capital is rendered insufficient in socialism as production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a planned fashion. However, there have been other concepts of economic planning, including decentralised and participatory planning. One of Marx's main manuscripts is a posthumous work called Grundrisse, published in 1953. In this work, Marx's thinking is explored regarding production, consumption, distribution, social impact of capitalism. Communism is considered as a living model for humans after capitalism. The emphasis is upon fair distribution of goods, equality and the optimum environment for humans to live in to develop themselves to their best capabilities (art, politics and philosophy, among others) to achieve happiness and to satisfy intrinsic needs. Marx's goal was to design a social system that eliminates the differences in classes between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In doing so, the tension and the power differences which force workers to labor in bad conditions for poor wages, disappear. According to Marx, capitalism is a system guaranteed to collapse because big companies would buy small companies, leading to monopoly. In such a scenario, a very small number of people control most of the money and power. Poverty for the masses would prevail. Significant capital to buy products from the capitalist production system would be unavailable. Marx postulated that if workers are paid enough so that they still are able to buy products in a capitalist market, they will become essential contributors in assuring the domination of capitalism worldwide. Market forces to compel capitalists to produce use- values in pursuit of exchange-value. Socialist production involves rational planning of use-values and coordination of investment decisions to attain economic goals.Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \\"The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism\\". Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists. p. 61‚Äì63. \\"More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs. [...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality.\\" In this approach, cyclical fluctuations that occur in a capitalist market economy do not exist in a socialist economy. The value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labour, cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system. Socialism makes use of incentive-based systems, so inequality would still exist, but diminishingly so since workers are worker- owners. In this way, inequality is also diminished and capital and power is more widely distributed. The method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic meritocracy along the principle of \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution\\". The advanced stage of socialism, referred to as the upper-stage communism in the Critique of the Gotha Programme, is based on the socialist mode of production. However, it is different from lower-stage socialism in fundamental ways. While socialism implies public ownership (by a proletarian semi-state apparatus) or cooperative ownership (by a worker cooperative enterprise), communism would be based on common ownership of the means of production. Class distinctions based on ownership of capital cease to exist, along with the need for a state. A superabundance of goods and services are made possible by automated production that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit.Marx, Karl (1875). \\"Part 1\\". Critique of the Gotha Program. \\"In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly ‚Äì only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\\"  Social relations  The fundamental goal of socialism from the view of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was the realization of human freedom and individual autonomy. Specifically, this refers to freedom from the alienation imposed upon individuals in the form of coercive social relations as well as material scarcity, whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself. The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the surplus product. As a set of social relations, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the associated producers so that the surplus product produced by socialised assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of labour power would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social division of labour which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labour which would still exist in socialism.Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell (1998). \\"Definitions of market and socialism\\". Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists. pp. 58‚Äì59. \\"For an Anti-Stalinist Marxist, socialism is defined by the degree to which the society is planned. Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves. Put it differently, the control over the surplus product rests with the majority of the population through a resolutely democratic process. [...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole. No one controls anyone else.\\" The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual labourers' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder. = Role of the state = In Marxist theory, the state is \\"the institution of organised violence which is used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists\\". The state is seen as a mechanism dominated by the interests of the ruling class. It subjugates other classes, to protect and legitimize the existing economic system. After a proletarian revolution, the state would initially become the instrument of the proletariat. Conquest of the state by the proletariat is a prerequisite to establishing a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes. Class distinctions, based on ownership of the means of production, gradually deteriorate. The concentration of means of production increasingly falls into state hands. Once all means of production become state property, the primary function of the state changes. Political rule via coercion over men diminishes through the creation and enforcement of laws, scientific administration and the direction of the processes of production. As a result, the state becomes an entity of economic coordination rather than a mechanism of class or political control and is no longer a state in the Marxian sense.Engels, Friedrich (1880). \\"The Development of Utopian Socialism\\". Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. Marxists Internet Archive. \\"In 1816, he declares that politics is the science of production, and foretells the complete absorption of politics by economics. The knowledge that economic conditions are the basis of political institutions appears here only in embryo. Yet what is here already very plainly expressed is the idea of the future conversion of political rule over men into an administration of things and a direction of processes of production.\\"  See also  * Capitalist mode of production * Communism * Economic planning * Green socialism * Law of value * Marxism * Marxian economics * Mode of production * Post-capitalism * Primary stage of socialism * Production for use * Relations of production * Scientific socialism * Socialist calculation debate * Socialist economics * Socialisation * Yellow socialism  References  Category:Economic ideologies Category:Economic systems Category:Marxism Category:Materialism Category:Modes of production Category:Political ideologies Category:Political movements Marxism ","title":"Socialist mode of production"},{"id":"42220089","text":"The Brunist Day of Wrath is Robert Coover's tenth novel. It is a sequel to The Origin of the Brunists, which told the story of Giovanni Bruno, the lone survivor of a mine disaster that killed 97 of his co-workers, and the first several months of the apocalyptic cult that formed around him, ending in their disastrous scattering. The Brunist Day of Wrath is set five years later, as the cult returns to West Condon. Coover had the idea for the sequel while writing The Origin of the Brunists, and has stated that \\"it might be said that all my writing has been written in Wrath‚Äôs shadow.\\" He took notes over the years, but concentrated on his other writings, until the 2000 election of Bush and the power of the religious right in American politics inspired him to take the sequel much more seriously.

Jenkins Meets Jesus Christ, Western Humanities Review, Summer 2013 *The Dance of the Annunciation, Kenyon Review, Fall 2013 *Cockcrow to High Noon, Golden Handcuffs Review, Fall-Winter 2013-4 Plot summary In the five years since the events of The Origin of the Brunists, the religion has grown, except in West Condon. Justin Miller has left town, taking a job with network TV. Abner Baxter has also left town, openly preaching Brunist. Eleanor Norton has written a successful book on Domiron and the Brunists. The teenage orphan Colin Meredith, after his rescue from the Brunists, was committed to the same mental hospital with Giovanni Bruno. Clara Collins, widow of Ely, has married Ben Wosznik. The mine entrance area, known as the \\"Mount of Redemption\\" to the Brunists, has been idle. The Reverend Wesley Edwards' Presbyterian church sold off their long unused camp grounds to local mine boss John P. Suggs, not knowing he was a Brunist sympathizer. Edwards' wife Debra makes Colin's redemption her great project, wrecking her marriage. Colin had seen Bruno being wheeled out of the institute after surgery, and reports he is dead. =Prologue= On July 7, the Reverend Joshua Jehoshaphat Jenkins, fresh out of Presbyterian seminary, is riding a bus to his first ministerial appointment. Expected to be met by Ted Cavanaugh, the town banker, at the bus station, he finds no one waiting and no message for him, so he leaves his stuff at the station and goes exploring West Condon on his own. Along the way, a driver for a lost army convoy asks Jenkins for directions to the high school, and when he shows him the only map he has, the driver assumes it was meant as a gift and takes it and leaves. Jenkins finds his church, and since it is open, enters. He finds Jesus at the pulpit waiting for him. They talk a bit, then a woman enters, similarly garbed as Jesus, tells him \\"those awful people are marching up that hill again,\\" with guns, and recommends they hide in the basement. Jesus decides to proceed onwards to the \\"infamous hill\\", since they are likely waiting for him, and over the woman's objections (\\"they're completely crazy!\\") invites Jenkins to join him. =Book I= On Sunday, 29 March, a very brief Easter sunrise outdoor service on a mud hill in the pouring rain is ended by a tremendous lightning-clap. Reverend Wesley has great difficulty leaving and is helped by Cavanaugh. Wesley has great difficulty controlling his inner Jesus, is deemed too senile to continue, and is being edged out of his duties. His wife Debra has openly left him for the Brunists, and his only supporter is Priscilla Tindle, church organist, who resumes their brief affair. The Brunists are rebuilding the former Presbyterian camp near the closed mine, in anticipation of a large crowd of followers showing up for the fifth anniversary of the Day of Redemption. Among the new people are Darren Rector, who is obsessive about Brunist numerology, eschatology and history, and Billy Don Tebbert, Darren's friend and disciple. Georgie Lucci, who survived the mine disaster and left town, has just returned to West Condon, a failure in the big city, moves in with his mother and is a failure again. He finds employment as the frontman for the city's fire inspection shakedown scam. Cavanaugh has problems on many levels. His wife Irene is dying, and has lapsed into an impenetrable fundamentalist mindset. He has to engineer the removal and replacement of the Reverend Edwards. His son Tommy, on Easter break from college, shows no aptitude for business, and is so obviously only interested in girls that he can't even let him work at the bank. He is trying to prevent the Brunist revival, partly made possible by his unthinking approval of the land sale his church had made the previous winter. Cavanaugh starts an affair with Stacy Ryder, an intern who is gifted as his girl Friday at the bank, and is also an older friend of Angela Bonali, who is renewing her own affair with Tommy. Driving back from meeting Stacy in a hotel an hour away on dark roads, Cavanaugh is attacked by the Warrior Apostles, a motorcycle gang. On Saturday, April 18, Brunists from across the country start arriving in force. This includes Abner Baxter and his family, including son Nathan, who is a member of the Warrior Apostles, who come with Nathan. The motorcycle gang robs some Brunist living quarters, and are expelled the next morning when their crime is discovered. Nathan's younger brother Paulie chooses to ride with the gang. On Sunday morning, Abner Baxter, Jr., and Elaine Collins engage in mutual flagellation. A crowd of townspeople, reporters, and law enforcement show up to the mine hill that morning. Tommy, with Sally Elliott assisting, is there, partly out of college educational research interests. Sally uses her family connections to join the Brunist camp for interviews. As she finishes interviewing the aged Harriet McCardle from Florida, the woman dies in her chair, and Sally flees. The Brunists arrange with the town's governance for an ambulance to quietly remove McCardle. Goaded by Cavanaugh's suspicions, a confrontation builds between townspeople and law enforcement, when the Warrior Apostles suddenly return, scare everyone, and hurl a dog's head and two decapitated doves at the crowd. The confrontation is over, the Brunist camp is found to have been trashed. The next day, some of the Brunists leave, others who gave up everything stay on, despite not having any place to stay. =Book II= Later that week, Cavanaugh learns that much of the Brunist funding comes from Debra Edwards stealing from her husband and his own wife using her separate bank account, apparently set up for tax evasion. He fires Bernice Filbert, her Brunist nurse, and arranges for Catholic nursing only. He arranges for the Chamber of Commerce executive director Jim Elliott to be fired. Mayor Maury Castle is resigning, under threat from unidentified Italians. Charlie Bonali joins the police force. The abandoned mine offices are found to have been broken into. It is hard to identify what might have been stolen, if anything, but the possibility that there had been some dynamite cannot be ruled out. Carl Dean \\"Ugly\\" Palmers, now calling himself Pach‚Äô (short for Apache), one of the original Brunists who served three years in prison after his assault on Miller, arrives in town. He has been fed up with religion since prison, tailing the Collins family from a distance, eager and frightened to see Elaine Collins again. The camp is celebrating the news that Suggs has successfully negotiated the purchase of the Mount of Redemption on their behalf. Darren is now predicting seven weeks of waiting, leading to a new date June 7 for the Rapture. Sally hits it off with Billy Don, to Darren's disapproval. They go hunting through cemeteries for the unknown graves of Giovanni and Marcella Bruno, and find what is certainly Giovanni's. To Darren's shock, the tombstone gives his date of death says June 7. Wesley (and his inner Jesus) go wandering when Priscilla runs errands. Wesley discovers his bank account has been closed, and flips out. Priscilla finds him at his old manse. She is pregnant. Saturday night, at the Blue Moon Motel, some of the motorcycle gang are hanging out on their last night in town. When two of them suspect a police set up, they steal Tommy Cavanaugh's station wagon to get their gear out. When they return, they find one of their gang has been beaten to death. The next morning, in a wooden area near the camp, they surprise Abner Junior and Elaine flagellating each other. They beat Abner and rape Elaine. They are interrupted by Pach', Debra, and then the rest of the camp, but make their escape. The Baxters are evicted. =Book III= Ben, Clara and Elaine take time off, visiting Brunist churches to the east. They return shortly before the June 7 dedication. Elaine is refusing to talk and refusing to eat, and has to be hospitalized and force-fed. Questioning Debra, Ben learns that the bikers were burying something. He looks for the spot, finds it, uncovers a cache of dynamite, and reburies it elsewhere. He will later find a second cache, and takes countermeasures. Franny Baxter escapes her hellish existence by marrying out. Tommy finally breaks off his affair with Angela when she tells him she's pregnant. Her brother Charlie beats Tommy severely, landing him in the hospital. Angela is fired from her bank job. Cavanaugh has the bank foreclose the Bonali house. Wesley's inner Jesus has taken over. Priscilla has great difficulty restraining him. The night before the dedication, the Baxterites stage a raid on the Brunist camp, cutting telephone wires and electricity. They are beaten back in an exchange of gunfire, with one of their own wounded. Several Baxterites are arrested, but only Abner is kept in jail for a time. The dedication of the camp proceeds without electricity. It is interrupted by the news that Suggs has had a major stroke. Dave Osborne's shoe store is going out of business, also facing foreclosure. Osborne distributes notices of a spectacular shoe sale. As a crowd lines up for the noon opening, they witness Osborne hang himself on a noose made of shoelaces. Cavanaugh has the sheriff finally arrest Debra for embezzlement. The evening service at the Brunist camp that night is interrupted by popping sounds. They investigate, and find an adulterous couple killed, apparently by the woman's husband, who has fled. Darren, who admires the Baxterites, is getting more self-righteous, spies on the other top Brunists, adopts Colin, and plans to set things right Lem Filbert's auto shop is torched. =Book IV= The biker gang, renamed The Wrath of God and with reinforcements, returns the night before the Fourth of July, and lure Sheriff Puller out of the way, using one of the Baxterites as bait, and kill both of them. The deputy sheriff, now acting sheriff, Calvin Smith, is a Baxterite. Sally finally seduces Tommy. Their night in a motel is ended prematurely when they run into Stacy and Cavanaugh in the motel's hallway. On July 5, at a ceremony for the dedication of a symbolic grave of Giovanni Bruno, the town leaders show up with Bruno, a shell of his former self, although the Brunists are skeptical. Darren approaches. Bruno says \\"Dark...Light\\", Darren reveals Eleanor Norton's gold medallion which he had stolen from Clara. Bruno crosses himself and falls to his knees and has a fit. A scuffle ensues, interrupted by explosions at the camp, which turn out to be booby traps set by Ben. Five bikers are killed, along with Ben. The bikers vow vengeance on all of West Condon. The Brunists plan on July 7 being the day of Redemption. Clara leaves the camp with her daughter Elaine, who being pregnant, has begun eating again. Early that morning Billy Don calls Sally and arranges to escape the madness with her. He is killed by Darren, who gives unsuspecting Abner Junior the gun. The National Guard, the state Governor with state police, and numerous journalists show up. The bikers engage in a reign of terror, blowing up buildings and cars all across West Condon. At the hospital, a nurse is forced at gunpoint to identify which room Suggs is in, and a biker proceeds to the room and shoots the helpless man. After the bank is blown open, the mayor shows up, and without anyone noticing, walks off with a million dollars and flees, using Lucci as his fall guy. At the mine, as the Baxterites are confronting the Brunists with armed private militia and surrounded by state and federal troops, Jesus walks up to the Mount accompanied by Jenkins and Priscilla. He delivers new, generally confusing, beatitudes, but Abner Baxter accepts them as genuine. The multiple confrontations end with most of the bikers dead, most of the Baxterites arrested, and the Brunists scattered. Jesus abandons Wesley, who is institutionalized. In fact Suggs is not dead-- the nurse had named a room where a man had just died--and Bernice takes Suggs home for safety. She negotiates a fantastic home care deal for herself (including a generous close-out payment upon death) with a lawyer who is taking over Suggs's assets. But when Sally learns Suggs is being mistreated, Bernice murders Suggs with a lethal injection. =Epilogue= Sally becomes a professional writer, and her first book is The Killing of Billy D, a bestselling non-fiction novel about the murder of Billy Don. Abner Junior is eventually cleared while on death row, but not his father. The novel ends with his execution.

History Four volunteer-based organizations had been largely response for volunteer efforts on Belle Isle. Friends of Belle Isle, a non-profit grassroots environmental organization, was founded in 1972 and was dedicated to the upkeep and preservation of Belle Isle through cleaning and the ridding of invasive species on the island. In 1988, the Belle Isle Botanical Society began raising money for projects to improve the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory. In 2004, the Belle Isle Women's Committee was created and its first project was to upgrade Sunset Point. The non-profit Friends of the Belle Isle Aquarium was formed in 2005 with the goal of restoring Belle Isles historic 100-year-old aquarium. In 2009, the four organizations put a plan in action to form a single organization that could pool all their efforts and ideas into a larger and more effective non-profit dedicated to improvement projects. The first stakeholder meetings were held in 2009 to see what advocates wanted for the park. A volunteer driven park user survey was conducted in 2010 ‚Äì with 2200 respondents. By 2010, planning began for a merger based on feedback from users and advocates, and a desire for stronger leadership. The four organizations voted in January 2011 to proceed with a merger. By the end of 2011, with assistance from the Cultural Alliance for Southeastern Michigan and the Michigan Nonprofit Association, the four organizations had officially merged into the single Belle Isle Conservancy. Operations The Conservancy is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, governed by a 19-member board of directors, with five members representing the City of Detroit: a seat appointed by the Mayor, one by the City Council, representatives from the Recreation Department and General Services Department, and the manager of Belle Isle in the Recreation Department. The organization operated in 2013 on a $1.2 million budget, including restricted funds, with $700,000 spent annually for park operations, and has 1 full-time and 2 part-time employees. The organization's first president, Michele Hodges, began in January 2013. Activities Initially the Conservancy continued the work that was already funded and started by the four founding organizations. In 2012, that represented an investment of nearly $800,000. Those efforts included restoration of the Horse Stables/Maintenance building roof, the Aquarium roof, improvements to the Lake Muskoday habitat, restoration of the Scott Fountain's Pewabic tiles, and improvements to the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory. The Conservancy assesses major structures and amenities to identify critical and immediate issues to be addressed. Currently the Conservancy focuses on five main areas. =Community engagement= Through membership and an active volunteer program, the Conservancy coordinates the efforts of thousands of individuals to help maintain and improve Belle Isle. =Fundraising for capital projects= The organization plans to launch a capital campaign to fund specific capital improvement projects. =Marketing= The Conservancy is working to become a source of information about Belle Isle, such as its history, current events and attractions, picnic shelter rentals and other amenities, and volunteer opportunities. =Park maintenance and operations= Belle Isle Conservatory The Conservancy will continue and expand the work started by the four founding organizations. This includes improvement to the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, renovation of Sunset Point, the use of the Aquarium for public events, annual events, and habitat restoration. =Research and planning= The organization will assess the condition of park buildings, facilities, the forest, canals and waterways, attractions and amenities, public sculpture and fountains, and other park features to determine options and priorities for improvements, maintenance and operations. Politics The Conservancy endorsed a plan that would lease Belle Isle to the state for 30 years and transition Belle Isle to a state park, which occurred in 2014. The organization made its endorsement after meeting with city and state officials.

History and profile O Tico Tico was founded by journalist Luis Bartolomeu de Souza e Silva, inspired by foreign magazines such as the French La Semaine de Suzette. The date of its first issue was October 11, 1905. Luis Bartolomeu de Souza e Silva also launched a satirical magazine, O Malho. O Tico Tico was published by the O Malho group. The magazine published comics by Brazilian artists such as Reco-Reco, Bol√£o e Azeitona, by Luis S√° and Lamparina, by J.

Enlisting into the army in 1875 he quickly rose through the ranks and was accepted into the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1876. He saw extensive active service with the French colonial army in the Pacification of Tonkin between 1887 and 1892, being cited in the order of the day for his adept command of columns of native infantry. Having married in 1893 Raffenel requested transfer to the France-based metropolitan army in 1894. This unusual move was complicated by the separate organisation of the two French armies but was approved by presidential decree. Raffenel spent 16 years in the metropolitan army and commanded the 27th Infantry Regiment and the elite 82nd Light Infantry Brigade. He was promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade in 1911 and received command of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Division, one of the finest divisions of the French Army. He fought with this unit at the Battle of Rossignol on 22 August 1914 and was killed in action in what was a heavy defeat for the French troops.  Early life and non-commissioned career  Raffenel was born at midday on 14 August 1856 at Saint-Servan, Ille-et-Vilaine. He was the son of Ame Jean Baptiste Raffenel, a marine commissioner and chevalier of the Legion of Honour; and of Hortense Marguerite Ho√´l, who lived in Saint-Servan. Raffenel enlisted in the army on 8 July 1875 for a five-year term and was posted to the 82nd Infantry Regiment as a 2nd class private. He was promoted to corporal on 15 January 1876 and to quartermaster-sergeant on 15 July that year.  Colonial service  Raffenel entered the Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr on 28 October 1876 as an officer-cadet, graduating on 1 October 1878 as a second lieutenant in the 1st Marine Infantry Regiment. Serving in Martinique from 16 March 1881, he received promotion to lieutenant on 16 April. Transferring to the 4th Marine Infantry on 25 May 1883, he returned to France on 9 July and was promoted captain on 8 December. Raffenel served as adjutant of the regiment from 31 March 1884. Raffenel transferred to the 4th Tonkinese Rifles on 10 September 1886 and took part in the Tonkin War from 18 January 1887. He fought at Muong-Vi on 10 April 1887 when he led the \\"Raffenel Column\\" and transferred to the 1st Tonkinese Rifles on 21 May 1887. He was awarded the Tonkin Expedition commemorative medal on 26 July 1887 and received a commendation recognising the energy and efficiency he displayed in the campaign. Raffenel was transferred to the 1st Marine Infantry on 22 December 1888 and returned to France on 12 March 1889, serving as regimental adjutant from 19 August 1889 to 8 August 1890. He was appointed a Chevalier of the Order of the Dragon of Annam on 7 February 1890. Raffenel was posted to the 2nd Tonkinese Rifles on 8 August 1890 and promoted to chef de bataillon on 3 October. Returning to Tonkin on 23 October 1890 he fought at Ben-Chan on 29 October 1890 as part of the \\"Pardes Column\\". A \\"Raffenel Column\\" was formed again between 29 November and 23 December 1890 and saw action at Ba√Øbang on 5 September, Doung-De on 7 December, Yen-Dong on 13 December and at Kher-Khong on 16 December. He served with the Domin√© Column and fought at Cai-Tram on 16 June 1891. He received a commendation for his actions during these operations: \\"as a captain and chef de bataillion he commanded several small columns of Tonkinese troops, demonstrating energy and initiative under very difficult circumstances\\". He returned to France on 25 March 1892 and joined the 6th Marine Infantry Regiment on 14 April 1892. He transferred to the 1st Marine Infantry on 1 June 1892, serving on detachment in Paris away from the regiment, and to the 5th Marine Infantry on 19 October 1893. Raffenel was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 29 December 1892. He married Fernande Marie Gabrielle on 11 April 1893. They lived at Saintes, Charente- Maritime, and had two sons.  Return to metropolitan army  Raffenel requested a transfer to the metropolitan army, in which he began his career as an enlisted soldier, in 1894 for \\"personal reasons\\". This was an unusual occurrence owing to the difficulty of transfer from the Troupes de Marine, under the authority of the naval office, to the army under the war office. He made the request in order to reduce the time he spent abroad on campaign, though whether this was due to family difficulties or health problems is unclear. He received a presidential decree authorising his transfer on 5 November 1894, having arranged to swap places with Chef de Bataillon Lourdel- Henault of the 136th Infantry Regiment. His new lieutenant-colonel was known to have welcomed this \\"valuable acquisition for the regiment\\". He became an officer of the Order of the Dragon of Annam on 25 January 1895. Raffenel served with the 136th Regiment in garrison at Querqueville, Cherbourg where he was described as \\"intelligent, educated, hardworking, very zealous, very dedicated, very active and a good rider, a valorous officer who may achieve high rank in the future\\". He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the 48th Infantry Regiment on 7 October 1899 and spent one year on detachment with the 35th Artillery Regiment, learning about artillery - particularly the 75mm gun - and lecturing to the artillery officers on infantry tactics. Afterwards Raffenel returned to the 48th Infantry at Guingamp where he served as second- in-command. He was promoted to colonel in the 27th Infantry Regiment on 8 July 1904 and was commended for his \\"military qualities : tact, firmness, discipline, excellent service and devotion to his duties\\", serving with them at Dijon. He transferred to the 85th Infantry Regiment and became commander of the 82nd Brigade on 28 September 1910. This brigade of light infantry, based at Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges, was one of the elite units of the French Army. A report of the time describes Raffenel \\"as a commanding officer very dignified, very dedicated, moderate and tactful, as a regimental commander he is sympathetic without lacking firmness. Esteemed and loved, he could not be more worthy to be promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade, a rank he deserves in all respects\\".  General  Raffenel was appointed as g√©n√©ral de brigade on 25 March 1911 and as an officer of the Legion of Honour on 29 March. He received command of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Division, one of the finest in the French Army, which marked a return to the colonial army of his early career after 20 years with metropolitan units. Upon the outbreak of the First World War Raffenel led his division from Brest to Bar-le-Duc on the Belgian frontier. On 22 August he led it over the Semois River into the Belgian village of Rossignol. There, surrounded by the German VI Corps, and fighting for six hours on a 600m wide front, the division was heavily defeated. French losses were devastating - some 11,000 of the 15,000 men in the division were casualties, making Rossignol the deadliest action of the Battle of the Frontiers. The 1st colonial Brigade ceased to exist as a formed unit; the 1st Colonial Infantry Regiment lost 2,500 killed and wounded, the 2nd lost 2,850, the 3rd 2,085 and the 7th 1,500. Of Raffenel's cavalry, the 3rd African Chasseurs Regiment, there remained just one and a half squadrons fit for duty. Both Raffenel and the commander of the 3rd Colonial Brigade, General Charles Rondony, were killed in action that day and General Montignault, commanding the 1st Colonial Brigade, was wounded and taken prisoner. Raffenel, who had been shot, and Rondony were the first French general officers to die during the war. His body was discovered after the battle by Captain Hartmann of the 3rd Colonial Infantry Regiment but was later recovered and buried at Tintigny by the German forces.

He translated the fourteenth satire of Juvenal for his father's version, and wrote the comedy Husband his own Cuckold, performed in 1696, with a prologue by his father, and an epilogue by William Congreve. An account of a tour in Italy and Malta, made by him in 1700 in company with a Mr. Cecil, was published in 1776. He died in Rome on 28 January 1701.

He is a F42/T42 category athlete. At the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships he threw a competition record to take the gold medal. Sport career Sveinsson was born in Reykjav√≠k in 1979. A keen sportsman, he played handball at a semi-professional level for several Icelandic clubs. His sporting career was halted when he was diagnosed with bone cancer. At the age of 20, in an attempt to combat the disease his left leg was amputated above the knee. In 2010 he was introduced to Paralympic sport, and in 2011 took on a coach. His natural athletic ability allowed Sveinsson to compete in multiple fields, competing in the long jump, sprint and javelin throw. In his first international competition, the 2012 IPC European Championships in the Netherlands, he took silver in the javelin. At the same Championships he also finished third in the 200m, but did not medal due to the low level of athletes competing in the event. In 2012 Sveinsson was one of four competitors to represent Iceland at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Sveinsson qualified in all three of his fields, and competed in the javelin, long jump and 100m sprint. He was also given the honour of being flag bearer for his country at the opening ceremony. In the long jump he was entered into the F42-44 category, but his first round best of 4.25m was not good enough to see him progress through to the final rounds. In the 100m T42 heats, Sveinsson recorded a time of 15.64s, a time way below his personal best and finished in 5th place, failing to qualify for the final round. In the F42 javelin, he threw a personal best of 47.61m in the opening round to progress to the final eight. He failed to better his early throw and finished fifth, just over a metre outside the medal positions. After the 2012 Paralympics Sveinsson was reselected for Iceland when he made the squad for the 2013 IPC Athletics World Championships held in Lyon, France. At the World Championships, he only entered the javelin throw and was faced with a strong field including Paralympic medalists Fu Yanlong of China and Runar Steinstad of Norway. Sveinsson threw a distance of 50.9m, a new Championship record, to win the gold medal.

Originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1981, it was delisted on June 1, 2011, following its destruction by fire. History The original structure was built in 1910 by Conro Fiero, an orchardist, for his wife, Grace Andrews, a Broadway actress. Also known as Woodlawn Acres, the house was the main residence on a estate which was referred to by its original owners as Woodlawn Orchard. They lost the property during World War I when the fruit industry became unstable. From the mid 1940s the building began to be used as a restaurant, becoming one of the most historic restaurants in the Rogue Valley area over a period of about 50 years. George T. and Lillian E. Ehrheart acquired of the estate, along with the house, in 1943, opening a restaurant that served \\"Southern-style chicken dinners\\" in 1946 but it closed within six months. Afterwards a fine-dining establishment was set up by Alex and Julie Tummers. It was the Tummers who first named their restaurant \\"Mon Desir\\" which means \\"my desire\\" in French. This restaurant remained in operation for ten years. The property was bought by Stanley and Tommie Smith in 1966 and they continued using it as a restaurant until 1979. They added a banquet room and an additional bar in the dining area. The popularity of the restaurant grew during this time as it was listed among the top 250 North American dining establishments. \\"Mon Desir\\" then passed into the hands of Russ Walters from 1979 to the 1980s, and then to several other owners, eventually ceasing to function as a restaurant in 2002. It was purchased by the most recent owners, Edic Sliva and Lisa Tollner for $1.7 million in 2005. They bought the property along with other adjoining parcels of land, intending to turn the area into a development consisting of condominiums. Construction never got off the ground. Several other attempts to revive the structure were made. Karaokes were sometimes held there and attempts were made to film a horror movie in 2007 and 2008 but lack of funding stalled the effort. William Link also attempted to revive the old restaurant. The house, located at 4615 Hamrick Road, Central Point, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1981. On Monday January 11, 2010, an early morning fire destroyed the structure, causing it to be delisted on June 1, 2011. Design Construction and design of the house is attributed to Whitehouse & Fouilhoux, owned by Morris H. Whitehouse and J. Andr√© Fouilhoux. It was a one-and-a-half-story bungalow built in the Arts and Crafts style. Construction was completed in 1910. The main structure had a rectangular plan and faced Hamrick Road towards the east. It stood off some from the roadway by a lawn and a driveway. On either end of the front facade there was a projecting gabled roof with overhanging eaves, faced with barge boards. The upper half of the gables was decorated with timber in horizontal and s-curve shapes. The lower half of the facade was covered with weatherboards. Wings were added on either end towards the back in 1965 and 1968, giving it a U-shape. A lounge was added on one end and an enlarged kitchen towards the other. Two-thirds of the front facade was taken up by a veranda with a sloping roof. The portion of the roof above the veranda was further enhanced with a gable-roofed dormer, decorated with bargeboards and a multi-paned window. The veranda consisted of paired columns. The entrance to the inside was from this veranda. There were three doorsthe main door with doors on either side. Each door was hung with strapwork hinges believed to have been custom-made by Honeyman Hardware of Portland. The interior of the structure was finished with plaster and paneling. A chimney, faced with bricks, was also present. Other features included a chimney stack in close proximity to the main structure, towards the southern end. Built of brick, the chimney also had a corbelled necking and a tapered flue liner. There are two double-hung windows. There was also a well house with a hipped roof towards the rear.

Inspiration Perker and Kristensen have said the main character was inspired by their interaction with Kristensen‚Äôs nephew who visited the two creators in New York City and interpreted some very ugly scenes on the city streets in an incredibly positive way. Reception Todd, The Ugliest Kid on Earth has received wide praise for its humor and artwork. Bloody Disgusting has praised its \\"biting satire of celebrities, TV personalities, and even Comic-Con\\" and comparing M.K. Perker's illustrations to Norman Rockwell paintings. Unleash The Fanboy has called the series an \\"attack on sanity\\" and \\"is equivalent to some of the best satire and comedy that you'd see on almost any late night on cable\\". Geeks of Doom has called the series creators Ken Kristensen and M.K. Perker \\"endlessly talented individuals\\" but described the series as polarizing saying, \\"a book brilliant in its delivery yet ultimately not for everyone\\". Danny Trejo, a fan of the series, also wrote the introduction for the second issue The second volume (trade paperback) features a foreword from Larry King and an afterword by Mark Duplass, lampooning themselves and their relation to Satan.

Opened on January 25, 2013, it is owned by the City of Cleveland and serves Cleveland and Bradley County.  Facilities  The airport contains a 6,200 foot by 100 foot concrete runway, an 8,000 square foot terminal building, a thirty-five foot wide taxiway, a 311,452 square foot apron, and twenty hangars. History =Background= Cleveland Regional Jetport was constructed to replace Hardwick Field, established in 1955 and located about to the west. Hardwick field consisted of a asphalt runway. By the early 1970s, many local leaders had come to view Hardwick Field's facilities as inadequate for the community. In 1973, a newly-elected city commissioner proposed a new general aviation airport for the city to be constructed at a new site, and later that year, a proposal was unveiled to double the length of the runway to . Further efforts continued throughout the 1980s. In 1991, then-newly elected mayor of Cleveland Tom Rowland set a goal for a new general aviation airport for the city. A study commissioned by the city in 1994 identified 18 possible sites for a new airport, including the one near the Tasso community. The push for a new airport was further energized in March 2000, when then-governor Don Sundquist flew into Hardwick Field and expressed his opinion that the facility was the \\"worst airport in the state.\\" In 2004, the Cleveland City Council authorized the creation of the Cleveland Municipal Airport Authority. On January 28, 2005, several proposals to lengthen and expand the runway at Hardwick Field, which would have required additional purchased land, were presented to the airport authority. At the time, then-chairwoman of the airport authority Lynn Devault expressed doubt that another site would be found for a new airport. Many residents living around the airport expressed opposition to these proposals, and requested that the city pursue and new site instead. After the proposed expansions of Hardwick Field were ruled unfeasible, the airport authority began reviewing sites from the 1994 study, and settled on the site on Dry Valley Road, then a series of farms. This proposal was also met with opposition, however. The authority, which chose not to acquire land via eminent domain, soon worked a deal with the property owners to sell the land, and on August 21, 2006, the Bradley County Commission voted 10-4 to rezone the property. On April 11, 2007, then-governor Phil Bredesen announced that the state would provide a $4.35 million aeronautics grant for property acquisition and preliminary engineering for an environmental impact statement of the property. =Construction= Construction of the new airport was split into three phases. The contract for phase one of construction, which including wetland mitigation and preliminary work, was signed on November 20, 2009. The project officially began on April 19, 2010. Phase 2 was awarded on September 20, 2010. This phase involved leveling and excavating 2.2 million cubic yards of dirt onto the site and slightly rerouting and constructing a culvert over a small stream which ran through the site. Construction of the new airport also required the relocation of Tasso Road, which ran through the property. This was accomplished by rerouting the road around the airport, creating a straight stretch nearly long parallel to the runway, which some have come to jokingly nickname the airport's second runway. The name Cleveland Regional Jetport was selected by the airport authority on December 16, 2011. The contract for the final phase of construction, the construction of the runway, was awarded on April 20, 2012. The jetport officially opened on January 25, 2013 with a runway. Hardwick Field closed on December 31, 2013. The entire project cost $42.32 million, with $36.376 coming from the state and federal government, $5.943 from the city, and additional funds coming from private donors, including businessman Allan Jones. =Later history= The Jetport was named Airport of the Year by the Tennessee Aeronautics Commission (TEC) in March 2014. In 2017 the runway was extended to 6,200 ft.

Religious denominations Bloom discusses include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Christian Science, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Southern Baptist Convention. Summary Bloom lays out his conception of a practice of religious criticism, by which he does not mean criticism of religion. He distinguishes the practice from other aspects of religious studies (e.g., history of religion or philosophy of religion) by analogy with his practice of literary criticism.Bloom (2006), p. 22. Bloom says, literary criticism involves aspects of history et cetera, but is distinguished by having a focus on aesthetic judgments concerning literature. Bloom's religious criticism thus will involve history et cetera, but also pay attention particularly to the spiritual values of religions.Bloom (2006), p. 3. In this book, Bloom begins this practice by looking at religious groups in the United States of America. Bloom identifies Ralph Waldo Emerson and William James as previous scholars who practiced religious criticism of American religion.Bloom (2006), pp. 11‚Äì12. He concludes that in America there is a single, dominant religion of which many nominally distinct denominations are a part. Among these he identifies Mormonism, the Southern Baptist Convention, Pentecostalism, and Seventh-day Adventism. To a lesser extent however, he also includes nearly all \\"Christian\\" denominations in America, including mainline Protestantism and Roman Catholicism.Bloom (2006), p. 4. Bloom's view is that all of these groups in America are united by requiring that each person may only truly meet with the divine when experiencing a \\"total inward solitude\\" and that salvation cannot be achieved by engaging with a community, but only through a one-to-one confrontation with the divine.Bloom (2006), p. 16. While Bloom suggests that this American form of religion is to some extent a continuation of Enthusiasm in Europe, American religious groups are rightly distinguished from traditional Christianity: Although all of these groups identify as Christian, Bloom believes they represent a radical departure from the core aspects of that religion.Bloom (2006), p. 33. Bloom says that the American religion is rather more like a form of Gnosticism.Bloom (2006), p. 4. Bloom says that the events of the Second Great Awakening at Cane Ridge were formative for the American religion.Bloom (2006), p. 15. Bloom regards the American Religion as successful by his standards for religious imagination; however, he distinguishes this success from the social and political consequences of the religion.Bloom (2006), p. 4. At times he criticizes elements in the American religion for their political activities, saying even that he is \\"politically appalled by what may be some of its consequences. Since the Reagan-Bush national Republicans have become one with the American Religion, my fear is that we will never again see a Democrat in the Presidency during my lifetime.\\"Bloom (2006), p. 46. Publication history The first edition was published by Simon & Schuster in 1992 with the full title, The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation. The second edition was published by Chu Hartley Publishers in 2006 without the subtitle and included a new afterword. Reception In Reviews in American History, Henry F. May writes that the work is \\"brilliant and original\\" and that \\"Historians interested in American religion ... will do well to read it and think about what it says.\\" He also however criticizes Bloom for being \\"unabashedly subjective and sometimes wrong-headed\\" and using \\"sweeping generalizations\\".May, Henry F., \\"Democratic Gnosticism: The American Religion?\\", Reviews in American History, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1993), p. 185. Writing in Commentary, Richard John Neuhaus dismissed the book as \\"a 288-page imaginative flirtation with nonsense\\".Neuhaus, Richard John, \\"Reviews: On Faith: The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation By Harold Bloom\\", Commentary (September 1992), p. 58. Neuhaus says that Bloom's interpretations of various denominations unduly ignore the explicit statements from these religious groups.Neuhaus (1992), p. 57 & 58. Writing in America, James P. Hanigan says that Bloom offers \\"suggestive and important insights\\", particularly the claim that traditional Christianity is not well-suited to Americans, and that the belief in direct experience of God is connected to anti-intellectualism. Hanigan suggests though that Bloom's argument is motivated by his own \\"Gnostic\\" spirituality, and concludes that it is, in the end, unpersuasive.Hanigan, James P., \\"Book Review: The American Religion by Harold Bloom\\", America (October 3, 1992), p. 219.

He was a son of Southern Tang's founding emperor Li Bian (Emperor Liezu). During the reign of his brother Li Jing (Emperor Yuanzong), he was initially designated the heir, but, having never embraced that role, repeatedly offered to yield the position to Li Jing's son Li Hongji. Eventually, Li Jing agreed, but Li Hongji, still fearing that Li Jing would change his mind again, had Li Jingsui poisoned to death.  During Wu  Xu Jingsui was born in 920, during the reign of Yang Longyan the King of Wu. His father, then known as Xu Zhigao, was serving as Wu's junior regent at the Wu capital Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), with his adoptive father (Xu Jingsui's adoptive grandfather) Xu Wen the regent taking up position at Jinling and in actual control of the Wu state.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 134. His mother was Xu Zhigao's second wife Lady Song Fujin, who was also the mother of his older brothers Xu Jingtong and Xu Jingqian and younger brother Xu Jingda. Xu Jingsui was the third son overall. By 936, Wu's titular ruler was Yang Longyan's younger brother Yang Pu, who had taken imperial title by that point; Xu Jingsui's father Xu Zhigao was the regent, stationed at Jinling, with Xu Jingtong also there serving as his deputy. The role that Xu Zhigao formerly had during Xu Wen's regency, as junior regent at the Wu capital Guangling, was held by Xu Jingqian, who was Xu Zhigao's favorite son. However, in 936, Xu Jingqian fell ill, and was removed from the junior regency and recalled to Jinling in hopes of recuperation. Xu Jingsui, then 16, was sent to Guangling to serve as junior regent, carrying the titles of Menxia Shilang () and Can Zhengshi (), as a de facto chancellor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. (Xu Jingqian would not recover, however, and would die in 937.)  During Southern Tang  = During Li Bian's reign = In 937, Yang Pu yielded the throne to Xu Zhigao, ending Wu. Xu Zhigao took the throne as emperor of a new state of Southern Tang. He created Xu Jingsui, who had arrived at Jinling as part of the procession of Wu officials offering the throne to him on Yang's behalf, the Prince of Ji. He also commissioned Xu Jingsui the titles of Shizhong (), defender of the eastern capital (as Jinling became the Southern Tang capital, with Guangling becoming the eastern capital with the name of Jiangdu (), and mayor of Jiangdu. He had Xu Jingsui lead the officials who were assigned offices in Jiangdu back to Jiangdu. In 938, Xu Zhigao recalled Xu Jingsui to Jinling, to participate in the matters of the office of chancellors, overseeing the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. When Yang died later in 938, it was Xu Jingsui that Xu Zhigao sent to attend to the funereal train. Xu Jingsui was overcome with grief, and those who saw him were touched. In 939, Xu Zhigao changed his surname back to his birth name of Li, and took a new name of Li Bian. His children also changed their names to Li, and Xu Jingsui thus took the name of Li Jingsui. Not long after, Li Jingsui's title was changed to Prince of Shou.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. In 942, when the senior statesman Song Qiqiu insisted on taking over the executive bureau, Li Bian had Li Jingsui yield the oversight of the executive bureau to him, and instead had Li Jingsui oversee the legislative (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and examination (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) bureaus instead, but also having Li Jingsui's older brother Li Jingtong (whose name had been changed to Li Jing by this point) oversee all three bureaus. Shortly after, Song's close associate Xia Changtu () was involved in a corruption scandal, but Song initially did sentence him to death. Li Bian, in anger, personally ordered Xia's death. Song thus resigned his oversight over the executive bureau and was no longer meeting the emperor. Li Bian had to send Li Jingsui to his mansion to comfort him and promise to make him the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) in order for him to come to the palace, upon which Song was given the Zhennan command.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. = During Li Jing's reign = Li Bian died in 943. Li Jing, as the oldest son, was expected to be the heir, and while he initially offered the throne to Li Jingsui instead, Li Jingsui earnestly declined, and Li Jing thereafter took the throne. He created Li Jingsui the greater title of Prince of Yan. Shortly after, Li Jing, believing that it was Li Bian's will that he pass the throne in succession to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda, created Li Jingsui (who then was also carrying the titles of Zhongshu Ling (), mayor of Jinling, and military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) ‚Äî a completely honorary title as Tianxiong was under the rule of Southern Tang's northern neighbor Later Jin) the Prince of Qi ‚Äî a title that Li Bian and Li Jing successively carried before they became emperor. He also had Li Jingsui take up residence at the eastern palace ‚Äî traditionally, the residence for the Crown Prince ‚Äî thereby effectively designating him as heir. He also publicly declared his intention to pass the throne to Li Jingsui and Li Jingda (who took over the title of Prince of Yan). Both Li Jingsui and Li Jingda repeatedly declined their new titles, but were not allowed to. However, Li Jingsui still had no desire to be heir, and decided to take, as his courtesy name, Tuishen ‚Äî from the Tao Te Ching passage \\"withdraw your body after you complete your accomplishment\\" (ÂäüÊàêÂêçÈÅÇË∫´ÈÄÄ, gongchengming suishentui) ‚Äî to show his lack of desire to be heir. (Li Jing's close associate Feng Yanji wanted to use this opportunity to block off the other officials' access to Li Jing, and therefore persuaded Li Jing to issue an edict that the officials could only meet with and report to Li Jingsui; however, when the senior imperial guard officer Jia Chong (), weeping, pointed out that this meant that Li Jing would not be able to see what was actually occurring in the imperial administration (which was what Feng wanted) and that, if the edict took effect, Jia himself would never be able to see the emperor again, Li Jing withdrew the edict.) In 947, Li Jing formally created Li Jingsui Crown Prince. (Li Jingda received the title of Prince of Qi, and Li Jing's oldest son Li Hongji, previously the Prince of Nanchang, became the Prince of Yan.) There was an occasion when Li Jingsui was meeting with his staff, but was paying attention to jade while staff member Zhang Yi () wanted to discuss his (Li Jingsui's) behavior. Zhang, in anger, grabbed a jade cup that Li Jingsui was holding and threw it on the ground, breaking it and shocking the entire staff. Instead of becoming angry, Li Jingsui apologized, and thereafter treated Zhang better.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. On a subsequent occasion, when Li Jing wanted to send Zhang on an embassy, over the sea, to Liao, Li Jingsui personally wrote a petition to Li Jing urging against it, stating, \\"Zhang Yi is man who can support the state. He should be kept around to offer advice day and night. He should not be sent over the unpredictable sea.\\" Li Jing, however, responded, \\"Zhang Yi is an unusual man, such that even the god of the sea would fear him.\\" He sent Zhang on the embassy anyway. By 958, Southern Tang had lost a war against Later Zhou (the successor state to Later Han, which had succeeded Later Jin), and had been forced to cede its territory north of the Yangtze River to Later Zhou, as well as formally submit as a subject). Li Jingsui used this opportunity to submit, 10 times, petitions offering to yield his crown prince position, particularly citing his own lack of contributions to the military effort and Li Hongji's contributions in repelling the attack of Later Zhou's vassal state Wuyue during the war. Li Jing accepted his petition and created Li Hongji Crown Prince to succeed him. Li Jingsui was created the Prince of Jin, and was given the additional titles of Tiance Shangjiangjun (), generalissimo of Jiangnan West Circuit (i.e., Zhennan, but Li Jing intentionally using the more archaic Tang title for it for impressive effect), grand commandant of Zhennan's capital Hong Prefecture (), Taiwei (), and Shangshu Ling (). Upon Li Jingsui's arrival at Zhennan, he, citing the fact that, given the recent losses to Later Zhou, Zhennan was now potentially exposed to war as well, requested an official as his deputy. Li Jing thus sent Li Zhenggu () to Zhennan to serve as his deputy military governor. However, Li Zhenggu was arrogant and dominant, such that even though Li Jingsui was himself magnanimous and relaxed, he became unable to bear Li Zhenggu as time went by. He considered killing Li Zhenggu and then report to Li Jing to confess, but was urged not to by his close associates. He became unhappy, however. Meanwhile, Li Hongji, as crown prince, had sometimes carried out unlawful deeds. Li Jing, angry, had once caned Li Hongji, and, as he did, stated, \\"I will summon Jingsui back!\\" There also happened be a time when false accusations were laid against the son of Li Jingsui's staff member Yuan Congfan (), such that Li Jingsui was considering executing Yuan's son. When Li Hongji heard of this, he secretly sent Yuan poison to encourage Yuan to poison Li Jingsui. On a day after Li Jingsui returned to his mansion after playing polo and was thirsty, Yuan gave him milk laced with poison. Li Jingsui drank it and died. Li Jing was greatly saddened. His servants, wanting to lessen his sadness, falsely stated to him that when Li Jingsui fell ill, he stated, \\"Shangdi is having me replace Xu Jingyang (i.e., the Taoist deity Xu Xun).\\" Li Jing believed them, and did not look into the matter further. He posthumously honored Li Jingsui as a crown prince.  Notes and references  * Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 19. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 280, 281, 282, 283, 286, 294.

She is known for her studies of the Olduvai Gorge sediments, focused on the water supplies available to hominids and the paleoclimate of the region. She has participated in multi-disciplinary projects that include meteorology, oceanography, paleoanthropology, and archaeology. She has served in professional organizations in the fields of sedimentology and geology, including the presidency of the Geological Society of America, the second woman to hold that post.  Early life and education  Ashley was born Gail Mowry in Leominster, Massachusetts, on January 29, 1941. Her interest in geology developed at a young age under the tutelage of a neighbor and professor of geology. She earned a bachelor's degree in 1963 and a master's degree in 1972, both in geology, from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In 1977 Ashley received a Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia for research on sediment transport in tidal rivers.  Research career  In 1977, Ashley was hired at Rutgers University, where she currently serves as a full professor. During the first 23 years at Rutgers, she was the only female tenured professor in the Geology Department where she also served as a role model and mentor for students. She has served as editor for several journals, including as the first female editor of the Journal of Sedimentary Research and the Geological Society of America Bulletin.

Her studies of sediment in Olduvai Gorge includes springs that co-existed with early hominids and their potential as water sources. Her research includes glacial stability in Antarctica, the Brooks Range, Ireland, and the northeastern United States where she also examines the effects of prior glaciation on marshes and wetlands. Her research in Antarctica came after being denied a research opportunity twenty years earlier because of her sex. Ashley's current research in East Africa is in the Rift Valley of Kenya and Tanzania where she focuses on the reconstruction of paleoenvironments and paleoclimate origins. Her interpretations of the paleoenvironment are based on her studies of modern physical processes and deposits of glacial, fluvial, lacustrine, arid landscapes. Her additional research projects include the scientific interpretation and history of ground water discharge in spring, seeps and wetland areas and the Critical Zone concept to deep time application.  Honors and awards  From 1991‚Äì1992, Ashley was the president of the Society of Economic and Petroleum Mineralogists and chaired the Northeast Section of the Geological Society of America (GSA). She is active in the Association of Women Geoscientists to bring more women into scientific fields. From 1998‚Äì1999, she presided over the GSA and was the second female president in its history. From 1998 to 2002 she served as vice president of the International Association of Sedimentologists. In 2012, Ashley was the recipient of the GSA's Laurence L. Sloss Award for lifetime achievements.

For example, the gene FasR is categorized as being a receptor, involved in apoptosis and located on the plasma membrane. Researchers performing high-throughput experiments that yield sets of genes (for example, genes that are differentially expressed under different conditions) often want to retrieve a functional profile of that gene set, in order to better understand the underlying biological processes. This can be done by comparing the input gene set with each of the bins (terms) in the GO ‚Äì a statistical test can be performed for each bin to see if it is enriched for the input genes. The output of the analysis is typically a ranked list of GO terms, each associated with a p-value.  Background  = The Gene Ontology = The Gene Ontology (GO) provides a system for hierarchically classifying genes or gene products into terms organized in a graph structure (or an ontology). The terms are groups into three categories: molecular function (describing the molecular activity of a gene), biological process (describing the larger cellular or physiological role carried out by the gene, coordinated with other genes) and cellular component (describing the location in the cell where the gene product executes its function). Each gene can be described (annotated) with multiple terms. The GO is actively used to classify genes from humans, model organisms and a variety of other species. Using the GO it is possible to retrieve the set of terms used to describe any gene, or conversely, given a term, return the set of genes annotated to that term. For the latter query, the hierarchical system of the GO is employed to give complete results. For example, a query for the GO term for nucleus should return genes annotated to the term \\"nuclear membrane\\". = Interpreting high throughput data = Certain types of high-throughput experiments (e.g. RNA seq) return sets of genes that are over or under expressed. The GO can be used to functionally profile this set of genes, to determine which GO terms appear more frequently than would be expected by chance when examining the set of terms annotated to the input genes. For example, an experiment may compare gene expression in healthy cells versus cancerous cells. Functional profiling can be used to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms associated with the cancerous condition. This is also called term enrichment or term overrepresentation, as we are testing whether a GO term is statistically enriched for the given set of genes.  Methods  There are a variety of methods for performing a term enrichment using GO. Methods may vary according to the type of statistical test applied, the most common being a Fisher's exact test / hypergeometric test. Some methods make use of Bayesian statistics. There is also variability in the type of correction applied for Multiple comparisons, the most common being Bonferroni correction. Methods also vary in their input ‚Äì some take unranked gene sets, others ranked gene sets, with more sophisticated methods allowing each gene to be associated with a magnitude (e.g. expression level), avoiding arbitrary cutoffs.

From the early 16th century, the French had historic claims to some of the lands in the New World that the Spanish called La Florida. The French crown and the Huguenots led by Admiral Gaspard de Coligny believed that planting French settlers in Florida would help defuse religious conflicts in France and strengthen its own claim to a part of North America. The Crown wanted to discover and exploit valuable commodities, especially silver and gold, as the Spanish had done with the mines of Mexico and Central and South America. The political and religious enmities that existed between the Catholics and Huguenots of France resulted in the attempt by Jean Ribault in February 1562 to settle a colony at Charlesfort on Port Royal Sound, and the subsequent arrival of Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re at Fort Caroline, on the St. Johns River in June 1564. The Spanish laid claim to a vast area that included the modern state of Florida along with much of what is now the southeastern Unites States on the strength of several expeditions in the first half of the 1500s, including those of Ponce de Leon and Hernando de Soto. However, Spanish attempts to establish a lasting presence in La Florida failed until September 1565, when Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s founded St. Augustine about 30 miles south of Fort Caroline. Menendez had not known that the French had already arrived in the area, and upon discovering the existence of Fort Caroline, he aggressively moved to expel those whom he considered heretics and intruders. When Jean Ribault learned of the Spanish presence nearby, he also decided on a swift assault and sailed south from Fort Caroline with most of his troops to search for St. Augustine. However, his ships were struck by a storm (possibly a tropical storm) and most of the French force was lost at sea, leaving Ribault and several hundred survivors shipwrecked with limited food and supplies several miles south of the Spanish colony. Meanwhile, Menendez marched north, overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Fort Caroline, massacred most of the French Protestants in the town, and left an occupying force in the rechristened Fort Mateo. Upon returning to St. Augustine, he received news that Ribault and his troops were stranded to the south. Menendez quickly moved to attack and massacred the French force on the shore of what became known as the Matanzas River, sparing only the Catholics among the French. With Fort Caroline captured and the French forces killed or driven away, Spain's claim to La Florida was legitimized by the doctrine of uti possidetis de facto, or \\"effective occupation\\", and Spanish Florida stretched from the Panuco River on the Gulf of Mexico up the Atlantic coast to Chesapeake Bay, leaving England and France to establish their own colonies elsewhere. But while Spain's rivals did not seriously challenge its claim to the vast territory for decades, a French force attacked and destroyed Fort Mateo in 1568, and English pirates and privateers regularly raided St. Augustine over the next century. Fort Caroline Portrait of the French mariner, Jean Ribault (1520 ‚Äì 1565) 17th century map of French Florida by Pierre du Val Jean Ribault founded his colony at Port Royal in 1562, having previously come upon the St. Johns, which he called la Rivi√®re de Mai (the River of May), because he saw it on the first of that month. Two years later, in 1564, Laudonni√®re landed at the Indian town of Seloy, the site of present-day St. Augustine, Florida, and named the river la Rivi√®re des Dauphins (the River of Dolphins) after its plentiful dolphins; moving north, he established a settlement at Fort Caroline on the south side of the St. Johns, six miles from its mouth. Philip II of Spain, who regarded the possession of Florida as necessary for the safety of Spanish commerce, hearing that Ribault, who had returned to France, was organizing another expedition for the relief of his colony of Huguenots across the Atlantic, determined to assert his claim to the possession of Florida on the ground of prior discovery, and root out the French at all costs. Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s had already been authorized to settle there, and his force was increased to enable him first to expel the French. Laudonni√®re, in the meantime, had been driven to desperation by famine, although surrounded by waters abounding with fish and shellfish, and had been partially relieved by the arrival of the ship of the English sea dog and slave trader Sir John Hawkins, who furnished him a vessel to return to France. They were awaiting fair winds to sail when Ribault appeared with his timely provisions and reinforcements. The plan of returning to France was then abandoned, and every effort made to repair Fort Caroline. The expedition of Men√©ndez had been badly storm-beaten, but at last he reached the coast with part of his fleet, only to find Ribault already there with his force. Men√©ndez then founded and named St. Augustine (San Agust√≠n) on September 8 1565. Ribault, who had awaited this arrival of the Spaniards, and had instructions to resist them, decided to attack Men√©ndez at once, and although opposed by Laudonni√®re, insisted on taking on board the ships nearly all the able-bodied men of the fleet and colony, so as to attack and crush the Spanish project. Laudonni√®re was left in the small fort on the St. Johns with the women, the sick, and a handful of men. Plano del Fuerte de San Agustin de la Florida. A plan view of one of the earliest Spanish forts built at St. Augustine, with figures of the day and night sentinels, the places where the soldiers fight, cannon, etc. Meanwhile, Men√©ndez, after gathering his men to hear Mass around a temporary altar, traced the outline of the first Spanish fort to be built in St. Augustine, at a spot located near the site of the present Castillo de San Marcos. At the time the French cruisers that preyed on Spanish commerce showed little mercy to the people taken in the richly laden galleons, unless their rank or wealth gave hopes of a large ransom; the Spaniards, when French cruisers fell into their hands, were unsparing as well. Men√©ndez placed his main reliance on the fort, and every one of the people he had landed now labored to throw up the earthworks and defenses, while he superintended the disembarkation of artillery and ammunition, supplies and tools. During the work some of Ribault's vessels appeared‚Äîthey might have made a dash and captured the Spanish commander, but they merely reconnoitred, and retired to report. The work on defenses continued apace, and Men√©ndez, unable to compete with the French on the sea, sent off his larger vessels, retaining only some light craft. The French fleet soon appeared, but Ribault faltered. Had he landed, success was possible; a way was open for retreat by land and water to his fort on the St. Johns. However, he chose to stand off. Men√©ndez, a more practiced seaman, saw that he had an advantage; he had scanned the sky for weather signs, and knew that a norther was coming. The French fleet would be swept before it and perhaps be wrecked, or escaping that, be driven so far that days would elapse before Ribault could make an attack. Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues (1533-88) Men√©ndez decided in his turn to attack the French fort, and deprive Ribault of that refuge. Guided by Indians, Men√©ndez, with a force of picked men, trudged through the swamps during the storm, and though many of his men fell back, he arrived at Fort Caroline, where the sentinels, unsuspecting of danger, were sheltering themselves from the rains. The Spanish attack was brief and successful. Laudonni√®re escaped with a few companions to a vessel in the river, leaving his command to be slaughtered by Men√©ndez. The French fort was overrun, and the Spanish flag was raised above it. Meanwhile, the settlers at the fort of St. Augustine were made anxious by the fierce storm that threatened the destruction of their wooden houses and all they had, and feared that French ships could have laid up from the storm in some neighboring harbor, ready to attack them before Men√©ndez returned. Adding to this anxiety, the deserters who came back to the fort declared that the Asturian sailor, ignorant of military operations, would never return alive. Eventually a man was sighted who approached the settlement shouting. When near enough to be understood, he cried that Men√©ndez had taken the French fort and put all the French to the sword. A procession was formed to go forth and meet the victor. Soon after his triumphant reception in the fort, Men√©ndez heard of Ribault's party having been wrecked, and learned that a detachment had made its way to Matanzas Inlet. After an ineffective interview and an offer of 100,000 ducats ransom, the Huguenots surrendered to Men√©ndez, and met the same fate as their comrades at Fort Caroline. A second party, with Ribault himself, were also slain at the hands of the Spanish. A few, however, who belonged to the Catholic faith, were spared. The Indians, who had been particularly friendly with the French, resented the Spanish invasion and the cruelty of Men√©ndez, and led by their chief Saturiwa, made war upon the Spanish settlers. The latter were running short of provisions and mutinied during the absence of Men√©ndez, who had gone back to Cuba for relief, and who finally had to seek it from the King in person in 1567. Dominique de Gourgues, captain in King Charles IX's army and avenger of the Spanish massacre of Fort Caroline Laudonni√®re and his companions, who had safely reached France, had spread exaggerated accounts of the atrocities visited by the Spanish on the unfortunate Huguenots at Fort Caroline. The French royal court took no measures to avenge them. This was reserved for Dominique de Gourgues, a nobleman who earlier had been taken prisoner by the Spaniards and consigned to the galleys.McGrath 2000, p. 163 From this servitude he had been rescued, and finally returned to France, from where he made a profitable excursion to the South Seas. Then with the assistance of influential friends, he fitted out an expedition for Africa, from which he took a cargo of slaves to Cuba, and sold them to the Spaniards. From this point he sailed for Florida, aided by some Spanish deserters. His force readily entered into the scheme of attacking Fort San Mateo, as Fort Caroline was called by the Spaniards. As his galleys passed the Spanish battery at the fort, they saluted his ships, mistaking them for a convoy of their own. De Gourgues returned the salute to continue the deception, then sailed further up the coast and anchored near what would later become the port of Fernandina. One of De Gourgues's men was sent ashore to arouse the Indians against the Spaniards. The Indians were delighted at the prospect of revenge, and their chief, Saturiwa, promised to \\"have all his warriors in three days ready for the warpath.\\" This was done, and the combined forces moved on and overpowered the Spanish fort, which was speedily taken. Many fell by the hands of French and Indians; De Gourgues hanged others where Men√©ndez had slaughtered the Huguenots. De Gourgues barely escaped capture and returned home to France. Men√©ndez was chagrined upon his return to Florida; however, he maintained order among his troops, and after fortifying St. Augustine as the headquarters of the Spanish colony, sailed home to use his influence in the royal court for their welfare. Before he could execute his plans he died of a fever in 1574. History =Men√©ndez pursues the French fleet= Portrait of Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, after a painting by Titian On Tuesday, September 4, Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, adelantado of La Florida, set sail from the harbor of what was to become the presidio of St. Augustine, and coasting north, came upon four vessels lying at anchor off the mouth of a river. These were Jean Ribault's flagship, the Trinity, and three others of his ships, which the Frenchman had left at the mouth of the St. Johns because they were too large to pass the bars in safety. One of them was flying the Admiral's flag, another the flag of the Captain. Men√©ndez recognized at once that the French reinforcements had arrived before him, and called a council of his captains to consider what action should be taken. In the opinion of the council it was deemed advisable to sail to Santo Domingo and to return to Florida in March of the following year. But Men√©ndez thought otherwise. His presence was already known to the enemy, four of his ships were so crippled by the gale that they could not make good time, and he believed that if the French should give chase to his fleet, they could outsail it. He concluded that it was better to attack at once, and, having beaten them, to return to St. Augustine and await reinforcements. His advice prevailed, so the Spaniards proceeded on their way. When within half a league of the French a thunderstorm passed over them, followed by a calm, and they were compelled to lie still until ten o'clock in the evening, then a land breeze sprang up, and they again got under way. Men√©ndez had given orders to approach the French ships bow to bow, and then to wait and board them at daybreak, for he feared they would set fire to their own vessels and thus endanger his, and would then escape to land in their rowboats. The Frenchmen soon perceived the Spanish approach and began firing at them, but their aim was directed too high, and the shot passed harmlessly between the masts without doing any damage. Ignoring the discharge and without reply Men√©ndez kept on his course until, passing right in their midst, he drew up the bow of the San Pelayo between that of the Trinity and another of the enemy's ships. Then he sounded a salute on his trumpets and the French replied. When this was over Men√©ndez asked, \\"Gentlemen, from where does this fleet come?\\" \\"From France,\\" answered a voice from the Trinity. \\"What are you doing here?\\" \\"Bringing infantry, artillery, and supplies for a fort which the King of France has in this country, and for others which he is going to make.\\" \\"Are you Catholics or Lutherans?\\" he asked next. \\"Lutherans, and our General is Jean Ribault,\\" came the response. Then the French in turn addressed the same questions to the Spaniards, to which Men√©ndez himself replied: \\"I am Captain-General of the fleet of the King of Spain, and I am come into this country to hang and behead all Lutherans I may find by land or sea, and in the morning I will board your ships; and if I find any Catholics they will be well treated; but all who are heretics shall die.\\" In the silence which prevailed while the parley was in progress, those aboard his ship heard a boat put out from one of the Frenchmen, carrying a message to their flagship and the reply of the French commander, \\"I am the Admiral, I will die first,\\" from which they inferred that it was a proposition to surrender. When the conversation was ended there followed an exchange of abuse and foul words, until Men√©ndez ordered his crew to draw their swords and to pay out the cable so as to board at once. The sailors showed some hesitation, so Men√©ndez sprang down from the bridge to urge them on and found that the cable was caught in the capstan, which caused some delay. The Frenchmen had also heard the signal and, taking advantage of the momentary pause, cut their cables, passed right through the Spanish fleet, and fled, three vessels turning to the north and the other to the south, with the Spaniards in hot pursuit. Men√©ndez' two ships took the northerly course, but the three French galleons outsailed him, and at dawn he gave up the chase. He reached the mouth of the St. Johns at ten o'clock in the morning to pursue his original plan of seizing and fortifying it. On attempting its entrance he discovered three ships up the river and at the point of the land two companies of infantry, who brought their artillery to bear upon him. So he gave up trying to capture the entrance and made for St. Augustine. The three Spanish vessels which took the southerly course in pursuit of the remaining French ship continued the chase all night. Men√©ndez had ordered them to rejoin him at the mouth of the St. Johns in the morning, and, if unable to do so, to return to St. Augustine. A storm arose and they were obliged to cast anchor off the coast, the vessels being so small they dared not to take to the sea. One of the three broke away, and while in this peril a French ship was sighted, but it did not attack them, although it hove to within a league of their own ship. =Founding of St. Augustine= Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s moved his colony to the settlement of the Seloy tribe of the Timucua. Their chief gave them the Great House, a huge circular or oval thatched structure able to hold several hundred people. Around this meeting house the Spanish dug a moat and added fortifications. The following day, Thursday, September 6, after sighting a second French vessel they made for a nearby harbor, which proved to be that of St. Augustine, and on landing found that the other two vessels had preceded them, having also arrived the same day. The harbor was near the village of an Indian chief named Seloy, who received them cordially. The Spaniards at once went to work to fortify a large Indian dwelling, probably a communal house, which lay near the water's edge. They dug a trench around it and threw up a breastwork of earth and fagots.Father Francisco L√≥pez de Medoza Grajales, Lyon translation 1997:6.Historical Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/histarch/eyewitness_accounts.htm This was the beginning of the Spanish colony at St. Augustine, which became the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the United States. When, in May of the following year, the settlement was temporarily moved to what was considered a more advantageous position on Anastasia Island, the first location received the name of San Agust√≠n Antigua (Old St. Augustine) from the Spaniards. Men√©ndez at once began disembarking his troops, landing two hundred of them. On Friday, September 7, he sent his three smaller ships into the harbor, and three hundred more colonists were landed, along with the married men, their wives, and children, and most of the artillery and ammunition. On Saturday, the feast of Our Lady of Charity, the balance of the colonists, one hundred in number, and supplies were put ashore. Then the Adelantado himself landed amidst the waving of flags, the sounding of trumpets and other instruments, and the salutes of the artillery. The chaplain, Mendoza, who had gone ashore the previous day, advanced to meet him, chanting the Te Deum Laudamus and carrying a cross which Men√©ndez and those with him kissed, falling upon their knees. Then Men√©ndez took possession in the King's name. The mass of Our Lady was solemnly chanted, and the oath was administered to the various officials in the presence of a large concourse of friendly Indians who imitated all of the postures of the Spaniards. The ceremony was concluded by the serving out of food to colonists and Indians alike. The negro slaves were quartered in the huts of the Indian village and work on the defenses proceeded with their labor. While these events were in progress, two of Ribault's ships, which the Spaniards had chased on the night of September 4, made a demonstration at the mouth of the harbor, offering combat to the San Pelayo and the San Salvador, which were unable to cross the bar on account of their size, and lay outside exposed to attack. The challenge was not accepted, and after watching from a distance the landing of the troops, the Frenchmen sailed away the same afternoon, and returned to the mouth of the St. Johns. Men√©ndez feared Ribault would return, attack his fleet while he was unloading, and perhaps capture the San Pelayo, which carried the major part of his supplies and ammunition; he was also anxious to send two of his sloops back to Havana for reinforcements. For these reasons the unloading was pushed rapidly forward. In the meantime he strengthened his position, and sought what information he could obtain of the situation of the French fort from the Indians. They told him that it could be reached from the head of the harbor of St. Augustine, without going by sea, probably indicating a way by North River and Pablo Creek. On September 11 Men√©ndez wrote from St. Augustine his report to the King of the progress of the expedition. In this first letter written from the soil of Florida, Men√©ndez sought to provide against those difficulties which had proved the chief obstacle to both the French and Spanish colonies before him. In two days the ships were for the most part unloaded, yet Men√©ndez was convinced that Ribault would return as soon as possible, so that the San Pelayo did not wait to discharge its entire cargo, but set sail for Hispaniola at midnight on September 10, with the San Salvador, which was carrying the admiral's dispatches.LauterNovoa 1990, p. 106 The San Pelayo took with her some passengers who proved to be of concern to the zealous Catholics. On leaving Cadiz, Men√©ndez had been informed by the Seville Inquisition that there were \\"Lutherans\\" in his fleet, and, having made an investigation, he discovered and seized twenty-five of them, whom he dispatched in the two vessels to Santo Domingo or Puerto Rico, to be returned to Spain. At the very time Men√©ndez was killing \\"Lutherans\\" in Florida, the \\"Lutherans\\" aboard the San Pelayo, convinced of the fate which awaited them in Seville, rose against their captors. They killed the captain, master, and all the Catholics aboard, and made their way past Spain, France, and Flanders, to the coast of Denmark, where the San Pelayo was wrecked and the heretics appear finally to have escaped. Men√©ndez also sent two sloops to Havana for the reinforcements expected to arrive with Esteban de las Alas, and for horses. He especially counted upon the latter in his campaign against the French, as he had lost all but one of those he had shipped in from Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the French at Fort Caroline had remained without news of the outcome of the attack. But on the reappearance of two of his vessels at the mouth of the St. Johns, Ribault went down the river to learn what had happened. He met on his way out a boatload of men returning from one of the ships, who told him of their encounter with the Spaniards, and informed him that they had seen three of the enemy's ships in the River of Dolphins and two more in the roads, where the Spaniards had disembarked and were fortifying their position. Crispin de Passe the Elder Ribault returned at once to the fort and, entering the chamber of Laudonni√®re, who lay there sick,Pickett Pickett 2011, p. 78 proposed in his presence and that of the assembled captains and other gentlemen, to embark at once with all of his forces in the four ships which lay in the harbor, for the Trinity had not yet returned, and to seek the Spanish fleet. Laudonni√®re, who was familiar with the sudden storms to which the region was subject during September, disapproved of his plan, pointing out the danger to which the French ships would be exposed of being driven out to sea, and the defenseless condition in which Fort Caroline would be left. The captains, who had received from a neighboring chief confirmation of the landing of the Spaniards and of the defenses which they were erecting, also advised against Ribault's plan, and counselled him at least to await the return of the Trinity before executing it. But Ribault persisted in his plan, showed the unwilling Laudonni√®re Coligny's instructions, and proceeded to carry it into effect. Not only did he take all of his own men with him, but carried off thirty-eight of the garrison and Laudonni√®re's ensign, leaving behind his treasurer, the Sieur de Lys, with the sick lieutenant in charge of the depleted garrison. On September 8, the very day that Men√©ndez was taking possession of Florida in the name of Philip, Ribault embarked aboard his fleet, but waited two days in the harbor until he had prevailed upon Captain Fran√ßois L√©ger de La Grange to accompany him, although La Grange was so distrustful of the enterprise that he wished to remain with Laudonni√®re. On September 10, Ribault sailed away. If the muster-roll of Laudonni√®re is accurate, the garrison which Ribault left behind him to defend Fort Caroline was ill-fitted to resist an attack of the well-fed and well-disciplined Spanish soldiery. The total number of colonists remaining in the fort was about two hundred and forty. Three days passed without any news of Ribault, and with each passing day Laudonni√®re became more anxious. Knowing the proximity of the Spaniards, and dreading a sudden descent upon the fort, he resolved to make shift for his own defense. Although food stores were depleted, as Ribault had carried off two of his boats with the meal which had been left over after making the biscuit for the return to France, and although Laudonni√®re himself was reduced to the rations of a common soldier, he yet commanded the allowance to be increased in order to lift the morale of his men. He also set to work to repair the palisade which had been torn down to supply material for the ships, but continued storms hindered the work, which was never completed. =Destruction of Fort Caroline= The French flag of the 1500s that flew over Fort Caroline Ribault made at once for St. Augustine with two hundred sailors and four hundred soldiers,LauterNovoa 1990, p. 108 which included the best men of the garrison at Fort Caroline. At dawn the next day he came upon Men√©ndez in the very act of attempting to pass the bar and to land a sloop and two boats filled with men and artillery from the San Salvador which had sailed at midnight with the San Pelayo. The tide was out and his boats so loaded that only by great skill was he able to cross it with his sloop, and escape; for the French, who had at once attempted to prevent his landing and thus to capture his cannon and the supplies he had on board, got so close to him, that they hailed him, and summoned him to surrender, promising that no harm should befall him. As soon as Ribault perceived that the boats had gotten out of his reach, he gave up the attempt and started in pursuit of the San Salvador, which was already six or eight leagues away. Two days later, in confirmation of Laudonni√®re's forebodings, so violent a norther arose that the Indians themselves declared it to be the worst they had ever seen on the coast. Men√©ndez at once realized that the proper moment had presented itself for an attack upon the fort. Calling his captains together, a mass was said to bring him sagacity in forming his plans, and then he addressed them with words of encouragement. He then set before them the advantage which the moment presented for an attack upon Fort Caroline, with its defenses weakened by the absence of Ribault who might have taken the best part of its garrison with him, and Ribault's inability to return against the contrary wind, which in his judgment would continue for some days. His plan was to reach the fort through the forest and to attack it. If his approach was discovered, he proposed, on reaching the margin of the woods which surrounded the open meadow where it stood, to display the banners in such a way as to lead the French to believe that his force was two thousand strong. A trumpeter should then be sent to summon them to surrender, in which case the garrison should be sent back to France, and, if they did not, put to the knife. In the event of failure the Spaniards would have become acquainted with the way, and could await at St. Augustine the arrival of reinforcements in March. Although his plan failed to meet with general approval at first, it was finally agreed upon, and so it came about that Men√©ndez was able to write to the King in his letter of October 15 that his captains had approved his plan. Men√©ndez's preparations were made promptly; he placed his brother Bartolom√© in charge of the fort at St. Augustine, in case of the return of the French fleet. He then selected a company of five hundred men, three hundred of whom were arquebusiers and the remainder pikemen (soldiers armed with muzzle-loading firearms and with spears) and targeteers (men armed with swords and buckler shields). On September 16 the force assembled at the call of trumpets, drums, fifes, and the ringing of the bells. After hearing mass, it set out, each man carrying on his back his arms, a bottle of wine, and six pounds of biscuit, in which Men√©ndez himself set the example. Two Indian chiefs, whose hostility the French had incurred, and who had visited Fort Caroline six days before, accompanied the party to show the way. A picked company of twenty Asturians and Basques under their captain, Martin de Ochoa, led the way armed with axes with which they blazed a path through the forest and swamps for the men behind them, guided by Men√©ndez who carried a compass to find the right direction. The point of land on which Fort Caroline was situated is separated from the seacoast by an extensive swamp through which flows Pablo Creek, which rises a few miles from the head of North River. It was necessary for the Spaniards to go around this, for all of the creeks and rivers were full and the lowlands flooded owing to the continued rains. At no time was the water lower than up to their knees. No boats were taken along, so the soldiers swam the various creeks and streams, Men√©ndez taking the lead with a pike in his hand at the very first one they encountered. Those who could not swim were carried across on the pikes. It was extremely fatiguing work, for \\"the rains continued as constant and heavy as if the world was again to be overwhelmed with a flood.\\" Their clothes became soaked and heavy with water, their food as well, the powder wet, and the cords of the arquebuses worthless, and some of the men began to grumble, but Men√©ndez pretended not to hear. The vanguard selected the place for the night encampment, but it was difficult to find high ground on account of the flood. During their halts fires were built, but when within a day's march of Fort Caroline, even this was forbidden, for fear it would betray their approach to the enemy. Five hundred Spanish soldiers marched four days through marsh, forest tangle, fierce winds, and heavy rainfall to an encampment near Fort Caroline. This is where Men√©ndez and his men camped, exhausted and weary, the night before the attack on and capture of the fort. Thus the Spaniards pushed on for two days through the woods, streams, and swamps, without a trail to follow. On the evening of the third day, September 19, Men√©ndez reached the neighborhood of the fort. The night was stormy and the rain fell so heavily that he thought he could approach it without being discovered, and encamped for the night in the pine grove on the edge of a pond within less than a quarter of a league from it. The spot he had chosen was marshy; in places the water stood up to the belts of the soldiers, and no fire could be lighted for fear of revealing their presence to the French. Inside Fort Caroline, La Vigne was keeping watch with his company, but taking pity on his sentinels, wet and fatigued with the heavy rain, he let them leave their stations with the approach of day, and finally he himself retired to his own quarters.Bennett 2001, p. 37 With the break of day on September 20, the feast of St. Matthew, Men√©ndez was already alert. Before dawn he held a consultation with his captains, after which the entire party knelt down and prayed for a victory over their enemies. Then he set out for the fort over the narrow path which led to it from the woods. A French prisoner, Jean Francois, led the way, his hands bound behind him, and the end of the rope held by Men√©ndez himself. In the darkness the Spaniards soon lost the path in crossing a marsh with water up to their knees, and were compelled to wait until daybreak in order to find the way again. When morning came, Men√©ndez set out in the direction of the fort, and on reaching a slight elevation Jean announced that Fort Caroline lay just beyond, down on the river's edge. Then the camp master, Pedro Valdez y Men√©ndez, son-in-law of Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, and the Asturian, Ochoa, went forward to reconnoitre.Manucy 1983, p. 40 They were hailed by a man they took to be a sentinel. \\"Who goes there?\\" he cried. \\"Frenchmen,\\" they answered, and, closing upon him, Ochoa struck him in the face with his knife, which he had not unsheathed. The Frenchman warded off the blow with his sword, but in stepping back to avoid a thrust from Valdez he tripped, fell backwards, and began shouting. Then Ochoa stabbed him and killed him. Men√©ndez, hearing the shouting, thought that Valdez and Ochoa were being slain, and cried out \\"Santiago, at them! God is helping! Victory! the French are killed! The camp master is inside the fort and has taken it,\\" and the entire force rushed down the path. On the way two Frenchmen whom they met were killed. Some of the Frenchmen living in the outbuildings set up a shout on seeing two of their number killed, at which a man within the fort opened the wicket of the main entrance to admit the fugitives. The camp master closed with him and killed him, and the Spaniards poured into the enclosure. Laudonni√®re's trumpeter had just mounted the rampart, and seeing the Spaniards coming towards him sounded the alarm. The French‚Äîmost of whom were still asleep in their beds‚Äîtaken entirely by surprise, came running out of their quarters into the driving rain, some half-dressed, and others quite naked. Among the first was Laudonni√®re, who rushed out of his quarters in his shirt, his sword and shield in his hands, and began to call his soldiers together. But the enemy had been too quick for them, and the wet and muddy courtyard was soon covered with the blood of the French cut down by the Spanish soldiers, who now filled it. At Laudonni√®re's call, some of his men had hastened to the breach on the south side, where lay the ammunition and the artillery. But they were met by a party of Spaniards who repulsed and killed them, and who finally raised their standards in triumph upon the walls. Another party of Spaniards entered by a similar breach on the west, overwhelming the soldiers who attempted to resist them there, and also planted their ensigns on the rampart. Timucua warriors with weapons and tattoo regalia, drawn by Jacques Le Moyne, c. 1562 Jacques le Moyne, the artist, still lame in one leg from a wound he had received in the campaign against the Timucua chief Outina, was roused from his sleep by the outcries and sound of blows proceeding from the courtyard. Seeing that it had been turned into a slaughter pen by the Spaniards who now held it, he fled at once, passing over the dead bodies of five or six of his fellow-soldiers, leaped down into the ditch, and escaped into the neighboring wood. Men√©ndez had remained outside urging his troops on to the attack, but when he saw a sufficient number of them advance, he ran to the front, shouting out that under pain of death no women were to be killed, nor any boys less than fifteen years of age. Men√©ndez had headed the attack on the south-west breach, and after repulsing its defenders, he came upon Laudonni√®re, who was running to their assistance. Jean Francois, the renegade Frenchman, pointed him out to the Spaniards, and their pikemen drove him back into the court. Seeing that the place was lost, and unable to stand up alone against his aggressors, Laudonni√®re turned to escape through his house. The Spaniards pursued him, but he escaped by the western breach. Meanwhile, the trumpeters were announcing a victory from their stations on the ramparts beside the flags. At this the Frenchmen who remained alive entirely lost heart, and while the main body of the Spaniards were going through the quarters, killing the old, the sick, and the infirm, quite a number of the French succeeded in getting over the palisade and escaping. Some of the fugitives made their way into the forest. Jacques Ribault with his ship the Pearl, and another vessel with a cargo of wine and supplies, were anchored in the river but a very short distance from the fort and rescued others who rowed out in a couple of boats; and some even swam the distance to the ships. By this time the fort was virtually won, and Men√©ndez turned his attention to the vessels anchored in the neighborhood. A number of women and children had been spared and his thoughts turned to how he could rid himself of them. His decision was promptly reached. A trumpeter with a flag of truce was sent to summon someone to come ashore from the ships to treat of conditions of surrender. Receiving no response, he sent Jean Francois to the Pearl with the proposal that the French should have a safe-conduct to return to France with the women and children in any one vessel they should select, provided they would surrender their remaining ships and all of their armament. But Jacques Ribault would listen to no such terms, and on his refusal, Men√©ndez turned the guns of the captured fort against Ribault and succeeded in sinking one of the vessels in shallow water, where it could be recovered without damage to the cargo. Jacques Ribault received the crew of the sinking ship into the Pearl, and then dropped a league down the river to where stood two more of the ships which had arrived from France, and which had not even been unloaded. Hearing from the carpenter, Jean de Hais, who had escaped in a small boat, of the taking of the fort, Jacques Ribault decided to remain a little longer in the river to see if he might save any of his compatriots. Sir John Hawkins So successful had been the attack that the victory was won within an hour without loss to the Spaniards of a single man, and only one was wounded. Of the two hundred and forty French in the fort, one hundred and thirty-two were killed outright, including the two English hostages left by Hawkins. About half a dozen drummers and trumpeters were held as prisoners, of which number was Jean Memyn, who later wrote a short account of his experiences; fifty women and children were captured, and the balance of the garrison got away. In a work written in France some seven years later, and first published in 1586, it is related that Men√©ndez hanged some of his prisoners on trees and placed above them the Spanish inscription, \\"I do this not to Frenchmen, but to Lutherans.\\" The story found ready acceptance among the French of that period, and was believed and repeated subsequently by historians, both native and foreign, but it is unsupported by the testimony of a single eyewitness. Throughout the attack the storm had continued and the rain had poured down, so that it was no small comfort to the weary soldiers when Jean Francois pointed out to them the storehouse, where they all obtained dry clothes, and where a ration of bread and wine with lard and pork was served out to each of them. Most of the food stores were looted by the soldiers. Men√©ndez found five or six thousand ducats' worth of silver, largely ore, part of it brought by the Indians from the Appalachian Mountains, and part collected by Laudonni√®re from Outina, from whom he had also obtained some gold and pearls. Most of the artillery and ammunition brought over by Ribault had not been landed, and as Laudonni√®re had traded his with Hawkins for the ship, little was captured. Men√©ndez further captured eight ships, one of which was a galley in the dockyard; of the remaining seven, five were French, including the vessel sunk in the attack, the other two were those captured off Yaguana, whose cargoes of hides and sugar Hawkins had taken with him. In the afternoon Men√©ndez assembled his captains, and after pointing out how grateful they should be to God for the victory, called the roll of his men, and found only four hundred present, many having already started on their way back to St. Augustine. Men√©ndez wanted to return at once, anticipating a descent of the French fleet upon his settlement there. He also wished to attempt the capture of Jacques Ribault's ships before they left the St. Johns, and to get ready a vessel to transport the women and children of the French to Santo Domingo, and from there to Seville. He appointed Gonzalo de Villarroel harbormaster and governor of the district and put the fort, which he had named San Mateo, under his supervision, having captured it on the feast of St. Matthew. The camp master, Valdez, who had proved his courage in the attack, and a garrison of three hundred men were left to defend the fort; the arms of France were torn down from over the main entrance and replaced by the Spanish royal arms surmounted by a cross. The device was painted by two Flemish soldiers in his detachment. Then two crosses were erected inside the fort, and a location was selected for a church to be dedicated to St. Matthew. When Men√©ndez looked about for an escort he found his soldiers so exhausted with the wet march, the sleepless nights, and the battle, that not a man was found willing to accompany him. He therefore determined to remain overnight and then to proceed to St. Augustine in advance of the main body of his men with a picked company of thirty-five of those who were least fatigued. =Laudonnaire's escape from Fort Caroline= The fate of the French fugitives from Fort Caroline was various and eventful. When Laudonni√®re reached the forest, he found there a party of men who had escaped like himself, and three or four of whom were badly wounded. A consultation was held as to what steps should be taken, for it was impossible to remain where they were for any length of time, without food, and exposed at every moment to an attack from the Spaniards. Some of the party determined to take refuge among the natives, and set out for a neighboring Indian village. These were subsequently ransomed by Men√©ndez and returned by him to France. Laudonni√®re then pushed on through the woods, where his party was increased the following day by that of the artist, Jacques Le Moyne. Wandering along one of the forest paths with which he was familiar, Le Moyne had come upon four other fugitives like himself. After consultation together the party broke up, Le Moyne going in the direction of the sea to find Ribault's boats, and the others making for an Indian settlement. Le Moyne finally, while still in the forest, came upon the party of Laudonni√®re. Laudonni√®re had taken the direction of the sea in the evident hope of finding the vessels Ribault had sent inside the bar. After a while the marshes were reached, \\"Where,\\" he wrote, \\"being able to go no farther by reason of my sicknesse which I had, I sent two of my men which were with me, which could swim well, unto the ships to advertise them of that which had happened, and to send them word to come and helpe me. They were not able that day to get unto the ships to certifie them thereof: so I was constrained to stand in the water up to the shoulders all of that night long, with one of my men which would never forsake me.\\"QuinnQuinn 1979, p.359 Then came the old carpenter, Le Challeux, with another party of refugees, through the water and the tall grass. Le Challeux and six others of the company decided to make their way to the coast in the hope of being rescued by the ships which had remained below in the river. They passed the night in a grove of trees in view of the sea, and the following morning, as they were struggling through a large swamp, they observed some men half hidden by the vegetation, whom they took to be a party of Spaniards come down to cut them off. But closer observation showed that they were naked, and terrified like themselves, and when they recognized their leader, Laudonni√®re, and others of their companions, they joined them. The entire company now consisted of twenty-six. Two men were sent to the top of the highest trees from which they discovered one of the smaller of the French ships, that of Captain Maillard, which presently sent a boat to their rescue.Caruso 1963, p.98 The boat next went to the relief of Laudonni√®re, who was so sick and weak that he had to be carried to it. Before returning to the ship, the remainder of the company were gathered up, the men, exhausted with hunger, anxiety, and fatigue, having to be assisted into the boat by the sailors. A consultation was now held between Jacques Ribault and Captain Maillard, and the decision was reached to return to France. But in their weakened state, with their arms and supplies gone and the better part of their crews absent with Jean Ribault, the escaped Frenchmen were unable to navigate all three of the vessels; they therefore selected the two best and sank the other. The armament of the vessel bought from Hawkins was divided between the two captains and the ship was then abandoned. On Thursday, September 25, the two ships set sail for France, but parted company the following day. Jacques Ribault with Le Challeux and his party, after an adventure on the way with a Spanish vessel, ultimately reached La Rochelle. The other vessel, with Laudonni√®re aboard, was driven by foul weather into Swansea Bay in South Wales,Laudonni√®reLawson 1992, p. viii where he again fell very ill. Part of his men he sent to France with the boat. With the remainder he went to London, where he saw Monsieur de Foix, the French ambassador, and from there he proceeded to Paris. Finding that the King had gone to Moulins, he finally set out for it with part of his company to make his report, and reached there about the middle of March of the following year. =The fate of Ribault's fleet= The morning after the capture of Fort Caroline, Men√©ndez set out on his return to St. Augustine. But he first sent the camp master with a party of fifty men to look for those who had escaped over the palisade, and to reconnoitre the French vessels which were still lying in the river, and whom he suspected of remaining there in order to rescue their compatriots. Twenty fugitives were found in the woods, where they were all shot and killed; that evening the camp master returned to Fort Caroline, having found no more Frenchmen. Sabal palmettos grow to high, with exceptional individuals up to The return to St. Augustine proved even more arduous and dangerous than the journey out. The Spaniards crossed the deeper and larger streams on the trunks of trees which they felled for makeshift bridges. A tall palmetto was climbed, and the trail by which they had come was found. They encamped that night on a bit of dry ground, where a fire was built to dry their soaking garments, but the heavy rain began again. On September 19, three days after Men√©ndez had departed from St. Augustine and was encamped with his troops near Fort Caroline, a force of twenty men was sent to his relief with supplies of bread and wine and cheese, but the settlement remained without further news of him. On Saturday some fishermen went down to the beach to cast their nets, where they discovered a man whom they seized and conducted to the fort. He proved to be a member of the crew of one of Jean Ribault's four ships and was in terror of being hung. But the chaplain examined him, and finding that he was \\"a Christian,\\" of which he gave evidence by reciting the prayers, he was promised his life if he told the truth. His story was that in the storm that arose after the French maneuvers in front of St. Augustine, their frigate had been cast away at the mouth of a river four leagues to the south and five of the crew were drowned. The next morning the survivors had been set upon by the natives and three more had been killed with clubs. Then he and a companion had fled along the shore, walking in the sea with only their heads above the water in order to escape detection by the Indians. Bartolom√© Men√©ndez sent at once a party to float the frigate off and bring it up to St. Augustine. But when the Spaniards approached the scene of the wreck, the Indians, who had already slaughtered the balance of the crew, drove them away. A second attempt proved more successful and the vessel was brought up to St. Augustine. The continued absence of news from the expedition against Fort Caroline greatly concerned the Spaniards at St. Augustine. San Vicente, one of the captains who had remained behind, prophesied that Men√©ndez would never come back, and that the entire party would be killed. This impression was confirmed by the return of a hundred men made desperate by the hardships of the march, who brought with them their version of the difficulty of the attempt. On the afternoon of Monday, the 24th, just after the successful rescue of the French frigate, the settlers saw a man coming towards them, shouting at the top of his lungs. The chaplain went out to meet him, and the man threw his arms around him, crying, \\"Victory, victory! the harbor of the French is ours!\\" On reaching St. Augustine, Men√©ndez at once armed two boats to send to the mouth of the St. Johns after Jacques Ribault, to prevent his reuniting with his father or returning to France with the news of the Spanish attack; but, learning that Jacques had already sailed, he abandoned his plan and dispatched a single vessel with supplies to Fort San Mateo. =Massacre at Matanzas Inlet= The massacre of the French Huguenots took place at Matanzas Inlet, which in the 16th century was located several hundred yards north of its present location. On September 28 some Indians brought to the settlement the information that a number of Frenchmen had been cast ashore on an island six leagues from St. Augustine, where they were trapped by the river, which they could not cross. They proved to be the crews of two more of the French fleet which had left Fort Caroline on September 10. Failing to find the Spaniards at sea, Ribault had not dared to land and attack St. Augustine, and so had resolved to return to Fort Caroline, when his vessels were caught in the same storm previously mentioned, the ships dispersed, and two of them wrecked along the shore between Matanzas and Mosquito Inlet. Part of the crews had been drowned in attempting to land, the Indians had captured fifty of them alive and had killed others, so that out of four hundred there remained only one hundred and forty. Following along the shore in the direction of Fort Caroline, the easiest and most natural course to pursue, the survivors had soon found their further advance barred by the inlet, and by the lagoon or \\"river\\" to the west of them. On receipt of this news Men√©ndez sent Diego Flores in advance with forty soldiers to reconnoitre the French position; he himself with the chaplain, some officers, and twenty soldiers rejoined Flores at about midnight, and pushed forward to the side of the inlet opposite their encampment. The following morning, having concealed his men in the thicket, Men√©ndez dressed himself in a French costume with a cape over his shoulder, and, carrying a short lance in his hand, went out and showed himself on the river-bank, accompanied by one of his French prisoners, in order to convince the castaways by his boldness that he was well supported. The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam over to where he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards. \\"I answered him that we had taken their fort and killed all the people in it,\\" wrote Men√©ndez to the King, \\"because they had built it there without Your Majesty's permission, and were disseminating the Lutheran religion in these, Your Majesty's provinces. And that I, as Captain-General of these provinces, was waging a war of fire and blood against all who came to settle these parts and plant in them their evil Lutheran sect; for I was come at Your Majesty's command to plant the Gospel in these parts to enlighten the natives in those things which the Holy Mother Church of Rome teaches and believes, for the salvation of their souls. For this reason I would not grant them a safe passage, but would sooner follow them by sea and land until I had taken their lives.\\" The Frenchman returned to his companions and related his interview. A party of five, consisting of four gentlemen and a captain, was next sent over to find what terms they could get from Men√©ndez, who received them as before, with his soldiers still in ambush, and himself attended by only ten persons. After he had convinced them of the capture of Fort Caroline by showing them some of the spoil he had taken, and some prisoners he had spared, the spokesman of the company asked for a ship and sailors with which to return to France. Men√©ndez replied that he would willingly have given them one had they been Catholics, and had he any vessels left; but that his own ships had sailed with artillery for Fort San Mateo and with the captured women and children for Santo Domingo, and a third was retained to carry dispatches to Spain. Neither would he yield to a request that their lives be spared until the arrival of a ship that could carry them back to their country. To all of their requests he replied with a demand to surrender their arms and place themselves at his mercy, so that he could do \\"as Our Lord may command me.\\" The gentlemen carried back to their comrades the terms he had proposed, and two hours later Ribault's lieutenant returned and offered to surrender their arms and to give him five thousand ducats if he would spare their lives. Men√©ndez replied that the sum was large enough for a poor soldier such as he, but when generosity and mercy were to be shown they should be actuated by no such self-interest. Again the envoy returned to his companions, and in half an hour came their acceptance of the ambiguous conditions. Both of his biographers give a much more detailed account of the occurrence, evidently taken from a common source. The Frenchmen first sent over in a boat their banners, their arquebuses and pistols, swords and targets, and some helmets and breast-pieces. Then twenty Spaniards crossed in the boat and brought the now unarmed Frenchmen over the lagoon in parties of ten. They were subjected to no ill-treatment as they were ferried over, the Spaniards not wishing to arouse any suspicions among those who had not yet crossed. Men√©ndez himself withdrew some distance from the shore to the rear of a sand dune, where he was concealed from the view of the prisoners who were crossing in the boat. In companies of ten the Frenchmen were conducted to him behind the sand dune and out of sight of their companions, and to each party he addressed the same ominous request: \\"Gentlemen, I have but a few soldiers with me, and you are many, and it would be an easy matter for you to overpower us and avenge yourselves upon us for your people which we killed in the fort; for this reason it is necessary that you should march to my camp four leagues from here with your hands tied behind your backs.\\"Norman 1968, pp. 153‚Äì154 The Frenchmen consented, for they were now unarmed and could offer no further resistance, as their hands were bound behind them with cords of the arquebuses and with the matches of the soldiers, probably taken from the very arms they had surrendered. Then Mendoza, the chaplain, asked Men√©ndez to spare the lives of those who should prove to be \\"Christians.\\" Ten Roman Catholics were found, who, but for the intercession of the priest, would have been killed along with the heretics. These were sent by boat to St Augustine. The remainder confessed that they were Protestants. They were given something to eat and drink, and then ordered to set out on the march. On September 29, 1565, the orders of Men√©ndez to kill the Huguenots were executed. At the distance of a gun-shot from the dune behind which these preparations were in progress, Men√©ndez had drawn a line in the sand with his spear, across the path they were to follow. Then he ordered the captain of the vanguard which escorted the prisoners that on reaching the place indicated by the line he was to cut off the heads of all of them; he also commanded the captain of the rearguard to do the same. It was Saturday, September 29, the feast of St. Michael; the sun had already set when the Frenchmen reached the mark drawn in the sand near the banks of the lagoon, and the orders of the Spanish admiral were executed. That same night Men√©ndez returned to St. Augustine, which he reached at dawn. On October 10 the news reached the garrison at St. Augustine that eight days after its capture Fort San Mateo had burned down, with the loss of all the provisions which were stored there. It was accidentally set on fire by the candle of a mulatto servant of one of the captains. Men√©ndez promptly sent food from his own store to San Mateo. Within an hour of receiving this alarming report some Indians brought word that Jean Ribault with two hundred men was in the neighborhood of the place where the two French ships had been wrecked. They were said to be suffering greatly, for the Trinity had broken to pieces farther down the shore, and their provisions had all been lost. They had been reduced to living on roots and grasses and to drinking the impure water collected in the holes and pools along their route. Like the first party, their only hope lay in a return to Fort Caroline. Le Challeux wrote that they had saved a small boat from the wreck; this they caulked with their shirts, and thirteen of the company had set out for Fort Caroline in search of assistance, and had not returned. As Ribault and his companions made their way northward in the direction of the fort, they eventually found themselves in the same predicament as the previous party, cut off by Matanzas Inlet and river from the mainland, and unable to cross. On receipt of the news Men√©ndez repeated the tactics of his previous exploit, and sent a party of soldiers by land, following himself the same day in two boats with additional troops, one hundred and fifty in all. He reached his destination on the shore of the Matanzas River at night, and the following morning, October 11, discovered the French across the water where they had constructed a raft with which to attempt a crossing. At the sight of the Spaniards, the French displayed their banners, sounded their fifes and drums, and offered them battle, but Men√©ndez took no notice of the demonstration. Commanding his own men, whom he had again disposed to produce an impression of numbers, to sit down and take breakfast, he turned to walk up and down the shore with two of his captains in full sight of the French. Then Ribault called a halt, sounded a trumpet-call, and displayed a white flag, to which Men√©ndez replied in the same fashion. The Spaniards having refused to cross at the invitation of Ribault, a French sailor swam over to them, and came back immediately in an Indian canoe, bringing the request that Ribault send over someone authorized to state what he wanted. Map of the northeast coast of present-day Florida showing the locations of Fort Caroline and Matanzas Inlet The sailor returned again with a French gentleman, who announced that he was Sergeant Major of Jean Ribault, Viceroy and Captain General of Florida for the King of France. His commander had been wrecked on the coast with three hundred and fifty of his people, and had sent to ask for boats with which to reach his fort, and to inquire if they were Spaniards, and who was their captain. \\"We are Spaniards,\\" answered Men√©ndez. \\"I to whom you are speaking am the Captain, and my name is Pedro Men√©ndez. Tell your General that I have captured your fort, and killed your French there, as well as those who had escaped from the wreck of your fleet.\\" Then he offered Ribault the identical terms which he had extended to the first party and led the French officer to where, a few rods beyond, lay the dead bodies of the shipwrecked and defenseless men he had massacred twelve days before. When the Frenchman viewed the heaped-up corpses of his familiars and friends, he asked Men√©ndez to send a gentleman to Ribault to inform him of what had occurred; and he even requested Men√©ndez to go in person to treat about securities, as the Captain-General was fatigued. Men√©ndez told him to tell Ribault that he gave his word that he could come in safety with five or six of his companions. In the afternoon Ribault crossed over with eight gentlemen and was entertained by Men√©ndez. The French accepted some wine and preserves; but would not take more, knowing the fate of their companions. Then Ribault, pointing to the bodies of his comrades, which were visible from where he stood, said that they might have been tricked into the belief that Fort Caroline was taken, referring to a story he had heard from a barber who had survived the first massacre by feigning death when he was struck down, and had then escaped. But Ribault was soon convinced of his mistake, for he was allowed to converse privately with two Frenchmen captured at Fort Caroline. Then he turned to Men√©ndez and asked again for ships with which to return to France. The Spaniard was unyielding, and Ribault returned to his companions to acquaint them with the results of the interview. Within three hours he was back again. Some of his people were willing to trust to the mercy of Men√©ndez, he said, but others were not, and he offered one hundred thousand ducats on the part of his companions to secure their lives; but Men√©ndez stood firm in his determination. As the evening was falling Ribault again withdrew across the lagoon, saying he would bring the final decision in the morning. Between the alternatives of death by starvation or at the hands of the Spaniards, the night brought no better counsel to the castaways than that of trusting to the Spaniards' mercy. When morning came Ribault returned with six of his captains, and surrendered his own person and arms, the royal standard which he bore, and his seal of office. His captains did the same, and Ribault declared that about seventy of his people were willing to submit, among whom were many noblemen, gentlemen of high connections, and four Germans. The remainder of the company had withdrawn and had even attempted to kill their leader. Then the same actions were performed as on the previous occasion. Diego Flores de Valdes ferried the Frenchmen over in parties of ten, which were successively conducted behind the same sand hill, where their hands were tied behind them. The same excuse was made that they could not be trusted to march unbound to the camp. When the hands of all had been bound except those of Ribault, who was for a time left free, the ominous question was put: \\"Are you Catholics or Lutherans, and are there any who wish to confess?\\" Ribault answered that they were all of the new Protestant religion. Men√©ndez pardoned the drummers, fifers, trumpeters, and four others who said they were Catholics, some seventeen in all. Then he ordered that the remainder should be marched in the same order to the same line in the sand, where they were in turn massacred. Men√©ndez had turned over Ribault to his brother-in-law, and biographer, Gonzalo Sol√≠s de Mer√°s, and to San Vicente, with directions to kill him. Ribault was wearing a felt hat and on Vicente's asking for it Ribault gave it to him. Then the Spaniard said: \\"You know how captains must obey their generals and execute their commands. We must bind your hands.\\" When this had been done and the three had proceeded a little distance along the way, Vicente gave him a blow in the stomach with his dagger, and Mer√°s thrust him through the breast with a pike which he carried, and then they cut off his head.Norman 1968, p. 155 \\"I put Jean Ribault and all the rest of them to the knife,\\" Men√©ndez wrote Philip four days later,\\"judging it to be necessary to the service of the Lord Our God, and of Your Majesty. And I think it a very great fortune that this man be dead; for the King of France could accomplish more with him and fifty thousand ducats, than with other men and five hundred thousand ducats; and he could do more in one year, than another in ten; for he was the most experienced sailor and corsair known, very skillful in this navigation of the Indies and of the Florida Coast.\\" That same night Men√©ndez returned to St. Augustine; and when the event became known, there were some, even in that isolated garrison, living in constant dread of a descent by the French, who considered him cruel, an opinion which his brother-in-law, Mer√°s, the very man who helped to kill Ribault, did not hesitate to record. And when the news eventually reached Spain, even there a vague rumor was afloat that there were those who condemned Men√©ndez for perpetrating the massacre against his given word. Others among the settlers thought that he had acted as a good captain, because, with their small store of provisions, they considered that there would have been an imminent danger of their perishing by hunger had their numbers been increased by the Frenchmen, even had they been Catholics. Bartolom√© Barrientos, Professor at the University of Salamanca, whose history was completed two years after the event, expressed still another phase of Spanish contemporary opinion: \\"He acted as an excellent inquisitor; for when asked if they were Catholics or Lutherans, they dared to proclaim themselves publicly as Lutherans, without fear of God or shame before men; and thus he gave them that death which their insolence deserved. And even in that he was very merciful in granting them a noble and honourable death, by cutting off their heads, when he could legally have burnt them alive.\\" The motives which impelled Men√©ndez to commit these deeds of blood should not be attributed exclusively to religious fanaticism, or to racial hatred. The position subsequently taken by the Spanish Government in its relations with France to justify the massacre turned on the large number of the French and the fewness of the Spaniards; the scarcity of provisions, and the absence of ships with which to transport them as prisoners. These reasons do not appear in the brief accounts contained in Men√©ndez's letter of October 15, 1565, but some of them are explicitly stated by Barrientos. It is probable that Men√©ndez clearly perceived the risk he would run in granting the Frenchmen their lives and in retaining so large a body of prisoners in the midst of his colonists; that it would be a severe strain upon his supply of provisions and seriously hamper the dividing up of his troops into small garrisons for the forts which he contemplated erecting at different points along the coast. Heaqdboard and coffin of Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s at Mission of Nombre de Dios in St. Augustine, Florida Philip wrote a comment on the back of a dispatch from Men√©ndez in Havana, of October 12, 1565: \\"As to those he has killed he has done well, and as to those he has saved, they shall be sent to the galleys.\\" In his official utterances in justification of the massacre Philip laid more stress on the contamination which heresy might have brought among the natives than upon the invasion of his dominions. On his return to St. Augustine Men√©ndez wrote to the King a somewhat cursory account of the preceding events and summarized the results in the following language: \\"The other people with Ribault, some seventy or eighty in all, took to the forest, refusing to surrender unless I grant them their lives. These and twenty others who escaped from the fort, and fifty who were captured by the Indians, from the ships which were wrecked, in all one hundred and fifty persons, rather less than more, are [all] the French alive to-day in Florida, dispersed and flying through the forest, and captive with the Indians. And since they are Lutherans and in order that so evil a sect shall not remain alive in these parts, I will conduct myself in such wise, and will so incite my friends, the Indians, on their part, that in five or six weeks very few if any will remain alive. And of a thousand French with an armada of twelve sail who had landed when I reached these provinces, only two vessels have escaped, and those very miserable ones, with some forty or fifty persons in them.\\" See also *Spanish Florida References * This article incorporates text from a publication The American Magazine, Volume 19, 1885, pp. 682-683, Fort Marion, at St. Augustine‚ÄîIts History and Romance by M.

The school is located at 18A Bryants Crescent, May Pen, Clarendon and has been there for over 30 years. It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.\\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average ‚Äì across all demographics.\\" History It is the philosophy of the Seventh-day Adventist Church that church schools should be established in many areas to educate the children of its members. It was this dream that drove Mrs. Lucille Christian-Bennett, the late Ms. Amy Stevenson and Mr. McIntyre and a few others to give birth to the May Pen Seventh Day Adventist church school in January 1954. The school's first classrooms were in the church building which was situated at the corner of Manchester Avenue and Church Street in May Pen. The records showed that on the first day of school, there was only one student who met with Mrs. H. Butler who was the principal. The growth was steady, if not rapid, and so in 1958 they had to add the high school section to take care of the students who had completed the elementary division. It was now called May Pen Academy to reflect its new status. Manchester Avenue became too busy and noisy for Sabbath services, and so property was purchased in the quiet \\"bushes\\" at 18a Bryants Crescent to relocate the church and the school came along to share the facilities. Co-existence became difficult for both institutions at this location so the new church building was constructed on Fernleigh Avenue and the school was left to continue its expansion at its present home. Nineteen sixty-three saw the school moving to a higher level of delivery with a larger student body. It was at this time that it had its second name change as May Pen High School came into being. The school went through major changes in the early nineteen eighties. The management was taken over by a group of Seventh Day Adventist members who believed in the education system of the church and the future of the institution. Many other changes took place in the operational structure, financing and an enlightened approach to education. Mission statement The Mission of May Pen High School is to provide all students with the ambience, personnel and equipment in order that they can be educated to acknowledge Christian virtues, respect for tolerance of mankind, the dignity of labour, love of nature and country and an undying thirst for knowledge. It is the aim that all students will become worthwhile contributors to the development of themselves and the whole human race.

She wrote and performed in programs for children on CBC radio and CBC television between 1938 and 1962. Stories broadcast on her radio and television programs Just Mary and Maggie Muggins were published in a series of popular books. Family and education Mary Grannan was born into an Irish Canadian Roman Catholic family in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada on 11 February 1900. She was the second of three daughters born to William Peter Grannan and Catherine Teresa Haney. Her father, a wheelwright by trade, was also employed as a fireman. Mary Grannan attended St. Dunstan's School, a Roman Catholic elementary school, and then Fredericton High School. She attended New Brunswick's Provincial Normal School in Fredericton from September 1917 to June 1918, graduating as a teacher second class. Teacher and broadcaster in Fredericton In 1919 Mary Grannan began teaching Grade 1 at the Devon Superior School in the town of Devon, just across the Saint John River from Fredericton. She spent the rest of her 20-year teaching career at the school, where she was noted for her talents as a storyteller and as an author and producer of plays performed by her students. She took private elocution lessons, and participated in amateur theatre productions in Fredericton. In the summer of 1927 she studied at the Vesper George School of Art in Boston, and later contributed editorial cartoons to the Daily Gleaner, a Fredericton newspaper. In April 1936, while still teaching full-time, Mary Grannan began broadcasting on CFNB, a private radio station in Fredericton. One of her programs, a comedy series entitled Aggravating Agatha, became a popular success in the local market. CFNB attempted to interest the newly formed Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in carrying it nationally, but the Corporation did not accept the proposal. On the other hand, they expressed an interest in increasing children's radio programming, and Mary Grannan developed the idea for her Just Mary program to meet that requirement. The program, in which she read her original children's stories, appeared first on CFNB in November 1937. It was carried on the eastern radio network of the CBC during the summer and the Christmas holiday season of 1938. On the strength of Just Mary she was offered a full-time position as a junior producer at CBC radio headquarters in Toronto. She joined the CBC in Toronto in July 1939, having taken a year's leave of absence from her teaching position, and officially resigned from teaching in 1940. CBC radio and television When she started work at CBC radio in 1939, Mary Grannan was responsible for two weekly children's programs. Just Mary, which was heard from noon to 12:15 on Sundays, was intended for children from four to eight years old. The Children's Scrapbook, a half-hour program directed at older school-aged children, was broadcast on Saturday afternoons beginning at 12:30. It offered a variety of content, including plays, interviews, and documentary broadcasts recorded outside the studio in places such as a zoo or a newspaper's linotype printing operation. The reporter for these documentary segments was Austin Willis, who was the regular announcer on both of Mary Grannan's programs. From fall 1945 to spring of 1946, an evening edition of The Children's Scrapbook, called Evening Scrapbook, appeared on Thursday evenings. The Children's Scrapbook ceased production in the spring of 1946. To replace it, Mary Grannan wrote and produced a new half-hour program called The Land of Supposing. The program, which presented dramatizations of original stories by Mary Grannan, as well as adaptations of fairy tales and folk tales, ran from April through June from 1946 to 1948, and again in 1950. The Maggie Muggins radio program was first broadcast on 1 January 1948 and was heard on Wednesday afternoons. It was based on Mary Grannan's book, also entitled Maggie Muggins, which had been published in 1944. Unlike the Just Mary stories, Maggie Muggins had a continuing cast of characters. By 1949, it had a larger audience than any other Canadian children's program. The radio series ended in June 1953, when the actress who played Maggie graduated from high school. Maggie Muggins became a television program in February 1955. In 1960 Mary Grannan retired, having reached the age of 60, the mandatory retirement age for women at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. She stayed in Toronto and continued to work on her two programs, Just Mary on radio and Maggie Muggins on television, as a freelancer. In April 1962 a new supervisor of children's programming was appointed and both programs were cancelled. Mary Grannan returned to Fredericton and spent the rest of her life there, dying in 1975 of heart failure. The family home, where she lived with her two sisters after retirement, was recognized as a New Brunswick Historic Site in 1999. Children's book author Prompted by fan mail requesting that the Just Mary stories be made available in book form, the CBC collaborated with the Canadian textbook publisher W.J. Gage & Company to produce Mary Grannan's first book. Entitled Just Mary and containing twelve stories, it was published in an edition of 4500 copies in January 1941. The CBC purchased 500 copies at cost for direct sale to the public, with the rest going to bookstores. A second book, Just Mary Again, appeared in late fall 1941, also published by CBC and Gage. Both books sold out quickly and were followed a third, Just Mary Stories: Combining Just Mary and Just Mary Again, which appeared in an edition of 10,000 in 1942. As a salaried CBC employee, Mary Grannan did not receive royalties from the sale of her first three books as the CBC considered that it owned the copyright of the scripts. G.P. Putnam's Sons published a US edition of Just Mary Stories in the fall of 1944. Also in 1944 the Canadian publisher Thomas Allen & Son Limited brought out Maggie Muggins, a collection of stories that had not appeared on the radio program. Both of these publications paid royalties. Between 1943 and 1945, the copyright status of the previously broadcast Just Mary stories was under discussion by lawyers for the CBC, Thomas Allen, and Mary Grannan herself. The outcome was that Mary Grannan retained copyright in her work and received royalties from her subsequent books, which were all published by Thomas Allen in Canada. These included more than 15 titles in the Maggie Muggins series and several collections of Just Mary stories. Mary Grannan's books were Canadian best-sellers during the 1940s and 1950s. The Just Mary titles alone had sold 120,000 copies by 1947, and by 1962 her total sales were approximately 400,000.

He also influenced the decision of the French Parlement of 16 April 1761 in favour of deforestation. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society, 22 April 1762 under the name Francois-Henri, Marquis de Turbilly.De Beer, Gavin Rylands. \\"The relations between Fellows of the Royal Society and French men of science when France and Britain were at war.\\" Notes and records of the Royal Society of London (1952): 244‚Äì299. He initiated two awards for the best and most beautiful wheat and rye harvested in the commune. The awards consist of a sum of money and a medal. It was the first of its kind given in France. Another of his ideas was the establishment of agricultural societies in the country. Another of his ideas was to abolish the practice of begging, on which he succeeded in his lands. De Menon also develops new activities such as the cultivation of hemp; the rearing of silkworms for the production of silk; and a small factory for the production of soap and another unit for the production of terracotta roof tiles. Towards the end of his life he initiated fish farming. His latest project to produce porcelain turned into a legal and financial nightmare. His large enterprises had asked immense capital. Some of its operations did not succeed in the first years, and eventually he got totally ruined. While the creditors were seizing his property, De Menon had turned over his administration just before his death in Paris on 25 February 1776.  Legacy  De Menon had no children. After his death in 1776 his land was sold by the creditors, and the estate was bought by an Irish nobleman. It was visited by the English agronomist Arthur Young in 1787, who had especially travelled from England to Mayenne to investigate the work of De Menon. English farmer found prominent remains of the improvements made during nearly forty years, and he gave an interesting account in first volume of travel reports. Voltaire immortalised de Menon (Marquis of Turbilly) in his Ep√Ætre √† madame Denis sur l'agriculture (Epistle to Madame Denis on agriculture), stating:Guillory, Pierre Constant, et al.

After returning to private practice during the Second French Empire he successfully defended Gustave Flaubert in an action against his Madame Bovary. Early years Antoine S√©nard was born in Rouen on 9 April 1800, the son of an architect. He studied at the lyc√©e of Rouen. He qualified as an advocate in Paris, and at the age of 19 was admitted to the bar at Rouen. He performed brilliantly at the court of assizes, and opposed the senior branch on the ordinances of July 1830. However, he soon opposed the government of Louis Philippe of France.

He resigned this position and ran successfully for election on 23 April 1848 to represent Seine-Inf√©rieure in the Constituent Assembly. When disturbances broke out in Rouen he returned, having not yet been replaced as Attorney General, and was able to restore the peace. Up to one hundred insurgents died, and several hundred were arrested. S√©nard returned to Paris and was appointed to the Labor committee. S√©nard was President of the Assembly from 5 to 29 June 1848, replacing Philippe Buchez, who was considered deposed after the disturbances in the Assembly of 15 May 1848. He organized the support of the Assembly for General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac, and was appointed Minister of the Interior on 25 June 1848. In this position he attempted to reorganize the administration. His attempts to make Cavaignac the official candidate in the December 1848 presidential elections caused a cabinet crisis. He resigned on 13 October 1848 and went into opposition when Louis Napoleon was elected President on 10 December 1848. He was not reelected for the Legislative Assembly, and was enrolled in the bar of Paris. Second Empire S√©nard defended Gustave Flaubert and L√©on Laurent-Pichat from charges of damaging public morals by writing and publishing Madame Bovary, and won their acquittal in 1857. Flaubert later dedicated an edition of Madame Bovary to S√©nard. Third Republic After the Franco-Prussian War began, on 4 September 1870 the Government of National Defense sent S√©nard on a mission to Florence to obtain support for France in Italy, and to seek clarification on the separatist movement that seemed to be planned for Nice. He formally congratulated King Victor Emmanuel on the occupation of Rome by Piedmontese troops and the unification of Italy, but did not obtain satisfaction on the question of Nice. S√©nard ran unsuccessfully for election to the National Assembly for the Seine- Inf√©rieure in the elections of 8 February 1871. He was elected mayor of Saint- Cloud in May 1871. On 18 October 1874 he ran for election as representative for the department of Seine-et-Oise, and was elected. He sat on the left. S√©nard did not run for election on 20 February 1876, but was elected on 14 October 1877 for the first district of Pontoise.

History In response to the difficulty of locating material about the experiences and issues relating to women in Australia, Shirley Jones and Lenore Coltheart developed the concept of a women's library. The objectives of the Library are \\"to heighten awareness of women's issues; to preserve documents on women's lives and activities; to support the field of women's history and to highlight women's contribution to this country's development.\\" A committee was established and the Jessie Street Women's Library Association held an inaugural Annual General Meeting in August 1989 The Library's patrons include Jessie Street's son Sir Laurence Street, the Hon Elizabeth Evatt AC, and poets, Judith Wright and Oodgeroo Noonuccal. The Library is currently staffed by volunteers and located in the Ultimo Community Centre, a venue provided by the City of Sydney Council. Exterior view of Jessie Street National Women's Library Interior view of Jessie Street National Women's Library =In memory of Jessie Street= Jessie Street (1889 ‚Äì 1970) fought hard for many years as an advocate for women's rights in Australia. She was a key figure in Australian political life for over 50 years, well known for campaigning for human rights and women's issues. In 1945 at the founding of the United Nations she was the only female Australian delegate. In 1967 she initiated a successful amendment to the Australian constitution to remove discriminatory references to Aborigines. Collections The collections include archives of the papers of Australian women's organisations, the personal papers and letters, diaries and journals of Australian women and also audio recordings of interviews. Many of the books and personal archives in the collection have been donated, including 500 books donated from the estate of feminist Eva Maria and a collection of 110 books by or about Virginia Woolf. In 1993 the former Canberra Women's Archive was donated to the collection. References Further reading * A heritage building for the National Women's Library.

The site is a National Monument in the care of the Gowran Development Association (GDA)Life Through our Viewfinder. Published by Dalton House Gowran 2009 and the Office of Public Works (OPW). The church and its family connections have been of huge importance to Gowran and further afield over the centuries. The church is a collegiate church, which means that the priests or chaplains attached to it lived in community together. The present church was not a monastery or an abbey; however experts believe the church was built on the site of an earlier monastery. The presence of an Ogham stone on the site, which is on display in the chancel, suggests there was a place of worship here dating back 2000 years to Celtic times or beyond. The Collegiate Church In 1312 A.D. Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick and Lord Deputy of Ireland made a binding agreement before the Kings Justice in Dublin with the Dean and Chapter of St Canice's Cathedral in Kilkenny to financially support four priests in St. Mary‚Äôs Church Gowran to celebrate masses forever, for himself, his wife Joan, his son, James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormonde, his daughters and his ancestors living and dead.

Published by the Gowran Development Association 1992 History St. Mary‚Äôs Church has undergone many alterations. =Pre-Christian to Medieval period= * 1st/2nd Century: foundation of the Kingdom of Osraige. * 3rd/4th Century: Ogham stone. The presence of this Christianised Ogham stone suggests that this site was a site of worship in pre-Christian times, before St. Patrick arrived in Ireland in 432 A.D. * 455 A.D. St. Patrick visits Gowran and builds churches in the area. Rev. John Francis Shearman on his book Loca Patriciana,Loca Patriciana, an Identifications of Localities Chiefly in Leinster visited by St. Patrick, by the Rev. John Francis Shearman 1879. p.266 published in 1879, detailing the travels of St. Patrick in Leinster and Ossory, makes several references to St. Patrick travelling through Belach Gabhr√°n (Old name for Gowran). Fr. Shearman says the first church was connected with the saint of Gowran, Saint Lochan, whose feast day is 31 December. St. Lochan was a son of Congall, son of Eirce, whose family history is given in Ossorian Geonology. A relation of Eirce is commemorated on the Gowran Ogham Stone. * 1163 There is further evidence of a church on this site before the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Dermot O Ryan, Chief of Idrone, made a grant of land for the foundation of the Cistercian Abbey of Killenny, De Valle Dei (the Valley of God). Killenny is about a mile and a half from Goresbridge on the Mount Loftus ‚Äì Graiguenamanagh road. Laurence O Toole, Archbishop of Dublin, Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster, Donagh Bishop of Leighlin, Felix O Dulaney, Abbot of the Cistersians in Ossory, and many nobles of south Leinster signed the document at Gowran. *1218 Ralph (Radoulfus) was portrieve (priest) of Gowran before 1218. He was influential in the Diocese of Ossory. A monument to commemorate Ralph is on display in the chancel. He is depicted on the monument wearing his priestly vestments. *1225 An early church was built with a square tower in the centre. This is believed to be the only church in Ireland from that period with a tower in the centre. =Medieval period to the 18th century= *1415 Irish enemies surrounded the Church and burned it. *1421 Edward Bruce attacked the town of Gowran and further damaged the Church. The Pope granted Indulgences to those who, for the following ten years, gave alms for the repair and conservation of the Church of St. Mary the Virgin of Ballygowran (old name for Gowran). The height of the old tower was increased by adding the upper stories of the belfry to the tower. The tower was strengthened by building another layer of stone to the base on the north wall, which now slopes outwards at the base. The wall of the old tower and that of the new addition can be seen from the inside of the tower when looking up at the north wall. Buttresses were added to the nave. *15th century: major alterations were carried out. *1502 Margaret Fitzgerald, wife of Sir Piers Butler, decorated the Church. *1541 During the reign of King Henry the eight in England the religious practice in the church changed from Catholic to Reformed, more commonly known as Protestant or, in the case of St. Mary‚Äôs Church, the Church of Ireland. The church was used for worship by the Church of Ireland community until the 1970s. *1646 Kealy Mortuary Chapel built. *1700 The second half of the 1700s saw a period of decline in the built heritage of Ireland, with many of the landlords becoming absentee landlords and the aristocracy moving to England. Gowran Castle (the second castle, which was built in 1713; the first castle was built by James Butler third Earl of Ormonde in 1385. This James Butler is buried in St. Mary‚Äôs Church), which close to the church, also fell into dereliction. A 1791 picture of the church from the book Grose‚Äôs Antiquities of Ireland shows the south wall of the nave still standing but in disrepair, with heavy growth of ivy covering the walls. =19th century to present= *19th century: From the start of 1800s, this decline was reversed. The century saw the start of major improvements to the built heritage of Gowran. Many new houses in the town, like the Shamrock Cottages and Dovers Row, were built. *1816-1819 A new Gowran Castle was built. *1826 A new Chancel was rebuilt in St Mary‚Äôs Church to the designs of the Kilkenny architect of the period William Robertson who also designed the nearby Gowran Castle and most of the standing Kilkenny Castle we see today. *1850s The coming of the railway to Gowran and the construction of railway buildings were significant events in the area. *1881 George Ashlin modelled his plan for the Catholic Church of the Assumption Gowran on the nave of St. Mary‚Äôs Church. The Roman Catholic Church was built and in 1881 dedicated by Dr. Moran Bishop of Ossory, who had Gowran connections. *1900 A new school was built. *1960s The upper floor of the tower and the wall surrounding the top of the tower were reinstated. *1970s Church of Ireland worship finishes. Use of the church for service ended in the 1970s, bringing to an end over 700 years of worship in the church. The church was taken over by the OPW. A bust of James Agar and a holy water font, known as the Gowran Holy Water Font, which were in the church before it closed, were taken to St. Laserian‚Äôs Church in Old Leighlin, Co. Carlow, Ireland. *1988 The Gowran Development Association was founded. One of its aims was to enhance and develop St. Mary‚Äôs Church and surrounds. *1992-1995 Restoration of the boundary wall surrounding the graveyard was completed by the Gowran Development Association with support from the Fas (now Intreo) community employment scheme (CE scheme). *1995 Restoration of the chancel roof and stabilisation of the timber structure, which began in 1994, was completed. Stained glass windows were storm glazed. Representation was made by the Gowran Development Association to government ministers with a view to providing funding to the OPW for further improvements. Following these meetings the government committed a further ¬£300,000 for improvement works on the church. Following stabilisation work on the roof, the interior of the chancel was renovated. The interior walls of the chancel were replastered in the traditional style using lime mortar and goat hair. Cracks in the tower were monitored and the tower found to be stable. Some of the monuments were rearranged in the chancel to make the building suitable for visitors. A number of monuments were brought in from the nave and positioned in the chancel to prevent weather erosion. *1996 The Upper Garden and Millennium Garden between the boundary wall to the front of the church and the main street were built by the Gowran Development Association with support from the CE scheme, Barrow Nore Sure Leader, (now Kilkenny Leader Partnership or KLP), and Kilkenny Co. Council under the Village Renewal Scheme. *2000 Flood lighting was installed around the building. *2010-2012 of the wall to the rear of the graveyard was restored by the OPW using traditional skills and lime mortar mix. Parts of this wall are medieval. The wall was part of a wall surrounding the walled town of Gowran. *2013 Restoration work began on the nearby Gowran Castle. Oldest inscribed burial monument The effigy of Ralph (Radoulfus) in his priestly vestments, the portrieve (priest) of Gowran in 1218, is believed to be the oldest burial monument in Ireland with a date on it. The inscription is carved in Latin around the edge of the monument in Lombardic lettering. The monument is dated 19 March 1253. Butler of Ormonde connections Gowran was important to the Butlers of Ormond for over 500 years. Following the arrival of the Normans in Ireland in 1169, Gowran and lands surrounding it were granted to Theobald Walter, 1st Chief Butler of Ireland, ancestor of the Butlers. He incorporated the town of Gowran sometime after 1177. He died in 1206. Gowran was the chief seat of the Butlers in Co. Kilkenny until James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond, and also called the Earl of Gowran, bought Kilkenny castle in 1391. Gowran and St. Mary‚Äôs Church were important to the Butlers from the time of Theobald Fitzwalter and his son Theobald Butler. However it was their descendant Edmund Butler, Earl of Carrick, who established the Collegiate Church in Gowran, who first chose to be buried there. He and his brother Thomas went on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. James the Apostle at Santiago de Compostela in Spain in 1321. He died in London on his return on 13 September 1321. He was buried in St. Mary‚Äôs Church on 10 November 1321. Other family names on monuments Agars - following the presence of the Butlers in Gowran for 500 years, the Cromwellian wars in Ireland, and the Cromwellian campaign in Gowran in 1650, Charles Agar came to Gowran from Yorkshire. Charles, his son James, and many of their descendants are buried in St. Mary‚Äôs church and commemorated on various monuments. Other family names include Kealy, Rothe, and Moran.The History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory. Vol 3. Rev. Canon William Carrigan 1905 There are also a memorial stained glass window to the memory of Aubrey Cecil White from Gowran, who was killed in the 1914-18 war in the battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916 aged 20 years, and a monument to James Agar, who died on 30 December 1733. Monuments Single Butler Knight Tomb ‚Äì This is a mensa or table tomb. The single knight tomb was the first tomb carved in Gowran in the period 1500-1515. This tomb is believed to have been carved by the O Tunneys, the great Kilkenny stonemasons of this period. Two Butler Knight ‚Äì also a mensa tomb, it seems to belong to the same period 1515-1527. Agar Monument ‚Äì A large mural monument in classic style with Grecian pillars commemorates James Agar, who died in 1733.

The building was rebuilt and expanded into the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in 2009-2014. Construction The limestone arena was built in 1926 and designed in Spanish Colonial Revival style by Atlee Ayres, his son Robert M. Ayres, and their associates George Willis and Emmett Jackson. In 1929, the American Institute of Architects awarded the architects a gold medal for the arena's design. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Features Initially built to honor America's World War I military dead, the structure is part of the Veterans Memorial Plaza. The white marble War Mothers Memorial honoring the mothers whose sons who fought in World War I was erected at the corner of the arena in 1938 by the San Antonio Chapter No. 2 of American War Mothers.

The 12-sided shape of the arena features carved stone and an arcade entrance complemented by a domed tower on each side. Red stone tile and metal are used on the roof. The original interior featured two-level horseshoe-shaped seating. The design on the asbestos auditorium stage curtain was the painting Founding of San Antonio by artist Hugo D. Pohl. The painting depicted the artist's vision of the 1718 founding of Presidio San Antonio de Bexar, and also included the Battle of the Alamo defenders James Bowie, Davy Crockett, William B. Travis and James Butler Bonham. Restoration At the time of the 1981 NRHP designation, the building stood vacant due a fire that had destroyed much of the interior in 1979 and rendered the asbestos curtain beyond repair. An April 1981 voter bond referendum approved $9.1 million for restoration. The renovated auditorium was rededicated in 1985.

His older brother Michele, was a building engineer, and Michele's son, Giovanni Filippo (died 1770), was an architect. Giovanni Maria trained under his brother-in-law, Pier Dandini. In the Florentine tradition, who gave great weight to prior masters, Giovanni was engaged in making copies of works in the ducal courts of Italy, including travels to Venice, Parma, Modena, Rome, and Naples. Francesco Maria Gabburri said of Giovanni Maria that during his travels to the latter two cities, he did also create works of his own design.

He completed the frescoes in the ceiling of the church of Santa Maria degli Angiolini, Florence, depicting St Michael Archangel in Glory. He also painted two lunettes in the library of the convent of the Annunziata. He painted altarpieces for Santa Maria in Campo; for San Jacopo sopr'Arno, in the latter depicting a Christ appearing to St Anthony Abbot (circa 1709); and for the church of Santa Lucia dei Magnoli, depicting the Martyrdom of the Santa Lucia (circa 1712-15).Encyclopedia Treccani Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 25 (1981); entry on Ciocchi Family by Stella Rudolph. He also frescoed stanza in the Palazzo Mansi of Lucca.Palazzo Mansi of Lucca , now an Art Museum. Late in life, Maria's vision was lost, and he wrote a book which discussed his ideas about art. La Pittura in ParnasoLa pittura in Parnaso; (1725), Stamperia di Michele Nestenus, Florence. Published posthumously in 1725, the work was dedicated to Marquis Neri Guadagni.

The title quotes from a line from Thomas Gray's 1750 poem Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard: \\"The paths of glory lead but to the grave\\". It is held by the Imperial War Museum in London, which describes it as \\"one of Nevinson's most famous paintings\\". Background Nevinson had served as a volunteer ambulance driver with the Friends' Ambulance Service on the Western Front in the early months of the First World War, from November 1914 to January 1915, and then returned to England. He served as an orderly in the Royal Army Medical Corps in London but was invalided out in late 1915 due to rheumatic fever. During this period he painted several paintings such as La Mitrailleuse (1915) and The Doctor (1916). He was commissioned as a war artist in 1917 and was sent to France by the British War Propaganda Bureau. He adopted a Realist style to depict the horror of the war, moved decisively away from his earlier Modernist and Vorticist styles. Painting The painting measures . It depicts two dead British soldiers, face down in a battlefield on the Western Front. They lie unburied in a muddy landscape that is bare save for barriers of barbed wire and the detritus of war. The painting was censored by the official censor of paintings and drawings in France, Lieutenant Colonel A N Lee, on the grounds that displaying dead bodies would hinder the war effort. Nonetheless, Nevinson included the painting in his official exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in March 1918, but the work was displayed with a brown paper strip across the bodies bearing the word \\"censored\\". Nevinson was reprimanded by the War Office for exhibiting a censored image, and for using the word \\"censored\\" in public without authorisation, but obtained significant publicity, particularly as the first exhibition of official colour tinted photographs from the front (including images of actual dead bodies) opened on 4 March. The painting was bought by the Imperial War Museum direct from the exhibition, as the work had been commissioned by the Ministry of Information.

Because of the nuanced definitions of spirituality and religiosity, the literature on spirituality is not consistent in definitions or measures resulting in a lack of coherence. However, taken as a whole, research tends to show that the effect of spirituality is positive, associated with better health outcomes.Douglas, Amber N., Sherlyn Jimenez, Hsiu-Ju Lin, and Linda K. Frisman. \\"Ethnic Differences in the Effects of Spiritual Well-Being on Long- Term Psychological and Behavioral Outcomes Within a Sample of Homeless Women.\\" Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 14(2008):344-352. For those who engage in spirituality, it may serve as a buffer from negative life events, often moderating the relationship between negative life experiences and levels of anxiety or depression.Young, J. Scott, Craig S. Cashwell, and Julia Shcherbakova. \\"The Moderating Relationship of Spirituality on Negative Life Events and Psychological Adjustment.\\" Counseling and Values 45(2000):49-55. The exception is when negative spiritual coping is practiced. This type of coping has negative health implications. The homeless are a vulnerable population that experiences the moderating effect of spirituality; spirituality plays a role in their emotional and mental capacity to handle challenges they face and practice health-promoting behaviors. For the homeless who practice spirituality as a positive coping mechanism, it often improves their life and is cited as a source of strength and comfort in qualitative research. Spirituality =Definition= Spirituality does not have a clear definition, though it is generally regarded as the search for and experience of the sacred, meaning God, a higher power, or something of divine nature.Hodge, David R., Stephanie E. Moser, and Michael S. Shafer. ‚ÄúSpirituality and Mental Health Among Homeless Mothers.‚Äù Social Work Research 36(2012):1-12.George, Linda K., David B. Larson, Harold G. Koenig, and Michael E. Mccullough. \\"Spirituality and Health: What We Know, What We Need to Know.\\" Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology 19(2000):102-116. Spirituality is characterized as something experienced personally, an individualized process that involves personal or private beliefs.Brush, Barbara L., and Eileen M. McGee. ‚ÄúEvaluating the Spiritual Perspectives of Homeless Men in Recovery.‚Äù Applied Nursing Research 13(2000):181-186.Hurlbut, Jene M., Leslie K. Robbins, and Mary M. Hoke. ‚ÄúCorrelations Between Spirituality and Health-Promoting Behaviors Among Sheltered Homeless Women.‚Äù Journal of Community Health Nursing 28(2011):81-91. However, it may involve the values of community and relationship, or an emphasis on the connectedness of people. Spirituality often emphasizes the integration of mind, body and spirit, and it can provide a sense of purpose or life significance. There is considerable overlap in the definitions of religion and spirituality and, for this reason, they are often used interchangeably in the literature. Religion, like spirituality, can provide people a sense of purpose or meaning through personal beliefs. The main distinguishing factor between religion and spirituality is that religion is generally practiced collectively with some type of structural or institutional reinforcement. Both terms are multi-faceted and are typically measured along similar dimensions. Common dimensions of spirituality/religion as defined by the National Institute of Healthcare Research and NIA/Fetzer Institute are as follows: * Preference or affiliation: membership in a specific religious or spiritual group * Public practices: involvement in formal activities such as attendances at services * Private practices: private behaviors such as prayer, mediation, or reading sacred texts * Spiritual experiences: interaction or experience with the divine manifested in feelings and sensations * Spiritual coping: how an individual uses beliefs to cope with stressful events; can be positive or negative * Beliefs and values: specific beliefs and values * Forgiveness: experience of reconciliation with others and with the divine, can be a form of spiritual coping * Social support: intangible and tangible support offered by other members of the spiritual/religious community * Intensity/commitment: importance of spirituality relative to other areas of life and its effect on behavior * Spiritual meaning: sense of purpose and meaning of one's life as a result of spirituality These dimensions are simply two examples of measures used in the literature on spirituality. Because of the nebulous definition of spirituality in the literature, measures are not consistent across different studies resulting in a lack of coherence in the literature. However, there is a consensus in research done on spirituality that it influences health. This effect is generally positive with the exception of negative spiritual coping. =Effect on physical health= Spiritual wellbeing has been associated with positive physical health outcomes in research. Spirituality reduces the likelihood of illness and is strongly related to increased longevity. For example, it lowers the rate of heart disease, cirrhosis, emphysema, stroke, kidney failure, cancer mortality, overall mortality. Spirituality also decreases blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If someone does become ill or must endure surgery, they are likely to endure a better recovery. These effects may vary depending on the strictness of behavioral codes associated with a religion, the intensity of the person's practice of spirituality, and whether or not their spiritual experience is a positive one. If someone uses negative spiritual coping, the positive health benefits will not happen and the individual's health may be influenced negatively (see religious/spiritual coping section). =Effect on mental health= Spirituality tends to improve mental health. Spirituality is associated with lower rates of suicide, anxiety disorders, and depression. In regards to depression, individuals who are more spiritually involved are more likely to recover. In a review of forty-three studies, Rew and Wong (2006) found that religiosity and spirituality are important correlates of adolescent health with 84% of the literature indicating a positive correlation.Rew, Lynn, and Y. Joel Wong. \\"A Systematic Review of Associations Among Religiosity/Spirituality and Adolescent Health Attitudes and Behaviors.\\" Journal of Adolescent Health 38(2006):433-442. Spirituality also reduces the likelihood of drug/alcohol dependency or abuse and is associated with a more effective recovery from abuse/dependence. While spirituality generally improves mental health, for individuals who use harmful forms of religious coping, spirituality is \\"correlated with impaired mental health and poorer resolution of negative life events.\\" =Religious/spiritual coping= There are two types of spiritual coping, positive and negative. Positive spiritual coping manifests itself as a strong relationship with God, seeking support from the community and a higher power, looking for meaning in life and helping others.Pargament, Kenneth I., Bruce W. Smith, Harold G. Koening, and Lisa Perez. \\"Patterns of Positive and Negative Religious Coping with Major Life Stressors.\\" Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37(1998): 710-724.Wachholtz, Amy B., Michelle J. Pearce, Harold Koenig. \\"Exploring the Relationship between Spirituality, Coping, and Pain.\\" Journal of Behavioral Medicine 30(2007):311-318. Most people who practice spirituality engage in positive spiritual coping which is associated with improved mental and physical health. Negative spiritual coping, a pattern distinct from positive spiritual coping, has negative health implications. Negative spiritual coping involves deferring all responsibility to God, feeling abandoned by God or blaming God for difficulties. It often manifests itself as a less secure relationship with God, an ominous worldview and general spiritual discontent. For those who engage in negative spiritual coping, it is related to significantly poorer physical and mental health outcomes as well as higher mortality. In a study done by Pargament (1998), negative spiritual coping had differing negative health implications among different populations. For citizens of Oklahoma City who experienced the federal building bombing, it was associated with more post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and higher levels of callousness. For college students, negative spiritual coping was associated with higher levels of emotional distress and poorer physical health. For hospital patients with physical ailments, negative spiritual coping was associated with higher levels of depression and lower quality of life. Role of spirituality in the lives of homeless people A homeless person is an individual without a consistent, fixed nighttime residence or someone whose nighttime residence is a supervised shelter that provides temporary housing.Runquist, Jennifer J., and Pamela G. Reed. \\"Self- Transcendence and Well-Being in Homeless Adults.\\" Journal of Holistic Nursing 25(2007):5-13. Homelessness is a chronic stressor producing reduced wellbeing.Irwin, Jay, Mark LaGory, Ferris Ritchey, and Kevin Fitzpatrick. \\"Social Assets and Mental Distress Among the Homeless: Exploring the Roles of Social Support and Other Forms of Social Capital on Depression.\\" Social Science and Medicine 67(2008): 1935-1943. Homeless populations are a vulnerable population experiencing a higher prevalence of mental and physical health problems as well as victimization and increased mortality rates. Spirituality is one method some homeless individuals use to cope with their position of high vulnerability. Runquist and Reed (2007) found that spiritual perspective correlated positively with measures of wellbeing among the sample of homeless individuals surveyed and that measures of wellbeing correlated positively with self-rated health status. Social capital resulting from spirituality or religion, according to Irwin (2008), is a critical factor to wellbeing among homeless populations. It increases the resource base of the individual enabling them to cope with their situation in healthier ways. =Youth= Youth, typically defined as people between the ages of twelve and twenty-four, make up a large portion of the homeless population.Bender, Kimberly, Sanna J. Thompson, Holly McManus, Janet Lantry and Patrick M. Flynn. \\"Capacity for Survival: Exploring Strengths of Homeless Street Youth.\\" Child Youth Care Forum 36(2007):25-42. As they are a transient population, it is difficult to get an accurate count of homeless youth; the number is commonly thought to be somewhere between 1.3 and 2 million.Ferguson, Kristin M., Qiaobing Wu, Grace Dyrness, and Donna Spruijt-Metz. \\"Perceptions of Faith and Outcomes in Faith-based Programs for Homeless Youth: A Grounded Theory Approach.\\" Journal of Social Service Research 33(2007):25-42.Kidd, Sean A. \\"Street Youth: Coping and Interventions.\\" Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal 20(2003):235-260.Lindsey, Elizabeth W., David Kurtz, Sara Jarvis, Nancy R. Williams, and Lary Nackerud. \\"How Runaway and Homeless Youth Navigate Troubled Waters: Personal Strengths and Resources.\\" Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal 17(2000):115-142. These youth have higher rates of mental health disorders, suicide, and drug/alcohol dependency due to the high amount of stressors in their lives. Spirituality is one of many coping mechanisms homeless youth employ in order to manage life on the streets as well as techniques such as avoidant coping, use of alcohol, interpersonal skills, problem-focused coping and self-reliance. Spirituality as a coping mechanism often serves as positive force in the lives of homeless youth. Kidd (2003) surveyed 80 street youth on the topic of coping and found that spirituality gave meaning to suffering, enabling the youth to process negative emotion and retain some hope. In interviews done by Lindsey et al. (2000), spirituality served as a resource to youth and empowered those engaged in spirituality to redirect their lives in a healthy manner. A theme across multiple studies the coping mechanisms of homeless youth is that their beliefs act as a source of strength and comfort; many attribute their ability to survive to the direct intervention of a higher power or to their faith. One individual in a group discussion conducted by Bender (2007) commented on his engagement with the divine as a source of comfort and survival saying, \\"The man upstairs is what helps me. Just knowing that he's there. There may be times when I feel like he's not there, but he's helping me out slowly.\\" These positive effects of spirituality appear largely in qualitative work, meaning that the youth themselves associate spirituality with improved coping and better mental health. Youth who do not engage in spirituality thus do not use it as a coping mechanism and do not comment on it. There are no examples of negative religious coping among the youth in the studies cited. However, a quantitative study conducted by Kidd and Carroll revealed that spirituality was not associated with a lower suicide risk in homeless youth.Kidd, Sean A., and Michelle R. Carroll. \\"Coping and Suicidality Among Homeless Youth.\\" Journal of Adolescence 30(2007):283-296. Homeless man =Men= For homeless men, specifically those suffering from a substance abuse problem or who are in crisis, spirituality often serves as a positive coping mechanism, giving meaning to life and is tied to a sense of peace.Murray, Ruth Beckmann. \\"Stressors and Coping Strategies of Homeless Men.\\" Journal of Psychosocial Nursing and Mental Health Services 34(1996):16-22. However, positive spiritual coping lessens in its effectiveness the longer someone is homeless and is not as effective for homeless men with mental health problems as for those who are alcohol/drug dependent or in crisis. Many homeless men attribute their ability to get sober to their spirituality, though this may be a product of the spiritual nature of programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. In a study done by Brush and McGee (2000) surveying homeless men in a shelter for recovery, 78% of the respondents commented on how their spiritual views influence their decisions and two thirds agreed or strongly agreed \\"to seeking spiritual guidance in daily life experiences.\\" =Women= Women are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population, making up an estimated 32% of the population.Greene, Jeanie Ahearn, Kim Ball, John R. Belcher, and Catherine McAlphine. \\"Substance Abuse, Homelessness, Developmental Decision-Making and Spirituality: A Women's Health Issue.\\" Journal of Social Work Practice in the Addictions 3(2003):39-54. Many of these women are single mothers. African American women are disproportionately represented among homeless populations as a result of their increased vulnerability to socioeconomic structures. Homeless women, irrespective of ethnicity, tend to have more health problems than the general public including higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues, as well as prior victimization. Spirituality is used as a coping mechanism by many women of various ethnicities to deal with the stress of being homeless and/or to recover from substance abuse. It serves as a source of emotional support as well as a motivating force for women to take care of themselves and their families in a healthy way. Many accredit God with their survival and ability to be clean, looking to their spirituality to guide them in parenting. In a study by Shuler (1994), 42% of homeless women surveyed said their beliefs gave them strength and helped them survive.Shuler, Pamela A., Lillian Gelberg, and Marie Brown. \\"The Effects of Spiritual/Religious Practices on Psychological Well-Being Among Inner City Homeless Women.\\" Nurse Practitioner Forum 5(1994):106-113. For the women who considered prayer an effective coping mechanism, they experienced considerably less worries and depressive symptoms. Increased spirituality is associated with less substance abuse; for women who do not use drugs or alcohol, religious/moral beliefs are often the basis of their decision.Nyamathi, Adeline, Linda Bayley, Nancy Anderson, Colleen Keenan, and Barbara Leake. \\"Perceived Factors Influencing the Initiation of Drug and Alcohol Use Among Homeless Women and Reported Consequences of Use.\\" Women and Health 29(1999):99-114. Higher levels of spirituality is also associated with a lowered risk of depression and suicide among homeless women as well as increased health-promoting behaviors. African-American women Research shows that African Americans as a population, especially women, tend to have higher levels of religious involvement and deep ties to faith and spirituality.Washington, Olivia G. M., David P. Moxley, Lois Garriott, Jennifer P. Weinberger. \\"Five Dimensions of Faith and Spirituality of Older African American Women Transitioning Out of Homelessness.\\" Journal of Religious Health 48(2009):431-444. This is the case for homeless African American women as well; spirituality plays a larger role as a coping mechanism for African American homeless women than other women. Douglas et al. (2008) found that homeless African American women placed a higher importance on spirituality and that lower rates of spiritual well-being among African American homeless mothers resulted in higher anxiety, increased trauma, punitive parenting and child behavioral issues. A study done by Washington et al. (2009) in which older African American homeless women were interviewed found that spirituality was an important asset for these women. Through their faith, they felt empowered to take control of their lives. These women's experience of spirituality also had a mediating effect on their worries and concerns.

He obtained his bachelor's degree in law from National Chung Hsing University in 1972. He then continued his study in international relations at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States where he obtained his master's degree in 1979 and doctoral degree in 1981.

It was eventually absorbed into Campbellsport, Wisconsin (the two had been called \\"The Twin Villages\\"Weekly Wisconsin April 16, 1898; p.6) after the latter was incorporated in 1902, and now constitutes the east end of that village. It was the first settlement in Auburn, having been founded by one Ludin Crouch, a schoolteacher from New York State. Crouch and a Native American companion named Weh-aug-wok-na had come up the Milwaukee River in February 1846 in search of a good site to build a dam for waterpower, and found it at this spot. Crouch and his brother-in-law John Howell returned in the spring and claimed land on each side of the river, in order to build a sawmill. The dam was built; the new settlement was formally named Crouchville on July 4, 1846, and by fall Crouch's sawmill was in operation. It was the first in the region, and supplied demand as far away as Taycheedah. By 1856, having changed hands several times, it had fallen into disuse; one Emil Brayman purchased the site, and started to build a flour mill at that location. He got the village's name changed to New Cassel, after his homeland of Hesse-Cassel, but never completed the flour mill. At that time, the local post office, previously called the Auburn post office, was moved to the New Cassel mill and given the same name as the village.Western Historical Co.

Written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux, the episode sees Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and Linda Belcher (John Roberts) visiting a Wagstaff School exhibition entitled \\"Why I Love Wagstaff.\\" Noticing that their children's reports are missing from the exhibition, they confront school guidance counselor Phillip Frond (David Herman), who gives them the discarded reports to read for themselves. The episode is divided into three segments corresponding to each Belcher child's report: Louise's (Kristen Schaal), a Terminator-inspired science fiction story; Gene's (Eugene Mirman), a musical act parodying Rock 'n' Roll High School; and Tina's (Dan Mintz), a piece of zombie \\"friend fiction\\" which pays homage to Night of the Living Dead. All three stories portray Mr. Frond as an antagonistic character, and he removed them from the exhibition because they were \\"offensive\\" and Frond is already in trouble with the school superintendent because his credentials aren't valid in the state. Comedian Aziz Ansari guest stars in \\"The Frond Files,\\" voicing recurring character Darryl in the episode's first and third segment. It originally aired on Fox on March 9, 2014, drawing an audience of 2.21 million viewers. \\"The Frond Files\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor and pop culture references, and was later cited by Bob's Burgers creator Loren Bouchard as one of his favorite episodes of the series. Plot =Prologue= Bob and Linda are at Wagstaff School for an exhibition themed \\"Why I Love Wagstaff,\\" only to find that their children's reports are nowhere to be seen. They find Mr. Frond, who after unsuccessfully trying to hide from them relents and takes them to his office. Frond explains that he pulled the projects from the exhibition due to their offensiveness, as well as to prevent any further issues with the superintendent, with whom he is already in conflict due to his credentials being invalid in the state. Nonetheless, he allows Bob and Linda to read the reports themselves. =\\"Why I Love Wagstaff\\"= Louise's report begins with the arrival of a robot from the future resembling Mr. Frond, built by the real Frond and sent back in time to eliminate Louise. As Louise flees, she is spotted by an older version of Darryl, who traveled back in time after uncovering Frond's plot. He reveals that the robot was built in retaliation for a prank which Louise will pull off on the day of her eighth-grade graduation ceremony: placing a brownie on Frond's chair, which he sat on thus making him appear to have soiled his pants, which drove him to quit his job from the embarrassment. While pleased with this revelation, Louise chastises Darryl for not bringing back any useful equipment to stop the robot and providing nothing more than a \\"bucket load of exposition and a stupid mustache.\\" Louise and Darryl meet up with Gene and Tina as the chase continues and the four are soon cornered in the cafeteria kitchen, where Louise tricks the Frond robot into jumping into a vat of boiling creamed corn that dissolves it. They celebrate, only to discover more Frond robots, all brandishing the clothes of various supporting characters from the series. The scene cuts to the Belcher siblings sitting at a picnic table in a beach in Mexico (or Belize, as Gene claims), where they have been forced into hiding, as Louise finishes writing her journal. =\\"Fart School for the Gifted\\"= Gene's report re-imagines Wagstaff School as the Fart School for the Gifted, where Gene and his fellow students sing and dance to his original songs about farts. Mr. Frond, however, confiscates his keyboard just as he is about to play his most impressive fart sound effect yet. With the help of his siblings, Gene is able to distract Frond and reclaim the keyboard from \\"Keyboard Jail.\\" Afterwards, he plays a song about farts over the PA system, which ends with a fart so powerful that it ends up destroying the school. =\\"A Tale of Horror\\"= Tina's report is her usual erotic \\"friend fiction;\\" as she carries out her duties as a hall monitor, busting Tammy for sneaking off-campus and then being tricked into letting her go, Tina talks to members of the basketball team, who will be receiving jock itch vaccinations. She later finds the nurse's office in ruins, and at a pep rally the basketball team re-emerges as zombies. Tina, Gene, Louise, Darryl, Jimmy, Jr. (Benjamin), and Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) escape and try to take refuge in the teacher's lounge‚Äîthe only room in the school with a lock‚Äîonly to find that Mr. Frond has locked himself in and is unwilling to let them in, as he needs to survive to rally the survivors. As he explains his cowardice, a zombified nurse emerges from behind and bites him. The horde catches up to them, but Tina discovers her ability to charm the zombies by doing hair flips and awkward erotic dancing; the zombies stop and become her collective boyfriends. =Epilogue= Bob and Linda find that their children's stories are very creative, with Gene's even bringing Linda to tears. Frond then breaks down and reveals that the real reason he refused to display the reports was because all three portray him as a villain. Bob and Linda try to console him and give advice about relating to children, and a rejuvenated Frond decides to deliver a speech to the superintendent, though still refusing to display the reports. He stands up, not noticing that he has been sitting on a brownie the entire time. Bob and Linda keep silent and take Gene's confiscated keyboard as they leave. At the Belcher residence, Louise gets a subconscious feeling that her prank has taken effect. Production \\"The Frond Files\\" was written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and directed by Jennifer Coyle. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bob's Burgers creator Loren Bouchard cited \\"The Frond Files\\" as one of his favorite episodes of the series and stated: \\"Again, the fantasy life of the kids ‚Äî being inside their heads for so long is really fun for us.\\" Bouchard revealed that producing Gene's musical number in the episode's second segment \\"was such a fun indulgence\\" for the Bob's Burgers crew. Comedian Aziz Ansari guest stars in \\"The Frond Files,\\" reprising his role as the recurring character Darryl; the episode's first segment depicts an older version of the character who travels back in time to present-day Wagstaff School. Ansari first revealed his appearance in a Reddit \\"Ask Me Anything\\" thread, where he stated that the episode was a \\"great idea\\" and that \\"anyone [who] is a fan of Terminator 2 is going to be VERY pleased.\\" On March 7, 2014, two previews of the episode were uploaded to YouTube: a clip from \\"Fart School for the Gifted\\" on the Animation Domination channel, and a behind-the-scenes animatic on the Behind Bob's Burgers channel. An official poster for \\"The Frond Files,\\" designed by Hector Reynoso and Anthony Aguinaldo, was later posted on the official Bob's Burgers writers' blog on March 9, coinciding with the episode's airing, followed by an extended music video of Gene's fart song on March 18. The episode was dedicated to the memory of Oliver Miles Cross, writers Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux's nephew. Cross died in 2013 from leukemia at the age of 5. Wendy went on to channel a fundraiser to raise funds for CureSearch in his honor.https://curesearch.org/Bobs- Burgers-Writer-Channels-Hatred-to-Raise-30000-for-Childrens-Cancer Cultural references Louise's segment, \\"Why I Love Wagstaff,\\" is a science fiction story that bases major elements of its plot, including the arrival of a robot from the future, on the Terminator film series ‚Äì in particular the second installment, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). A scene in the segment where the central characters take refuge in a kitchen references a similar scene from the 1993 film Jurassic Park. Gene's segment, \\"Fart School for the Gifted,\\" spoofs the 1979 musical comedy film Rock 'n' Roll High School and plays on the \\"adults v. kids theme of '80s films.\\" Also Mr. Frond's appearance is based on Principal Vader, also from Rock and Roll High School. Tina's segment, \\"A Tale of Horror,\\" is a homage to the 1968 zombie horror film Night of the Living Dead, and as such is animated in black-and-white. Reception \\"The Frond Files\\" first aired in the United States on March 9, 2014 on Fox, as a part of the Animation Domination programming block. It marked the series' return after a two-month hiatus, along with its debut at new earlier 7:00 time slot to make way for airings of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. The episode was watched by 2.21 million viewers and received a 0.9/3 Nielsen rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, becoming the fourth most-watched program of the Animation Domination block for the night. Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave \\"The Frond Files\\" a grade of B+, writing that the episode was \\"incredibly funny and reminded [her] of why the Belchers are [her] favorite family currently on television.\\" However, she felt that the episode \\"didn't quickly become a favorite the way that many Bob's Burgers episodes do\\" and was unsure of whether she \\"dug the vignette format,\\" adding: \\"Much of it, as funny as it was, seemed like a retreading of things that we already knew.\\" Nonetheless, Viruet was positive towards its \\"one-liners and quick jokes\\" and stated that \\"every character‚Äîand every voice actor‚Äîwas on point.\\" Giving the episode an 8.9 out of 10, Robert Ham of Paste cited \\"The Frond Files\\" as \\"one of the finest and funniest [episodes] of an already great fourth season.\\" Ham wrote: \\"The whole thing is one ridiculous and brilliant pop culture reference and bit of silliness after the other. Yet, it again emphasizes the deep bond that the family has.\\" Matt Brassil of Heave Media praised the Terminator and Jurassic Park references in Louise's act of the episode, and while noting that Gene's story \\"falls a little flat to lower your expectations,\\" described Tina's \\"zombie love story\\" as \\"easily the funniest act...loose on plot but high on substance.\\" References External links * * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Bob's Burgers (season 4) episodes ","title":"The Frond Files"},{"id":"42222646","text":"Allium douglasii, the Douglas onion, is a plant species native to northeastern Oregon, eastern Washington, and northern Idaho.

It was commissioned by South African financier Sir Abraham Bailey, 1st Baronet to commemorate the politicians and statesmen of Britain and its allies who held office during the First World War. It was donated to the National Portrait Gallery in 1930, shortly after it was completed. Background Bailey commissioned two other commemorative portraits, General Officers of World War I (originally entitled Some General Officers of the Great War) by John Singer Sargent, and Naval Officers of World War I by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope. Bailey paid ¬£5,000 for each of the three paintings and donated all three to the National Portrait Gallery. The third painting, of statesmen, was first offered to Sir William Orpen, but Orpen declined as he had already been commissioned as the official British artist of the Versailles Peace Conference (see, for example, The Signing of Peace in the Hall of Mirrors). Sargent suggested Guthrie instead. As preparatory work, Guthrie painted a study of each subject separately, considerably delaying the process. He held sittings in the springs and early summers of 1919 to 1921. After a delay caused by Guthrie's illness, the work was first exhibited at the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh in early 1930. Guthrie died in September 1930 before he could complete the final finishing touches before it went on display in London in October 1930. His 17 oil studies and an oil sketch of the composition were donated to Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Guthrie's study of Louis Botha was used by Sargent in making his painting of general officers. Painting The work measures . It is a group portrait of seventeen figures, some seated and some standing. Unlike the companion paintings by Sargent and Cope, which adopt landscape format to accommodate the many subjects, Guthrie used a portrait format. The subjects are depicted as if in conference around a table in a large hall, in the shadow of a sculpture based on the Winged Victory of Samothrace, with Doric columns to either side and coffered vault above.

He was instrumental in obtaining support for a new system of education of agricultural workers, farmers and proprietors. Early years Charles-Gilbert Tourret was born in Montmarault, Allier, on 22 December 1795. He entered the √âcole Polytechnique in 1814 and graduated as an engineer of roads and bridges. He began a career as a senior official, but then turned to the study and practice of agriculture in his native department. This became his lifetime passion, and he became known as an expert in agronomy. Politician Tourret ran for election on 21 June 1834 for the college of Allier, Montlu√ßon, but was defeated. He ran again for the same constituency on 4 November 1837 and was elected. He sat among the opposition. He was reelected on 2 March 1839. He resigned in 1842 to give his seat to General Amable de Courtais. He ran again on 1 August 1846 but was defeated. From 1842 to 1852 Tourret was a member of the general council on agriculture. After the revolution of 1848 Tourret joined the Republican group. For a period he acted as provisional head of government of Allier. He was returned for Allier to the Constituent Assembly in the elections on 23 April 1848. He was opposed to the institution of two chambers, and to the proposal to dissolve the Constituent Assembly before the organic laws had been passed. He opposed the expedition to Rome. Tourret was among the moderate Republicans in the Constitutional Commission. He was among 18 deputies charged with preparing a first draft of a new constitution. They met from 19 May 1848 to 17 June 1848. Tourret caused a proposal to guarantee savings banks to be rejected, due to fears raised by the near-bankruptcy of the state in February and March of that year. He opposed appointment of local officials by the executive in favor of election by municipal councils, a small step towards decentralization. Minister On 28 June 1848 General Louis- Eug√®ne Cavaignac chose Tourret as Minister of Agriculture in his new cabinet. As minister, Tourret defended a law to establish a three-tier system of agricultural education. Farm schools would give a practical education to laborers and smallholders, including hands-on training. Regional schools would give a rather more theoretical education, with a solid practical foundation, for proprietors and farmers. A national agronomic institute would train professors and administrators. The national institute would recruit professors from the \\"summits of science\\". To attract them it would have to be located close to Paris, but in a rural area with gardens, farms and forests. Versailles would be a suitable location, available now that the king had been deposed. Courses would have a two-year duration, and the three best pupils each year would receive three-year scholarships to pursue agricultural studies. Tourret's proposal was submitted to the agriculture and farm credit committee of the Assembly, which proposed various amendments. The rapporteur was citizen Antoine Richard du Cantal, who noted that cultivators had long been neglected by previous regimes, and presented the project as a great revolutionary measure. Richard added the objective of instilling love of the Republic to that of instilling love of the land. The text was debated in the Assembly on 22 September 1848, and received a generally favorable reception. The project was criticized on the basis of costs. One member suggested that children studying at the elementary level should continue to work in the fields, receiving education in the mornings or evenings. Others felt the education should be limited to farmer-proprietors, since they alone would cause progress to be made in agriculture in France. Amable Dubois felt that there were no qualified teachers, and that the peasants would resist any form of theoretical instruction. The royalists were the most hostile to the project of educating the workers. The debate between supporters and opponents was heated. Eventually, on 3 October 1848, the decree for agricultural education and creation of agricultural schools was adopted by 579 out of 679 votes. The only major amendment was to align the schools with departments rather than arrondissements. Tourret also conceived of the idea of an international exposition, but this was abandoned due to the uncertainty of the times and the claims of other projects. Later years Tourret resigned with the rest of the cabinet on 20 December 1848 after General Cavaignac was defeated in the Presidential elections. He took a position of mild opposition to the government of Louis Napoleon. After his resignation Tourret refused to sit as a member of the Legislative Assembly. He devoted the last years of his life to agriculture. He died on 17 May 1858, aged 62.

It was listed as #34 on the New York Times Bestseller list for Hardcover Fiction in the November 2, 2008, issue of The New York Times Book Review. It has been adapted into a film by the same name starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. The film was released in October 2014. Plot The year is 1929, and newlyweds George and Serena Pemberton travel from Boston to the North Carolina mountains where they plan to create a timber empire. George has already lived in the camp long enough to father an illegitimate child by young Rachel Harmon but Serena is new to the mountains. Upon stepping off the train in Waynesville, George is confronted by Rachel's father, Abe Harmon, who is angry that George has abandoned his daughter. Abe attacks George with bowie knife. Ultimately George wins the battle and kills Abe. George also meets his business partners Wilkie and Buchanan at the train station and introduces them to his new wife, Serena. Serena will soon show herself to be the equal of any man, overseeing crews, hunting rattlesnakes, even saving her husband's life in the wilderness. Together, the Pembertons ruthlessly kill or vanquish all who fall out of favor. Meanwhile, Rachel Harmon struggles to take care of her son, Jacob. When Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons' intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel. In the climax, Serena poisons George and leaves him to die in the woods. Desperately, he attempts to drag himself back to the lumber camp, certain that Serena will be waiting and that everything will be as it was before. Hearing the sound of light footsteps, George is certain that Serena has changed her mind and is returning for him. It is implied, though, that he is finished off by a panther. In an epilogue set in 1975, an elderly Rachel Harmon reads a Life Magazine interview with Serena, who has prospered as a lumber baroness in Brazil, in a Seattle hospital. On his next visit, Rachel shows the interview to her son. Soon after, Serena and her henchman, Galloway, are murdered in their hacienda by an assailant armed with a knife. A guard comes on the scene as Serena was dying, however, and identifies her fleeing killer as identical to an old photograph of George. The guard's account is discounted by the Brazilian police. =Major Characters= *Serena Pemberton - Protagonist and Pemberton‚Äôs wife.

Through many business booms and busts, as well as several changes of ownership, it has continued to operate until today, when it is owned by Aecon Atlantic Industrial Inc.http://www.pictoushipyard.com/ Early shipbuilding and repairs Although the official founding by W. H. Davies did not occur until 1856, Pictou's ship registry began in 1840.Cameron, James M. (1990). The Ships, Shipbuilders and Seamen of Pictou County. Antigonish, Nova Scotia: Pictou County Historical Society. Shipbuilding and ship repair began in Pictou in various places near the town a few years after settlement in 1773 via the Hector, with the first cargo of squared timber leaving Pictou in 1774. Other than the current site itself, the most significant site in the shipbuilding industry was located on Windmill Point where Captain William Lowden first settled in 1788. He eventually moved into the town of Pictou and continued his ship work. Captain Lowden is traditionally considered to be the father of shipbuilding in Pictou County, as he was made famous by his construction of the Harriet in 1798. At 600 tons she was built with room for twenty-four guns and was supposed to be the largest and finest ship built in the province at that time. He was not the first builder, however, as there is a record of a small one-mast vessel being launched in Pictou Harbour in 1788 by Thomas Copeland, and the county's first schooner named the Anne was built in 1788 at Merigomish, Nova Scotia. Shipbuilding and work continued throughout the early 1800s. Before the age of steam the types of ships built were schooners, brigs, and brigantines, barques and barquentines and full-rigged ships. Most notable was the yard's work on the SS Royal William on her fully steam-powered voyage across the Atlantic. A foundry in Pictou W. H. Davies, who left the Albion Iron Foundry in 1854, completed and managed his own foundry on the Pictou waterfront in 1856. Davies's sons George and Charles carried on the foundry's operation until the late 1800s, when they sold it to Joseph Robb and Douglas Hannon. In 1906 Allan A. Ferguson bought out the interests of Robb, and the business was renamed as the Pictou Foundry and Machine Company. In 1910 Douglas Hannon died, and Ferguson became the sole owner and head of the business. Ferguson ownership During Ferguson's twenty-five years of management of the foundry, it was diversified, with an expansion of machine, moulding, boiler, carpenter and pattern-work operations. This allowed for the lease of machine-shop facilities to early automobile mechanics. During 1913 the plant was equipped with electromotive power and was the first in the area to change from steam. After the outbreak of the Great War, the company participated in the war effort and machine finished thousands of shells forged in Trenton, Nova Scotia. Once the war was over and peace was enjoyed for another two decades, the primary work for the Pictou Foundry and Machine Company was both steel and wooden ship and dredge repairs. Ferguson died in 1932, and the business was then taken over by his eldest son, Robert A. Ferguson, who upon the outbreak of war was joined by his three brothers, Allan A. Ferguson Junior, Thomas Ferguson and James Ferguson. Before World War Two there had not been a ship launched in Pictou since the barque Orquell in 1879. Park ships Britain had been at war for less than a year when it was realized that Germany was destroying Britain's merchant ships faster than they could be replaced. Due to Britain's focus on the production of its own naval ships, it did not have the capacity to keep up with merchant vessel losses. This led to a British shipbuilding commission arriving in North America in October 1940 looking for help to supply the much needed transport. The commission found the help they were looking for, and the Canadian government was charged with the immediate construction of twenty-six 10,000-ton cargo ships for Britain. At the same time Canada decided to build more ships for its own benefit. It was some of these additional ships that would be built as Park ships in Pictou. A totally of twenty-four 4,700-ton Scandinavian class freighters would eventually be built, but not before major preparation and expansion measures were completed to the yard and town to accommodate the new booming business. When the good news hit Pictou on October 9, 1941, the Pictou shipyard consisted of a marine slip with refit and repair capability. Major changes thus had to be made, launch ways had to be built, and more space had to be created. To create more space, the landmark of Battery Hill was bulldozed to make room for the new yard. Along with the new developments, the new yard was taken over by Foundation Maritime Shipbuilding Limited. This allowed for the Ferguson brothers to retain the operations of the original marine slip and carry out repairs and refits to naval vessels. The first ship to be built was the SS Victoria Park, which was launched on October 22, 1942. Twenty-three more would follow. The twenty-four Park ships built in Pictou were as follows:Wallis, The Story of Pictou‚Äôs Park Ships. { width=\\"40\\" valign=\\"top\\" * SS Victoria Park * SS Camp Debert/Crescent Park * SS Camp Aldershot/Rockcliffe Park * SS Camp Petawawa/Montmorency Park * SS Kensington Park * SS Manitou Park * SS Woodland Park * SS Ainslie Park width=\\"40\\" valign=\\"top\\" * SS Hector Park/Camp Debert * SS Chignecto Park * SS Camp Petawawa/Beresford Park * SS Camp Sussex/Avondale Park * SS Confederation Park * SS Cataraqui Park * SS Galt Park/Kelowna Park * SS Taber Park width=\\"40\\" valign=\\"top\\" * SS Parkdale Park/Liscomb Park * SS Wentworth Park * SS Sunset Park * SS Ashby Park * SS Evangeline Park * SS Mulgrave Park * SS Sutherland Park * SS Lorne Park } After World War II The Dartmouth III ferry was launched at Pictou in 1978. She served as a harbour ferry in halifax until 2016 and was then transferred to Toronto for service there With the twenty- four Park ships built and the war over, Foundation Maritime Limited closed the shipyard and the equipment was sold. Convinced that shipbuilding could be a viable industry in Pictou, the Ferguson brothers, with the support of the Nova Scotia government, took over the shipyard building and re-equipped the yard. Although the senior brother, Robert A. Ferguson, died in 1942, the remaining brothers continued the firm, incorporated it as Ferguson Industries Ltd. and gained official ownership of the entire yard. The Fergusons built 107 steel ships in the post‚ÄìWorld War Two years, which included barges, trawlers, and ferry boats. The Fergusons' ownership lasted until 1984, when the firm faced bankruptcy and entered receivership.

The recruits ‚Äì all of them men ‚Äì pledged to show a \\"chivalrous respect for womanhood\\", to apply ideas of purity equally to men and women, and not to indulge in foul language or indecent behaviour. It was renamed the White Cross League in 1891, and merged with the Church of England Purity Society, which had been formed by Edward White Benson. The organisation was Christian in ethos but, at the insistence of Hopkins and somewhat unusually for a purity association, it was non-denominational in practice. Its name was symbolic: White denoted purity, Cross referred to the campaign being for Christ, and Army reflected its disciplined nature. It adopted as its motto the words of Sir Galahad: The army based its structure on that of the temperance movement. Its target audience was mostly working-class men, who were exhorted to pledge their support for its aims by speakers at mass meetings. In lectures delivered by the organisation, the pledge of purity was defined for married men as the practice of sexual restraint, while young and unmarried men were expected to practice chastity and renounce masturbation. As with the Church of England Purity Society, whose goals were similar but aimed at upper-class men, the Army believed that it was men who should be responsible for sexual virtue. There were 102 affiliated branches in Britain within a year of formation, and branches in Australia, Canada, Germany, India and the United States. The British branches had attracted 2000 pledge-takers in that time and were mostly in the industrialised regions of The Midlands and North England.

Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism, Ch. 10 Atisha's contemplations on death: #Death is inevitable. #Our life span is decreasing continuously. #Death will come, whether or not we are prepared for it. #Human life expectancy is uncertain. #There are many causes of death. #The human body is fragile and vulnerable. #At the time of death, our material resources are not of use to us. #Our loved ones cannot keep us from death. #Our own body cannot help us at the time of our death. Other Tibetan Buddhist practices deal directly with the moment of death, preparing the meditator for entering and navigating the Bardo, the intermediate stage between life and death. This is the theme of the popular Great Liberation through hearing during the intermediate state (Tibetan Book of the Dead).

He is also the Vice- President of Prosperity Party. He previously served as Chairman of the ADP (Amhara Democratic Party) and Deputy Chair of EPRDF until dissolution of the parties on 1 December 2019. Life and education Demeke was born in Gojjam province, and later was resettled to Chagni Woreda of the Agew Awi in Gojjam province when the Derg regime relocated people to resettle in other areas. He is a Muslim Amhara. Demeke was sent to a high school in Feres Bet, a town located in Dega Damot Woreda in Mirab Gojjam Zone, off the main road from Addis Ababa to Bahir Dar. Later he joined the Addis Ababa University and studied Biology in the Arat Kilo campus and received his BA in 1988. He also earned his MA in Political Science from Bradford University. After graduation, he returned to his native region to begin his career as a teacher. He taught biology in Feres Bet High School, for two years, before he was transferred to Bure town in the same province. It was in Bure, which housed the lone high school in the area named after former governor of the region, Ras Bitwoded Mengesha Atikim, that Demeke met Alemitu Kassaye, a student of the high school at that time, and his future wife and mother of his three children. Political career Demeke joined Amhara's ruling ADP in the early 1990s. Demeke first took part in the national election held in 1995, and won a seat in the Amhara Regional Council, where he was appointed general secretary. In the middle of his term, he went to England to do his post graduate studies in conflict management. Upon his return in 2001, he was assigned to establish and lead the ethics and anti-corruption commission of the region. He was then moved to head the administrative and security affairs bureau of the region, where he had served up until 2005. He was then promoted to the vice presidency of the regional state following the highly contested election in 2005, under the presidency of Ayalew Gobeze. A year later, he was elected to the executive committee of ANDM, a member of the EPRDF coalition formed in 1983, in Jerba Yohannes of Wag Himra Zone. Finally, he was elevated to the position of deputy chair of the party replacing Tefera Walwa; and in 2010 became the first non- combatant chairman of the ANDM, replacing Addisu Legesse. Demekes first role on the national level within the ruling EPRDF coalition began 2008, when he took over the post of Minister of Education under the then Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. He continued to serve as Minister of Education until July 2013, when he resigned due to his heavy workload as Deputy Prime Minister. Demeke had assumed the role of the Deputy Prime Minister of Ethiopia in September 2012 under Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. The main task given to Demeke in 2012 was the coordination of efforts to implement and further the Growth and Transformation Plan across all governmental ministries and agencies. In late 2015, the lower than expected spring and summer rains and the upcoming El Nino event resulted in a severe drought in Ethiopia in 2016, considered the worst drought in 30 years, with up to 10% of Ethiopians in the eastern and southern parts of Ethiopia requiring international assistance to survive in 2016 and 2017. The Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen was assigned to the task to organize the government response and to organize the food aid provided by international organizations. On 15 February 2018, the then Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced his resignation. It was then expected, that the ruling EPRDF would name the Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen as the successor to Hailemariam, but this did not happen. Instead, Hailemariam continued as a caretaker until the election of a new Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed Ali, on 2 April 2018. Demeke Mekonnen was kept as Deputy Prime Minister under the new government.
