Background In 1998, with the appointment of new executive producer Richard Handford, discussions were made with broadcaster ITV to return to the format of hour-long episodes, which the show last used on a regular basis in 1987. As such, beginning in August 1998, the show returned to a twice-weekly hour-long format, which it retained for many years until the decision to move the show to a later time-slot came in 2009. It is notable that the first few episodes broadcast in the hour-long format were originally written for the half hour time-slot, and thus, some episodes contain two completely different stories, written by different writers, which jump from one to another. For example, the opening episode, \\"Deep End\\", was initially written in three twenty-five minute parts, with a fourth epilogue episode, the first half of \\"The Party's Over\\", all conceived by Elizabeth Anne-Wheal. A separate story by Neil Clarke, initially envisaged as an entirely separate episode, was broadcast as the second half of \\"The Party's Over\\". The new format also attempted to introduce a more serialized element to the programme, with the first two stories taking place over multiple episodes, however following these two serials, individual stand-alone episodes were retained. The attempt to serialize the programme wasn't made again until June 1999, which saw another four-part serial again featuring PC Eddie Santini and WPC Rosie Fox, however, once again, individual episodes were retained. The series finally made a successful crossover into the serialized format in October 2000, with a major eight-part story, which saw the collapse of CID and the end of DS Don Beech. This series saw a small number of changes to the cast. CID saw the loss of three-long serving officers, DS Alistair Greig and DCs Suzi Croft and Tosh Lines. Actor Kevin Lloyd was sensationally dismissed from the show for alcoholism, and died just days after his last episode was aired. Croft and Lines were subsequently replaced by DCs Kerry Holmes and Duncan Lennox late in the year. The series also saw the return of DCI Frank Burnside, who had last appeared in 1993.

The railway line was entirely inside the municipality of Fauske in Nordland county, Norway. The line was built in 1891, over time it was lengthened until 1958 when it was connected to the Nordland Line (having a different rail gauge) and the sea port at Finneid. It existed as a branch of the Nordland Line from 1958 until 1972 when the line was closed and removed. The railway line followed the path of the present-day Norwegian County Road 830. History Construction of the line started in May 1891 when the mining company in Sulitjelma decided to build a railway between Sj√∏nst√• and Fossen. Sj√∏nst√• is located on the shore of the lake √òvrevatnet, close to sea level. The track was immediately extended along the Sj√∏nst√• River to Hellarmo the following year. Hellarmo is a small village area that sits on the western edge of the lake Langvatnet higher up the valley, about from Sj√∏nst√•. It was the first railway line to be built in Northern Norway. The mining products were transported by barges on the lakes. This was not possible when ice covered the lakes, so in the winter the mining products were stored. The mine in Sulitjelma was expanded into the mountains at Fagerli in 1912, and at the same time the gauge was increased from to . The line also was extended all the way to the mine in Sulitjelma. The official opening of the renovated and extended line was on 15 July 1915. The track between Sandnes and Fagerli (in the village of Sulitjelma) was removed in 1950. In 1953, work began on extending the line from Sj√∏nst√• on the lake √òvrevatnet all the way to Finneid on the coast of the Skjerstad Fjord in the town of Fauske. The new extension would connect the line to the main Nordland Line in Fauske. Three tunnels, Gr√∏nnlifjell Tunnel, H√•rskolten Tunnel and Sj√∏nst√•fjell Tunnel, each with a length of were built. The reason was that the lake barge transport had difficulties in the winter. Operation of the line all the way to Finneid started in December 1956. Another new tunnel through the small Stokkviknakken mountain was opened on 30 November 1962. After this, the railway had a total length of . The line closed on 22 July 1972 and it was rebuilt, including the tunnels, as Norwegian County Road 830. This work was completed in 1975.

It connects Hazel and Clear Lake. SD 22 originally extended from the Wyoming state line, following what is now U.S. Route 212 (US 212). When the US 212 was established, SD 22 was truncated to travel from SD 45 in northern Hand County to SD 41 (current US 281) south of Redfield. This is now SD 26\\\\. The current alignment was established in the mid-1930s, with a north‚Äìsouth portion from Hazel to US 212\\\\. This last portion was decommissioned in the 1990s. Route description SD 22 begins at an intersection with the northern terminus of 1st Street and the southern terminus of Mustang Avenue in the north-central part of Hazel, within the northwestern part of Hamlin County. Here, the roadway continues to the west as Hamlin County Road 181/181st Street. SD 22 travels to the east. Just east of William Street, it crosses over some railroad tracks of BNSF Railway. Just east of 444th Avenue, it travels just south of the Baxter Slough State Public Shooting Area. East of 449th Avenue, it travels through Thomas. the highway then curves to the southeast to travel around the southwestern part of Clear Lake. Just east of 451st Avenue, it curves to the east-northeast. Just west of 452nd Avenue, it curves to the east-southeast. East of 454th Avenue, it travels through the Five Ponds area. It then intersects US 81\\\\. The two highways travel concurrently to the south-southeast. Here, the roadway continues to the east as 181st Street. At 183rd Street, SD 22 splits off to the east-northeast. Just east of 458th Avenue, it crosses over the Big Sioux River and then travels just north of Castlewood. An intersection with the northern terminus of 2nd Avenue leads to Castlewood. An intersection with 459th Avenue and the northern terminus of 4th Avenue, which is signed as a \\"city truck route\\", leads to a city park. East of 461st Avenue, it crosses over Stray Horse Creek and then curves to the north-northeast. Almost immediately, it curves back to the east. East of 465th Avenue, it has an interchange with Interstate 29 (I-29). While traveling under the Interstate highway, it enters the west-central part of Deuel County. SD 22 continues to the east through rural areas of the county. East of 475th Avenue, it enters the southern part of Clear Lake. It has an intersection with SD 15\\\\. Just after leaving Clear Lake, it crosses over Hidewood Creek. Just to the east of 476th Avenue, it curves to the southeast to travel around the southeastern part of Clear Lake. Just west of Clear Lake Road, it begins to curve to the east-northeast. Just west of 479th Avenue, it curves to the east again. Just west of 485th Avenue, it crosses over Cobb Creek. Just to the east of this intersection is a second crossing of this creek. Just west of 486th Avenue, the highway curves to the east-northeast. Along a curve to the south- southeast, it intersects the southern terminus of SD 101\\\\. It crosses over Cobb Creek for a third time and then curves to the south-southwest. Just north of County Road 22A (CR 22A; 478th Avenue), the highway curves back to the east. Just east of 184th Street, it reaches its eastern terminus, at the Minnesota state line. Here, the roadway continues as Minnesota State Highway 68 (MN 68). SD 22 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense. History When SD 22 was originally established in the 1920s, its western terminus was at the Wyoming state line. It followed what is now US 212 along this path. When US 212 was established in 1927, SD 22 was shifted onto a new alignment. It traveled from SD 45 in northern Hand County to SD 41 (what is now US 281) south of Redfield. This alignment is now the path of SD 26\\\\. The current path of SD 22 was established by 1936, and included a north‚Äìsouth segment from Hazel to US 212\\\\.

Biography Born August 29, 1951 in Haifa, Israel, Lupolianski studied at the Yavne School in Haifa and then attended Yeshivat Hanegev and Yeshivat Torah Ore. He served in the Israel Defense Forces as a paramedic and worked as a teacher at a religious school in Jerusalem. Lupolianski is married to Michal Lupolianski (Schneller), granddaughter of Rabbi Isaac Breuer. They have 12 children. Political career Lupolianski was Deputy Mayor, chairperson of the Planning and Building Committee and responsible for the Family Services and Community portfolio. He was a member of the National Building and Planning Committee and the Committee for the Development of Holy Places. Lupolianski is a member of the Degel Hatorah party which ran for elections together with Agudat Israel in a united party called United Torah Judaism. In the 2003 municipal election, Lupolianski ran for mayor under the United Torah Judaism ticket. This was part of a rotation deal which stated that in the next election, the ticket would nominate a candidate from Agudat Israel. He was elected on June 6, 2003, after serving on the Jerusalem City Council from 1989. Mayoral term To attract students to Jerusalem's institutions of higher education, Lupolianski inaugurated the \\"Lupolianski Package\\" which offers special tuition and housing subsidies to university students renting apartments in the city center. Hi-tech workers who choose to live and work in Jerusalem are also eligible for a monthly grant to cover part of their living expenses. Lupolianski was accused of preferring Jews for civil service over Arabs, and of basing municipal decisions on his religious views. During his tenure as mayor, Lupolianski clashed with the Israeli gay and lesbian community for trying to stop or change the venue of their annual Gay pride parade in Jerusalem. Yad Sarah In 1976, Lupolianski founded the Yad Sarah organization to help the elderly and disabled. The organization is named for his Polish grandmother, who died in the Holocaust. It lends out medical equipment and supplies a variety of services to the sick, elderly and lonely. Yad Sarah has a network of 6,000 volunteers working out of 96 branches, and serves all sectors of the population. Awards Before becoming mayor, Lupolianski won the President's Volunteer Prize, the Knesset Speaker's Award and the Kaplan Prize for Efficiency. In 1994, he accepted the Israel Prize on behalf of Yad Sarah. Holyland case On January 5, 2011, he was indicted with 17 others for allegedly giving or receiving bribes to advance various real estate ventures, particularly the Holyland development. However, unlike the others in the case, Lupolianski never received any money himself. Rather, the money was sent to a Jerusalem charity that assists poor people in the city. In March 2014, he was found guilty of corruption.

It also serves some areas of the districts of Salford and Trafford. The company was founded as Green Triangle Buses and then subsequently renamed South Lancs Travel before being purchased by Rotala and rebranded as Diamond North West in 2015. In August 2019, Diamond North West purchased First Manchester's Bolton depot. History=South Lancs Travel= Former South Lancs Travel logo Northern Counties Palatine bodied Volvo Citybus in February 2004 Wright Meridian bodied MAN NL273F at Wigan bus station in August 2009 Optare Solo in February 2013 Green Triangle Buses was established in April 1998 by Martin Bott and David Stewart. The new business began with two new Mercedes-Benz Varios which were used on a Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive tender. These were joined by three South Lancashire Transport (also owned by the two partners) single deckers for use on school services. Further Varios were quickly added to the fleet, which were used on Green Triangle's first commercial service, route 675 a half-hourly service between Leigh and Shakerley via Astley and Tyldesley. Less than a year later, route 675 was withdrawn and replaced with the 670/680 circular services. This essentially provided an extension to the existing service, running back to Leigh via Atherton. This was supplemented through the introduction of route 652 (Leigh - Hindley - Wigan). All three services directly competed against the incumbent operator, Bellairs & Dootson. An opportunity for expansion came in 1998 with the opening of the Trafford Centre. Green Triangle introduced two new daytime services to the centre in the form of the 673 from Atherton and the 674 from Leigh. The 673 only lasted a short time, although the link was later reinstated as the 132; the 674 continues to this day, although it is now numbered 126. In 1999 the business of Bellairs & Dootson was purchased.Companies House extract company no 3626201 B&D; Coaches Limited The combined operation was rebranded as South Lancs Travel. In 2000 the depot was relocated to its current premises. Since then, the company has steadily expanded its network, primarily through tender gains. This expansion took the company deeper into both Wigan and Bolton, with the most significant gain being the award of the GMPTE Easylink network of services. Commercial work was also added, with SLT taking over route 592 (between Shakerley and Bolton) in 2002, acquiring the service from the one-man Atherton Bus Company following the retirement of the owner. This was linked up with an existing service to form a through service from Leigh to Bolton. The company also added a network of services in western Wigan in 2005, when it purchased Blue Bus of Bolton's Appley Bridge outstation. This included a small network of services to Shevington, Standish, Orrell and New Springs. The Appley Bridge outstation closed in May 2007. In 2006 entrepreneur Julian Peddle bought a 30% stake in the company. SLT has more recently expanded its network of services in Bolton, introducing the 514 (in 2009) and 574 (in 2011) services to Middlebrook, as well as taking over service 515 to Ladybridge in 2011 when Arriva North West decided to withdraw the route. It also introduced service 516/517 to Horwich, replacing a similar First Manchester service but on an improved frequency. However, this was soon followed by the withdrawal of the 652. South Lancs Travel have also been involved in head-to-head competition with First Manchester on a number of occasions. The most notable of these took place in 2002, when, following competitive registrations by First, SLT offered \\"return tickets for the price of a single fare\\" - First responded with a ¬£2.00 (later ¬£2.50 then ¬£3.00) weekly ticket for travel within the Leigh area. First also introduced a short-lived competing 652 service, albeit operating from Hindley Green to Shakerley via Leigh. More recently, First introduced a competing 635 service - SLT retaliated by introducing journeys on the 600 between Wigan and Ashton-in-Makerfield, and offering a ¬£1.00 flat fare. Following the withdrawal of First Greater Manchester services to Shevington, the SLT 600 was withdrawn in May 2008 and SLT is now the sole operator of services to Shevington and Appley Bridge. On 30 September 2011, South Lancs Travel was sold to Julian Peddle and Crewe based D&G; Bus. In January 2012, Strawberry merged with South Lancs Travel and moved its operations to SLT's depot in Atherton. Strawberry's founder Oliver Howarth became joint operations director of the enlarged company. However, he left soon after with Strawberry being acquired by D&G; and Julian Peddle and merged into the main company and the name and livery being dropped in favour of the SLT brand. In January 2013, SLT commenced operating the Bolton Metroshuttle with two Optare Versa hybrids, However they lost that tender to Cumfy Bus in January 2014 who had recently made a move to Bolton following the collapse of Maytree Travel.Bolton's free town centre bus to continue Transport for Greater Manchester 16 November 2012 In October 2013, South Lancs Travel added an hourly service onto Arriva North West's 715 service running from Wigan to Bolton via Aspull, Westhoughton and Ladybridge however in November 2013 the application to go on the route was rejected and the Traffic Commissioner made South Lancs Travel run the service for free for about three weeks.

History Wright Handybus bodied Dennis Dart in January 2008 The company was formed by Arthur Mayne before the First World War, originally delivering furniture from its shop in Bradford, Manchester. In the 1920s Maynes branched out into coach excursions, running trips to the coast and to Buxton. They would later expand to operate trips to football matches and race meetings. By the start of the 1930s, the company had decided to concentrate on passenger transport and would continue to grow during the 1930s moving from Beswick to its present headquarters in Clayton. Coach services ceased when the Second World War broke out and struggled to recover after the war ended, with the costs of fuel, labour and vehicles rising and passenger numbers dropped due to the increase of cars on the road. During the 1960s, the company received numerous take over offers from Manchester Corporation Transport. By resisting the offers, the company was able to grow steadily and would increase its services in the 1980s. In 1982 Barry Cooper Coaches of Warrington was purchased with 20 coaches by members of the Mayne family. Although this was originally a separate business to Mayne, the Mayne name and red and cream livery were soon adopted. In 1989 the coach operations in Manchester expanded into the Fairclough Street depot. In 1998 Barry Cooper Coaches was renamed Mayne Coaches, and moved to its present site. Over the years the company has grown from an initial purpose built coach in 1925 and new bus in 1929, with expansion coming through acquisition of local bus and coach operators, and through purchases of new buses and coaches. The company resisted numerous attempts at nationalisation due to a licensing agreement made in 1930 with Manchester Corporation regarding bus service provision.

He survived the ship's sinking, and became notable for having survived in the frigid water for an exceptionally long time before being pulled onto the overturned Collapsible B lifeboat with virtually no ill effects.  Early life  Charles Joughin (pronounced 'Jockin') was born in Patten Street, next to the West Float in Birkenhead, England, on 3 August 1878 to John Edwin (1846‚Äì1886), a licensed victualler, and Ellen (Crombleholme) Joughin (1850‚Äì1938). He first went to sea in 1889 aged 11, and later became chief baker on various White Star Line steamships, notably the Olympic, Titanic's sister ship.Mr Charles John Joughin, Encyclopedia Titanica. Retrieved on 22 January 2012. On 17 November, 1906, in Liverpool, he married Louise Woodward (born 11 July 1879), a native of Douglas on the Isle of Man. They had a daughter, Agnes Lillian, in 1907, and a son, Roland Ernest, in 1909. Louise is believed to have died from complications in childbirth around 1919, and her new son, Richard, was also lost.  On the Titanic  He was part of the victualling crew of the RMS Titanic during its maiden and final trip in April 1912. He was on board the ship during its delivery trip from Belfast to Southampton. He signed on again in Southampton on 4 April 1912. In the capacity of Chief Baker, Joughin received monthly wages of ¬£12 (equivalent to ¬£ today, adjusted for inflation), and had a staff of thirteen bakers under him.British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry Day 6 ‚Äì Testimony of Charles Joughin, Titanic Inquiry Project. Retrieved on 22 January 2012. When the ship hit an iceberg on the evening of 14 April, at 23:40, Joughin was off-duty and in his bunk. According to his testimony, he felt the shock of the collision and immediately got up. Word was being passed down from the upper decks that officers were getting the lifeboats ready for launching, and Joughin sent his thirteen men up to the boat deck with provisions to the lifeboats: four loaves of bread apiece, about forty pounds of bread each. Joughin stayed behind for a time, but then followed them, reaching the Boat Deck at around 00:30. He joined Chief Officer Henry Wilde by Lifeboat 10. Joughin helped, with stewards and other seamen, the ladies and children through to the lifeboat, although, after a while, the women on deck ran away from the boat saying they were safer aboard the Titanic. The Chief Baker then went on to A Deck and forcibly brought up women and children, throwing them into the lifeboat. The Titanic final plunge. Joughin was at the topmost part of the ship by this point. Although he was assigned as captain of Lifeboat 10, he did not board; it was already being manned by two sailors and a steward. He went below after Lifeboat 10 had gone, and \\"had a drop of liqueur\\" (a tumbler half-full of liqueur, as he went on to specify) in his quarters. He then came upstairs again after meeting \\"the old doctor\\" (possibly Dr. William O'Loughlin, quite possibly the last time anyone ever saw him). When he arrived at the Boat Deck, all the boats had been lowered, so he went down into the A Deck promenade and threw about fifty deck chairs overboard so that they could be used as flotation devices. Joughin then went into the deck pantry on A Deck to get a drink of water and, whilst there, he heard a loud crash, \\"as if part of the ship had buckled\\". He left the pantry, and joined the crowd running aft toward the poop deck. As he was crossing the well deck, the ship suddenly gave a list over to port and, according to him, threw everyone in the well in a bunch except for him. Joughin climbed to the starboard side of the poop deck, getting hold of the safety rail so that he was on the outside of the ship as it went down by the head. As the ship finally sank, Joughin rode it down as if it were an elevator, not getting his head under the water (in his words, his head \\"may have been wetted, but no more\\"). He was, thus, the last survivor to leave the RMS Titanic. Collapsible B is found by the CS Mackay-Bennett. According to his own testimony, he kept paddling and treading water for about two hours. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to the alcohol he had imbibed. (Large quantities of alcohol generally increase the risk of hypothermia.) When daylight broke, he spotted the upturned Collapsible B, with Second Officer Charles Lightoller and around twenty-five men standing on the side of the boat. Joughin slowly swam towards it, but there was no room for him. A man, however, cook Isaac Maynard, recognized him and held his hand as the Chief Baker held onto the side of the boat, with his feet and legs still in the water. Another lifeboat then appeared and Joughin swam to it and was taken in, where he stayed until he boarded the RMS Carpathia that had come to their rescue. He was rescued from the sea with only swollen feet.  Later life  After surviving the Titanic disaster, he returned to England, and was one of the crew members who reported to testify at the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry headed by Lord Mersey. In 1920, Joughin moved permanently to the United States to Paterson, New Jersey. According to his obituary he was also on board the SS Oregon when it sank in Boston Harbor. He also served on ships operated by the American Export Lines, as well as on World War II troop transports before retiring in 1944.Mr Charles John Joughin ‚Äì General Information, Encyclopedia Titanica. Retrieved on 22 January 2012. After moving back to New Jersey, he remarried to Mrs. Annie Eleanor (Ripley) Howarth Coll (born 29 December, 1870), a native of Leeds, who had first come to the USA in 1888. Annie was a widow twice over and had a daughter, Rose (born 1891), who later married Henry Stoehr. Annie's death in 1943 was a great loss from which he never recovered. Twelve years later, Joughin was invited to describe his experiences in a chapter of Walter Lord's book, A Night to Remember. Soon afterwards, his health rapidly declined. He died in a Paterson hospital on 9 December 1956 at the age of 78, after two weeks with pneumonia, and was buried alongside his wife in the Cedar Lawn Cemetery, in Paterson, New Jersey.  In popular culture  Joughin was portrayed by George Rose in A Night to Remember, and by Liam Tuohy in the 1997 blockbuster Titanic. Joughin was also portrayed by Chris Parnell in the fourth-season premiere of Drunk History in 2016, and again by Stuart Lutes in the second season of the British version in the same year.

Grant Major General (Dr.) David Norvell Walker Grant (May 14, 1891 ‚Äì August 15, 1964), Medical Corps, U.S. Army Air Forces, is considered by most authorities as the \\"grandfather\\" of the present-day U.S. Air Force Medical Service. Born, raised, and educated in Virginia, General Grant received his M.D. from the University of Virginia in 1915. He entered the Army Medical Service in 1916 as a First Lieutenant. During World War I he served in Panama and various stations in the United States. From 1919 to 1922 he served with the Army of Occupation in Germany. After other medical tours of duty, he attended the School of Aviation Medicine Headquarters in 1931. He was stationed at Randolph Field, Texas for the following five years. He later attended the Air Force Tactical School and the Chemical Warfare School. In 1939 he became Chief of the Medical Division, Office of the Chief of the Air Corps. Upon reorganization of the Army in 1941, he was appointed Air Surgeon of the Army Air Forces and visited all fronts during World War II. Prior to World War II, General Grant recognized that the medical needs of a combat air force differed significantly from those of massed land armies. He successfully fought for the establishment of a separate medical service for the Army Air Forces. He became the first Air Surgeon for the United States Army Air Forces and served in that capacity throughout World War II. Because of his vision, forcefulness, and administrative ability in that position, the medical service of the Army Air Force effectively supported the Army Air Force mission during World War II and embodied the potential necessary for peacetime service. General Grant was one of the first to recognize the potentialities of aeromedical evacuation and was directly responsible for its organization and operation in World War II. He was instrumental in the establishment of a convalescent rehabilitation program which helped to restore many of the sick and wounded of World War II to maximum capacity for further service or return to civilian life. His encouragement of aeromedical research resulted in the development of many items of modern high altitude equipment used for the protection of flying personnel. He supervised and directed the forerunner of our present aircrew selection and classification systems and is credited with the establishment of the Physiological Training Program. After a distinguished thirty-three year military career, General Grant retired in 1946 and became Medical Director for the American Red Cross and National Director of the Red Cross Blood Program. General Grant was a recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal and held numerous military and civilian medical honors. General Grant died August 15, 1964. Nearly two years later, on July 1, 1966 the USAF Hospital at Travis AFB, California was officially renamed the David Grant USAF Medical Center during a dedication ceremony held in his honor.

It was a redesign of the Maschinengewehr 08 machine gun (itself an adaptation of the Maxim gun) system intended for use on aircraft and zeppelins, that used a toggle action that broke upwards rather than downwards opposite the MG 08, making for a much more compact receiver. The fusee spring was dispensed with for an internal spring design, the breech block was completely different and the spent cartridges dropped out the bottom of the receiver, rather than being ejected forward through a hole under the breech from the receiver. There appears to be no action or receiver parts interchangeable with the MG 08. The MG 08's belt- style ammunition feed was enclosed in a drum, the recoil casing was lightened and the cooling jacket was modified for air- instead of water-cooling.

The MG 14 was used with the first version of the pioneering Fokker Stangensteuerung synchronizer on the five Fokker M.5K/MG pre-production prototypes for the Fokker E.I, but as the limited supplies of the weapon were more urgently needed for observers in reconnaissance aircraft and defensive gunners aboard Zeppelins and heavier-than-air bombers - as well as its temperamental nature as used on the M.5K/MG, as noted by Otto ParschauGrosz, Peter M., Windsock Datafile No. 91, Fokker E.I/II, Albatros Publications, Ltd. 2002.

The belts can be readily identified by two grommets (instead of three for the wider MG 08 and MG 08/15 belts used by ground forces) and the lack of extended brass tab (also used by the MG 08 and MG 08/15 ground guns). This not only reduced weight and bulk but it also allowed for much lighter and smaller empty belt chutes that came out of all LMG 08's and LMG 08/15's and led down into storage bins in the aircraft. At least three versions survive, a water cooled, an air cooled and a 14/17 version with a 3x telescopic sight.Williams (2003), p. 19 References * Williams, Anthony G. and Emmanuel Gustin.

Life and work Born probably in Venice, he was the pupil of his father, the leading engraver and painter Giulio Campagnola. He appears to have been adopted by his father as a young boy.Jay A. Levinson (ed.) Early Italian Engravings from the National Gallery of Art, pp 410-436 National Gallery of Art, Washington (Catalogue), 1973, LOC 7379624 His grandfather, Girolamo Campagnola was a famous humanist and painter in Padua (end of the 15th century). He was presumably trained initially by his father, and may also have been a pupil of Titian, with whose workshop he was clearly associated. Much of his early painting may be of landscape backgrounds in Titians. He is mainly remembered for his prints and his drawings, especially of landscapes. In his lifetime he was a successful painter, mostly in Padua (Giulio's home town), where he was mainly based from the early 1520s onwards, until his death there in 1564.ULAN Mostly he painted on walls, including decorative schemes, but portraits and landscapes are also attributed to him. His works as a painter are not highly regarded by modern art historians though some landscapes are of high quality. His engravings, fourteen of which are known, were produced in a short burst in 1517-18, when he was still in his teens; most are dated 1517. On some his name appears in full, on others, abbreviated \\"Do.Cap\\" or \\"Do.Camp.\\" (for \\"Domenico Campagnola\\"). He appears to have cut his own blocks for his woodcuts, using a very different style from the professional cutters most artists employed. Like his father he was a versatile and experimental artist. His landscape drawings were produced as finished products for sale; he was one of the first artists to do this. He may have included etching on some plates, including the Old soldier and shepherd. Massacre of the Innocents, woodcut in two blocks His most successful prints include his Old soldier and shepherd , his Battle of naked men, and his Assumption. One engraving appears to have been begun by his father and completed by Domenico, perhaps after his father died. He fell out seriously with Titian, perhaps as a result of the sharp practice which Peter Dreyer has discovered in recent years; it is thought to be Domenico who took very faint counter-proof impressions of some Titian woodcuts, which were then worked over in ink and passed off as Titian's preliminary drawings.David Landau in Jane Martineau (ed), The Genius of Venice, 1500-1600, p. 305, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London. This may well have played a part in bringing to an end Titian's first period of serious interest in making prints based on his work; it was to be some decades before he began collaborating with Cornelius Cort in producing engravings. None of Campagnola's engravings are direct renderings of paintings by Titian, but many are similar in composition, though very different in handling, even allowing for the difference in medium. Many drawings long considered by Titian are now thought to be by Domenico, and attribution of many is still disputed, as some earlier drawings are disputed between his father Giulio, Titian, and Giorgione. Drawings have also been reattributed from Domenico to Giulio Campagnola.See for example no. D9 on p.251 of The Genius of Venice op cit (Three Philosophers in a Landscape, Lugt Collection, Paris) He began by closely following the style of his father and Titian in producing landscapes with figures, but produced larger numbers, and made them directly for sale, so that it is largely through him that this influential typology became widely known. According to James Byam Shaw:\\"In later drawings, Campagnola debased this style of landscape into a kind of facile mannerism; nevertheless he furnished inspiration for Italian draughtsmen for generations to come, including ... Agostino and Annibale Carracci, and Domenichino and Grimaldi later still.\\"The Genius of Venice op cit, p 243. Surviving paintings Most of his paintings have been destroyed. Fresco paintings are to be seen in the Scuola del Santo at Padua and in Venice, marked by fresh animated colour and easy brilliant technique. These are sometimes also attributed to his father. A fine panel picture by him representing Adam and Eve is in the Pitti Palace, Florence.

In 1844, he became director of the Leipzig Heilanstalt (sanatorium). His publications predominantly dealt with the subject of children's health and the social consequences of urbanization at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. * Die Eigenth√ºmlichkeiten des kindlichen Organismus im gesunden und kranken Zustande (1839), literally: \\"Peculiarities of the child's organism in health and illness\\" * Der Hausfreund als Erzieher und F√ºhrer zu Familiengl√ºck und Menschenveredelung (1861), \\"The friend of the family as an educator and leader to family happiness and human refinement\\" * Die √§rztliche Zimmergymnastik (1855), \\"Medical indoor gymnastics\\", his best selling piece of work Remedial exercises Contemporary depiction of remedial exercises Schreber advocated both his \\"systematic remedial exercises\\" and countryside exercise for urban youth. During his time, the term Volksgesundheit (people's health) was coined. Back then, it comprised the idea of a \\"healthy relief of excessive energy\\", as Schreber rigidly opposed masturbation and even experimented with mechanical devices to prevent it in adolescents (see below). Due to the limited success of these methods, he demanded playgrounds out of town, as urban housing had too little space for children to move about. Allotment gardens Schreber was the founder of the eponymous \\"Schreber movement\\", although that term was used only after his death. In 1864, Leipzig school principal Ernst Innozenz Hauschild established the first Schrebergarten, the German term for what are known in English as allotments or community gardens, by leasing land for the physical exercise of children. Poisonous pedagogy One of his sons, Daniel Paul Schreber, wrote an autobiographical account of what is now assumed to have been paranoid psychosis (a term not coined back then), Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (original German title Denkw√ºrdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken). The notes were later analysed by Sigmund Freud on the theoretical basis of psychoanalysis. Two other children of Schreber also suffered from mental disease. One of them, his oldest son Daniel Gustav Schreber, committed suicide. According to Alice Miller, Schreber was a foremost figure of what she called poisonous pedagogy, in a translation of Katharina Rutschky's term Schwarze P√§dagogik (literally: black pedagogy). Miller analysed the social impact of this rigid attitude towards child rearing and pedagogy. Miller wrote in this context: \\"The father of the paranoid patient Schreber whom Freud described, had written several educational books, which were so successful in Germany that some of them were reprinted forty times and translated into several languages.\\" The influence of this pedagogy on Daniel Paul Schreber has also been analyzed by Morton Schatzman (Soul Murder: Persecution in the Family (), 1974) and other authors.

This may be a form of plagiarism and can, in some cases, be copyright infringement. A comic who is known to steal jokes may be labelled with the epithet \\"hack\\" by other comics. A \\"hack comic\\" uses material that is unoriginal or which is blatantly copied from its original author. Some cases of alleged joke theft are ambiguous, due to the possibility of simultaneous and coincidental discovery. Some comics have defended their re-use of other people's jokes as satire or as a calque (word- for-word translation). Other comics have claimed that their re-use was a type of \\"borrowing\\". History=Vaudeville years= In music halls and vaudeville, it was common for performers to \\"borrow\\" material. According to Milton Berle, etiquette only required that \\"the borrower add to the joke and make it his own\\".Berle, Milton (1989) Private joke file, Introduction, p. xxiii, quotation: At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian. Berle and Bob Hope had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes. Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title \\"The Thief of Bad Gag\\". Even the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. Bill Cosby admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase \\"little tiny hairs\\". Many years later, Carlos Mencia performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album Bill Cosby: Himself. =1970s= In the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke. Several comics accused Robin Williams of stealing their material. David Brenner claimed that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes. =1990s= For many years, Denis Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album No Cure For Cancer, he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result. At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude. As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from pancreatic cancer, an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; \\"Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer\\"). In a 2008 appearance on The Opie and Anthony Show, comedian Louis C.K. claimed that Leary stole his \\"I'm an asshole\\" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary. On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co- wrote the song with Chris Phillips. In his memoir Gasping for Airtime, Jay Mohr admitted that he lifted an entire routine from Rick Shapiro's act for a 1995 Saturday Night Live sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation. =2000s and 2010s= Louis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with Dane Cook over three bits on Cook's album, Retaliation, that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album Live in Houston. C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series Louie. George Lopez has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism. However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it. Amy Schumer has been accused of using other people's jokes on her specials and on her sketch comedy show; Patrice O'Neal, Jenny Slate, and Ellen DeGeneres, amongst others, and went so far as to tell Ellen's own joke while Schumer was a guest on DeGeneres' show. In France, many famous stand-up comedians (Gad Elmaleh, Jamel Debbouze, Tomer Sisley, Didier Bourdon, Malik Bentalha, Mickael Quiroga, Yacine Belhousse, , Michel Leeb, , R√©mi Gaillard, Roland Magdane, Michael Youn, Mathieu Mad√©nian, Olivier de Benoist) have been accused of plagiarism by the Facebook/Twitter/YouTube account CopyComic. In 2011, Australia's Got Talent contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals.Waters, G 2011, 'Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip- off comic exposed', Brisbane Times 26 May 2011 However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians Lee Mack and Geoff Keith. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well ‚Äì \\"I just sacked my two writers ‚Äì Copy and Paste\\" ‚Äì had been done in 2009 by comedian Jeffrey Ross, about Brad Garrett, at a roast of Joan Rivers. Ross had said, \\"This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste.\\"Nancarrow, D 2011, 'Oops. He did it again: Rip-off comic plunders joke about plagiarism', Brisbane Times, 29 June 2010, In January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the social networking site Facebook for stealing jokes and stories from comedian Doug Stanhope and posting them to his blog from 2010, claiming them as his own work, including Stanhope's \\"Fuck someone uglier than you\\" routine, which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg. Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostituteSicko (album) nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details, causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the \\"Occupy Troy Holm\\" Movement. Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that \\"To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that isn't mine?\\" As part of his website Stewart Lee hosts Plagiarists Corner where he cites examples from Jack Whitehall, Ricky Gervais, Clint Eastwood using material similar to his own. In the 2010s, the widespread use of video camera-equipped smartphones led to an increase in unauthorized recordings of live comedy shows, some of which were shared online, which may have facilitated joke theft. Some comedians request that no unathorized audio or video recordings be made of their shows to reduce joke theft. In other media Joke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media. Dick Cavett wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by Earl Wilson which attributed the joke to Rip Taylor. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics. Cavett and Woody Allen often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows The Red Skelton Show and Laugh In. quotation: Several episodes of The Simpsons, including \\"Missionary: Impossible\\", \\"Treehouse of Horror XIII\\" and \\"The Italian Bob\\" have poked fun at Family Guy, implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from The Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows. In 2017 the Australian television show host Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme The Grill Team, which is on 2MMM. In the interview, The Grill Teams co-host Matty Johns told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game Test Match. Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme The Kyle and Jackie O Show, which is on KIIS 106.5. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about Test Match, passing it off as his own. Recourse and consequences There is, historically, very little legal recourse taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. W. C. Fields reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken. \\"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy,\\" said comedian David Brenner. \\"If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere ‚Äì and what I just said is original.\\" According to a 2018 study in the American Sociological Review, \\"most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous, owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery,\\" and it observes that accusations of joke theft can reflect peers' perceptions of a suspicious comic's membership in the stand-up community and overall craft as much as the similarity between jokes. Transcreation In 2014, an academic paper called transcreation a literary technique used by Italian comedian Daniele Luttazzi, one of the most corrosive and influential Italian stand-up comedians (in 2002 he was among the targets of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Editto Bulgaro): Luttazzi adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. For example, in March 2012 Luttazzi won a legal battle against La7 broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show \\"Decameron\\", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation. He calls this ruse \\"the Lenny Bruce trick\\" (named for the comic of same name). In 2010, a smear campaign accused him of plagiarism , but, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a \\"nugget\\" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a \\"treasure hunt\\". Luttazzi also calls the charges \\"naive\\", explaining why those jokes are not \\"plagiarized\\", but \\"calqued\\", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context. Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.

I don‚Äôt approve at all of what he‚Äôs doing, and I would appreciate it when you do the article it would be a very, very important and fantastic thing - I‚Äôm not trying to tell you what to do - but if you could somewhere mention to NOT BUY ANYTHING from him. A lot of this stuff has crap sound quality and originally he had permission to do only 500 copies of one LP and that that was the PENTAGRAM-1972-1979 LP . I haven‚Äôt received not one cent from any of the numerous Pentagram products he has released.‚Äù \\" Most of the material was later released by Relapse Records on the First Daze Here and First Daze Here Too compilations. The mix of \\"Smokescreen\\" included on the 1972-1979 LP is different from the version included on the Relapse compilations and was not released on any other compilation after 1993.

It is situated approximately south of Withernsea town centre and east of the village of Patrington. It lies just inland from the North Sea coast. According to the 2011 UK Census, Holmpton parish had a population of 228, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 193. The parish church of St Nicholas is a Grade II listed building. The Greenwich Prime Zero meridian line passes through the parish. In 1823, Holmpton was a parish in the Wapentake of Holderness. The patronage of the parish church was under the King. Population at the time was 256. Occupations included eight farmers, two wheelwrights, a blacksmith, two tailors, a milliner, a shoemaker, a shopkeeper, and the landlord of The Board public house. There was also a schoolmaster, a curate, and a gentleman. A carrier operated between the village and Hull twice weekly. History Holmpton is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Homletone, which is a mixture of Old Norse and Old English, holmr-t≈´n (island farmstead or village). Like many other locations on the Holderness Coast, the village is subject to coastal erosion. A measurement in the 19th century determined that the church was only from the sea; it was away in 1786; a loss of in less than 50 years. The road to the north connecting Holmpton to Withernsea, is also under threat of coastal erosion, with the belief that the road could disappear during a hard winter. The pub in the village, The George and Dragon, closed down in 2017. It was previously the subject of a closure application in 1926 for religious reasons, but it was kept open as a place to look after the survivors of shipwrecks on that part of the coast. RAF Holmpton The village is home to RAF Holmpton, built originally as an early warning radar station, and now refurbished to act as museum and archive. Royal Air Force Holmpton is still a part of the RAF and the Defence Estate (2009). It currently hosts a Public Exhibition and is also home to the Defence Archives Unit. RAF Holmpton is managed by HIPPO, an Independent Finance Initiative. The site runs to about and consists of a number of surface structures along with a secure command bunker which is about below ground. The bunker was first built in 1951-3 and started life as an early Warning Station (part of the ROTOR programme). In the late 1960s it became a Master Comprehensive Radar Station which eventually closed in 1974. The part of the site used for training was converted in the 1980s to form the new War HQ for RAF Support Command. With the ending of the Cold War this function ceased in 1991 and the site returned to training until the late 1990s when it was rebuilt to become the 1st experimental HQ of the new CCIS Electronic Warfare System. This function left the site in 2000-01\\\\. In 2003 Defence Archives moved to the site and in 2004 the first public exhibition opened. The exhibition opens throughout the year to visitors and 75% of the bunker is included in the visit, apart from AREA 7 which remains classified.Information provided by HIPPO at RAF Holmpton 2009. Second World War Holmpton Memorial, 7 November 2009 On 14 January 1942 at 20.44, a Royal Air Force Avro Manchester bomber crashed on Mill Hill south of the village of Holmpton. The plane was seen with the port engine on fire with flames extending back past the tail. It struck the hill and exploded on impact killing all seven crew members on board. The plane was Avro Manchester L7523 EM:M of No. 207 Squadron RAF stationed at RAF Bottesford in Leicestershire. It had been charged with attacking the Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg. The plane was delayed on take-off due to an unknown technical issue and eventually headed for the North Sea some time behind the rest of the squadron. The time of flight, and speed of the Manchester, doesn't allow the aircraft to have reached Hamburg and it is most likely to have reached the Dutch Frisian Islands before returning home, either hit by the enemy or very likely a mechanical failure which was common with the Avro Manchester. A memorial to the crew of the aircraft was dedicated in November 2009 in the grounds of St Nicholas church in Holmpton.

Children may go through a range of experiences that classify as psychological trauma, these might include neglect, abandonment, sexual abuse, and physical abuse, parent or sibling is treated violently or there is a parent with a mental illness. These events have profound psychological, physiological, and sociological impacts and can have negative, lasting effects on health and well-being. Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 1998 study on adverse childhood experiences determined that traumatic experiences during childhood are a root cause of many social, emotional, and cognitive impairments that lead to increased risk of unhealthy self-destructive behaviors, risk of violence or re-victimization, chronic health conditions, low life potential and premature mortality. As the number of adverse experiences increases, the risk of problems from childhood through adulthood also rises. Nearly 30 years of study following the initial study has confirmed this. Many states, health providers, and other groups now routinely screen parents and children for ACEs.  Health outcomes  Lasting effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences Traumatic experiences during childhood causes stress that increases an individual's allostatic load and thus affects the immune system, nervous system, and endocrine system. Childhood trauma is often associated with adverse health outcomes including depression, hypertension, autoimmune diseases, lung cancer, and premature mortality. Effects of childhood trauma on brain development includes a negative impact on emotional regulation and impairment of development of social skills. Research has shown that children raised in traumatic or risky family environments tend to have excessive internalizing (e.g., social withdrawal, anxiety) or externalizing (e.g., aggressive behavior), and suicidal behavior. Recent research has found that physical and sexual abuse are associated with mood and anxiety disorders in adulthood, while personality disorders and schizophrenia are linked with emotional abuse as adults. = Psychological impact= Childhood trauma can increase the risk of mental disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attachment issues, depression, and substance abuse. Sensitive and critical stages of child development can result in altered neurological functioning, adaptive to a malevolent environment but difficult for more benign environments. In a study done by Stefania Tognin and Maria Calem comparing healthy comparisons (HC) and individuals at clinically high risk for developing psychosis (CHR), 65.6% CHR patients and 23.1% HC experienced some level of childhood trauma. The conclusion of the study shows that there is a correlation between the effects of childhood trauma and the being at high risk for psychosis. = Epigenetics = Child abuse can leave tracks, not only physically and emotionally, but also in the form of epigenetic marks on a child's genes. Although these epigenetic marks do not cause mutations in the DNA itself, the chemical modifications-including DNA methylation-change gene expression by silencing (or activating) genes. This can alter fundamental biological processes and adversely affect health outcomes throughout life. A 2013 study found that people who had experienced childhood trauma had different neuropathology than people with PTSD from trauma experienced after childhood. Another recent study in rhesus macaques showed that DNA methylation changes related to early-life adversity persisted into adulthood. The theoretical link between exposure to extreme stress and the development of PTSD provided the rationale for early hypotheses that PTSD-related biological alterations would be similar in direction to those observed acutely in animals exposed to stressors. When subsequent findings indicated that only a minority of trauma-exposed individuals develop PTSD, an alternative hypothesis was generated proposing that PTSD involves a failure of mechanisms involved in recovery and restitution of physiological homeostasis, possibly resulting from individualistic predisposition. Translational studies of PTSD are the use of a developmental neurobiological approach, spanning across the entire course of the illness. Symptom severity in PTSD can wax and wane over several decades. Biological alterations reflecting risk rather than pathophysiology may not account for this phenomenon. On the other hand, even putative risk factors such as glucocorticoid responsiveness and hippocampal volume show changes in response to factors such as environmental exposures, duration of illness, comorbidity, and aging. Thus, it is important to understand whether risk factors influence, or are influenced by, other parameters associated with PTSD (Yehuda, and LeDooux, 2007). In 2006, a study was published explaining that the effect of maternal PTSD symptoms related to cortisol has been shown to be associated with infant cortisol levels as early as the first year of life, and may be associated with in utero effects of maternal stress Indeed. infants of mothers who developed PTSD in response to direct exposure to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks showed decreased salivary cortisol levels early in life, compared to infants of WTC-exposed mothers who did not develop PTSD. This effect was most apparent in infants whose mothers were exposed during their third trimester of pregnancy. Their findings suggest that mothers with a greater susceptibility for developing PTSD may produce infants who are more easily distressed by novelty than are infants of mothers who are less prone to develop PTSD. Alternatively, mothers who more readily develop PTSD may perceive and then rate their infants as having generally negative temperaments. This was not the case, however, because these mothers only rated their infants as having greater distress to novelty but not as having other negative temperamental traits. The extent to which the behavioral changes in offspring persist is an important area for future inquiry (Brand, Engel, Canfield, and Yehuda, 2006). In this sense parental trauma exposure is associated with greater risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mood and anxiety disorders in offspring since biological alterations associated with PTSD and/or other stress-related disorders have also been observed in offspring of trauma survivors who do not themselves report trauma exposure or psychiatric disorder. Animal models have demonstrated that stress exposure can result in epigenetic alterations in the next generation, and such mechanisms have been hypothesized to underpin vulnerability to symptoms in offspring of trauma survivors. Enduring behavioral responses to stress and epigenetic alterations in adult offspring have been demonstrated to be mediated by changes in gametes in utero effects, variations in early postnatal care, and/or other early life experiences that are influenced by parental exposure (Yehuda, Daskalakis, Bierer, Bader, Klengel, Holsboer, and Binder, 2015). Survivors of war trauma or childhood maltreatment are at increased risk for trauma-spectrum disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, traumatic stress has been associated with alterations in the neuroendocrine and the immune system, enhancing the risk for physical diseases. Traumatic experiences might even affect psychological as well as biological parameters in the next generation, i.e. traumatic stress might have trans generational effects. So currently there is a new field trying to explain how epigenetic processes, which represent a pivotal biological mechanism for dynamic adaptation to environmental challenges, might contribute to the explanation of the long-lasting and intergenerational effects of trauma. In particular, epigenetic alterations in genes regulating the hypothalamus‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis as well as the immune system have been observed in survivors of childhood and adult trauma. These changes could result in enduring alterations of the stress response as well as the physical health risk. Furthermore, the effects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next generation by parental distress and the pre- and postnatal environment, as well as by epigenetic marks transmitted via the germline. While epigenetic research has a high potential of advancing our understanding of the consequences of trauma, the findings have to be interpreted with caution, as epigenetics only represent one piece of a complex puzzle of interacting biological and environmental factors (Ramo-Fern√°ndez, Schneider, Wilker, Kolassa, 2015). An example of this was the study led by Yehuda, Daskalakis, Bierer, Bader, Klengel, Holsboer and Binder, 2015), that studied Holocaust survivors and their offspring have methylation changes on the same site in a functional intronic region of the FKBP5 gene, a GR-binding sequence in intron 7, but in the opposite direction these results provide the first demonstration of an association of pre-conception stress effects with epigenetic changes in both exposed parents and their offspring in adult humans. Bin 3/site 6 methylation was not associated with the FKBP5 risk allele and could not be attributed to the offspring's own trauma exposure, their own psychopathology, or other examined characteristics that might independently affect methylation of this gene. Yet, it could be attributed to Holocaust exposure in the F0, with this their data support an intergenerational epigenetic priming of the physiological response to stress in offspring of highly traumatized individuals. These changes may contribute to the increased risk for psychopathology in the F1 generation. Two sites anticipated to operate similarly to regulate FKBP5 gene expression were demonstrated to have different environmental influences. The mechanism of intergenerational transmission of epigenetic effects at bin 3/site 6 is not known but does not appear to be mediated by childhood adversity, as is the case for bin 2. From a biological perspective, accommodation to multiple environmental influences at distinct and potentially redundant sites on genes central to stress regulation would facilitate maximal stress responsively and adaptation. Future studies should focus on assessing the effects of trauma at various developmental stages, as well as potential differences in maternal and paternal effects. Additionally, the mechanism of intergenerational transmission of trauma and functional importance of site specificity remain to be explored. Early detection of such epigenetic marks may advance the development of preventive strategies to address the intergenerational sequel of exposure to trauma. As it has been said Cytosine methylation of glucocorticoid related genes represents an epigenetic modification thought to underlie the developmental programming of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. The importance of epigenetic studies offer promise as diagnostic or prognostic markers, but it is not known whether these measures associate with, or predict, clinical state. These questions were addressed in a pilot study with combat veterans with PTSD to determine whether cytosine methylation in promoter regions of the glucocorticoid related NR3C1 and FKBP51 genes would predict or associate with treatment outcome. This is because Plasticity of the epigenome appears to constitute a molecular mechanism whereby genetic predispositions may be influenced by environmental exposures resulting in sustained alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis Epigenetic modifications of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene promoter were first described in the rat as a mechanism by which variations in parent ‚Äì offspring interactions influence HPA-axis and behavioural responses to stress. Maternal care regulates the methylation state of the GR exon 17 promoter in hippocampus, which in turn, regulates GR expression, the capacity for glucocorticoid negative feedback, and HPA-axis responses to stress (5, 7). Subsequent studies in humans showed that childhood adversity associates with higher methylation of the GR exon 1F promoter (the human ortholog of the rat exon 17 promoter sequence) lower hippocampal GR expression and increased HPA- axis responses to stress. The examination of biological measures in association with PTSD symptom change following an efficacious psychotherapy trial was designed to yield a sample with a variable degree of symptom improvement, with some showing large decreases in symptom severity, and others, minimal or moderate change. An additional advantage of this approach is the ability to modify symptoms without introducing exogenousmedications that might have direct effects on the biological measures of interest. (Yehuda, Daskalakis, Desarnaud, Makotkine, Lehrner, Koch, Flory, Buxbaum, Meaney, and Bierer, 2013; Yahyavi, Zarghami, Marwah, 2014). Epidemiologic research has clarified risk factors that increase the likelihood of PTSD after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. PTSD is an interaction between a subject, a traumatogenic factor and a social context. With each epidemiological, psychopathological and more particularly neurogenetic study, we will expand on the impact of these interactions on the therapeutic treatment of psycho-traumatized persons (Uux√©m√©ry, 2012).  Socioeconomic costs  The social and economic costs of child abuse and neglect are difficult to calculate. Some costs are straightforward and directly related to maltreatment, such as hospital costs for medical treatment of injuries sustained as a result of physical abuse and foster care costs resulting from the removal of children when they cannot remain safely with their families. Other costs, less directly tied to the incidence of abuse, include lower academic achievement, adult criminality, and lifelong mental health problems. Both direct and indirect costs impact society and the economy.  Transgenerational effects People can pass their epigenetic marks including de-myelinated neurons to their children. The effects of trauma can be transferred from one generation of childhood trauma survivors to subsequent generations of offspring. This is known as transgenerational trauma or intergenerational trauma, and can manifest in parenting behaviors as well as epigenetically. Exposure to childhood trauma, along with environmental stress, can also cause alterations in genes and gene expressions. A growing body of literature suggests that children's experiences of trauma and abuse within close relationships not only jeopardize their well-being in childhood, but can also have long-lasting consequences that extend well into adulthood. These long-lasting consequences can include emotion regulation issues, which can then be passed onto subsequent generations through child-parent interactions and learned behaviors. (see also behavioral epigenetics, epigenetics, historical trauma, and cycle of violence)  Resilience Exposure to maltreatment in childhood significantly predicts a variety of negative outcomes in adulthood. However, not all children who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event develop subsequent struggles with mental or physical health. Therefore, there are factors that reduce the impact of potentially traumatic events and protect an individual from developing mental health problems after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. These are called resiliency factors. Research regarding children who showed adaptive development while facing adversity began in the 1970s and continues to this day. Resilience is defined as ‚Äúthe process of, capacity for, or outcome of successful adaptation despite challenging or threatening circumstances.\\" The concept of resilience stems from research that showed experiencing positive emotions had a restorative and preventive effect on the experience of negative emotions more broadly with regards to physical and psychological wellbeing in general and more specifically with reactions to trauma. This line of research has contributed to the development of interventions that focus on promoting resilience as opposed to focusing on deficits in an individual who has experienced a traumatic event. Resilience has been found to decrease risk of suicide, depression, anxiety and other mental health struggles associated with exposure to trauma in childhood. When an individual who is high in resilience experiences a potentially traumatic event, their relative level of functioning does not significantly deviate from the level of functioning they exhibited prior to exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Furthermore, that same individual may recover more quickly and successfully from a potentially traumatic experience than an individual who could be said to be less resilient. In children, level of functioning is operationalized as the child continuing to behave in a manner that is considered developmentally appropriate for a child of that age. Level of functioning is also measured by the presence of mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and so on. = Factors that affect resilience = Factors that affect resilience include cultural factors like socioeconomic status, such that having more resources at one's disposal usually equates to more resilience to trauma. Furthermore, the severity and duration of the potentially traumatic experience affect the likelihood of experiencing negative outcomes as a result of childhood trauma. One factor that does not affect resilience is gender, with both males and females being equally sensitive to risk and protective factors. Cognitive ability is also not a predictor of resilience. Attachment has been shown to be one of the most important factors to consider when it comes to evaluating the relative resilience of an individual. Children with secure attachments to an adult with effective coping strategies were most likely to endure adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in an adaptive manner. Secure attachments throughout the lifespan (including in adolescence and adulthood) appear to be equally important in fostering and maintaining resilience. Secure attachment to one's peers throughout adolescence is a particularly strong predictor of resilience. Within the context of abuse, it is thought that these secure attachments decrease the extent to which children who are abused perceive others as being untrustworthy. In other words, while some children who are abused might begin to view other people as being unsafe and unable to be trusted, children who are able to develop and maintain healthy relationships are less likely to hold these views. Children who experience trauma but also experience healthy attachment with multiple groups of people (in essence, adults, peers, romantic partners, etc.) throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood are particularly resilient. Personality also affects the development (or lack of development) of adult psychopathology as a result of childhood abuse. Individuals who scored low in neuroticism exhibit fewer negative outcomes, such as psychopathology, criminal activity, and poor physical health, after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. Furthermore, individuals with higher scores on openness to experience, conscientiousness, and extraversion have been found to be more resilient to the effects of childhood trauma. = Enhancing resilience = One of the most common misconceptions about resilience is that individuals who show resilience are somehow special or extraordinary in some way. Successful adaptation, or resilience, is quite common among children. This is due in part to the naturally adaptive nature of childhood development. Therefore, resilience is enhanced by protecting against factors that might undermine a child's inborn resilience. Studies suggest that resiliency can be enhanced by providing children who have been exposed to trauma with environments in which they feel safe and are able to securely attach to a healthy adult. Therefore, interventions that promote strong parent-child bonds are particularly effective at buffering against the potential negative effects of trauma. Furthermore, researchers of resilience argue that successful adaptation is not merely an end result but rather a developmental process that is ongoing throughout a person's lifetime. Thus, successful promotion of resilience must also be ongoing throughout a person's lifespan.  Prognosis Trauma affects all children differently (see stress in early childhood). Some children who experience trauma develop significant and long-lasting problems, while others may have minimal symptoms and recover more quickly. Studies have found that despite the broad impacts of trauma, children can and do recover, and that trauma-informed care and interventions produce better outcomes than ‚Äútreatment as usual‚Äù. Trauma-informed care is defined as offering services or support in a way that addresses the special needs of people who have experienced trauma.  Types= Medical trauma = Medical trauma, sometimes called \\"pediatric medical traumatic stress\\" refers to a set of psychological and physiological responses of children and their families to pain, injury, serious illness, medical procedures, and invasive or frightening treatment experiences. Medical trauma may occur as a response to a single or multiple medical events. = Separation trauma = Separation trauma is a disruption in an attachment relationship that disrupts neurological development and can lead to death. Chronic separation from a caregiver can be extremely traumatic to a child.  Treatment  The effects of childhood trauma can be mitigated through care and treatment. Early intervention has significant impact. Trauma-informed treatment modalities treat the whole person, recognizing the impact of trauma on physical, psychological, and social health. Reducing stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline, testosterone) is a vital early step for effective treatment of complex childhood trauma. At the present time, the evolving standard of care for the treatment of PTSD includes psychotherapy supplemented by psychopharmacology, where appropriate and used to relieve posttraumatic symptoms as well as associated symptoms of depression, anxiety, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and, on occasion, psychosis, carefully applied according to the needs of the client. This is particular important because the overall cost of mental illness to the U.S. economy is staggering, with a 2008 report estimating costs over $300 billion, both the direct costs of mental health care and indirect costs including loss of income from unemployment (McCall-Hosenfield, Mukherjee, Lehman, 2014). Despite demonstrated effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there is limited research on the trajectory of PTSD symptom change during the course of these therapies. In addition, existent findings are mixed, making it difficult to know how individuals‚Äô PTSD symptoms will change from week to week during psychotherapy (Schumm, Jeremiah, Kristen, Chard, 2013). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the psychological treatment of choice for PTSD and is recommended by best- practice treatment guidelines e.g. CBT typically involves confrontation with, and processing of, the trauma memory in a safe, gradual manner; identification and restructuring of problematic beliefs; and de-arousal skills. There is strong research evidence for use of these CBT techniques to treat PTSD in terms of magnitude of symptom reduction from pre-treatment levels, and diagnostic recovery. Associated treatment barriers include stigma, cost, geography and insufficient treatment availability (Allen, Newby, Smith and Andrews, 2015). The treatment of CPTSD is cued to the diagnostic criteria that the seven areas of impairment described earlier: (a) alterations in the capacity to regulate emotions, (b) alterations in conscious- ness and identity, (c) alterations in self- perception, (d) alterations in perception of the perpetrator, (e) somatization, (f) alterations in perceptions of others, and (g) alterations in systems of meaning. The treatment approach that is most recommended at the present time is that of a meta-model that encourages careful sequencing of therapeutic activities and tasks, with specific initial attention to the individual's safety and ability to regulate his or her emotional state. By this reason psychopharmacology is another treatment for the related physical‚Äìpsychological symptoms. A need to combine psychopharmacology and psychotherapy is usually recommended, including for CPTSD patients (Van Wesel, Alisic, Boeije, 2014). The clinical relevance of recognizing the existence of complex PTSD in a patient is because the diagnosis is believed to merit a treatment plan that is different from that recommended by treatment guidelines for PTSD in adults (e.g., NICE, 2005). Treatment guidelines for PTSD in adults recommend trauma-focused treatment as a first line intervention for all patients with chronic PTSD. Trauma-focused treatment can be defined as treatment that focuses on \\"the patients' memories of their traumatic events and the personal meanings of the trauma\\". This consists of a first phase that focuses on safety, symptom reduction, and skills training; a second phase that focuses on processing of traumatic memories; and a third phase that focuses on social and psychological (re-) integration. Stand-alone trauma focused treatment is believed to carry a risk of psychologically overwhelming the patient and consequently of psychological de-compensation (Ter Heide, Mooren, Kleber, 2016). A different approach is the Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) which is well-established based on efficacy as well as effectiveness research and widespread acceptance by practicing clinicians, yet its primary benefits over and above community treatment by expert clinicians have been shown to be preventing self-harm and enhancing interpersonal functioning by reducing experiential avoidance and expressed anger (Ford, Courtois, 2014). Structural and content-related features of trauma narratives of traumatic events may help explain the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a sample of 35 female assault survivors, we examined the association between the structure and content of trauma narratives and PTSD and other trauma-related reactions (i.e., depression, anxiety, anger, dissociation, and guilt). When controlling for recounting style and recounting distress, narrative structure was not strongly associated with PTSD or other trauma-related reactions. In contrast, the content of the trauma narratives (more positive and negative emotion words, higher cognitive process, and less self-focus) was associated with lower symptomatology. Taken together, trauma narrative content rather than grammatical structure of the narrative may be more reflective of underlying emotional processing of the traumatic memory or lack thereof (Jaeger, Lindblom, Parker-Guilbert, Zoellner, 2014). Another therapeutic option is the efficacy of Real Life Heroes (RLH) treatment was tested with 119 children in 7 child and family service programs, by (Kagan, James; Trinkle, LaFrenier, (2014), ranging from home-based family counseling to residential treatment. RLH is a sequential, attachment-centered treatment intervention for children with Complex PTSD that focuses on 3 primary components: affect regulation, emotionally supportive relationships, and life story integration to build resources and skills for resilience. Results included statistically significant decreases from baseline to 6 months in child behavior problems on the CBCL (Internalizing and Total Behavior), the Anger subscale of the TSCC, the UCLA PTSD Index-Parent Version (Re-experiencing, Avoidance, Hyper arousal, and Total Symptoms), and the UCLA PTSD Index-Child Version (Avoidance and Total Symptoms). Significant reductions were also found with repeated measures at 3-month assessments from baseline to 9 months on the CBCL, the UCLA Parent and Child Versions, and the PTSD subscale of the TSCC. Children receiving RLH did not have placements or psychiatric hospitalizations, a positive, but not significant trend, compared with trauma-informed \\"treatment as usual\\" provided by RLH-trained practitioners in the same programs. The study supported the efficacy of implementing trauma and resiliency-focused treatment in a wide range of child welfare programs and the importance of providing sequential attachment-centered treatment for children with symptoms of Complex PTSD. The consensus or meta-model that is most in use in the contemporary treatment of CPTSD involves stages of treatment that are organized to address specific issues and skills (Courtois, 2004). A model consisting of three stages is widely adopted, following the recommendation made in Herman's influential and pioneering book on CPTSD, Trauma and Recovery (Herman, 1992). A model similar to this one was originally conceptualized and implemented for the treatment of chronic trauma by the French neurologist, Pierre Janet, at the end of the last century. The early stage of treatment is devoted to the development of the treatment alliance, affect regulation, education, safety, and skill-building. The middle stage, generally undertaken when the client has enough life stability and has learned adequate affect modulation and coping skills, is directed toward the processing of traumatic material in enough detail and to a degree of completion and resolution to allow the individual to function with less posttraumatic impairment. The third stage is targeted toward life consolidation and restructuring, in other words, toward a life that is less affected by the original trauma and its consequences (Courtois, 2004). Research also covers the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among traumatized youth involved with the juvenile justice system. The first section presents the rationale for taking a family systems approach to respond to this problem and describes the ways in which family processes and parent‚Äìchild relationships reciprocally affect one another in the aftermath of traumatic events. The second section outlines the key features of Functional Family Therapy (FFT) and makes the case for why this evidence-based intervention provides firm bedrock upon which to build a targeted trauma- focused adaptation. The third section of the article outlines the FFT-Trauma Focused model and describes the methods of its flexible and individualized implementation with families of traumatized delinquent youth (Kerig, Alexander, 2012). Other option is the Narrative-Emotion Process Coding System (NEPCS) is a behavioral coding system that identifies eight client markers: Abstract Story, Empty Story, Unstoried Emotion, Inchoate Story, Same Old Story, Competing Plotlines Story, Unexpected Outcome Story, and Discovery Story. Each marker varies in the degree to which specific narrative and emotion process indicators are represented in one-minute time segments drawn from videotaped therapy sessions. As enhanced integration of narrative and emotional expression has previously been associated with recovery from complex trauma (Carpenter, Angus, Paivio, Bryntwick, 2015). On the other hand, the Attachment, Self-Regulation, and Competency (ARC) Framework is one of a handful of emerging treatment models being developed in partnership with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) as an intervention for children and adolescents impacted by complex trauma. The ARC framework is a flexible, component-based intervention for treating children and adolescents who have experienced complex trauma. The ARC framework is theoretically grounded in attachment, trauma, and developmental theories and specifically addresses three core domains impacted by exposure to chronic, interpersonal trauma: attachment, self-regulation, and developmental competencies Attachment, self -regulation, competency, trauma experience integration, within those domains, the framework is organized around 10 core targets or building blocks of intervention (Arnsten, Raskind, Taylor, Connor, 2015). Bush, Prins, Laraway, O‚ÄôBrien, Ruzek, Ciulla, (2014) explored in a pilot study a non-concurrent, multiple-baseline single-case design to examine the impact of an online self-management posttraumatic stress (PTS) workshop on self- reported symptoms of PTS, depression, and functional impairment. Eleven student veterans with PTS first completed between three and five weekly baseline measures. Second, they took part in eight weekly online workshop sessions, each accompanied by symptom assessments. Third, they completed post intervention outcome measures. These researchers found statistically significant reductions in PTS from baseline across workshop sessions for four of 11 participants, and significant overall reductions in PTS between enrollment and post intervention for five participants. One participant also demonstrated significantly reduced depressive symptoms from baseline across the intervention, and two evidenced significant overall reductions from enrollment to post intervention. Three student veterans showed significantly improved general functioning across the sessions and one reported significant overall functional increase. Finally, five of six participants who completed extended measures of educational function showed significant improvements from enrollment to post intervention. Among secondary outcomes, more than 80% of those taking part said they would recommend the online PTS workshop to a colleague or fellow student with PTS issues. This gap in services seems particularly unfortunate, in that there are a number of well-established treatments for PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD, in particular those interventions that include exposure therapy, has excellent empirical support in randomized control trials (Frueh, Anouk, Cusack, Kimble, Elhai, Knapp, 2009).  Effects on adults  As an adult feelings of anxiety, worry, shame, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, grief, sadness and anger that started with a trauma in childhood can continue. In addition, those who endure trauma as a child are more likely to encounter anxiety, depression, suicide and self harm, PTSD, drug and alcohol misuse and relationship difficulties. The effects of childhood trauma don't end with just emotional repercussions. Survivors of childhood trauma are also at higher risk of developing asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes or having a stroke. They are also more likely to develop a \\"heightened stress response\\" which can make it difficult for them to regulate their emotions, lead to sleep difficulties, lower immune function, and increase the risk of a number of physical illnesses throughout adulthood.

Critical reception Will Joyner of The New York Times wrote a positive review of the adaptation: \\"Strangely, and to its great credit, this new Far From the Madding Crowd, which was produced by Granada Television in Britain and WGBH-TV in Boston, does not simply survive the viewer's tendency to compare and second-guess; it thrives upon it. At almost every turn of the deliciously gradual tale of romantic chaos, the new version is just as visually striking as the 1967 film -- some of the locations are virtually identical -- and is more naturally rendered dramatically, with a rough language truer to Hardy's blend of poetry and rural speech.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1998 British television series debuts Category:1998 British television series endings Category:1990s British drama television series Category:ITV television dramas Category:1990s romantic drama television series Category:Films based on works by Thomas Hardy Category:1990s British television miniseries Category:Television shows set in England Category:Television shows based on British novels Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Far from the Madding Crowd (1998 film)"},{"id":"10333145","text":"Crispin Beltran, also known as Ka Bel (January 7, 1933 ‚Äì May 20, 2008) was a Filipino labor leader. A staunch critic of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, his imprisonment in 2006 and 2007 on disputed charges of rebellion and sedition drew international attention. He was a member of 13th Congress of the Philippines with the Anakpawis (\\"Toiling Masses\\") party-list and former chair of Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), a militant and progressive labor movement. Labor leader Beltran began his labor career in his 20s when he served as the president of the Yellow Taxi Drivers‚Äô Union and the Amalgamated Taxi Drivers Federation from 1955 to 1963. He served as vice administrator of the Confederation of Labor Unions of the Philippines and was vice president of the Philippine Alliance of Nationalist Organizations from 1963 to 1972. In August 1982 to 1984, he was arrested and detained at Camp Crame, Quezon City, and his 10 children lived on his small earnings from selling rubber slippers and selling fish in the market. Osang delivered his speeches at rallies, and eventually did volunteer work at the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines. In 1984, when KMU president Felixberto Olalia died of pneumonia in his detention cell, Ka Osang successfully planned a daring escape plan amid his kidney ailment, but he endured blows, punches and kicks from his guards. Beltran became a fugitive of justice in Central Luzon, and was protected by insurgents. In 1986 President Corazon Aquino ordered the release of Beltran and of all political prisoners. He joined the party-list elections as a second nominee of Bayan Muna in 2001 and won a seat in the House of Representatives. He won a second term in 2004 and a third term in 2007 as Anakpawis representative. Beltran joined the Kilusang Mayo Uno in 1955. He became the Chairperson of the organization in 1986 following the murder of Rolando Olalia. From 1993 to 1999, Beltran was the Chairperson of BAYAN. Detention and release On February 25, 2006, Beltran was arrested shortly after a state of emergency was declared by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. He was charged with inciting to sedition. He was subsequently implicated in an alleged plot to overthrow the government of Arroyo.Beltran v. People, G.R. No. 175013, 1 June 2007 An international campaign was organized calling for the immediate release of Beltran. One group, the 'Free Ka Bel Movement' has local chapters in Southern Tagalog, Davao and Cebu and international chapters in Hong Kong, Japan, US, Canada, Australia and Switzerland. Some 99 parliamentarians from across the world supported the release of Crispin Beltran coming from 11 countries and 13 parliaments, including the Netherlands, Cambodia, Burma, New Zealand, Belgium, Chile, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the European Parliament, Switzerland, Denmark, and the Flemish Parliament. Beltran also drew support from Keith Locke, MP, Foreign Affairs Critic of the Green Party of New Zealand.Keith Locke MP, \\"Helen Clark should help free Filipino MPs\\", 14 March 2006. Beltran remained in detention until June 2007, when the Supreme Court of the Philippines voided the charges against Beltran and several other leaders affiliated with leftist groups. On January 4, 2008, Beltran filed House Resolution 299 with the House of Representatives of the Philippines to investigate the murders and harassment of trade union / labor leaders in the Philippines. He cited the 2007 annual Survey of Trade Union Rights Violations of the International Trade Union Confederation: \\"33 of the total 144 cases of trade union killings worldwide happened in the Philippines; and 800 cases of beatings and torture of trade unionists in the country.\\"Inquirer.net, Probe killing of labor leaders--Beltran Beltran was hurt in a vehicular accident in October 2007 in Intramuros, Manila, when hisToyota Hi-Ace van was rammed by a Ford Everest sports utility vehicle.

The first of five shows was broadcast by NBC in 1994, and continued with annual editions through 1998. These shows were most often first telecast during the Thanksgiving holidays when special programming would occur.TV Guide information Nov. 1994, Nov. 1995, Nov. 1996 These specials reran occasionally on ABC Family (then The Family Channel and Fox Family) from October 1996 to early 2002. The first episode was hosted by Robert Urich, the second by Alan Thicke, and the final three episodes by John Ritter. All of the specials were narrated by Don LaFontaine. During specials II, III, IV, and V, before each commercial break of every episode, in a segment known as the Mac King School of Magic, Mac King showed viewers a simple magic trick, and would break its steps down after the commercial break so that the audience could perform the same trick for family and friends. The first special featured the same teach-a-trick segments which involved some of the various magicians featured in the special, along with a special guest celebrity. Below is a list of the closing illusions for each of the five shows, and the magicians who performed them: *World's Greatest Magic I: Franz Harary - Space Shuttle vanish *World's Greatest Magic II: Penn and Teller - Magic bullet catch *World's Greatest Magic III: The Pendragons - Disappearance of 25 Vegas showgirls *World's Greatest Magic IV: Lance Burton - Jaws of Death escape (Lance was handcuffed and shackled inside a canvas mailbag, put in the back of a car, and dropped into a car crusher.) *World's Greatest Magic V: Brett Daniels - Teleportation of actress Kelly Packard across the Grand Canyon Featured magicians *The Amazing Johnathan *Anand Joshi *Ayala & Lilia *Bill Malone *Bob Arno *Brett Daniels *David Williamson *Fielding West *Franz Harary *Galina *Greg Frewin *The Hamners *Hans Klok & Sittah *Jean-Pierre Vallarino *Jeff McBride *Joseph Gabriel *Juan Tamariz *Juliana Chen *Lance Burton *Mac King *Magician Ganesh *Max Maven *Melinda Saxe (a.k.a. \\"Melinda, First Lady of Magic\\") *Nathan Burton *Penn and Teller *Peter Marvey *Princess Tenko *Raymond Crowe *Rene Lavand *Sheri Lucas *Steve Wyrick *Tabary *Tom Mullica *Topas Music The producer of this series, Gary Ouellet, released a booklet entitled 'Music for Magicians',http://www.camirandmagic.com/sc_004.html in which the music selection and editing process for this show was explained. Few of the performers could use their regular performance music, because synchronization rights are usually too costly (or sometimes unavailable) for commercial tracks. Two exceptions were Topas from WGM I, who used 'Hello Again' by the Cars, and Jeff McBride, who had music specially written for him by Jordan Rudess.http://www.jordanrudess.com/wp/?page_id=28 Hence, for the first two specials, the performers taped the show using their normal music, and a new audio track had to be created for broadcast, consisting of custom music created for each performer (which resembled their existing music), and a re-creation of the audience applause. In some cases, it was known that the ambient sounds/applause would be important to a particular performer, and those acts were performed without music, so that custom music could be cleanly inserted in post-production.Music for Magicians, Gary Ouellet Prior to making WGM III, Ouellet had to use production music as a last-minute scoring option on another magic production, and subsequently he decided to make WGM III entirely using production music, for which he searched through 15,000 'cuts'.Music for Magicians, Gary Ouellet Each performer's music track was specially created from at least one (often several) library track, with stingers, hits and various accentuating effects from Gary Ouellet's Designer Textures for Magicians. Hence, WGM 3-5 were taped live with the pre-prepared music tracks. The following tracks have been identified as being used within the noted performers' sets: WGM III: * 'Damned' from Kosinus (Brett Daniels - Appearing Car) * 'Shock Troops' and 'Car Wash' from Kosinus (Hans Klok) * 'Pure Silk' from JW Media Music and 'Angel Wave' from Kosinus (Galina) * 'Tabasco Road' & 'Angel Eyes' from Koka, and 'Funky Lady' from Opus 1 (Peter Marvey) * 'Mystic Party' from Kosinus, and 'Requiem, Op. 89, B. 165:III.

Allen passed the bar exam in Maine in 1844 and became a Massachusetts Justice of the Peace in 1847. He moved to South Carolina after the American Civil War to practice law and was elected as a judge in 1873 and again in 1876. Following the Reconstruction Era, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he continued practicing law.  Career = Becoming a lawyer= Born in Indiana as A. Macon Bolling, he moved to New England at some point in the early 1840s and changed his name to Macon Bolling Allen in Boston in January 1844. Soon after, Allen moved to Portland, Maine and studied law, working as an apprentice to General Samuel Fessenden, a local abolitionist and attorney. The Portland District Court rejected Fessenden‚Äôs first motion to admit Allen to the bar in April 1844, concluding Allen did not meet the state‚Äôs citizenship requirement.Johnie D. Smith, Allen, Macon Bolling, in Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience (Henry Louis Gates et al. eds., 2d ed. 2005). Allen tried again, pursuing admission by examination, a method that did not require citizenship. He faced a hostile examination committee, which Fessenden thought did not want Allen admitted.Letter from Samuel Fessenden to Samuel E. Sewall (July 5, 1844) (Robie-Sewall family papers, Massachusetts Historical Society), as reprinted in Daniel Hinchen, Passing the bar: America‚Äôs first African-American Attorney, Mass. Hist. Soc. (May 7, 2019). Nevertheless, Fessenden said, ‚Äúhis qualifications were not denied.‚Äù Allen was granted his license to practice law in Maine on July 3, 1844, becoming the nation's first African American lawyer. He experienced difficulty finding legal work in Maine, likely because whites were unwilling to hire a black attorney and few blacks lived in Maine. Allen moved back to Boston, Massachusetts, and was admitted to the bar there in May 1845. He conducted a jury trial in October 1845 that is believed to be the first time an African American lawyer argued before a jury in the United States. The case was a contract dispute. Allen‚Äôs client, the defendant, lost, although the jury awarded lower damages than the plaintiff had requested. Allen encountered difficulties in Boston. Racial prejudice made it difficult for him to earn a living; in 1845, he wrote a letter to John Jay Jr. (the grandson of the country‚Äôs first Chief Justice) discussing the difficulty of finding clients in Boston and wondering whether he would do better in New York City, with its larger African American population. Four years later, Allen was attacked by four men in Boston, although their motivation is unclear. In 1852, Allen‚Äôs landlord pressed charges against him for allegedly ripping out parts of his apartment to burn as firewood. A jury acquitted him. = Judgeships in Massachusetts and South Carolina = After passing a rigorous qualifying exam for Justice of the Peace for Middlesex County, Massachusetts in 1847, Allen became the first African American in the United States to hold a judicial position, despite not being considered a U.S. citizen under the Constitution at the time. As Justice of the Peace, Allen would have handled minor crimes and small claims. Allen moved to Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War and opened a law office with two other African American attorneys, William Whipper and Robert Elliott. Their firm, Whipper, Elliott, and Allen, is the first known African American law firm in the country. Among other cases, Allen represented several black defendants who were fighting death sentences. The state legislature in 1873 elected Allen (choosing him instead of Whipper) to be a judge of Charleston County Criminal Court. He served for three years. In 1876, he was elected as probate judge for Charleston County, South Carolina, defeating the white incumbent. = Later career = Allen moved to Washington, D.C., at the end of Reconstruction. He continued to practice law and was employed as an attorney in 1873 for a firm called the Land and Improvement Association. Personal life Allen and his wife, Emma Levy, had six children while living in the Boston area.Daphne B. Noyes, Macon Bolling Allen, 1816-1894, The Church of the Advent, . Two died in childhood. The family spent some of their Massachusetts years in Dedham, where a deed shows property owned by ‚ÄúEmma L. Allen ‚Ä¶ wife of Macon B. Allen.‚Äù After moving to South Carolina, Allen and Emma had another child. Emma died in 1870, along with another of the couple‚Äôs children. Allen married his second wife, Hannah Weston, at some point before 1880. Allen died in Washington in 1894, age 78.

The community is located along the north bank of the Salmon River, opposite the town of Truro and is largely a farming area. The area was first settled by Acadians and resettled after their expulsion as Onslow Township in 1761 by Irish emigrants under Colonel McNutt. The township is believed to have been named after Arthur Onslow. An important highway interchange is located in the community, where Highway 102 terminates at Highway 104. Onslow is home to Central Colchester Junior High School, operated by the Chignecto-Central Regional School Board. Onslow also contains a small corner store, a John Deere dealership and a volunteer fire department. In the fall and spring, migrating Canada geese are attracted to the farmlands. Onslow is geographically situated in an area with high winds, making it an excellent location for wind turbines. Some farmers in the area have chosen to erect wind turbines to power their farm(s).

Description Dracophyllum recurvum grows up to one metre high at lower altitudes, or down to less than five centimetres at higher altitudes. The plant's branches are covered in a greyish bark, and its leaves vary from dark green at lower altitudes to reds and greys at higher altitudes. Leaves are in length and usually approximately wide. The physical characteristics of D. recurvum vary greatly with changes in altitude. It is distinguishable from other species in the genus by its thin, recurved leaves. Distribution Dracophyllum recurvum grows in subalpine and alpine environments in the volcanic Central Plateau of the North Island of New Zealand. It is especially plentiful on Mount Ruapehu and the other mountains of Tongariro National Park. D. recurvum is one of the few plant species that can survive the extreme conditions on Ruapehu, due to its wide-spreading root system, which firmly anchors the plant to the thin soil, as well as helping halt erosion on the mountain.

Career Ed was born in Eagleville, Ohio, and made his first appearance in Majors with the Buffalo Bisons, but was only able to pitch in seven games, all of which he started, and had a respectable win/loss total of 3-3, as well as a 3.93 ERA. For the following season, he played for the minor league Milwaukee Brewers, who would later join the newly formed and ill-fated Union Association as a late season replacement. Ed pitched extremely well, in the four games in which he pitched to finish the season, he had a record of 4-0, with a 1.00 ERA, 47 strikeouts in 36 innings pitched. He completed all four starts and pitched two shutouts, one of which was a no-hitter thrown on September 28, 1884, vs. the Washington Nationals, a 5-0 victory. It was the second and last no-hitter thrown in the Union Association, and was the second game the Brewers had played since joining the league as a late season replacement. He followed up his no-hitter with eight more hitless innings on October 4, against the Boston Reds, when he finally surrendered a hit, a ninth inning bloop single, but holds on for the 2-0 shutout victory. His remarkable season with the Brewers earned him a shot with the Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association for the season. After 10 starts, he then moved to and finished the season with the New York Metropolitans, also of the Association. Late in the season, on September 16, in a game against the Pittsburgh Alleganys, he struck out eight batters in a row. He pitched for them during both the and seasons, earning the team award of Pitcher of the Year for the 1885 and 1886 seasons. For the season he returned to the minors, this time in the Western Association and played for Charlie Morton's Des Moines team. When Morton took over the minor league Toledo Maumee team, he moved several of his Des Moines players with him, including Cushman, who would play for that team through the season, and in season when the team earned Major League status by joining the American Association. This was the only season the Maumees played in the Majors. Post-career After his playing days, he worked as a conductor on the New York Central Railroad, and was also a restaurant owner at one time.

The series was broadcast on Zee TV.  Concept  Teen Bahuraniyaan is a tale of three bahus (daughters-in-law) -- Manjeet (Payal), Bindiya, and Janki; who come from different backgrounds and now live under one roof with the Gheewala parivar (family). They are an upper-class Gujarati joint family living in Ahmedabad. Their lives pass through distinct ups and downs as they share different equations and are at different levels with their in-laws and other family members. Keeping alive their personal interests the bahuraniyaas tackle day- to-day affairs in their own way and manner. They manage to fight against what is wrong and prove themselves worthy of the Gheewala parivar. The daughters- in-law attempt to maintain peace in the family but face challenges from outside and within, particularly from their mother-in-law, whose selfish behavior threatens to destroy the unity and peace. Within this seriousness, each episode usually features a great deal of comedy, making the show appealing to a wide range of audience. Plot The married couples are Rohit and Bindiya; Sameer and Janki; Mahesh and Manjeet (Payal) Teen Bahuraniyaan takes a major twist, when Mahesh marries Payal, after the death of Manjeet due to blood cancer. As Kajal (Payal's sister) was going to marry Mahesh, the report was out that she was pregnant with someone else's child. Mahesh ended up marrying Payal, Kajal's younger sister. Kajal was furious and commits suicide. However, her spirit comes back and start to make the Gheewala family and especially Bindiya and tries to make Payal's life as hell. She occupies Bindiya's body and she tortures her so much that Bindiya was scared to death and before her target was only the Gheewala family. As Kunjbala (her bhua) took Payal's side, she got even furious and tries to kill her as well but the thaaveez (a note added to a thread and that is blessed by God) saves her. After the incident, the family call Trikal Baba and, with his help, they trap Kajal's evil spirit. After all the havoc, the three couples decide to go on a holiday trip but are unaware that they are being followed by terrorists. A grand mask party takes place. All couples are dancing to the song \\"Darde disco\\". Sameer, Rohit, and Mahesh go to get some drinks when a huge bomb blast happens. Janki screams and sees two dead bodies wearing watches just like the one Sameer was wearing. She faints and is taken to the hospital. The whole family rushes to see her. There they find Payal, Bindiya, and Janki. Two of the sons are dead, but they don't know which ones. The bodies of the sons are burnt by G kaka. The people who come for the prayers tell the Geewala family that the daughters-in-law should be here and they should from now on only wear white saris as they are widows. Janki, Payal, and Bindiya arrive wearing red saris and heavy jewelry. Everyone is shocked. The three say that they won't wear white saris until it is found out who is dead and who isn't. Indira, Kokila, and Bhavna support their daughters-in-law. The bahuraniyaans go to the 'mandir'. Janki gets into an accident and that is where they reveal Sameer is alive. Sameer gets up; he has lost his memory. Janki is trying to explain that Sameer is alive, but no one wants to believe her. Janki has a sixth sense and can find out the future. She saves Bindiya from a falling chandelier. She sees a mandir and Sameer running. She also sees Payal in a white sari gagged and tied up. All of these come true. Later she sees a wedding and Bindiya getting married again. Bhavna and Kokila think Janki finally went crazy and try to set her straight. Sameer breaks into the Gheewala house not knowing it is his home. Janki tries to catch him, but Sameer runs away. She tells Bhavna, and Bhavna gets mad. Janki goes to Bindiya's room to persuade her to mary Jatin because then Sameer would return home. Bhavna brings people from the mental asylum to take Janki away; Bindiya stops them. Bindiya is ready to marry and everybody is shocked. Jatin and Shaguna's real identity comes to face at the marriage venue and they run away from the police. Everyone is happy to see Sameer as he told the truth about Shaguna and Jatin. Sameer swears to bring Rohit and Mahesh back. Everyone is praying when all three sons return and a new life starts in Gheewala parrivar, but G kaka is dead. The family receives money in the mail. Bindiya tells everyone that she is thinking about buying a car with that money; the family is saying that they will need that money later. Bindiya, Janki, Bhavana and Payal say that they want to buy a new car. The bahuraniyaan decide to contribute money for the car: Bindiya gives 1 lakh and so does Janki. Payal refuses and says that she has saved the money for something else. Payal needs the money to get an operation for Mahesh. Everyone chips in and said that instead of buying a car they will help Mahesh. Janki sees a guy taking pictures of the house. Mithi Baa says not to worry. Janki again sees the same car, but this time Manhar comes out of it with the guy from the day before. It's Diwali and everyone's doing the puja. Someone comes to meet Manhar. Janki goes behind the screen and hears everything. Manhar wants to sell Mithiba mansion. Manhar tells Hari and Kanti. They are hesitant. Bindiya and Bhavna go to Mumbai for a shoot that Bindiya has. When Indira and Kokila find out about selling the house, they want it. Now people are saying that they need Sunanda's permission. Kokila secretly gets Sunanda's signatures by saying that they are for G kaka's bank accounts. They realize that people need to meet her in person. Kokila and Indira make a plan to pretend to send Mithiba and Sunanda on a religious journey. Manhar Kanti and Hari take them to the bus stop and leave them there. It is discovered that they are outside a nursing home and that is where they must stay. The guy comes to see Sunanda, and Kokila comes down dressed as her. Janki sees but keeps quiet. Sameer, Rohit, Mahesh, Payal, and Janki are trying to get their parents to tell them what they are planning because they want to hear it for themselves. Indira tells Sameer, and his trust is broken. They then make a plan to try and stop the sale. The buyer is called to the house by the kids. Payal calls Kokila. Kokila comes and the guy realizes that Kokila was pretending to be Sunanda! He leaves. Indira and Kokila get mad at the bahus; the sons say that they planned the whole thing. They are speechless. Kokila gets a call from Manhar who says that the buying of the house was cancelled. Kokila and Indira call Bhavna from Mumbai. Both Bindiya and Bhavna come. Maharanis want to get revenge. They get Bindiya fired from her job. There is news that Janki's dad is sick; she goes to him. Maharanis insults Payal and Bindiya in front of their friends. Sameer goes to the nursing home to make a donation. He accidentally leaves his phone behind. Sunanda gets the phone and knows that Sameer came. Rohit calls Sameer to find out where he is. Sameer sees a lady answering his phone. All is revealed when Sunanda turns around and sees Sameer. Mithiba tells Sameer what has happened. Rohit is listening because the phone has not been disconnected. Sameer goes home without them because Sunanda says she doesn't want the sons to be ashamed of what they did. Bindiya, Payal, and Mahesh find out what happened. The three young sons go to their fathers and tell them that they know, that they are ashamed of them, and that they should get Mithiba and Sunanda back. In the last episode, Sunanda and Mithiba were back. The oldest boys of the family sell papad. Their wives, Kokila, Indira, and Bhavna do different things. Bhavna works in serials, Kokila takes care of the pepper business, and Indira cooks for the family. The three younger daughters-in-law Janki, Bindiya, and Payal are all pregnant.

Book Summary  Sara and Jeffrey have tentatively resumed their romantic relationship when, on a hot August night during the summer following Blindsighted, Jeffrey is forced to shoot a 13-year-old girl to stop her from killing another teenager. What at first appears to be an unwanted pregnancy and a jilting turned deadly spurs an investigation that reveals the presence of real-life monsters preying on the children of Grant County. During its course Jeffrey battles self-doubt and remorse over killing a child, and an impromptu trip back to his hometown of Sylacauga, Alabama offers up a major clue. Lena, who just returned to duty a month earlier following her torture at the hands of the man who murdered her beloved sister and terrorized Heartsdale, fights misplaced guilt and shame, battling suicidal tendencies and struggling to regain some minute sense of normalcy in her life. Even as she contemplates quitting the police, the only thing that provides her with relief is work, and as she immerses herself more and deeper into the case she finds an uncomfortable feeling of identification with one of its most damaged victims.

He has released two albums. Biography=Early life= Harel Moyal (stage name) was born in Gilo, Jerusalem. When he was a year and a half old his family moved to the Ma'ale Adumim settlement in the West Bank, where he grew up with his brother. As a child, Moyal listened a lot to his father who used to play the guitar and perform occasionally in the Andalusian Music Band (Spanish orchestra), and also compose songs. Moyal grew up in a musical house but what was unique about him was that, even though he grew up in a musical house as a kid and as a teenager he did not plan to pursue a musical career. At school he was a smart kid that had many friends and he used to participate in many after school activities which became his hobbies and mostly various lessons and studies in dancing. Of course as a kid he loved music and used to listen a lot to it, when he grew up he also learned to play the guitar just like his dad. After graduating from the high school all that time he kept on working on his passion for music by playing his guitar and writing songs. =Kokhav Nolad= When the auditioning for the second season of Kokhav Nolad began, Moyal's friend registered him for the trials. At the beginning Moyal was not too anxious about going to the trials, but then he decided to go and check out his abilities. In a short while everyone at the production told him that they loved him and he was invited to participate in the show. At the second season of Kokhav Nolad, Moyal won the competition. The final of the second season was broadcast on August 15, 2004, from the Coca-Cola Music Village on the coast of Nitzanim, in front of an audience of 7,500 people. Harel Moyal won the contest with 862,368 votes, Harel Skaat took second place with 806,292 votes, and Adi Cohen took third place with 254,926 votes. Almost 2 million votes were cast during the final. Since Skaat won first place and Moyal second in the first semi-final against Harel Moyal, and since polls held at certain sites indicated that Harel Skaat would win, many were surprised when he did not. A controversy arose about the voting in the final, beginning with claims that the production company had forged the results and ending with claims that voters had used software to send in more votes for their candidate than was allowed by program regulations (250 votes per apparatus). The production staff denied all of these allegations. On Thursday, August 19, a small demonstration of about 20 Harel Skaat fans was held in front of the offices of Shidurey Keshet. The demonstrators demanded that they investigate the claims and retabulate the votes. Shidurey Keshet reported that the matter was investigated and that disruptions in the voting were not found. =2004 Chanukah Song Festival= Moyal's success made him very famous and he got many offers from the music industry. The first challenge he took on himself was participating in the 2004 Chanukah Song Festival. He sang the song Zorro, which was written by Uzi Khitman and composed by Shlomi Shabat Moyal again won the contest . =2004‚Äì2005: Harel Moyal= Moyal started working on his debut album. He went through material he had written during the years and material he was offered to sing. From all the songs, he chose 12 songs and the self-titled album was released in September 2005. The first single released from the album is called Middle of the Night in the Village. The song was written by Moyal and is about the confusion and tough time at the military service. The song had much success in the local charts and it was also played on the music TV channel. The album sold very well and turned into a gold album by selling over 20,000 copies of it just a bit over a week after its release. =2005‚Äì2006: Like in a Movie= After taking out the successful album Moyal was asked to perform in a musical called Like in A Movie. The play started to be shown in February 2006. Moyal had the lead role in it and portrayed the character of a young teenager who is rebellious and is discovered for his musical talent. In the musical play many well known artists and actors performed and it had success throughout Israel. =2007: Levadi= Moyal's second album, Levadi, was released in 2007.

Development Shortly after the German attack in 1941, Soviet headquarters realized a need for transport gliders and ordered the development of several designs. Oleg Antonov offered a light glider, of which preliminary sketches had been drawn in 1939. It was first named RF-8 (Rot Front-8) and was essentially an enlarged variant of a sports glider, the RF-7. Following trials, its capacity was increased from five to seven persons (including pilot). The A-7 was an all-wooden high-wing monoplane, with a retractable undercarriage. It was evaluated in late 1941 and ordered for production, under the designation A-7 (Antonov, seven persons). Approximately 400 were built. In late 1942 ‚Äì early 1943, an unusual variant was tested ‚Äì a tanker glider, fitted with a 1000-litre fuel tank, hauled by a DB-3 bomber which was refuelled during flight in order to increase range. It was not produced. Operational history The A-7, along with the Gribovsky G-11, constituted the majority of Soviet transport gliders. They were mainly used for supplying Soviet partisans with provisions, weapons, equipment and trained men. The most intensive use was from April to November 1943 in Belarus, in the Polotsk- Begoml-Lepel area. Several hundreds of Soviet gliders (of all types) were used in night supply flights at this time. After landing, gliders were destroyed and pilots were sometimes taken back by aircraft. Gliders were also used to supply partisans in some areas in 1944. They were also used to transport sabotage groups behind enemy lines, though the small capacity of the A-7 made it not very suitable for such actions. A-7s were towed mainly by SB or Ilyushin DB-3 bombers (The DB-3 could tow two A-7s). A less typical action was an air bridge from Moscow to the Stalingrad area in November 1942, in order to quickly deliver antifreeze cooling liquid for tanks, during the battle of Stalingrad. The A-7 was considered a successful design, but it had less capacity than the other light glider, the G-11. Moreover, a place for cargo was limited by an arrangement of seats and a presence of cantilevers of a retractable landing gear in the center of a transport compartment. It could transport seven troops (including pilot) or up to 900 kg of cargo. Description High-wing, mixed construction (mostly wooden). Fuselage semi- monocoque, rectangular in cross-section. Single-seat pilot's cab in front. Behind it, a transport compartment, with six seats: two on sides in front (opposite each other), two on sides in back, and two in the middle (facing front and back). There were double doors in the left side in front, and on the right side in back (left front and right back seats must be raised prior to opening door).

The term Navajo Pueblitos, also known as Din√©tah Pueblitos, refers to a class of archaeological sites that are found in the northwestern corner of the American state of New Mexico. The sites generally consist of relatively small stone and timber structures which are believed to have been built by the Navajo people in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. The sites are located within the cultural area known as the Din√©tah, the traditional homeland of the Navajo tribe of Native Americans. Pueblitos (Spanish for \\"little villages\\"; cf. Pueblo Native Americans) are generally found in defensible locations along mesa rims and on isolated outcrops and boulders. The structures themselves can consist of from one to six rooms, and take the form of multi-storied towers, cliff dwellings, and fort-like enclosures.  Setting  The majority of pueblito sites are located on lands administered by the United States Bureau of Land Management in Rio Arriba and San Juan counties, New Mexico. Pueblitos, as well as a large number of other early Navajo sites are clustered in the Largo and Gobernador canyons, which drain in a north and westerly direction to the San Juan River.  Pueblo influence  The sites, now in ruins, date to what archaeologists have named the Gobernador phase of Navajo history. This was a period of population movements which began with the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, during which the Spanish were driven from New Mexico by an alliance of various Rio Grande and Western Pueblo tribes. The Spaniards returned in 1692, and it appears that some Pueblo people fled to the mesas and canyons of the Navajo. A large Puebloan influx to the Din√©tah region was long seen by archaeologists as the impetus for a mixing of Puebloan and Navajo cultural traits which appears to have taken place in the 18th century. The presence of Pueblo refugees has also been generally credited as an important driving force behind the construction of the pueblitos. There is, however, some debate over the evidence that any large number of Pueblo people lived with the Navajos in this period. Spanish reports seem to indicate that portions of several Tewa and two Jemez communities may have sought refuge with the Navajos. However, historical evidence from the Hopi Pueblos indicates that the majority of the refugees from the Rio Grande region went to Hopi, leading some scholars to believe that the number of Puebloans that fled to Navajo country may have been as little as a few hundred.  Defensive nature  Whether constructed by Navajos, Puebloans, or a combination of both, most scholars agree that the Pueblitos are highly defensive in nature. Din√©tah was a frontier area at the beginning of the 18th century, held by Navajos and possibly Pueblo refugees against retaliatory Spanish expeditions and Ute-Comanche raids. The defensive strategies employed at Pueblito sites consist of two general elements; advance warning, and regulation of access. The location of sites allowed for good views of approach routes, and sites were often situated so that they could be visually linked.  Architecture  Pueblitos are generally constructed as two-story masonry structures situated on rock outcroppings or cliff edges. The shape of the structures generally follows the contour of the outcrop on which it rests. The interior space is partitioned by abutting cross walls to the outer walls. In most cases the structures and rooms tend to have rounded corners. The masonry is usually of readily available unshaped sandstone blocks and slabs which are set in mud mortar. Room interiors are often covered with hand pressed adobe mortar. Room ceilings are supported by pi√±on and juniper logs (vigas). Above the primary beams, slats of juniper and pi√±on are placed laterally latillas . Adobe is sometimes placed atop the latillas to form a floor. Spanish style hooded fireplaces are found in some sites. Many pueblitos are in good condition and walls often stand from 4 to 15 feet in height. Forked-stick hogans occur throughout the Din√©tah region, as well as in association with pueblitos. The hogans usually have a framework of three main posts that form a tripod. Split juniper slats are placed on the framework to form a cone. The juniper slats were originally covered with a layer of mud mortar, but this layer has since washed away from the structures of this period.

Klim is sold worldwide, Early ads featured the slogan \\"Spell it backwards.\\" History Klim was developed as a dehydrated whole-milk powder for use in the tropics, where ordinary milk tended to spoil quickly. It soon became a staple of scientific explorers, geologists, soldiers, and other jungle travelers who needed a lightweight dry ration that would keep for several days in high heat and humidity, even when decanted from its container. In 1920 Klim was a product of Merrell-Soule Company of Syracuse, New York which in 1907 had improved the spray-drying method patented by Robert Stauf in 1901 by starting with condensed milk instead of regular milk. In 1927 Borden acquired Merrell-Soule gaining the Klim brand and None Such Mincemeat, both already made popular worldwide. During World War II, Klim was initially adopted as part of the U.S. Army Jungle ration.Kearny, Cresson H., Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), p. 289 As one officer noted, \\"That quite dense milk powder kept safely for years if its stout can was unopened, and for at least a week in jungle heat if taken out and kept in a waterproof bag\\". Klim was later issued by the Red Cross to prisoners of war, particularly those held in German prison camps, in order to increase caloric intake. According to British author J. G. Ballard, Klim was included in American relief supplies dropped over Shanghai, China, and the surrounding countryside following the Japanese surrender in August 1945. As a teenager, Ballard had been interned for two years and five months in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre. The cans of powdered milk, along with tinned SPAM, chocolate bars, and cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes, are mentioned in Ballard's novel, Empire of the Sun, and his autobiography, Miracles of Life. Klim was also found in other theatres ‚Äì for example in the Burma Campaign, where troops retreating from the Japanese invasion found tins of Klim in deserted villages. These proved very useful and provided much needed sustenance. Klim cans were approximately four inches in diameter and three inches deep. The metal in the cans could be fashioned into a variety of different tools and other useful items such as scoops and candle holders. Klim cans were instrumental in the escape attempt from Stalag Luft III. In the book Under The Wire, William Ash and Brendan Foley tell how World War II prisoners of war removed the bottoms from the tins and hooked them together to form airtight pipes to provide air while digging escape tunnels. Scavenged Klim cans were used in the construction of the extensive ventilation ducting in three tunnels that lead out of the prison camp. One former prisoner at Stalag Luft III, Charles Huppert, told how prisoners became expert at turning tin cans into tools. Huppert said, \\"We used Klim tins for everything that we made, because you could cut the ends out, and have a large piece of tin to work with. You can straighten that out flat, and make a ... join them together in a locked joint, such as this, and take your wooden mallet and hammer them down. Then you take your backside of a knife and bear down on that, with a lot of pressure on both sides of that crimp, so that the tin will not separate, in order to make the tools that are used in the tunnels: the digging tools, the funnels, and the lamps to give light.\\"NOVA transcript of Great Escapes, PBS Airdate: November 16, 2004 NotesExternal links *Illustration showing use of Klim and other tins for South African POW's \\"Blower\\" cooker *Can, Powdered Milk, Lockheed Sirius \\"Tingmissartoq\\", Lindbergh *Mentioned in an interview with William McDonough.

Plot summary The plot is a faithful representation of the third and fourth module of Dragonlance, Dragons of Hope and Dragons of Desolation. The same two modules were also adapted into a novel, Dragons of the Dwarven Depths, but only in 2006, that is 12 years after Shadow Sorcerer.

He concluded, \\"Shadow Sorceror is for me another sign that SSI is finally getting its act together to produce games that justify the mighty AD&D; licence.\\" The One gave the Amiga version of Shadow Sorcerer an overall score of 77%, beginning their review by stating that 'it's a pity' that Shadow Sorcerer \\"doesn't offer as much\\" as Eye of the Beholder, furthermore stating that \\"Shadow Sorcerer fails in that there is either too much or too little going on at one time.\\" The One expresses that the refugees the player must protect \\"move at such a slow pace that you can't help getting bored waiting for them\\" and if the player leaves them to explore, the player is punished in that the refugees are open to attack, and isn't able to get back to them in time. The One criticises Shadow Sorcerer's combat, stating that \\"the computer has no sense of simple strategy. You will often get into combat and prepare your wizard to cast a fireball spell, only to find that the rest of the characters have run into the fight and got in the way, completely wasting it.\\" The One calls Shadow Sorcerer good \\"to a certain extent\\", and expresses that it \\"never quite reaches [what] other RPGs have managed to\\".

The cylindrical grinder owes much of its development from the onset of the Industrial Revolution, particularly to the advent of reliable, inexpensive steel production and later the improvement of the grinding wheel. The basis for the modern day cylindrical grinder was first built in the 1830s by two men working independently, Jonathan Bridges and James Wheaton . It is unclear as to which man had first produced the machine but both are closely tied to the first historical appearance of the modern day tool. It took another 40 years before further improvement and refinement of the tool occurred.Robert, Woodbury. History of the Grinding Machine. 2nd. Cambridge: M.I.T. Press, 1964. 31-71. The Brown & Sharpe company in Providence, RI was one of the first builders of the Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine, one of the first piece of precision machinery to be used in a residential setting. Joseph Brown believed that the shaft and needle bars of the sewing machine must be crafted from hardened tool steel. It was this desire that led to their experimentation with building a cylindrical grinder. The first attempt was simply a small lathe with a grinding wheel mounted to it. Subsequent attempts led to the cylindrical grinder displayed at the 1876 Centennial Exposition and the subsequent patent. It is important to note that Brown & Sharpe cannot be given sole credit of pioneering advances in cylindrical grinding. A man in Waltham, Massachusetts, Ambrose Webster had created a small grinding machine in 1860 that contained all of the improvements Brown & Sharpe claimed to be their own original invention. Even more so, the emphasis on precision, accuracy, and reliability was championed by Charles Norton.Day, Lance; McNeil, Ian. Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology. London and New York: Routledge, 1996. 525-527 Norton was an employee of Brown & Sharpe who quit the company with the desire to further pursue his belief that the cylindrical grinder is not merely a finishing tool but could be a staple of the machine shop. He founded the Norton Grinding Company, where he continued improving the cylindrical grinder to use faster rpm values and more precise grinding tolerances. He was acknowledged for his work on April 18, 1925 when he won The John Scott Medal and Premium for his invention of \\"accurate grinding devices of high power\\". These standards developed by Norton were the status quo until about the middle of the 20th century. The remainder of technological innovation applicable to the cylindrical grinder is almost identical and entangled in a sense, to the rest of machine tools. The innovation of the last 70 years can be characterized by three waves of change.Arnold, Heinrich Martin. \\"The recent history of the machine tool industry and the effects of technological change.\\" Institute for Innovation Research and Technology Management. Nov. 2001. University of Munich The first wave was the creation of numerical control by John T. Parsons in the 1940s. The U.S. Air Force, looking for a faster, cheaper, and more efficient means of part and tool production for airplanes, played a large role in developing NC both politically and financially. The first implementation of NC in machine tools occurred in the 1950s and continued through the 1960s. The second wave of innovation, occurring during the 1970s and 1980s, is marked by the massive demand for microcomputers to be used to direct NC. The joining of computers marked the birth of Computer Numerical Control which once again revolutionized the ability of the cylindrical grinder. Now the machine was able to receive instruction from a computer which would give it precise directions on every imaginable dimension and measurement needed to produce the desired product. This was a completely different work environment in comparison to mid-century production where a worker had to direct the machine at every point on how to manipulate the work. The third wave of change came in the 1990s with the advent of the Personal Computer. Integrating CNC and the PC into one dynamic system allowed for even further control of the manufacturing process that required little to no human supervision. Types Outside Diameter Cylindrical Grinding Inside Diameter Cylindrical Grinding There are five different types of cylindrical grinding: outside diameter (OD) grinding, inside diameter (ID) grinding, plunge grinding, creep feed grinding, and centerless grinding.Stephenson, David. Metal Cutting Theory and Practice. 2nd. Boca Raton: CRC Press, 1997. 52-60. =Outside diameter grinding= OD grinding is grinding occurring on external surface of an object between the centers. The centers are end units with a point that allow the object to be rotated. The grinding wheel is also being rotated in the same direction when it comes in contact with the object. This effectively means the two surfaces will be moving opposite directions when contact is made which allows for a smoother operation and less chance of a jam up.Kocherovsky, Eugene. \\"50 years of technological Development.\\" Cutting Tool Engineering. 57.8 (2005): 95-114. =Inside diameter grinding= ID grinding is grinding occurring on the inside of an object. The grinding wheel is always smaller than the width of the hole being ground. The object is held in place by a collet, which also rotates the object in place. Just as with OD grinding, the grinding wheel and the object rotated in opposite directions giving reversed direction contact of the two surfaces where the grinding occurs. See also ID Grinding. =Plunge grinding= A form of OD grinding, however the major difference is that the grinding wheel makes continuous contact with a single point of the object instead of traversing the object. =Creep feed grinding= Creep Feed is a form of grinding where a full depth of cut is removed in a single pass of the wheel. Successful operation of this technique can reduce manufacturing time by 50%, but often the grinding machine being used must be designed specifically for this purpose. This form occurs in both cylindrical and surface grinding. =Centerless grinding= Centerless cylindrical grinder A schematic of the centerless grinding process. Centerless grinding is a form of grinding where there is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a regulating wheel positioned on the opposite side of the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the regulating wheel, with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. Centerless grinding is much easier to combine with automatic loading procedures than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the regulating wheel is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.Houghton, Phillip. Grinding Wheels and Machines. 1st. Sussx, England: The Lewes Press, 1963. 155-174. Control methods There are three basics ways in which an operator can interact with a cylindrical grinder. Either manual manipulation of the machine, Numerical Control with a punched card system or using Computer Numerical Control using a pre existing interface designed for that machine or by using a PC as an interface to communicate with the grinder. The first two options are rarely if ever used today. CNC operated cylindrical grinders are the most technologically advanced, efficient, reliable systems in the manufacturing industry. Applications The cylindrical grinder is responsible for a plethora of innovations and inventions in the progression of science and technology. Any situation in which extremely precise metalworking is required, the cylindrical grinder is able to provide a high level of precision. From the automotive industry to military applications, the benefits of the cylindrical grinder are numerous.

History Monty Adkins Adkins was born in Leamington, UK, and is currently living in Huddersfield, UK. He read music at Pembroke College (Cambridge, UK) and then, in 1993, became a member of the BEAST (Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre). He studied electronic music with Jonty Harrison and then Simon Waters. It was at the age of 22 that he first came to international attention with the electroacoustic works Melt and Clothed in the Soft Horizon. Between them these works were awarded the Stockholm Electronic Arts Award (Sweden), the R√©sidence Prize (Bourges, France) and the Grand Prix of Musica Nova (Prague, Czech Republic). He has since won more than twenty international prizes for his work, which has been performed and broadcast throughout Europe, USA, Canada, Australasia, China, and Asia. He has worked in a number of prestigious European studios, including EMS (Stockholm, Sweden), Ina-GRM and IRCAM (Paris, France), C√©sare (Reims, France), and Heinrich Strobel Studio (Freiburg, Germany). In the early 1990s, Adkins concentrated predominantly on acousmatic concert music, electronic works for contemporary dance, multimedia works, and electroacoustic music. What he was particularly drawn to in writing such works is the collaborative process that evolves between the composer and artist/performers. The most notable of these have been Neurotransmission (1998), an hour-long acousmatic dance score written for Wayne McGregor and Random Dance in 1998, Still Time (2001) for the flutist Alejandro Escuer, Symbiont (2002) a multimedia collaboration with Miles Chalcraft, and nights bright daies (2003) for the Ictus piano and percussion quartet; the latter premiered in June 2004 at the Festival Agora No 7 at IRCAM (Paris, France). In recent years he has collaborated extensively with the composer Paulina Sundin and recorder player/composer Terri Hron. Following a brief period in New Zealand in 2006 his work changed significantly. Becoming more influenced by minimal electronica, oceanic glitch and microscound his work became less overtly gestural, introverted and personal. His work also began to explore extended timeframes. Although split into sections, Five Panels (2008, 46 mins) and fragile.flicker.fragment (2011, 53 mins) and Four Shibusa (2012, 43 mins) are essentially multipart works rather than albums with separate tracks. Four Shibusa, for example, is composed using clarinet sounds, recorded by Jonathan Sage and Heather Roche. His recent works continue this way of thinking and includes Rift Patterns (2014) released as an iBook complete with a short story by Deborah Templeton, photographs by Stephen Harvey, and videos by Jason Payne.

It was a leading glass manufacturer and a pioneer of British glassmaking technology. The Chance family originated in Bromsgrove as farmers and craftsmen before setting up business in Smethwick in 1824. Situated between Birmingham and the Black Country in the agglomeration of the Midlands industrial heartland, they took advantage of the skilled workers, canals and many advances that were taking place in the industrial West Midlands at the time. Throughout its almost two centuries of history many changes affected the company which, now privatised, continues to function as Chance Glass Limited, a specialised industrial glass manufacturer in Malvern, Worcestershire at one of its small subsidiary factories. The social and economic impact of the company on the region is the subject of a project sponsored by the Heritage Lottery Fund. History=19th century= Robert Lucas Chance ‚Äì from a photograph Robert Lucas Chance (8 October 1782 ‚Äì 7 March 1865), known as 'Lucas', bought the British Crown Glass Company's works in Spon Lane in 1824. The company specialised in making crown window glass.Revolutionary Players The company ran into difficulty and its survival was guaranteed in 1832 by investment from Chance's brother, William (29 August 1788 ‚Äì 8 February 1856) who owned an iron factoring business in Great Charles Street, Birmingham. After the partnership with the Hartley Brothers was dissolved in 1836, Lucas and William Chance became partners in the business, which was renamed Chance Brothers and Company. Portrait of James Timmins Chance, by Joseph Gibbs, 1902 (possibly painted posthumously) Chance Brothers was amongst the earliest glass works to carry out the cylinder process in Europe, and the company became known as \\"... the greatest glass manufacturer in Britain.\\"Kohlmaier, Georg & Sartory, Barna von (1986) Houses of Glass: a nineteenth-century building type; translated by John C. Harvey; p. 47. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press , In 1832, it made the first British cylinder blown sheet glass using French and Belgian workers. In 1839, a new process to grind the surfaces of plate glass was patented by James Timmins Chance. In 1848 under the supervision of Georges Bontemps, a French glassmaker from Choisy-le-Roi, who had purchased the secret of the stirrer after the deaths of Pierre Louis Guinand and Joseph von Fraunhofer, the pioneers of the manufacture of high-precision lenses for observatory telescopes,King, Henry C. & Jones, Harold Spencer (2003) The History of the Telescope; p. 176.

Courier Dover Publications, , Bontemps agreed to share the secret with Chance Brothers and stayed in England to collaborate with them for six years. Just three other companies in Britain made glass in the same way, Pilkington of St Helens, Hartleys of Sunderland and Cooksons of Newcastle. During 1832, Chance Brothers became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass, and became the largest British manufacturer of window and plate glass, and optical glasses. The transept fa√ßade of the Crystal Palace One of the dials of the Great Clock of Westminster. (The minute hand is long.) Other Chance Brothers projects included glazing the Crystal Palace to house the Great Exhibition of 1851, and the Houses of Parliament, (built 1840‚Äì1860). At that time it was the only firm able to make the opal glass for the four faces of the Westminster Clock Tower which houses the famous bell, Big Ben. The ornamental windows for the White House in America were also made there. Other products included stained glass windows, ornamental lamp shades, microscope glass slides, painted glassware, glass tubing and specialist types of glass. They made a 24-inch (62 cm) flint glass lens for the Craig telescope. The French lens craftsman George Bontemps helped on the project, which for its day was a very large lens. They only made part of the lens which was a doublet, Thames Plate Glass Company made the other part. In 1870 Chance Brothers took over the failing Nailsea Glassworks but problems with coal supply led to the closure of that business. Elihu Burritt (1810‚Äì1879) the American philanthropist and social activist once said about Chance \\"In no other establishment in the world can one get such a full idea of the infinite uses which glass is made to serve as in these immense works\\". In 1900 a baronetcy was created for James Timmins Chance (22 March 1814 ‚Äì 6 January 1902), a grandson of William Chance, who started the family business in 1771. James became head of Chance Brothers until his retirement in 1889, when the company became a public company and its name changed to Chance Brothers & Co. Ltd. Sir James Chance was the first baronet.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: \\"Chance, James Timmins, first baronet\\", by Charles WelchKidd, Charles; Williamson, David (editors).

In 1933, the company was reported to be involved in an attempt to contact \\"any intelligent life\\" on the planet Mars, using adapted lighthouse optics from a mountaintop, the Jungfrau, in Switzerland. Chance also popularised slumped glass tableware, Fiestawarehttp://www.chanceglass.net that included many innovative designs, including the famous Swirl pattern (1955), and also Lace (1951), Night Sky (1957), Green Leaves (1958), Calypto (1959), with floral depictions from 1965 with Anemone. Glass-blowers 'Gathering' from the Furnace. (1943) by Mervyn Peake (Art.IWM ART LD 2851) During world War II, the company was involved in production of cathode ray tubes for early radar sets, making up to 7,000 per week. In 1943 the artist Mervyn Peake was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, to paint pictures recording such work. Glass ashtray, from a design by Kenneth Townsend, part of the 'Sights of London' series (1970s) Pilkington Brothers acquired a 50% shareholding in 1945 but the Chance operation continued to be largely separately managed and a factory was established in Malvern, Worcestershire in 1947 to specialise in laboratory glass where the operation was incorporated as an arms-length subsidiary. In 1948 the Malvern plant produced the world's first interchangeable syringe. By the end of 1952 Pilkington had assumed full financial control of Chance Brothers, but were not actively involved in its management until the mid- to late-1960s. When plastic disposable syringes displaced glass in the late 1960s, the range of its precision bore product was diversified. The production of flat glass ceased at Smethwick in 1976. The remainder of the works closed in 1981 ending more than 150 years of glass production at Smethwick and all flat glass production was absorbed by Pilkington's St Helens factories. Remaining glass tube processing, especially the manufacture of syringes and laboratory glassware, was moved to the Malvern plant. In 1992, during a period of rationalisation at Pilkingtons, a management buy-out reverted the Chance plant in Malvernofficial Chance web site. retrieved 7 June 2009. to private ownership and it became an independent company, changing its registered name to Chance Glass Limited, but retaining the historical Chance logo. Since then the company has continued to develop its range of products and processes, and areas now served include the pharmaceutical, chemical, metrology, electronics and lighting industries. Technology=Lighthouses= Heceta Head Lighthouse in Oregon. The Chance Brothers Fresnel lens, built in the early 1890s, is still in operation at this historic light station. An 85 mm Chance Brothers Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation which produced the light for the Sumburgh Head lighthouse until 1976. The lamp (made in approx. 1914) burned vaporized kerosene (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a denatured alcohol (methylated spirit) burner to light. When lit some of the vaporised fuel was diverted to a Bunsen burner to keep the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapour form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air; the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so. This in turn pressurized the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The white cloth is an unburnt mantle on which the vapour burned. From 1851, Chance Brothers became a major lighthouse engineering company, producing optical components, machinery, and other equipment for lighthouses around the world. James Timmins Chance pioneered placing lighthouse lamps inside a cage surrounded by fresnel lenses to increase the available light output; the cages, known as optics, revolutionised lighthouse design. Another important innovation from Chance Brothers was the introduction of rotating optics, allowing adjacent lighthouses to be distinguished from each other by the number of times per revolution that the light flashes. John Hopkinson, the noted English physicist and engineer, invented this system, while employed at Chance Brothers. =Rolled-plate glass= One of Chance's major contributions was the development of rolled-plate glass. During the 20th century, rolled- plate glass became the mainstay of the company's operation. =Clock faces= The German opal glass in the faces of the clock in the Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster (housing Big Ben) of the Houses of Parliament were damaged by Luftwaffe bombs during World War II. The damaged glass pieces needed to be replaced, but because of a difference in colour, it was decided to replace all the glass. The glass replaced by Chance Brothers was opal glass. =Large glass= In about 1848, Chance was one of the first companies to produce very long pieces of window glass, following technology developed as a result of finding a solution for an order from Joseph Paxton for a large greenhouse on the Chatsworth estate of the Dukes of Devonshire. It led to a contract to glaze the Crystal Palace in 1851 and which earned Joseph Paxton a knighthood. =Ultraviolet= Based on technology by Sir William Crookes, Chance Brothers was responsible for perfecting the manufacture of glass for the earliest optical lenses to block harmful ultra violet rays from the sun while retaining transparency.British patent No.312,728 filed 19 March 1928, Accorded 6 June 1929 Chance continued to use Crookes as a tradename into the 1960s. =Cathode ray tubes= Chance developed cathode ray tubes (CRTs) just before the outbreak of World War II. Using Hysil glass, a borosilicate glass similar to Pyrex, Chance became a major contributor to developing new methods for producing cathode ray tubes during World War II that were the precursors of CRT television screen. The tubes at that time were used for radar detection displays.Broadfield House Glass Museum, Kingswinford, Dudley Chance Brothers Glassworks, (Slide and Transcript no 13 by Arthur Reeves). =Precision bore tubing= Chance Bros developed precision bore glass tubing under the trade name Veridia in the 1950s.Journal of Scientific & Industrial Research Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (India) ‚Äì 1956 \\"THE PROCESS The Veridia process represents a real step forward in methods of fabricating glass.

(2009). \\"The oldest record of drepanosaurids (Reptilia, Diapsida) from the Late Triassic (Adamanian Placerias Quarry, Arizona, USA) and the stratigraphic range of the Drepanosauridae.\\" Neues Jahrbuch f√ºr Geologie und Pal√§ontologie, Abhandlungen, 252(3): 315-325. . The various species of drepanosaurid were characterized by specialized grasping limbs and often prehensile tails, adaptions for arboreal (tree-dwelling) and fossorial (digging) lifestyles, with some having also been suggested to be aquatic. Fossils of drepanosaurs have been found in Arizona, New Mexico, New Jersey, Utah, England, and northern Italy. The name is taken from the family's namesake genus Drepanosaurus, which means \\"sickle lizard\\", a reference to their strongly curved claws. Description Megalancosaurus preonensis restoration Drepanosaurs are notable for their distinctive, triangular skulls, which resemble the skulls of birds. Some drepanosaurs, such as Avicranium, had pointed, toothless, bird-like beaks. This similarity to birds may have led to the possible mis-attribution of a drepanosaur skull to the would-be \\"first bird\\", Protoavis.Renesto, S. (2000). \\"Bird-like head on a chameleon body: new specimens of the enigmatic diapsid reptile Megalancosaurus from the Late Triassic of northern Italy.\\" Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 106: 157‚Äì180. Abstract Drepanosaurs featured a suite of bizarre, almost chameleon-like skeletal features. Above the shoulders of most species was a specialized \\"hump\\" formed from fusion of the vertebrae, possibly used for advanced muscle attachments to the neck, and allowing for quick forward- striking movement of the head (perhaps to catch insects). Many had derived hands with two fingers opposed to the remaining three, an adaptation for grasping branches. Some individuals of Megalancosaurus (possibly exclusive to either males or females) had a primate-like opposable toe on each foot, perhaps used by one sex for extra grip during mating. Most species had broad, prehensile tails, sometimes tipped with a large \\"claw\\", again to aid in climbing. These tails, tall and flat like those of newts and crocodiles, have led some researches to conclude that they were aquatic rather than arboreal. In 2004, Senter dismissed this idea, while Colbert and Olsen, in their description of Hypuronector, state that while other drepanosaurs were probably arboreal, Hypuronector was uniquely adapted to aquatic life.Senter, P. (2004). \\"Phylogeny of Drepanosauridae (Reptilia: Diapsida).\\" Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 2(3): 257-268. The tail of this genus was extremely deep and non-prehensile ‚Äì much more fin-like than members of the more exclusive group Drepanosauridae.Colbert, E. H., and Olsen, P. E. (2001). \\"A new and unusual aquatic reptile from the Lockatong Formation of New Jersey (Late Triassic, Newark Supergroup).\\" American Museum Novitates, 3334: 1-24. Aerial locomotion has been attributed to at least two drepanosaur genera: Megalancosaurus and Hypuronector. The first was originally suggested by Ruben et al. 1998 on the basis of bird-like characters and limb proportions,Ruben, R. R. (1998). Gliding adaptations in the Triassic archosaur Megalancosaurus. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 18 (3), 73A. but while not ruled out entirely they have since been largely dismissed, due to the animal's more clunky, chameleon- like anatomy.Renesto, S. (2000). Bird-like head on a chameleon body: new specimens of the enigmatic diapsid reptile Megalancosaurus from the Late Triassic of Northern Italy. Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia (Research In Paleontology and Stratigraphy), 106(2). The latter, however, is much more likely a glider or flyer, due to the elongated forelimbs.Renesto, S., Spielmann, J. A., Lucas, S. G., & Spagnoli, G. T. (2010). The taxonomy and paleobiology of the Late Triassic (Carnian-Norian: Adamanian-Apachean) drepanosaurs (Diapsida: Archosauromorpha: Drepanosauromorpha): Bulletin 46 (Vol. 46). New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science. Fossorial, or at least digging-related adaptations have been demonstrated in three drepanosaur genera: Skybalonyx, Ancistronychus, and Drepanosaurus, the latter possibly being adapted to hook-and-pull digging, similar to modern-day anteaters and the former possessing claws similar in shape to modern-day moles and echidna, both of which are humeral-rotation diggers..Vallesaurus cenensis fossil Drepanosaurs have been difficult to pin down in terms of their phylogenetic position. Various studies have proposed that drepanosaurs are protorosaurian archosauromorphs, lepidosauromorphs related to kuehneosaurids, non-saurian diapsids related to weigeltisaurids, or (most recently) basal neodiapsids. = Early studies = When Drepanosaurus and Dolabrosaurus were first discovered (in 1980 and 1992, respectively), they were each considered early lepidosaurians, ancestral to modern lizards. Megalancosaurus was first believed to be a 'thecodont'(i.e. an archosauriform) upon its discovery in 1980, but later studies placed it as a 'prolacertiform', and perhaps even an ancestor to birds, although this latter hypothesis has not been supported by subsequent studies. = Drepanosaurs outside Neodiapsida: Avicephala and Simiosauria = A 2004 study by Senter placed drepanosaurs with the coelurosauravids (aka weigeltisaurids) and Longisquama in a clade called which he called Avicephala. Senter's analysis placed Avicephala within Diapsida but outside Neodiapsida, defined by Senter as the clade containing \\"all taxa phylogenetically bracketed by Younginiformes and living diapsids\\").Renesto, S. (1994). \\"Megalancosaurus, a possibly arboreal archosauromorph (Reptilia) from the Upper Triassic of northern Italy.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 14(1): 38-52. Within Avicephala, Senter named the group Simiosauria (\\"monkey lizards\\") for the extremely derived tree-dwelling forms. Simiosauria was defined as \\"all taxa more closely related to Drepanosauridae than to Coelurosauravus or Sauria.\\" However, Renesto and colleagues (see below) found drepanosaurids to lie within Sauria, which would make the clade Simiosauria obsolete. Senter found that Hypuronector, originally described as a drepanosaurid, actually lies just outside that clade, along with the primitive drepanosaur Vallesaurus. He also recovered a close relationship between the drepanosaurids Dolabrosaurus and Megalancosaurus. The following cladogram was found by Senter in his 2004 analysis. A clade containing drepanosaurids, Longisquama and Coelurosauravus (as well as Wapitisaurus) was also recovered in an earlier analysis conducted by John Merck (2003); however, in Merck's analysis this clade was nested within Neodiapsida, as the sister taxon of Sauria. Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus restoration Renesto and Binelli (2006) found that when pterosaur Eudimorphodon was added to Senter's (2004) original matrix it was found to be a member of Senter's Avicephala. The authors also conducted a second analysis, this time based on a character set and matrix updated by scoring additional characters previously reported as unknown and by adding a few relevant characters. This analysis recovered drepanosaurids as the sister taxon of Eudimorphodon; the clade containing pterosaurs and drepanosaurids was recovered as the sister taxon of Archosauriformes. Longisquama and Coelurosauravus were not found to be closely related to drepanosaurids, but instead were recovered as non-neodiapsid diapsid as in Senter's (2004) analysis. However, according to Renesto and Binelli it is feasible that this might be a result of poor knowledge of Longisquama rather than a reflection of its true phylogenetic position. The authors did note that there are similarities in the structure of forelimb and shoulder region of Longisquama and all or some drepanosaurids (e.g. both Longisquama and Vallesaurus have the fourth digit of manus as long as humerus); they stressed that they could not rule out that at least some of the similarities are convergent due to similar mode of life, and that they did not examine Longisquama firsthand, but stated that further studies of drepanosaurids should take the hypothesis that Longisquama might be a drepanosaurid into consideration. = Drepanosaurs as relatives of kuehneosaurids = Drepanosaurids were also found to be non-saurian neodiapsids in an analysis conducted by Johannes M√ºller (2004); however, in this analysis Drepanosauridae were not found to be closely related to Coelurosauravus, but rather they were recovered as the sister taxon of Kuehneosauridae. In a 2009 study Susan E. Evans conducted a phylogenetic analysis using a modified version of M√ºller's (2004) matrix. Evans also recovered Drepanosauridae as the sister taxon of the clade containing basal kuehneosaurid Pamelina and the rest of Kuehneosauridae; however, unlike in M√ºller's analysis, drepanosaurids and kuehneosaurids were recovered as non-lepidosaurian lepidosauromorphs. Evans did note that the two families share few synapomorphies, with M√ºller (2004) citing only two. One of them is the increased angulation of the zygapophyses in the posterior dorsal vertebrae; Evans noted that this character is also present in the skeletons of lizards belonging to the genus Draco, \\"and is likely to be functional (and thus potentially convergent)\\". The other one, the enclosed thyroid fenestra in the pelvis, \\"may be variable in the British kuehneosaurs and remains unknown in Pamelina\\", according to Evans. The author also noted that there are many differences between the skull of drepanosaurids and kuehneosaurids, and that the only skull characters shared by members of both families are primitive neodiapsid characters. = Drepanosaurs as archosauromorphs and the abandonment of Avicephala = Dilkes (1998) argued that drepanosaurs were close relatives of tanystropheids, and his phylogenetic analysis has been used by many other authors since his study. Gottmann-Quesada and Sander (2009) included one member of Drepanosauridae, Megalancosaurus, in their analysis of archosauromorph relationships; it was found to be one of the basalmost known members of Archosauromorpha and the sister taxon of Protorosaurus. In a later study Renesto et al. (2010)Silvio Renesto, Justin A. Spielmann, Spencer G. Lucas, and Giorgio Tarditi Spagnoli. (2010). The taxonomy and paleobiology of the Late Triassic (Carnian-Norian: Adamanian-Apachean) drepanosaurs (Diapsida: Archosauromorpha: Drepanosauromorpha). New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin. 46:1‚Äì81 demonstrated that Senter (2004) cladogram was based on poorly defined characters and dataset. The resulting phylogeny was therefore very unusual compared to any other previous study on drepanosaurs or related taxa. The new cladogram proposed in this last study abandoned both Avicephala (because it is polyphyletic) and Simiosauria. Senter's definition of Simiosauria included Sauria as an external specifier, causing the clade to become obsolete in Renesto et al.'s study (where drepanosaurs nested within Sauria). Renesto and colleagues instead defined a new clade, Drepanosauromorpha, as the least inclusive clade containing Hypuronector limnaios and Megalancosaurus pronenesis. Another more inclusive taxon, Elyurosauria (\\"lizard with coiled tails\\"), was erected, in order to include all the drepanosaurs with coiled tails, Vallesaurus is thus more derived than Hypuronector (as clearly shown by its morphology). Drepanosaurus and Megalancosaurus are also in a new taxon named Megalancosaurinae. The alternative cladogram presented in Renesto et al. (2010). Renesto et al. (2010) used modified versions of the matrices from the analyses of Laurin (1991) and Dilkes (1998) in order to determine the phylogenetic position of Drepanosauromorpha within Diapsida. The analyses using Laurin's (1991) matrix recovered drepanosaurs either as the sister group of the clade containing Prolacerta, Trilophosaurus and Hyperodapedon, i.e. Archosauromorpha, or in unresolved polytomy with Archosauromorpha and Lepidosauromorpha. The analyses using Dilkes's (1998) matrix recovered drepanosaurs either as \\"protorosaur\\" archosauromorphs and the sister taxon to the clade containing Tanystropheus, Langobardisaurus and Macrocnemus, or in unresolved polytomy with Lepidosauromorpha, Choristodera and several archosauromorph clades. Renesto et al. (2010) concluded that avicephalan synapomorphies proposed by Senter (2004) are merely evolutionary convergences caused by common lifestyle shared by drepanosaurids, coelurosauravids and Longisquama. The authors did not rule out the possibility that drepanosaurs and Longisquama might really be close relatives, but stated that additional data about Longisquama needs to be reported to test that. = Drepanosaurs as basal diapsids = Pritchard and Nesbitt (2017) employed a phylogenetic analysis in their description of Avicranium, a new genus of drepanosaur. This phylogenetic analysis found that Drepanosauromorpha was one of the earliest diverging groups of diapsids in the analysis, even more basal than weigeltisaurids (such as Coelurosauravus), tangasaurids (such as Hovasaurus), and younginids (such as Youngina). However, they were not found to be as basal as Petrolacosaurus, one of the earliest and most primitive diapsids known. Although drepanosaurs are only known from the late Triassic, this new finding suggests that the first members of the drepanosauromorph lineage evolved much earlier, in the Permian (about 260 million years ago).

Its flagship station is WRKO 680 in Boston, Massachusetts, on which the show airs every weekday between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. PM. It is syndicated live in five states, while Rhode Island's WHJJ broadcasts a best-of on Sunday evenings. The show can be accessed worldwide via live streaming, in both audio and video formats, on Carr's own website, HowieCarrShow.com. The video stream, known as the HowieCam, is an embedded YouTube broadcast. History Carr has hosted radio talk shows in Boston, Massachusetts, since the 1980s, briefly at WRKO/680 in late mornings, where he also shared an hour with liberal talk host Victoria Jones; then at WHDH/850; then (when WHDH became WEEI in 1994) back at WRKO. Video of Howie Carr and Grace Curley broadcasting from the Needham, MA studio He took over the afternoon drive-time slot from Jerry Williams, on whose show Carr often made appearances, originally during a segment called \\"The Governors,\\" with Williams and anti-tax advocate Barbara Anderson. National television networks occasionally record or simulcast the radio show following an event likely to provoke comments from callers. For example, on August 18, 1998, following a speech in which President Clinton admitted to some of the facts in the Lewinsky scandal, C-SPAN simulcast all four hours of the radio program.C-SPAN simulcast =Syndication= In September 1996, the show experimented with local syndication, sending the show out via ISDN connections to a group of stations around New England. The local experiment was such a success that, in January 1998, ABC Radio Today started syndicating the show nationally. The show did not sustain a large nationwide following and syndication was handed over to SupeRadio. In 2005, Entercom Communications, the owner of WRKO, took over syndication and the show was only offered to New England stations. Newsmax TV began broadcasting live, daily simulcasts of the show nationally in September 2016. =Relationship with Entercom= On July 9, 2007, Carr announced he would leave WRKO when his contract expired that September and would begin hosting a weekday morning drive-time program on FM station WTKK.\\"Carr Wars: Legal fight brews as Carr leaves WRKO in radio daze\\" - Boston Herald\\"Talk show host prepares move to rival\\" - Boston.com Greater Media, owner of WTKK, reportedly signed him for a five-year deal, though Entercom denies this happened.Carr files suit against WRKO for trying to stop new deal with rival ‚Äì BostonHerald.com On September 19, 2007, the show went on hiatus, as Carr's contract expired and a court barred him from moving to WTKK, whose contract offer WRKO had matched.\\"Ruling leaves Howie Carr in limbo\\" - Boston Herald On November 16, Carr resumed hosting on WRKO, under a contract expiring in 2012. Entercom used its option to extend the contract, announcing that Carr would be a fixture on WRKO for the \\"foreseeable future.\\" Carr often disparaged Entercom on the air, sometimes reacting to equipment failures by saying \\"Entercom happens\\" (adapting the fatalistic expression \\"shit happens\\"). Carr was suspended for the week beginning April 16, 2010 for such remarks,\\"WRKO suspends Carr for barbs against station\\" - Boston.com though the penalty was concurrent with a scheduled vacation.\\"Carr suspension 'no big deal' - Boston Herald Carr also disparaged the sports broadcasts that sometimes preempted the show (e.g. referring to the \\"very exciting Red Sox pre-game show\\" followed by a loud yawn sound effect) and WRKO's weak signal to the western suburbs in the evening. Carr's contract with WRKO expired in September 2014 and he moved to WMEX on November 17, 2014. In March 2015, he returned to WRKO, broadcasting from the Armstrong Advisory Group headquarters on Station Street in Needham, Massachusetts, but with the station being an affiliate instead of his employer. Worcester affiliate WCRN handles the distribution.Howie Carr: Talkers.com In the latter part of 2016 the show relocated to his current studio in the New Balance Building in Brighton. Carr took ownership of the program Affiliates other than WRKO retained the show and new affiliates in New Hampshire were added. As of his one-year anniversary as owner of the show, it had 24 affiliates in six states. =Web sites= Carr operates HowieCarrShow.com. He operated a predecessor \\"official\\" website at HowieCarr.us, between 2012 and 2013, as a place where listeners might check \\"in case anything happens to me,\\" implying a switch of stations on the completion of his contract with WRKO. Personnel Grace Curley during a live broadcast Grace Curley and Taylor Cormier are the co-executive producers of the show.\\"The Howie Carr Radio Network Promotes Two\\" - Talkers Mag , April, 5, 2018 The frequently referenced \\"Mail Room Manager\\" is Howie's wife, Kathy. Boston movie host Dana Hersey records the show's voice-overs and promotions. Formerly, Giles Threadgold was a sports announcer and sidekick. Show format The show is based on a monologue heavy on sarcasm and irony, with occasional interaction with producers, with which to encourage live caller participation. Invited guests are sometimes featured. Prior to the 2011 capture of Whitey Bulger, Carr's most common theme, as at the Boston Herald, was organized crime and elected officials, which he described in similar terms. After Bulger's incarceration, Carr's focus became more political in nature. Carr's language incorporates notorious local malapropisms, such as that of former city councillor Frederick C. Langone in referring to fresh vegetables not as crudit√©s but \\"CRUD-ites.\\" Commercial breaks occur, on average, every fifteen minutes; news reports every thirty minutes in five- minute durations. =Features=Chump Line Listeners can call Carr's voice mail service,Carr has stated that the format was copied by The Whiner Line of The Big Show on WRKO's sister station WEEI-FM. On Glenn Ordway's final day hosting that show, 15 February 2013, he denied the charge, saying that The Whiner Line began as a complaint line and was only later made a comedy feature based on the calls that came in. the \\"Chump Line\\". Selected messages are played shortly after the start of the show's third hour. The feature ends with a message, as might be heard on an answering machine: \\"Thank you for calling Howie Carr -- you chump!\\" The voice is that of a former summer intern named Trish; when originally recorded, Carr explained away the fact that she, not being a member of the AFTRA guild, was not permitted to work on-air. Hate Mail Monday On Mondays, Grace reads a selection of the \\"hate mail\\" the show has received in the prior week, with Howie and Taylor offering their ironic and sarcastic comments. Listener contests Carr occasionally dedicates segments or entire hours to contests for listeners to win prizes. The prizes are sometimes gift certificates from sponsors, but may be T-shirts or other materials promoting a book Carr has written, or other promotional gifts that WRKO has acquired. Carr sometimes sarcastically overstates the desirability of the prizes. Death Pool Video of Howie Carr introducing the Death Pool segment of his radio show The celebrity death pool is a contest where Howie asks listeners to guess the next famous person who will die. Elderly actors, politicians and musicians are the most popular choices but nobody is off limits. A celebrity death among the listener choices results in the declaration of a winner and the winner receives various prizes from Howie and/or his sponsors. Whenever someone wins the \\"death pool\\" Carr dedicates an entire hour to a new pool, in which callers can again select a person in the public eye who will be the next to die and a new list is compiled. Police Blotter Fax Fridays Each Friday, Grace reads police reports that listeners have submitted via fax or e-mail, and the show awards prizes for the two funniest entries. A favorite topic is crimes or incidents involving naked men or women, accompanied by a clip from Randy Newman's song \\"Naked Man\\". Catchphrases Carr often reads clips of current news, usually accompanied by his own sarcastic opinion. For example, news of crime involving rap or hip- hop artists, professional athletes, or politicians is often preceded by, \\"Try not to let the following news destroy your faith in the integrity of\\" the respective community. Stories about crime involving a vehicle or an unusual weapon elicit the line, \\"How many more must die, Mr. Speaker? How many more?\\"‚Äîa satire of legislators who stress the need to act before the next casualty. \\"Do you know who I am?\\" Often deployed with reference to members of the Kennedy family or other politically-connected individuals demanding favors or special treatment from law enforcement or other authorities after being caught committing an illegal or immoral act. Untimely deaths are treated with zeal with clich√©s or recurring newspaper headlines (\\"standing heads\\"): The victim \\"was turning his life around\\" or his mother said he was on the verge of becoming a rap artist. If a vehicle was involved, Carr may ask whether alcohol was a factor, as though composing a police report. That a person \\"won't be down for breakfast\\" is a favorite euphemism for death. Another frequent topic is the phenomenon of illegal aliens, especially when they receive preferential treatment. Carr's general support for the Republican Party allowed an exception for George W. Bush's guest worker proposal. When Bush explained that aliens \\"do the jobs that Americans won't do,\\" Carr began mocking Bush by appending to stories about crimes committed by illegal aliens a comment that \\"they are only here to commit the crimes Americans can't be bothered committing.\\" Carr often comments about proposals to regularize illegal aliens, such as with the DREAM Act, by stating, \\"I don't want any special favors; just treat me like an illegal alien.\\" Carr sarcastically uses common euphemisms for illegal aliens, such as \\"temporary guest worker\\" or \\"undocumented American.\\" Carr uses recurring slogans to give a cynical view of life in general: *\\"No good deed goes unpunished\\" refers to the apparent futility of doing good works. *\\"Never write if you can speak; never speak if you can nod; never nod if you can wink,\\" attributed to Massachusetts political boss Martin Lomasney, is used when a politician damages his own career with notorious disclosures. *\\"Nothing is on the level. Everything is a deal. No deal is too small\\" are Carr's \\"three rules\\" regarding lawmaking in Massachusetts. His corresponding theory on the state's judiciary is a quotation of Lenny Bruce: \\"In the Halls of Justice, the only justice is in the halls.\\" Carr uses irony, such as the line, \\"I'm shocked. Shocked!\\" (from the movie Casablanca) to describe something totally predictable; or that a politically guided personnel appointment was made \\"after a nationwide search.\\" When persuading someone, as with Honest Howie's Carbon Credits, he often says, \\"You can trust me: I'm not like the others.\\" When a caller delivers a rhetorical blow, Carr's signature retort is, after Red Buttons, \\"I didn't come here to be made sport of.\\" When current events induce him to gloat, he always precedes it with, \\"My heart feels like an alligator,\\" a line from Hunter S. Thompson's book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. =The voice-changer= Callers wishing to report unsavory or embarrassing details about themselves or others can request the \\"voice-changer.\\" Carr introduces \\"the Witness Protection Program of The Howie Carr Show,\\" adding, \\"Now no one will know your identity.\\" The \\"program\\" is a cheesy 1950s sci-fi sound effect that actually does nothing to obscure the caller's voice.

In 1827 he graduated from the University of Edinburgh, and subsequently became an eye surgeon at the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital. He was elected assistant-surgeon in 1832 and full surgeon in 1843. In 1850 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1851 a member of the council of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. Dalrymple is remembered for his histological work done with Henry Bence Jones (1814-1873) in the discovery of the albumin that was to become known as Bence Jones protein. This protein is often found in the blood and urine of patients with multiple myeloma. He published his findings in a treatise called On the microscopic character of mollities ossium.

It was filmed in black and white, and is widely considered a classic of Spanish cinema. The film won several awards, both in Spain and internationally. Plot Amadeo, an executioner in Madrid, meets Jos√© Luis, a funeral parlour employee who is going to pick up the prisoner that Amadeo has just executed. Jos√© Luis cannot find a girlfriend, since all girls leave him when they find out that he works in a funeral parlour. Amadeo's daughter, Carmen, cannot find a boyfriend, because all the candidates leave when they find out that her father is an executioner. Carmen and Jos√© Luis get to know each other and start a relationship that they declare to Amadeo when Carmen becomes pregnant. Amadeo hopes that the government will give him a flat (given that he is a civil servant), but they refuse it because by the time they give it to him, he will be retired. He and his daughter trick Jos√© Luis into accepting the role of executioner to keep the housing, assuring him that he won't have to kill anybody. When an order arrives for an execution in Mallorca, Jos√© Luis is horrified and wants to resign, but this would mean losing the flat and returning the salary he has earned. Amadeo and Carmen tell him to wait until the final moment, since the prisoner is ill and will surely die before being executed. At the end, in a memorable scene, Jos√© Luis is dragged to the garrote, as if he was the convict instead of the executioner.

It is frequently included with Goodbye to Berlin, another Isherwood novel, in a single volume, The Berlin Stories. Inspiration for the novel was drawn from Isherwood's experiences as an expatriate living in Berlin during the early 1930s,Isherwood (1945), \\"Preface\\" and the character of Mr Norris is based on Gerald Hamilton.Singh, p. 71 Isherwood began work on a much larger work he called The Lost before paring down its story and characters to focus on Norris. The book was critically and popularly acclaimed but years after its publication Isherwood denounced it as shallow and dishonest. Plot The novel follows the movements of William Bradshaw, its narrator, who meets a nervous-looking man named Arthur Norris on a train going from the Netherlands to Germany. As they approach the frontier William strikes up a conversation with Mr Norris, who wears an ill-fitting wig and carries a suspect passport. William and Mr Norris succeed in crossing the frontier. Afterward, Mr Norris invites William to dinner and the two become friends. In Berlin they see each other frequently (including eating ham and eggs at the first class restaurant of Berlin Friedrichstra√üe railway station). Several oddities of Mr Norris's personal life are revealed, one of which is that he is a masochist. Another is that he is a communist, which is dangerous in Hitler-era Germany. Other aspects of Mr Norris's personal life remain mysterious. He seems to run a business with an assistant Schmidt, who tyrannises him. Norris gets into more and more straitened circumstances and has to leave Berlin. Norris subsequently returns with his fortunes restored and apparently conducting communication with an unknown Frenchwoman called Margot. Schmidt reappears and tries to blackmail Norris. Norris uses Bradshaw as a decoy to get an aristocratic friend of his, Baron Pregnitz, to take a holiday in Switzerland and meet \\"Margot\\" under the guise of a Dutchman. Bradshaw is urgently recalled by Ludwig Bayer (based on Willi M√ºnzenberg)Miles (2010), p. 81 one of the leaders of the communist groups, who explains that Norris was spying for the French and both his group and the police know about it. Bradshaw observes they are being followed by the police and persuades Norris to leave Germany. After the Reichstag fire, the Nazis eliminate Bayer and most of Norris's comrades. Bradshaw returns to England where he receives intermittent notes and postcards from Norris, who has fled Berlin, pursued by Schmidt. The novel's last words are drawn from a postcard that Mr Norris sends to William from Rio de Janeiro: \\"What have I done to deserve all this?\\" Genesis Isherwood originally intended to call this novel The Lost, a title he conceived in German, Die Verlorenen. The title The Lost would have encompassed three different meanings: \\"those who have lost their way\\", by which he meant Germans who were being misled by Adolf Hitler; \\"the doomed\\", those like the character Bernard Landauer whom Hitler had already marked for destruction; and \\"those whom respectable Society regards as moral outcasts\\", like the characters Sally Bowles, Otto Nowak and Mr Norris himself.Isherwood (1976), p. 175 Isherwood began writing the book in 1934, while he and his companion Heinz Neddermayer were living in the Canary Islands. The Lost was initially planned as a much more comprehensive work, but Isherwood jettisoned much of the material and many of the characters, including Sally Bowles, the Nowaks and the Landauers, to focus on Mr Norris. This process he likened to the surgery performed to separate Siamese twins, \\"freeing Norris from the stranglehold of his brothers and sisters\\".Isherwood (1976), p. 178 The excised material formed the basis for the rest of his Berlin Stories. He completed work on the novel on 12 August of that year.Isherwood (1976), p. 188 Initially Isherwood planned to write the novel in the third person, but when he decided to narrow the novel's focus to Norris he changed to first person. He believed that this would allow the reader to \\"experience\\" Mr Norris as Isherwood had experienced Gerald Hamilton.Isherwood (1976), p. 184 The name of the narrator, William Bradshaw, is drawn from Isherwood's full name, Christopher William Bradshaw Isherwood. In subsequent novels Isherwood changed the narrator's name to \\"Christopher Isherwood\\", having come to regard \\"William Bradshaw\\" as a \\"foolish evasion\\". Isherwood did not explicitly claim that he was William Bradshaw although the novel describes Isherwood's own experiences. He sought to make the narrator as unobtrusive as possible so as to keep readers focused on Norris. Although Isherwood was living more or less openly as a homosexual, he balked at making Bradshaw homosexual as well. In part this was to help the average reader identify with the narrator by minimising the differences between the narrator and the reader. Not to do so meant that \\"The Narrator would have become so odd, so interesting, that his presence would have thrown the novel out of perspective. ... The Narrator would have kept upstaging Norris's performance as the star.\\" Isherwood's decision had a more pragmatic reason as well; he had no desire to cause a scandal and feared that should he cause one his uncle, who was financially supporting him, would cut him off. Yet Isherwood had no interest in making Bradshaw heterosexual either, so the Narrator has no scenes of a sexual nature.Isherwood (1976), pp. 184‚Äî86 The novel was still titled The Lost when Isherwood mailed the manuscript to Hogarth Press for publication, but the title was eventually changed to Mr Norris Changes Trains. Isherwood meant to evoke with that title not only Norris's continual moves from country to country to avoid his enemies and creditors, but also his constantly shifting political alliances and interests. Isherwood's friend Stephen Spender preferred the original title, saying of the new one that \\"It gives one the sense of earrings.\\"quoted in Isherwood (1976), p. 189 An employee at William Morrow and Company, Isherwood's American publisher, told Isherwood that no one in the United States would understand the term \\"changes trains\\" and so Isherwood supplied the alternate title The Last of Mr Norris.Fryer, p. 144 \\"He thereby created the false impression that these are two different novels, one the sequel to the other. Which ... led to much wearisome correspondence with readers, setting the record straight.\\"Isherwood (1976), p. 189 Isherwood's later disillusionment Although Mr Norris Changes Trains was a critical and popular success, Isherwood later condemned it, believing that he had lied about himself through the characterisation of the narrator and that he did not truly understand the suffering of the people he had depicted. In his introduction to an edition of Gerald Hamilton's memoir Mr Norris and I (1956) Isherwood wrote: > What repels me now about Mr Norris is its heartlessness. It is a heartless > fairy-story about a real city in which human beings were suffering the > miseries of political violence and near-starvation. The \\"wickedness\\" of > Berlin's night-life was of the most pitiful kind; the kisses and embraces, > as always, had price-tags attached to them, but here the prices were > drastically reduced in the cut-throat competition of an over-crowded market. > ... As for the \\"monsters\\", they were quite ordinary human beings prosaically > engaged in getting their living through illegal methods. The only genuine > monster was the young foreigner who passed gaily through these scenes of > desolation, misinterpreting them to suit his childish fantasy.quoted in > Fryer, pp. 146‚Äî47 NotesReferences * Fryer, Jonathan (1977).

The corporate name of the company is Madison Newspapers Inc. Capital Newspapers has nearly 300 employees. History The Wisconsin State Journal was first published on December 2, 1839 as The Madison Express, an afternoon weekly in Madison. It changed its name in 1852 to the Wisconsin Daily Journal in 1852 and to its current name in 1860. In 1919, the newspaper was sold to Lee Newspaper Syndicate (now Lee Enterprises) by publisher Richard Lloyd Jones. The Capital Times was founded in 1917 by the former managing editor of the Wisconsin State Journal, William T. Evjue. He quit the State Journal in the summer of 1917 after the newspaper abandoned support for Robert La Follette and his opposition to World War I. By December that year, he had raised enough funds to begin his own newspaper, an afternoon daily first published on December 13, 1917. Lee Enterprises and Evjue's The Capital Times Company began discussing a partnership that would operate both newspapers in 1947. The new partnership began on November 15, 1948 as Madison Newspapers, Inc. On February 1, 1949, the Wisconsin State Journal moved from afternoons to mornings and was the sole newspaper published on Sunday in the partnership. =Central Wisconsin acquisitions= Madison Newspapers and Lee Enterprises acquired Independent Media Group, Inc.'s newspapers in Nebraska and Wisconsin on July 1, 2000. Of the purchased newspapers, Lee Enterprises purchased 18 in both states and Madison Newspapers acquired 11 in Wisconsin. The newspapers purchased the Portage Daily Register, the Baraboo News Republic, the Shawano Leader, Reedsburg Times Press, the Juneau County Star-Times, the Wisconsin Dells Events, the Sauk Prairie Eagle, the Shopper Stopper, and the Wisconsin Reminder. Central Wisconsin Newspapers, Inc., a subsidiary of Madison Newspapers, was created to manage the newspapers. The Daily Citizen of Beaver Dam, two weekly newspapers, and five other publications were acquired by Central Wisconsin Newspapers, Inc., a subsidiary of Madison Newspapers, from Conley Publishing Group on April 1, 2002. =Name change= One year after completing the purchase of the Daily Citizen, Madison Newspapers changed its name to Capital Newspapers and integrated its two subsidiaries--Central Wisconsin Newspapers and Citizen Newspapers--in name only into the renamed company. The name change was strategic in order to identify itself as a regional newspaper company. According to the press release, the \\"change does not signal a significant reorganization and no job losses will occur because of this change. The newsrooms will remain separate and independent ....\\" =Sales to BlueLine= On October 3, 2006, Capital Newspapers completed the sale of the Shawano Leader and its commercial printing operations near Shawano to BlueLine Media Holdings LLC of Neenah. The Leader had a circulation of 6,500 daily and 7,200 on Sundays. =Printing press= The Capital Newspapers printing press also inks numerous publications in the Dane County region that are not owned by the corporation. Press room clients include various University of Wisconsin student-led newspapers, such as The Badger Herald which distributes 11,500 papers on Mondays and Thursdays and The Daily Cardinal which distributes 10,000 newspapers Monday through Thursday. =Wisconsin State Journal= The Wisconsin State Journal is a daily newspaper published in Madison, Wisconsin by Lee Enterprises. The newspaper, the second largest in Wisconsin, is primarily distributed in a 19 county region in south- central Wisconsin. As of September 2018, the Wisconsin State Journal had an average weekday circulation of 51,303 and an average Sunday circulation of 64,820. The staff of the Wisconsin State Journal were named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting in 2012 for their coverage of the \\"27 days of around-the-clock protests\\" at the state Capitol during the 2011 Wisconsin protests. Its editorial board was named a Pulitzer finalist in 2008 for its \\"persistent, high-spirited campaign against abuses in the governor's veto power.\\" =Founding= Founded by Madison Hotel proprietor William W. Wyman, the Madison Express was first published in Madison on December 2, 1839. The paper began as an afternoon weekly, but during legislative sessions would publish every other day. As a strong supporter of the Whig Party, the paper endorsed William Henry Harrison for president in 1840. =Atwood grows the paper= David Atwood was apprenticed as a printer with his brother's newspaper in Hamilton, New York before he arrived in Madison on Oct. 15, 1847. He soon became employed as a compositor and assistant editor at the Madison Express for $6 a week and board. He purchased the paper with partner Royal Buck in 1848, changing its name to the Wisconsin Express to expand its outlook.Wisconsin State Journal, December 11, 1932. He also established the paper editorially as an outspoken opponent of slavery.Wisconsin State Journal, February 27, 1921. In 1852 the weekly paper merged with Wyman's Wisconsin Statesman to become the Wisconsin Daily Palladium for three months. On Sept. 30, 1852 it changed its name again to the Wisconsin Daily Journal and to its current name in 1860.\\"Papers Long Ago\\". Milwaukee Sentinel, June 26, 1887. To bring in more revenue Atwood followed his brother's example in the east and began a lucrative sideline business of printing law books. Atwood took on partners to share ownership of the newspaper, including George Gary (1855‚Äì1856). In 1858, Atwood was commissioned a major general in the Wisconsin Militia by Governor Alexander W. Randall, but still retained financial interest in the daily. He also partnered with Harrison Reed (1859‚Äì1861), a former Milwaukee Sentinel editor who later became a carpetbag governor of Florida during Reconstruction. During Atwood's 41-year tenure as publisher, he was a state assemblyman (1861), an internal revenue assessor (1862‚Äì1866), a Madison mayor (1868‚Äì1869) and a U.S. representative to Congress (1870), all the while publishing the Wisconsin State Journal until his death in 1889. As mayor, Atwood sought to develop manufacturing in Madison, a position he could then applaud in his own paper.David V. Mollenhoff. Madison: A History of the Formative Years. Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003. =Becoming a Republican organ= In the early 1850s Atwood was aided by Horace Rublee, who had left the University of Wisconsin to be the legislative reporter for the Democratic Madison Argus. In 1853 he was associate editor of the Journal and the next year Atwood's business partner. Rublee was well positioned to participate in the new state politics that emerged in response to the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. As early as January 1854 the newspaper called for a mass convention of anti-slavery citizens to meet in Madison. After events such as slave Joshua Glover's liberation in Milwaukee and the birth of the Republican Party on March 20, 1854 in Ripon, WI intervened, the convention that founded the Wisconsin Republican Party was held at the capitol on July 13 with Rublee acting as party secretary and Atwood serving on the resolutions committee. Rublee later became the chairman of the state Republican Party from 1859‚Äì1869. In 1860 he extended an unsuccessful invitation to Abraham Lincoln to speak at the party convention in Madison. Rublee allied himself with Madison mayor, postmaster and state patronage boss Elisha W. Keyes to run the \\"Madison Regency,\\" the state's Republican machine. Rublee later broke with Keyes over the latter's support of President Andrew Johnson's vetoes of Freedman legislation.Richard N. Current. The History of Wisconsin, Volume II: The Civil War Era. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1976, pp. 573-575. J.O. Culver purchased Rublee's interest in the paper in 1868 after Rublee was appointed minister to Switzerland by President Ulysses S. Grant. Rublee later became editor of the Milwaukee Sentinel, while Culver retired in December 1876. On July 10, 1861, the State Journal became the first newspaper to produce and sell ready-printed \\"patent insides,\\" pages with Civil War news on one side but blank on the other, where the Baraboo Republic then printed its local news and advertising. Fostered by business manager John S. Hawks, this invention helped make many rural papers possible. During the 1870s, Hawks expanded the State Journal's printing of law books, picking up the contracts of a Chicago firm after it suffered a fire, and making the paper for a time the largest publisher of law books in the country.Wisconsin State Journal, 8-11-1925 The paper's presses were also used for much of the state government's printing. After Atwood's passing, the State Journal Printing Co. was formed as a stock company, with Horace A. ‚ÄúHod\\" Taylor taking over the paper. Although he had managed newspapers in La Crosse and Hudson, WI and Stillwater, Minnesota he was not a journalist, but instead used the paper to further his strong political ambitions. Taylor ran for governor as a stalwart Republican in 1888, losing the nomination to William D. Hoard. He ran for governor again in 1894, but lost the nomination to William H. Upham. He later held a consularship in Marseilles, France, as well as an appointment as U.S. Railroad Commissioner. =Becoming a progressive paper= During the 1890s, the paper's circulation began to catch up to its main rival, the Madison Democrat, due largely to the 1894 arrival of Yale-educated Amos Parker Wilder (father of playwright Thornton Wilder). Earning $30 a week as editor-in-chief, he later purchased a major interest in the paper. Wilder began to transform the State Journal into a more civic-minded newspaper, focusing on local problems but falling short of embarking on crusades. Originally a supporter of Governor Robert M. La Follette Sr. in 1900 and 1902, Wilder converted the paper's editorials to an anti-La Follette position for the price of $1,800, paid by a committee of seven Republican stalwarts fighting against La Follette's ultimately successful re-election in 1904.A. O. Barton. La Follette's Winning of Wisconsin. Madison, Wis.: 1922, p. 297. In 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Wilder U.S. consul to Hong Kong. In Wilder's absence, he put his business manager August Roden in charge, a typesetter who had come up through the ranks as reporter and later associate editor. Roden adopted the aggressive brand of muckraking journalism common to periodicals at the start of the 20th century. His greatest triumph began in 1907 with his crusade against the high rates and poor quality of Madison Gas & Electric's service. Following an almost daily barrage of damaging stories about the private utility, the State Journal hired an attorney to lodge a formal complaint with the state commission in charge of regulating gas and electric companies. In 1910 the paper succeeded in getting the state to force a reduction in MG&E;'s rates by nearly ten percent, setting a precedent that led to other rate roll-backs.David V. Mollenhoff. Madison: A History of the Formative Years. Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, pp. 296-302. Roden also oversaw the move of the State Journal in 1909 from a three-story limestone building at 119 East Washington Ave. to a new fireproof brick building located on South Carroll Street.William T. Evjue. \\"A Fighting Editor\\". 1968. In 1911, Richard Lloyd Jones, an associate editor at the muckraking magazine Collier's, became interested in buying the paper from Wilder. U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. encouraged this purchase to such a degree that he arranged for wealthy supporters of the progressive cause to lend Jones $85,000 of the $100,000 necessary to make the deal. Jones hired former State Journal reporter William T. Evjue as his managing editor. Jones ramped up the paper's already liberal views with hard-hitting, provocative editorials that attacked big business and brooked no compromise. Soon the State Journal was the leading progressive daily in Wisconsin.Belle Case La Follette and Fola La Follette. Robert M. Follette. New York: MacMillan, 1953. The paper made its first two endorsements of a Democrat for U.S. president (Woodrow Wilson, in 1912 and 1916), endorsing only three other Democrats for that office in its history. Under Jones the State Journal also became a steady advocate for Prohibition. By 1913, the paper's circulation had increased but the paper was on the verge of bankruptcy. Jones called back Evjue from his honeymoon to take on the job of business manager. Within ten days he'd reduced a payroll of $2,200 a week to $1,300 by cutting staff. The paper also sought loans from wealthy progressives.A Fighting Editor, by William T. Evjue, 1968, p. 224-227 New readers and advertisers were added with the help of a beefed up Sunday edition that included color comics, a pink sports section and a magazine supplement. Eventually circulation doubled. =World War I= In the spring 1918 primary election the State Journal urged readers to vote for Republican Irvine L. Lenroot for U.S. Senate instead of Sen. Robert La Follette's preferred candidate, James Thompson. As Congress debated entering World War I, Jones changed the paper's stance from one of pacifism to \\"preparedness.\\" Jones quickly soured on Sen. La Follette's stand against the war. He used the paper to viciously attack his former friend and hero in scathing editorials that accused him of being disloyal and a pro-German agent. La Follette responded by suing Jones and the State Journal for libel. Jones was later forced to recant these accusations during the subsequent trial in 1919. Editor Evjue could no longer tolerate the personal attacks on the senator's character, and in September 1917 he resigned. Three months later he founded the Capital Times, which became the State Journal's main competition for the next nine decades. As World War I raged on, Jones continued his virulent attacks on La Follette and anyone who supported him while heartily endorsing the formation of Loyalty Leagues. When La Follette criticized war profiteering by armaments manufacturers, Jones responded with charges of price-gouging by small local merchants, which drove some of those businesses to move their advertising to the Capital Times. In 1918 Jones' trumpeted his opposition to a La Follette-backed candidate for U.S. Senate, urging readers to \\"DECIDE STATE'S LOYALTY TODAY\\" in a blaring primary-day headline.Wisconsin State Journal, 3-19-1918 On July 19, 1919, Jones sold the State Journal to the Lee Newspaper Syndicate (now Lee Enterprises) of Davenport, IA, with A. M. Brayton becoming publisher and editor. In February 1921 the State Journal purchased its long-declining competitor, the Madison Democrat, ceasing its publication. =The formation of Madison Newspapers, Inc.= In June 1934, the State Journal and the Capital Times began to work in tandem by offering reduced advertising rates to clients who ran ads in both papers. The deal required the formation of two new corporations: the Wisconsin State Journal Co. and the Capital Times Co., both operating under the name Madison Newspapers. State Journal associate editor (and later publisher) Don Anderson regarded the agreement as \\"a shotgun wedding, conceived through the realization of both parties that we were broke.\\" The deal did away with many competitive practices, which put the company in danger of violating state and federal antitrust laws. The Department of Justice investigated the arrangement in 1944, but passed on making charges. By 1947, Lee Newspaper Syndicate and Evjue's The Capital Times Company, owner of The Capital Times, shared a need for new presses and larger facilities, along with concerns about rising production and labor costs. They discussed a new partnership that would allow them to share a printing plant, fix prices and combine profits. With both papers always published in the afternoon, one paper would have to move to morning distribution in order for them to share the same press. Since afternoons were then deemed a more profitable time to hit the streets and doorsteps, they agreed that whichever paper moved to mornings would become the sole publisher of a Sunday edition to make up for the predicted loss in circulation.Bill Lueders. \\"The MNI Story\\". Isthmus December 11, 1987. The new partnership began on November 15, 1948 as Madison Newspapers, Inc. On February 1, 1949, the Wisconsin State Journal moved from afternoons to mornings and was awarded the Sunday spot. The joint operating agreement between the two newspapers was further shielded by the federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which protected newspapers participating in such agreements from antitrust charges.Steven Korris. \\"Monopoly Journalism\\". Isthmus, October 1, 1982. =Supports Senator Joe McCarthy= The Wisconsin State Journal vociferously supported McCarthy throughout his political career, consistently defending his methods and attacking his detractors. The State Journal endorsed McCarthy every time he ran for state-wide office, five times in all, including three Republican primaries. The first time was in 1944, when McCarthy was little-known and challenged incumbent Republican Senator Alexander Wiley in the Republican primary. The State Journal was one of four papers to endorse McCarthy that year, the only one outside his home base in the Appleton area.Thomas C. Reeves, Tail Gunner Joe: Joseph R. McCarthy and the Marine Corps, The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Vol. 62, No. 4 (Summer, 1979), pp. 300-313 (p. 311 for endorsements). Setting the tone for later endorsements, the 1944 introduction was an effusive, admiring portrait taking up the better part of an entire page with two pictures and an account from McCarthy himself, trumpeting the \\"Tail-Gunner Joe\\" myth propagated by McCarthy based on a \\"commendation\\" he almost certainly forged.Thomas C. Reeves, Tail Gunner Joe: Joseph R. McCarthy and the Marine Corps, The Wisconsin Magazine of History, Vol. 62, No. 4 (Summer, 1979), pp. 300-313 (p. 304 for the forged commendation). The State Journal endorsed McCarthy in the Republican primary and general elections in 1952, writing just before the general election in 1952: > Sen. McCarthy, despite, some mistakes, has done the nation a service. He has > brought the anti-Communist fight out in the open, where it should be. He has > forced the reluctant administration to act against Communists and fellow- > travelers in the government and out. He has focused attention upon the > serious domestic issue of infiltration by Russian agents. And, despite his > critics and the most vicious personal attacks directed on a public figure in > our history, he has slowly but surely produced evidence about persons and > events ... evidence the American voters should have. \\"McCarthyism\\" has > encouraged our citizens to ask some penetrating questions of \\"important\\" > people, and demand honest answers.WisconsinState Journal, Oct 31, 1952. =The MNI strike= In 1976, Madison Newspapers, Inc. sought to upgrade its technology with the implementation of digital copy editing and typesetting. Without negotiating with the unions, MNI managers ordered the new equipment, and in April 1977 automated typesetting equipment was put into use. Seventeen printers were forced to give up their jobs and the wages of the remaining printers were cut by one third.Darryl Holter (ed.). Workers and Unions in Wisconsin. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1999, pp. 221-222. On October 1, 1977 the five local unions at the MNI plant went on strike, including the International Typographers Union, the Newspaper Guild, the Wisconsin State Journal Employees Association, the pressmen's union and the mailers' union. Striking employees had founded the Madison Press Connection, which survived for a year and a half as a general-interest daily before folding in January 1980. The strike was finally settled with the last two unions in December 1982, with MNI paying a total of $1.5 million in settlement costs and $1 million in legal fees while achieving a union-free plant.Jonathan Gladstone. \\"MNI Strike Settled at Last\\". Isthmus, December 17, 1982. =The Capital Times= The Capital Times (or Cap Times) is a digital-first newspaper published in Madison, Wisconsin by The Capital Times Company. The Capital Times formerly published paper editions Mondays through Saturdays. The paper ceased daily (Monday‚ÄìSaturday) paper publication with its April 26, 2008 edition. It became a primarily digital news operation while continuing to publish a weekly tabloid in print. Its weekly print publication is delivered with the Wisconsin State Journal on Wednesdays and distributed in racks throughout Madison. =Early years= The Capital Times began publishing as an afternoon daily on December 13, 1917, competing directly with the Wisconsin State Journal. The Cap Times founder, William T. Evjue, previously served as managing editor and business manager of the State Journal, a paper that had been a supporter of the progressive Robert La Follette, whom Evjue considered a hero. When La Follette began publicly opposing World War I, the pro-war State Journal abandoned La Follette. In response, Evjue abandoned the State Journal and formed his own newspaper, The Capital Times, one that would reflect the progressive views he espoused. The newspaper's motto was and continues to be \\"Wisconsin's Progressive Newspaper.\\" Rumors were spread that the new newspaper was editorially pro-German because of Evjue's support for the anti-war La Follette. As a result, shortly after publishing the first issue, The Capital Times faced an advertising boycott. Evjue, resolved to beat the boycott, visited nearby communities selling $1 subscriptions. By the summer of 1919, the newspaper had a circulation of over 10,000 and the advertising boycott ended. In November 1927, the paper launched a Sunday edition. During the 1920s, The Capital Times co-owned the left-leaning magazine The Progressive along with the La Follette family.Bernard A Weisberger,The La Follettes of Wisconsin: Love And Politics in Progressive America.Madison, Wis.:University of Wisconsin Press, 1994. (p.282) =Competition= Fierce competition continued between the Wisconsin State Journal and The Capital Times until 1948 when the newspapers could not afford to replace their aging equipment. After years of attempting to scoop each other and competing for advertising and circulation, the newspapers entered into consolidation talks in the hope of maintaining both newspapers. After tense negotiations, Lee Enterprises, owner of the Wisconsin State Journal, and Evjue's Capital Times Company formed Madison Newspapers, Inc. (now Capital Newspapers) on November 15, 1948, to operate both newspapers under joint agency. On February 1, 1949, the Wisconsin State Journal moved from afternoons to mornings and became the sole newspaper published on Sunday in the partnership. The Capital Times continued to publish on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings. = The Evjue Foundation = Following the death of its founder, William T. Evjue, in 1970, his controlling interest in The Capital Times Company was transferred to The Evjue Foundation, established a few years earlier to make small donations to worthy causes. As explained in a section of The Capital Times website devoted to the Foundation's history,Evjue Foundation - History Retrieved October 25, 2012. proceeds from Evjue's bequest \\"must go to organizations that best exemplify the beliefs that he championed during his lifetime, causes that could improve the quality of life for all the people in the Dane County area.\\" Accordingly, this bequest (initially valued at $13,450) makes the Evjue Foundation a major shareholder of The Capital Times Company. The foundation has donated more than $70 million since its inception. =Switch to digital focus = On February 7, 2008, with The Capital Times facing declining circulation (a problem facing the newspaper industry in general and afternoon dailies in particular), the paper announced it would cease daily print publication after April 26, 2008. From that point, it would focus on digital delivery at captimes.com as well as publish a widely distributed weekly print edition. The Capital Times appears weekly in a tabloid format (moving from its long-time broadsheet style) that is included with the Wisconsin State Journal and distributed free at newsstands in the Madison area. The move gained national attention as it involved a prominent daily newspaper shifting to full-time electronic news distribution while at the same time keeping a traditional (albeit non-daily) newspaper format. As part of the move, The Capital Times saw its staff reduced over time from about 64 to 20 positions. Capital Times executive editor Paul Fanlund took the title of editor and today is editor and publisher. Dave Zweifel became editor emeritus; Zweifel had been with the paper since 1962 and editor since 1983.  The Capital Times today = Philosophy = While The Capital Times is vigorously progressive in its editorial voice, there is a firm demarcation between its opinion voices and its news reporters and editors. The two parts act separately. = Events and podcasts = Since 2015, the Cap Times has hosted regular community events featuring live discussions about public affairs and cultural topics. Cap Times Talks, a monthly series, began in May 2015 and movie critic Rob Thomas has hosted regular post-film chats in local theaters since early 2015. Cap Times Idea Fest, a multi-day ideas festival on a wide variety of public affairs and cultural topics, launched in fall 2017 and has become an annual event since then. The Cap Times also produces regular podcasts around state politics (Wedge Issues), local public affairs (Madsplainers) and local dining (Corner Table).

Despite McGill University having a team in 1874,http://www.mcgillrfc.com/Team/history.html Westmount, which claims to have been established in 1876, is the oldest independent (as opposed to college-affiliated) rugby club in North America. Under the title of Montreal Football Club, the club played its matches at the McGill University grounds. The club gathered for social matches and occasions, and never really grew in size until it associated itself with the newly founded Montreal Amateur Athletic Association ‚Äì which was to become the premier sporting club at the turn of the century and figure prominently in the development of rugby in Montreal, Quebec, and ultimately the Dominion of Canada. The Montreal Amateur Athletic Association came into existence June 1881 and began as a confederation of three sporting clubs: The Montreal Snow Shoe Club, The Montreal Bicycle Club, and The Montreal Lacrosse Club. These founding clubs shared the club space of the Montreal Gymnasium, located at Mansfield Street and de Maisonneuve Boulevard. In 1884, the Montreal (Rugby) Football Club had upwards of 170 active members, and its first XV achieved an undefeated season, playing clubs from Royal Military College (Kingston), Ottawa, Quebec City, Toronto, British of New York, McGill University, and Bishop's University (Lennoxville, Quebec). The Montreal (Rugby) Football Club had used the McGill University grounds and the nearby Montreal Amateur Athletic Association facility as clubroom, even though it was not formally associated with the Association until 1885. Also in 1884, the Montreal (Rugby) Football club was instrumental in the formation of the Canadian Rugby Union. Three representatives from the Montreal Club were sent to meet with two representatives from the Toronto Rugby Football Club, and one from the Hamilton Rugby Football Club to meetings in Toronto and Montreal. It was decided that the union would continue to use the English rugby rules, and at the end of the season the winning club of the Quebec Championship would play the Ontario Champion for the Club Championship of the Dominion. With the amalgamation of the Montreal (Rugby) Football Club into the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in 1885, the club's grounds were shared with the Montreal Lacrosse Club in the city block downtown bound by Crescent Street, Sherbrooke Street, Bishop Street, and de Maisonneuve Boulevard. Matches were held at this ground only until 1888, when the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association moved its clubhouse to the Westmount Athletic Grounds at the junction of Saint Catherine Street and Hallowell Avenue, due to urban expansion into the downtown pitch and the subsequent dividing of the property into building lots. The Westmount property was landscaped and the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association laid down a cinder track, fences, six hundred yards of drainage, uprights, a pavilion, and a clubhouse. The pitch was, by today's standards larger than an international size rugby pitch. These grounds, aside from playing host to Montreal's rugby and lacrosse matches, also played host to Montreal's most popular sporting events such as bicycle races, athletics, ice hockey in winter, and in 1897 hosted the Jubilee Celebration of Queen Victoria's reign. At the turn of the century a new quarters was needed to accommodate a rapidly growing membership. In 1905, the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association clubhouse moved to Peel Street (where it currently resides), and the Westmount Athletic Grounds was retained as the club's official athletic grounds until July 1936. The economic depression inflicted severe financial problems upon the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association, and the property was therefore sold to the City of Westmount to help alleviate the economic hardships. In the meantime, rugby football had begun to make its split in North America. Between 1910 and 1920, American-style football gained in popularity; so popular that games were now played in front of larger capacities, and the football club soon split from the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association to form a semi-professional club. Rugby continued at the Westmount Athletic Grounds until 1959, when the Athletic facility was demolished to make way for Westmount High School, and a baseball diamond was built in the middle of the pitch rendering it unsuitable for rugby. Since its split from the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in the 1930s, the Rugby Football Club kept its colours of blue and white, but adopted the new name of The Montreal Scottish RFC, owing to its strong Scottish influence within the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association. For years, the Montreal Scottish RFC were the premier rugby club of Quebec, winning almost everything they could possibly arrange to compete for. By the 1950s, the Montreal Scottish RFC could not accommodate the vast number of players wishing to join the club, and they took on a ‚ÄúScottish-only‚Äù policy by turning away many non-Scottish players. These ‚Äúexiled‚Äù players eventually formed local clubs such as The Montreal Wanderers Rugby Football Club and The Montreal Barbarians Rugby Club. Soon after, noting that this ‚ÄúScottish-only‚Äù policy was not sustainable, the club policy became open to all players of all backgrounds, and the club name changed to the Westmount Rugby Football Club, named after the municipality where its home field had been located for most of its history. With the demolition of The Westmount Athletic Grounds, the club moved its grounds to the nearby Villa Maria High School, before settling at Westmount Park located in the heart of the city of Westmount. By 1976, the Quebec Rugby Union had grown to six clubs (Ormstown RFC, Montreal Irish RFC, Montreal Wanderers RFC, Montreal Barbarians RC, Town of Mount Royal RFC and Westmount RFC), and Westmount RFC had changed its colours to maroon and white. Also adopted was the raven as a club symbol, owing from the municipal crest of the city of Westmount, where it figures prominently. The club became officially incorporated in 1976. The club wore maroon jerseys with white shorts until 1997, when it was decided to incorporate black into the uniform. Black shorts were introduced for 'exhibition matches' and the club began to use them regularly afterwards. The club continues to play in the B Division of the Rugby Quebec, winning the C division championship in 2011. The home field is Westmount Park field, in Westmount. It currently has one competitive men's team, one social men's team, one women's competitive/social team, a juniors program and a minis program. In 2016 the women's team had an undefeated season and won the Development Division Championship. In 2017 they were promoted to the next higher division.

The title character's true name is Fred Peloux, but he is known as Ch√©ri to almost everyone, except, usually, to his wife. This novel was followed by a sequel, La Fin de Ch√©ri, published in 1926. Plot summary The novel opens with an exchange between L√©a and Ch√©ri. They are physically involved, and they argue while Ch√©ri plays with L√©a's pearls and thinks on her age. He mentions his marriage prospects, but she seems to take this in stride as they believe their relationship is casual. They have been involved for around six years, and she is forty-nine while he is twenty-five. L√©a alternatingly obsesses over getting old and celebrates what she has done and who she has had in her life while demonstrating no remorse over her life as a courtesan. As they often do, the pair playfully fight before making up, and he runs off to meet his potential bride, Edm√©e. Edm√©e is revealed to be a reticent girl with a boisterous, rude mother (Marie-Laure). At this point, there are flashbacks through the course of their relationship. L√©a considers Ch√©ri's mother, Charlotte, a competitor but she also appears to be one of her closest friends. When Ch√©ri was nineteen, L√©a mentioned taking a trip to the country. She and Ch√©ri argue a little, kiss and make up, and travel together to Normandy where they stay for several months as lovers. At times she thinks that he is so distant, he might as well speak another language. After attempting to have him trained in boxing, the text flashes forward to a more recent time. Ch√©ri is telling L√©a of his upcoming marriage to Edm√©e and is disappointed by her lack of response. Notably, his mother and Edm√©e's mother are at war over the couple's future financial arrangements. After their marriage, Ch√©ri is notably depressed. L√©a takes her leave without telling anyone where she is going or when she will come back. Ch√©ri does not take this news well and wishes constantly to know more while reflecting on the shocking youth of his young (nineteen year old) bride and comparing her with L√©a. After an argument with Edm√©e, Ch√©ri goes for a late night walk and eventually ends up with a friend, Desmond. He has Desmond call his house for him and tell them first that he is having dinner and then that he is staying with Desmond for the night. He does not return home for months though. In this time period, he repeatedly thinks of going home or of divorce, yet he does neither. He pays Desmond for his services, yet he never actually sleeps with the women or does the drugs that are provided. In his absence, Edm√©e writes him to say that she will wait at their home for further instructions. After having been gone for six and a half months, L√©a returns. This spurs Ch√©ri to buy apology gifts and actually return home to his young wife (who happily accepts his return after his three months' absence). It is revealed that L√©a had some lovers while she was away; however, she seems uninterested in most of her old habits once she has returned to Paris. Realizing she is being ridiculous, she begins trying to make plans to keep her mind from her longing for Ch√©ri. Not long afterward, Ch√©ri turns up on L√©a's doorstep she lets him in. He declares he is here to stay and they realize their relationship was one of love. They have sex that night. After awakening, she begins to plan for them to escape Paris discretely together; however, there seem to be some prior feelings that they cannot move beyond. They begin to argue, and he must remind her of what a kind woman she typically is and how she is supposed to care for others. He admits that he has been obsessed with seeing her again and could not move past her. Although this may be true, in the light of morning, he sees how she has aged tremendously and realizes that the L√©a he longed for is gone. Heartbroken, she thanks him for finding her beautiful and worthy for so long. She says he should blame her for all that is wrong with him, and sends him home to his wife despite longing to do otherwise. As he walks away, she excitedly thinks he may turn around; however, he does not. The novel ends with his back to her as he leaves and him filling his lungs with air the way an escaped convict might. Adaptations The novel has been adapted to film twice, in 1950 and 2009; and television twice, in 1962 and 1973. The ballet of Ch√©ri premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in September 1980. The ballet was choreographed by Peter Darrell, while the music was composed by David Earl. The ballet was danced by the Scottish Ballet with the lead roles of L√©a and Ch√©ri danced by Patrick Bissell and Galina Samsova. The set was designed by Philip Prowse. This ballet was revived by the Hong Kong Ballet in 1989. =Ch√©ri (the film)= The novel has been adapted to the silver screen by Stephen Frears in 2009, with Rupert Friend as the young Ch√©ri and Michelle Pfeiffer as L√©a. Christopher Hampton wrote the screenplay.

The DAP had a Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architecture with 64x64 single bit processors. DAP FORTRAN had the following major features: * It had matrix and vector operations. * Assignments could be performed under a logical mask so only some elements in the target of an assignment were changed. * On the negative side - operations were performed using the size of the underlying hardware i.e. on a 64x64 matrix or 64 element vector. In a declaration either one or two extents could be omitted as in: C Multiply vector by matrix REAL M(,), V(), R() R = SUM(M*MATR(A)) C Converge to a Laplace potential in an area REAL P(,), OLD_P(,) LOGICAL INSIDE(,) DO 1 K = 1, ITERATIONS OLD_P = P P(INSIDE) = 0.25*(P(,+)+P(,-)+P(+,)+P(-,)) IF (MAX(ABS(P-OLD_P)) .LT. EPS) RETURN 1 CONTINUE The omitted dimension was taken as 64, the size of one side of the DAP. The speed of arithmetic operations depended strongly on the number of bits in the value. INTEGER*n reserved 8n bits where n is 1 to 8, and REAL*n reserved 8n bits where n is 3 to 8. LOGICAL reserved a single bit. However, DAP FORTRAN fell between two conflicting objectives. It needed to effectively exploit the DAP facilities. But also had to be accessible to the scientific computing community whose primary language, with a design closely tied to serial architectures, was FORTRAN. The dialect used was ICL's 2900-series FORTRAN which was based on an early version of the FORTRAN 77 standard and had mismatches with both FORTRAN 77 and the older FORTRAN 66 standard. DAP FORTRAN was significantly different from either standard FORTRAN and the machine was not capable of accepting or optimising standard FORTRAN programs. On the other hand, compared with other contemporary languages which were by design extensible (notably ALGOL-68), FORTRAN was less than well suited to this task. The result was noticeably inelegant and did require a great deal of new learning. Operationally, there was an overhead to transfer computational data into and out of the array, and problems which did not fit the 64x64 matrix imposed additional complexity to handle the boundaries (65x65 was perhaps the worst case!) - but for problems which suited the architecture, it could outperform the current Cray pipeline architectures by two orders of magnitude. A later version of the DAP used Fortran-Plus instead which was based on FORTRAN 77 and had more flexible indexing. In particular it automatically mapped user sized arrays onto the underlying hardware.

It was first published Measure 26 (Apr. 1923)Cook, p. 55 and is therefore under copyright, however it is quoted here as justified by fair use in order to facilitate scholarly commentary. The poem's speaker is unhappy about the choice of bananas as a table decoration, complaining that they don't match well with the eglantine and are suitable only for a room of women who are all shanks and bangles and slatted eyes. Recommended instead are plums in an eighteenth-century dish, centering a room in which there would be women of primrose and purl. Interpretation This poem finds Stevens, the cool master as Yvor Winters described him, in warm good humor, putting the world's raw material in tension with imagination's desire for a sophisticated construct. The raw bananas don't quite succumb, and there is a suggestion that this is not a bad thing, if only to provide energy and impetus for imagination's renewal. Alternatively, the poem can be interpreted as about the dangers of blatant sexuality and Stevens's \\"fear of the force of female sexuality\\". Surely Marianne Moore had this poem foremost in mind when she compared Stevens's efforts in Harmonium to Henri Rousseau's paintings. There is lushness and sexuality in both. The poetic device that Robert Buttel noted in connection with \\"The Apostrophe to Vincentine is at work here too\\", in what Eleanor Cook, following art historian Ernst Gombrich, calls inverted recognition, \\"the recognition not of reality in a painting but of a painting inreality\\".

He is most famous for his work in the Roman Forum. Life Born in Venice, Boni studied architecture at the Accademia di Belle Arti in his native city and later moved to Rome. During World War I Boni participated as a soldier, and was elected senator in 1923, at which time he embraced fascism. Boni died in Rome, and he is buried in the Orti Farnesiani on the Palatine Hill. Work=Venice= His early work as an architect involved him in the restoration of the Doge's Palace. During this time he demonstrated his technical skills. In the 1880s, Boni met Horatio Brown, who became his colleague in a shared passion for antiquities.Sandro Consolato, 'Giacomo Boni, l'archeologo-vate della Terza Roma', in 'Gianfranco De Turris, Esoterismo e Fascismo (2006) =Rome= In 1888 Boni went to Rome, where in 1898 the Ministro della Pubblica Istruzione G. Baccelli named him director of excavations in the Forum Romanum. Boni directed this important project from 1898 until his death in 1925. He was interested in the stratigraphy of the Forum, an important advance in the science of Roman archaeology. His excavations led to many important discoveries, including the Iron Age necropolis near the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, the Lapis Niger, the Regia, Galleria Cesaree, Horrea Agrippiana, the shrine of Vesta, and other monuments. In 1907 Boni also worked on the slope of the Palatine Hill where he discovered the Mundus (tholos-cistern), a complex of tunnels leading to the Casa dei Grifi, the so-called Aula Isiaca, the so-called Baths of Tiberius and the base of a hut under the peristyle of the Domus Flavia. The excavations were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I and resumed in 1916. Giacomo Boni in his study Roman religion and fascism Boni developed a strong interest in the ancient Roman religion and wished to see it revived and some of its rituals restored and adopted by the Italian state. When the National Fascist Party came to power he viewed it as a chance for a pagan revival. He viewed fascism as connected to ancient Rome and agreed with Benito Mussolini's claim that fascism was a sort of continuation of the Roman Empire. Mussolini in turn supported Boni and appointed him as a senator. Boni's role in fascism would however not last long, as he died in 1925 and only lived through a few years of the fascist state. He was buried on the Palatine hill in an extraordinary ceremony organized by the regime. He is considered an early figure in what scholars later would label as \\"sacred fascism\\".Francesco Buscemi (2019). \\"The Sin of Eating Meat: Fascism, Nazism and the Construction of Sacred Vegetarianism\\".

His son, R. J. Hunter, was a first-round draft pick for the Boston Celtics. He currently plays for the College Park Skyhawks of the NBA G League. High school Hunter attended and played for Chaminade-Julienne High School in Dayton, Ohio from 1978 to 1982. Coaching career=IUPUI= From 1994 to 2011, Hunter served as the head coach at IUPUI.Ron Hunter leaves IUPUI to be coach at Georgia State - ESPN Under his direction, the team advanced from an NAIA program to NCAA Division I. In its third season as a Division I program, Hunter led IUPUI to its first, and thus far only, NCAA tournament appearance in 2003. On January 24, 2008, Hunter coached a game against Oakland University while barefoot. He did this to benefit Samaritan's Feet, a foundation that works to provide hope and love to impoverished children around the world by washing their feet and giving them a new pair of shoes. His goal was to collect 40,000 shoes, however, before tip-off, over 110,000 pairs of shoes had been donated. =Georgia State= On March 21, 2011, it was announced Hunter would replace Rod Barnes as the Georgia State Panthers' men's basketball head coach. During his first season at GSU, Georgia State won 22 games, the fourth most in school history. The moment many know Hunter for happened in the 2015 NCAA Tournament. Coach Hunter tore his Achilles celebrating the Panthers' Sun Belt Conference Tournament championship. Because of his injury, he was forced to coach their subsequent NCAA appearance from a stool. In their second-round game against the three-seed, Baylor, Hunter's son R.J. hit a deep, game-winning three with seconds left on the clock. When the shot went in, Hunter's rolling stool slipped out from under him while celebrating. The moment spurred a torrent of media attention and resulted in multiple features, interviews, and a spot in 'One Shining Moment' at the conclusion of the tournament. On November 20, 2017, in a win over Eastern Washington, Hunter earned his 400th career win. Ron Hunter has played a key role in the ongoing transformation of the athletics culture at Georgia State, particularly with the basketball program and their continuing ascension from being one of the most unsuccessful programs in NCAA Division I history to being one of the premier Mid-Major programs in the nation. Some of Ron Hunter's most notable wins as head of coach of Georgia State are: VCU (2011), #16 Baylor (2015), Georgia (2018) and Alabama (2018). Hunter also notched a win against crosstown foe, Georgia Tech, in a 2017 charity exhibition known as the 'A-Town Showdown for Hurricane Relief'. =Tulane= On March 24, 2019, Hunter was named the head coach at Tulane, replacing Mike Dunleavy.

The series was centered on the superhero Neutron, and his fianc√©e Valentina was featured as a supporting character. The following story, I sotterranei published in February 1966, explored the origins of its main character, but subsequently became demoted to a peripheral character, as the series briefly was entitled Neutron/Valentina, and eventually Valentina by the end of 1967. Fictional character biography Neutron is the alter ego of Philip Rembrandt, an art critic who since his youth has had the ability to paralyse people simply by meeting their gaze. He is revealed to be the descendant of a subterranean race from the city of Komyatan. As an amateur investigator, Neutron solves some bizarre mysteries, but the few stories ultimately served as an introductory prequel for the photographer Valentina Rosselli, who became the main protagonist of stories of a different genre, and one of the most famous European comics characters.

Its alumni include politicians, lawyers, bishops, poets, and academics. Some went on to become fellows of the college; 14 students later became principal of the college. It was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I, at the request of a Welsh clergyman, Hugh Price, who was Treasurer of St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. The college still has strong links with Wales, and about 15% of students are Welsh. There are 340 undergraduates and 190 students carrying out postgraduate studies. Old members of Jesus College are sometimes known as \\"Jesubites\\". From the world of politics, the college's alumni include two Prime Ministers (Harold Wilson of Britain and Norman Manley of Jamaica), one Speaker of the House of Commons (Sir William Williams), a co-founder of Plaid Cymru (D.

Unlike many of her class, which received only numbers and were disposed of after World War II, she survived long enough to be named. On 1 July 1955, all LSTs still in commission were named for US counties or parishes; LST-1068 was given the name Orange County, for counties in the states of California, Florida, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia, she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction LST-1068 was laid down on 31 January 1945, at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard; the ship was launched on 3 March 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Alice R. Wilbur; and commissioned on 27 March 1945, with Lieutenant Clinton E. Voyles, USNR, in command. Service history=World War II= After shakedown in Chesapeake Bay, LST-1068 loaded pontoon causeways and LCT sections at Davisville, Rhode Island, and embarked men at New York prior to getting underway, on 11 May, for the Pacific via the Panama Canal. On 27 June, she departed Pearl Harbor for Guam via Eniwetok. LST-1068 cleared Apra Harbor, Guam, with a group of LSTs on 11 August, en route to Saipan. From Saipan she returned to Okinawa, arriving on 28 August 1945. She was forced out to sea from her anchorage on 16 September, to ride out a violent storm which lasted for three days and nights. On 22 September, she loaded elements of the Fifth Air Force for transport to Yokohama, Japan. After discharging the Air Corps personnel on 27 September, LST-1068 sailed on 1 October, from Tokyo Bay, for the little port of Ominato, where she was to drop off a Port Director Unit. On 12 October, she was underway again bound for Manila via Yokohama. Arriving in Manila Bay on 26 October, LST-1068 remained for five days and then moved to Batangas and loaded occupation troops to return to Tokyo. She arrived in Tokyo on 14 November. On 28 November, at Saipan, LST-1068 exchanged low-point crew members for high-point personnel of other LSTs and on 14 December, she sailed for Pearl Harbor. From Pearl Harbor she was ordered to San Francisco for pre-deactivation overhaul and then to Bremerton, Washington, for decommissioning. LST-1068 decommissioned on 9 August 1946, and was placed in reserve at Astoria, Oregon. =Korean War= LST-1068 at sea, date and location unknown. Recommissioned on 8 September 1950, LST-1068 went through her second shakedown cruise and then sailed to the Far East via San Diego. Her actual departure was delayed, however, while she underwent repairs for a hole torn in her bottom by striking a submerged LCI. Repaired and loaded, she sailed in January 1951, with a scheduled stop at Pearl. In February, LST-1068 arrived in Yokosuka, and the following month she made her first entrance into Korean waters. Through May, she was engaged in operations at Inchon, and in June, was on her way back to the US. Following overhaul, training and upkeep, which lasted for several months, she returned to the Far East in January 1952. LST-1068 carried out a rigorous schedule which kept her busy until October, landing troops and supplies and shipping prisoners. She participated in operations at Sokchori, Koje-do, and Wonsan, with brief but frequent trips to Pusan, Cho-do, and Yokosuka, Japan. LST-1068 returned to the US again in October, arriving in San Diego around Thanksgiving. The s:Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on 27 July 1953, at the time that LST-1068 was preparing for her third deployment. =Post-war= She departed San Diego, on 1 August, with the landing craft repair ship and . Arriving in Japan on 21 September, and following a three-week stay at Yokosuka, she proceeded to Kobe, and then to Sasebo. During November, she participated in a series of training exercises at Tokchok-to, Korea, an island near Inchon. In January 1954, LST-1068 conducted training at Okinawa, and in March, at Iwo Jima, she was involved in the largest training operation she had ever experienced. On 17 June, she joined with five LSTs of LST Division 13, for a return passage to San Diego. Upon arrival she was assigned primarily local operations and periods of upkeep. December 1954 and January 1955, were spent in overhaul at San Pedro, California. The ship was renamed Orange County on 1 July 1955. Decommissioning Orange County continued to provide a vital service to the Navy until she decommissioned on 15 October 1957. The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 September 1957, and subsequently sunk as a target ship on 18 June 1958. Awards LST-1068 earned four battle stars for her Korean War service.

He pitched in Major League Baseball from 1998 to 2002. Career Yoshii played in the Koshien high school baseball tournament twice and joined the Kintetsu Buffaloes as the second round pick in the 1983 draft after graduating from the same elementary, middle, and high schools as former Seibu Lions manager, Osamu Higashio. After spending some time in the minors, he marked his first victory in 1987, and in 1988, he won 10 games and saved 24 games, which won him the Pacific League relief pitcher title. He won five games and marked another 20 saves his next year. In 1993, he became a starter. In 1995, he was traded to the Yakult Swallows and won more than 10 games a year for three straight years. In the 1997 off-season, he became a free agent and signed with the New York Mets. Yoshii agreed to a two-year extension worth $5 million with the Mets in November 1998. He was traded to the Colorado Rockies in 2000, for Bobby Jones. In September, Yoshii underwent surgery to remove bone spurs from his elbow. Two months later, he agreed to a new contract with the Rockies for the 2001 season. The team tried to trade him before the season started, but eventually released Yoshii, who then signed with the Montreal Expos in March 2001. He had surgery on his left shoulder in September 2002. In 2003, Yoshii returned to Japan, joining the Orix BlueWave. He was the team's opening-day starter that year but had surgery on his left ankle in August; he ended the season with only two wins. He played in only three games in 2004 and was cut from the team at the end of the year. The Orix BlueWave merged with the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes during the off-season to form the Orix Buffaloes, and Yoshii ended up joining the Buffaloes for spring training and won six games in the 2005 season. In 2006, Yoshii marked a win against the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, becoming the fifth player in to have recorded victories against 12 Japanese professional baseball teams. On April 1, 2007, he gave up two grand slams in one inning against the Rakuten Eagles, but the third baseman, Greg LaRocca, had committed an error before loading the bases, giving Yoshii the irregular record of 8 runs given up, but 0 earned runs. On April 25, 2007, the 42-year- old Yoshii started the game against the Rakuten Eagles with 18-year-old Masahiro Tanaka as the opposing pitcher and recorded a win giving up 1 run over 5 innings of pitching. This made him the sixth Japanese pitcher to have recorded a win at or above age 42, after Shinji Hamasaki, Tadashi Wakabayashi, Yoshinori Sato, Yutaka Ohno, and Kimiyasu Kudoh. He continued to pitch during the season as a starter but was demoted to relief duty by manager Terry Collins after several poor performances. Yoshii requested to be traded to another team where he could continue to start and was sent to the Chiba Lotte Marines on June 28 in exchange for an outfielder. His pitching continued to decline, and he ended the season with a 1‚Äì9 record before being demoted to the minors. He was released by the Marines on November 13, and announced his retirement to become a pitching coach for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters under manager Masataka Nashida.

History This is the third occurrence of the use of South Dakota 52 since 1926. The first SD 52 was located in the southwest portion of the state, designated in the mid-1920s. It extended from Oelrichs east to Oglala. It was used until 1950, when U.S. Highway 18 was rerouted onto this road. In the early 1950s, there were two new, separate segments of SD 52. One was in the extreme southwest corner of the state. It began at U.S. 18 in Edgemont, and ran southerly to meet what is now South Dakota Highway 71 near Rumford. This road was renumbered as South Dakota Highway 471 in 1976. The second 1950's segment of SD 52 was the current alignment.

The line currently runs from the intersection of North Avenue and St. Paul Street to Curtis Bay, with selected trips to Energy Parkway and Riviera Beach. The line also serves Federal Hill, Port Covington, and Brooklyn. The bus route is the successor to the 6 Curtis Bay streetcar line. History Route 64 started operating in 1977 after a line known as Route 6 was split into several other lines. Its route has a history of being served by streetcars. The No. 6 Curtis Bay Streetcar started operating in 1892. In 1929, the route was extended east from downtown Baltimore to Patterson Park. The line was extended again in 1935 to Orangeville after absorbing the eastern portion of the No. 4 Streetcar Line (a service presently provided on the west side by bus route 15 and on the east side by bus route 35). In 1948, the Curtis Bay-East Monument Street line was converted to a bus.Routes of Baltimore Transit - 1900 to Today In 1959, Bus Route 6 absorbed Bus Route 29, the line that had operated between Roland Park and downtown (a service now provided by Route 61).Routes of Baltimore Transit - 1900 to Today While all trips had operated from Curtis Bay, the line had two branches from downtown: one to the east along Monument Street, and one to the north to Roland Park. This alignment continued for the next 18 years. In 1977, Route 6 was split into four new routes. A new Route 61 was formed that operated and still operates to this day from Roland Park to downtown. A new Route 62 operated from Monument Street to downtown. (Route 62 was extended to serve Armistead Gardens and Hollander Ridge and was eventually incorporated into Route 35). A new Route 63 was formed that operated from Riviera Beach to downtown. And Route 64 started operating from Curtis Bay to downtown, with branches serving Wagner's Point, Maryland Drydock, Davison Chemical, and various other places in the area. Routes 63 and 64 overlapped for much of the route within the city. The Route 63 bus that was formed in 1977 was not the first. A new bus route designated Route X, the highest lettered route in Baltimore transit history, started operating in 1946. It was renamed to Route 63 in 1948. This route operated until 1951, when it was absorbed into Route 6.Obscure Routes and Operations in Baltimore Transit Routes 63 and 64 that had been formed in 1977 continued to operate in this fashion until 1993, when changes started to be made. In January 1993, Route 63 was modified to feed into the Patapsco Light Rail Stop rather than going to downtown Baltimore.MTA Winter 1993 schedule changes Later the same year, when the light rail was extended further south, it was modified again to feed into the North Linthicum Light Rail Stop, and selected trips on Route 63 continued north to the Patapsco stop, replacing a branch of Route 64 that had served Linthicum.MTA September 1993 schedule changes The Davison Chemical branch of Route 64 was eliminated due to low ridership, but Route 63 continued to pass the entrance to the plant. In 1996, Routes 63 and 64 were combined, and selected Route 64 trips were extended to Riviera Beach and Energy Parkway. No replacement service was provided for the portion of Route 63 in the Linthicum area, though many parts of the route are within a close walk of the light rail. Route 64 from this day on has provided all service for the corridor. In 2003, Route 64 was shortened to Curtis Bay. Service between Curtis Bay and Wagner's Point was provided on a new Route 65, which operated between the Patapsco Light Rail Stop and Wagner's Point. This change was made due to a temporary road closure.Routes of Baltimore Transit - 1900 to Today But Route 65 was eliminated in 2005 as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative due to low ridership,Highlights of proposed bus route changes - latimes.com and currently, no bus service operates to this area. Only 20 daily riders were using the service to reach Wagner's Point, requiring a taxpayer subsidy of nearly $20 each.Taxpayer subsidies for MTA routes - baltimoresun.com Also in 2005, as part of GBBI, it was proposed that Route 64 would be combined with a portion of Route 27, and extended north to Mt. Washington through Hampden. In addition, Riviera Beach trips would have been shortened to Energy Parkway. These changes were not implemented, and in 2007, GBBI was canceled. In 2008, it was proposed that Riviera Beach trips would be shortened to Energy Parkway. But this change was never implemented, and the line continues to serve Riviera Beach nine times daily.

Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) was created by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to improve infrastructure design and construction practices to prevent or minimize damage during an earthquake or tsunami. Its headquarters were at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana as part of cooperative agreement #CMMI-0927178, and it ran from 2009 till 2014. The mission of NEES is to accelerate improvements in seismic design and performance by serving as a collaboratory for discovery and innovation. Description The NEES network features 14 geographically distributed, shared-use laboratories that support several types of experimental work: geotechnical centrifuge research, shake table tests, large- scale structural testing, tsunami wave basin experiments, and field site research. Participating universities include: Cornell University; Lehigh University;Oregon State University; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; University at Buffalo, SUNY; University of California, Berkeley; University of California, Davis; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California, San Diego; University of California, Santa Barbara; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; University of Minnesota; University of Nevada, Reno; and the University of Texas, Austin. Placing the wind turbine on the NEES@UCSD table.The equipment sites (labs) and a central data repository are connected to the global earthquake engineering community via the NEEShub, which is powered by the HUBzero software developed at Purdue University specifically to help the scientific community share resources and collaborate. The cyberinfrastructure, connected via Internet2, provides interactive simulation tools, a simulation tool development area, a curated central data repository, user-developed databases,Browning, J., Pujol, S., Eigenmann R., and Ramirez, J. (2013). NEEShub Databases-Quick access to concrete data, Concrete International, ACI, 35(4), pp. 55‚Äì60 animated presentations, user support, telepresence, mechanism for uploading and sharing resources and statistics about users, and usage patterns. This allows researchers to: securely store, organize and share data within a standardized framework in a central location, remotely observe and participate in experiments through the use of synchronized real-time data and video, collaborate with colleagues to facilitate the planning, performance, analysis, and publication of research experiments and conduct computational and hybrid simulations that may combine the results of multiple distributed experiments and link physical experiments with computer simulations to enable the investigation of overall system performance. The cyberinfrastructure supports analytical simulations using the OpenSees software. These resources jointly provide the means for collaboration and discovery to improve the seismic design and performance of civil and mechanical infrastructure systems.  Cyberinfrastructure  Cyberinfrastructure is an infrastructure based on computer networks and application-specific software, tools, and data repositories that support research in a particular discipline. The term \\"cyberinfrastructure\\" was coined by the National Science Foundation. Projects NEES Research covers a wide range of topics including performance of existing and new construction, energy dissipation and base isolation systems, innovative materials, lifeline systems such as pipelines, piping, and bridges, and nonstructural systems such a ceilings and cladding. Researchers are also investigation soil remediation technologies for liquefiable soils, and collecting information about tsunami impacts and building performance after recent earthquakes. The permanently instrumented field sites operated by NEES@UCSB support field observations of ground motions, ground deformations, pore pressure response, and soil- foundation-structure interaction.Steidl, J., Nigbor, R.L., and Youd, T.

Alloys are mixtures of a metal and other elements. They generally provide greater strength over pure metals, which are usually much softer and more ductile. Alloys of aluminium or magnesium are typically lighter for the same strength, provide better heat conduction, and often produce improved cosmetic appearance over steel wheels. Although steel, the most common material used in wheel production, is an alloy of iron and carbon, the term \\"alloy wheel\\" is usually reserved for wheels made from nonferrous alloys. The earliest light- alloy wheels were made of magnesium alloys. Although they lost favor on common vehicles, they remained popular through the 1960s, albeit in very limited numbers. In the mid-to-late 1960s, aluminium-casting refinements allowed the manufacture of safer wheels that were not as brittle. Until this time, most aluminium wheels suffered from low ductility, usually ranging from 2-3% elongation. Because light-alloy wheels at the time were often made of magnesium (often referred to as \\"mags\\"), these early wheel failures were later attributed to magnesium's low ductility, when in many instances these wheels were poorly cast aluminium alloy wheels. Once these aluminium casting improvements were more widely adopted, the aluminium wheel took the place of magnesium as low cost, high-performance wheels for motorsports. Characteristics Alcoa's heavy-duty alloy wheel, for buses and trucks. Lighter wheels can improve handling by reducing unsprung mass, allowing suspension to follow the terrain more closely and thus improve grip, however not all alloy wheels are lighter than their steel equivalents. Reduction in overall vehicle mass can also help to reduce fuel consumption. Better heat conduction and a more open wheel design can help dissipate heat from the brakes, which improves braking performance in more demanding driving conditions and reduces the chance of diminished brake performance or even failure due to overheating. An aluminium alloy wheel designed to recall the crossed spokes of a wire wheel Alloy wheels are also purchased for cosmetic purposes although the cheaper alloys used are usually not corrosion-resistant. Alloys allow the use of attractive bare-metal finishes, but these need to be sealed with paint or wheel covers. Even if so protected the wheels in use will eventually start to corrode after 3 to 5 years but refurbishment is now widely available at a cost. The manufacturing processes also allow intricate, bold designs. In contrast, steel wheels are usually pressed from sheet metal, and then welded together (often leaving unsightly bumps) and must be painted to avoid corrosion and/or hidden with wheel covers/hub caps. Alloy wheels are prone to galvanic corrosion, which can cause the tires to leak air if appropriate preventive measures are not taken. Also, alloy wheels are more difficult to repair than steel wheels when bent, but their higher price usually makes repairs cheaper than replacement. Chrysler alloy wheel Alloy wheels are more expensive to produce than standard steel wheels, and thus are often not included as standard equipment, instead being marketed as optional add-ons or as part of a more expensive trim package. However, alloy wheels have become considerably more common since 2000, now being offered on economy and subcompact cars, compared to a decade earlier where alloy wheels were often not factory options on inexpensive vehicles. Alloy wheels have long been included as standard equipment on higher-priced luxury or sports cars, with larger-sized or \\"exclusive\\" alloy wheels being options. The high cost of alloy wheels makes them attractive to thieves; to counter this, automakers and dealers often use locking lug nuts or bolts which require a special key to remove. Most alloy wheels are manufactured using casting, but some are forged. Forged wheels are usually lighter, stronger, but much more expensive than cast wheels. There are two types of forged wheels: one piece and modular. Modular forged wheels may feature two- or three-piece design. Typical multi-piece wheels consist of the inner rim base, outer rim lip and wheel center piece with openings for lug nuts. All parts of a modular wheel are held with bolts. BBS RS is one of the most famous three-piece modular forged wheels. Aftermarket wheels A sizable selection of alloy wheels are available to automobile owners who want lighter, more visually appealing, rarer, and/or larger wheels on their cars, going from a standard 14 and 15 inch wheels to 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26 and 28 inch wheel sizes. With the larger alloy wheels came alloy Tru-Spinners that were integral to the alloy wheel that would free-spin and continue to free-spin after the alloy wheel itself came to rest. Some Tru-Spinner alloy wheels would also spin backwards as the alloy wheel was rolling forward. Although replacing standard steel wheel and tire combinations with lighter alloy wheels and potentially lower profile tires can result in increased performance and handling, this doesn't necessarily hold when increasingly large wheels are employed. Research by Car and Driver conducted using a selection of differently sized alloy wheels from all outfitted with the same make and model of tires showed that both acceleration and fuel economy suffered with larger wheels. They also noted that ride comfort and noise were negatively affected by the larger wheels. Magnesium alloy wheels Magnesium alloy wheel on a Porsche Carrera GT alt= Magnesium alloy wheels were the first die-cast wheels produced, and were often referred to as simply \\"mag wheels.\\" Magnesium wheels were originally used for racing, but their popularity during the 1960s led to the development of other die-cast wheels, particularly of aluminium alloys. The term \\"mag wheels\\" became synonymous with die-cast wheels made from any material, from modern aluminium alloy wheels to plastic and composite wheels used on items like bicycles, wheelchairs, and skateboards.The ultimate hot rod dictionary: a-bombs to zoomies By Jeff Breitenstein, Troy Paiva - MBI Publishing 2004 Page 130The biomedical engineering handbook By Joseph D. Bronzino - CRC Press 2000 Page 141-4 However, pure magnesium wheels are no longer produced, being found only on classic cars. Pure magnesium suffers from many problems. Vintage magnesium rims were very susceptible to pitting, cracking and corrosion. Magnesium in bulk is hard to ignite but pure magnesium wheels can be ignited by a burning tire or by prolonged scraping of the wheel on the road surface following a puncture. Alloys of magnesium were later developed to alleviate most of these problems.Automotive Detailing: A Complete Car Care Guide for Auto Enthusiasts and Detailing Professionals By Don Taylor - HP Books 1998 Page 72 In fact, US Federal Aviation Administration has conducted wide-ranging tests over the past decade, and has reached a conclusion that potential flammability of magnesium is no longer deemed to be a concern. Modern surface treatment technologies provide protection from corrosion and significantly extend the average lifecycle of magnesium rims. Production methods=Forging= Forging can be done by a one or multi-step process forging from various magnesium alloys, most commonly AZ80, ZK60 (MA14 in Russia). Wheels produced by this method are usually of higher toughness and ductility than aluminium wheels, although the costs are much higher.https://f1wheels.com Forging is a complicated process that involves such processes, as heating, rolling, applying high pressure, hammering and/or combination of these. As a result, the molecular structure of the alloy changes, and as a result the material becomes stronger and more lightweight. =Assembly= There are one- two- and three-piece forged wheels. Every piece is originally an alloy billet, which is further transformed into a wheel, in cases of one-piece forged wheels, or into a wheel part in cases of multi-piece wheels. =High pressure die casting = This process uses a die arranged in a large machine that has high closing force to clamp the die closed. The molten magnesium is poured into a filler tube called a shot sleeve. A piston pushes the metal into the die with high speed and pressure, the magnesium solidifies and the die is opened and the wheel is released. Wheels produced by this method can offer reductions in price and improvements in corrosion resistance but they are less ductile and of lower strength due to the nature of high pressure die casting. =Low pressure die casting= This process usually employs a steel die, it is arranged above the crucible filled with molten magnesium. Most commonly the crucible is sealed against the die and pressurized air/cover gas mix is used to force the molten metal up a straw-like filler tube into the die. Bootie Folding Cycle When processed using best practice methods, low pressure die casting wheels can offer improvements in ductility over magnesium wheels and any cast aluminium wheels, they remain less ductile than forged magnesium. =Gravity casting = Gravity-cast magnesium wheels have been in production since the early 1920s and provide good ductility, and relative properties above what can be made with aluminium casting. Tooling costs for gravity-cast wheels are among the cheapest of any process. This has allowed small batch production, flexibility in design and short development time.

His father used to help him train, but now after returning from a battle with a wound in his leg, the father is fearful and does not want Jonathan to leave. However, when the war bell rings on 3 April 1778, Jonathan leaves anyway. He borrows a tavern owner's gun and joins a morning-long march to battle the German Hessians, who are allied with the British. Jonathan ends up being taken prisoner. Three Hessians take him to an old house where they bury a murdered couple, and Jonathan finds a small boy, a son of the buried couple, in the barn. He develops some degree of Stockholm Syndrome, before escaping in the night back to the American army camp. The Corporal, who turns out to be the one who murdered the boy's parents, knows where the house is.

He has been the eleventh Archbishop of Portland, Oregon, since 2013. He was previously the twelfth Bishop of Marquette, Michigan. Early life and education Alexander King Sample was born in Kalispell, Montana, to Alexander and Joyce (n√©e Dory) Sample (d. 2017), his father was of Scottish heritage and his mother Polish. He graduated from Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1978. He attended Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan, where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1982 and a Master of Science degree in metallurgical engineering in 1984. Interested in becoming a priest since the fourth grade, he decided to study for the priesthood after graduating from MTU, saying, \\"I knew I would never know peace until I explored the vocation to be a priest.\\" He graduated in 1986 from the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, and then entered the Pontifical College Josephinum in Columbus, Ohio. Priesthood Sample was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Marquette by Bishop Mark Schmitt on June 1, 1990. He was parochial vicar at the parish of St. Peter Cathedral from 1990 to 1993, and then served as pastor of St. George Parish in Bark River, St. Michael Parish in Perronville, and Sacred Heart Parish in Schaffer (all of which were consolidated into St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Parish in 1995). In 1994, he was sent to further his studies in Rome at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum), later earning a licentiate in canon law in 1996. Upon his return to the Diocese of Marquette in 1996, Sample was named chancellor and pastor of St. Christopher Parish. He also served as a member of the College of Consultors, director of Ministry Personnel Services and of Ongoing Formation of Priests, and diocesan chaplain to the Knights of Columbus. Within the Marriage Tribunal, he served as judge, adjutant judicial vicar, defender of the bond, and promoter of justice. He was also director of the Bishop Baraga Association and vice-postulator of the cause of beatification for Bishop Frederic Baraga. Episcopal ministry=Bishop of Marquette= On December 13, 2005, Sample was appointed the twelfth Bishop of Marquette by Pope Benedict XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 2006, from Cardinal Adam Maida, with bishops James Garland and Mark Schmitt serving as co-consecrators. At the time of his consecration, Sample was the youngest Catholic bishop in the United States and the first to be born in the 1960s. He selected as his episcopal motto: \\"Vultum Christi Contemplari\\", meaning \\"To Contemplate the Face of Christ\\". On October 7, 2007, at the invitation of Archbishop Raymond Leo Burke, Sample attended the Red Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, delivering the homily. In April 2009, Sample expressed his \\"disappointment and dismay\\" over the University of Notre Dame's decision to have President Barack Obama deliver its commencement speech and receive an honorary degree, given Obama's pro-abortion views. He added, \\"It saddens me beyond words that the great university named after Our Lady would bestow distinction and honor on a politician who would seek to expand threats to such innocent human life.\\" In July 2012, Sample ordained five seminarians to the diaconate, and ten new subdeacons. Among these new subdeacons are five from the United States for the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest. Sample has stressed that permanent deacons should not regularly preach at Mass; rather they should preach at other services and serve the Church in the course of their daily witness to Christ. His 19-page letter, titled \\"The Deacon: Icon of Jesus Christ the Servant\\", cited the principle that the one who presides at a liturgical service or who is the principal celebrant at Mass should also give the homily: \\"This should be the ordinary practice.\\" Deacons should preach the homily at Mass \\"for some identifiable advantage for the faithful in the congregation, but not on a regular basis.\\" The Diocese of Marquette serves roughly 70,000 Roman Catholics in the Upper Peninsula. =Archbishop of Portland= On January 29, 2013, Sample was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to be the new Archbishop of Portland in Oregon, to succeed the retiring archbishop John George Vlazny. He was installed on April 2, 2013 (Easter Tuesday), at the Chiles Center Arena on the campus of the University of Portland. In 2017, Sample issued a decree stating that sexually-active homosexuals as well as divorced and civilly-remarried persons should not receive the Holy Eucharist, and that they must \\"sacramentally confess all serious sins with a firm purpose to change\\" before they can do so.

It seeks to spread the true purpose of every religion which originated on Earth and preaches the oneness of all religions such as Saivism, Vaishnavism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, etc.., and united more than 69 castes into a single community. Its focus is on spiritual enlightenment and conquest of death by attaining Heaven, through the teachings and blessings of its founder and leader, Meivazhi Salai Andavargal (Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ¥‡Æø ‡Æö‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡ÆÜ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç meyva·∏ªi cƒÅlai ƒÅ·πá·π≠avarka·∏∑), who is believed to be the final incarnation of God expected by all religion. It has its own set of holy scriptures that runs up to four volumes, along with a unique prayer system and festivals. Although its founder was born in a Muslim family, it draws strongly from Hinduism. It allows membership irrespective of caste, creed, colour or religion, but the only requirement for being a disciple of Meivazhi religion is to be a believer in God. It has only one temple all across the world, which is situated at Meivazhi Salai in Pudukkottai district, Tamil Nadu, named as the Ponnaranga Devalayam (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Æ∞‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç, Po·πâ·πâara·πÖka tƒìvƒÅlayam). Its official liturgical language is Tamil. The religion forbids smoking, alcohol, gambling, and theft, and practices vegetarianism. The Temple stipulates a Dress-code for its followers, which are white panchakacham and a white pointed turban for its Male followers, while its female followers, wear a headscarf. The senior disciples who had received spiritual revelations (Tamil: ‡Æâ‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Øç Upatƒìcam) from Salai Aandavargal, wear saffron clothing and wear saffron pointed turban with an upward-pointing crescent symbol called as 'Kilnaamam' (Tamil: ‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ≥‡Øç‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡ÆÆ‡Øç Ki·∏∑nƒÅmƒÅm). Further, the senior disciples of the Religion prefix the word 'Meivazhi' before their name and suffix the word 'Anandar', while the younger disciples have the word 'Salai' prefixed to their names.

As such, the case was contested by the Temple before the Deputy Commissioner of HR&CE; Department in O.A. No. 69 of 1985, during which, depositions were obtained from several members of the community, who originally belonged to various religions such as Hinduism, Christianity, Islam. Notably, several leading lawyers were followers of this Religion. One Meivazhi Kailai Anandhar, a Hindu by birth and leading criminal lawyer of that time, was the president of the Association till 1974 One Meivazhi Gowshal Anandar, a Muslim by birth and another leading criminal lawyer, who was the chairman of the Wakf Board; Justice Suryamurty, a retired Judge of the Hon'ble High Court, were all part of this Religion. It was noted in the proceedings that the Ponnuranga Devalayam and Meivazhi sabha were not exclusively intended for the Hindus alone, but non-Hindus also. It was observed in the proceedings that all the followers of Meivazhi Andavar have been strictly adopting the principles and regulations and mode of living, religious rituals, ceremonies, conducting of marriages, conducting of obsequies after death, as enumerated in their four sacred books, and that it is quite different from the regulations and the rituals to be followed by the Hindus at the time of religious ceremonies, like marriages, etc., It was further observed that the institution Ponnuranga Devalayam does not have any Thuvajasthambam, praharam, gopuram and Vimaanam, etc., which are normal features for a Hindu Temple. Ultimately, the proceedings were concluded vide an Order dated 03.04.1986, holding that the Ponnuranga Devalayam and the Meivazhi sabha do not come under the purview of the HR&CE; Act, (Act 22 of 1959, Tamil Nadu). This was also confirmed by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras in Writ Petition (Madurai) No. 13175 of 2012.  History = Biography of Salai Aandavargal = The followers of this religion address the founder as \\"Meivazhi Salai Aandavargal (Tamil: ‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æµ‡Æ¥‡Æø ‡Æö‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡Øà ‡ÆÜ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç meyva·∏ªi CƒÅlai ƒÅ·πá·π≠avarka·∏∑)\\". One of the earliest accounts of a meeting with Salai Andavargal in his erstwhile Tiruppattur Ashram, has been narrated in a Book titled 'Glimpses of Chettimarnad' published in 1937 by R.J. Ram & Company, Triplicane High Road, Madras, authored by an Explorer and Newspaperman named Nilkan Perumal, who had mistakenly entered the Pudukkottai State during his tour of the Chettinad region. Further details regarding the early life history and experiences of Salai Aandavargal are provided by the holy scripture \\"Aadhi Maanmiyam (Tamil: ‡ÆÜ‡Æ§‡Æø ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç)\\", which was written by Salai Andavargal himself, narrating his early life and experiences. =Early Life= According to the volume, Maanmiyam, Salai Aandavargal was born in 1857 at Markhampetti, a village in Oddanchatram Taluk, Dindigul district, Tamil Nadu. He was named Khader Badsha Rowther by his parents - his father being Jamal Hussain Rowther and mother Periya Thayi. He had his primary education from a teacher who conducted a school under a banyan tree in the said village. He had learnt to recite Quoran at first, but soon came his quest of finding the truth about life and the state of the soul after death. He went after prophets and preachers to learn the correct path to salvation. He had asked orange-robed sanyasins, the black robed bearded fakirs and the Gospel- preaching Christian missionaries to show him the correct way for God realization. However, he soon realized that many people were pretending to be saints for the sake of earning money. He conversed regarding hatha yoga as the only way to attain spiritual enlightenment, and subsequently, lost hope in spirituality. After his marriage to Suleka Bivi, at the age of 18, with the blessings of his parents, he migrated to Kasukkaranpalayam, a village in Perundurai taluk, Erode in Tamil Nadu and established himself as a wholesale paddy merchant. He had a daughter named Aisuamma. =Meeting with Satguru= At the age of 26, when Salai Andavargal had almost given up on spirituality, he met an elderly person by coincidence, whom Salai Andavargal invited to his Paddy shop and offerred Ragi Dosa with Honey. When Salai Andavargal proudly conversed with this elderly person regarding Hatha yoga and other spiritual ways to attain heaven, unlike the other gurus who merely praised Salai Andavargal and agreed to everything, this elderly person had sharply remarked that all of his ideas are very good shortcuts to hell. Shocked by such a response, Salai Andavargal sensed that the elderly person had something divine. Therefter, Salai Andavargal became a Disciple of the said elderly person, who was later revealed to be Shri Thanigai Mani Piran (Also known as Mohamed Saligh and as Paattaiyar). It is stated that Shri Thanigai Mani Piran was more than 600 years old and that he was also the satguru of Ramalinga Swamigal. Shri Thanigai Mani Piran, eventually baptized Salai Aandavargal through Brahmopadhesam (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ∞‡Æπ‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Øã‡Æ™‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Øç Prahm≈çpƒÅtƒìcam), the spiritual revelations, at Kasukkaranpalayam, Erode, revealing to Salai Aandavargal his true form and his purpose on Earth, elaborating that it was their destiny to meet. It is stated that the meeting of Salai Andavargal his satguru was already prophecised by many saints and the volume Maanmiyam at Chapter 9B, Page 249, extracts certain verses written by Ayya Vaikundar, detailing the meeting between Salai Andavargal and his Satguru, their bonds, parting of ways and the subsequent events. Thereafter, Salai Aandavargal lost interest in materialistic possessions and renounced his profession, wife, child and everything to attain the highest spiritual enlightenment, following his satguru all around South India. The first meeting of Salai Andavargal and his satguru is celebrated by the followers as a festival during pournami day of the Panguni month (April), as the \\"(Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æµ‡Ææ ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Øç ‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æ±‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Øç Pi·πüavƒÅ nƒÅ·∏∑ pi·πüappu tirunƒÅ·∏∑)\\" festival. =Shepherdhood= After 12 years with his satguru, when Salai Aandavargal had finally attained the highest level of spiritual enlightenment, his Satguru decided to slowly part ways to prepare Salai Andavargal for his real purpose on Earth. Even though they had attained spiritual enlightenment, the human avatar had emotional bonds with Satguru and therefore, Salai Andavargal was ordered to tend to a flock of sheep at Reddiapatti village in Virudhunagar district for a year, during which Shri Thanigai Mani Piran slowly started visiting Salai Andavargal lesser and lesser often until Salai Andavargal was accustomed to this. This event of tending to Sheep is remembered and celebrated annually by the disciples, as the \\"(Tamil: ‡ÆÜ‡Æü‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Øá‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ≤‡Æï‡Øç ‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æü‡Øç‡Æö‡Æø ƒÄ·π≠u mƒìyppu tirukk≈çlak kƒÅ·π≠ci)\\" festival during the month of Vaisakha (Vaikasi in Tamil). =Tapas/Penance= After Salai Andavargal had tended to Sheep for a year, his satguru directed Salai Andavargal to observe severe Tapas or penance in a cave on the western side of Thiruparankundram hill (near Madurai) which he carried out for another 12 years, under the wakefulness and near-starvation diet of Prickly pear. Thereby he acquired divine symbols (sannadams) in his sacred hand ‚Äì such us Udukai, Trishula, Shankhu, Sudarshana Chakra, Villu, Vaal, Gada (mace), Angusam, Paasam, Modhagam, Vel and finally the ‚ÄúKilnamam\\" (Crescent moon), which are stated to be visible in his palms. The Crescent moon is the ultimate divine symbol, which is now used by his followers as their religion's righteous symbol. It is stated in Maanmiyam, that Shri Thanigai Mani Piran had requested Salai Andavargal not to fall at his feet thereafter, reasoning that Salai Andavargal had acquired the 'Kilnaamam (Crescent Moon) symbol in his hand, which no other Incarnate/sage in the Four Yugas had obtained. Salai Aandavargal acquiring the holy symbol is commemorated by celebrating the festival of ‚Äú(Tamil: ‡Æï‡Øã‡Æü‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡ØÅ‡Æ§ ‡Æö‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Æ§‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡Æï‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ®‡Æ§‡Øç ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ≥‡Øç Kodaayudha Sannathath Thirukkappu Kangganath Thirunall) in the month of Vaikasi (June). =The Beginning of Meivazhi= When Shri Thanigai Mani Piran understood that his disciple Salai Andavargal was fully endowed with wit and power, he christened Salai Andavargal as ‚ÄúMaarganadhar‚Äù and directed Salai Andavargal to return to the world to undertake the divine mission of redeeming the seekers of truth from the bondage of ignorance and illusion and persuaded Salai Andavargal to proceed forward alone in his holy mission. Initially, cladding himself in a saffron robe, Salai Andavargal, preached to sanyasis and saints, but thereupon he understood that most of the sanyasis were impostors not because of their ignorance, but deliberation to loot innocent people's money for satisfying their lust and hunger. Finally, Andavargal gave up the garb of sanyasi and took to preaching family people engaged in worldly occupations. =The Rajagambeeram Ashram= The First Meivazhi sabha was started at Rajagambeeram village in Sivaganga district, Tamil Nadu in 1901. However, it is stated that the Hindu priests, Moslem Imams and Christian Padres heard about his doctrine with dismay and persecuted Salai Andavargal, forcing him to flee Rajagambiram. The Meivazhi sabha was again started in Tiruppattur, a panchayat town in Sivaganga district, Tamil Nadu. Later, at Tiruppattur he married Panimathi Nachiyar as per his Satguru's wish. Thereafter, Salai Andavargal and Shri Thanigai Mani Piran permanently parted ways. Even at Tiruppattur, it is stated that the persecution had gone on for a time, but had soon ended. At this time, men began coming in large numbers to hear his teachings, and from small beginnings, the number of followers gradually increased, year by year. The Meivazhi Sabha was formally registered as an Association on 19.06.1933. Objects of Meivazhi # bringing home to man the Lost truth that the very purpose of religion is to rescue him from the death- throes, eradicating the falsehoods and half-truths about religions among many other spiritual values. # baptizing with the spirit, thereby enlightening and expanding the dark and constricted heart and opening the vistas of soul, a series of eternal revelations; # Warning mankind against the impending disaster and destruction, the whole universe is facing. # Offering mankind a helping hand to escape the 'sting of death' and to win the 'victory of the grave', and resurrecting the dead even many days after their final departure from the mortal coil to reach their rendezvous (heavenly destination), which is the Abode of Bliss. Beliefs of Meivazhi=Origin of Man= The contents of the 4 Volumes of Meivazhi religions' Sacred Texts emphasizes on the prime duty of every man to \\"Know himself\\". In the Volume, \\"Kodayudha Koor\\", it has been stated that Tamil is the oldest language on Earth. In the Tamil Language, the word \\"‡ÆÆ‡Æ©‡ØÅ‡Æ∑‡Æ©‡Øç/Ma·πâu·π£a·πâ\\", means Man. If the said Tamil word is split into two, it becomes \\"‡ÆÆ‡Æ©‡ØÅ/Ma·πâu (Earthly)\\" + either \\"‡Æà‡Æö‡Æ©‡Øç/ƒ™ca·πâ (God)\\" or \\"‡Æ®‡ØÄ‡Æö‡Æ©‡Øç/Nƒ´ca·πâ (Vile or Bad)\\", which indicates what a Man is truly capable of transforming into. The Man was created as a God. The prime purpose of the Meivazhi religion is to make Mankind, aware of their true astral identity and also to reveal the true purpose of every religion which came upon Earth. As explained by the Sacred texts of every major religion, the Meivazhi religion explains that Man is an Astral being originally created by a Superior God in Heaven in a highly powerful and sophisticated form. However, he was deceived and tempted by Satan (who was a God himself, created by the Superior God), into consuming a Forbidden fruit made by Satan, which the Superior God had warned never to consume. When Man relented to Satan's temptation that consumption of the forbidden fruit would make him much more powerful than the creator himself, Man had lost all his highly sophisticated powers and was eternally trapped in a Lowly, despicable, earthly form, with traces of Satan inside. Consequently, Man (in his lowly form) and Satan were both banished from Heaven and imprisoned on Earth for their sins. However, on seeing and hearing Man's cries, the Superior God pitied Man and reduced his punishment from an eternity, to a lifetime of repentance on Earth for his sin of consuming the forbidden fruit and also promised to stay within the Man's lowly form for a lifetime to let him find a way to attain his true heavenly form. The Volume \\"Maanmiyam\\", explains that in order to make Earth more livable for Man, the Superior God had gone a step further to create 1008 earthly features such as mountains, waterfalls, seas, along with thousands of animals and birds and many other wonders on earth, entirely for Man, even though Man had not dared to ask for any of it since such a debt cannot be repaid by Man, even if an equivalent of Heaven is given back to the Superior God. Such magnanimity of the Superior God and of the Man's Debt is stated to be explained in Tirukku·πõa·∏∑ 101, which reads as follows: - ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æ§ ‡Æâ‡Æ§‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æµ‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÜ‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æ≤‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æ§‡ØÅ Tamil to English Translation: ((The gift of) heaven and earth is not an equivalent for a benefit which is conferred where none had been received.) =Purpose of Man on Earth= Consequently, Man started his life on Earth, with both the Superior God (Good) and the Satan (Evil) within himself. The Volume, Kodayudha Koor, reveals that the Heavenly form of Man is locked inside himself with 16 divine locks across 16 directions, safe from Satan and Man himself. For a Man's soul to gain control of his true Heavenly form, Man has to earn the sympathy of the Superior God within himself, within his lifetime. It is stated that it is impossible to attain that heavenly form without the help of the Superior God himself or the guidance of another Man who had already attained the heavenly form. Man is absolutely capable of transforming back into his true Heavenly form. However, when a Man forgets the Superior God within him and fails to earn the sympathy of the Superior God, the Superior God merely leaves Man, and Satan (still a God) would eternally enslave the Man's soul, turning Man into a ‡Æ®‡ØÄ‡Æö‡Æ©‡Øç/Nƒ´ca·πâ (Vile or Bad). During the initial days on Earth, known as the Satya Yuga, Mankind was well aware of their astral descent and Mankind was very successful in conquering Satan and returning back to Heaven. However, during the Treta Yuga, a portion of Mankind was corrupted by Satan provoking them to commit evil deeds. Earth was slowly taken over by the Satan, who had been corrupting mankind in whatever ways possible to prevent mankind from attaining their true heavenly form. As the Treta Yuga and the Dvapara Yuga passed, Satan's influence had grown exponentially leading to widespread chaos and destruction. The Kali Yuga saw a majority of mankind corrupted by Satan, who provoked mankind to lust after materialistic possessions and worldly ideas. It is stated in Volume \\"Kodayuda Koor\\" that the Kali Yuga had begun when the Mahabharata War took place between Mankind, which was the first-ever War between Mankind, where Mankind fought amongst themselves over materialistic earthly possessions due to the corruption caused by Satan. It is stated that the Kali Yuga was the beginning of a period where a majority of mankind had forgotten even the Superior God within himself, with no clue of their true heavenly identity. Man had forgotten his true purpose in life, falling as prey to Satan's deceptions and illusions. According to the Meivazhi religion, the biggest Sin a Man could commit on Earth is \\"forgetting the presence of the Superior God within Man's lowly earth form\\", and all the Debts owed by Mankind to the Superior God. The Meivazhi religion teaches that throughout the Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga and the Dvapara Yuga, nearly 33 Crores Men had conquered Satan and attained their true heavenly form and returned back to Heaven. Further, that throughout the Yugas, nearly 1,24,000 Men, known as the Nabis or Prophets, had returned back or stayed back on Earth to assist mankind to attain their true heavenly form. However, it is stated that many of the Nabis who came down to Earth during the Dvapara Yuga were ridiculed by the ignorant Mankind and far worse, in the initial days of the Kali Yuga, many such Nabis were even tortured by such ungrateful Mankind, under the influence of Satan. As such, a majority of Mankind had fallen as prey to Satan, with absolutely no clue about their identity or their purpose in life. The Meivazhi Religion teaches that apart from the 1,24,000 Nabis came to Earth during different times to awaken the Mankind from their ignorance, the Superior God himself had come down to Earth in 9 different earthly forms, across different regions on Earth, throughout the Yugas. It is revealed that every religion on Earth, is merely a shadow of the same Superior God, teaching the same core principles, with the sole intent of making mankind realize its astral origin and its true capabilities. But despite the Superior God's efforts, Mankind would no longer believe in the concept of God. The Nabis were disrespected and tortured by the Mankind under the influence of Satan, which had actively worked against the teachings of the Superior God and the Nabis, manipulating mankind to believe in multiple religious beliefs, multiple gods and even false Gods. Satan had managed to manipulate and fragment Mankind into different groups and had actively pitted the followers of one fragment against each other, destroying the very purpose of all those Religions. As such, every such religion lost its true purpose and became powerless. Religion became a mere mockery serving no purpose and this led to further chaos, and a major portion of Mankind had no means to attain their true heavenly form. A large portion of Mankind was following religions only in name, without even knowing its true purpose nor the fact that the Superior God exists within himself, and became totally unaware of their astral origin, completely blinded by their lust for materialistic possessions. =Kalki Yuga= It is stated in the Volume \\"Kodayutha Koor\\" that the Meivazhi Religion marks the end of the Kali Yuga and the beginning of the Kalki Yuga, which was prophesied in the Kalki Purana and anticipated by the sacred texts of many religions. The Meivazhi religion had successfully united 69 Castes and every major religion on Earth such a Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, etc., into a single community. The Meivazhi religion preaches the oneness of all religion and with the sole intent of revealing the true purpose of every religion which exists on Earth, and to make mankind realize their true astral origins and their destiny to reach Heaven. Meivazhi religion teaches its followers that both the Superior God and the Satan within themselves, and it is up to Mankind to choose whichever path they please. Its founder had instructed the disciples not to worship statues or photos of him, which are merely temporary identities of the Superior god and not the Superior god himself. The Meivazhi religion teaches that the Superior God exists inside the Man's heart and that a Man's affection alone could earn the sympathy of the Superior God. Thus the proverb in Tamil, \\"‡ÆÖ‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øá ‡Æö‡Æø‡Æµ‡ÆÆ‡Øç/A·πâpƒì civam\\" meaning, Love is God. The Meivazhi Religion teaches its followers that the Superior God exists within Man only to protect his Soul from Satan and that praying for materialistic possessions from the Superior God is like asking an Emperor for a broom. The followers of the Meivazhi religion believe that the person who founded the Meivazhi religion is the Kalki avatar, the final incarnation of Lord Vishnu as mentioned in Hinduism and also the Second Coming of God's incarnation on this Earth as mentioned in various other religions., expected to bring an end to the Kali (demon). =The End of the World Prophecy= The Volume Kodayudha Koor states that the destruction of the Earth will take place in Hijri year 1500, which is 21-Jul-2077 in Gregorian Calendar. Further, in the volume Maanmiyam, in chapter 9B - \\"Sannadham Perum Paruvam\\", Page 254, a poem written by Ayya Vaikundar, has been extracted, wherein at Stanzas 2 and 3, certain hints have been made in Tamil as follows:- \\"...‡Æµ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ≥ ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡Æ£‡Øç‡ÆÆ‡Æ©‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øç / Vangala Palace (or Royals) ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ±‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Øá ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ¥‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æö‡Øç / are coming to destroy Kali ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™ ‡Æé‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Æµ‡Øá / It is not very easy ‡Æö‡ØÜ‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æè‡Æ≤‡Ææ ‡Æ§‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç... / no one can win\\" Although the exact meaning of the word \\"Vangala\\" is unclear, it could possibly indicate the rise of Bengal or China. =Religious attributes of a true Spiritual Guru= Meivazhi teaches that the Heavenly tokens which distinguish a true spiritual guru from impostors are that: *he has conquered slumber and sleep. *he has conquered the necessity to breathe. *he has practically overcome the need for food. It is believed by the followers of Meivazhi that Salai Andavargal had exhibited all the above-stated features.  Claims of incorruptibility  It is believed that the primordial sign that a man has reached the Superior God is that the person's physical self will become incorruptible when he dies. Although this may sound very strange for a majority of people, it is believed that a shocking majority of people on Earth since the Kali yuga, have been following religion only in name without knowing its purpose and without even knowing the whereabouts of the Supreme God. A vast majority pray to Gods in the skies, oceans and Stones, without realizing that the Supreme God actually exists within oneself. It is believed that, When a man dies without even meeting the Supreme God within himself, he dies without even fulfilling his most basic purpose in life, and therefore, the Supreme God merely leaves his earthly form without helping the Soul to attain its true heavenly form. Consequently, the earthly form decays and the Soul becomes eternally enslaved by Satan. However, when a Man had realized the Supreme God within himself and prayed affectionately throughout his lifetime, he is helped by the Supreme God attain his true heavenly form locked within himself, at the time of his death and Satan would fear to get anywhere close to a Man's heavenly form. Therefore, the earthly form would never decompose. It is believed that every religion came to earth only to prove this as a fact and it can be seen in many saints, whose bodies have not decomposed through hundreds of years. This phenomenon is stated to happen among the people of the Meivazhi religion and there were instances, where even non-followers, who had visited the Meivazhi Salai temple and prayed, had shown signs of incorruptibility. The Followers of Meivazhi believe that a person's attainment of Heaven can be ascertained by their body, by observing the following 10 signs after death showing Immortal Proofs of Salvation at the time of death: * No bad stench of the body. only pleasant aroma of the body. No discharge of foul-smelling liquid. * No stiffening of the body.

On a full moon day, Andavargal hoisted a flag (Pooran Kodi) with 96 bells. Several disciples came and attended the historic event. Andavargal composed a song called Gnana Sangu In one of the Meivazhi Vedas, namely \\"Aadhi Maanmiyam\\", at Chapter 2, page 7, it is stated that the Village Rajagambeeram was previously known as Shambhala during the times of Narada. However, due to religious persecution at Rajagambeeram Village, the said Ashram was abandoned. Subsequently, the Meivazhi Asharam was started at Tiruppattur, a panchayat town in the present Sivaganga district, Tamil Nadu, where the Sabha was initially registered as a Society on 19 June 1933 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (Act 21 of 1860, India). From small beginnings, the number of followers gradually increased year by year. On 14.09.1940, Madurai Ashram was inaugurated and the sabha was shifted to Madurai (Aruppukottai Road) The new Ashram was painstakingly built entirely using Granite stones. But in 1942, during the Second World War, the British Government acquired the entire place in Madurai and paid a compensation of Rs.1,37,750/- to the Meivazhi Sabha. Consequently, the sabha had to be shifted again to a different place and the Madurai Ashram came to be referred as the ‡Æ™‡Æ¥‡Æû‡Øç‡Æö‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡Øà/Pa·∏ªa√±cƒÅlai (meaning old Salai). It is stated that even prior to the acquisition, some prophetic carvings were inscribed in the lentil stones of the Ashram hall in the year 1940, which reads as \\"‡ÆÜ‡Æ≤‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ± ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡Æö‡ØÅ ‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øç\\" (\\"When the Temple changes, the Government will change\\"). The said inscription in the erstwhile Meivazhi Ashram (presently the Madurai Aerodrome campus) remains a monument for the Disciples. The Meivazhi sabha was later shifted to Pappancahivayal, Pudukkottai district, Tamil Nadu, near the Ural Hills, in the erstwhile Pudukkottai State, where Salai Aandavargal purchased a jungle land for about Rs.6,000/- and cleared it for habitation. On 17.11.1942, Andavargal hoisted the first flag and named the place as Meivazhi Salai The Sabha was re-registered on 10 June 1944 and it became the Meivazhi Salai village. The Meivazhi Sabha had a President and 24 senior disciples referred to as the \\"‡Æö‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡ÆØ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æø‡Æü‡Æø ‡ÆÆ‡ØÇ‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡Æ∞‡Øç/Cattiyappi·π≠i m≈´ppar\\" (Elders of Truth), appointed by Salai Andavargal himself, to take care of the everyday affairs of the Sabha. One Meivazhi Kailai Anandhar, a leading criminal lawyer of that time, was the president of the Association till 1974 and thereafter due to his old age, Salai Andavargal appointed one Meivazhi Murugamalai Anandar as the President. It is stated that during the British- ruled period, the senior disciples had suggested to Salai Andavargal that the compensation amount given by the British and the offerings given by the Disciples, could be converted in the form of Gold and thus several Gold ingots engraved with the seal of the British Crown were purchased and stored at various hidden locations across the village under different trees. The location of the ingots were known to a very few disciples, many of whom had passed away due to old age. However, immediately after Salai Andavargal attained MahasamƒÅdhi on 19.02.1976, confusion and chaos prevailed among the followers, as to the future of the temple administration and also the uncertainty as to whether the phenomenon of Incorruptibility will continue or not. In March 1976, the followers had faced a credibility crisis, when the Customs and Excise Department officers, on the basis of some anonymous tip-off from within the village, raided the hermitage in a weeklong operation, unearthing all the stored gold and silver ornaments including personal belongings of some of the disciples. The Government had charged many of the disciples for illegal hoarding of wealth, but eventually lost the case since the recovered ornaments were not personal belongings of the Disciples, but belongings of the Sabha. After years of uncertainty and fear, the disciples finally came back to the temple when they realized that the phenomenon of Incorruptibility was continuing to take place even when Salai Andavargal was in a state of MahasamƒÅdhi. The place where Salai Andavargal attained MahasamƒÅdhi, is referred to as the \\"Ponnaranga Devalayam (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Øä‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ©‡Æ∞‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æ≤‡ÆØ‡ÆÆ‡Øç, Po·πâ·πâara·πÖka tƒìvƒÅlayam), meaning \\"The Golden Temple\\". All the Prayers, Rituals and Festivals are held around this Shrine. = Dress code for entering the Ashram = Meivazhi followers have a mandatory dress code for entering the ashram. It stipulates white panchakacham and a white pointed turban for its Male followers , while its female followers, wear a headscarf or cover their head with their Saree. The Senior followers (known as Anandars), who had obtained spiritual revelations (Tamil: ‡Æâ‡Æ™‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æö‡ÆÆ‡Øç Upatƒìcam) from Salai Aandavargal, wear saffron clothing and wear saffron pointed turban with an upward-pointing crescent symbol called as 'Kilnaamam' (Tamil: ‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ≥‡Øç‡Æ®‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡ÆÆ‡Øç Ki·∏∑nƒÅmƒÅm). Since 2007, the Government of Tamil Nadu had even provided a relaxation for the followers from wearing bike helmets when the Turban is worn, since many followers wear the Turban throughout the day. = Practices and rituals= The followers of Meivazhi do not worship any idols, tombs or any materialistic subjects, but they pray to the superior god within themselves. The rituals and festivals, which take place near the temple are merely a reminder that the superior god is within themselves. Daily rituals take place around-the-clock at the Ponnaranga Devalayam, throughout the year. The most significant prayer ritual for the followers is the evening one, which is attended by most people on any given day. The followers refer to the prayer rituals as 'Vanakkam (Tamil: ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç Va·πáakkam)', literally meaning 'Hello' or 'Greeting' in English, possibly referring to the meeting of Human soul with the God. 1\\\\.

Founded in 1946 by Bill Bowser in Redlands, California, he used his skill as a machinist to design and produce one of the first lines of accurately scaled steam locomotive kits in HO scale. In 1955, his financial partner Donald Acheson forced Bowser out of the company by enforcing a buyout clause in their agreement. After Acheson sold the considerable backstock of kits and parts, he sold the company to Lewis English in 1961. The company has since grown and continues to produce its own line of injection molded plastic model kits and ready-to-run locomotives. California Years (1946-1961) Bill Sheldon Bowser was born in Hancock, Ohio, in 1914. In 1944 he was a machinist working for the Naval Ordinance Plant in Indianapolis, Indiana. Bowser's friend George Hockaday asked if he was able to produce some hobby parts for him in HO scale, since they were in short supply due to wartime rationing. Sparking his interest, he acquired the inventory of spare parts from a company called Knapp that was producing a popular steam locomotive kit. Bowser paid off a debt owed by Knapp to Superior Casting, and the inventory of parts was released. Upon further inspection, Bowser discovered that many of the key parts were not made to scale and suffered from manufacturing defects. In 1946 Bowser relocated his family to California to launch his model railroad manufacturing business. Bowser acquired additional machinery, as well as the molds to produce the Knapp steam locomotive, before he relocated from Indiana to California. Unable to find a suitable facility, Bowser purchased land and began constructing a small factory in Redlands. His redesigned steam locomotive kit was still in production, so Bowser accepted manufacturing contracts to produce everything from rocket nozzles to parts for toy guns. In the meantime, considerable time and money were spent on developing finely detailed brass castings for his model steam locomotive kit. After the contractor hired to produce the castings quit, Bowser discovered the wrong type of plaster has been used to make the masters, which created poor quality parts. While Bowser had solved the production issue, he did not have enough funds to begin manufacturing his steam locomotive kit. Donald Acheson became Bowser's silent partner providing enough working capital to put the model kit into production. The first ads for Bowser's 4-8-2 Mountain HO scale steam locomotive kit appeared in Model Railroader in 1948. Though the kit was now available for purchase, design flaws were discovered in the electric motor used to power the model. Bowser redesigned the motor from scratch, calling this new design the \\"Supermotor.\\" The decision to sell through distributors instead of direct sales to consumers further hurt Bowser's financial position. Nonetheless, a new 4-6-2 Pacific based on New York Central Railroad class K-11 locomotives was put into production. Learning from the Mountain project, many parts were cast from zamac instead of brass, lowering cost and since parts could be produced in automated die-casting machines. The new K-11 Pacific locomotive kit was brought to market in 1951, and introduced many improvements over the previous offering. Despite sales being hurt by postwar inflation and a general economic downturn, Bowser went ahead with design and production of his most ambitious project to date. Working from actual Union Pacific Railroad blueprints with the aid of an early mechanical calculator, Bowser recreated the 4-6-6-4 Challenger in HO scale. The end result was an accurate model that set Bowser apart from other manufacturers of the day. Unfortunately, the manufacturing issues encountered over the last few years had depleted the company's finances and Bowser was forced to accept additional contract work to pay for production of the Challenger. After the contract ended and the Challenger was in production, Acheson chose to force out Bill Bowser's portion of the partnership. Bowser's personal finances were nearly depleted, and he was unable to match Acheson's buyout offer, forcing him to leave the company in 1955. Since the factory was in full production at the time of Bill Bowser's ouster, Acheson was able to stockpile a considerable number of kits to sell over the next few years. Bill Bowser established Bowser Precision Products in 1955, and earned lucrative contracts that he fulfilled initially by leasing back his old factory from Acheson. After a successful engineering career spanning many years he retired to Arizona. He was inducted into the Model Railroad Industry Association (now the Hobby Manufacturers Association) Hall of Fame in 2003. Bowser died on December 11, 2009. Move to Pennsylvania Since 1961 the company has been owned by the English family and located in Pennsylvania. The assets of Penn Line Manufacturing were purchased as a bankruptcy sale in 1963, which included the tooling and parts inventory for several steam locomotive models based on Pennsylvania Railroad designs. In 1965 the English family moved the company to Mountoursville, Pennsylvania, and focused full-time on model production. Soon after, Pennsylvania Scale Models' owner Felix Bass sold his company to English, adding several models of electric trolleys to the Bowser line. In 1975, sons Lewis English, Jr., and Lee K. English joined the company. In 1985, Bowser acquired Cal Scale from John Anderson and Harry Parker of Fresno, California, which added thousands of lost-wax brass steam locomotive detail parts. Don Stromberg sold Cary Locomotive Works to Bowser in 1988, which added several cast-metal diesel and steam locomotive bodies to the growing catalog. The old Menzies line of freight car kits was acquired from D.J. Baker Co. in 1990. Around the same time, Bowser added a paint booth and pad printing machine to their manufacturing facility. Bowser purchased Arbor Models in 1991. Expansion into N scale came in 1999 with the purchase of Delaware Valley Car Company. In 2004, Bowser acquired Stewart Hobbies from Steve Stewart. Lew English, Sr., died on February 3, 2012. The company produces model railroad locomotives, railroad cars, kits and a wide selection of parts directed at the more serious model railroad enthusiast. Bowser's significance for the model railroad community lies not only in the products that Bowser itself originated, but also in those originally produced by other companies. The latter includes products originally made by Penn Line Manufacturing, Varney, Cary and Pittman motors.

Path 61 is part of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council's links of electrical intertie paths in the western United States.This line is an important connection between two out of the four parts that make up the massive Path 46 transmission system in southeast California since the line allows power flow to be rerouted on Path 46 when necessary. Half of the length of the 500 kV power line is owned by SCE to the south and LADW&P; to the north. The entire line is located in the Mojave Desert and the High Desert regions of California.Route descriptions and tower designs are based on Google Earth images. Route Starting from the SCE Lugo substation, where many other Southern California Edison power transmission lines interconnect, the Path 61 500 kV power line heads north-northeast along with other lower voltage 220 kV and 230 kV power lines for a short distance before turning northwest, traveling though the southwestern portion of Hesperia and spanning over Interstate 15 about 2 miles north of the interchange with Main Street.

It consists of two separate segments: * Junction with Interstate 90 and U.S. Highway 83 near Vivian to South Dakota Highway 44 east of Wood. This segment is in length. * U.S. Highway 18 west of Winner to the Nebraska border southeast of Keyapaha. This segment is in length. History South Dakota 53 in 1926 ran from the North Dakota to Nebraska borders. By 1929, when U.S. Highway 83 was first designated, it replaced the segment of SD 53 from Pierre to the North Dakota border. The southern segment was further east than the present route, running from Presho south to the Nebraska border via Winner. In the early 1930s, U.S. 83 was extended south into Nebraska, and was placed as dual signage along SD 53. (The original route was on what is now U.S. Highway 183; 83 and 183 were reversed from current alignments when first designated.) By 1935, SD 53 was removed from this alignment and placed on a new route extending south from Vivian, on a previously unnumbered road. The southern terminus was at South Dakota Highway 40 (now 44). Also at this time, the northern terminus was pulled back to Vivian. In the late 1960s, a second segment of SD 53 was added further south, beginning at U.S. Highway 18 just west of the U.S. 183 junction, and extending south to Clearfield. In 1996, the southern terminus of SD 53 was extended to the Nebraska border.

The limestone building has 15 stories with a basement and sub-basement beneath. There is no 13th floor as superstitions ran high during this time period. Much of the decorated facade plays homage to the printing and publishing businesses. Two hundred feet above the street stand four pillars at each of the tower's corners; they represent patriotism, truth, speed, and progress. The newspaper plant occupied the first six stories. The floors above were offices. The Cincinnati Times- Star was an outgrowth of several newspapers and was owned by Cincinnati's Taft family. Charles Phelps Taft was editor. Before moving into the Times-Star Building on Broadway on January 1, 1933, the newspaper's offices were on Sixth and Walnut streets. When the Times-Star folded in 1958, its assets were purchased by its rival, The Cincinnati Post, who moved into the building and occupied it until 1984. Hamilton County bought the building in the late 1980s and renamed it the 800 Broadway Building. It is used for county offices and by the Juvenile Court.

He told everyone in the meeting that tomorrow all of us will be going for hunting expedition into the forest taking only swords but no guns. Next day, Bhai Taloka went to the forest as ordered by Nawab for hunting even though he did not want to kill any animal. The herd of deer passed in front of Bhai Taloka and he used his sword to kill the last female deer in the herd. The female deer died along with two of her unborn fawns. Bhai Taloka was very upset watching the tragic scene in front of him. His intention was to kill just one deer and not three! He went home and as it was nearly 5:30 pm, started to recite Rehras Paath; the scenes of the killed female deer and her unborn calves were flashing before his eyes and he could not concentrate on Paath. Just before falling asleep, Bhai Sahib ji recited Kirtan Sohila, and again the tragic scene of the three dead deer flashed continuously before his eyes. He got up at Amrit vela and the same scene started flashing in his mind again. He asked Waheguru to forgive him for what he had done and he replaced his iron sword with a wooden sword. Someone complained to Nawab that your General Bhai Taloka is keeping wooden sword and what he would do if there is a battle to be fought. The Nawab did not believe the complainer but the complainer asked Nawab to check everyone's sword at the parade that morning. The complainer further told the Nawab that if Bhai Taloka carries a wooden sword then he should be punished else the Nawab could punish the complainer. Nawab went to the parade and announced that he wished to inspect everyone's swords. He said that as he approached each soldier, they should present their sword. Bhai Taloka knew someone has complained because Nawab never came before to inspect their swords. Nawab started inspecting from soldier and lower rank officers and finally to General. Bhai Taloka immediately started doing Ardas to Waheguru. Bhai Taloka's Ardas was accepted. When Nawab came to inspect his sword, Bhai Taloka took out a shining iron sword out of the cover.

However, he chose to attend Davidson College. He was a member of the Sigma chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order. At the time, Davidson had no soccer pedigree, but Ukrop brought it into national prominence during his four and a half seasons there. His junior year, Ukrop scored 22 goals and assisted on 12, earning him second team All American honors.NCAA All Americans-searchable by name However, he broke his leg at the start of the 1991 season. As a result, he was a medical redshirt that year, but came back strong in 1992. In 1992, his last season at Davidson, Ukrop led the nation in scoring, bagging 31 goals and assisting on 10 others. He also led Davidson to the NCAA Final Four only to fall to San Diego 3‚Äì2 in overtime in the semifinals. That year, Ukrop was named a first team All American and the ISAA Player of the Year. He finished his four years at Davidson with the school record in career goals (76), points (184) and assists. His points total is almost double the next player on the points list. While still at Davidson, Ukrop played with the U.S. national B Team. After graduating from Davidson in 1993 with a bachelor's degree in classical studies, Ukrop went to the World University Games with the U.S. U-23 national team. He scored two goals and added an assist in the U.S. victory over Italy. That summer he also joined the Richmond Kickers of the USISL.

Plot After struggling with infertility, Anne (Daryl Hannah) finally succeeds in getting pregnant through invitro fertilization with her husband Jack (Bruce Greenwood). However, one night, Anne awakens to discover a masked intruder in her room. Terrified, Anne tries to escape, but the intruder chloroforms her into unconsciousness, rendering her helpless as he kidnaps her and takes her to an isolated house. In the morning, Anne finds herself held captive by a couple named Frank (Vincent Gallo) and Helen (Jennifer Tilly). Helen has gone mad after her baby was aborted by Frank upon learning that it would have been born deformed. The procedure left her sterile, and he is now attempting to make it up to her by giving her Anne's baby. Anne recognizes Frank as a technician at her fertility clinic, and Helen later tells her that he secretly replaced her fertilized egg with one of Helen's instead. Frank stages a car accident with a horribly burned body to make everyone believe Anne is dead; Jack refuses to accept it and pressures the police to continue investigating, but after several months they dismiss his ideas. After dealing with several escape attempts, Frank finds himself frustrated both with Helen's bipolar insanity and her refusal to have sex with him while she is \\"pregnant\\", and he attempts to force himself on Anne before being interrupted by Helen. Frank chases Anne outdoors while Helen terrorizes a diaper service saleswoman. Subsequently, Frank attempts a forcible amniocentesis, against Helen's wishes, and during the argument he lets it slip that he never switched her eggs. Helen snaps; she kills, dismembers, and cooks Frank's body. Her increasing madness leads her to threaten Anne with a caesarean section, and Anne finally manages to escape. She calls Jack from a nearby phone booth, but Helen runs it down with her truck in the middle of the call. Although she chases and shoots at Anne, Anne cuts her face with broken glass and runs, collapsing on the roadside where she is found by a local teenager. The police still refuse to believe Jack's story, even after seeing the damage to the phone booth, so Jack travels to the house Anne described, only to be ambushed by Helen with a baseball bat. Helen then kills a nurse at the hospital and again kidnaps Anne to force her into having the baby. Helen decides to allow her to have a natural birth rather than a C-section, but Anne manages to break free, and after a violent struggle she wraps one of her chains around Helen's neck and strangles her. Helen rises up for one final shot but misses and dies. As the police take Helen's body away, Anne emerges from the house with Jack and her new baby. Reception Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club gave the film a very bad review, stating: \\"Director Sidney J. Furie's (Ladybugs, Iron Eagle 4) latest is bereft of suspense, but so full of embarrassing low points that it's impossible to single out just one. Who could choose between seeing Hannah force-fed against her will through a tube and watching Tilly yell at the grotesque doll baby she's attached to her stomach to simulate pregnancy? For that matter, who could choose between Gallo forcing a very-pregnant Hannah to run in front of his tractor as exercise and Tilly threatening to perform a makeshift caesarian on Hannah with a pair of sharp scissors? It all adds up to one of the most deeply unpleasant films in recent memory, ineptly executed schlock that's as fun to watch as videotaped footage of terrified real-life hostages blankly reiterating their captors' demands.\\" Mitch from \\"The Video Vacuum\\" gave it two stars and wrote: \\"Hide and Seek has a solid enough premise. It's just that the script plays all its cards too soon and things fizzle out long before the finale. Fans of Tilly will want to check it out just to see her do her thing, but all in all, it's not worth seeking out.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Cord\\" currently holds 39% of audience aprovation.

In December 1998, the ITQ and QQQ signals ‚Äì then known as Queensland Satellite Television, or QSTV, and owned by Telecasters Australia Limited (previously Telecasters North Queensland) ‚Äì were officially aggregated with that of Imparja Television into a Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence area. Previously, QSTV serviced western parts of Queensland and New South Wales, while Imparja serviced the Northern Territory (excluding Darwin), and remote South Australia and Victoria, plus far-western New South Wales (excluding Broken Hill). As part of the aggregation, the Australian Broadcasting Authority further extended the combined licence area to cover more remote areas of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, who were not fully served by regularly licensed terrestrial television services.Australian Broadcasting Authority (23 December 1998).

However, unlike other Southern Cross-owned stations ‚Äì including TND, which at the time was a dual Seven/Ten affiliate under the Southern Cross Television brand ‚Äì QQQ/ITQ simply carried the Seven Network branding unchanged, leading some people to continue to refer it as \\"Seven Central\\". The station carried a simple \\"SCTV\\" text watermark in lieu of independent branding, denoting the origin of the signal. (Previously, the watermark has read \\"TAL\\" and \\"SCB\\", denoting the previous owners. \\"MSCM\\" was used briefly after the Macquarie acquisition.) On 19 May 2010, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) approved a licence for Central Digital Television, a third digital-only network to be jointly owned by Imparja Television and Southern Cross Austereo. The network launched on 30 June 2010 on the Viewer Access Satellite Television service. The same day, Southern Cross Central began broadcasting SCTV Central, SCTV Central HD and 7Two Central to coincide with the first analog television transmitter switch off in Mildura, Victoria. This was so viewers in the area who lost adequate television coverage were able to utilise VAST as an alternative source. VAST officially launched on 10 December 2010, and began granting access to viewers in the Remote Central and Eastern Australia licence areas. This brought digital television to satellite viewers in the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia for the first time. Digital terrestrial transmissions began in Alice Springs, Northern Territory and Mount Isa, Queensland on 2 May 2011, with other areas launching between 2012 and 2013. Optus Aurora, the satellite service preceding VAST, was closed down on 10 December 2013. News updates Under previous owners, a local Seven News bulletin for Darwin and Central Australia was produced until 2000. Separate news update services for remote Australia were introduced in 2005 before being merged with updates for Darwin into one service in 2013. The shared three-minute short news updates throughout the day are broadcast on ITQ/QQQ serving remote areas and TND in Darwin, presented from Southern Cross Austereo's studio in Canberra.

Lanigan Ernest John Lanigan (January 4, 1873 in Chicago, Illinois - February 6, 1962 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) was an American sportswriter and historian on the subject of baseball. He was considered the premier baseball statistician and historian of his day. He was a pioneer at gathering information about baseball statistics and about the players themselves, and was the author of the first encyclopedia of the subject. In addition to having parents who were both writers and editors (George Thomas Lanigan and Bertha Spink Lanigan ), Lanigan was the nephew, on his mother's side, of The Sporting News founders Al Spink and Charles Spink, and one of five men in his family, including J. G. Taylor Spink and C.C. Johnson Spink, to gain acclaim as a newspaperman. Shortly after The Sporting News was launched in the mid-1880s, 15-year-old Lanigan went to work for his uncles. He served three years at the paper, then made a career change and became a bank clerk for the next eight years. His knowledge of baseball and writing, and his passion for numbers, accrued from those two jobs, would serve him well in the future. However, he also came down with a lung infection, possibly pneumonia, which affected his health for the remainder of his long life. During a two-year convalescence in the Adirondack Mountains, he continued his baseball stat gathering for The Sporting News, as he had during his banking career, and began inventing new statistics. The best known of these were the RBI and the CS, which he researched and catalogued, and which were eventually adopted as official major league statistics. He also developed a more comprehensive list of Winning Pitcher and Losing Pitcher compilations. Over the course of his career he also worked for the New York Press as sports editor until 1911, and was the official scorer for some of the early World Series; as sports editor for the Cleveland Leader. He worked as secretary and information director of the International League around the time when they were reorganizing from their previous incarnation as the Eastern League. At one time he was also the business manager of a couple of St. Louis Cardinals farm teams. Lanigan also wrote for Baseball Magazine, and it was under that banner that he compiled and published the first baseball encyclopedia, which he called The Baseball Cyclopedia, in 1922. The publisher advertised on the book's title page that it \\"comprises a review of Professional Baseball, the history of all Major League Clubs, playing records and unique events, the batting, pitching and base running champions, World's Series' statistics and a carefully arranged alphabetical list of the records of more than 3500 Major League ball players, a feature never before attempted in print.\\" In addition to the original publication of 1922, 12 annual supplements were published. The supplement claimed to contain \\"a complete up-to-date supplement of recent records\\" and retailed for $1.00. In 1946, Lanigan was named curator of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and later served as its historian. He held that post until he retired in 1959, when he was replaced by Lee Allen, who continued Lanigan's work in compiling biographical stats on players. Lanigan was called \\"Ernie\\" by his friends. He was also given the not-necessarily- flattering nickname of \\"Figure Filbert\\" (or \\"Figger Filbert\\") by Damon Runyon, as a more poetic way of saying \\"numbers nut\\". Lanigan affirmed that characterization, as he once confided to fellow baseball writer Fred Lieb: \\"I really don't care much about baseball, or looking at ball games, major or minor. All my interest in baseball is in its statistics. I want to know something about every major league ball player, not only what he is hitting, but his full name with all middle names and initials, where they were born, and where they live now.\\" Lieb, who was still among the living at Lanigan's centennial in 1973, called him \\"the patron saint of SABR\\".

As an ANCSA corporation, Ukpeaƒ°vik I√±upiat Corporation has no publicly traded stock and its shares cannot legally be sold. Lands When the United States purchased the Alaskan Territory from Russia in 1867, the only land ownership recognized by American law was that obtained by Russian title. Like the Native Americans of the 48 contiguous states, Alaskan Natives were granted claims to ancestral lands, but had no citizenship rights. When Alaskan statehood was granted in 1959, the federal government claimed most of the land. In response, Alaskan Natives began to dispute government claims, making \\"who owns Alaska\\" a national issue, particularly after oil was discovered on the Northern Slope. In response, Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971, extinguishing Alaska Native land claims in exchange for about 11 percent of Alaska plus $962.5 million. By conveying Native land title to 12 regional and 200 local village corporations, the ANCSA changed the relationship between Natives and the land from communal tenure to corporate ownership. As a result, the I√±upiat people of Utqiagvik, Alaska, the northernmost community in the United States located 330 miles north of the Arctic Circle, established the Ukpeaƒ°vik I√±upiat Corporation (UIC). Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow, named for Sir John Barrow who led the first polar expedition to the area, was called Ukpeaƒ°vik, or place to hunt snowy owls\\" by the I√±upiat people.

Starting as a private property, the park has had several owners and uses before its present one, the City of Richmond. History The first documented owner was William Byrd III (1728‚Äì1777), son of William Byrd II (1674‚Äì1744), founder of the city of Richmond. Like his father, the younger Byrd owned extensive properties in Richmond along the James (James River (Virginia)), and in 1768 he sought to repay his extensive gambling debts by auctioning off 100 of his lots in a public auction. As a result, some between Reedy Creek and Powhite Creek came to be owned by Bernard Markham. =Rhodes family= In 1820, Holden Rhodes (born Canada, 1798‚Äì99; died Richmond, Virginia, 1857) a graduate of Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont, went to Manchester, near Richmond, to tutor the sons of Judge Samuel Taylor. Rhodes eventually studied law and became a noted jurist in the Chesterfield County court systems, as well as a railroad entrepreneur, being one of the first presidents of the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, chartered in 1836 and opened in 1838 (later the Atlantic Coast Line, now part of CSX Transportation). After Rhodes married Eliza Anne Cunliffe Heth (daughter of Midlothian coal mine owner John Cunliffe and widow of Henry Heth, the son of Harry Heth, another coal mine owner) in 1833, he purchased , known as \\"Dunstan's,\\" from John N. Dunstan, Jr. Rhodes built his country estate, \\"Boscobel\\" (from the Italian word for \\"beautiful woods\\") some time between 1836 and 1843. The house, now known as the Old Stone House in Forest Hill Park, was constructed of granite that is believed to have been quarried on the property. When Rhodes died in 1857, his estate passed to his nephew and adopted son, Charles H. Rhodes, Jr. In 1862, during the American Civil War (1860‚Äì1865) young Rhodes sold the property to Richard D. Mitchell, and the estate was eventually sold, in turn, to James and Charles Labott, and later to William H. Benson, who in 1871 sold it to a group of New York investors. =Amusement park= In 1889, the former Rhodes property was sold to the Southside Land and Improvement Co., and became a terminus for the Forest Hill trolley, part of one of the first successful trolley systems in the United States. The Virginia Passenger and Power Company (later VEPCO, now Dominion Energy) took over the enterprise in 1925. To attract passengers to the countryside, the Rhodes residence was converted into a trolley terminus, complete with wrap-around porch and belfry, and an elaborate turn-of-the-20th- century amusement park was built on the grounds, complete with carousel, roller coaster, fun house, dance hall, penny arcade, and golf course, as well as bath house, swimming area, and boat lake in the former quarry pond. The park remained a popular Richmond attraction until it closed in 1932, due to the economic constraints of the Great Depression. =City park= When the land was deeded to the City of Richmond in 1933, the wooden amusement structures were demolished to convert the dilapidated estate into a landscaped urban park. The Rhodes home was renovated to serve as a community library and meeting house, and the wooded ravine that once held a quarry pond and boating lake returned to its natural state. During the Works Progress Administration (1935‚Äì1943), unemployed craftsmen and stonemasons working under the auspices of the National Relief Act were hired to pave the old park footpaths with cobblestones, adding a stone-and-slate octagonal gazebo and a small warming hut for use by winter ice-skaters. New landscaping features included a small azalea garden that later provided plant stock for the extensive Joseph Bryan Park Azalea Garden, on Richmond's North Side. The new Forest Hill Park soon became a quieter, more restful place for family picnics, strolling, hiking, and bird-watching. In the 1940s, the Forest Hill Garden Club received a national garden club award for its plantings of native Virginia species in a area of the park's wooded slopes. From the 1970s until the present, due to extensive development upstream along Reedy Creek, storm sediment turned the park's pond into a de facto wetland and wildlife refuge, attracting animals rarely found in city parks ‚Äì including bald eagle, river otter, and great blue heron. The park, though a favorite for neighboring residents, suffered a long decline through lack of repair. In October, 2009, the City of Richmond completed dredging/restoration of the original lake, the creation of a managed wetlands silt capture system to both provide biodiverse habitat as well as prevent future silting of the lake, and the restoration of the park stonework and structures. Various improvements to the once neglected park are continuing for 2010, including the creation of a new trails network and the construction of a new pedestrian bridge over Reedy Creek. In 2002, Forest Hill Park was placed on the Virginia and the National Registers of Historic Places, for its distinction as an early trolley terminus, its WPA features, and its pivotal role in the development of the South Richmond neighborhoods of Forest Hill, Woodland Heights, and Westover Hills. Present day Since 1997, Friends of Forest Hill Park, a volunteer support group, has been working with the City of Richmond's Department of Parks and Recreation, along with the Forest Hill Neighborhood Association, the Richmond Recreation and Parks Foundation and the Richmond chapter of M.O.R.E., to ensure that Forest Hill Park continues to serve visitors' recreational needs for generations to come.

History SD 25 was established in 1926, with its southern terminus in Howard. It was then established from what is now SD 262, northwest of Emery, northward. The SD 25 designation was applied northward from this intersection as construction of the roadway was completed. The northern terminus of this segment was at Farmer by 1971, Epiphany by 1977, and the Howard area by 1981. Originally, SD 25 went through Howard, but was shifted west approximately in the early 1950s. On the north end, SD 25 used a zigzag path north from De Smet; in 1927, it went through Clark to Webster, then west about before heading north to Britton and the North Dakota state line northeast of Kidder. The path north of US 12 is now SD 27\\\\. In the mid-1950s, the highway was shifted eastward to travel straight north from De Smet to US 212 east of Clark. Then, after a jog to the east, it traveled north to Webster, and then resumed its previous alignment to North Dakota. In 1976, SD 25 was shifted eastward to use the path of former SD 23 from Webster to Lake City. It then curved northeast through Veblen and north again at Hammer (on the former path of SD 15). The southern segment was the path of former SD 35\\\\. This was redesignated as part of SD 25 in 1976.

\\"Bear\\", was an American professional baseball right-handed pitcher and pitching coach, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between and for the Philadelphia Phillies, Cincinnati Reds and Houston Astros. He appeared in 286 big league games. During his playing days, Owens stood tall, weighing . Early baseball career Originally signed by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1951 as an unsigned free agent out of Bradford Area High School. Owens racked up impressive win totals in minor league baseball, with 22, 22 and 17 victories posted in levels ranging from Class D to Triple-A from 1952 to 1954. In 1955, he made the Phillies' Opening Day roster and started two April games. In his debut April 19 against the eventual 1955 world champion Brooklyn Dodgers, Owens was effective for his first five innings pitched, allowing only two runs to the powerful Dodgers. But in the sixth, after a 36-minute rain delay, Owens surrendered home runs to Carl Furillo and Roy Campanella and was chased from the mound with the Phillies trailing, 5‚Äì0. Five days later, starting against 1955's cellar-dwellers, the Pittsburgh Pirates, he lasted only 1 innings before, struggling with his control, he was removed from the game. Philadelphia lost the game 6‚Äì1 and Owens absorbed his second straight loss. Owens was sent back to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, where he had another banner year, winning 15 games before his recall in September 1955. The 1956 season began in similar fashion, as Owens was treated harshly in two early- season starts (against the Pirates and the Cincinnati Redlegs). He worked in ten MLB games that year (five in relief), and got into 15 games at Triple-A. He was winless in four decisions for the 1956 Phillies, and his record in his first two years in the National League was poor: 0‚Äì6, with an earned run average of 7.51. One stellar season for the Phillies Owens then spent all of 1957, and all but one game in 1958, in military service. In his one game pitched in 1958, on September 23 against the pennant-bound Milwaukee Braves, he hurled seven strong innings for the win, allowing two earned runs. His best season was 1959: to complement a solid ERA of 3.21, Owens went 12‚Äì12 for a last-place team, with 11 complete games and 135 strikeouts in 221 innings of work. But in 1960, he went 4‚Äì14 (5.04) and in 1961 his record was 5‚Äì10 (4.47). The Phillies finished in the NL basement each season, and Owens received notoriety for his off-field carousing as a member (with fellow pitchers Turk Farrell, Jack Meyer and Seth Morehead) of the \\"Dalton Gang,\\" Retrieved July 21, 2016. a group of hard-drinking players in frequent conflict with the Phillies' management. After Owens' poor 1962 season‚Äîa 2‚Äì4 record with a 6.33 ERA‚Äîthe Phillies traded him to Cincinnati for second baseman Cookie Rojas. He was used almost entirely as a reliever in a partial season with the 1963 Reds. On April 21 of that year, he set a National League record by balking three times in one inning. (Bob Shaw broke that record less than a month later when he balked five times in one frame.) Overall, Owens posted an ERA of 5.31 in 19 games that year, including three starting assignments. He was sent to Triple-A San Diego, where he appeared in eight games. Then, in December, the Astros (then nicknamed the Colt .45s) took him in the 1963 Rule 5 draft. Reliever and coach for the Astros He spent the final four seasons of his career with the Astros, reunited with Farrell until May 8, 1967, when Farrell was traded. Owens was used almost entirely as a reliever for Houston, pitching in a total of 148 games and starting only 11 (all in 1964). Owens led the team in relief appearances in 1965 with 50. He played his final big league game on June 20, 1967. Eighteen days later, on July 8, Owens retired from the field to become the Astros' pitching coach, succeeding the fired Gordon Jones. He held that job through the end of the 1972 season, working with hurlers such as Mike Cuellar, Larry Dierker and Don Wilson. Overall, Owens' pitching record was 42‚Äì68 with a 4.31 ERA. Of the 286 games he appeared in, he started 103 of them, completing 21 of the starts and tossing one shutout. In 885 innings, he gave up 84 home runs, walked 340 batters and struck out 516. In 218 at-bats, Owens collected only 22 hits for a .101 batting average and struck out 102 times. He had a .954 fielding percentage.

Produced by MGM, it is about a soldier, returning home from war, who does not wish to work for his father's opera company or to continue his relationship with his pre-war lover. The film was shot in color and partly on location at the Grand Hotel, on Mackinac Island in Michigan.http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=253042&mainArticleId;=253038 This Time for Keeps became the second film in which Williams's name was first billed above the title, after Fiesta. Plot Richard Herald (Lauritz Melchior) is a famous opera singer and father to Richard Herald II, who has recently returned from fighting in the war and now prefers to be known as Dick Johnson (Johnnie Johnston). Dick has been engaged to socialite Frances Allenbury (Mary Stuart) since before he left for the war, but has been expressing some apprehension about marrying her. Mr. Herald wants his son to join him at the opera company, but Dick wants to enjoy his life now that he's out of the army. Backstage at the theater, he sees a magazine featuring Leonora \\"Nora\\" Cambaretti, an aquacade star. Earlier, as it turns out, after Dick received an injury during the war, he stayed at a hospital where Leonora performed for the patients. Dick had yet to have his bandages removed from his eyes and head, so he couldn't see Nora. Other servicemen described her beauty to him, as her family's friend, Ferdi Farro (Jimmy Durante), played on the piano. Thinking he was blind, Nora allowed Dick to touch her face and then kissed him, only to then find out that he was able to see. Nora is now performing as the star of the Aqua Capers show. Dick surprises her there, and he reminds her of their previous meeting by giving her a quick kiss, getting his nose twisted as punishment. Nora knows Dick is there to flirt, but she offers him a job with the show, but Ferdi convinces his friend Xavier Cugat to give Dick a position as a baritone at his nightclub. Esther Williams as Leonora 'Nora' Cambaretti and Johnnie Johnston as Dick Johnson After an Aqua Capers performance, Dick and Nora go to dinner. Ferdi reminds her that she barely knows anything about Dick. At rehearsal the next day, Nora says before she can fall in love, Dick must pass inspection from her family back on Mackinac Island. Dick leaves with Nora while Frances's mother, Harriet, meets with Richard and agrees to announce their children's engagement, unbeknownst to Dick. On the island, Dick meets Nora's grandmother (May Whitty) and niece Deborah (Sharon McManus), who warm up to him after he sings Grandmother's favorite song, \\"(I‚Äôll be with You) In Apple Blossom Time\\". Nora's grandmother grants her approval of Dick for Nora. A bit later, Dick leaves to tell his father about his relationship with Nora and break off the engagement to Frances, which Dick has not told Nora about. Gordon finds the engagement announcement in the newspaper and shows it to Ferdi. Ferdi tells Nora about it, and she is heartbroken. Gordon arranges for her to stay somewhere Dick can't find her. Six weeks later, Mr. Herald arrives at an Aqua Capers rehearsal in an attempt to find Nora, but Ferdi will not tell him where she is. Ferdi goes to Xavier Cugat's club to see Dick, who accuses Ferdi of being in love with Nora as well. The Grand Hotel, where the film was shot Meanwhile, summer arrives on Mackinac Island and tourists are flocking there. Cugat's band has a contract to perform at the Grand Hotel, and Dick goes with them. Deborah, knowing that Nora (traveling with Gordon and Ferdi) has arrived by boat, hurries to the hotel and notifies Dick, who loads Deborah onto her bicycle and together they ride to the Cambaretti house to speak with Nora. This trip, Nora has brought Gordon for her grandmothers' approval. Dick and Deborah walk in, and Dick tries to explain all that has happened. Nora remains confused and upset and rejects him, so he leaves. Nora and Deborah both start to cry and flee upstairs, where Ferdi overhears them. He invites Mr. Herald to the island, where he apologizes to Grandmother Cambaretti for placing the announcement in the newspaper. He also recognizes her from her old days as a performer in the circus. The two decide that their children should be married and come up with a way to push the two together. While Nora is at the swimming pool of the hotel, teaching Deborah to dive and swim, Dick begins singing \\"Easy to Love\\" with Cugat's female vocalist, which makes Deborah jealous. That night, Nora decides she is going to go after Gordon, but Ferdi convinces her otherwise. Mr. Herald takes Grandmother to listen to Dick's performance at the hotel, where he convinces Cugat to fire his son and then begins to sing for the audience. He stops singing \\"La donna √® mobile\\" and begins \\"Easy to Love\\", during which Dick gets up and sits next to Nora, where they hold hands and snuggle.

Van Johnson was originally announced as Esther's co-star. He was eventually replaced by Johnny Johnston, who had just appeared in MGM's Till the Clouds Roll By. This was the third of four films Williams made with director Richard Thorpe. Williams disliked Thorpe from the start, and the feeling was mutual. \\"Dick didn't like people who were too cheerful, which meant that he took an instant dislike to me\\", wrote Williams in her autobiography. =Shooting= Filming took place in July 1946 and included location shooting on Mackinac Island. Esther Williams was pregnant during the filming of This Time for Keeps, but later suffered a miscarriage.The Million Dollar Mermaid: An Autobiography, By Esther Williams, Digby Diehl, Published by Harcourt Trade, 2000, , To convey the sense of outdoorsy, country small town life in the film, Irene decided to use a lot of plaid in the costumes. She designed a swimsuit for Williams made out of lumberjack plaid flannel. \\"It absorbed water like crazy. I dove into the pool and tried to swim, but the suit just dragged me to the bottom. It was like trying to swim while wrapped in an old army blanket.

Background Selma Kurz was born in Biala to a very humble Jewish family of eleven children. She grew up in Bielitz. While still a girl, she was taken to a convent to be trained as a seamstress. The nuns quickly discovered the beauty of her voice, however, and she also often sang in the local synagogue. These circumstances led local people to raise some money so that she could go to Vienna and audition for Professor G√§nsbacher, a prominent vocal teacher who did not teach women, but wrote important letters of recommendation. Little Selma was thus enabled to visit the imposing Schloss Totis, the Viennese residence, en vill√©ggiature, of the famous patron of the arts count Nicholas (Mikl√≥s) Esterh√°zy de Gal√°ntha, who agreed to pay for her lessons with another prominent vocal pedagogue, Johannes Ress. Once her career was established, Kurz consulted such world- renowned voice teachers as Jean de Reszke in Nice and Mathilde Marchesi in Paris, as well as the soprano Felicie Kaschowska, well known in Vienna; but she always called herself, above all, a pupil of Ress. Career=D√©but= She was first heard in Vienna at a student concert of Ress pupils on March 22, 1895. She got good notices and offers poured from many opera houses, especially the ones in provincial Germany, which were always looking for new talent. She made her d√©but in the title role of Ambroise Thomas's opera Mignon at the Hamburg Stadttheater, on May 12, 1895. She appeared there and at Frankfurt am Main for the next four seasons, singing diverse roles including Eudoxie in Hal√©vy's La Juive, Elisabeth in Wagner's Tannh√§user and Bizet's Carmen. =Vienna= Gustav Mahler, music director of the Vienna Imperial and Royal Court Opera, heard Kurz in Frankfurt towards the end of 1898 and asked her to audition for him. He immediately offered her a contract and she made her d√©but at the theatre that would become her artistic and spiritual home, also as Mignon, on September 3, 1899. Her success in Vienna was swift and total, and lasted to the end of her musical career, thirty years later. Mahler himself, hearing her perfect trill and wonderfully placed high notes in Leonora's Act IV aria in Il trovatore, suggested that she ought to study the Hochkoloratur repertory, in which she would become the Hofoper's prima donna assoluta. The Court Opera director carefully introduced her to this repertoire by letting her sing Rosina (in The Barber of Seville), the pages Urbain in Les Huguenots and Oscar in Un ballo in maschera, Juliette and Martha; but she soon moved on to Elvira in Ernani, Lakm√©, Konstanze, Gilda, Violetta (in La traviata) and, last but not least, Lucia di Lammermoor. Mahler fell in love with Selma, and they had a short affair during the spring of 1900. But the Court Opera did not allow their members to marry among themselves, and Selma opted to continue her career. It was Kurz's legendary singing in Mahler's 1903 revival of Un ballo in maschera as well as in Goldmark's The Queen of Sheba, that cemented her immense popularity with the Viennese public. (As Astaroth in The Queen of Sheba, perhaps her most famous role, she held audiences spellbound with her vocalization of the so-called Lockruf or 'Siren Call.') It also led to her being elevated to the position of Kaiserliche und K√∂nigliche Kammers√§ngerin ('Imperial and Royal Court Singer') at the age of 29. She was often thereafter in attendance of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, always a devoted admirer of her art. In the year-long Mozart festival performances organized to celebrate the composer's 150th birthday, Kurz sang Fiordiligi in Cos√¨ fan tutte in 1905 and Konstanze in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail a year later. Also in 1906, on the occasion of a much-acclaimed Caruso gala, she sang Gilda in Rigoletto, with Titta Ruffo in the title role. This was Ruffo's only appearance in Vienna. Although she had great triumphs in coloratura roles, Kurz did not neglect her lyric repertory. Indeed, of the 992 performances she would give at the Vienna Hofoper (later Staatsoper), more than 100 would be devoted to Mim√¨ in Puccini's La boh√®me. She also created that composer's Madama Butterfly for Vienna (1907) as well as Saffi in Johann Strauss's Der Zigeunerbaron (1910). She sang Tatiana (Eugene Onegin) and Sophie (Der Rosenkavalier) in 1911 and, in one of the many high points of her Viennese career, created Zerbinetta in the world premi√®re of the second version of Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, on October 4, 1916. She sang Zerbinetta 36 times in Vienna. In Vienna she sang every imaginable role, from Tchaikovsky's Iolanta and Wagner's Elsa (in Lohengrin) and Sieglinde (in Die Walk√ºre) to Marguerite in Gounod's Faust, Massenet's Manon, Frau Fluth in Nicolai's The Merry Wives of Windsor and Rosalinde in Johann Strauss II's Die Fledermaus. Next to Mim√¨ in La boh√®me, her most frequently heard roles were Gilda, Violetta and the Trovatore Leonora. Her last performance at the great theatre in the Ringstra√üe, where so many of her triumphs had been acclaimed by two generations of opera lovers from all over Europe and the world, took place on February 12, 1927. This appearance, as Rosina in The Barber of Seville, closed one of the most glorious operatic careers in the twentieth century. Her very last public appearance occurred in September 1932 at the baptism of Archduke Stefan (1932‚Äì1998), son of Archduke Anton and Princess Ileana of Romania. Although already mortally ill, the Imperial and Royal Kammers√§ngerin sang Mozart's Ridente la calma and the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria as a gesture to the baby's grandmother, Queen Marie of Rumania, who had long been a close personal friend. She died nine months later. =Her career outside Vienna= Form the outset Selma Kurz was widely required all over Europe and she appeared successfully in both opera and concert at the Grand Op√©ra in Paris, the Princely Op√©ra in Monte Carlo, Rome, Salzburg, Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, Amsterdam, Ostend, Bucharest and Cairo. In London she was first heard in May 1904 in Rigoletto, with Enrico Caruso and Maurice Renaud. She then sang her famous page, Oscar, in Un ballo in maschera, with Giannina Russ, Caruso, Antonio Scotti and Marcel Journet. The following year she again sang A Masked Ball with Caruso and Mario Sammarco as well as her other favourite page role, Urbain in Les Huguenots, opposite Emmy Destinn, Caruso, Scotti, Journet and Clarence Whitehill. She also appeared in Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette opposite Charles Dalmor√®s' Romeo. She also repeated, in these two seasons of coloratura successes, her Elisabeth in Tannh√§user, with Karel Burian in the title role. In 1907 she was heard again at Covent Garden, this time in Lucia di Lammermoor, with Alessandro Bonci as Edgardo. She repeated Rigoletto (with Bonci and Sammarco) and Un ballo in maschera (with Amedeo Bassi) and added Catalani's Loreley, obviously a Bassi vehicle. She was then not heard at the Royal Opera until 1924, when she sang La boh√®me and La traviata. Her London appearances were extremely successful, notwithstanding the enmity of the all- powerful Nellie Melba, as entrenched at Covent Garden as Kurz was in Vienna. Selma Kurz was many times invited to appear in the United States and received several tempting offers from the Metropolitan Opera in New York. None of these managed to induce her so far from Vienna and her family. It was only in 1921 that she finally sailed for the New World, appearing one single time in concert at the New York Hippodrome. This was supposed to be the first concert of a long tour, but she immediately took ill (she had possibly had a heart attack) and the tour was cancelled. She immediately returned to Vienna, where she had a long convalescence before she could return to performing with a voice that, all agreed, was never quite the same. Last years In 1910, Selma Kurz married the noted gynecologist, Joseph Halban (1876‚Äì1937), a professor at Vienna University, who later was knighted by the Austrian Emperor, becoming Ritter Joseph von Halban. With him she had two children, D√©sir√©e (1912‚Äì1996) and (1915‚Äì1998). \\"D√©si\\" Halban became a concert soprano who, among other things, recorded Mahler's Fourth Symphony with Bruno Walter. She married Dutch art dealer Jacques Goudstikker in 1937. Notwithstanding her always delicate health, Selma von Halban-Kurz had a notably happy family life in her palatial Vienna home until, in 1929, she became ill with cancer. After a battle with this disease, she died on May 10, 1933, in Vienna. It was the municipal authorities that insisted that the great Imperial and Royal Kammers√§ngerin be buried in a lovely spot at the Zentralfriedhof, the Central Cemetery where Vienna's great sons and daughters are interred. There she lies, not far from Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Brahms. Appreciation Selma Kurz was a very beautiful woman, 1.6 m, fragile and delicate. Her appearance on stage and acting was attractive and very well received. She could make the public go mad with her long trills. People even came with stopwatches to determine that it was 'even one second longer than yesterday'.Halban, 1983 In a 1907 recording of Taubert's Der Vogel im Walde,see http://selmakurz.driebond.eu/ the trill lasts 24 seconds. \\"Selma Kurz is one of the greatest coloratura sopranos of all times. Her effortless mastering of difficult parts, the freedom of her taste of style, but above all her endless uncomparable trills can't be overestimated and she can still be admired on CD\\".Kutsch and Riemens, 1975 Recordings Selma Kurz left over 150 78-rpm recordings. The first were made for Emile Berliner in 1900. These were followed by Zonophone and Gramophone & Typewriter Company discs, dating from 1901-1906. She then made a long series for HMV (now EMI) in 1907‚Äì1914. These are by far the best of her recordings, capturing the attractiveness of her tone and the exceptional agility of her vocal technique. Around 1910, she recorded three cylinders for the Edison company. After the First World War, she recorded for Deutsche Grammophon/Polydor in 1923-24. This is a successful series of records, even though it documents a decline in the voice. In 1924‚Äì25 she again recorded for HMV, which even made a number of electrical recordings of her singing, including a remarkable version of the \\"Siren Call\\" from The Queen of Sheba, complete with her trademark trill. She recorded a number of pieces accompanied by the Czech violinist V√°≈°a P≈ô√≠hoda.

Plot The preschool-age DVD tells the story of a wooden toy train who pretends to be a real train. The main character, Busy Little Engine, appears alternately as a wooden toy train in a playroom and as a full-scale- size train in real-world backgrounds. With its intentionally gentle pacing and static camera work, it has been called \\"a young child's picture book come-to- life\\". Busy Little Engine pretends to be a real train but does not actually know what real trains do. This presents a problem which is soon solved with the help of Busy Little Engine's puppet friend, Pig, and the off-screen narrator. Through the course of the show, Busy Little Engine and Pig explore the everyday world using role-playing and imagination. Viewers learn about tangible topics such as raw goods, finished materials and basic railroad operations along with esoteric topics such as pretending, taking turns, and learning from others.

It has been estimated that worldwide close to 90% of all building is vernacular, meaning that it is for daily use for ordinary, local people and built by local craftsmen. The term vernacular architecture in general refers to the informal building of structures through traditional building methods by local builders without using the services of a professional architect. It is the most widespread form of building. In India there are numerous traditional regional styles, although there is much in common in the styles of the Hindi belt in the north. Compared to Hindu temple architecture and Indo-Saracenic architecture there was traditionally much more use of wood rather than stone, though today brick and concrete are more typical, and Indian versions of Western styles dominate in recent buildings. Categories Sandstone Haveli with jharokha windows. Toda tribal hut, often compared to ancient Gavaksha roof and arch. Indian vernacular architecture has evolved organically over time through the skillful craftsmanship of the local people. Despite the diversity, this architecture can be broadly divided into three categories. = Kachcha = A kachcha is a building made of natural materials such as mud plaster, bamboo, thatch and wood and is therefore a short-lived structure. Since it is not made for endurance it requires constant maintenance and replacement. The practical limitations of the building materials available dictate the specific form which can have a simple beauty. The advantage of a kachcha is that construction materials are cheap and easily available and relatively little labor is required. = Pakka = A pakka is a structure made from materials resistant to wear, such as forms of stone or brick, clay tiles, metal or other durable materials, sometimes using mortar to bind, that does not need to be constantly maintained or replaced. However, such structures are expensive to construct as the materials are costly and more labor is required. A pakka (or sometimes pukka) may be elaborately decorated in contrast to a kachcha. = Semi-Pukka = A combination of the kachcha and pukka style, the semi-pukka, has evolved as villagers have acquired the resources to add elements constructed of the durable materials characteristic of a pukka. Architecture as always evolves organically as the needs and resources of people change. Majority of traditional vernacular architecture falls under semi-pukka. Regional variation Building material depends on location. In hilly country where rocky rubble, ashlar, and pieces of stone are available, these can be patched together with a mud mortar to form walls. Finer stonework veneer covers the outside. Sometimes wood beams and rafters are used with slate tiles for roofing if available. Houses on hills usually have two stories, with the livestock living on the ground floor. Often a verandah runs along the side of the house. The roof is pitched to deal with the monsoon season and the house may sit on raised platform, plinths or bamboo poles to cope with floods. On the flat lands, adobes are usually made of mud or sun-baked bricks, then plastered inside and out, sometimes with mud mixed with hay or even cow dung and whitewashed with lime. Where bamboo is available it is widely used for all parts of the home as it is flexible and resilient. Also widely used is thatch from plants such as elephant grass, paddy, and coconut. In the south, clay tiles are used for pukka roofing while various plant material such as coconut palm is common for the Kamchatka. Gallery File:Pole 42.jpgTraditional decoration on wooden windows.

Historically, this category of torts was often covered by the writ of trespass vi et armis. Historically, the primary dignitary torts were battery, assault, and false imprisonment, as each claimed harm to a person's human dignity. A cause of action could be brought for battery, for example, even if no injury was done to the plaintiff, so long as the contact would be offensive to a reasonable person. Under modern jurisprudence the category of dignitary torts is more closely associated with secondary dignitary torts, most notably defamation (slander and libel), false light, intentional infliction of emotional distress, invasion of privacy, and alienation of affections. In some jurisdictions, the phrase is limited to those torts which do not require physical injury or threat of physical injury, limiting the class to only those secondary incidents. The only non-intentional act classified as a dignitary tort is negligent infliction of emotional distress, although this is also sometimes classified as simply another form of negligence.

The character usually appears in comics featuring Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Publication history The character was introduced in The Spectacular Spider-Man #107 (Oct 1985). Spider-Man-related fictional character biographies=Stanley Carter= Stanley Carter was born in Fort Meade, Maryland. He was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. working in research and development. He was injected with experimental drugs to increase strength and endurance, but when the program was designated too dangerous it was discontinued. Carter became violent and resigned from S.H.I.E.L.D., eventually becoming a detective with the New York City Police Department. After his partner was killed by several young criminals, he became obsessed with killing anyone who \\"sinned\\" by abusing authority.Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #110. Marvel Comics. As the Sin-Eater, his first victim was Captain Jean DeWolff (in \\"The Death of Jean DeWolff\\" story arc). As a detective, he is assigned to find the killer, and works closely with Spider-Man.Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #107 (October 1985). Marvel Comics. His next victim is Judge Horace Rosenthal, a friend of Matthew Murdock. During his escape after killing Rosenthal, he is attacked by Spider-Man and kills a bystander during the battle.Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #108 (November 1985). Marvel Comics. When Spider- Man and Daredevil discover that the Sin-Eater's next victim is going to be Betty Brant, Peter Parker's first love, they rush to save her. Spider-Man goes into a fierce rage and beats the Sin-Eater nearly to death. As he is being transferred to Riker's, a vengeful mob including De Wolff's father tries to kill him, but Daredevil and Spider-Man intervene. Carter is put in psychological and medical care, but is crippled by the beating Spider-Man inflicted. S.H.I.E.L.D. purge all the drugs from his system during this time, but he still has visions of his Sin-Eater persona. After Carter is released, he returns the favor Spider-Man did him by rescuing him from an angry mob, and begins writing a memoir of his career as the Sin-Eater. However, he has trouble readjusting to society. Finally he snaps, taking an empty shotgun and goading police officers into opening fire on him.Spectacular Spider-Man #134-136. Marvel Comics. Carter is killed, though finally freed from the control of the Sin-Eater persona. The public revelation of the identity of the Sin-Eater as Stanley Carter by Peter Parker was responsible for the ruin of Eddie Brock's journalistic career, as Brock had published a series of articles on the Sin-Eater in The Daily Globe, based on his interviews with another man who claimed to be the Sin-Eater, Mr. Emil Gregg (\\"a compulsive confessor\\"). This led to Brock's hatred of Peter and eventually to his joining with the alien symbiote Venom.The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May, 1988). Marvel Comics. Kindred later resurrected Sin-Eater in his next plot against Spider- Man.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #37. Marvel Comics.

When the Lethal Legion (consisting of Count Nefaria, Grey Gargoyle, Living Laser, and Whirlwind) attacked Empire State University and fought Spider-Man, Sin-Eater crashed the battle. Upon using his special gun on Grey Gargoyle and Whirlwind, Sin-Eater copied Grey Gargoyle's powers and immobilized Spider-Man. Then he used his gun on Living Laser and Count Nefaria. When the Lethal Legion was at Ravencroft, Norah Winters interviewed Count Nefaria at the approval of Norman Osborn where she learned that they have suddenly regretted their sins. Due to Sin-Eater having taken away his powers, Overdrive was placed on life support as Carlie keeps on eye on him. Spider-Man wonders how Overdrive can be in critical condition while everyone else that Sin-Eater \\"cleansed\\" were sent to Ravencroft. Norah was later confronted in her car by Sin-Eater.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #46. Marvel Comics. Acting in self-defense, Norah shoots Sin-Eater point blank only for it to not harm him. Sin-Eater does allow her to record a manifesto. After showing it to J. Jonah Jameson who was apprehensive about it, Norah posts Sin- Eater's manifesto anyway. After cleansing some low-level criminals, Sin-Eater taunts Spider-Man again while overpowering him with the stolen powers while stating who his next target is. When a riot occurs at Ravencroft, Norman Osborn is informed by Count Nefaria that Sin-Eater is coming for him.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #47. Marvel Comics. Sin-Eater and his followers start purging those who have committed bad acts of their sins as Spider-Man learns that he is going after Norman Osborn.

Marvel Comics. =Supernatural Sin-Eater= During the \\"AXIS\\" storyline, a new and supernatural Sin-Eater emerges to terrorize New York City, gunning down members of the press. Carnage, whose morality had been altered by a spell cast by Doctor Doom and the Scarlet Witch, comes into conflict with the Sin-Eater when he stops him from murdering a reporter named Alice Gleason. The Sin-Eater later manages to track down and abduct Alice, taking her to his lair and implying that he is an undead Emil Gregg, the man who told Eddie Brock that he was the first Sin-Eater. Before the Sin-Eater can harm Alice, she is rescued by Carnage, who allows the Sin-Eater to absorb all of his repressed evil. Overwhelmed by Carnage's sins, the Sin-Eater grows to gigantic size and explodes as Carnage declares \\"Rest now, wandering soul. Your work is done\\". Empowered by the Grendel symbiote during the \\"Absolute Carnage\\" storyline, Cletus Kasady later resurrects Gregg as a zombie-like creature, which he lets loose in New York City. Donning a facsimile of the Sin-Eater costume, Gregg kidnaps several children with the intention of sacrificing them to the symbiote god Knull, but he is stopped and destroyed by Eddie Brock. Powers and abilities The first Sin-Eater had an artificially heightened physicality, similar to that of Captain America. Though his strength, agility, stamina and reflexes was greater than that of any Olympic athlete, it did not exceed the hypothetical natural limitations of the human body and would not be considered truly superhuman. The same clandestine experiments that heightened his physique probably also drove him insane. He had also undergone military training, though it was rendered less effective by his insanity. He is an expert hand-to-hand combatant and skilled marksman, with his signature weapon being a double-barreled shotgun. When revived by Kindred, Sin-Eater wielded a special gun that removed their powers and destroyed their sins. In addition, he can turn the sins into actual monsters, teleport, and absorb the powers of anyone he shoots. He has demonstrated making use of Overdrive's limited technopathy and vehicle alteration, Count Nefaria's ionic abilities, Grey Gargoyle's petrifying touch, Living Laser's laser projection, Whirlwind's rotation and wind-based abilities, Mister Negative's corruption touch, and Juggernaut's Cyttorak-based empowerment. The second Sin-Eater wielded a heavy assortment of guns, bombs, knives, and rocket launchers, and wore a bulletproof costume. The third Sin-Eater introduced claims of being able to detect the evil within others, and of absorbing a green energy which he claims is all of their sins after killing them. He is also unaffected by being repeatedly shot with a handgun, and regrows his own head (which is merely a skull) after it is destroyed by Carnage. Ghost Rider related fictional character biographies=Ethan Domblue= An earlier character named Sin- Eater first appeared in Ghost Rider #80. Ethan Domblue was a pastor obsessed with having a sinless congregation. Ghost Rider foe Centurious gave Ethan the power to \\"eat\\" his congregation's sins, leaving them in a passive, \\"sinless\\" state. He did not realize that by placing his parishioners' souls in the Crystal of Souls, he was creating an army of zombie-like slaves loyal to Centurious. Eventually, Ghost Rider defeated Centurious and freed the souls in the Crystal. As a last redemptive act, Ethan Domblue removed Zarathos from Johnny Blaze and placed the demon in the Crystal of Souls, freeing Blaze from the curse of Ghost Rider.Ghost Rider #80.

It is part of the municipality of Moalboal. The island derives its name from the Philippines' Spanish colonial heritage and the abundance of fish living on the surrounding coral reef, and the many fishermen that fish them (\\"pescador\\" translates from Spanish to \\"fisherman\\"). The rich marine life also attracts recreational divers from the many dive operations in nearby Panagsama. The underwater composition of the Pescador island reef is a sandy slope covered with soft coral from , followed by a wall covered with hard corals dropping down to about . On the west side of the island, an open-top underwater cave nicknamed 'the Cathedral' can be found. Most recreational dive tours start at the island's south end, and let the divers drift with the current either along the east or the west side of the island. Visibility conditions vary, but the current in the Ta√±on Strait pushes in clear water that often allows visibility up to . The island itself has a lighthouse and access steps on the north and east sides. View of the island, taken from Panagsama Beach The warm waters of the Philippines harbour a very rich marine life, with over 2,500 species of fish, and many of these are also found around Pescador island, contributing to the island being so popular with recreational divers. A rather more unusual part of the Pescador island biodiversity is the large school of sardines that have made the relative sanctuary of the reef its home. After an earthquake in February 2012, the school left the island, affecting the population of larger predatory fish. However, in May 2013 the school returned and so did the bigger fish. Sightings of sharks have also been reported. As Pescador Island is a marine park, dive shops are required to pay a fee for each diver they bring to the island. Proceeds from entrance fees are managed by the Municipality of Moalboal and Moalboal Dive Center Association (MDCA) towards the finance of a number of conservation programs in the municipality. These programs include patrols and enforcement to abolish destructive fishing, village improvement programs, collection and disposal of plastic and other wastes entering the local waters, marine conservation education of village children and adults, and reef and mangrove rehabilitation.

William Pitt, in the month of November, 1795 is a memorandum written by the Whig MP Edmund Burke to the Prime Minister of Great Britain William Pitt the Younger. It was published posthumously in 1800, along with an unfinished letter Burke was writing to the Secretary to the Board of Agriculture, Arthur Young. In the memorandum Burke claimed that it was not the government's responsibility to provide for the necessities of life and that labour is a commodity which will rise and fall according to the laws of supply and demand. Whenever people fall on hard times it should be left to private charity rather than state aid to alleviate their suffering. Burke further claimed that the laws of commerce were the laws of nature and therefore the laws of God. He accepted that there were exceptions to these rules and he set out what he believed should be the limits: > That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the > creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; > its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the > corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing > that is truly and properly public, to the public peace, to the public > safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity. Samuel Whitbread, a parliamentary ally of Burke's rival Charles James Fox, introduced a Bill on 9 December 1795 to enable magistrates to set minimum wages for agricultural labourers. Burke's letter to Young likely grew out of his opposition to this Bill.Robert Eccleshall, English Conservatism since the Restoration (London: Unwin Hyman, 1990), p. 75.

Retrieved on November 9, 2012. It was founded in 1963 and has existed on its current grounds since 1996. The school includes grades K-12 with a total student body of 1179 for the 2019‚Äì2020 school year. The high school is composed of 496 students, is a member of the Georgia High School Association, and competes in the A-Private classification in Region 5 . The school is named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, and all faculty are professed Christians from varying denominations. Students come from a variety of faith backgrounds.  History  Wesleyan School campus Wesleyan School was established in 1963 as an integral part of Sandy Springs United Methodist Church. Originally known as Wesleyan Day School, the school began as a preschool dedicated to providing a nurturing, educational experience guided by Christian principles. For the next 24 years, the school was housed at the church and grew to include elementary school. Wesleyan Day School added its middle school in 1987. In 1988, Barbara Adler, a former Wesleyan parent, teacher and assistant head, became Head of School, and during her tenure Wesleyan became an independent, Christian, college preparatory school, offering curriculum for kindergarten through 12th grade. In 1994, Wesleyan offered its first 9th grade class. With the addition of a high school, it was apparent that the school needed a new campus to continue its desired expansion. In the fall of 1994, a new corporation, Wesleyan School, Inc., was formed, and in the spring of 1995, a divestiture agreement from Sandy Springs United Methodist Church was finalized. After an extensive search for property by the new board, coupled with a generous land equity donation by Dan Cowart, a site in Peachtree Corners was put under contract in the fall of 1995. That fall, the board was faced with the challenge of naming a replacement for the retiring Adler. In the winter of 1996, after a deliberate and time-consuming search, the board hired Zach Young, a graduate of the University of Virginia and Harvard University and the former Vice President and Assistant Headmaster at The Westminster Schools. Under its new name and leadership, Wesleyan opened the 1996‚Äì97 school year with 556 students on its new campus. That year, the facilities consisted of 15 modular units, a soccer field, and the school's first permanent structure ‚Äì Marchman Gymnasium. In August 1997, Wesleyan added the high school building, Cleghorn Hall, which was named after long-time Atlanta educator, Wesleyan principal, and community leader, Gwen Michael Cleghorn. Under her leadership as a consultant and later as the first principal of the middle school and high school on the new campus, Wesleyan secured accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Another milestone of the 1997‚Äì1998 school year was the graduation of Wesleyan‚Äôs first senior class of 17 students. Thanks to the generous support of family members, foundations, and friends, Wesleyan added Hoover Student Activities Center in August 1998 school year, and its enrollment increased to more than 860 students. Other additions to the campus that year included Henderson Stadium and Robinson Field, which hosted the school's inaugural varsity football season. Modular units for a high school and middle school cafeteria were added, along with units for the music department. In the spring of 1999, the Curley Tennis Courts were dedicated, and a baseball field was added. Wesleyan School's \\"Raise the Goal Campaign\\" raised $45 million. The money from this campaign has been a milestone in the further development of the campus over recent years. In the fall of 2000, the school purchased of adjacent land. This new property adjoins the campus along Peachtree Parkway and is used for physical education, soccer, football, cross country, and lacrosse. 163 much-needed parking spaces for visitors and students were also added to the campus. Construction of Wesley Hall, the largest facility on campus, was completed in the fall of 2001. It houses the middle school as well as several high school classrooms. The building also contains a 465-seat theater, a dining hall for middle and high school students, a library for middle and high schools, a prayer chapel, science and computer labs, and office space. Directly in front of Wesley Hall is the Barbara F. Adler Plaza, a beautifully landscaped mall. The lower school building, Warren Hall, was completed during the summer of 2002. The building includes its own library, gymnasium, and a combination dining hall/auditorium. Specialty space includes classrooms for math, reading, religion, and French. A kitchen/laboratory space also acts as a math and science learning center. Warren Hall has its own covered carpool drop-off area and one large playground. During its 40th anniversary year, Wesleyan celebrated the completion of its most recent building, Davidson Natatorium. This building houses a twenty-five yard, ten- lane, competition high school pool; seating for 240; locker rooms; and concession areas. Wesleyan completed the \\"Raise the Goal Campaign\\" that raised over $45 million in December 2003. The final building campaign, and the first major endowment campaign, known as \\"Complete the Campus,\\" includes a fine arts center; a new performance gymnasium, the Don and Ida Yancey Gymnasium; and a new administration building. Also included is a goal of $10.4 million for endowment, the largest portion of which is designated for financial aid. The goal of this campaign is $42 million. Wesleyan School christened Gillfillan Hall administrative offices and announced the completion of the current Spalding Drive campus master plan at a ceremony on September 24, 2007. Gillfillan is adjacent to Marchman Gymnasium (the first permanent structure on campus) and houses the offices of the Headmaster, Development, Business, Communications and Admissions in its . The conclusion of campus construction is a significant achievement for the Peachtree Corners school, which moved from Sandy Springs in the fall of 1996, beginning the school year with fifteen modular units and one permanent structure ‚Äì Marchman Gym. With the completion of Gillfillan, the Wesleyan campus now has of permanent space under roof. Academics Wesleyan is a nurturing school for children from kindergarten until 12th grade. Class sizes are small, allowing for ideal learning. In the lower school, class sizes average 18, with two teachers in most classrooms. In the middle school and high school, class sizes average less than 15. The school features laptop integration, with each student from grades 5‚Äì12 receiving a personal computer, following a one-to-one plan. In the middle school, the students are divided by gender in math and English classes to accommodate for learning differences between boys and girls. 68% of teachers have advanced degrees.https://bbk12e1-cdn.myschoolcdn.com/ftpimages/995/misc/misc_146648.pdf At the high school level, Wesleyan boasts an extensive offering of AP classes, and in 2011 nearly 91% of students passed their AP exams.

Education Bohrod was born in Chicago in 1907, the son of an emigree Bessarabian-Jewish grocer. Bohrod studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art Students League of New York between 1926 and 1930. While at the Art Students League, Bohrod was influenced by John Sloan and chose themes that involved his own surroundings. Career He returned to Chicago in 1930 where he painted views of the city and its working class. He eventually earned Guggenheim Fellowships which permitted him to travel throughout the country, painting and recording the American scene. His early work won him widespread praise as an important social realist and regional painter and printmaker and his work was marketed through Associated American Artists in New York. Bohrod completed three commissioned murals for the Treasury Departments Section of Fine Arts in Illinois; Vandalia in 1935, Galesburg in 1938 and Clinton in 1939. During World War II, Bohrod worked as an artist; first in the Pacific for the United States Army Corps of Engineers' Army War Art Unit, then in Europe for Life magazine. In 1948, he accepted a position as artist in residence, succeeding John Steuart Curry, at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and remained in that capacity until 1973. In 1951, Bohrod was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1953. He died from liver cancer at his home in Madison, Wisconsin on 3 April 1992, at the age of 84. = Trompe-l'≈ìil = In the 1950s, Bohrod developed the trompe-l'≈ìil style of highly realistic, detailed still-life paintings which give an illusion of real life. It was this style with which he became internationally identified. Works Bohrod's America, its history Bohrod's works can be found in the collections of many American museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. The Aaron Bohrod Gallery at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìFox Valley was named in his honor. =Eulogy= \\"Plastic fish, rubber ducks, broken dolls, toy soldiers, souvenirs of every sort find their way into and fill the compositions of Aaron Bohrod. In doing so, the objects take on meanings far surpassing their original ones, taking on an importance never originally intended for them ... His works often take the form of visual jokes, riddles, or puns in which the artist has fun with the double meanings of commonly used words. Bohrod has a great sense of humor, but beneath it is a bite of the utmost seriousness‚Äîoften a criticism of the folly and silliness of mankind, his actions and concerns, as exhibited by the faster and faster pace of an ever twisting stream‚Äîthe spectacle of life.\\" Words of Everett Oehlshlaeger of Everett Oehlschlaeger Galleries Inc., Chicago.

Knoff is a former American football safety who played in the National Football League for the Denver Broncos, Houston Oilers and the Minnesota Vikings. A graduate of East Grand Forks Senior High School in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, Knoff was named the Minnesota High School Athlete of the Year in 1972. He attended the University of Kansas, excelling in football. He was a 1975 All-American, who also played both baseball and basketball for the Jayhawks. He was named to KU's All-Time Best Football Team by the Lawrence Journal-World. One incident associated with Kurt Knoff is a play he made known as \\"The Hit\\". In a game against Oklahoma State at Lawrence in '74 Knoff came from the defensive backfield running full speed. Alfred Nelms was also running full speed up the side-line as he had swept around the defensive line of KU and appeared headed for a touchdown, when suddenly Knoff bolted up the field and ran head on into Nelms causing them both to go unconscious. They both got up shortly after that and Knoff played out the remainder of the game. Selected in the 2nd Round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos, he did not sign with the team due to health concerns related to his knee. He eventually signed with the Houston Oilers, and played for the team in 1977 and 1978. He was picked up by the Minnesota Vikings during the 1979 season, and intercepted a pass on his very first play with the team. Knoff spent a total of four years with the Vikings, retiring before the start of the 1983 season.

One of the things that could go wrong would be people blaming us for things that people said on The Well. And the way I figured you get around that was to put the responsibility on the individual.

Save for No.s 27 to 29 the long sides are listed residential buildings in the mainstream, initial, protected category ‚Äì Grade II. Montagu Place runs along the north end; George Street along the south; both have a crossroads on the western side with Upper Montagu/Montagu Streets, each in turn one block away from retail/service premises fronted streets. Architecture It remains, as to minor, overarching interests, part of the Portman Estate. It was built between 1810 and 1815 along with Bryanston Square, a little to the west, and first leased to the builder David Porter. He named the square after his former mistress when he was a chimney sweep, Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu. John Summerson discounts the square as \\"a plain, uniform regiment of brown brick houses\\", comparing it unfavourably with Bryanston Square. The architect of both was Joseph T. Parkinson. Lower floors above ground level tend to have very long windows, reflecting the height of ceilings of these subtly mid rise buildings with elegant red stone dressings.

In this way they perform an analogous (similar) function to financial audits. There are generally two different types of environmental audits: compliance audits and management systems audits. Compliance audits tend to be the primary type in the US or within US-based multinationals. Environmental compliance audits As the name implies, these audits are intended to review the site's/company's legal compliance status in an operational context. Compliance audits generally begin with determining the applicable compliance requirements against which the operations will be assessed. This tends to include federal regulations, state regulations, permits and local ordinances/codes. In some cases, it may also include requirements within legal settlements. Compliance audits may be multimedia or programmatic. Multimedia audits involve identifying and auditing all environmental media (air, water, waste, etc.) that apply to the operation/company. Programmatic audits (which may also be called thematic or media-specific) are limited in scope to pre-identified regulatory areas, such as air. Audits are also focused on operational aspects of a company/site, rather than the contamination status of the real property. Assessments, studies. ISO 14001 ISO 14001BS EN ISO 14001: \\"Environmental management systems. Requirements with guidance for use\\" (2004) is a voluntary international standard for environmental management systems (\\"EMS\\"). ISO 14001:2004 provides the requirements for an EMS and ISO 14004BS EN ISO 14004: \\"Environmental management systems. General guidelines on principles, systems and support techniques\\" (2010) gives general EMS guidelines. An EMS meeting the requirements of ISO 14001:2004 is a management tool enabling an organization of any size or type to: # Identify and control the environmental impact of its activities, products or services; # Improve its environmental performance continually, and # Implement a systematic approach to setting environmental objectives and targets, to achieving these and to demonstrating that they have been achieved. Organizations implementing ISO 14001 usually seek to obtain certification by independent Certification Bodies. Certification indicates that the documentation, implementation and effectiveness of the EMS conform to the specific requirements of ISO 14001. This standard is currently being updated to include elements of including a lifecycle perspective and including top management amongst other changes. The draft (DIS) standard ISODIS 14001:2014 is currently the draft standard applicable until the ISO 14001:2015 standard is finalised and published. In 2002, the ISO organization also published ISO 19011, the standard for auditing quality and environmental management systems (ISO 19011:2002), which was used for internal audits and certification audits of EMS until it was updated in 2011.BS EN ISO 19011: \\"Guidelines for auditing management systems\\" (2011) The 2011 version on ISO 19011 restricts its use in first and second part audits, while third part audits (certification audits) are now covered in ISO/IEC 17021.BS EN ISO/IEC 17021: \\"Conformity assessment. Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems\\" (2011) A common misconception is that ISO 14001 certification automatically implies legal compliance. Certification under ISO 14001 does not directly reflect compliance with any legal requirements, although ISO 14001 demands the organization to evaluate its compliance with legal requirements. If there is no compliance with some legal requirement, ISO 14001 requires that the organization sets specific targets related to the non-compliance(s) and establishes, implements and maintains programmes to achieve compliance. Therefore it is possible that, at the time of audit, the organization fulfils the requirements of ISO 14001, yet there are one or more non-compliances with specific requirements, which are identified and which the organization actively works to correct. Specific guidance on this subject is provided by the European co-operation for Accreditation.EA-7/04: \\"Legal Compliance as a part of Accredited ISO 14001:2004 certification\\", European co-operation for Accreditation (2010). Audit tools and technology The term \\"protocol\\" means the checklist used by environmental auditors as the guide for conducting the audit activities. There is no standard protocol, either in form or content. Typically, companies develop their own protocols to meet their specific compliance requirements and management systems. Audit firms frequently develop general protocols that can be applied to a broad range of companies/operations. Current technology supports many versions of computer-based protocols that attempt to simplify the audit process by converting regulatory requirements into questions with \\"yes\\", \\"no\\" and \\"not applicable\\" check boxes. Many companies and auditors find these useful and there are several such protocol systems commercially available. Other auditors (typically those with many years of environmental auditing experience) use the regulations/permits directly as protocols. There is a long standing debate among environmental audit professionals on the value of large, highly detailed and prescriptive protocols (i.e., that can, in theory, be completed by an auditor with little or no technical experience) versus more flexible protocols that rely on the expertise and knowledge of experienced auditors and source documents (regulations, permits, etc.) directly. However usage of structured and prescriptive protocols in ISO 14001 audits allows easier review by other parties, either internal to the Certification Body (e.g. technical reviewers and certification managers) or external (accreditation bodies). In the US, permits for air emissions, wastewater discharges and other operational aspects, many times establish the primary legal compliance standards for companies. In these cases, auditing only to the regulations is inadequate. However, as these permits are site specific, standard protocols are not commercially available that reflect every permit condition for every company/site. Therefore, permit holders and the auditors they hire must identify the permit requirements and determine the most effective way to audit against those requirements. During the past 20 years, advances in technology have had major impacts on auditing. Laptop computers, portable printers, CD/DVDs, the internet, email and wireless internet access have all been used to improve audits, increase/improve auditor access to regulatory information and create audit reports on-site. At one point in the 1990s, one major company invested significant resources in testing \\"video audits\\" where the auditor (located at the corporate headquarters) used real-time video conferencing technology to direct staff at a site to carry live video cameras to specific areas of the plant. While initially promising, this technology/concept did not prove acceptable. An emerging technology in environmental auditing is the use of tablet computers. Related types of assessments Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (\\"ESA\\") are generally done in relation to mergers, acquisitions or financing activities. The intent of ESAs is to identify potential sources/existence of property contamination for purposes of clean up costs/liability under US law. ESA's rarely contain a compliance audit component and should not be confused with audits. Environmental auditing in India The Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) in India is headed by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India who is a constitutional authority. The CAG of India derives his mandate from Articles 148 to 151 of the Indian Constitution. The CAG‚Äôs (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 prescribes functions, duties and powers of the CAG. While fulfilling his constitutional obligations, the CAG examines various aspects of government expenditure and revenues. The audit conducted by CAG is broadly classified into Financial, Compliance and Performance Audit. Environmental audit by SAI India is conducted within the broad framework of compliance and performance audit.

The game is similar to the Australian handball rules people and the object is to keep the 'footbag' in the air by any means necessary, excluding hands. When someone fails to keep the footbag in the air, hit it with an upward trajectory, or the 'footbag' fails to make it to an opponents square, they are eliminated. Common rules Once the game is down to the final four competitors, the 'King' or server can opt to play semi finals, or 'Head to Head'. In this method of play, square 1 versus square 4 in a first to 3, while square 2 plays square 3. The winners of these match ups then play off in a Grand Final to determine the winner, which is also a first to 3 contest. In a first to 3 contest, the higher ranked player (e.g. King is higher than Dunce) serves. Similar to tennis, when a player wins a rally, they receive a point. Thus, first to 3 simply means, the first player to win 3 rallies. The other method of play when the game is down to the final four competitors is referred to a 'Normals' or 'Fatal Four Way'. When two of the people in the last four are eliminated, the Grand Final is played between the final two. These two competitors then play off in a first to 3 grand final. The game also operates on a two touch basis, where the competitors may only touch the 'footbag' a maximum of two times. For instance, the 'footbag' may come into contact with a competitor's chest, however the competitor still has one more chance to dispose of it to another competitor's square providing the 'footbag' doesn't make contact with the ground. Elimination wins Elimination wins are then tallied and the person with the most wins after a certain period of time is crowned 'champion'. One important rule when the elimination tally is taken into consideration, is that an elimination can not be held unless there is a minimum of 4 competitors.

First published in Putnam's Magazine in 1854, it consists of ten philosophical \\"Sketches\\" on the Encantadas, or Gal√°pagos Islands. It was collected in The Piazza Tales in 1856. The Encantadas was a success with the critics,Branch, Herman Melville, the Critical Heritage. p. 35. and contained some of Melville's \\"most memorable prose\\".Parker (1996), 202 Plot An anonymous narrator unites the ten disparate \\"Sketches\\", each of which begin with a few lines of poetry, mostly taken from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene. All of the stories are replete with symbolism reinforcing the cruelty of life on the Encantadas. \\"Sketch First\\" is a description of the islands; though they are the Enchanted Isles they are depicted as desolate and hellish. \\"Sketch Second\\" is a meditation on the narrator's encounter with ancient Gal√°pagos tortoises, while \\"Sketch Third\\" concerns the narrator's trip up the enormous tower called the Rock Rodondo. \\"Sketch Fourth\\" details the narrator's musings from atop the tower, and his recollection of the islands' accidental discovery by Juan Fern√°ndez.Fern√°ndez discovered the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands sometime after 1563, the date given in the story. \\"Sketch Fifth\\" describes the USS Essex' encounter with a phantom British ship near the area during the War of 1812. Sketches Sixth through Ninth tell stories of individual islands. \\"Sketch Sixth\\" describes Barrington Isle, once home to a group of buccaneers. \\"Sketch Seventh, Charles's Isle and the Dog-King\\" is about Charles's Isle, formerly the site of a colony governed by a soldier who had taken the island as his payment for his role in the Peruvian War of Independence. He maintained order through his group of vicious attack dogs, but was eventually banished by the colonists who fell to even greater levels of lawlessness. \\"Sketch Eighth, Norfolk Isle and the Chola Widow\\" is one of the most celebrated of the segments. In a manner similar to the rescue of Juana Maria, the \\"Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island\\" in California, who had been rescued only a year prior to The Encantadas' publication, the narrator describes how his ship had found a woman who had been living alone on Norfolk Isle for years. Hunilla, a \\"chola\\" (mestizo) from Payta, Peru, had come to the island with her newlywed husband and her brother to hunt tortoises; the French captain who dropped them off promised to return for them, but never did. One day, the husband and brother built a raft to go fishing, but hit a reef and drowned. Hunilla was utterly alone on the island until the narrator's ship arrived, except for one occasion in which she encountered whalers (what happened was so horrible that neither Hunilla nor the narrator would speak of it), and the sailors are so moved by her story that they return her to land and give her whatever money they can scrape up. The narrator last sees her riding to her hometown on the back of a donkey, an image strongly evoking Christ's ride into Jerusalem in John 12:12-20. \\"Sketch Ninth, Hood's Isle and the Hermit Oberlus\\" tells the story of Oberlus, a former sailor who takes up residence on Hood's Isle and eventually captures four men he makes his slaves. He murders passersby and takes their possessions until his behavior finally runs him afoul of the authorities. \\"Sketch Tenth, Runaways, Castaways, Solitaries, Gravestones, Etc.\\" is the narrator's description of the human aspects of life on the Encantadas and the relics left behind by former inhabitants.  Autobiographical elements  At the turn of 1840-1841, Melville signed up for a voyage aboard the whaler Acushnet. On October 30, 1841, the ship sighted Albemarle on the Gal√°pagos Islands. Around October 31, the Acushnet spoke with the Phenix of Nantucket. Events on or around this date furnished Melville with the basis for the visit to Rock Rodondo in Sketch Third.Parker (1996), 200-01 On November 2, the Acushnet and four other American whalers hunted the grounds around the Gal√°pagos Islands together; in Sketch Fourth Melville exaggerated the number of ships.Parker (1996), 201 The Composition Like all of the stories later included in The Piazza Tales, Melville wrote The Encantadas while in financial straits after the failure of his novels Moby-Dick and Pierre: or, The Ambiguities. Putnam's invited him to contribute material in 1852; he began to write, but never finished, a story on the abandoned wife Agatha Hatch Robertson that year,Melville described this story in a letter to his friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. See Billy Budd and Other Stories, pp. viii‚Äìix. and submitted his famous work \\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\" in 1853. In 1854 he contributed The Encantadas, which became the most critically successful of the Piazza Tales. The ten sketches of \\"The Encantadas\\" go back to Melville's whaling years, during which he visited the Galapagos Islands, supplemented with material from his reading in at least six books of Pacific voyages. According to the editors of The Piazza Tales, reliance on personal experience seems most prominent in the first four sketches, yet even here Melville drew upon \\"a number of other writers\\", though he only named William Cowley. Neither is the attribution at the end of the fifth sketch‚Äîwhere Cowley, Colnett, and Porter are mentioned‚Äîcomplete, for Melville borrowed from James Burney as well, probably from A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean, published from 1803 to 1817. Neither did he mention The Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin, which he used in the first sketch and possibly parodied in sketch four.Hayford, MacDougall, and Tanselle (1987), 603-04 In the fourth sketch Cowley's Voyage Round the Globe from 1699 is quoted.Hayford, MacDougall, and Tanselle (1987), 602 The basis for the fifth sketch is Journal of a Cruise Made to the Pacific Ocean by Captain David Porter, first published in 1815, which Melville had first used for Typee. This book \\"provided ore for at least a dozen passages\\", including the Oberlus story in the ninth sketch and the epitaph which concludes the tenth. In sketch six, Melville applied the brief description of James Island which he found in A Voyage to the South Atlantic and Round Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean by Captain James Colnett, published in 1798, to Barrington Isle.Hayford, MacDougall, and Tanselle (1987), 603 A month after the collection was published, Melville's old friend Richard Tobias Greene, on whom Toby in Typee was based, wrote him a letter expressing how the Encantadas sketches \\"had called up reminiscences of days gone by\\".Quoted in Robertson-Lorant (1996), 358  Publication history  The work was first published as \\"The Encantadas, or Enchanted Isles\\" under the pseudoniem \\"Salvator R. Tarnmoor,\\" in three installments in Putnam's Monthly Magazine for March, April, and May, 1854. Melville earned $50 for each installment.Hayford, MacDougall, and Tanselle (1987), 600-01. It appeared in The Piazza Tales published by Dix & Edwards in May 1856 in the United States and in June in Britain.Sealts (1987), 497. Neither that collection of short stories nor \\"The Encantadas\\" as a separate item were reprinted during Melville's lifetime.Hayford, MacDougall, and Tanselle (1987), 601  Reception  \\"The Encantadas\\" was one of the stories frequently singled out by reviewers of The Piazza Tales, mostly to compare the sketches to the author's first books. The New York Atlas found that the sketches were written in \\"the style of the author's first works\\", and praised the sketches because \\"a more vivid picture of the fire-and-barren-curst Gallipagos we have never read\\".Quoted in Sealts (1987), 506 For the Southern Literary Messenger the sketches were the product of the author's extraordinary imagination, which took the reader \\"into that 'wild, weird clime, out of space, out of time,' which is the scene of his earliest and most popular writings.\\" Commenting upon the original appearance in Putnam's Monthly Magazine, the New York Dispatch cited the chapters as \\"universally considered among the most interesting papers of that popular Magazine, and each successive chapter was read with avidity by thousands.\\" The reviewer called the sketches \\"a sort of mixture of 'Mardi' and 'Robinson Crusoe'--though far more interesting than the first named work.\\" Adaptations Kenneth Gaburo completed a one-act opera, The Widow, based on The Encantadas in 1961. Four years later, Portuguese director Carlos Vilardeb√≥ directed an adaptation in a Portuguese-French coproduction, starring Portuguese fado singer and actress Am√°lia as Hunilla (the film is essentially based on \\"Sketch Eight\\").As Ilhas Encantadas, 'Cinept - Cinema Portugues', Universidade da Beira Interior (Portuguese)As Ilhas Encantadas, IMDbA maldi√ß√£o das \\"Ilhas Encantadas\\", Jorge Mourinha, P√∫blico, 12 July 2011 In 1983, American composer, Tobias Picker wrote _The Encantadas_ for narrator and orchestra. The piece was given its world premiere that year by the Albany Symphony Orchestra and recorded on Virgin Classics by The Houston Symphony with John Gielgud as narrator. Each of the work's six movements evokes a different picture of life in the Galapagos Islands‚Äô equatorial wilderness. NotesReferences * Bergmann, Johannes D.

The angiopoietins are protein growth factors required for the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis). Angiopoietins The angiopoietins are protein growth factors that regulate angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels. In humans, three angiopoietins have been identified: Ang1, Ang2, and Ang4 (Ang 3 is the mouse ortholog of human Ang4). Ang1 and Ang4 function as agonistic or activating ligands for Tie2, whereas Ang2 and Ang3 behave as competitive antagonists. They function by binding their physiologic receptors, Tie-1 and Tie-2. These are receptor tyrosine kinases, so named because they mediate cell signals by inducing the phosphorylation of key tyrosines, thus initiating cell signalling. It is somewhat controversial which of the Tie receptors mediate functional signals downstream of Ang stimulation.

During World War I Hart served chairman of the Selective Service Appeals Board for Southwest Washington. Hart became governor when the then governor Ernest Lister retired in 1919 due to failing health. Hart was elected governor in his own right in 1920. Hart was instrumental in getting new road projects through the state legislature and strongly supported the creation of a state highway patrol. He oversaw the construction of a new State Capitol complex. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment was reorganizing the state's administrative structure, reducing the number of administrative agencies from 75 to 10. He did not have a Lieutenant Governor from his election as governor until William J. Coyle appointed to the office in 1921. He is the last governor of the state, to date, that did not have a Lieutenant Governor at any time during his governorship. Hart did not run for reelection in 1924, but instead retired to Tacoma where he practiced law, and served as the president of the State Good Roads Association. Death Hart died on 4 December 1929, in Tacoma, Washington. He is interred at Masonic Memorial Park, Tumwater, Washington. ReferencesFurther reading *Sobel, Robert, and Raimo, John (eds.)

PFE is a measure of counterparty risk/credit risk. It is calculated by evaluating existing trades done against the possible market prices in future during the lifetime of transactions. It can be called sensitivity of risk with respect to market prices. The calculated expected maximum exposure value is not to be confused with the maximum credit exposure possible. Instead, the maximum credit exposure indicated by the PFE analysis is an upper bound on a confidence interval for future credit exposure. Credit risk managers have traditionally remained focused on current exposure measurement (i.e., current mark-to-market exposure, plus outstanding receivables) and collateral management. The problem with this focus is that it places excessive emphasis on the present and fails to provide an acceptable indication of credit risk at some point in the future. Because losses from credit risk take a relatively long time to evolve, a more useful measure of exposure is potential exposure. Potential exposure is not like current exposure. It exists in the future and therefore represents a range or distribution of outcomes rather than a single point estimate. Relevance PFE is essential to bank regulation under Basel III and Dodd Frank. Fundamentally, to assess the safety of a bank's asset portfolio and the adequacy of its Tier 1 capital (and Tier 2 capital), one needs to evaluate whether it is resilient under severely stressing market moves. Because PFE is a measure of credit exposure, the most relevant stress move for PFE are not those where a large trading loss occurs (as they are when considering an institution's market risk). Instead, the scenarios of significant PFE can often be where the institution makes a large \\"paper\\" profit with a counterparty; and therefore accrues a large unsecured claim on that counterparty (a claim that the counterparty may be unable to pay). For example, a trader might buy cheap insurance contracts against a rare but catastrophic risk. The vast majority of the time ‚Äì and for many years running ‚Äì the trader will make a small annual loss (the CDS premium) even if the trade has positive expected value. When the rare event occurs, the trader may suddenly have a huge windfall \\"profit\\" claim against whoever wrote the \\"insurance\\". And this would mean a sudden increase in the relevance of whether or not the 'insurance writing' counterparty can actually pay. The possibility that the counterparty cannot pay (this huge new claim) would create a systematically important difference between the theoretical-credit-risk-free profits of the trader (and his institution) and his realized year end profit. Since institutional market risks are hedged, this difference could impact the institution's capital not merely as a failure to make excess profits, but actually as a significant net loss (due to losses on the offsetting hedge position). And potentially, exposure to such credit losses could make the \\"profit-making\\" trader's institution fail (and default on its own obligations to other companies) thereby causing other companies to suffer credit risk losses and fail (in the same way). The theoretical potential for a cascading series of institutional failures (caused by sudden rises in PFE) is apparent. The cost of avoiding or dealing with these risks can fall on the public (the vast majority of whom will not gain directly from the institutional profits made while accruing large PFE claims). This is for two main reasons. First, government directly (or indirectly) insures many retail deposits (to prevent bank runs and to promote savings), and many quasi-government agencies (e.g.: FNMA, Freddie Mac) have de facto government backing. Second, even when a major firm does not have government insured deposits, it can be \\"systemically important\\" (such as AIG) ‚Äì its failure would potentially cause panic, destroy market liquidity, and precipitate a crash and potential widespread economic contraction / depression. One plan that is intended to reduce the public cost (& private benefit) of the implicit support to \\"too big to fail\\" institutions is to reduce the variability and scale of PFE by incentivizing collateralization.  Expected exposure  The expected exposure (EE) is defined similarly to the PFE, except that the average is used instead of a specific quantile. The EE represents the estimated average loss at a specific future point of time that a lender would suffer from if the borrower (counterparty) fully defaults on his debt (i.e. if the loss given default (LGD) was 100%).

Murphy (born 1942) is a visual learning specialist and children‚Äôs book author. Murphy was born and raised in Rockville, Connecticut, and studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Before co-founding Ligature, a Chicago-based design firm that developed Social Studies, Reading, Science, and Math textbook programs for educational publishers with his business partner Richard Anderson in 1980, Murphy worked as Art Director at Ginn and Company, a Boston-based publisher. While at Ginn, he took a company- sponsored sabbatical to advise on art restorations in Venice, Italy in 1973-74. In 1995, the first three books in Murphy‚Äôs 63 book MathStart series were published by HarperCollins Children‚Äôs Books. MathStart books teach mathematical skills such as identifying patterns, skip counting and solving for unknowns through a combination of storytelling and visual learning strategies. The series is divided into 3 levels for children ages Pre-K through Grade 4. Taken separately, the 21 Level 1 books comprise one of the largest Pre-K math series available. The MathStart books have received many honors, including being named a Top Ten Nonfiction Series for Young Children by Booklist magazine, a publication of the American Library Association, in and awards from The Bank Street College of Education and The Oppenheim Toy Portfolio. Murphy‚Äôs story on negative numbers, Less Than Zero, was named a \\"Best Book of the Year\\" by AAAS Science Books & Films magazine. MathStart stories have been translated into Spanish, Korean, Arabic and Chinese and in 2013, sales topped 10 million books. The Main Street Kids‚Äô Club, an original musical based on six of the MathStart books, was workshopped at Northwestern University under the aegis of Rives Collins. Playwright and director Scott Ferguson , who also adapted and directed School House Rock Live! led the workshop, collaborating with composer Michael Mahler on music. Music Theatre International (MTI) coordinates licensing for regional theaters and school tours. Murphy‚Äôs second series, Stuart J. Murphy‚Äôs I See I Learn, focuses on Social, Emotional, Health and Safety and Cognitive skills for children in Pre-K and Grade 1. Published by Charlesbridge, the stories feature the students in Miss Cathy‚Äôs class at Ready Set Pre-K in See-and-Learn City. Visual learning strategies and a special section for parents and teachers called ‚ÄúA Closer Look‚Äù support the learning. Each book has been vetted by a team of early childhood experts. The series is also available as an educational program with teacher guides, videos and games through Pearson Education as I See I Learn at School. Murphy has been a featured speaker at several educational conferences including NCTM, NCSM, IRA, NAEYC and NHSA. He also served on the executive committee for the Advisory Council to the Arts in Education Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and is an Honorary Trustee of the Rhode Island School of Design after serving 19 years on the Board. Murphy lives with his wife Nancy in Boston, Massachusetts and Prota, Italy. They have two children and three grandchildren. The elder two have MathStart books named after them (Jack the Builder and Mighty Maddie), while the youngest, Camille, provided the inspiration for her namesake character in the I See I Learn books.

DOBU produces paresthesia and difficulty sleeping, but with few other effects. Compared to shorter chain homologues such as DOM, DOET and DOPR which are all potent hallucinogens, DOBU has an even stronger 5-HT2 binding affinity but fails to substitute for hallucinogens in animals or produce hallucinogenic effects in humans, suggesting it has low efficacy and is thus an antagonist or weak partial agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor. Isomers Alternative isomers of DOBU can also be produced, where the 4-(n-butyl) group of DOBU is replaced with any of the three other butyl isomers, the iso-butyl, sec-butyl and tert- butyl compounds being called DOIB, DOSB and DOTB respectively.

Activities include boating, fishing, and swimming on the Michael J. Kirwan Reservoir, hiking, and camping. History In early days, Native Americans and some early settlers used the Mahoning River as a source for salt. Captain John Campbell who led militia in the War of 1812 opened the oldest brick land office building around 1810. Before the reservoir was made, the building was moved out of the area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the Michael J. Kirwan Reservoir in 1965. The reservoir was developed for recreation, water supply, flood control, and fish and wildlife management. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers then leased the land to the state of Ohio to be used as a state park. West Branch State Park was officially opened in 1966.

It embraces drugs (both brand name and generic), biologics (products derived from living sources, as opposed to chemical compositions), vaccines and natural health products. Pharmaceutical policy includes: Funding of research in the life sciences In many countries, an agency of the national government (in the U.S. the NIH, in the U.K. the MRC, and in India the DST) funds university researchers to study the causes of disease, which in some cases leads to the development of discoveries which can be transferred to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies as a basis for drug development. By setting its budget, its research priorities and making decisions about which researchers to fund, there can be a significant impact on the rate of new drug development and on the disease areas in which new drugs are developed. For example, a major investment by the NIH into research on HIV in the 1980s certainly could be viewed as an important foundation for the many antiviral drugs that have subsequently been developed.Aggarwal, Rashmi, Kaur, Rajinder, Patent Law and Intellectual Property in the Medical Field. IGI Global, Jun 30, 2017 p67-73 Patent law While patent laws are written to apply to all inventions, whether mechanical, pharmaceutical, or electronic, the interpretations of patent law made by government patent granting agencies (the United States Patent and Trademark Office, for example) and courts, can be very subject-matter specific with significant impact on the incentives for drug development and the availability of lower-priced generic drugs. For example, a recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Pfizer v. Apotex, 480 F.3d 1348 (Fed.Cir.2007), held invalid a patent on the \\"pharmaceutical salt\\" formulation of a previously patented active ingredient. If that decision is not overturned by the United States Supreme Court, generic versions of the drug in controversy, Norvasc (amlodipine besylate) will be available much earlier. If the reasoning of the Federal Circuit in the case is applied more generally to other patents on pharmaceutical formulations, it would have a significant impact in speeding generic drug availability (and, conversely, some negative impact on the incentives and funding for the research and development of new drugs).Janice M. Mueller. Mueller on Patent Law: Patentability and Validity. Wolters Kluwer Law & Business, 2012  Licensing  This involves the approval of a product for sale in a jurisdiction. Typically a national agency such as the US Food and Drug Administration (specifically, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER), the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency or Health Canada or Ukrainian Drug Registration Agency is responsible for reviewing a product and approving it for sale. The regulatory process typically focuses on quality, safety and efficacy. To be approved for sale a product must demonstrate that it is generally safe (or has a favourable risk/benefit profile relative to the condition it is intended to treat), that it does what the manufacturer claims and that it is produced to high standards. Internal staff and expert advisory committees review products. Once approved, a product is given an approval letter or issued with a notice of compliance, indicating that it may now be sold in the jurisdiction. In some cases, such approvals may have conditions attached, requiring, for example additional 'post-marketing' trials to clarify an issue (such as efficacy in certain patient populations or interactions with other products) or criteria limiting the product to certain uses.  Pricing  In many jurisdictions drug prices are regulated. For example, in the UK the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme is intended to ensure that the National Health Service is able to purchase drugs at \\"reasonable prices\\". In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board examines drug pricing, compares the proposed Canadian price to that of seven other countries and determines if a price is \\"excessive\\" or not. In these circumstances, drug manufacturers must submit a proposed price to the appropriate regulatory agency.Jackson, Emily. Law and the regulation of medicines. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012. p161-170  Reimbursement  Once a regulatory agency has determined the clinical benefit and safety of a product and pricing has been confirmed (if necessary), a drug manufacturer will typically submit it for evaluation by a payer of some sort. Payers may be private insurance plans, governments (through the provision of benefits plans to insured populations or specialized entities like Cancer Care Ontario, which funds in-hospital oncology drugs) or health care organizations such as hospitals. At this point the critical issue is cost-effectiveness. This is where the discipline of pharmaco-economics is often applied. This is a specialized field of health economics that looks at the cost/benefit of a product in terms of quality of life, alternative treatments (drug and non- drug) and cost reduction or avoidance in other parts of the health care system (for example, a drug may reduce the need for a surgical intervention, thereby saving money). Structures like the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canada's Common Drug Review evaluate products in this way. Some jurisdictions do not, however, evaluate products for cost- effectiveness. In some instances, individual drug benefit plans (or their administrators) may also evaluate products. Additionally, hospitals may have their own review committees (often called a Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T;) committee) to make decisions about which drugs to fund from the hospital budget. Drug plan administrators may also apply their own pricing rules outside of that set by national pricing agencies. For example, British Columbia uses a pricing model called reference-based pricing to set the price of drugs in certain classes. Many US pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) use strategies like tiered formularies and preferred listings to encourage competition and downward pricing pressure, resulting in lower prices for benefits plans. Competitive procurement of this sort is common among large purchasers such as the US Veteran's Health Administration. Typically, a manufacturer will provide an estimate of the projected use of a drug as well as the expected fiscal impact on a drug plan's budget. If necessary, a drug plan may negotiate a risk-sharing agreement to mitigate the potential for an unexpectedly large budget impact due to incorrect assumptions and projections. Because the clinical trials used to generate information to support drug licensing are limited in scope and duration, drug plans may request ongoing post-market trials (often called Phase IV or pragmatic clinical trials) to demonstrate a product's 'real world safety and effectiveness.' These may take the form of a patient registry or other means of data collection and analysis. Once a product is deemed cost-effective, a price negotiated (or applied in the case of a pricing model) and any risk-sharing agreement negotiated, the drug is placed on a drug list or formulary. Prescribers may choose drugs on the list for their patients, subject to any conditions or patient criteria.Vogenberg, F. Randy, ed. Understanding Pharmacy Reimbursement. Ashp, 2006.  Formulary management  At the core of most reimbursement regimes is the drug list, or formulary. Managing this list can involve many different approaches. Negative lists ‚Äì products that are not reimbursed under any circumstances are used in some jurisdictions (c.f. Germany). More dynamic formularies may have graduated listings such as Ontario's recent conditional listing model. As mentioned, formularies may be used to drive choice to lower cost drugs by structuring a sliding scale of co-payments favouring cheaper products or those for which there is a preferential agreement with the manufacturer. This is the principle underlying preferred drug lists used in many US state Medicaid programs. Some jurisdictions and plans (such as Italy) may also categorize drugs according to their 'essentialness' and determine the level of reimbursement the plan will provide and the portion that the patient is expected to pay. Formularies may also segment drugs into categories for which a prior authorization is needed. This is usually done to limit the use of a high cost drug or one that has potential for inappropriate use (sometimes called 'off-label' as it involves using a product to treat conditions other than those for which its license was granted). In this circumstance a health care provider would have to seek permission to prescribe the product or the pharmacist would have to obtain permission prior to dispensing it.Angus, Douglas E., and Heather M. Karpetz. \\"Pharmaceutical policies in Canada.\\" Pharmacoeconomics 14, no. 1 (1998): 81-96.  Eligibility  Depending on the structure of the health care system, drugs may be purchased by patients themselves, a health care organization on behalf of patients or an insurance plan (public or private). Hospitals typically limit eligibility to their in- patients. Private plans may be employer-sponsored such as Blue Cross, mandated by legislation, as in Quebec or consist of an outsourcing arrangement for a public plan, such as the US Medicare Part D scheme. Public plans may be structured in a variety of ways including: #Universal, as in Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme #Restricted by age, as in the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan for seniors #Segmented by disease group, such as Manitoba's cystic fibrosis drug plan #Geared to income, such as US Medicaid programs in many states Additionally, plans may be structured to respond to the 'catastrophic' impact of drug expenses incurred by those with serious diseases or high drug spending relative to income. These patient populations, often called 'medically needy,' may have all or part of their drug costs covered by 'plans of last resort,' (typically government-sponsored). One such plan is Ontario's Trillium Drug Program. Pharmaceutical policy may also be used to respond to health crises. For example, Argentina launched REMEDIAR during its financial crisis of 2002. The government-sponsored program provides a specified list of essential drugs to primary care clinics in low-income neighbourhoods. Similarly, Brazil provides drugs for HIV/AIDS free to all citizens as a deliberate public health policy choice. Eligibility policy also focuses on cost-sharing between a plan and the beneficiary (the insured person). Co-payments may be used to drive certain prescribing choices (for example, favouring generic over brand drugs or preferred over non-preferred products). Deductibles may be used as part of geared to income plans.Angus, Douglas E., and Heather M. Karpetz. \\"Pharmaceutical policies in Canada.\\" Pharmacoeconomics 14, no. 1 (1998): 81-96.  Prescribing  Pharmaceutical policy may also attempt to shape and inform prescribing. Prescribing may be limited to physicians or include certain classes of health care providers such as nurse practitioners and pharmacists. There may be limitations placed on each class of provider. This may take the form of prescribing criteria for a drug, limiting its prescribing to a particular type of specialist physician for example (such as HIV/AIDS drugs to physicians with advanced training in this area), or it may involve special drug lists that a specific type of health care provider (such as a nurse practitioner) may prescribe from.Hattingh, Laetitia, John S. Low, and Kim Forrester. Australian pharmacy law and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2013. p219 Plans may also seek to influence prescribing by providing information to prescribers. This practice is often called 'academic detailing' to differentiate it from the detailing (provision of drug information) done by pharmaceutical companies. Organizations such as Australia's National Prescribing Service typify this technique, providing independent information, including head-to-head comparisons and cost-effectiveness information to prescribers to influence their choices.Hattingh, Laetitia, John S. Low, and Kim Forrester. Australian pharmacy law and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2013. p27, 67 Additionally, efforts to promote the 'appropriate use' of medications may also involve other providers like pharmacists providing clinical consulting services. In settings such as hospitals and long-term care, pharmacists often collaborate closely with physicians to ensure optimal prescribing choices are made. In some jurisdictions, such as Australia, pharmacists are compensated for providing medication reviews for patients outside of acute or long-term care settings. Pharmacist collaboration with family physicians in order to improve prescribing may also be funded.Hattingh, Laetitia, John S. Low, and Kim Forrester. Australian pharmacy law and practice. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2013. p27-30  Pharmacy services  Pharmaceutical policy may also encompass how drugs are provided to beneficiaries. This includes the mechanics of drug distribution and dispensing as well as the funding of such services. For example, some HMOs in the US use a 'central fill' approach where all prescriptions are packaged and shipped from a central location instead of at a community pharmacy. In other jurisdictions, retail pharmacies are compensated for dispensing drugs to eligible beneficiaries. A state-operated approach may also be taken, as with Sweden's Apoteket, which had the monopoly on retail pharmacy until 2009, and was not-for-profit. Pharmaceutical policy may also subsidize smaller, more marginal pharmacies, using the rationale that they are needed health care providers. The UK's Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme works this way.Aspalter, Christian, Yasuo Uchida, and Robin Gauld, eds. Health Care Systems in Europe and Asia.

Biography Born in Cape Coast then known as (Gold Coast) and named Kweku, he was said to be the son of Birempong Cudjo. In 1754, Kweku was one of three Fante children taken to England for education by a missionary from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. Of the three children, Thomas Cobbers died in 1758, while William Cudjoe suffered a mental breakdown and died in 1766. Kweku fared better. The two brothers were baptised at St Mary's Church, Islington on 7 January 1759, which they had attended for four years. Kweku took the name Philip. In London, he studied theology at the University of Oxford and in 1765 was ordained in the Church of England. Phillip Quaque was the first African to be ordained as a minister of the Church of England. The same year, he married Catherine Blunt, an English woman, and the two returned to Cape Coast the following year. The Royal African Company employed Quaque as the chaplain at Cape Coast Castle. He set up a small school in his own house, \\"especially for the training of Mulatto children who were growing in large numbers\\",\\"Philip Quaque (Born 1741-Died 1816) As a pioneer missionary\\", in Magnus J. Sampson, Gold Coast Men of Affairs (Past and Present), with an Introduction by J. B. Danquah, London: Dawsons of Pall Mall, 1937; 1969 reprint, pp. 194-202. and attempted to work as a missionary, but having forgotten most of his native tongue, Fante, he was unable to make any conversions and experienced difficulty connecting with the natives. He married twice more, these times to African women, and in 1784 sent his two children for education in London.  Letters  Quaque wrote a series of letters to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, London from 1765 to 1811 telling of his successes, trials, and hardships during his time at Cape Coast Castle. These letters also depict a colorful and insightful image of life on the West African coast during his time there, such as the workings African politics and territorial and trade relations. He tells of a number of things including the large number of deaths of Europeans shortly after their arrival, including the death of his first wife in 1766. Most of his letters speak mainly of his baptisms, paying special attention to those that included ‚Äúothers,‚Äù or non-mulatto children. Though his school was initially ‚Äúfor the instruction of mulatto children only of both sexes,‚Äù Quaque did eventually begin taking in African children. This did not, however, negate his disapproval of many aspects of their (and technically his) culture, including their language (which he used to speak), their religion, and their communalist practices. Through his letters, particularly the one dated 1767, we get a thorough sense of the difficulty of Quaque's job as a missionary and how it conflicted with the traditionally polytheistic society he was living in. Also very telling through his letters is the influence of the endeavors of European nations to gain control, or at least an advantage, along the coast. In his letter dated July 30, 1775, he mentions the resulting bloodshed of a conflict, which he later mediated, between the local Dutch allies and his own townspeople. Such conflicts, as well as competition with the slave trade and the American Revolution, play a large role in the number of factors behind Quaque's supposedly limited success. Yet for these reasons, many grant Quaque glory for the number of baptisms he was able to perform, as well as the fact that he consistently stayed in touch with the Society over the course of several decades, even into his state of illness, despite the London headquarters only sending him 3 letters in response during his entire time stationed there. Quaque received much criticism from both sides. In one of his letters he speaks of the harsh discrimination by Africans towards Europeans, and expresses that he himself even experiences it, regardless of his African descent. On the European side, he was criticized for becoming too involved in the coastal society, largely in part due to his marriages to local women, and the interpretation of his letters to not have been dissociated from his own culture.African Travellers of the Eighteenth Century [sic].

It lies west of the Federal District (Distrito Federal) near the municipality of Metepec, in the central part of the state of M√©xico, and is part of the Toluca urban area bordering the city to the east. The name Atenco is derived from the Nahuatl language. It means ‚ÄúIn the water‚Äôs edge‚Äù, from atl(water), tentli (edge) and co (in). The city Enormous mammoth fossils have been found near the Lerma River, where San Mateo Atenco is today. The first settlers used mammoth fossils as tools for hunting. This area has been the scene of the development of cultural groups that transited through the Toluca Valley for 20 thousand years. During the pre-Classic period (2000 B.C.), agricultural development created small settlements. During the Classic period (250-900 A.C.), the settlements had cultural relations with Teotihuac√°n. Atenco was founded by the Matlazincas (Men of the net). Matlazincas were a militarist society and dominated the Toluca Valley during the period from 750 to 1162. The pre-Hispanic town was founded by Xolotl, the lord of Texcoco in the 12th century. After the Spanish Conquest, Atenco was governed by Juan Altamirano who was the governor of the Marquise of Toluca.

His shiur has gained much popularity in its short existence, and is currently one of the most popular shiurim in the Yeshiva. Some credit this popularity to his ability to blend the teaching styles of his two teachers, Rabbi Mordechai Willig and Rabbi Hershel Schachter. Rabbi Willig is known for his focus towards practical understanding and Rabbi Schachter is known for his ability to present topics in the Talmud in a broader context. Rabbi Sobolofsky blends these two styles to form a unique package that many students find most rewarding.

Education and legal career Carnes received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Alabama in 1972. He received his Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1975. After law school, he accepted a position as an assistant state attorney general for the state of Alabama, where he served from 1975 to 1992. From 1981 to 1992 he served as the Chief of the Capital Punishment and Post- Conviction Litigation Division of the Alabama State Attorney General's Office. As the head of Alabama capital punishment unit, Carnes became, according to the National Law Journal, \\"the premier death penalty advocate in the country and a chief adviser on capital punishment to judges, the U.S. Justice Department and other prosecutors.\\"\\"Judge Blasts High Court on Death Penalty Appeals,\\" Mobile Register, May 19, 1994. Carnes re-wrote Alabama's death penalty statute,Richard Lacayo, \\"To the Bench Via the Chair: A Major Confirmation Fight is Brewing Over the Replacement of a Federal Judge Who Was a Civil Rights Hero,\\" Time, Sept. 14, 1992. and defended its use before the Supreme Court of the United States on three occasions, including Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625. Carnes's ascendancy to the bench created a hole in the capital punishment unit, leading an Alabama appellate judge to lament that the state had lost a \\"very effective voice in support of executions in this state.\\"\\"Newsmakers: Edward E. Carnes,\\" The National Law Journal, Dec. 28, 1994.  Federal judicial service  Carnes was nominated by President George H. W. Bush on January 27, 1992 for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to a seat vacated by Judge Frank Minis Johnson. To Carnes' opponents, he was a poor choice to succeed Judge Johnson, a hero of the civil rights movement who had declared that the segregated buses of Montgomery, Alabama were illegal.\\"A Legacy Dishonored,\\" San Jose Mercury News, Sept. 15, 1992. Some compared replacing Johnson with Carnes to Bush's earlier decision to replace Thurgood Marshall with Clarence Thomas. Nonetheless, his nomination might have sailed through the Senate if not for the Rodney King incident, which encouraged Senate Democrats to use Carnes' nomination as a chance to stump against racism in the criminal justice system. Critics blasted Carnes for defending Alabama prosecutors accused of systematically excluding blacks from death penalty trial juries.\\"1992: Year of Unexpected,\\" Mobile Register, Dec. 27, 1992. Carnes' supporters responded that as a prosecutor, Carnes had engaged in a campaign to eliminate racial discrimination in jury selection even before the Supreme Court had become involved in the issue.\\"Victory Over Smears,\\" Memphis Commercial Appeal, Sept. 15, 1992. They noted that when selected by the judges of the state to prosecute judicial misconduct, Carnes had sought sanctions against sixteen sitting judges, including two who were removed from the bench for racist remarks. He also sought a venue change to a county with a higher black population for the retrial of a twice-convicted black defendant accused of brutally murdering a white victim. Prominent southern civil rights lawyers were split over the nomination. Stephen Bright, Director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, testified against the nomination and lambasted the Senate's decision to confirm Carnes to the bench.David Pace, \\"Senate's Approval of Judge Attacked: Civil Rights Groups Criticize Edward Carnes After Confirmation Vote,\\" Akron Beacon Journal, Sept. 10, 1992.

Lewis, ‚ÄúSenate Accepts Carnes; A Judicial Confirmation Continues Tilt to the Right,‚Äù New York Times, Sept. 13, 1992. After eight months and a Democratic filibuster, Carnes was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 9, 1992 by a vote of 62‚Äì36. He received his commission the following day. He assumed office on October 2, 1992, and served as Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit from August 1, 2013 to June 2, 2020. He assumed senior status on June 30, 2020.  Writing style  Carnes has a folksy yet precise writing style, often engaging in wordplay and the use of literary allusions. He has been described as \\"one of the more talented writers on the federal appellate bench.\\"See http://howappealing.law.com/0207.html Carnes' wry humor sometimes earns comparisons to former Judge Alex Kozinski on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\\"http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=The%20Ten%20Commandments%20Judge; Judge Blasts High Court on Death Penalty Appeals,\\" Mobile Register, May 19, 1994. Another comparison has been to former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who, like Carnes, regularly used allusions and metaphors, often to justify deference to the legislature. Carnes occasionally gives speeches on effective writing and on metaphors in the law, including to Harvard Law School 1L students on April 5, 2013, Emory Law School students on November 2, 2011, University of Georgia Law School 1L students on January 28, 2010, and University of Alabama School of Law 1L students on an annual basis.

Compared to many petiolaris sundews, it has wide petioles, which are densely covered in silvery hairs. It usually forms rosettes 8 cm across, although plants up to 20 cm in diameter have been reported.Lowrie, Allen (1998); Carnivorous Plants of Australia, Volume III; University of Western Australia Press. Description D. ordensis flower A perennial rosette-forming herb, D. ordensis forms clumps of stemless or nearly stemless rosettes. Each plant has numerous leaves, which as typical for the subgenus consist of a long, hairy petiole supporting a nearly round lamina. The lamina is densely studded with stalked mucilaginous glands, which serve to attract and trap arthropod prey, which is subsequently digested and absorbed by the plant as a source of nutrients. During the dry season, the plant produces smaller, somewhat dormant leaves which are protected by their dense covering of silvery hairs. Drosera ordensis flowers from December through April. Flowers form on a crowded raceme, opening singly. The five-petaled flowers can be pink to nearly white and are about 1.5 cm in diameter. Distribution and habitat Drosera ordensis inhabits sandy soils near sandstone outcrops in the northeast tip of Western Australia near Kununurra and Pago and in the neighbouring region of the Northern Territory in Keep River National Park. The plant is often associated with Sorghum species.

The film stars Al Jolson and was a follow-up to his previous film, The Singing Fool (1928). Plot Joe Lane, radio entertainer and songwriter, learns that the manager of the studio, Arthur Phillips, has made improper advances to his wife, Katherine. Infuriated, Lane engages him in a fight, and the encounter results in Phillips' accidental death. Joe goes to prison and soon insists that Katherine divorce him, for her and their son's sake, and marry her employer, Dr. Merrill, since Joe has learned the doctor has feelings for Katherine and would provide for them well. When Joe is released he visits his son, Little Pal, at school and they embrace during outdoor recess. Joe says goodbye when recess is over, but Little Pal follows Joe downtown and is soon struck by a truck, causing the paralysis of his legs and loss of his voice. Joe takes the boy to Dr. Merrill, who long ago proposed to Katherine, but she had politely declined and told the doctor that she still loved Joe. Dr. Merrill says he will either operate for free if Joe relinquishes Little Pal to his mother's care or charge a large fee if Joe insists on keeping the boy to himself. Joe panics and leaves with the boy, but soon realizes his mistake and brings Little Pal back for the surgery. After obtaining Joe's promise that he will return Little Pal to his mother, Merrill operates and restores the use of the boy's legs. Little Pal's voice is regained later when Katherine plays a recording by Joe, \\"Little Pal\\", at his bedtime and Little Pal dreams of a tender visit with his father holding him in his arms and singing to him. Joe returns to work, singing and also sending personal messages over the airwaves to his wife, who, along with their son, await Joe at their lovely home.

This, Jolson's third feature film, contains several firsts in his movie career: His first full length talkie (unlike his previous two efforts which were Part- Talkies with long sections of an essential silent picture ‚Äì with a synchronized score and sound effects added ‚Äì in addition to talking and singing sequences); his first to not present him singing a song in black-face; and the first Al Jolson movie to flop at the box office. It was also one of the few films in his career in which his on-screen character isn't named Al, and the second and last to cast him as a married man. Reception Reviews from critics were mostly negative. Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote that in \\"later episodes it lapses into sentimentality that makes it somewhat tedious, except for the singing of Mr. Jolson. Even the lines in some of Mr. Jolson's songs detract from their value, for his tuneful exhortation to a group of convicts is by no means inspiring.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker called it long and \\"blatantly sentimental\\", adding, \\"Even the fantastically happy ending, when the sound of his voice cures the child of aphasia, does not eradicate the general impression of dreary and specious tragedy.\\" \\"Story mawkish and over sentimental\\", agreed Film Daily. \\"It can't miss and yet, as a picture, Jolson's latest is indifferent stuff.\\" Variety ran a positive review, calling the film \\"a marked advancement for [Jolson] as a screen player...He plays more naturally and looks the human Al Jolson on the screen, even in the betterment of his make up, than previously.\\" Although word of mouth did not travel fast enough to completely sink the film at the box office, its $1.7 million gross in the United States was considered a flop by Jolson's standards. It was received so badly in Los Angeles that the Warners Theatre closed it after only forty-eight hours. According to Warner Bros records it earned $1,715,000 domestically and $551,000 foreign. Preservation states About ten minutes of film have been lost.

After being sold to the Star Stations group in 1959, KVAN relaunched as Top 40 station KISN, which was at times Portland's most listened-to station in the 1960s. A scandal involving political bias and a litany of indiscretions resulted in the FCC revoking the licenses of all five Star Stations, including KISN, in 1975; the stations left the air September 2, 1976. =New licenses= After the FCC revoked the KISN license, four applications were received for the vacated frequency, from Rose Broadcasting, Viking Vancouver, Fort Vancouver Broadcasting and Longwood Broadcasting; the agency designated these applications for comparative hearing on July 12, 1978. The applicants merged in 1979 under the Fort Vancouver Broadcasting application, enabling the FCC to issue a construction permit. The new station took the call letters KKSN‚Äîthe KISN calls having been assigned to 97.1 FM in Salt Lake City, Utah, on May 8, 1978‚Äî and began broadcasting April 1, 1980, trading on the \\"Mighty 91\\" name and KISN heritage. Former KISN sales manager Bill Failing served as the first general manager of the new KKSN. In its history since returning in 1980, this frequency has aired numerous formats, including classical, oldies (as \\"Kissin' 910 from 1987 to 1989) and adult standards (as \\"Sunny 910\\" from 1989 to 1998). On March 30, 1998, as part of a format swap, the \\"Sunny\\" format would move to 1520 AM, while 910 became home of sports radio station KFXX, which would move to 1080 kHz on March 18, 2004. 910 then adopted 1080's former hot talk format as KOTK (\\"Max 910\\"). Personalities on \\"Max\\" included Don Imus, Rick Emerson, Don & Mike, Tom Leykis and Phil Hendrie. On April 21, 2005, it flipped back to oldies as KKSN, picking up the oldies format after KKSN-FM 97.1 (\\"KISN-FM\\") flipped to adult hits as \\"Charlie FM\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-04-29.pdf On February 15, 2007, KKSN changed their call letters to KTRO; and on March 28, 2007, KTRO-FM changed their format to regional Mexican and changed their call letters to KRYP, and the existing talk format continued on KTRO AM. The station is owned by Entercom but was programmed by Salem Communications. The former program lineup (Dennis Prager, Hugh Hewitt, Laura Ingraham, etc.) was similar to that found on other Salem stations throughout the United States. On January 5, 2009, the station switched to a simulcast of KWJJ, an FM country music station. The LMA with Salem Communications expired. On May 1, 2009, KTRO switched to ESPN Deportes Radio, a Spanish-language sports talk network. On May 28, 2010, KTRO changed their call letters back to KKSN. The station dropped ESPN Deportes Radio on July 12, 2010 in favor of simulcasting the programming of KNRK-HD2, which airs music from local bands. On September 11, 2013, KKSN changed its call letters to KMTT as part of a warehousing move by Entercom. The former holder of the call letters, 103.7 FM in Seattle, now uses the call letters KHTP. On November 1, 2013, KMTT changed their format from \\"94/7 too\\" with local and Northwest music (which continues on KNRK-HD2) to sports, branded as \\"Sports 910\\" with programming from CBS Sports Radio.Entercom Launches Sports 910 Portland On September 10, 2015 KMTT switched affiliations from CBS Sports Radio to ESPN Radio and rebranded as \\"910 ESPN Portland\\".Entercom Shakes Up Portland Sports Stations ReferencesExternal links Category:Radio stations established in 1980 MTT Category:1980 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Entercom radio stations ","title":"KMTT"},{"id":"10338696","text":"Rabai Road, Jericho, Nairobi Jericho (Pronunciation: -'jer-i-\\"kO) is an estate in Nairobi, Kenya just east of the Nairobi Province. It is a constituent of Makadara Constituency. Ofafa Jericho and Jericho Lumumba are located in the Eastlands suburbs of Nairobi , neighbouring, Makadara,Buru Buru, Harambee, Uhuru, Maringo and Jerusalem Estates.  Housing  After Kenya‚Äôs independence, Jericho was formed as a settlement specifically for the African working class. It was built with help from the Israeli government. Jericho houses are currently owned by the Nairobi City County, which is led by a Governor. All of the homes are the same shape and size. They are double storied houses with one tenant living on the ground floor and another on the top floor. Most of the area‚Äôs companies use the outside of these houses as advertising space and in return they paint the inside of the home for the resident(s). Most of these houses are occupied by young men who have inherited the homes from their parents who have either relocated to the rural areas or died. Due to lack of constant income, many home owners rent rooms within the houses for profit. The tenants pay an average of 2,500 to 3,000 KShs (Kenyan shilling) for their occupancy.  Society and culture  The Jericho area is occupied by almost all tribes in Kenya. The primary language of its inhabitants is called (Sheng) which is a mixture of English, Swahili and various vernacular languages. The average age of Jericho inhabitants is 35 years. The children of these residents attend city council schools which paid for by the government. With respect to healthcare, with the increase in healthcare education and services to this city, the prevalence of health concerns like HIV/AIDS and infant mortality has dropped significantly.  Business and economy  The average pay for a Jeri resident is around 20,000 shillings and they use approximately 100 shillings daily for food in a day. Employment in Jericho centers around cottage industries, short contracts in the transport business, and FMCG vending. Some of the residents are mid-tire working class citizens but most also self-employed in small-medium enterprises. The youth of Jericho have also started various youth ventures such as garbage collection and car mechanical repairs.  Notable people from Jericho  Jericho was home to the late Kisoi Munyao, the man who hoisted the Kenyan Flag on Mt. Kenya on 12 December 1963 during independence day. It was also home to the late,Robert Wangila the late Bildad Kaggia, Mzee Teacher (Karate legend). Robert Napunyi Wangila is still the only Kenyan Olympic boxing gold medalist even 22 years after his death. He was a celebrated Kenyan boxer who won gold medal in 1988 summer Olympic games. He was born and raised in Jericho estate in Nairobi. and many others.. It was the home of Barack Obama, Sr., a senior economist in the Kenyan Ministry of Finance, his first wife, and their children. Obama is the father of United States President Barack Obama by his second wife. Jericho is known to be the home of many famous Kenyan football players. The main football field in Jericho, otherwise known as \\"TOYOYO STADIUM\\" has produced many players that have gone on to play in the Kenyan national team (Harambee Stars) and also professionally in Europe. Most notable among these are John \\"Shoto\\" Lukoye, Benard \\"Zico\\" Otieno, Jacob \\"Ghost\\" Mulee, George Olubendi among others.

Shapiro in 1951 when considering the magnitude of specific trigonometric sums. In signal processing, the Shapiro polynomials have good autocorrelation properties and their values on the unit circle are small. The first few members of the sequence are: : \\\\begin{align} P_1(x) & {} =1 + x \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_2(x) & {} =1 + x + x^2 - x^3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_3(x) & {} =1 + x + x^2 - x^3 + x^4 + x^5 - x^6 + x^7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ ... \\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_1(x) & {} =1 - x \\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_2(x) & {} =1 + x - x^2 + x^3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ Q_3(x) & {} =1 + x + x^2 - x^3 - x^4 - x^5 + x^6 - x^7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ ... \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} where the second sequence, indicated by Q, is said to be complementary to the first sequence, indicated by P. Construction The Shapiro polynomials Pn(z) may be constructed from the Golay‚ÄìRudin‚ÄìShapiro sequence an, which equals 1 if the number of pairs of consecutive ones in the binary expansion of n is even, and ‚àí1 otherwise. Thus a0 = 1, a1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = ‚àí1, etc. The first Shapiro Pn(z) is the partial sum of order 2n ‚àí 1 (where n = 0, 1, 2, ...) of the power series :f(z) := a0 \\\\+ a1 z + a2 z2 \\\\+ ... The Golay‚ÄìRudin‚ÄìShapiro sequence {an} has a fractal-like structure - for example, an = a2n - which implies that the subsequence (a0, a2, a4, ...) replicates the original sequence {an}. This in turn leads to remarkable functional equations satisfied by f(z). The second or complementary Shapiro polynomials Qn(z) may be defined in terms of this sequence, or by the relation Qn(z) = (1-)nz2n-1Pn(-1/z), or by the recursions :P_0(z)=1; ~~ Q_0(z) = 1 ; :P_{n+1}(z) = P_n(z) + z^{2^n} Q_n(z) ; :Q_{n+1}(z) = P_n(z) - z^{2^n} Q_n(z) . Properties Zeroes of the polynomial of degree 255 The sequence of complementary polynomials Qn corresponding to the Pn is uniquely characterized by the following properties: * (i) Qn is of degree 2n ‚àí 1; * (ii) the coefficients of Qn are all 1 or ‚àí1, and its constant term equals 1; and * (iii) the identity Pn(z)2 \\\\+ Qn(z)2 = 2(n + 1) holds on the unit circle, where the complex variable z has absolute value one. The most interesting property of the {Pn} is that the absolute value of Pn(z) is bounded on the unit circle by the square root of 2(n + 1), which is on the order of the L2 norm of Pn. Polynomials with coefficients from the set {‚àí1, 1} whose maximum modulus on the unit circle is close to their mean modulus are useful for various applications in communication theory (e.g., antenna design and data compression). Property (iii) shows that (P, Q) form a Golay pair. These polynomials have further properties: : P_{n+1}(z) = P_n(z^2) + z P_n(-z^2) ; \\\\, : Q_{n+1}(z) = Q_n(z^2) + z Q_n(-z^2) ; \\\\, :P_n(z) P_n(1/z) + Q_n(z) Q_n(1/z) = 2^{n+1} ; \\\\, :P_{n+k+1}(z) = P_n(z)P_k(z^{2^{n+1}}) + z^{2^n}Q_n(z)P_k(-z^{2^{n+1}}) ; \\\\, :P_n(1) = 2^{\\\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\\\rfloor}; {~}{~} P_n(-1) = (1+(-1)^n)2^{\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor - 1} . \\\\, See also * Littlewood polynomials NotesReferences * Chapter 4. * Category:Fourier analysis Category:Digital signal processing Category:Polynomials ","title":"Shapiro polynomials"},{"id":"10338714","text":"Calvary Schools of Holland (CSH) is a private Christian school located in Holland, Michigan.

History=1877‚Äì1914= William Y. Fleming and Peter Ferguson (1840‚Äì1911) founded the company in Paisley, Scotland in 1877, making marine steam engines. In 1885 they expanded into shipbuilding by taking over the business and Phoenix Shipyard of H. McIntyre & Co. Fleming and Ferguson became a private company in 1895 and a public limited company in 1898. In 1903 the Ferguson family withdrew from the business and set up their own shipyard, Ferguson Shipbuilders, at Port Glasgow. However, Fleming and Ferguson survived their departure and developed a World-class reputation for reciprocating engines and small ships. In 1889 Fleming and Ferguson built the cargo ship with quadruple-expansion engines. By 1894 Fleming and Ferguson were also making water-tube boilers, which were featured in an article in The Engineer. The firm also built reciprocating engines for non-marine use. In 1904 it supplied two inverted triple-expansion engines for a water company in Brighton. In the 1890s the company entered the specialist market for \\"knock down\\" vessels. These were bolted together at the shipyard, all the parts marked with numbers, disassembled into many hundreds of parts and transported in kit form for final reassembly with rivets. This elaborate method of construction was used to provide inland vessels for export. In 1898 it built the stern wheel paddle steamer and exported it in sections for reassembly at Maryborough, Queensland in Australia. The firms main specialisms were vessels such as dredgers, barges, tugboats, floating cranes, lighthouse tenders and, in 1904, the icebreaker . Occasionally it also built steam yachts. In peacetime it also took one Admiralty order, the minelayer built in 1901 for service in New Zealand. In 1914 it had a workforce of 1,000. =First World War= In the First World War it built the s and (both 1917) and ; s and (both 1917), , and (both 1918) and and several Strath-class naval trawlers.

In 1964 the American Marine and Machinery Co. Inc. bought Fleming and Ferguson. The company's final ship was a dredger that it built speculatively. Fleming and Ferguson ceased trading before completing the vessel so Hugh Maclean of Renfrew completed her. The dredger, yard number 804, was eventually named Bled and exported to Yugoslavia. Floating crane Hikitia in Wellington, New Zealand Surviving ships Surviving Fleming and Ferguson products include the floating steam cranes Hikitia and Rapaki (both 1926) and dredger (1929), all in New Zealand; dredger (1961) (now called UCO 1 and registered in Bahrain) and research vessel Andusandhani (1963) on the Hooghly River in West Bengal.

It is based on a partial juvenile skeleton once thought to belong to Thecodontosaurus. Only one valid species of Pantydraco is recognised: P. caducus.  Description  Pantydraco was of moderate build. The creature had a long tail that tapered towards the end and was broad at the hip joint. It had a pointed head with a strong jaw. The forelimbs of the dinosaur were developed for grasping while the hindlimbs were adapted for supporting the creature's body weight. The center of mass lies near the pelvic bone, meaning the creature was bipedal. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs. The hands had three movable digits while the fourth digit was embedded. It had well-developed claws. The juvenile fossils‚Äô estimated height is from about long. Adults are believed to have been about long. The estimated weight for an average adult of this species of dinosaurs is about . Thus, the creature was fairly gracile. The teeth were well developed. Discovery and naming In 2003, Adam Yates named the new species Thecodontosaurus caducus for a skull and a skull, a partial jawbone, and vertebrae of the cervix, an incomplete right pelvic bone, and partial forelimbs of an immature sauropodomorph. This material had been known in the scientific literature since 1984, and had been used to represent the genus Thecodontosaurus. However, changed understanding of the relationships and characteristics of basal sauropodomorphs (also known as prosauropods) has led Peter Galton, Yates, and D. Kermack to give T. caducus its own genus. The genus was named after the Pant-y-ffynnon quarry where it was discovered. Pantydraco takes its name from the \\"pant\\" of Pant-y-ffynnon quarry, meaning a dry valley and \\"draco\\" (a dragon or mythical dragon-like creature in Latin). This is because the quarry is located near Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, in Southern Wales, at the base of a mountain between two rivers. The species epithet, caducus, means \\"fallen\\" in Latin, referring to the assumption that it fell into a fissure fill (quarry) and died there. Paleobiology Pantydraco is considered to have most probably been omnivorous, being at the transition from carnivory to herbivory in the sauropodomorph lineage. It is probable that Pantydraco would have walked bipedally. Paleoecology The Pant-y-ffynnon region was a characteristic wetland during the Triassic. The area consists of alluvial silts deposited by the rivers and sand and limestone. The climate ranges from arid to semi-humid.

The pace of the bout was unpopular with the crowd of 15,000 as both boxers moved slowly using caution and careful ringcraft in their defense. Nichol's trusty left had little snap against the effective blocking of Firpo. Nichols, the aggressor, led for the first seven rounds. The pace increased in the final three heats with Nichols breaking the close margin in the tenth which he won handily.\\"Nichols Outpoints Henry Firpo in Ten Rounds\\", The Oil City Derrick, Oil City, Pennsylvania, pg. 11, 25 March 1930 Tiger Thomas lost to Nichols on July 25, 1930 in a close but controversial six round decision. The referee gave Thomas four of the six rounds for his aggressive two armed technique, though both judges scored for Nichols who clearly led in the early rounds. The crowd of 3000 booed the ruling, believing the bout belonged to Thomas, the local boxer.

Williams may have lost the favor of the judges as a result of his defensive posture through much of the bout. Nichols used his powerful left in the fourth and sixth to bring his opponent close to a knockout but Nichols weathered the attack exhibiting endurance and a skilled elusive strategy. In the middle of the forth, Nichols staggered his opponent with a left to the face that nearly led to a knockout, but for the sounding of the bell. Williams finally went down for a no count at the start of the fifth. One reporter gave Williams only the fifth, with seven rounds to Nichols and two even.\\"Georgy Nichols Decisively Outpoints Sunny Jim Williams\\", The Oil City Derrick, Oil City, Pennsylvania, pg. 11, 12 November 1930 Nichols gained an easy victory over Charley Belanger, the Light Heavy Champion of Canada, on December 3, 1930 at the Broadway Auditorium in Buffalo, New York.

In the enthralling clash of middleweights, Nichols stung his rival with his powerful left but Laravee fought back stronger than before. After being floored in the eighth, Laravee fought back with a two fisted barrage that thwarted Nichol's attempts at a knockout. Nichols appeared to have a slight edge in seven of the ten rounds.\\"Nichols Triumphs Over Leo Larivee\\", The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 17, 14 July 1931 Nichols won a decisive newspaper decision against powerful puncher Chuck Burns on October 1, 1931 at Esmund Athletic Field in Sandusky, Ohio. One reporter gave eight rounds to Nichols, one round for Burns and one round a draw. Nichols entered the ring with bruised and swollen hands that apparently affected his ability to deliver a knockout punch or even knock his opponent to the mat. Nichols displayed his characteristic strong left and right jab and remained the aggressor through much of the bout. Burns opened up in the tenth to take the round by a slight edge.\\"Sanduskan Took Eight Rounds Against Opponent\\", The Sandusky Register, Sandusky, Ohio, pg. 10, 2 October 1931 Nichols had defeated Burns earlier in December of 1930 in Buffalo, New York.

Wright, however, showed determination in avoiding a knockdown, even in the heated tenth round where he fended off Nichol's lefts to the face and body.

Nichols scored a technical knockout over Petrin one minute into the fifth round of eight in Chicago, though he had taken considerable punishment in the early rounds. A terrific left hook to the chin of Petrin landed him on the mat for a count of nine. Nichols then closed the bout with rights and lefts nearly knocking his opponent out of the ring. The referee called the bout with Petrin hanging over the ropes, and unable to mount a defense.Lane, French, \\"Jones Beats Johnson; Olin, Calmes Win Tourney\\", Chicago Tribune, pg. 15, 31 December 1931Terrific left hook in \\"Johnson Loses to Billy Jones\\", Detroit Free Press, Detroit, Michigan, pg. 12, 31 December 1931 In the third round of the NBA tournament, on January 15, 1932, Nichols defeated Charley Bellanger in a ten round points decision.

Nichols began to pile up a points margin in the second round when he scored with a left to Scozza's jaw. In the semi-final round of the NBA tournament on February 18, 1932, before a crowd of 23,000, Billy Jones fell to Nichols in a ten round points decision. Many in the large crowd were there to see Jack Dempsey fight Kingfish Levinsky in a preliminary exhibition. Nichols's win stunned many ringside as Jones was favored to reach the final bout and take the championship. An enthralled audience watched him down his opponent twice in the second round, once for a count of nine, and once for a count of two. He downed Jones again in the fourth for a long count of nine. Nichols was only down briefly in the fifth. Though his opponent finished strong in the final rounds, Nichols had amassed too large a points margin and won the decision. \\"Nichols Defeats Jones\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 13, 19 February 1932Decision was upset in \\"Former Champion Unable to Master Fish Peddler\\", The Richmond Item, Richmond, Indiana, pg. 12, 19 Feb 1932 =Taking the NBA World Light Heavyweight title= Nichols took the NBA Light Heavyweight title in a shocking upset against fellow Southpaw Dave Maier in a close decision on March 18, 1932 in Chicago. The match was the deciding round in the NBA Light Heavyweight championship elimination tournament. Nichols, who had previously lost to Maier, was a 100-1 underdog in the early betting. Outpunching and outboxing his opponent, Nichols fought back ferociously any time he was cornered. He scored well in the fourth with lefts to the head and jaw, knocking Maier sagging into a corner, and turning the tide of contest.\\"Sandusky Boy Shows Real Class;Soundly Beats Heavier Foe\\", The Sandusky Register, Sandusky, Ohio, pg. 8, 19 March 1932Kirksey, George, \\"George Nichols Wins Light Heavy Title\\", St. Louis Star and Times, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 8, 19 March 1932 Nichols won a fifth round technical knockout against Red Fitzsimmons, of Wichita in Colorado Springs on July 22, 1932.\\"Fights\\", Dixon Evening Telegraph, Dixon, Illinois, pg. 7, 23 July 1932 Nichols dropped a ten round points decision to Ham Jenkins on July 29, 1932 in Denver.

Nichols appeared to take the second through fifth, while the remaining rounds fell to Gainer by a considerable margin. Nichols was down four times in the bout.\\"Al Gainer Awarded Decision Over Nichols\\", Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut, pg. 13, 16 May 1933. He would lose again to Gainer on April 20, 1936 in an eighth round technical knockout in Pittsburgh. The referee halted the bout between the eighth and ninth rounds due to cuts on Nichol's forehead and over his right eye. Nichols had been down for a nine count from a left hook to the jaw in the seventh. Though Gainer was a formidable opponent, Nichols seemed unwilling to take the lead in the bout, and clinched frequently in defense.Biederman, Lester, \\"Gainer vs. Lewis?\\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 27, 21 April 1936 On June 12, 1933, Nichols faced Frankie O'Brien in a ten round points decision in Hartford. The going was slow in the first seven rounds from Nichols careful defense, though the pace roused jeers of derision from the crowd. Nichols was credited with five rounds, and O'Brien three.

Nichols may have lost the decision for fading in the final rounds, and not appearing to take the lead in the fighting. Nichol's defensive posture allowed Slaughter to scored frequently with straight lefts to the head and rights to the body.\\"Slaughter on Floor Five Times But Is Victor\\", Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, pg. 26, 7 July 1933 On July 17, 1933, Nichols lost to Norman Conrad in a ten round points decision in Bedford, New Hampshire.

Though stripped of the title, Nichols fought on, finding a number of quality opponents. Allen Matthews fell to Nichols on July 8, 1936 before 10,000 fans in a ten round points decision in Chicago. Matthews skillfully landed a blow over Nichols left eye in the opening round, but may have ultimately had difficulty adjusting to his opponent's Southpaw style. Matthews was down for a no count from a blow to the face in the fifth. In a strong finish, Nichols floored Matthews with a left to the jaw for a count of nine in the ninth.\\"George Nichols Punches Out Victory Over Allen Matthews\\", The Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware, pg. 14, 9 July 1936\\"Nichols Whips Negro Fighter\\", The News Messenger, Freemont, Ohio, pg. 8, 9 July 1936Down in the ninth in \\"Nichols Makes Strong Finish in Outpointing Local Fighter\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 16, 9 July 1936 Before a sizable crowd of 10,000, Nichols lost a non-title ten round decision against John Henry Lewis, reigning Light Heavyweight Champion, at Municipal Auditorium in St. Louis, Missouri on August 12, 1936.

Nicknamed \\"Wild Bill\\" because of his lack of control on the mound‚Äîhe twice led the National League in bases on balls‚ÄîHallahan nevertheless was one of the pitching stars of the 1931 World Series and pitched his finest in postseason competition. Hallahan also was the starting pitcher for the National League in the first All-Star Game in 1933, losing a 4‚Äì2 decision to Lefty Gomez of the American League and surrendering a third-inning home run to Babe Ruth in the process. Early years in baseball Hallahan, a native of Binghamton, New York, spent most of his career in the employ of the St. Louis Cardinals. He signed with their nearby AA farm club, the Syracuse Stars of the International League, in 1924. The following season, he made his first NL appearance for the Redbirds, appearing in six games. In 1926, Hallahan pitched in 19 games for the Cardinals during the regular season, and made a first, brief World Series appearance that fall against the New York Yankees. But Hallahan was not yet ready for an extended Major League career. He spent 1927 with Syracuse, winning 19 games and leading the International League in strikeouts (195) and walks (135). The next season, he won 23 games for the Houston Buffaloes and led the Texas League in strikeouts (244). Finally, in 1929, he rejoined the Cardinals for good. Stalwart World Series hurler Hallahan became a starting pitcher in 1930, winning 15 games for the pennant-winning Cardinals and leading the NL in strikeouts (177) and walks (126). In the 1930 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics, Hallahan split two decisions but he shut out the powerful A's in Game 3 and allowed only two earned runs in 11 innings, for a sparkling ERA of 1.64. Philadelphia won the Series in six games, the only World Series Hallahan's Cardinals would ever lose. In 1931, Hallahan again led the NL in strikeouts (159) and walks (112) and won 19 games, as St. Louis again took the league championship for a rematch against the Athletics. This time, Hallahan was even more effective. He shut out the A's again in Game 2, pitched a complete game 5‚Äì1 victory in Game 5, and nailed down the decisive Game 7 in relief by getting the last out in the ninth inning. All together, he gave up only 12 hits and one run in innings ‚Äî an ERA of 0.36 ‚Äî as St. Louis triumphed in seven games. Hallahan's dominance is even more impressive because the A's featured a predominantly right-handed-hitting lineup, including fearsome sluggers Jimmie Foxx and Al Simmons. After two more winning campaigns for non-contending Cardinal clubs, Hallahan won only eight games, losing 12, for the 1934 edition. But the Gashouse Gang won the National League title and gave Hallahan one more chance to experience the big stage. In Game 2 of the 1934 World Series, against the Detroit Tigers, Hallahan started against Detroit ace Schoolboy Rowe and left with one out in the eighth inning of a 2‚Äì2 tie. Detroit won the game in the ninth, 3‚Äì2, but overall the Cardinals again prevailed in seven games. All together, in seven World Series games and 39 innings, Hallahan won three games, lost one with an earned-run average of 1.36‚Äîstill, in 2014, one of the ten lowest (and best) ERAs ever recorded by a pitcher in the postseason (which now includes divisional and championship series playoffs). Hallahan stayed with the Cardinals until May 31, 1936, when he was sold to the Cincinnati Reds, then a second-division team. His career statistics suffered with the Reds and his final club, the cellar-dwelling Philadelphia Phillies. Over his last two seasons, 1937‚Äì38, Hallahan won four and lost 17 games. Hallahan finished with a regular-season record of 102 victories and 94 defeats, 856 strikeouts and 779 walks, and an ERA of 4.03 in innings pitched.  Life after baseball  After retiring from baseball, Hallahan worked as a supervisor for General Aniline and Film Co. (now GAF) in Johnson City, New York. He lived on Davis Street on the West Side of Binghamton, where he led a very quiet life. He was a local legend to the young kids in that neighborhood who frequently begged him to show them his World Series watches and rings. He always obliged. Wild Bill would attend Little League games at nearby Recreation Park to cheer on the neighborhood kids. The field there is dedicated in his honor. Hallahan died at age 78 in Binghamton, New York.

An early proponent of the San Francisco Civic Center, he also designed hotels, factories and mausoleums like the Columbarium of San Francisco. His Butterfly World Map, like Buckminster Fuller's later Dymaxion map of 1943 and 1954, enabled all continents to be uninterrupted, and with reasonable fidelity to a globe. Cahill demonstrated this principle by also inventing a rubber-ball globe which could be flattened under a pane of glass in the \\"butterfly\\" form, then return to its ball shape. A variant was developed by Gene Keyes in 1975, the Cahill‚ÄìKeyes projection.

Keith and Thomson are Elmer Keith and R.W. \\"Bob\\" Thomson. The 338-378 Keith-Thomson Magnum is a quarter of an inch shorter than the full length 338-378 Weatherby Magnum, this was because they thought it was better balanced with the slowest powder generally available at that time (H4831). The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum was added to the Weatherby product line in 1998. The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum's parent case is the .378 Weatherby Magnum. The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum is created by necking down the .378 Weatherby Magnum to 8.59 mm (.338 in) then fire forming it in the rifle chamber. The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum has a case capacity of about 8.1 g (125 gr). Bullets commercially available for the .338-378 Weatherby Magnum range from: 11.7 g (180 gr) to 19.4 g (300 gr) in the construction of; boat-tail hollow-point; boat-tail pointed soft; pointed soft point; heavy jacketed pointed soft point; partition; multi-core; truncated solid and monolithic solid. The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum's main appeal is long-range shooting. A Weatherby factory cartridge loaded with a 16.2 g (250 gr) hunting bullet, in a rifle with a 71 cm (28 in) barrel will yield a muzzle velocity of 933 m/s (3060 ft/s) and muzzle energy of 7046 J (5197 ft¬∑lbf). This same bullet will carry a down range velocity to 457 m (500 yd) of 648 m/s (2125 ft/s) and energy of 3391 J (2501 ft ¬∑ lbf). A hand loaded .338-378 Weatherby Magnum used for 1000 yd target shooting loaded with a 19.4 g (300 gr) boat-tail hollow point from a rifle with a 71 cm (28 in) target barrel will yield a muzzle velocity of 917 m/s (3010 ft/s), at 914 m (1000 yd) will carry a down range velocity of 590 m/s (1936 ft/s) and at 1372 m (1500 yd) will still be carrying a supersonic down range velocity of 462 m/s (1517 ft/s). The .338-378 Weatherby Magnum is appropriate for hunting all game animals on the North American, European and Asian continents. In Africa the 338-378 Weatherby Magnum is appropriate for taking medium and large game. The free recoil of the 338-378 Weatherby Magnum from a (11 lb) rifle (including magazine rounds, scope, base and rings) is 73 J (54 ft ¬∑ lbf) as compared to an average 27 J (20 ft ¬∑ lbf) from a rifle chambered for .30-06 Springfield. The Finnish .338 Lapua Magnum (.338 LM) cartridge introduced in 1989, the American .338 Remington Ultra Magnum (.338 RUM) cartridge introduced in 2000 and the Swedish .338 Norma Magnum (.338 NM) cartridge introduced in 2008 are probably the closest currently (2018) commercially available ballistic twins of the .338-378 Weatherby Magnum. The .338 Lapua Magnum is however a rimless cartridge, the .338 Remington Ultra Magnum is a rebated rim cartridge while the .338 Norma Magnum is a rimless cartridge.

The film starred Al Jolson and was a follow-up to his previous film, Say It with Songs (1929). Mammy became Al Jolson's fourth feature, following earlier screen efforts as The Jazz Singer (1927), The Singing Fool (1928) and Say It with Songs (1929). The film relives Jolson's early years as a minstrel man. The songs were written by Irving Berlin, who is also credited with the original story titled Mr. Bones. Plot Lois Moran and Al Jolson in Mammy The story deals with the joys and tribulations of a travelling minstrel troupe known as the Merry Meadow Minstrels. Al Jolson plays as a blackface endman while Lowell Sherman plays as the interlocutor. Hobart Bosworth plays as the owner of the show, while his daughter, played by Lois Moran, serves as Al Jolson's love interest in the picture. Sherman's character, however, is also in love with Moran's. The show is in a miserable state until Jolson entertains a sheriff and manages to convince him to invest in the show. The show becomes very successful thanks to this investment and Jolson is eventually able to visit his mother. Some time after he returns, he tells Moran that he loves her and this causes Sherman to become jealous. After a heated argument between Jolson and Sherman over Moran, a character played by Mitchell Lewis, who is upset because he was caught cheating at cards, puts real bullets in Jolson's stage gun. Since Jolson pretends to shoot Sherman in the minstrel show act, Lewis knows that this will result in Sherman's death and that Jolson will be blamed for the murder. After Sherman is shot, Jolson is arrested but manages to escape and take a freight train out of town. Eventually, Lewis confesses to the crime and Jolson is thereby proven to be innocent.

This print was restored by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and released on DVD from the Warner Archive Collection, along with its Overture and Exit Music. Unfortunately, sections of those Technicolor sequences were lost when Dutch titles were inserted, and some of the cuts from color to sepia tinted black and white are not smooth.

It operated four lines: the Second Avenue Line, Third Avenue Line, Sixth Avenue Line, and Ninth Avenue Line.  History = 19th century = By the late 1870s, the elevated railways in Manhattan were operated by two companies - the Metropolitan Elevated Railway (Sixth Avenue) and New York Elevated Railroad (Third and Ninth Avenues). The Metropolitan also began constructing a line above Second Avenue. The Manhattan Railway was chartered on December 29, 1875, and leased both companies on May 20, 1879. From 1881 the Third Avenue Line and the Sixth Avenue Line were in service 24/7https://www.loc.gov/item/98688705/. The Suburban Rapid Transit Company, operating the Third Avenue Line in the Bronx, was leased on June 4, 1891; all three companies were eventually merged into the Manhattan Railway in February 1890.McGraw Electric Railway Manual: The Red Book of American Street Railways Investments, 1902, p. 186 Richard Croker, boss of Tammany Hall, was in the newspapers in 1899 after a disagreement with Jay Gould's son, George Gould, president of the Manhattan Elevated Railroad Company, when Gould refused Croker's attempt to attach compressed-air pipes to the Elevated company's structures. Croker owned many shares of the New York Auto-Truck Company, a company which would have benefited from the arrangement. In response to the refusal, Croker used Tammany influence to create new city laws requiring drip pans under structures in Manhattan at every street crossing and the requirement that the railroad run trains every five minutes with a $100 violation for every instance. = 20th century = The Interborough Rapid Transit Company, incorporated in April 1902 as the operating company for its first subway line, signed a 999-year lease on the Manhattan Railway Company lines on April 1, 1903, over a year before the subway opened.James Blaine Walker, Fifty Years of Rapid Transit, 1864-1917, published 1918, pp. 182-186 Finally, after 60 or more years of service, and after having operated under a series of companies and jurisdictions, mainly the IRT, the successor to the Manhattan Railway, the elevated lines began to disappear, with the first line closing in 1938, and the final section closing in 1973: * service on the Sixth Avenue Line ended in 1938. * the Ninth Avenue Line south of 155th Street was closed in 1940, while the section from 155th Street north into the Bronx was continued as the \\"Polo Grounds Shuttle\\" until 1958. * the final section of the Second Avenue Line closed in 1942. * service on the Manhattan section of the Third Avenue Line was phased out in the early 1950s and ended in 1955, while the service on the Bronx section terminated in 1973.

History Bada Bagh panorama A descendant of Maharawal Jaisal Singh, the founder of Jaisalmer State, Jai Singh II (1688‚Äì1743), commissioned a dam to create a water tank during his reign in the early 18th century. This made the desert green in this area. After Jai Singh II's death on 21 September 1743, his son Lunkaran built a beautiful garden by the lake and a memorial chhatri cenotaph on a hill overlooking the lake. Later on, many more cenotaphs were constructed here for Lunkaran and other Bhattis. The last chhatri, meant for Maharawal Jawahir Singh, dates from the 20th century and remains unfinished after Indian independence.  Description  Bada Bagh is situated on a small hill. The memorial chhatri cenotaphs have all been carved out of sandstone blocks, but have been built in at least four different sizes - for the ruling kings, their queens, their princes, and other royal family members. Each cenotaph has a marble slab with inscriptions about the deceased royal and a symbolic image of a man on a horse.

They also compete in District 1-8A of the Florida High School Athletic Association(FHSAA). Class 8A is the largest of the FHSAA divisions and regarded as one of the toughest in the nation. One of the first major high schools on Jacksonville's rapidly growing Southside, Sandalwood experienced tremendous growth throughout the 70s and 80s. They were the first Jacksonville area team to compete in the State's largest high school football district, moving up from class 4A to 6A in just under a decade. From 1989-1999, Sandalwood competed in the 2-6A district which consisted of six teams(Tallahassee Lincoln, Lake City Columbia, Mandarin, Orange Park, Tallahassee Leon). This district alignment was the largest in Florida at the time, and highly regarded as one of the toughest high school divisions in Florida. The Saints were known for their stingy 4-4 defense and ball control Wing-T offense. While structured within this district format, Sandalwood teams had to travel three hours for some district games including contests against Tallahassee Leon High School and Lincoln High School (Tallahassee, Florida) and Lake City Columbia High School. In an attempt to create equal competition amongst top tier schools, the FHSAA replaced Tallahassee Leon with St. Augustine High School in 1997. They also realigned teams in District 2-6A by looping Jacksonville's 6A schools into a district with Orlando schools in 2000. Yet these realignments were met with complaints from coaches of both Jacksonville and Orlando schools about the continued long travel distances for district games. After further discussions, the FHSAA in 2003 realigned Sandalwood into a two-team district (1-6A) with Orange Park High School. This again created much controversy throughout the state due to the current playoff format granting post season berths to district champions and runners-ups. With this format Sandalwood was granted playoff berths regardless of their record in 2003 and 2004. Finally, to silence the decade long controversy amongst North Florida 6A high school teams, the 1-6A district was formed in 2005 possessing four Jacksonville area schools to compete for two playoff spots. In 2011, Sandalwood entered the newly created 1-8A District, the largest in Florida. It meant a return to the crowded six team districts which the school competed in throughout the 1990s. Regardless of district alignment, Sandalwood has proven its ability to adapt and remain one of the top football programs in Florida. The new era of Sandalwood football features a spread offense, one much different than the Wing-T of days past. But this hasn't stopped the recipe for winning as Sandalwood possesses a winning record in 14 of the last 16 seasons. They currently have 23 FHSAA playoff appearances with 12 wins and 11 losses. Updated (07/2011) Noteworthy season In 1995, The Sandalwood Saints varsity football team went 14-1, losing in the Class 6A Championship Game to Miami Northwestern High School 12-7. The Saints were led by a tenacious defense and the \\"USA Today Florida Player of the Year\\" and \\"Florida's Mr. Football\\" running back Frankie Franklin. Franklin was injured in the regional playoff semifinals and was limited in playoff action. The Saints were ranked No. 4 in the National USA Today Prep rankings that year before losing in the state championship game.

Life Willson was born at Lincoln, England. His father, a builder, belonged to the Church of England, but became a Roman Catholic late in life; his mother was a devout Roman Catholic. In his twentieth year he decided to enter a religious life as a lay brother, but was advised to study for the priesthood. He entered the College of Old Oscott in 1816, was ordained priest in December 1824, and was sent to Nottingham. When he arrived there was a small chapel that would hold 150 people with difficulty, and as the congregation was increasing, Willson found a good site and built St John the Evangelist's Catholic Church, Nottingham, which was completed in 1828. He began to take special interest in the prisons and the lunatic asylum, was placed on the boards of the county hospital and the lunatic asylum, and personally visited the inmates and obtained much influence over them. During the cholera epidemic in 1832 he worked with the Quaker, Samuel Fox, caring for those affected and arranging burials. He was presented with the freedom of Nottingham. His congregation increased and he decided that a large church must be built on a worthy site. Gradually the group of buildings which eventually became the Cathedral of St Barnabas with adjacent schools and convent came into being. He found time to edit and contribute an introductory address to W.L. Stone's A Complete Refutation of Maria Monk's Atrocious Plot, concerning the Hotel Dieu Convent in Montreal. Early in 1842 he was appointed bishop to the new see of Hobart, Tasmania. Efforts were made to have his services retained in England, but in January 1844 he sailed for Australia and he arrived at Hobart on 11 May 1844. Australia Willson was faced with a difficulty directly he landed. He had made a condition on accepting the See that Rev John Joseph Therry be transferred from Hobart to another see. This had not been done and Willson removed Therry from office. He was told the diocese was not encumbered by debt but learned there was, in fact, a considerable debt. In August he went to Sydney to confer with Archbishop Polding on these matters, but 14 years were to elapse before a satisfactory arrangement was agreed to. On his return from Sydney, Willson began his important work of the amelioration of the conditions of the 30,000 convicts then in Tasmania. At the end of 1846 he sailed for England and his evidence before the committee then sitting on the convict system made a deep impression. He returned to Hobart in December 1847 and hearing that conditions at Norfolk Island were rather worse than better, determined to see for himself. After his visit, he wrote a strong recommendation to Governor Denison that the penal settlement on the island should be abandoned as soon as possible. He made practical and valuable recommendations for reforms to be made in the meanwhile. These activities were not allowed to interfere with the conduct of his church work. Catholic schools were opened, a library was established, and new churches were built. In 1853, when an ailing Willson was advised to take a voyage to Europe, among the many addresses presented to him none touched him more than one signed by a large number of well-known residents who did not belong to his church. He returned to Hobart early in 1855, but he began to feel his years and in 1859 applied for a coadjutor. In February 1865 Willson left for Europe. On the voyage, he was struck down by paralysis from which he never fully recovered. He went to live among his friends at Nottingham and died there in 1866. His remains are now lying in Tasmania. Posthumous In 2005 permission was given for his remains to be exhumed and returned to Australia. His remains were exhumed in February 2017.

He previously served as the head coach at Auburn and UTEP. Barbee led UTEP to a Conference USA championship in 2010 and was named Conference USA Coach of the Year. Barbee played college basketball for Massachusetts under John Calipari, winning two Atlantic 10 regular season and tournament championships in 1992 and 1993. Early years Barbee was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and grew up as a fan of the nearby Butler University Bulldogs. Butler recruited him to play for the team, but Barbee chose to play for Massachusetts instead. In his four years as a Minuteman, Barbee averaged double-figures in scoring every year. He finished with 1,643 career points. The Atlantic 10 named him to the league Freshman Team in 1989‚Äì90, and the Second Team in 1990‚Äì91 and 1992‚Äì93. The Minutemen compiled a 91‚Äì39 () overall record during Barbee's four years, and advanced to two NITs and two NCAA Tournaments. He graduated in 1993 with a degree in Sports Management. After UMass, Barbee played professional basketball in Spain and France. Assistant coaching For the 1995‚Äì96 season, Barbee and former teammate Derek Kellogg returned to college basketball as a graduate assistant at UMass, helping as the Minutemen reached the Final Four for the first time in program history. After Calipari moved to the NBA and Bruiser Flint was promoted to head coach, Barbee was also promoted to assistant coach, where he would work with the Minutemen for two additional seasons. Barbee spent the 1998‚Äì99 season as an assistant coach with Wyoming. He then returned to UMass for one more season, and then moved to Calipari's staff again, this time at Memphis, starting in the 2000‚Äì01 season, where he would establish a reputation as an excellent recruiter. Barbee spent six years with the Tigers, as the team compiled a 148‚Äì59 () record. Barbee Reunited with Coach Calipari for the 2014-2015 season. This time at the University of Kentucky where he served as the Special Assistant to the Head Coach, in this role Barbee assisted in a multitude of roles, including game-plan preparation and practice plans. With Barbee‚Äôs help the Wildcats enjoyed one of the most storied seasons in program history, becoming the first team in NCAA history to begin a season 38-0 while claiming the SEC regular-season and tournament crowns, advancing to the program‚Äôs fourth Final Four in Five seasons, and helping six players go in the NBA Draft. UTEP Barbee was hired as the coach of the Miners on August 14, 2006, succeeding Doc Sadler, who moved to coach Nebraska. Barbee was the first African-American head coach in UTEP men's basketball history. This was another milestone for the program, as their 1966 team, then known as Texas Western, became the first team with five African-American starters to win a title game, defeating Kentucky and their all-white team. Barbee spent four seasons in El Paso, and the Miners improved steadily each year. The 2009‚Äì10 season was the highlight during Barbee's tenure. The Miners made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five seasons. Their regular season conference title was the first since the 2003‚Äì04 season, when UTEP was a member of the WAC. Barbee was named the C-USA Coach of the Year, as well as the NABC District 11 Coach of the Year. The Miners went 82‚Äì52 () under Barbee's leadership. Auburn Barbee coaching in 2013 Tony Barbee was named the head coach of the Auburn men's basketball team on March 24, 2010 and was formally introduced the following day in Auburn Arena. Barbee became the first black head men's or women's basketball coach at Auburn. Tony Barbee lost his first game as Auburn's head coach on November 12, 2010 to UNC Asheville in overtime 70‚Äì69. This was also the first men's basketball game played in Auburn Arena. Barbee did not get his first win at Auburn until the 4th game of his first season, beating Middle Tennessee 68‚Äì66. However, after this rough start, Barbee's first Auburn team managed to remain competitive in the SEC, so much so that his former coach John Calipari went as far as to say that Barbee should be considered for SEC Coach of the Year. Despite showing promise at the end of his first season, Barbee never had a winning season at Auburn. His best record came in the 2011‚Äì12 season when Auburn finished 15‚Äì16. Auburn then lost 16 of 17 SEC games during a stretch of the 2012‚Äì13 season under Barbee, and had yet another losing season in 2013‚Äì14. The Barbee era at Auburn was fraught with off the court issues. Following the 2011‚Äì12 season, Auburn point guard Varez Ward was arrested on charges of point shaving. This case was later dismissed when Ward went into a pre-trial diversion program and with full cooperation with the FBI, neither Auburn nor Ward were found guilty of any wrongdoing. Of the 21 players that Barbee signed while at Auburn, only 9 remained on his roster in his 4th season due to player dismissals and transfers. Barbee was fired on March 12, 2014, minutes after losing in the first round of the SEC Tournament to South Carolina 74‚Äì56. He finished with a cumulative record of 49‚Äì75 (.395), the lowest winning percentage of any Auburn head coach with more than a two-season tenure.

It is the first installment on the Mario & Sonic series. It was published by Nintendo in Japan and by Sega in other regions, and released on the Wii in November 2007 and the Nintendo DS handheld in January 2008. The first official video game of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, it is licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through exclusive licensee International Sports Multimedia (ISM), and is the first official crossover game to feature characters from both the Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog series. Mario & Sonic on the Wii and DS is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character, using the Wii Remote to mimic sports actions such as swinging a paddle. The DS version uses the stylus and button controls. Both games follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting sportsmanship and interest young people in the Olympics by using its characters; following this theme, Nintendo allowed Sega to include Mario with Sonic the Hedgehog, created by Sega as a mascot to rival Mario in the early 1990s. Critics praised the multiplayer interaction of the Wii game, and variety of events of both versions, but criticized the Wii version for its complexity and its DS counterpart for not offering the same interaction between players. The Wii game was awarded the \\"Best Wii game of 2007\\" at the Games Convention in Leipzig. Mario & Sonic sold over 10 million units and started a series of related sport video games to coincide with upcoming Olympic events. Gameplay The player twists the Wii Remote and presses various buttons, as instructed, to perform tricks in the trampolining event. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote in a manner similar to the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuk is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen. Mario & Sonic brings together the two title characters and fourteen more from both franchises to participate in environments based on the official venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art styles of the Sonic and Mario franchises respectively. Each playable character has his or her own statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill. The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature. Both games have non-playable characters who serve as referees for particular events. \\"Dream Events\\" are alternate versions of Olympic events. In the DS-exclusive event \\"Dream Canoe\\", players can use items from the Mario Kart games. Both versions of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games have three similar modes of gameplay: Circuit mode, Single Match, and Mission mode. Circuit mode is where players compete for the highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events or design their own circuit. In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. DS Download Play is possible for those without an individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited to six events and circuit mode is not available. Both versions feature a gallery mode where brief facts about the Olympics can be found. There are five categories of Olympics-related trivia organized by history and athletes, with corresponding minigames that will unlock the answer to trivia questions once completed. Classic music from both series is available in the gallery once all levels in a category are cleared. The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to display the best times and scores in each event. =Events= Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games features authentic Olympic events for the single match and circuit modes. The events closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. The types of Wii events are classified as athletics, gymnastics, shooting, archery, rowing, aquatics, fencing, and table tennis. Similar events have varying gameplay aspects; for example, getting a starting boost in the is more important than in the longer races, since the initial short burst of greater speed would play less of a role in winning the longer distance runs. In relay events, such as the relay and aquatics relay, players can assemble teams comprising any four characters. Besides these regular events, there are alternate versions of Olympic events called \\"Dream Events\\". Unlike the regular events, the gameplay in Dream Events is exaggerated. Taking place in locations and using objects from older games of the Mario and Sonic series, Dream Events allow players to use the special abilities of characters and display dramatic moments in slow motion. Although the Wii and DS versions of the game feature mostly the same events, each version has events that are not found in the other. The relay races and rowing are exclusive to the Wii version. In contrast, the DS version has cycling and five Dream Events‚Äîcanoeing, boxing, basketball, long jump, and skeet shooting‚Äînot featured on the Wii version. Development After Sega transited from hardware to third-party development in 2001, Nintendo and Sega developed a closer relationship and worked together on F-Zero GX‚Äîthe first significant video game collaboration between the two. The idea for a crossover game between Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Mario characters had been casually discussed between the two companies; the mascots' creators Yuji Naka and Shigeru Miyamoto, respectively, had their private discussions revealed in 2005. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s. Despite the discussions, the idea was not acted on as it lacked a setting that would give the game \\"an exclamation mark\\". The idea of an Olympic setting for the mascots originated after Sega was awarded the Beijing 2008 Olympic license approximately a year later. The developer adopted the IOC's mission to promote a sporting spirit and wanted to interest young people in the Olympics with its newly acquired license. The corporation decided to base the sports game around its characters that \\"young people love and are very iconic\\" instead of creating a more realistic simulation. Sega then requested Nintendo for permission to include Mario in the game, setting up the first matchup between their mascots. Nintendo approved and partnered with Sega in-house to add another layer of quality control to the development. Both companies felt that the competitive sportsmanship of the Olympic Games provided an ideal choice as a setting for the once-rival mascots. Mario & Sonic was officially announced with a joint press release by Sega and Nintendo on March 28, 2007 and premiered at E3 2007. In another showing of the collaboration between the two companies, the game was predominantly developed by the Sega Sports R&D; Department of Sega Japan under the supervision of Shigeru Miyamoto. He served as senior producer. Sega's Osamu Ohashi and Nintendo's Hiroshi Sato served as producers, Eigo Kasahara as director, and Teruhiko Nakagawa as composer. Racjin and according to gaming site IGN, TOSE, a developer known to avoid crediting itself in its works, helped to develop Mario & Sonic. The game is officially licensed by the IOC through exclusive licensee ISM and is the first official video game of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. The president of Sega Europe stated that they originally planned a number of events, including judo, to fully epitomize the Olympics. However, the figure for the final product was reduced and judo was omitted. The development of the game was swifter than planned; in October 2007, Sega announced that Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games scheduled release date for the Wii has been advanced by two weeks and the game had gone gold. It was released in 2007 in North America on November 6, in Japan on November 22, in Australia and in Europe on November 23, and in Korea on May 29, 2008. The DS version followed in 2008 in Japan on January 17, in North America on January 22, in Australia on February 7, in Europe on February 8, and in South Korea on June 26. Both versions were published by Nintendo for Japan (where it is known as ) and by Sega for North America, Europe and all other regions. Reception=Sales= Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games was a commercial success; in the first few months after its release, the game was on four separate occasions the top-selling game in the United Kingdom all-formats chart. It accumulated seven weeks as the number-one seller, including the first two weeks after its release. The Wii version sold a half-million units in the UK during those seven weeks. By June 2008, both Wii and DS versions reached combined sales of 1.2 million copies in the UK, prompting Sega to create plans on re-marketing the game there. The game went on to sell over two million units combined in the country. According to the NPD Group, the Wii game was one of the top-ten best-sellers for the month of December 2007 in the United States, selling 613,000 units. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst Jesse Divnich argued the game is a fitting example of brand awareness' role in determining Wii game sales. The Wii is an exception to the correlation that higher quality games lead to better sales as seen on the Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. Divnich added \\"To the casual and social gamer, it didn't matter that the game received sub-70 Metacritic scores,\\" the recognizable \\"Mario\\" and \\"Sonic\\" brand names participating in a recognizable action, \\"The Olympic Games,\\" contributed to the game's US sales. As of December 28, 2008, 594,157 units of the Wii version and as of December 27, 2009, 383,655 copies of the Nintendo DS version has been sold in Japan. The Nintendo DS version is the twenty-seventh best-selling game of Japan for 2008. In the same year for Australia, it is the eighth best-selling game while the Wii version is number four. In July 2008, Simon Jeffrey, president of Sega of America, announced that Sega has sold approximately 10 million units worldwide combined of Mario & Sonic and showed interest in again collaborating with Nintendo to produce another game featuring the two companies' mascots. The game is listed in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2010 book as the \\"Best-selling gaming character cross-over\\" with 7.09 million on Wii and 4.22 million copies on DS sold. =Critical response= Although the Wii version of Mario and Sonic was awarded the \\"Best Wii game of 2007\\" at the Games Convention in Leipzig, it received mixed reactions from game critics; the DS version had a similar reception. A common complaint was that Sega and Nintendo failed to set the first matchup between their mascots in the genre that made them famous‚Äîplatform games. Instead, the two companies threw Mario and Sonic into an Olympic-themed party video game, a move which Tae Kim of GamePro criticized as \\"a marketing tool\\" to popularize the XXIX Olympic Games. Although the Wii version of the game was praised for being an entertaining multiplayer experience, it was criticized for shallow gameplay and complex rules and instructions. GameTrailers concluded that Mario & Sonic's lack of \\"polish and simplicity\\" leaves the improbable grouping of mascots as its main attraction when compared to other party video games released for the platform. GameSpot's Aaron Thomas rated the Wii version's motion control scheme as \\"uninteresting and occasionally frustrating\\". X-Play's Morgan Webb agreed, calling the controls \\"non-intuitive\\" and commenting that the minigames required players to \\"wave their Wiimotes frantically while pressing several buttons at the same time\\". Dan Hsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly mentioned that the controls were complicated for a game that should be a \\"pure pick-up-and- play party game\\". Tae Kim said the events were \\"short and fairly shallow\\" and mostly required players to move the \\"Wii Remote and Nunchuks in specific ways‚Äîrapidly up and down for running events, for example\\". Mark Bozon of IGN called Mario & Sonic a success due to the entertainment value derived from the slight variety of competitions offered in the game. However, he and several other critics felt that events within the same classification were similar; Bozon noted that diversity was lacking as \\"five or six [events felt] nearly identical\\", and Thomas found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both reviewers favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes with that of the Mario sport games and archery. On the Nintendo DS, Mario & Sonic was regarded as virtually the same game in design as its Wii counterpart; however, opinions on its control scheme varied greatly. GameSpy's Gerald Villoria thought the tradeoffs between both versions made them equally enjoyable. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com assured readers in his review that the less physically demanding gameplay of the DS version made the game accessible for extended periods of time. Fitch further stated that in nearly \\"every case, events [were] far more enjoyable on the DS\\" due to the requirement of the human body's finer motor skill abilities to control the characters. However, Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson noted that the lack of physical demand reduced the players' engrossment with the game. Craig Harris of IGN had a similar opinion, stating, \\"Rapidly drumming the controllers is far more challenging than quickly stroking the touchscreen.\\" Harris felt the DS version lost some relevance to its marginally superior Wii counterpart since had a similar design and released almost three months afterwards. Most publications agreed that the Wii counterpart of Mario & Sonic had clean textures and well-done animations; N-Europe's Iun Hockley thought that each character was pleasingly rendered, and Thomas added that the graphics were \\"crisp and colorful\\". Mark Bozon preferred the remixed Nintendo and Sega music and thought the general Olympic-related music \\"[could] be a bit generic\\". GameDaily's Robert Workman called the background music \\"mostly forgettable\\". Echoing this sentiment for the DS version, Emily Balistrieri of GamePro thought \\"most of the music [wasn't] too interesting\\". Compared to the Wii version, the DS version's visuals are of the same style and its graphics are nearly on the same level. Due to the inability to compete against other players online, Harris regarded Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games limited use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a \\"missed opportunity\\". Many reviewers, including Gibson and Pro-G's James Orry, found the uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process. Although the home console version also has online rankings, it lacks direct competition between players. Disappointed with the aforementioned aspect, Bozon rationalized that the leaderboards \\"certainly [made] sense for a game like this\\". =Legacy= Sonic at the Olympic Games is a Sonic-themed sports game for mobile phones released in June 2008. Developed by AirPlay and published by Sega, the game features five events based on the Olympic Games starring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy. Players control one character from a two-dimensional prospective through one-button commands. The commercial success of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games started a series of Mario & Sonic sport video games to coincide with upcoming Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Sean Ratcliffe, vice president of marketing at Sega of America said, \\"I think the key factor that decides the ongoing building of this franchise is basically success. Is the game successful? Are consumers happy with it?\\" Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games is based on the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and released on the Wii and the Nintendo DS in October 2009, sold 6.53 million copies in the US and Europe by March 31, 2010. Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games is based on the 2012 Summer Olympics and was released on the Wii in November 2011 and the Nintendo 3DS in February 2012. The Wii and the 3DS games sold 3.28 million copies in the US and Europe by March 31, 2012. Video games based on the Summer and Winter Games continue to be released.

It was first performed on 3 August 1621, and was the biggest popular hit of Jonson's masquing career. Buckingham The masque was sponsored (and paid for) by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham -- at that time the Marquis of Buckingham -- the court favorite of King James I. Buckingham was celebrating his 6 May marriage to Lady Katherine Manners, the daughter of the Earl of Rutland. The original 3 August performance occurred at Burley (then Burleigh- on-the-Hill), Buckingham's country house; it was repeated two days later, on 5 August, at Belvoir Castle in Lincolnshire, the country seat of Buckingham's father-in-law the Earl of Rutland; and it was staged a highly unusual third time at Windsor Castle in September. The show The masque was a bold and fresh departure from what was normal for the masque form, in that it featured none of the classical gods and goddesses, the mythological figures, or the personifications of abstract qualities that were standard in masques. Instead, the characters are, as the title indicates, gypsies, who behave for the most part in stereotypical gypsy fashion: they sing and dance frequently, they tell fortunes, and they pick the pockets of the common people who fall in among them. In the masque, the gypsies' \\"metamorphosis\\" is that their complexions change from \\"Ethiop\\" darkness to English white, under the beneficent royal influence of James.Jonson had earlier experimented with this theme of racial transformation in The Masque of Blackness (1605) and The Masque of Beauty (1608). The transformative make-up was provided by the court apothecary John Wolfgang Rumler. Thereupon they return all the stolen goods to their proper owners. One of the masque's unusual features is that aristocrats not only danced in the masque, which was common, but took speaking roles too, which was not. Buckingham himself had a speaking part in which he addressed the King directly; his family and friends were also in the cast. Another unusual feature was the telling of fortunes for the aristocrats of the court. In the first version, fortunes were provided for noblewomen, including Katherine Manners, Lady Elizabeth Hatton, and the Countesses of Rutland, Exeter, and Buckingham (the latter being the favorite's mother); in a later revised version, prominent courtiers like the Earl of Pembroke and Frances, Countess of Exeter received their fortunes (which of course were always positive and complementary). Costs The free-spending Buckingham paid Jonson the unusual sum of ¬£100 for his work on the masque, double the usual sum of 40-50 pounds; but Lanier was even more generously rewarded for his music, receiving ¬£200. One of the masque's songs, which begins with the line \\"Cocklorrel would needs have the devil his guest,\\" was a popular hit, both in its own time and well into the Restoration era. (A musical setting for the song survives, though it is anonymous and not certainly Lanier's; other song settings for the masque, by Robert Johnson and Edmund Chilmead, also exist, testifying to the work's popularity.)Walls, pp. 273-4. Texts The masque was included in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641; it also received a separate publication in 1640, in a duodecimo volume issued by John Okes. The work also exists in manuscript versions; one is an autograph manuscript, the only surviving MS. in Jonson's hand. The manuscripts have been helpful to scholars in repairing the deficiencies of the printed texts, which jumble together the original and revised versions of the masque. Critical responses The Gypsies Metamorphosed was not only popular with its Jacobean audience; modern critics have tended to judge it affirmatively as well. At least one modern scholar has considered it \\"Jonson's finest achievement as a writer of masques.\\"Dale B. J. Randall, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 80. The masque's multiple levels of meaning have attracted a wide range of critical commentary.See, for example, Skantze, pp. 51-8; Netzloff, pp. 136-48 and 163-8; and Blank, pp. 61-7; as well as the studies cited in Logan and Smith, p. 80.

This measure is a ratio, and so is typically measured as a percentage (or on a scale from 0 to 100). The total dollar sales that go into ACV include the entire store inventory sales, rather than sales for a specific category of products ‚Äì hence the term \\"all commodity volume.\\" ACV is best related to the key marketing concept of placement (Distribution). Distribution metrics quantify the availability of products sold through retailers, usually as a percentage of all potential outlets. Often, outlets are weighted by their share of category sales or \\"all-commodity\\" sales. For marketers who sell through resellers, distribution metrics reveal a brand's percentage of market access. Balancing a firm's efforts in \\"push\\" (building and maintaining reseller and distribution support) and \\"pull\\" (generating customer demand) is an ongoing strategic concern for marketers.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. Purpose All-commodity volume measures a firm's ability to convey a product to its customers in terms of total sales among outlets carrying the brand. Construction All-commodity volume (ACV) is a weighted measure of product availability, or distribution, based on total store sales. In other words, ACV is the percentage of sales in all categories that are generated by the stores that stock a given brand (again, at least one SKU of that brand) (note: ACV can be expressed as a percentage or as a dollar value (total sales of stores carrying brand). :All Commodity Volume (ACV) Distribution (%) = :100 x Total Sales of Stores Carrying Brand ($) √∑ Total Sales of All Outlets ($) Usage discussion of ACV This is the annual dollar sale for a geography in millions of dollars. When dividing total sales for an outlet into ACV million dollar blocks, it allows for equivalization across inherently different sized market or retailers in size. A large share of sales in Des Moines may or may not be as important as having a lesser share in New York City. The open question in the above case can be resolved by dividing sales regardless of outlet into a sales rate per million dollars. =Example calculation= Assume in a city there are two hardware retailers. * The first retailer boasts five big-box store locations that boast weekly ACV (total sales of all products across all stores) of $15MM per week. * The second retailer may also feature five store locations, but they tend to be closer to mom and pop size, with average weekly ACV at only $5MM per week. * The total market size is ten hardware stores, and $20MM in total market ACV. Assuming a tool-set a company produces is only distributed in the second smaller-store chain, it is obviously represented in half the store locations (50%). However, all stores are not created equal; based on the above numbers, the tool-set would only be selling in a quarter of the total market ACV (25%). In the converse scenario of distribution within only the big-box retailer, the tool-set would similarly be distributed in half the stores, but those stores would represent 75% total market ACV. Given the choice, a business typically prefers its distribution in higher-volume stores for the greater sales potential. More consumers spending more total dollars occurs in these outlets, indicating more traffic and/or average spend per consumer. Within marketing and sales circles, the percentage of stores a product sells within is less relevant than a product's share of the store ACV value. Examples of application Based on the above logic, common applications of ACV equivalization are as follows: * The overall importance of one retailer vs. another in terms of sales volume, or even geographical locations (e.g., New York Metro vs. Omaha). * An item (e.g., mayonnaise), or even grouping of items (e.g., grocery dry goods) has an average share of every million dollars of sales in a sales outlet, representing its overall importance to that outlet. * As the example above, an item or aggregated grouping of items can have its distribution measured in equivalized fashion ‚Äì what percentage of the total market ACV does a product actually sell in (i.e., appear on the shelf)? * Related to share above, an item or category of items can have a sales rate per million dollars of ACV. This allows for comparison of how well an item sells in one outlet vs. another regardless of its overall distribution. This is often referred to as weighted sales velocity. * What percentage of ACV$ in a market is a product or grouping benefiting from trade merchandising such as feature advertisements, in-store point of sale display, coupons, etc. One can then deduce how much one time period has extra merchandising support versus another.

The village was named after the birth country of Polish explorer and engineer Stanis≈Çaw Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski, who aided the villagers. He solved the problem of effectively watering palm trees during the dry season by suggesting a modified irrigation system, then helping to build it, and teaching how to use it. The village was featured in one of the promotional videos for the 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Warsaw, Poland.  Location  Poland is located on the westernmost part of the island, at geographic coordinates: . Demographics Poland's population is 441 people (Census 2010).Report on the Kiribati 2010 Census of Population and Housing. Vol 1: Basic Information and Tables. Part B: Personal (Population) Tables. Table 3: Population by Village, Sex and Age Group - 2010. S. 50.  Name  The village was named in honour of a Pole whose name was Stanis≈Çaw (Stanislaus) Pe≈Çczy≈Ñski. Having arrived with an American merchant vessel that was plying the copra trade at a time, when the local inhabitants were having difficulties irrigating their palm tree plantations, Stanis≈Çaw helped them solve the problem. Accordingly, the village was renamed to its present-day name in his honor. Also, a church was built there and dedicated under the auspices of Saint Stanislaus, and a bay in the lagoon was named Saint Stanislaus Bay.  Education  There is a primary school with three main teachers and 45 students. References Sources  *R.

In 1962 Borozdin moved to Siberia and began teaching cello classes in the local children music school and had discovered talents of many young cellists. His pupils won more than 70 competitions at all levels, including the International Cello Competition in Cremona, Italy (V. Voropaev, 1997). In 1960s-80s he also played in the Academia orchestra in Akademgorodok, a science campus-town near the city of Novosibirsk, USSR. Following his musical career, in the 1970s-80s Borozdin recovered and transcribed into modern notation over 6000 pages of scores by Josef Mysliveƒçek, a brilliant Czech composer of the 18th century. In 1993, he had been awarded an honorary State title of Distinguished Culture Worker of Russia. Encouraged by the effect music had on even the most socially problematic students, in 1991 Borozdin set up a school of music and art therapy for mentally handicapped children, which was supported by several international foundations (George Soros Foundation, Alexander Solzhenitsyn Foundation, CAF, etc.). In 1997, Borozdin was awarded one of the first George Soros Russian Zealot Prizes for his work with disabled children.

The Court of Criminal Jurisdiction was the first criminal court in the colony. The Court was abolished in 1823, replaced by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Background The British government established the colony of New South Wales primarily as a penal colony, although it did encourage settlement. Its principal purpose was to house prisoners from Great Britain. Captain Arthur Phillip was appointed as the colony's first governor. Arthur Phillip The British authorities foresaw the need for a judicial system to be established in the colony to deal with criminal matters. This was to be a two-tier system. The higher tier was to be the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, which was to deal with the major offences occurring in the colony. The lower tier was to be the existing English system of appointing justices of the peace to administer the lesser type of offences. Jurisdiction The court was empowered to deal with any crimes committed in the colony of New South Wales. The colony at that time took in what is now Tasmania, then called Van Diemen's Land, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory, and of the course the current state of New South Wales. The scope of the colony was quite limited in its early days, so jurisdiction over places such as South Australia did not practically occur. In the case of Van Diemen's Land, the court rarely sat there, and prisoners were brought to Sydney for trial, or dealt with summarily in Hobart. The court also had jurisdiction to deal with offences in the colony of Norfolk Island, although it did not sit on that island. Prisoners were usually shipped back to Sydney to be dealt with. Technically, the court had jurisdiction over offences committed in New Zealand but practically did not deal with any such matters. Constitution The court was a statutory court established under an act of the British Parliament. The court had virtually unlimited powers to deal with criminal offences. The court was constituted by the colony's Deputy Judge Advocate, or as the office came to be more commonly called, Judge Advocate. He sat, as president of the court, with six military officers to constitute the tribunal. The first Deputy Judge Advocate was David Collins. In its early days, the court was convened when required. It was convened following a precept issued by the Governor under his hand and seal. There were therefore no regular sittings during the early years of the settlement, and it met only whenever the Governor summoned it. Procedure The procedure at the trial of an offender was different from the criminal procedures then existing in criminal courts in England. The charge against the prisoner was not a formal indictment; instead, it was a plain statement of the offence committed. Lawyers were not permitted (and in the early days of the court, there were none in the colony anyway), so technical objections were unlikely to arise. Only one of the judge-advocates appointed to the role over the years was a lawyer. The rest were just military officers, so their knowledge of the law was not great. The first court assembled in full military regalia with a full military guard. Phillip wished the first sittings to be an example to the convicts and to impress upon them the authority of the court and the rule of law. Collins later in his memoirs reflected that the first court was a failure, as the sentences imposed were not sufficiently strong to deter crimes in the colony.An Account of the Colony of New South Wales p. 27. David Collins The judge-advocate was the presiding officer, and would do everything a normal judge would do. Unlike a judge, though, he was also one of the jury. This differed substantially from how criminal justice was administered in England. When the prisoner was brought before the court, the charge was read over to him or her, and he or she was called upon to plead. Witnesses were then examined for the Crown. The prosecution was not conducted by the judge-advocate. Instead, in line with the practice of Courts- martial in England, it was left in the hands of the person who had made the charge.Tench, A Narrative on the Colony of New South Wales, p. 70. In contrast to the English situation, the prisoner was allowed to cross-examine the crown's witnesses.Castle, A Legal History of Australia, Chapter 4. The prisoner was left to conduct his defence without legal assistance. At the conclusion of the case, the Court was cleared, and the judge-advocate and the officers deliberated over their verdict. As soon as they reached their decision, the doors were opened again and the sentence was pronounced in public. In cases not involving the punishment of death, a verdict of the majority was sufficient. If the charge was a capital offence (and nearly every criminal charge in those days was capital) the concurrence of five members of the Court was necessary before the sentence could be carried out. Where fewer than five members of the court concurred, the proceedings had to be sent to the British Government for its consideration. Punishment The court was expressly limited to two forms of punishment. These were death, in capital cases, or flogging, in non-capital cases. Fines or imprisonment were not an option as there were no local gaols nor would prisoners have the money to pay a fine in the early days of the settlement. However, Phillip frequently sent prisoners for punishment to the islands in Sydney Harbour, and then subsequently to Norfolk Island when that penal colony was established. The Governor's warrant was a necessary preliminary to an execution; but he was empowered by his commission to grant a pardon in any case which was not treason or murder. He could also reprieve a prisoner until final instructions were received from England. Differences between the court and courts- martial While the Criminal Court was modelled on the basis of court-martial in England at the time, it was essentially different both in its constitution and its practice. The first and most important difference is the position of the judge-advocate. In England that office was always held by a lawyer whose duty it was to conduct the case for the prosecution and to advise the Court on legal points, especially points of evidence. They did not preside as a judge (as the court did in Sydney) and the judicial duties were performed by the president appointed to that particular court-martial. The role of judge advocate was therefore important, as the president of the court was usually a military officer not professionally qualified to deal with legal questions. Trial by court-martial in England was conducted according to the rules of the common law, and consequently the judge advocate was needed to advise on such matters of law as might arise before the tribunal. The judge advocate therefore had no voice or vote so far as the judgment of the Court was concerned. His function was to advise. He also acted as the prosecutor for the Crown, and was also supposed to assist the prisoner in his defence in the same manner that judges in normal criminal courts in those days were supposed to do. This process went some way to ensure a fair trial for the prisoner. The judge-advocate of the New South Wales court created by the Letters Patent of 1787 issued by the British crown bore very little resemblance to the judge- advocate of the English courts. The first person appointed to the office was David Collins, who was a captain of marines. He was not in a position to discharge the duties of a legal adviser. The Court therefore administered the law without any legal assistance. An ordinary court-martial court could get by with the procedures established for it because the offences tried before it were simply breaches of military discipline. Punishment for such breaches were regulated by military law. Unfortunately, the New South Wales court was empowered to deal with the whole range of criminal offences, including both common law and statute law which then existed in England. Later judges appointed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales established nearly fifty years later were to experience similar difficulties in understanding the criminal law which applied in New South Wales. Putting this aside, Collins was satisfied that \\"when the state of the colony and the nature of its inhabitants are considered, it must be agreed that the administration of public justice could not have been placed with so much propriety in any other hands.\\" This is particularly apt as it would have been difficult to find a jury of twelve men at the time (most men in the colony being either military officers or convicts).

During the presidency of Beatriz del Toro in 1929 the sorority was recognized by University Authorities. By 1932 an alumnus chapter called \\"Capitulo Pasivo\\" was organized in San Juan during the presidency of Conchita Santana Campos.

On April 14, 1941 the then president of the Alpha chapter of Eta Gamma Delta, Annie Bonar, inviting this new group to join the now well known Eta Gamma Delta Sorority and become their Beta chapter. After several meetings and visits by the Eta sisters, all the Delta Phi Omega sisters took the formal initiation and became part of Eta Gamma Delta. On 1943 the Alumni chapter at Mayag√ºez was established, calling itself the (Zona Beta), their first president was Virginia Ram√≠rez. It was then that the need for a central governing body became apparent, thus on 1944 the first (Directiva General) was established, Eleonor Lawton was its first president. On March 1946, the ladies of Delta Omega Mu Sorority met with one of the Members of Eta Gamma Delta, Sarah Torres Peralta. The purpose of their visit was to discuss with her the idea of Eta Gamma Delta establishing the Gamma chapter in the Interamerican University at San Germ√°n where Delta Omega Mu was located. After several meetings and discussions the ladies of Delta Omega Mu and others of the beta chapter at Mayag√ºez who studied at the Interamerican became the Gamma chapter of Eta Gamma Delta. Their first chapter president was Rosarito Armstrong. On 1949 the Delta chapter was founded the Catholic University at Ponce, the first chapter president was Rosarito Armstrong the same sister who had been the first president of Gamma chapter. In 1955 an alumnus chapter (Zona) was founded at Ponce the first president was Pr√°xes Torres de Garc√≠a. On 1990 the Zeta chapter was established at the University of Sagrado Corazon.

She was the consort of Proetus, joint-king in the Argolid with Acrisius, having his seat at Tiryns. According to early sources, Stheneboea was the daughter of Aphidas and brother of Aleus.An early genealogy in Hesiod's Catalogue of Women (Hesiod fragment 129 Merkelbach‚ÄìWest numbering, Most, pp. 148‚Äì151) has Stheneboea as the daughter of Aleus' father Apheidas (see also Apollodorus 3.9.1) but by the time of Euripides' lost tragedy Stheneboea her father is Iobates (Gantz, I pp. 311‚Äì312), see Apollodorus, 2.2.1, Hyginus, Fabulae 57. Homer and other early writers gave the name of the consort of Proetus as Antea, Antaea, or Anteia.Homer, Iliad vi. 160  Mythology  Stheneboea took a fancy to Bellerophon but was repulsed. As in the Biblical account of Potiphar's wife, she testified falsely against Bellerophon, accusing him of advances and even attempted rape to her husband, who sent him on a deadly mission to Iobates. Bellerophon later returned to Tiryns and punished Stheneboea. Some say that Bellerophon took her for a ride on Pegasus and threw her to the ground but others maintain that this was unworthy of a hero so Bellerophon would not have done such a deed. Others assert that Bellerophon married Stheneboea's sister and consequently it was inevitable that the allegations would be exposed as false so this resulted in Stheneboea's suicide since she feared exposure and public denouncement. Divine judgement was added to this tragic end, since Stheneboea's three daughters were overcome with madness, inflicted by either Hera or Dionysus, and took to ranging over the mountains as maenads, assaulting travellers. Anteia and Potiphar's wife Robert Graves observes that Anteia's attempted seduction of Bellerophon has several Greek parallels and draws attention to Biadice's love for Phrixus, which \\"recalls Potiphar's wife's love for Joseph, a companion myth from Canaan\\"Graves, The Greek Myths (1955; 1960) sub 70.2 \\"Athamas\\". as well as Cretheis and Peleus, Phaedra and Hippolytus or Philonome and Tenes. Graves also notes the parallel in the Egyptian Tale of the Two Brothers,Graves 1960:75.1. Graves note \\"the provenience of the myth is uncertain.\\" from about the end of the second millennium BC.In J.B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (Princeton: Princeton University Press) 1955:23-25.

It has been interpreted in many different ways in the past, but is now thought to be a trace fossil of a slug-like organism that moved by crawling to on-shore surfaces, or near-shore, or burrowing into the sediment. Morphology There are two species within this ichnogenus, C. wilsoni and C. youngi. C. wilsoni consists of paired lateral ridges between which are undulating bars and furrows oriented at an angle to the direction of travel, whereas C. youngi lacks the paired lateral ridges and consists only of undulating transverse bars and furrows. An additional trace fossil, called Musculopodus, is sometimes found at the beginning of Climactichnites trails and represents the body imprint of the animal while it was stationary. Climactichnites range from 0.8 to 30 cm wide and may exceed ten feet long, making Climactichnites by far the largest Cambrian trace fossil. Based on measured ratios of Musculopodus imprints, the animal itself is estimated to have reached 69 cm long. Occurrence Currently, Climactichnites is known only from North America (Missouri, New York, Wisconsin, and Texas in the United States, and Quebec and Ontario in Canada), portions of which were submerged under a shallow equatorial sea during the Cambrian Period. The fossil is found in fine- to coarse-grained sandstones and orthoquartzites which represent sandy, intertidal beach deposits. Microbial mats probably enabled the trace to be preserved. Interpretation Early attempts to interpret the fossil as the body of an alga or siphonophore are easily falsified. Climactichnites is now thought to represent the trail of an organism moving on top of or through the sediment. The animal apparently had a muscular foot and moved by extending either side of its body alternately (sometimes both sides may have been extended in unison) to produce the v-shaped transverse bars. Certainly the animal lacked any appendages, as is evidenced by cross-cutting relationships of the trail with sedimentary structures such as ripple marks. While the identity of the trace-maker remains conjectural, Climactichnites was most likely produced by a large slug-like mollusc; modern gastropods have been observed to produce similar traces. Since it is often associated with surface-produced sedimentary structures, it may have been produced by one of the earliest animals to move about on land. The binding effect of microbial mats on the sediment surface is believed to have contributed to the exceptional preservation of Climactichnites trails.  References  * *Getty, P. R., and J. W.

Chief Oluyole was a distinguished, dominating army commander from Oyo. He rose to fame as Bashorun, a title he subsequently made famous, and was one of the leaders who contributed immensely to the military and economic development of Ibadan during the city's formative years, a period which had its share of tumult and uncertainty. He was born in Old Oyo to the polygamous family of Olukuoye by Omoba Agbonrin, a daughter of the Alaafin Abiodun. Life and career Due to the strain caused by the Yoruba civil wars of the 19th century, Old Oyo's senior chiefs fought among themselves over who was to occupy the vacant throne of the Alaafin of Oyo. This led to the collapse of the empire, which in turn forced many Oyo natives to leave their abode in the West African savannah and move towards the thick forests of southern Yorubaland for their relative safety. However, the resulting influx of northern Yorubas known as Oyos to the hinterland led to skirmishes and later wars with the Egbas, who controlled a large chunk of the region. It was during this era that Oluyole rose to prominence. He first gained esteem when he was a member of the victorious coalition that won the Owu wars, which eventually led to the collapse of many Egba towns including Ibadan. As a reward for the prominent role he played in defeating the Egbas at Ipara and Ijebu-Remo, and to strengthen the disparate Oyo nobility which had weakened as a result of the wars, Oluyole was made the Areago of Ibadan. He later created for himself the post of Osi-Kakanfo, the third in command of the Ibadan army. After the success of the Owu war, a power vacuum emerged in the vital military leadership sphere in Yorubaland. Oluyole took on the challenge in successfully defending his new city, Ibadan, against the regrouped Egbas, the Fulanis and the Dahomeyans. He was later crowned the Oloye Bashorun, a title which made him the military leader of Ibadan and ex officio prime minister of Oyo. By this time, he was considered by many to be a prominent exilarch of the scattered people of Oyo. Possibly only the Alaafin himself had more authority amongst the Oyos. He was also a successful farmer, with large estates of tuber crops and vegetables. He had one of the largest productive plantations in Ibadan, with indigenes always touring his farm, trying to imitate his innovative planting technique. His effective power could be explained by his will to control economic and social events indirectly, as opposed to through blunt force. For the fear of Oluyole, and also for lack of efficient pricing, many traders usually did not sell their products when he took his to the market.

It is known in its native tropical America as sapucaia or castanha-de-sapucaia. The fruit is shaped like a cooking pot and contains edible seeds. Description Dry fruit and seeds Lecythis pisonis is a large, deciduous, dome shaped-tree with a dense leafy crown. It grows to a height of about . The trunk has ascending branches and much fissured, greyish bark. The leaves are pink as they unfurl but become mid-green with dark speckles later. They are leathery, oblong-elliptic with prominent midribs and toothed margins. The flowers form in racemes on the ends of the twigs in September and October. They are purple (occasionally white) with six petals and a central boss of golden stamens and are attractive to bees. The fruits are globose or oblong, cinnamon-coloured and woody, being long and wide. They have a rough pericarp up to thick and a tight-fitting lid that bursts open when they mature. The seeds are red or brown, elliptical and up to long. They take 11 to 12 months to ripen. Distribution Lecythis pisonis grows in the rainforest in eastern tropical America particularly in Brazil. Uses Lecythis pisonis is grown as an ornamental tree with new pink growth and purple flowers at certain times of year. The nuts are edible both raw and cooked. Research has shown that the lipid content is similar to that of corn oil but a high level of certain heavy metals might be toxic and may limit their use as food. They are also eaten by animals and the name \\"monkey pot\\" comes from the old proverb \\"a wise old monkey doesn't stick its hand into a pot\\". This refers to the fact that a young monkey may plunge its hand into the container and not be able to withdraw the fistful of nuts whereas an experienced individual will remove the nuts singly.

Facility  Grace Museum in former Hotel Grace in downtown Abilene. The Grace Museum is a museum housed in the historic Hotel Grace, located in downtown Abilene, Texas. The Hotel Grace was built in 1909 by Col. W. L. Beckham of Greenville, Texas and is located at the corner of Cypress Street and North First Street. The Prairie Style Hotel Grace was initially a three-story structure, a fourth story was added in the late 1920s. A subsequent renovation removed the main portico, bricked up several main story windows and changed the hotel's name to the Drake Hotel. The Drake Hotel eventually ceased operation and fell into disrepair. The Abilene Preservation League and the Abilene Fine Arts Museum banded together in the late 1980s to save the neglected structure and provide a new and improved home for the Abilene Fine Arts Museum. Following major restoration in the early 1990s, the structure was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and opened to the public as the Museums of Abilene in 1992.

Among the current hypnotics, benzodiazepines, especially midazolam might show marked automatism, possibly through their intrinsic anterograde amnesia effect. Barbiturates are known to induce hyperalgesia, i.e. aggravation of pain and for sleeplessness due to pain, if barbiturates are used, more pain and more disorientation would follow leading to drug automation and finally a \\"pseudo\\"suicide.

She was born in Longford, Ireland in the mid-1720s; one of four daughters of James Macartney and Catherine (n√©e Coote), daughter of the eminent judge Thomas Coote and niece of Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont. By the early 1740s, she was in London, accompanying Sarah Lennox, Duchess of Richmond. Horace Walpole's poem The Beauties (1746) mentions her as \\"Fanny\\" among the most prominent women at court. Frances married Fulke Greville of Wilbury House (Wiltshire) in 1748 after an elopement. Greville was a gambler and a dandy, but that he loved his wife is witnessed by her presence (under the character of \\"Flora\\" in his Maxims, Characters, and Reflections (1756). Frances is believed to have contributed to the volume herself. Frances Greville's own career as an amateur poet was marked by one resounding success: her poem, \\"Prayer for Indifference,\\" first published in the Edinburgh Chronicle, in 1759, offers an attack on the cult of sensibility. It was reprinted regularly in the following decades, often paired with a poem in praise of sensibility. Her output otherwise was light, and mostly within the confines of Vers de soci√©t√©. She spent the 1760s and 1770s in travel. Her husband was named envoy to Bavaria in 1764. She was a known conversationalist, befriending Charles and Frances Burney, as well as Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who dedicated his The Critic to her. Her daughter, Frances Anne Crewe, (1748 ‚Äì 1818), became a prominent Whig hostess. Her three sons William (1751 ‚Äì 1837), Henry (1760 ‚Äì 1816) and Charles (1762 ‚Äì 1832) had military careers. Henry later became a theatrical manager, though a rather unsuccessful one. Mrs Crewe, daughter of Fulke and Frances Greville Frances died in 1789 at Hampton Court Green.

An icon corner in Romania. The icon corner, sacred corner or red corner, ( - meaning red, bright-shining, or beautiful corner) is a small worship space prepared in the homes of Eastern Orthodox, Greek-Catholic and Roman Catholic Christians. It also appears in homes of Rodnovers and have pre-Christian roots. The analogous concept in Western Christianity is the home altar. History The Book of Acts and the Epistles of the Apostle Paul record that in the early Church, Christians used to meet in the homes of the faithful. (, , , etc.) This tradition of the \\"House Church\\" continues to this day in Eastern Christianity. The home is considered to be a microcosm of the Church. The parents (both the husband and the wife) are the \\"clergy\\" of the house church, and the children are the \\"laity\\". The wedding ceremony (\\"crowning\\") is analogous to Ordination, and the house is blessed with a rite that is based upon the Consecration of a Church. Once a year, the priest will come to bless the house with Theophany Water. Background An Orthodox Christian is expected to pray constantly. According to Bishop Kallistos Ware, \\"[I]n Orthodox spirituality, [there is] no separation between liturgy and private devotion.\\"Timothy Ware, The Orthodox Church (Penguin Books, London, 1964, ), p. 310. Thus the house, just like the Temple (church building), is considered to be a consecrated place, and the center of worship in the house is the icon corner. An icon corner is normally oriented to face east. It is often located in a corner to eliminate worldly distractions and allow prayer to be more concentrated. Here is where the icons that the family owns should be located, normally including at least icons of Christ, the Theotokos, and the Patron Saint(s) of the family. An oil lamp normally hangs in front of the icons. The careful trimming of the lamp to keep it burning at all times is interpreted as symbolic of the attentive daily care faithful Christians should take over their souls. Relics of saints (if the family possesses any) and a Gospel Book and a blessing cross would be kept there, as well as incense, holy water, palms and pussywillow from Palm Sunday, candles from Pascha (Easter), and other sacred items, as well as a personal Commemoration Book (containing the names of family and loved ones, both living and departed, to be remembered in prayer). Ideally, the icon corner is located so that it is visible when one first enters the house from the main entrance. Traditionally, when first entering the house, an Orthodox Christian would venerate the icons before greeting the members of the house. A traditional Orthodox family will gather together every day for morning and evening prayers. Sometimes, at the end of the prayers, the head of the household will take the hand censer and cense the icons and all of the members of the household. Often, in addition to the icon corner, a family will hang a small \\"portal icon\\" (usually of the Virgin and Christ Child) by the door, which is venerated by family and guests whenever going in or out of the house.

It lies 45 km (28 mi) north of the Federal District (Distrito Federal) in the northeastern part of the state of M√©xico, and is part of the Greater Mexico City urban area. During the colonial period the area's name had a number of variations, including Teohuilloyocan, Teohuilloyucan, Theoloyucan, Teoloyucan Coaquileque and Tehuilloyocan. The name comes from Nahuatl meaning place of glass or place of crystal rock. The city Treaty of Teoloyucan According to the Mendocino Codex, the settlement is mentioned as Itzcoatl conquered this area, meaning it existed prior to 1436, probably owing its importance to its proximity to Cuautitl√°n. After the Spanish Conquest, in 1565, the area and its people were entrusted to Alonso de √Åvila Alvarado. The Franciscans came a year later to evangelize. In 1570 the town was described as having four principal districts divided into 8 neighborhoods each, indicating the area was already well-organized with a population of over 1,000 people, half of whom were Mexica and the other half Otomi. The population of the city as of 2010 was 63,115. The city has two notable churches from the 17th century, the Church of Santa Cruz and the Church of San Juan. There are also plans to establish the Museo Comunitario de Teoloyucan (Community Museum of Teoloyucan). The city's patron saint is San Antonio de Padua. The Magnetic Observatory of Teoloyucan was originally established in the School of Mining in Mexico City in the 18th century by Antonio Alzate and Alexander von Humboldt. In 1903, it was moved to Cuajimalpa then again to its current location in 1911 due to the development of the Mexico City metropolitan area. It was originally located in the town's municipal palace but when this building was remodeled in 1978, the observatory again moved to its current location next to the municipal cemetery at the town's edge. The municipality As municipal seat, the city of Teoloyucan has governing jurisdiction over the following communities: Acolco, Analco, Atzacoalco, Axalpa, Cuaxoxoca, Colonia Agricola de Santo Tomas, Hacienda de San Jos√© Puente Grande, La Era, San Bartolo, San Sebastian, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz del Monte, Santa Mar√≠a Caliacac, Santiago, San Juan, Santo Tomas, Tepanquiahuac, Tlatenco, Tlatilco and Zimapan. The total population of the municipality in 2010 was 63,115. The municipality was created shortly after the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821 and in the same year as the creation of the State of Mexico in 1825. In this municipality were signed the Teoloyucan Treaties during the Mexican revolution. The municipality borders with the municipalities of Coyotepec, Zumpango, Cuautitl√°n Izcalli, Cuautitl√°n, Melchor Ocampo, Jaltenco, Nextlalpan, Coyotepec and Tepotzotl√°n. It has a territory of 31.52 km¬≤. While agriculture and livestock raising are still important economic activities, industrialization has begun in this area. Among the products manufactured are: packaged food, textiles, paper products, petroleum and plastic products, as well as machinery and metal parts. nuevo presidente :Gerardo Liceaga 2009-2012 References Category:Populated places in the State of Mexico Category:Municipalities of the State of Mexico ","title":"Teoloyucan"},{"id":"10340580","title":"Trilogy (ATB album)"},{"id":"10340627","text":"Takahiro Momiyama (Á±æÂ±±È´òÂ∫É), known as jamzvillage, is a Japanese singer and solo unit.

Career  Moschella received a bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia in 1990. Following graduation, he spent seven years in a variety of positions in the office of Congressman Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), while attending George Mason University Law School in the evenings. From 1997 to 2003, he held a number of positions on Capitol Hill, including serving as Counsel to the House Committee on Government Reform, General Counsel to the House Committee on Rules, Chief Investigative Counsel to the House Committee on the Judiciary from 1999 to 2001, and Chief Legislative Counsel and Parliamentarian to the House Committee on the Judiciary. In 2003, he was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as United States Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs, and he was approved by the Senate on May 9, 2003. On October 2, 2006, Moschella was named Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General succeeding William W. Mercer, who was nominated in early September to serve as Associate Attorney General. Controversies Moschella was directly involved in making changes to the Patriot Act that allowed interim US Attorneys to serve indefinitely. On March 6, 2007, Moschella testified to the House Judiciary Committee that all the US attorneys were fired for performance-related reasons, although he acknowledged that none of the attorneys were originally told why they had been fired. He also testified that the White House had no involvement in the firings of US Attorneys, testimony that was later shown to be incorrect by emails that were subsequently released. However, the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Justice, after an exhaustive investigation, found that \\"Moschella did not know that his testimony . . . was inaccurate. Moschella only reiterated publicly what he had been told about these issues and what [Deputy Attorney General] McNulty had previously told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\" The IG stated on page 356 of its report: \\"Under these circumstances, we concluded that Moschella's inaccurate testminony was not his fault and that he should not be criticized for it.\\"An Investigation into the Removal of Nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006, Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice, 356, (September 2008) (http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0809a/final.pdf).

Affectionately known as the \\"Swamp Fox\\", Patterson was a premiership ruckman with the Richmond Football Club in 1967, and also captain/coach of the 1972 Australian Champions, the North Adelaide Football Club. Richmond Patterson played for the Richmond Football Club between 1959 and 1969. When first choice ruck Neville Crowe was suspended for the 1967 grand final Patterson stepped up brilliantly to compete with legendary ruckman Polly Farmer and made a major contribution to Richmond's 9-point victory. North Adelaide In 1970 Patterson joined the North Adelaide Football Club as captain/coach with great success, hardening a champion side and leading the Roosters to SANFL premierships in 1971 and 1972. In 1972 he also led North Adelaide to national triumph in the Australian Championship, sealed with a 1-point victory over the Carlton Football Club. After 1973 he retired as a player after a career of 18 years but remained as North Adelaide's coach until 1977. St Kilda He returned to the VFL as coach of St Kilda from 1978 until Round 2 of 1980. St Kilda collected the wooden spoon for the third time in three years in 1979. Former player and trucking millionaire Lindsay Fox had been brought into the club, as president, in 1979.

At the start of a race or on a turn, streamline form is used, usually along with a dolphin kick or flutter kick, to create the least amount of resistance to help the swimmer propel as far as they can. Many factors contribute to the perfect streamline form and mastering this method increases a swimmer‚Äôs speed. Streamline is one of the key fundamentals to mastering any stroke. Technique The streamline position consists of a person placing hand over hand, fingers over fingers and raising their arms above their head so the biceps are tucked close to the ears. The belly is sucked back to decrease curvature of the spine in the lower back and the swimmer‚Äôs head is brought back to ensure that neck is in line with the spine McIntyre, Erin E., and Noshir Langrana. ‚ÄúVelocity Profile in Streamline Swimming.‚Äù The Rutgers Scholar:An Electronic Bulletin of Undergraduate Research 5 (2003): n. pag. Web. 7 November 2011. Pinching the shoulder blades together is helpful in aligning the spine to straighten out the back. Legs are straight and feet are pointed. In theory, a perfect, straight line will be made down the backside of a swimmer from their head to their feet. The body should be on a horizontal plane under the water, with the legs kicking straight from the thighs and hips, not the knees. A great deal of flexibility is usually needed to reach the goal of a perfect streamline, particularly flexibility of the shoulders. Kicking in the streamline position underwater can be substantially faster than swimming any of the other aquatic strokes, competitive or otherwise. For this reason, competitive swimmers often try to kick in a streamline position off a wall or the starting block for as long as they can be underwater before coming up for their first stroke. This is why many swimmers spend a lot of time perfecting the form and technique of streamline. Hydrodynamics and Speed There are three main resistances caused by drag on a swimmer which are caused from friction, form, and wave-making forces. The most detrimental force to streamline would be the resistance caused by form.McIntyre, Erin E., and Noshir Langrana. ‚ÄúVelocity Profile in Streamline Swimming.‚Äù The Rutgers Scholar:An Electronic Bulletin of Undergraduate Research 5 (2003): n. pag. Web. 7 November 2011. Bad form will cause more drag on a body in water (resistance) resulting in more work needing to be done to cover the same amount of distance. The amount of resistance on an object can be determined by the formula, :R=1/2 DpAv^2 D is the constant for the viscosity of the fluid, p is the density of the water, A is the surface area of the body traveling through the water, and v is the velocity of the body. Because the velocity is squared, the resistance will be exponentially affected by the value of velocity, which is why it is important to minimize the surface area as much as possible. Minimizing surface area is directly proportional to technique.Koff, Tara, Eddy Matkovich, and Kristin McPhillips. ‚ÄúResistance, Drag, and Hydrodynamics.‚Äù The Physics of Swimming. University of North Carolina. 15 April. 2004. Web. 7 November 2011. Timing in the transition from the glide to the kick is crucial for a swimmer to keep up their momentum. Switching to the kick too early will cause an increase in resistance. A transition that is performed too late will result in loss of speed due to the decrease in momentum, resulting in a waste of energy while returning to race speed.Lyttle, Andrew D., Brian A. Blanksby, Bruce C. Elliott, and David G. Lloyd. ‚ÄúNet Forces During Tethered Simulation of Underwater Streamlined Gliding and Kicking Techniques of the Freestyle Turn.‚Äù Journal of Sports Sciences 18.10 (2000): 801-807. Web. With all aspects of streamline brought together, it makes it the most hydrodynamic position one can assume in the water. Competition and Rules Streamline position is mostly used at the start of the race once a swimmer dives into the water off of the blocks. It is most common for the swimmer to dive into the water head first with their arms above their head and assume the streamline form at entry. The other common occurrence of streamline in a competitive race is after a swimmer completes a flip turn and pushes off of the wall. Once they have completely turned over to the opposing direction, the swimmer will then get into streamline position and push off of the wall to maximize the distance and speed out of the turn. Streamline position is the basis of the spinal axis strokes, backstroke and freestyle, as well. A swimmer will try to maintain a straight back and legs to minimize drag during the stroke. The F√©d√©ration Internationale de Natation (F.I.N.A.), otherwise known as the International Swimming Federation, has strict rules on how and when streamline may be performed in competition. According to FINA, no swimmer may travel more than 15 meters (16.4 yards) off of a start or turn in the backstroke, butterfly and freestyle underwater.‚ÄúFINA 2011 Swimming Rulebook.‚Äù Federation Internationale de Natation. FINA, 2011. Web. 2 December 2011. Breaststroke is only allowed one complete arm stroke followed by a butterfly kick and breaststroke kick.‚ÄúFINA 2011 Swimming Rulebook.‚Äù Federation Internationale de Natation. FINA, 2011. Web. 2 December 2011. After fifteen meters, the swimmer must break the surface of the water. Streamline is to only be used in the first 15 meters due to the swimmers inability to remain underwater without disqualification. This rule applies to all races done in compliance with FINA rules whether it is short course or long course. Swimmers in a race will usually maintain the streamline form and perform a butterfly kick for the full fifteen meters due to the fact that there is less resistance than there is on top of the water due to the lack of drag created by waves.Jiskoot, J., and J.P. Clarys. ‚ÄúBody Resistance On and Under the Water Surface.‚Äù Swimming II. Ed. Jeon Lewillie and Jan P. Clarys. Baltimore, MD: University Park Press, 1975. 105-109. Print. There is no specified limit in this stroke, but, since the number of underwater strokes and kicks are regulated, this becomes a moot point to competitive swimming. It is not hydrodynamic to maintain this position past a certain distance, which is invariably less than the length of a short-course pool.

In 1888 he received his doctorate at the University of Leipzig, and as a young assistant worked under Robert Koch (1843-1910) at the Reich Health Office in Berlin. From 1894 he worked as a privat-docent of surgery in Leipzig, where in 1896 he became an associate professor.

It may have been a camel caravan station on the eastern branch of the ancient Incense Route, serving pilgrims and merchants travelling to Sinai or central Egypt. The Nabataean towns of the Negev were typically founded around the first century BC, conquered by Romans two centuries later, who garrisoned the site, and inhabited by Byzantine Christians from at latest the fourth century until the invasion and the Muslim conquest of Syria in the seventh century. Relatively few stones remain on the site because most were recycled into buildings in Gaza in the early 20th century.

He eventually followed Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia. After Dou was killed by Emperor Gaozu of Tang in 621 and his territory was taken by Tang, Liu rose to avenge Dou, and briefly recaptured Dou's territory, north of the Yellow River. He was then defeated, first by the Tang general Li Shimin (the eventual Emperor Taizong) and then Li Shimin's brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, and in 623, he was captured by his one-time subordinate Zhuge Dewei () and executed.  Service under Hao Xiaode, Li Mi, Wang Shichong, and Dou Jiande  Little is known about Liu Heita's background, and it is not known when he was born. He was from Zhangnan (Êº≥Âçó, in modern Handan, Hebei)‚Äîthe same county as Dou Jiande‚Äîand was said to be brave and quick in reaction from his youth. He was also said to favor drinking and gambling, much to his father's and brothers' dismay. He became friendly with Dou, and whenever he lacked money, Dou would support him. He eventually joined agrarian rebels rising against Sui Dynasty rule, and he initially followed Hao Xiaode (), and then after Hao joined Li Mi's forces, served under Li. After Li was defeated by Wang Shichong, then a Sui general, in 618, as Wang knew of Liu's ferocity, he made Liu a cavalry officer, but he thought little of Wang's actions, and often secretly laughed at Wang. In 619, Liu was serving in the army of Wang's newly established state of Zheng (as Wang had the final Sui emperor, Yang Tong, yield the throne to him earlier that year), defending Xinxiang (Êñ∞ÈÑâ, in modern Xinxiang, Henan), when he was captured by Li Shiji, a Tang Dynasty general who had been forced to submit to and serve Dou's state of Xia. Dou made Liu a general and created him the Duke of Handong. He often had Liu command guerilla forces to make surprise attacks, and sometimes covertly entering enemy territory for intelligence purposes. It was said that Liu won many victories under Dou.  Uprising against Tang  In 621, with Wang Shichong's state of Zheng under attack by the Tang general Li Shimin the Prince of Qin (the eventual Emperor Taizong) and in desperate straits, Dou Jiande believed that if Zheng were destroyed by Tang, his own Xia state would be cornered. He therefore launched his army, seeking to save Zheng's capital Luoyang. Li Shimin engaged him at the Battle of Hulao, and Dou was captured. Wang then surrendered. The Xia forces considered continuing to resist, but under the leadership of the official Qi Shanxing (), they surrendered Xia territory to Tang. Map showing major uprisings and rebellions in the last years of Sui dynasty. However, subsequently, Dou was executed by Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Shimin's father). The former Xia generals and officials, who had returned to civilian life but who had been often harassed by Tang officials and worried that they would also be executed, gathered secretly and considered rising against Tang rule. After they, led by Gao Yaxian (), were informed by fortunetellers that their leader should be someone named Liu, they first offered their leadership to the general Liu Ya (), who refused (and was then killed by them). They instead offered the leadership to Liu Heita, who was then retired and tending to his garden, and he accepted. In fall 621, they officially rose and captured Zhangnan. The former Xia soldiers gradually came out of retirement and joined him, and Liu offered sacrifices to Dou's spirit, declaring that the Xia forces had risen to avenge him. His uprising was echoed by another agrarian leader, Xu Yuanlang, who had submitted to Tang but by now was nominally submitting to him. Tang's emperor Gaozu initially sent his cousin Li Shentong () the Prince of Huai'an against Liu, in conjunction with the Tang official Li Yi the Prince of Yan. Liu defeated Li Shentong, however, at Raoyang (È•íÈôΩ, in modern Hengshui, Hebei). Liu then defeated Li Yi as well, and Liu's fame spread through the region. He also entered into an alliance with another agrarian leader, Gao Kaidao the Prince of Yan, as well as the Eastern Turks (Dongtujue). Around the new year 622, Liu defeated Li Xiaochang (ÊùéÂ≠ùÂ∏∏, the son of a cousin of Emperor Gaozu) and Li Shiji as well, and recovered all of former Xia territory‚Äîthe region north of the Yellow River. Emperor Gaozu, now realizing that Liu was a major threat, decided to send Li Shimin and another son, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, to attack Liu. Meanwhile, in spring 622, Liu claimed the title of Prince of Handong. He organized his government in the same manner Dou did, retaining most of former Xia officials and generals. Historians commented that he was even more fierce and resolute in military actions than Dou. He set his capital at Mingzhou (now Guangfu), the same location as Dou's capital.  Defeat and death  Li Shimin arrived from the south as Liu was besieging Quzhou. Li Yi was coming from the north and the two Tang generals planned to capture the northern road from the Yellow River through Mingzhou to Yuzhou (Beijing), combining their forces and isolating the rebels from their Turkish allies. Liu split his forces. He was able to capture Luo Shixin () and, when Luo refused to join the rebels, had him executed. The other wing of his forces were defeated by Li Yi. Eventually, the Tang and Handong forces stalemated across the Ming River for more than 60 days. Both sides tried to attack each other, without success. Meanwhile, Li Shimin set up a dam upstream on the Ming River. When Liu attacked, Li Shimin had the dam destroyed, and much of the Handong army was drowned. Liu was able to flee with his general Wang Xiaohu (), but Handong defenses otherwise collapsed. Liu fled to the Eastern Turks (Dongtujue), and Handong territory fell into Tang hands. In summer 622, Liu, with Turkish reinforcements, tried to return to the region. Li Yi was unable to stop him. With Li Shimin having already returned to Chang'an at that point, Emperor Gaozu sent another son of a cousin, Li Daoxuan () the Prince of Huaiyang, to attack Liu, along with Li Yuanji. However, Liu's army won battle after battle, and in winter 622, Liu engaged Li Daoxuan at Xiabo (‰∏ãÂçö, in modern Hengshui), defeating and killing Li Daoxuan. Within half a month, Liu again recovered all of former Xia territory. Li Yuanji feared his power and hesitated at engaging him. Meanwhile, Emperor Gaozu's oldest son, Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, was by now in an intense rivalry with Li Shimin, as he feared that Li Shimin had the intent to seize the throne for himself rather than yielding to Li Jiancheng as the older brother. When Emperor Gaozu considered sending Li Shimin again, Li Jiancheng, at the suggestion of his staff members Wang Gui and Wei Zheng, volunteered. Emperor Gaozu therefore sent him. Meanwhile, Liu's forces became bogged down while sieging Tang's Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan as well), and when Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji arrived, Liu's forces ran out of food supplies and collapsed. Liu was able to flee, but in spring 623, as his flight, with only about 100 guards, took him to Rao Prefecture (È•íÂ∑û, in modern Hengshui), his prefect of Rao Prefecture, Zhuge Dewei, welcomed him into the city and held a feast for him. In the middle of the feast, however, Zhuge ambushed him and his guards, capturing them and delivering them to Li Jiancheng. Li Jiancheng had Liu Heita and his brother Liu Shishan () executed in the marketplace of his former capital Mingzhou. Before his death, Liu Heita lamented: :I was tending my garden. It was those people led by Gao Yaxian who brought me to this point.  Notes References=CitationsBibliography= * .

He was formerly a partner at Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator. His attempt to broadcast his entire life at Justin.tv popularized the term \\"lifecasting\\". Kan also started a Reddit-style electronic music discovery platform, The Drop. He also contributes to the technology news site TechCrunch and co-founded Kiko Software, an Ajax based online calendar, with Emmett Shear. Kan graduated from Yale University in 2005 with degrees in physics and philosophy.  Justin.tv  In 2007, Justin Kan and partners Emmett Shear, Michael Seibel and Kyle Vogt started Justin.tv, a 24‚Äì7 live video feed of Kan's life, broadcast via a webcam attached to his head. Kan's \\"lifecasting\\" lasted about eight months. The novelty of Kan's concept attracted media attention, and resulting interviews with him included one by Ann Curry on the Today Show. Viewers accompanied Kan as he walked the streets of San Francisco, sometimes involved in both pre-planned events (trapeze lesson, dance lesson) and spontaneous situations (being invited into the local Scientology center by a sidewalk recruiter). Afterward, the company transitioned to providing a live video platform so anyone could publish a live video stream. Justin.tv, the platform, launched in 2007 and was one of the largest live video platforms in the world with more than 30 million unique users every month. Justin.tv was closed on August 5, 2014, in an effort to focus further on Justin.tv's parent company, Twitch.  Twitch  After Justin.tv launched in 2007, the site quickly began building subject-specific content categories like Social, Tech, Sports, Entertainment, News & Events, Gaming and others. Gaming, in particular, grew very fast and became the most popular content on the site. The company then decided to spin off the gaming content under a separate brand at a separate site. They named it TwitchTV, inspired by the term twitch gameplay. It launched officially in public beta on June 6, 2011. Twitch was acquired by Amazon.com in August 2014 for $970 million.  Socialcam  Socialcam launched March 7, 2011, was bought by Autodesk July 17, 2012 for $60 million and was ended by Autodesk October 28, 2015. Socialcam was a mobile social video application for iPhone and Android that allowed users to capture and share video online and on mobile, as well as via Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. At one point, the application eclipsed 2 million downloads and continued to add to its features list, most notably with the addition of video filters.  Exec  Justin Kan launched Exec on February 29, 2012, a new service to allow anyone to outsource anything you want for $25/hour. Exec was co-founded with his brother Daniel Kan, former head of UserVoice business development, and Stanford graduate Amir Ghazvinian. Exec was purchased by Handybook, a company founded by Oisin Hanrahan, Umang Dua, Ignacio Leonhardt, and Weina Scott, in an all-stock transaction in January 2014.  Y Combinator  Kan was a member of the first batch of YC-funded startups in 2005 for Kiko Calendar, and was funded by YC again for Justin.tv and Exec. Kan became a partner at Y Combinator in March 2014, where he offered advice to the new startups in each batch. In March 2017, Kan left Y Combinator to start his own incubator, Zero-F.  The Drop  The Drop is a Reddit-style electronic music discovery platform that launched early 2015. Users can post and up-vote community curated and sourced tracks. It was founded by Kan and his college friend Ranidu Lankage.  Atrium  Inspired by his frustration at being a power user of legal services, Kan publicly launched Atrium in 2017 with the vision of building a technology-first law firm focused on offering legal services and fundraising advice for startups powered by machine learning. Kan raised $10.5 million in an initial \\"party\\" round of investment led by General Catalyst In September 2018, Kan raised a $65 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. At that time, Andrew Chen, Marc Andreessen and Michael Seibel joined the Atrium board of directors. Atrium has closed operations from March 2020.

It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required. However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system. The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas. Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum. It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum consolidation is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.

September 1967: The United States supplies 5.545 kg of enriched uranium, of which 5.165 kg contain fissile isotopes for fuel in a research reactor. The United States also supplies 112 g of plutonium, of which 104 g are fissile isotopes, for use as start-up sources for research reactor. July 1968: Iran signs the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratifies it. It goes into effect on March 5, 1970. 1970s: Under the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, plans are made to construct up to 20 nuclear power stations across the country with U.S. support and backing. Numerous contracts are signed with various Western firms, and the German firm Kraftwerk Union (a subsidiary of Siemens AG) begins construction on the Bushehr power plant in 1974. 1974: the Atomic Energy Act of Iran was promulgated. The Act covers the activities for which the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran was established at that period. These activities included using atomic energy and radiation in industry, agriculture and service industries, setting up atomic power stations and desalination factories, producing source materials needed in atomic industries. This creates the scientific and technical infrastructure required for carrying out the said projects, as well as co-ordinating and supervising all matters pertaining to atomic energy in the country. 1974: The Shah lent $1 billion to the French Atomic Energy Commission to help build the Eurodif uranium processing company in Europe. In exchange, Iran received rights to 10% of the enriched uranium product, a right Iran never exercised. After a bitter legal dispute, the loan was repaid in 1991.Oliver Meier.

It would rally the Iranian public around an otherwise unpopular regime, inflame anti-American anger around the Muslim world, and jeopardise the already fragile U.S. position in Iraq.

A native of Cheruthazham in Kannur taluk of Kannur district in North Malabar, Kerala he was initiated into Kathakali in his early teenage years under the tutelage of Guru Chandu Panikker. By 19, he got noticed by Kerala Kalamandalam co-founder, poet Vallathol Narayana Menon, and inducted Krishnan Nair into his institute, then near Mulankunnathukavu, north of Thrissur in central Kerala. It was there that Krishnan Nair was trained under gurus of varied style‚Äîlike Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon, Thakazhi Kunchu Kurup, Kavalappara Narayanan Nair and Mani Madhava Chakyar. Krishnan Nair had his higher studies on Rasa-abhinaya (facial emotions which stressed on eye exercises) from the celebrated Kudiyattam maestro Natyacharya MƒÅni MƒÅdhava ChƒÅkyƒÅr, who too won the Padma Shri.http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/08/15/stories/2008081550640300.htm Krishnan Nair was deeply influenced by Shri. Chakyar.Malayalam Literary Survey - Volume 13, Kerala Sahitya Akademi, 1991 With his calibre to perform any challenging role and a flexible mindset that prompted him to occasionally do minor roles (with some new elements), Krishnan Nair was probably the pioneering Kathakali artiste who was a hardcore professional‚Äîin the sense that he was the arguably the first to dictate the rate for each of his performances. It was a watershed move in an art form that had huge feudal hangovers and its entailing element of servility that patrons expected from the artistes. Krishnan Nair had a penchant for realistic portrayal of characters and situations that made him more popular in the Travancore belt of south Kerala. In fact, his outlandish style had made him a less acknowledged master in central and north Kerala‚Äîthe very places that groomed his art in his early days. Krishnan Nair's powerful style won him admirers. Krishnan Nair, towards the second half of his life, had made Tripunithura near Kochi his home. The Hindu : In honour of the thespian couple He married Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma. The Malayalam actor, Kalasala Babu was his son. Krishnan Nair died on Indian Independence Day, 15 August 1990, aged 76.

After being a doujinshi artist from 1999 to 2000, she became an official manga artist in 2001. In addition to this, she has also illustrated a number of light novels. Biography Born in Hokkaido on October 23, she began her career in 1999 as a Houshin Engi doujinshi artist as well as doing fanart from popular series like Hikaru no Go, Shaman King and Yami no Matsuei. Her works were predominantly BL-related. Finally she got her break when her first original series, Harlem Beat wa Yoake Made was serialized in Kadokawa's Monthly Asuka. After a well received debut, the company decided to publish the series into an actual volume.Kadokawa: Harlem Beat wa Yoake Made After that, she went on to make another of her well-known series: Last Client which was serialized in Biblos's BexBoy Magazine in 2002. In that same year she got Wild Rock published by Biblos (it went straight to manga form; not serialized). Since then she has published roughly nine distinctive titles through various publishing companies and has been the illustrator of a number of light novels by various authors, and other media. She filed a lawsuit against Kayono in 2004. The lawsuit was founded on Takashima's belief that Kayono had directly traced over her work Wild Rock, and used it for her own manga.Kayono Kenshou The judge threw out the case (resulting in Takashima losing). Takashima decided to go on hiatus, leaving all of her series unfinished. She resumed work in 2007 with the fourth installment of Harlem Beat wa Yoake Made. Since then, she has finished the series, Wild Rock and Man's Best Friend have been reprinted, and she did a pinup of Chris (from her series Last Client, which had been left on hiatus) in Biblos's GOLD magazine. She also changed websites. Takashima was more active on her blog in 2011,maxmaximum: Archives and in her December 10 entry, stated that she \\"took a break\\" that she felt was necessary and that she \\"plans to work hard\\" in the new year.maxmaximum: December 10th Entry Then this blog was abandoned. In 2013, she became the illustrator for Mirage of Blaze's prequel light novels by Kuwabara Mizuna, titled Mirage of Blaze: The Showa Era Chapters. The 11 Volumes finished publication in 2017, though her art was used for the promotional material for the stage playTrifle Entertainment's Website . This is the longest, single series light novel she's worked on thus far. In 2014, she also revitalized her Cocolog Blog, but under a new name.

She started an Instagram account in February 2016 where she posted various updates or notices about minor illustration work she was doing, or fan art and concept art.Takashima's Instagram Larger resolution versions of all of the posts can be found on her previously mentioned Cocolog blog. In 2018, she seemed to finally end her hiatus with a new manga titled, Whiskers and Tails with KannadukiTakashima's Instagram . It is being serialized in Biblos's BexBoy Gold Magazine. In June 2019, she made a post to her blog advertising the latest chapter of Whiskers and Tails, and mentioned that she'd been considering continuing one of her old works.Blog Post from June 2019 This was exciting news for fans as several of her unfinished works (Last Client, Hakobunjaa, etc.) were very popular before her hiatus and their subsequent discontinuation.

It has exclusive jurisdiction in terms of most mental health issues, although it may share jurisdiction on some issue with other courts, such as the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. The tribunal came into existence in 1998 and it is located on Level 3, 9‚Äì11 Cavenagh Street, Darwin. Constitution The tribunal is established under the Mental Health & Related Services Act (NT). The act gives the tribunal a wide range of powers to deal with the treatment and care of people with a mental illness. The Administrator of the Northern Territory may appoint members to the tribunal. To be appointed, a person must be either: * a legal practitioner who has not less than 5 years experience as a solicitor or barrister; or * a medical practitioner; or *a person who has a special interest or expertise in mental illness or mental disturbances. From those members, the Administrator may appoint one to be the president of the tribunal. At present there is no permanent or full-time president of the tribunal.Annual Report 2005 p5 Most legal members are either current or retired stipendiary magistrates appointed in the territory. All medical members are interstate based psychiatrists who also undertake similar tribunal duties in their state. As a result, all sittings involve video or telephone conferencing.Annual Report 2005, p5 Functions of the tribunal The tribunal is required to conduct period reviews of the admission and treatment of involuntary or voluntary patients into institutions. It also decides applications to administer non-standard treatments in respect of patients. It also hears appeals against decisions concerning admission or treatment and to review decisions to withhold information from patients. The tribunal may also make orders for the transfer of persons to treatment facilities in other Australian states or territories. Work of the tribunal The Tribunal sits as a three-member panel. The legal member presides and decides any legal issues that may arise. The other members of the panel consist of the medical member and the community member. The tribunal sits in Darwin and Alice Springs on a weekly basis. Tribunal hearings for remote locations may be held by video or telephone conferencing. Tribunal hearings usually take place on Wednesdays in Darwin and on Fridays in Alice Springs. In 2006, the workload of the tribunal decreased from 208 in 2005 to 191 new patients. Appeals In certain circumstances, there may be an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory concerning the decisions of the tribunal.

Raw milk makes up a small proportion of US general population milk consumption. However, some claim the demand for raw milk has \\"considerably increased in recent years\\". Raw milk advocates claim a variety of health benefits attributable to untreated dairy products; government officials and scientific researchers stress that there are substantial food safety risks associated with raw milk, and that claims of health benefits provided by raw milk are unsupported by scientific evidence.  Homogenization  Unprocessed milk consists of globules of milk fat suspended in a watery base containing dissolved proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. If the globules are large enough, as with unprocessed milk from cows, the fat globules float upwards until they form a distinct cream layer at the top. Some animals, such as goats, produce smaller fat globules that remain mixed unless mechanically separated by centrifugation. Homogenization is a process that reduces the size of fat globules by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing turbulence that breaks up the larger fat globules so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of homogenization is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to shake or stir the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the shelf-life of the product. Those opposed to homogenization argue that decreasing the size of fat globules may have unhealthy effects, including allowing steroid and protein hormones to bypass normal digestion and increase their levels in the body. Concerns that uptake of the protein xanthine oxidase is increased by homogenization, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), were raised in the 1970s. Subsequent research \\"failed to substantiate, and in many cases has refuted\\" a plausible effect of xanthine oxidase from homogenized milk on cardiovascular disease. Scientific studies are somewhat limited but do not currently support claims that milk homogenization affects the development of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, milk allergy and milk intolerance, Type I diabetes or Type II diabetes.  Pasteurization  Pasteurization is a sanitation process in which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), brucellosis (Brucella), campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter), salmonellosis (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., Escherichia coli O157:H7). Pasteurization may not kill some resistant bacteria, which can eventually cause souring and spoilage of fresh milk. UHT pasteurization (Ultra High Temperature) is a more extreme form of pasteurization heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill spoilage organisms also. Pasteurization is widely accepted to improve the safety of milk products by reducing the exposure to pathogens. Opponents of pasteurization argue that unpasteurized milk has benefits associated with superior taste, nutritional qualities and certain health benefits over pasteurized milk. While pasteurization of milk kills off bacterial pathogens, other bacteria species with possible health benefits are also destroyed. Pasteurization of cow's milk destroys any potential pathogens and increases the shelf life,. During pasteurization, however, these lactic acid bacteria are mostly destroyed. A 2009 systematic review of the food safety of unpasteurized milk concluded that science-based data to substantiate claims of health benefits \\"are lacking or do not exist\\" and the risks associated with disease outbreaks as a result of raw milk consumption are \\"considerably higher\\". =History= Pasteurization was first used in the United States in the 1890s after the discovery of germ theory to control the hazards of highly contagious bacterial diseases, including bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, that could be easily transmitted to humans through the drinking of raw milk. Initially after the scientific discovery of bacteria, no product testing was available to determine if a farmer's milk was safe or infected, so all milk had to be treated as potentially contagious. After the first test was developed, some farmers actively worked to prevent their infected animals from being killed and removed from food production, or would falsify the test results so that their animals would appear to be free of infection. In the United States, milk pasteurization became \\"widespread\\" in the 1920s and it was considered \\"one of the major breakthroughs in public health\\".\\"Got Raw Milk?\\", Boston Globe, March 23, 2008 In 1924, \\"Grade A Pasteurization\\" became recommended federal policy, but interstate commerce of unpasteurized dairy products was only limited via federal legislation in 1987. =Legal status= In 2009, 29 U.S. states allowed sales of raw milk in some form. In other parts of the world, raw milk can often be bought directly from the farmer. Arizona, Utah, California and Washington allow raw milk sales in retail stores with appropriate warning labeling. As of May 2010, Massachusetts only allows direct sales from farm to consumer, resulting in \\"buying clubs\\" where consumers pool transportation resources to obtain raw milk more conveniently. In April 2013, the State of North Dakota passed a law that authorizes the use of herd shares.http://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/63-2013/documents/13-8013-05000.pdf?20130607080901 In late 2007, the debate received media attention in California, where limits on the bacterial counts legally allowed in commercial raw milk came up for legislative review.\\"Bid in Assembly to repeal tough new raw milk standard\\", San Francisco Chronicle, January 16, 2008 Reuters named the raw milk debate as first on a list of the top eight health issues of 2008.\\"Top Health Issues of 2008\\", Reuters, December 20, 2007 The FDA has also offered financial assistance to state departments of health to help reduce raw milk consumption. = Health effects of pasteurized milk = Pasteurization is credited with dramatically reducing pathogens found in milk. This improves the shelf-life and safety of the processed milk. Advocates of drinking raw milk claim various health benefits they attribute to raw milk that are lost in the pasteurization process,\\"Should This Milk Be Legal?\\", New York Times, August 8, 2007 and claim that raw milk can be produced as hygienically as pasteurized milk.Raw Milk and Raw Milk Products: Safety, Health, Economic, and Legal Issues, Weston A. Price Foundation Raw milk advocates may go as far as to claim that untreated milk is a \\"miracle cure\\" for illnesses such as asthma or gastrointestinal disorders. A 2006 systematic review of infections associated with raw milk contends that pasteurized milk is substantially safer than raw milk, and comparably nutritious to raw milk, therefore there is no scientific reason for choosing raw milk products. Similarly, a recent review authored by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain and experts from Belgian universities and institutions concluded that \\"raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered organoleptic [flavor] profile, heating (in particularly ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption.\\" Pasteurization opponents say that raw milk contains bacteria beneficial to the human digestive system,Abstracts on the Effect of Pasteurization on the Nutritional Value of Milk, Weston A. Price Foundation but pasteurization is not selective and affects all bacteria whether beneficial or infectious. These bacteria include species considered to be probiotics, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, useful for the culturing of yogurt and cheese. Fermented milk products with levels of L. acidophilus significantly higher than those found in raw milk have been associated with decreased incidence of pediatric diarrhea, decreased levels of toxic amines in the blood of dialysis patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth, aided lactose digestion in lactose-intolerant subjects, and a reduction in coronary heart disease risks. However, food scientists and FDA officials maintain that such \\"good bacteria\\" can be found in pasteurized products, including yogurt,\\"The history of raw milk\\", Matthew DeFour, Wisconsin State Journal, December 5, 2009 and argue that the destruction of pathogens far outweighs any proposed benefit to keeping the beneficial microbes alive. Pathogens and public health concerns According to a 2009 review, milkborne disease outbreaks made up approximately 25% of all food and water contamination disease outbreaks in 1938; pasteurization is largely credited for a dramatic decrease in milkborne disease outbreaks, which made up less than 1% of food and water contamination disease outbreaks by 2005. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 300 people in the United States got sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk in 2001, and nearly 200 became ill from these products in 2002. \\"Drinking raw milk or eating raw milk products is like playing Russian roulette with your health,\\" says John Sheehan, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Division of Dairy and Egg Safety. \\"We see a number of cases of food-borne illness every year related to the consumption of raw milk.\\" In 2006, the California Department of Food and Agriculture temporarily quarantined milk and cream from Organic Pastures, California's largest raw milk producer, after four children were stricken with E. coli O157:H7 bacterial illness. The department determined that the common link in all four cases \\"was consumption of raw milk or raw colostrum from Organic Pastures in the week prior to symptom onset.\\"\\"CDFA Lifts Quarantine of Organic Pastures Raw Milk and Cream,\\" California Department of Food and Agriculture, September 2006 Milk collected or stored in unsanitary conditions may harbor a host of disease-causing organisms (pathogens), such as tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), the bacteria Campylobacter (Campylobacteriosis), Escherichia E. coli O157:H7), Listeria (Listeriosis), Salmonella (Salmonellosis), Yersinia (Yersinia enterocolitica), and Brucella (Brucellosis). Pasteurization consistently removes all of these pathogens, though they can be reintroduced if the product is handled carelessly. Thus dairy farms that pasteurize their milk can have unsanitary facilities without the attendant outbreaks of disease that would occur if a raw milk dairy kept its herds in similar unsanitary conditions. People with weakened immune systems, such as elderly, children, and those with certain diseases or conditions, are most at risk for severe infections from pathogens that can contaminate raw milk. In pregnant women, Listeria monocytogenes-caused illness can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or illness or death of a newborn infant, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection has been linked to hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that can cause kidney failure and death. Other groups, such as the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and American Academy of Pediatrics, also warn that raw milk is dangerous, especially for children. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) cite numerous cases of serious or fatal infections caused by raw milk, with E. coli O157:H7 being the most important because it can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a life-threatening condition. In a CDC report, numerous cases were traced to raw milk from a cow-share program in Cowlitz County, Washington. After five children were hospitalized, a court order was issued to bring the farm into compliance.\\"Escherichia coli O157:H7 Infection Associated with Drinking Raw Milk ‚Äì Washington and Oregon, November‚ÄìDecember 2005\\". Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, March 2, 2007, 56(08);165‚Äì167 In 2007, Kansas State University published a list of outbreaksList of Raw Milk Outbreaks associated with consuming raw milk or dairy products and an article about the investigation of raw milk outbreaks. The Weston A. Price Foundation has been active in promoting raw milk with its \\"Real Milk\\" campaign. The organization claims that of 15 milkborne disease outbreaks cited by the FDA, not a single one demonstrated that pasteurization would have fixed the problem, that 93% lacked either a valid statistical correlation with raw milk or a positive sample, and half lacked both; they further claimed that, even with the FDA's numbers, raw milk was no more dangerous than deli meats.FDA rebuttal, Weston A. Price Foundation In response, the director of the FDA's division of plant- and dairy-food safety, John Sheehan, called the organization's claims on the health benefits and safety of raw milk \\"false, devoid of scientific support, and misleading to consumers\\".\\"A Clash Over Unpasteurized Milk Gets Raw\\", Wall Street Journal, March 30, 2010 In 2008, scientists discovered that raw milk contains more species of bacteria than previously thought, and identified Chryseobacterium oranimense as well as C. haifense and C. bovis, but the amount found in raw milk has not been proven harmful.EurekAlert. New bacteria discovered in raw milk. While causation has not been determined, researchers in 2015 found that 59% of people with breast cancer had bovine leukemia virus (BLV) in their breast cancer samples, compared to the virus being found in only 29% of tissue samples of people who had never had breast cancer. BLV is common, spread by blood and milk in cows, and has been found in 100% of bulk milk tanks in dairy operations with over 500 cows. Consuming unpasteurized milk or under cooked meats could be pathways for human exposure to BLV.Berkeley News. Virus in Cattle linked to Human Breast Cancer. In November 2017, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended medical treatment for anyone who had, within the previous six months, consumed raw milk products from Udder Milk, a New Jersey-based cooperative. An antibiotic resistant strain of Brucella abortus, which can cause the disease Brucellosis, was detected in at least one person who drank raw milk from the co-op. Nutrients in milk Advocates of drinking raw milk claim raw milk contains desirable substances, such as enzymes, that cannot survive the heating process and may be destroyed during pasteurization; specifically, immunoglobulins and the enzymes lipase and phosphatase, which are inactivated by heat, are believed to be beneficial. In contrast, food scientists and FDA officials assert that most \\"beneficial\\" enzymes survive pasteurization; that those few enzymes that are present in raw milk and denatured in pasteurized milk are ultimately degraded in the low pH environment of the stomach anyway; and that the enzymes present in milk are not used by humans to metabolize nutrients. Pasteurization does lead to decreased levels of several vitamins, but only approximately 0‚Äì10%. Research shows only very slight differences in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Raw milk contains very little vitamin D, which is added to processed milk. Protection against non-infectious disease Three studies have found a statistically significant inverse relationship between consumption of raw milk and asthma and allergies. However, all of these studies have been performed in children living on farms and living a farming lifestyle, rather than comparing urban children living typical urban lifestyles and with typical urban exposures who do or do not consume raw milk, so it is likely that other aspects of the overall urban vs. farming environment lifestyle play a role in these effects; for this reason, the overall phenomenon is termed the \\"farm effect.\\" In the largest of these studies, exposure to cows and straw as well as raw milk were associated with lower rates of asthma, and exposure to animal feed storage rooms and manure with lower rates of atopic dermatitis. A recent scientific review concluded that ‚Äúmost studies alluding to a possible protective effect of raw milk consumption do not contain any objective confirmation on the raw milk status or a direct comparison with heat-treated milk. Moreover, it seems that the observed increased resistance seems to be rather related to the exposure to a farm environment or to animals than to raw milk consumption.‚Äù =Sensory experiences of pasteurized and un-pasteurized products= Many raw milk consumers cite a preference for the taste of raw milk products.

These grades are typically related to a measurement known as the somatic cell count (SCC) and the bacteria plate count. Generally a lower somatic cell count indicates better animal health, while the bacteria plate count indicates improved equipment sanitation. Somatic cells originate only from inside the animal's udder, while bacteria are usually from external contamination, such as insufficient cleaning of the milk transport equipment or insufficient external cleansing of the cow‚Äôs udder and teats prior to milking. Milking equipment can also be accidentally knocked or kicked off an animal onto the floor, and contaminants on the barn floor can be sucked into the milk line by the system vacuum. A filter sock or filter disk in the pipeline prevents large particulate contaminants from entering the milk bulk tank, but cannot remove bacterial contamination once it has occurred. For example, as defined by the state of Indiana‚Äôs administrative code, Grade A milk shall meet the following standards:State of Indiana Administrative Code, Title 345 Indiana State Board of Animal Health, Article 8, Dairy Products, 345 IAC 8-2-3 Manufacturing grade dairy farms; construction; operation; sanitation, page 11 http://in.gov/legislative/iac/T03450/A00080.PDF > * The bacterial estimate classification shall be \\"acceptable\\". * The > bacteria count using the standard plate count, direct microscopic count, or > plate loop count methods shall be not more than one million (1,000,000) > Colony-forming units (cfu) of bacteria per milliliter. * The somatic cell > count shall be not more than one million (1,000,000) cfu cells per > milliliter. * The milk shall not contain drug residues. Milk not meeting > these standards shall be designated as undergrade. Undergrade milk may not > be sold for human consumption or processing into products for human > consumption. As established, these measurements are taken daily from the milk bulk tank and not from individual cows. This is because testing of individual animals at each milking would be expensive, but it also means that milk from a sick cow is diluted and averaged down by the healthy animals. Greater bulk tanks at very great commercial farms are accommodating of more sick animals in the herd, without the sick animals affecting the overall milk quality rating. As discussed in the paper Guidelines for Using the DHI Somatic Cell Count ProgramGuidelines for Using the DHI Somatic Cell Count Program, Author: G.M. Jones, Professor of Dairy Science and Extension Dairy Scientist, Milk Quality & Milking Management, Virginia Tech, Publication Number 404-228, posted March 1998 http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/dairy/404-228/404-228.pdf > * The results of many studies suggest that cows with SCC of less than > 200,000 are not likely to be infected with major mastitis pathogens, but > cows with SCC above 300,000 are probably infected (Smith, 1996). * Herds > with bulk tank SCC above 200,000 will have varying degrees of subclinical > mastitis present.

Bacteria in milk can come from sources other than the animal. Over time the milking pipeline and equipment can become coated with residues such as milkstone which are not removed by standard detergents and require periodic flushing of equipment with high strength corrosives. Automatic washing equipment for the bulk tank may not effectively clean all interior surfaces, and does not clean the exterior of the bulk tank at all. Some buyers award producers for having the lowest SCC but this does not also lead to an increased payment for the milk quality, so there is no incentive to strive for anything more than meeting the basic grade A SCC rating.

The primary threats to this endangered species are habitat loss and capture for the pet trade (now illegal).  Description  The Malagasy rainbow frog is a small, roundish, brightly coloured species with a distinctive white, orange‚Äìred, green and black pattern on the back, each area of which is clearly delineated. The skin on the back is very smooth, but that of the grey belly is a little bit rough. The snout is rounded, the eyes are prominent but the tympani are inconspicuous. The limbs are short and robust and the digits of the hand have large tips and the hind feet are webbed. Adapted for both underground and climbing lifestyles, the Malagasy rainbow frog has horny tubercles on the underside of the hind feet to help with burrowing, and claws on the forefeet for clinging to vertical canyon walls. With a snout‚Äìvent length of , females average larger and reach a larger maximum size than males which measure . Distribution and habitat This frog often spends time in holes or crevices in rocks The Malagasy rainbow frog is endemic to the Isalo Massif at an altitude of in the central part of southern Madagascar, including the Isalo National Park and areas south of it. Its primary habitat is narrow canyons where the conditions tend to be cool for the tropics, relatively dark (resulting in little or no vegetation) and very humid. The typical temperature in its habitat is , but overall varies from about . It shares its range with another colourful and endangered frog, the blue-legged mantella (Mantella expectata), which occurs in the same habitat but prefers more open, sun- exposed areas. The Malagasy rainbow frog digs into the sandy areas bordering the streams or spends its time in small holes or crevices in the rock walls. At night it may climb on the rock walls, reaching several meters high. Although rare outside its primary canyon habitat, it can also be found in open rocky areas, mostly in dry forest. Behaviour Tadpole with head in the sand, a typical position when feeding on detritus The Malagasy rainbow frog is an explosive breeder (meaning that the breeding season is short and begins suddenly) that breeds in groups in November‚ÄìDecember just after the first heavy rainfall in the early rainy season. A group often consists of a few tens of individuals and usually more males than females. Males call from rock walls or the surface of temporary pools and it is in these that the eggs are laid, which already hatch into tadpoles after about three days. The tadpoles have a stout oval body with flattened underside. They appear black in the daytime but turn brownish-grey at night. In the wild they are detritivores and filter feeders, although captives have been reared from Gosner stage 25 to near metamorphosis on fish food. They have the unusual habit of spending the day with their heads submerged in the sediment of the bottom, feeding on detritus, and their tails projecting at an angle. During the night the tadpoles swim around, apparently filter feeding particles from the open water. Many tadpoles are swept away by torrents during the rainy season and may complete their metamorphosis elsewhere. Recently metamorphosed young frogs are about half to one-third the size of adults, but otherwise similar. In addition to inactive dispersal of the tadpoles by water currents, adults may actively disperse, especially during cold weather. The species is quite short-lived, typically only reaching an age of 2 years. Conservation status The IUCN lists the Malagasy rainbow frog as \\"Endangered\\"; it was formerly (from 2004 to 2008) \\"Critically Endangered\\", but this was reduced when it was found to be more widespread than previously thought and locally common. Although it is common in some areas, it has a restricted range and its population is believed to be decreasing. The major threats are habitat loss and over-collection for the pet trade. Primary threats to the habitat are wood extraction, fire, overgrazing by livestock, mining and possibly disturbance by tourists. As recent as the 2000s (decade), thousands were captured every year for the pet trade. When added to CITES Appendix II, an export quota was introduced. By 2014, it had been lowered to 0 (zero), making export of wild-caught individuals illegal. There are indications that the snake Leioheterodon modestus possibly is an important natural predator of this frog.

Saig≈ç Takamori is sitting in the center. 1877 painting. The Seikanron (Japanese: ÂæÅÈüìË´ñ; ; \\"Advocacy of a punitive expedition to Korea\\") was a major political debate in Japan during 1873 regarding a punitive expedition against Korea. The Seikanron split the Meiji government and the restoration coalition that had been established against the bakufu, but resulted in a decision not to send a military expedition to Korea. Historical Background After the Meiji Restoration and the overthrow of the Shogunate in 1868, the newly formed Meiji government embarked on reforms to centralize and modernize Japan. The Imperial side did not pursue its objective to expel foreign interests from Japan instead adhering to the treaties signed during the bakumatsu period with the ultimate goal of revising them and building up the nation's strength by continuing with reforms begun under the shogunate. In foreign affairs, the government had taken steps to establish a foreign affairs bureau to take over Japan's external relations which was previously conducted by the bakufu. Although the shogunate had been overthrown, the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei an alliance of northeastern domains continued resistance to the new government. Enomoto Takeaki, a former shogunate naval officer, had taken control of eight of the best warships of the Sh≈çgun's navy and joined the northeastern alliance. After the defeat of the ≈åuetsu Reppan D≈çmei, he had fled farther north to Hokkaido where he occupied the city of Hakodate and set up the Republic of Ezo. In the spring of 1869, the central government began operations against the last stronghold of military opposition and in May 1869 opposition forces surrendered. Enomoto Takeaki's refusal to surrender and his escape to Hokkaido with a large part of former Tokugawa Navy's best warships embarrassed the Meiji government politically. The imperial side had to rely on considerable military assistance from the most powerful domains as the government did not have enough power, especially naval power, to defeat Enomoto on its own. Although the rebel forces in Hokkaido surrendered, the government's response to the rebellion demonstrated the need for a strong centralized government. Even before the incident the restoration leaders had realized the need for greater political, economic and military centralization. =Japanese attempts to establish relations with Korea= During the Edo period Japan's relationship and trade with Korea were conducted through intermediaries with the S≈ç family in Tsushima, A Japanese outpost, called the waegwan, was allowed to be maintained in Tongnae near Pusan. The traders were confined to the outpost and no Japanese were allowed to travel to the Korean capital at Seoul. The bureau of foreign affairs wanted to change these arrangements to one based on modern state-to-state relations. In late 1868, a member of the S≈ç daimy≈ç informed the Korean authorities that a new government had been established and an envoy would be sent from Japan. In 1869 the envoy from the Meiji government arrived in Korea carrying a letter requesting to establish a goodwill mission between the two countries; the letter contained the seal of the Meiji government rather than the seals authorized by the Korean Court for the S≈ç family to use. It also used the character ko (Áöá) rather than taikun (Â§ßÂêõ) to refer to the Japanese emperor. The Koreans only used this character to refer to the Chinese emperor and to the Koreans it implied ceremonial superiority to the Korean monarch which would make the Korean monarch a vassal or subject of the Japanese ruler. The Japanese were however just reacting to their domestic political situation where the Sh≈çgun had been replaced by the emperor. The Koreans remained in the sinocentric world where China was at the centre of interstate relations and as a result refused to receive the envoy. Unable to force the Koreans into accepting a new set of diplomatic symbols and practices, the Japanese began to change them unilaterally. To an extent, this was a consequence from the abolition of the domains in August 1871, whereby it meant that was simply no longer possible for the S≈ç family of Tsushima to act as intermediaries with the Koreans. Another, equally important factor was the appointment of Soejima Taneomi as the new minister of foreign affairs, who had briefly studied law at Nagasaki with Guido Verbeck. Soejima was familiar with international law and pursued a strong forward policy in East Asia, where he used the new international rules in his dealings with the Chinese and the Koreans and with the Westerners. During his tenure, the Japanese slowly began to transform the traditional framework of relations managed by the Tsushima domain into the foundation for the opening of trade and the establishment of \\"normal\\" interstate, diplomatic relations with Korea. Meiji politics The south western domains of Satsuma, Ch≈çshu, Tosa and Hizen were the backbone of the Meiji regime and that gave the government its power, authority and its money. The daimyo of these domains were still very much a factor, and the domain elders were jealous of their institutional and parochial interests. As a consequence, local and national loyalties were frequently at odds. =Political and structural reforms= Many in the restoration coalition had recognized the need for centralized authority and although the imperial side was victorious against the bakufu, the early Meiji government was weak and the leaders had to maintain their standing with their domains whose military forces was essential for whatever the government needed to achieve. Political divisions in the form of feudal domains, lord-vassal relations within the samurai elite and separation of social classes within Japanese society were major impediments to centralization. However, in Japan's historical memory there was an era of unification under a central government headed by the emperor and the Tokugawa years had spurred economic and cultural integration. For the Meiji regime it was also fortunate that personal relations had usually been established during the years that preceded the Restoration and by cooperation between the various domains during the military campaigns against the bakufu and hold-out domains, a high level of education and social skills also helped to lubricate and cement friendships between the member of the domains. =Abolition of the domains= In January 1869, the four south western domains of Satsuma, Choshu, Tosa, and Hizen had submitted a petition to the court stating that they be permitted to return their registers of their domains to the imperial government. By the time the court formally accepted the four-domain petition on July 25, 1869, and made it compulsory, most of the nearly three hundred domains had submitted similar requests. All daimy≈çs were now re-appointed governors (Chiji) of their domains, but without the privileges of hereditary succession. In return for surrendering their hereditary authority to the central government, they were also allowed to retain ten percent of the tax revenues for household expenses. As governors, the former daimy≈çs could name subordinates, but only if the subordinates met qualification levels established by the central government. The Return of the Registers (hanseki h≈çkan) was marked a first step toward centralization and the administrative unification of Japan. The Daimyos still retained much of their authority, but they now governed as national officers and not for themselves. In August 1871, the domains were fully abolished (haihan chiken) and replaced by prefectures. =Reform of government institutions= Another more important reform was the establishment of a much more powerful executive institution than had previously existed in the new government, the Dajokan. The top post, Minister of the Right (Udaijin), went to Sanj≈ç Sanetomi. Below him were three Great Councillors (Dainagon); these positions went initially to two Court nobles - Iwakura Tomomi and Tokudaiji Sanenori and one former daimyo Nabeshima Naomasa of Hizen. Nabeshima, withdrew after a year and died in early 1871, but two more Court nobles were appointed to this office in December 1869 and November 1870, respectively. Next came the Councillors (Sangi), all of whom were samurai: initially two - Soejima Taneomi of Hizen and Maebara Issei of Ch≈çshu, then four with the addition of ≈åkubo Toshimichi of Satsuma and Hirosawa Saneomi of Ch≈çshu. During the next two years the number of Sangi varied, from a minimum of two to a maximum of seven, and six other samurai held office at one time or another - Kido Koin of Ch≈çshu, ≈åkuma Shigenobu of Hizen, Saig≈ç Takamori of Satsuma, and Sasaki Takayuki, Saito Toshiyuki, and Itagaki Taisuke, all from Tosa. Under the Dajokan there were six departments or ministries that had been established: Civil Affairs (Mimbush≈ç), Finance (≈åkurash≈ç), War (Hy≈çbusho), Justice (Ky≈çbush≈ç), Imperial Household (Kunaish≈ç) and Foreign Affairs (Gaimush≈ç). They were usually headed by imperial princes, Court nobles, or daimyo, but generally it was the samurai deputies who had effective control. Another decree issued at the same time, brought Court nobles and Daimyos together in a single order of nobility, to be called kazoku which also divided the samurai into two broad segments, shizoku (gentry) and sotsu (foot-soldiers). This replaced the existing multiplicity of ranks and instituted a review of hereditary stipends, and also revised the regulations concerning local office and finance. =Tensions with the Samurai= Serious divisions emerged in the restoration coalition that had overthrown the Shogunate. Reforms enacted by the Meiji government such as the abolition of the domains led to resentment. Debates Saig≈ç Takamori and his supporters insisted that Japan confront Korea due to the latter's refusal to recognize the legitimacy of Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan, and insulting treatment meted out to Japanese envoys attempting to establish trade and diplomatic relations. The war party also saw the issue in Korea as an ideal opportunity to find meaningful employment for the thousands of out-of- work samurai, who had lost most of their income and social standing in the new Meiji social and economic order. These samurai posed a threat to the government, and as a samurai himself Saig≈ç sympathized with their situation. According to orthodoxy, \\"Saig≈ç himself volunteered to go to Korea as a special envoy, inviting an assassination attempt that would provide justification, if any were needed, for a punitive expedition.\\"Hunter, P.43. However Saig≈ç's statement was an attempt to win over the support of Itagaki Taisuke. Additionally, while the expedition to Korea was aimed at providing income for unemployed samurai, Saig≈ç did not object to the Inoue-Yoshida plan, which abolished samurai stipends.Kyu Hyun Kim, The Age of Visions and Arguments: Parliamentarianism and the National Public Sphere in Early Meiji Japan, p. 81 Thus Saig≈ç's condemnation of Meiji's provocation against Korea in 1876 suggests that Saig≈ç's intention may have merely been to \\"establish a firm relationship\\" with Korea.Inoue: Saigo Takamori zenshu III: 414416. In any case the other Japanese leaders strongly opposed these plans, partly from budgetary considerations, and partly from realization of the weakness of Japan compared with the Western countries from what they had witnessed during the Iwakura Mission. While orthodox historians view the dispute as a matter of whether or not to invade Korea, the provocation against Korea in 1876 supports the claim that the Iwakura party never disagreed on the validity on an attack. Revisionists see the Seikanron as not a dispute of whether to invade, but instead when and who to do it. The former because those returning from the Iwakura Mission believed that Japan was too weak to attract international attention and needed to focus on internal reforms, the latter because the separation of the government between the caretaker government and the Iwakura groups allowed power-struggle between them. (≈åkubo, for example, had no real position of power at that time, seeing as his position was taken up after his departure). The arguments against invading Korea were outlined in ≈åkubo Toshimichi's \\"7 Points Document\\", dated October 1873, in which he argued that action against Korea was premature because Japan was in the stages of modernizing and an invasion would be far too costly for Japan to sustain. ≈åkubo's views were supported by the anti-war faction which mostly consisted of those returning from the Iwakura Mission. Iwakura had the emperor reverse the decision to send Saig≈ç as an envoy to Korea, thus putting an end to the debate. As it was decided that no action was to be taken against Korea, many of the War Party, including Saig≈ç and Itagaki, resigned from their government positions in protest. Saig≈ç returned to his hometown of Kagoshima, although he was never officially resigned from his role in the palace guard. Some historians (mainly orthodox) suggests that this political split paved the way for the 1874 Saga rebellion and the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion. Itagaki, on the other hand, became involved with the Aikoku K≈çt≈ç, a liberal political party, and rebelled against the Iwakura clique through legal means.

Jeffrey P. \\"Jeff\\" Pyle (born August 30, 1964) is a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and was elected in 2004. He represents the 60th District which includes parts of Armstrong and Indiana counties. Pyle is a 1986 graduate West Virginia University, receiving a bachelor of arts degree in political science. He later earned a bachelor of science in secondary social studies education, graduating cum laude from Indiana University of Pennsylvania in 1991. Pyle went on to teach American history and government at Ford City High School as well as Social Studies at Shannock Valley Jr./Sr. High School. He was recognized for his efforts in and out of the classroom, being named Educator of the Year within his school district in 1999 and Conservation Educator of the Year in 2000. Pyle ran for the 60th Legislative District seat after popular then-incumbent Jeff Coleman surprised constituents and colleagues alike by announcing that he would not seek another term. Coleman then publicly endorsed Pyle as his successor through a series of campaign ads. Prior to his election to the house in 2004, Pyle was the Mayor of Ford City, Pennsylvania. In 2004, he took over 61% of the vote in winning his first term. He was re-elected in 2006 with over 70% and again in 2008 running unopposed. Legislative career In his first term, Pyle introduced legislation to increase the penalties on drug delivery resulting in death. This passed the house 199-0 but was not considered by the Senate. He also worked on legislation to provide property tax relief by raising the state sales tax by 1%. The amendment failed by a few votes.http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/search/s_458121.html Pittsburgh Tribune Review, House vote seals deal on tax relief In 2007, Representative Pyle was appointed as a Deputy Whip and chairs the Task Force on Drugs and Law Enforcement. His work greatly enabled the decision of Allegheny Technologies Inc to build their hot strip mill in Brackenridge which solidified ATI's western Pennsylvania steel making and those jobs for the next century to come. He also serves on the following committees: Environmental Resources and Energy (chair of the subcommittee on Mining), Labor Relations, Liquor Control and as the Republican Secretary of Transportation (chair of the subcommittee on Aviation). In addition, he serves on the House Republican Policy Committee and is a member of the Firefighters and Sportsmens Caucuses Executive Board and chairs the Coal and Diabetes Caucuses. For the 2009-10 legislative session, Pyle has been appointed to serve on the House Environmental Resources and Energy, Game and Fisheries, Transportation and Liquor Control Committees. In 2014 there was a chemical spill of MHCM that polluted the drinking water of 300,000 people around Charleston, West Virginia. The MCHM remaining in the damaged tanks was moved from West Virginia to Rosebud Mining's Dutch Run coal preparation plant near Elderton, Pennsylvania, within Pyle's district, in February, 2014. Reacting to news that Washington lawmakers want more oversight of MCMH, Representative Pyle said training of emergency responders makes sense, but requiring federal oversight of something that's been used for fifty years is \\"capricious\\". Personal Pyle is a survivor of kidney cancer, which was discovered shortly after his election. He underwent surgery and has made a full recovery. Since then, he has remained very active with the American Cancer Society and its Relays for Life over a five county area. He is an avid outdoorsman and rated A+ by the National Rifle Association. He is also a member of the Firearm Owners Against Crime, the Ford City Lions Club, the Kittanning Elks Club, the Ford City Eagles Club, Pony Farm Trap and Gun Club and the Ford City Sportsmens' Club.

It is native to Mexico and Central America but has a nearly pantropical distribution as an introduced species. Depending on the area they may be either annual or perennial. It has shown great potential in raising the soil fertility in soils depleted in nutrients.Achieng, J. O., Ouma, G., Odhiambo, G., & and Muyekho, F. (2007). Effect of tithonia diversifolia (hemsley) and inorganic fertilizers on maize yield on alfisols and ultisols of western kenya . Biennial Conference, Kenya. p.259 Originating in Mexico; research has shown its potential in benefiting poor African farmers.Jama, B., Palm, C. A., Buresh, R. J., Niang, A., Gachengo, C., Nziguheba, G., et al. (2000). Tithonia diversifolia as a green manure for soil fertility improvement in western kenya: A review. Agroforestry Systems, 49. p.202 This plant is a weed that grows quickly and has become an option as an affordable alternative to expensive synthetic fertilizers.Jama et al. 2000, p.202 It has shown to increase plant yields and the soil nutrients of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Description Tithonia diversifolia is in height with upright and sometimes ligneous stalks in the form of woody shrubs. The large, showy flowers are yellow to orange colored and 5‚Äì15 cm wide and 10‚Äì30 cm long. Leaves are sub-ovate, serrate, acute, 10 to 40 cm long, simply or mostly 3-7 lobed, somewhat glandular, and slightly grayish beneath. The seeds are achenes, 4-angled, and 5mm long. The seeds are spread by wind.Lalith Gunasekera, Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka, Colombo 2009, p.109. The leaves of the plant alternate in sides they grow on, which is where the plant gets the name diversifolia. This is accompanied by flowers which are yellow in colour and range from 6‚Äì13 cm in length.Orwa, C., Mutua, A., Kindt, R., Jamnadass, R. & Anthony, S. (2009). Agroforestree database:A tree reference and selection guide version 4.0 . Retrieved November 21, 2013, from http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sites/treedbs/treedatabases.asp It can grow throughout the year and its seeds are spread through way of wind, water, and animals.Jama et al. 2000. p.204  History and geography  This plant was originally domesticated in Mexico and spread to other parts of Central and South America and north into the United States.Orwa 2009, p.2. It was brought over to parts of Africa and Asia as an ornamental plant and has become an invasive weed that is widely spread.Jama et al. 2000, p.202. It is most commonly found in areas with an altitude between 550m and 1950m.Orwa et al. 2009, p.2 It is commonly found scattered among rivers and roadsides.Achieng et al. 2007, p.259 In Asia and Latin America this plant is also referred to as kembang bulan (Indonesian and Javanese), jalacate (Spanish), buatong (Thai) and d√£ qu·ª≥ (Vietnamese).Orwa et al. 2009, p.1.  Symbolism and uses  *In Japan, towards the end of the Meiji Period, they were imported as ornamental plants although seldom cultivated there. Having a characteristic bitter taste, they were used to induce a fever to help fight poisoning, although not used for direct medicinal purposes. There is also the story of the species being introduced to Japan by Nitobe Inazo, hence its Japanese name, the Nitobe chrysanthemum („Éã„Éà„Éô„ÇÆ„ÇØ; Nitobegiku). *It is the official symbol of Da Lat city, Vietnam. *They are sold in herbal medicine markets in Taiwan. *It is the provincial flower of Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand. *T.diversifolia can be used as a green fertilizer for farmers. It can also be used as chicken feed, fuelwood, soil erosion control, and building materials.Olabode, O. S., Sola, O., Akanbi, W. B., Adesina, G. O., & Babajide, P. A. (2007). Evaluation of tithonia diversifolia (hemsl.) A gray for soil improvement. World Journal of Agricultural Sciences, 3(4), 503-507. For fertilization, it is used as a mulch which can be spread on top of the soil or buried beneath it.Liasu, M. O., & Achakazi, A. (2007). Influence of tithonia diversifolia Leaf mulch and fertilizer application on the growth and yield of potted tomato plants. American-Eurasion Journal of Agriculture and Environmental Science, 2(4), p.336 The advantages here is that using the plant as a fertilizer has proven to increase crop yields. T. diversifolia has the ability to restore phosphorus in high amounts to the soil.Nziguheba, G., Merckx, R., Palm, C. A., & Mutuo, P. (2002). Combining tithonia diversifolia and fertilizers for maize production in a phosphorus deficient soil in kenya. Agroforestry Systems, 55, 165-174. T. diversifolia as a fertilizer contains 1.76% N, 0.82% P, and 3.92% K. All three properties are lower in cattle manure, and P is higher in poultry and swine manure.Olabode et al. 2007, p.505.  Growing conditions  T.diversifolia can grow in many different environmental conditions. It has a moderate drought tolerance. It is ideally grown in areas with an annual rainfall ranging from 1000‚Äì2000 mm and a temperature of 15-31 degrees Celsius. This plant does not require a large amount of nutrients because it is able to increase the amount of essential nutrients in the soil itself.Olabode et al. 2007, p.504. As a weed it spreads rapidly which allows farmers to obtain large amounts for the use of fertilization.Jama et al. 2000, p.204.  Economics  A study on the use of this green fertilizer on tomato plants shows that this is a useful method to increase crop yields in order to benefit the farmer‚Äôs wealth.Wanjiku, J., & Kimenye, L. N. (2006). Profitability of kale and tomato production under different soil fertility replenishment technologies in western Kenya. Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, 29(3), p.138. However, this is not without a serious look at the labour requirements. A different study found that, with maize, the overall labour demand versus the financial prospects is not worthwhile, especially in areas of unpredictable rainfalls. This same study also found that growing T. diversifolia on farmer land is not as beneficial from an economic standpoint. Instead, it is better to harvest from an off site location and transport to the fields.Nziguheba et al. 2002, p.171 From this study, fields that received only a P fertilizer yielded an income to the farmer of $50USD/ha. When only T. diversifolia was applied, this income rose to $494USD/ha. The latter results are high, as another study showed an increase of only to $116USD/ha.Wanjiku et al. 2006, p.144  Time issues  Harvesting and distributing this fertilizer over the land by hand is very labour-intensive.Achieng et al. 2007, p.265. The best yields come when T. diversifolia is grown off the land as to not take up growing space. For this reason, when time spent on labour has been factored, this approach may not be beneficial to a farmer.Jama et al. 2000, p.216.  Constraints to wider adoption  While T. diversifolia has moderate drought tolerance, the amount of rainfall that the African subtropics receives may not be enough to support the growing of this biomass.Thor Smestad, B., Tiessen, H., & Buresh, R. J. (2002). Short fallows of tithonia diversifolia and crotalaria grahamiana for soil fertility improvement in western kenya. Agroforestry Systems, 55, 181-194. T. diversifolia currently grows in humid and semi humid areas in Africa.Jama et al. 2000, p. 202. However, no evidence was found to suggest that it had been attempted in desert conditions. Practical information Tithonia diversifolia can be used as organic fertilizer biomass. The biomass refers to materials that are derived from the plant, such as its foliage, being worked into the soil as a dry fertilizer.Liasu et al. 2007, p.336. Since its use as fertilizer requires high labour, it is recommended for use with high value crops such as tomato, kale, carrot, and maize.Wanjiku et al. 2006, p.137 For this use, the plant is first grown in hedges around the edges of harvest land.Jama et al. 2000, p. 202 It is important though to keep the maximum amount of growing area a farmer has. The green stems (not the woody stems), leaves, and flowers can be removed from the plant at a farmer selected time, though it is recommended that cutting every 5 months will give a plentiful amount of nutrients in the biomass.Jama et al. 2000, p.205 The biomass can also be used as a mulch and can be left on top of the soil to decompose into the ground.Liasu et al. 2007, p.336 It has been found that the biomass from T. diversifolia breaks down rapidly and releases nutrients quickly.Jama et al. 2000, p. 208. When applying the mulch or biomass to the soil, it should be applied at the minimum amount of one ton to every hectare of land. However, the best yield is given when 5 tons/hectare is applied.Orwa et al. 2009, p.3. The downside here is that a lot of foliage is needed to cover a small area of land because it has a high water content.Jama et al. 2000, p.215. Mixing this biomass with a synthetic fertilizer will bring higher yields. A study found that when applying tithonia with triple superphosphate (TSP) that the yields increased by 220% compared to a control test containing only an inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (Urea).Opala, P. A., Othineno, C. O., Okalebo, J. R., & Kisinyo, P. O. (2009). Effects of combining organic materials with inorganic phosphorus sources on maize yield and financial benefits in western kenya. Expl Agriculture, 46(1), p.27. When using T. diversifolia it should be supplemented with a Mg fertilizer as this nutrient is lacking in quantity when compared to other green fertilizers.Olabode et al. 2007, p.506.  Research  Tithonia diversifolia is being researched to see whether its bioactive constituents have any potential for pharmaceutical development.

This lark breeds in the highlands of eastern Africa southwards from Ethiopia and northern Somalia. In the south, its range stretches across the continent to Angola and south to the Cape in South Africa. Taxonomy and systematics The red-capped lark was originally placed in the genus Alauda. Alternate names for the red-capped lark include rufous short-toed lark and short-toed lark, although the former may also describe the Somali short-toed lark and the latter is also used as an alternate name for three other species in the genus Calandrella. Formerly, some authorities considered both the Mongolian short- toed lark (as C. c. dukhunensis) and Erlanger's lark (as C. c. erlangeri or C. c. ruficeps) to be subspecies of the red-capped lark . Additionally, some authorities considered the red-capped lark itself to be either conspecific with or as a subspecies of the greater short-toed lark. = Subspecies = Four subspecies are recognized: * C. c. saturatior - Reichenow, 1904: Found from Uganda and western Kenya south to Angola, north-eastern Namibia, northern Botswana and Zambia * C. c. williamsi - Clancey, 1952: Found in central Kenya * C. c. spleniata - (Strickland, 1853): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Alauda. Found from west-central Angola to west-central Namibia * C. c. cinerea - (Gmelin, 1789): Found in southern and central Namibia, southern Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa Description The red- capped lark is a 14- to 15-cm-long bird, with a typically upright stance. The colour of the streaked grey to brown upperparts is variable, with subspecies differing in hue and brightness, but this species is easily identified by its rufous cap, white underparts, and red shoulders. The short head crest is normally not noticeable except when it is raised during courtship displays. The male has redder plumage and a longer crest than the female. Juveniles lack the red cap and shoulders of the adults, have dark spotting on the breast, and white spots on the dark brown upperparts. The call of the red-capped lark is a tshwerp like a sparrow, and the song, given in the display flight, is a jumble of melodious phrases treee, treee, tip-tip, tippy, tippy tippy. It also imitates other birds. Distribution and habitat This is a species of short grassland including fallow agricultural areas. In eastern Africa, it is found in the highlands, normally above 1000 m, but it occurs down to sea level in suitable habitat in the cooler south of its extensive range. Behaviour and ecology The red-capped lark breeds all year round, but mainly from September to December. The nest is a deep, open cup which is set into the ground and usually situated close to a grass tuft, stone or mound. The nest is lined with fine grass and rootlets. The red-capped lark forages on bare ground or in very short grass, moving with short runs to feed on seeds and insects. It is sometimes found in flocks which can number hundreds of birds.

Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the constitutionality of the Major Crimes Act of 1885.. This Congressional act gave the federal courts jurisdiction in certain cases of Indian-on-Indian crimes, even if the crimes were committed on an Indian reservation. Kagama, a Yurok Native American (Indian) accused of murder, was selected as a test case by the Department of Justice to test the constitutionality of the Act. The importance of the ruling in this case was that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains good law, despite that criticism. Background=Crow Dog and the Major Crimes Act of 1885= Crow Dog In 1881, a Brul√© Lakota Sioux named Crow Dog killed his government-installed chief., 36 (2006). Crow Dog was detained and tried for murder.Joseph D. Matal, A Revisionist History of Indian Country, 14 283, 303 (1997). However, he contended that the United States held no jurisdiction on the reservation. The Supreme Court agreed, confirming Crow Dog's assertion that they lacked jurisdiction because the crime occurred in Indian country between two Indians. In the opinion issued by Justice Stanley Matthews for the Supreme Court in Ex parte Crow Dog in 1883,Ex parte Crow Dog, ; , at 39‚Äì42; Matal, at 303. the Court implied that if Congress intended to exert legislative authority over these tribes they must pass an explicit law granting jurisdiction to the federal courts over Indian-on-Indian crime in Indian country, and then the Court would confirm its constitutionality.Sidney L. Harring, The Story of United States v. Kagama, in 150 (Carole Goldberg, Kevin K. Washburn, & Phillip P. Frickey, eds., 2011); , at 39‚Äì42. In response, Congress debated the need and importance of teaching Indians regard for the rule of law. Further, it was argued that if an Indian committed a crime he could be tried under the laws of the United States., at 44‚Äì45. Congress ultimately passed an addendum to the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1885, more commonly known as the Major Crimes Act,Major Crimes Act of 1885, Mar. 3, 1885, (codified as amended at et seq.). claiming exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government to prosecute Indians for seven major crimes anywhere in the nation, if the land is in Indian country, including Indian reservations.Matal, at 303. The seven original crimes included in the 1885 act (the list is now 15 crimes) were murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, and larceny.Harring, at 150. =Hoopa Valley Reservation= Trinity River near reservation The Hoopa Valley Reservation was created by executive order in 1864.1 815 (Charles J. Kappler, ed. 1904); Harring, at 152. At the time the reservation was formed, three unique bands of Indian tribes lived on different parts of the Klamath River, each with its own language. The Yurok lived on the Lower Klamath, the Karuk occupied the Upper Klamath and the Hupa lived at the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers in Humboldt County, California. The reservation was supposed to be a home for other tribes within the region.Harring, at 152. The tribes living along the river had long-established rules for property rights and ownership, including how property was to be passed down from one generation to the next. In some cases, families owned lands that were located a substantial distance from their \\"home\\" village. In charge of the reservation was the Indian agent, Major Charles Porter, who by commanding the local military garrison (Fort Gaston) on the reservation was charged with the de facto responsibility for the people on the reservation.Harring, at 155. Without legal authority and against government policy, Porter allotted small parcels of land to the local Indian people, thus upsetting an age-old property rights system among families in the Klamath River Valley.Harring, at 157. On several occasions, Agent Porter had been called out to Kagama and Iyouse's homes to mediate their property dispute. Shortly before the murder, Kagama requested title to the land upon which he built his home.Harring, at 157. =The crime and the path to the Supreme Court= On June 24, 1885, three months after the Major Crimes Act was passed, Kagama and his son Mahawaha went to Iyouse's house, where an argument ensued that resulted in the death by stabbing of Iyouse., at 45. Mahawaha reportedly held Iyouse's wife while Kagama stabbed Iyouse.Harring, at 157. Agent Porter moved quickly to detain both Kagama and Mahawaha on murder charges. He informed both federal and state authorities. The local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing a policy of not prosecuting crimes between Indians.Harring, at 157. The U.S. Attorney for Northern California forcefully prosecuted the case.Harring, at 157. On October 18, 1885, both Kagama and Mahawaha were taken to San Francisco for trial, after having been indicted for murder.Harring, at 157. The indictment charged that the crime occurred on the reservation, even though it was later determined at the trial to have occurred outside the reservation boundaries to the north.Harring, at 152. Because the crime supposedly occurred on the Hoopa Valley Reservation, the U.S. Attorney and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) fully supported the jurisdictional shift to the federal government and were immediately prepared to prosecute the case in federal courts. Challenges to the subject matter jurisdiction were heard before the circuit court in early October 1885. Circuit Judge Lorenzo Sawyer and District Court Judge George Sabin heard the challenge but disagreed on the law. The case received a \\"certificate of division\\" resulting in the case being forwarded to the Supreme Court later in October.Harring, at 172. Since this case challenged the authority of the federal courts to try Indian- on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.Harring, at 172. Supreme Court=Arguments= Kagama was represented by 27-year-old Joseph D. Redding. The United States was represented by George A. Jenks, who was an Assistant United States Secretary of the Interior. Arguments were heard before the Supreme Court on May 2, 1886, only five months after the circuit court delivered a split opinion on the matter of jurisdiction.Harring, at 172. Jenks urged the court to look to its earlier ruling in Crow Dog, where the Court commented in dicta that Congress possessed the authority to regulate all commerce with Indian tribes, because of the Indian Commerce Clause Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 3. of the Constitution. In his listing of precedents, he cited numerous laws passed by Congress regulating Indian commerce;, at 70‚Äì71. he did not cite any other case law that supported Congress' authority over internal Indian matters, because there was none.Harring, at 172-72. Further, Jenks incorporated aspects of the political debate in Congress when the act was passed citing that the U.S. should be able to enforce its laws within its borders, regardless of treaty rights. The prosecution argued that Congress had the absolute authority to regulate Indians and their affairs.Harring, at 176. Joseph Redding defended his clients vigorously. His argument was three-fold. First he argued that in one hundred years of Indian policy, Congress had never prosecuted Indian-on-Indian crime.Harring, at 177. Further, the indictment as stated contained no element of commerce and was therefore outside the purview of Congress to legislate such a law., at 69; Harring, at 178. Finally, he argued that such a profound shift in Indian policy should not be enacted in a law whose heading and body were wholly inconsistent with the intent of the Major Crimes Act. In effect, he argued that such a law governing a people should be debated in full sight of the American public and on its own merits.Harring, at 178. Redding argued that Congress could not assert power over sovereign people who, when making treaties to cede land, reserved certain rights to themselves., at 69. He did not raise the issue that the tribes already did have a system of law that dealt with crimes against another person.Harring, at 178-79. =Opinion of the Court= Justice Miller, author of the opinion In a unanimous decision issued at the end of May 1886, and authored by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller, the Supreme Court ruled that the Major Crimes Act was constitutional, and, therefore, the case was within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Miller dismissed the argument that the Act was proper under the Indian Commerce Clause, noting that the case did not present a commerce issue., 100 (2006). He held instead that it was necessary since Indians were wards of the United States.Matal, at 303-04. Justice Miller was known for writing opinions that supported federal power over state's rights. This ruling meant that the federal circuit court's indictment would stand and the case would proceed to trial back in Northern California.United States v. Kagama, . The opinion drew heavily on the language of the Solicitor General's brief, which by today's standards would be considered by many as racially charged. The language in Miller's opinion is infamous for its description of Indian tribes as weak, degraded and dependent on the federal government for support. He adopts language from Cherokee Nation v.

Brown also said that Kagama was trustworthy and industrious, while the victim was a \\"treacherous\\" blackmailer who had already killed several men.Pactah Billy Freed. The sheriff believed that Kagama did not have any option but to kill the victim.Pactah Billy Freed. =Consequences and criticism of the decision= Kagama was the case that articulated Congress' plenary power over the Native American tribes in the late 19th century., at 100; Michael A. Powell, Crow Dog and the Issue of Tribal Jurisdiction, in 288-90 (Gordon Morris Bakken ed. 2000). It reaffirmed Congress' power to pass legislation, including the Dawes Act, that would take away many of the liberties that Native Americans had been able to hold on to up until that point.David E. Wilkins, Reconsidering the Tribal-State Compact Process 22 474‚Äì488 (1994). 19th and early 20th century U.S. lawmakers viewed the American Indians as inferior people who would benefit from being assimilated into the Euro-American culture., 100 (1992). The laws that followed the Kagama ruling were attempts to destroy the Native American cultural differences and force these tribes to share the Euro-American culture viewed by these lawmakers to be the superior culture., at 100-02. The decision has been widely criticized by legal scholars. David E. Wilkins noted that if the Indian Commerce Clause or Taxation Clause Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 1. did not contain the authority, and the tribes had not granted it by treaty or consent, then the Major Crimes Act would be unconstitutional and the Court should have declared it void., at 74. Phillip P. Frickey describes the Kagama decision as \\"a whirlwind of circular reasoning\\",Philip P. Frickey, Domesticating Federal Indian Law, 81 31, 34‚Äì35 (1996). with the Court justifying congressional power due to the tribe's weakness, which it also noted was due to the tribes dealing with the U.S. government. Frickey felt the decision was an embarrassment to constitutional theory, to logic, and to humanity. Robert N. Clinton stated that \\"[t]his remarkable decision obviously invoked rhetoric of colonial expansion, rather than the rhetoric of American constitutional discourse.\\"Robert N. Clinton, Tribal Courts and the Federal Union 26 841 (1990). Daniel L. Rotenberg said that Kagama was \\"one more item on the long litany of injustices to the American Indian.\\"Daniel L. Rotenberg, American Indian Tribal Death-A Centennial Remembrance, 41 409, 423 (1986) . In addition to the law professors, various other authors in law reviews have also been critical of the decision. Warren Stapleton, in the Arizona State University law journal, has stated that the decision was incorrect and that the Major Crimes Act is in fact unconstitutional.Warren Stapleton, Indian Country, Federal Justice: Is the Exercise of Federal Jurisdiction Under the Major Crimes Act Constitutional? 29 337 (1997) . In a Comment, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review noted that \\"the Court promulgated what can be called the 'it-must-be-somewhere' doctrine ...\\"Comment: Federal Plenary Power in Indian Affairs After Weeks and Sioux Nation, 131 235, 247 (1982) . Kagama remains good law, being cited in support of the plenary power doctrine as recently as 2004 in United States v. LaraUnited States v. Lara, . by the Supreme Court, and cited in 2015 by the 6th Circuit.NLRB v. Little River Band of Ottawa Indians Tribal Gov't, (slip op. at 6th Cir. available here). Although one legal scholar, Matthew L.M. Fletcher, states that the apex of the doctrine was reached in 1955, in Tee-Hit-Ton Indians v. United States,Tee-Hit- Ton Indians v. United States, . he also acknowledges that the doctrine is still current law.Matthew L.M. Fletcher, A Short History of Indian Law in the Supreme Court, 40- 3, 4 (2015). In 2010, Pawnee lawyer Walter Echo-Hawk wrote in his book, In the Courts of the Conqueror, that Kagama has been used: > [T]o justify excessive government intrusion into the internal affairs of > Indian tribes and to exercise unwarranted control over the lives and > property of American Indians in a slide towards despotism ... [T]he creation > of frightening, state-run, Orwellian societies on Indian reservations was > perfectly legal in the courts of the conqueror, because it was done in the > name of guardianship., 199 (2010).

The song is a ballad, with Bandeira lamenting the end of a relationship. From the lyrics, it seems that he inadvertently caused this to happen. He begs his lover not to leave him, but ultimately appears resigned to his fate. The song was performed sixteenth on the night (following Sweden's Charlotte Nilsson with \\"Take Me To Your Heaven\\" and preceding Ireland's The Mullans with \\"When You Need Me\\"). At the close of voting, it had received 12 points (all from France), placing 21st in a field of 23. Due to the rapidly expanding size of the Contest, the decision was taken to restrict participation in the 2000 contest to those countries with the best average results over the previous 5 years, a group which did not include Portugal.

The station is currently owned by Cantico Nuevo Ministry, Inc. broadcasting an Indian and South Asian radio format. History The station's first incarnation on the 1310 AM frequency was as WQTK in the late 1960s. The station offered a Top 40 format and was a daytime-only radio station, authorized to operate from local sunrise to local sunset. The station became WBIO and offered an adult contemporary format. The station began to have financial problems in 1979 and in 1981 it closed. The station was sold and became WXMC (Crossroads of Morris County) in October 1982. The station then offered a traditional big band and adult standards format playing the hits of the 1930s and 1940s wilt some very traditional standards from the 1950s and a handful of non rock songs from the late 1950s and early 1960s. The station still had financial problems and closed again in May 1983. The station was again sold and put back on the air in March 1984. At that point the station offered an adult contemporary music format. After more financial problems, WXMC changed to a standards format called Music of Your Life in January 1985. The station played the hits of the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s, as well as non-rock songs from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The station also played a limited amount of \\"soft rock\\". Under this format, the station prospered and received high ratings. The station was successful until it was sold in 1989. By the end of 1990, financial problems again set in and, in 1991, it even lost its phone service. That spring, the station went into receivership and an effort was made to keep the station afloat. Phone service was restored but financial difficulties continued to plague the station. WXMC was sold again in summer 1992. That fall, WXMC moved into an adult contemporary format. In summer 1993, WXMC began selling airtime for infomercials and fortune tellers. By 1995, the station was brokered full-time. It also began to remain on the air 24 hours a day. In January 1996, the station was sold and changed to a Spanish adult contemporary format, evolving into a tropical format a few years later. In September 2013 the station was sold to World India Radio for $30,000. In October 2018 it was announced that World India Radio is selling WXMC-1310 and translator W232CY (94.3) to Cantico Neuvo Ministry for $781,000.

Phoebus is mostly known for his music through Despina Vandi and Katy Garbi, although he has composed albums for many other artists in Greece and Cyprus. A high percentage of the albums he composes receive certification making him one of the most successful Greek songwriters of the 1990s and 2000s, selling 3,500,000 records.http://www.phoebusmusic.com/web/cv- gr.html In 2009 he founded his own record label, The Spicy Effect, to which he has signed various artists, many of whom he has collaborated with in the past. He has an estimated net worth at 75 million euros. Biography Phoebus was born on January 1, 1971 in Athens, Greece. He first got interested in music during his school years where he was a drummer in a rock band. During that time he experimented with the music fads of the time. Despite getting into Athens Law School, Phoebus did not want to pursue a career in law, and instead focused on his involvement in music and began to compose his first songs. While studying harmony and music at the conservatory and taking private tutorials by Demis Roussos, he started writing his first lyrics. His talent was quickly shown, and he signed his first contract with a record label at age 22. At the start of his second decade in music, Phoebus made amazing record accomplishments. By that time, he had composed over 18 gold LP's and CD singles, 19 platinum, 9 albums that are two times platinum, 2 albums that are 3 times platinum; Evaisthisies and Profities, 2 four times platinum; Gia and To Kati and 1 six times platinum CD single; Ipofero, selling more than 150,000 units.http://www.discogs.com/artist/Despina+Vandi This in turn gave him his name in Greek music history. During his career, Phoebus has shown the ability in mixing popular music trends with different ideas as well as bringing new artists into the spotlight with his music. Apart from writing and composing, Phoebus, almost exclusively, programs, orchestrates and produces his albums. His producing abilities have broken new ground while he has gone on to sign the highest contracts with all of the record labels he has worked with; starting off with Sony Music Greece, moving to Minos EMI and finally signing on to Heaven Music. In the summer of 2001, Phoebus' career passed a significant milestone as he gained international recognition. Along with Despina Vandi, he received the award for the best-selling album of the year in Greece for the CD single Ipofero (I'm suffering), awarded to him by the director of the Virgin Megastores in London, Sir Richard Branson. In the period 2001‚Äì02, Phoebus collaborated with the famous international producer Desmond Child and other international producers as well for the album of Sakis Rouvas Ola Kala, which was released in the European market by Universal Music France. The album was released in Greece by Minos EMI. On March 6, 2002, Phoebus and Despina Vandi, receive another honour. They won the \\"World‚Äôs Best- Selling Greek Artist 2001\\" award (for the sales of the album Gia) in the World Music Awards. The greatest global success composed by Phoebus came with the song \\"Gia\\" by Despina Vandi. It went multi-platinum in the Greek market, and broke into the international music scene. It was included in the playlists of celebrated DJs and clubs worldwide. \\"Gia\\" reaching the No1 spots in the US Billboard Dance Charts and the UK Dance Charts. It was released as a CD single in Europe, the US, Australia, Turkey and Northern Africa while it has been included in more than 120 compilations, worldwide. In the spring of 2004, Phoebus teamed up with Coca-Cola to compose the tune that will accompany all of Coca-Cola's activities in its Olympic Sponsorship agreement. Phoebus composed the song \\"Come Along Now\\" with Despina Vandi singing it, and the tune was heard all around the world in Coca-Cola's ads. In the beginning of 2005, the Greek football team AEK asked Phoebus to compose the team's new anthem. This imposing melody is played and sung by the team's sports fans until today. 2005 and 2006 were again big years for Phoebus. Despina Vandi's album Stin Avli Tou Paradeisou, after a huge local success was also released in Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine and Turkey reaching the 2nd position on the charts. The album was also repackaged for the Greek market entitled \\"Special Edition\\" and contained 4 new songs composed by Phoebus. The album sold over 100,000 copies in Greece only. Both albums were used by TIM telecommunications for their campaign throughout the whole year since they had a sponsorship contract with Despina Vandi. In the summer of 2005 Phoebus and Victoria Halkiti teamed up and release the song \\"Telia\\", which once again was used by Coca-Cola's ads, but only in Greece and their Sound Wave campaign. Only a few months later their next single \\"F...Magic\\" was heard in all the Attica commercials, one of Athens's biggest shopping malls. After big scores during the 2005 and 2006, together with artists such as Despina Vandi, Elli Kokkinou, Thanos Petrelis, Giorgos Mazonakis and Victoria Halkiti, Phoebus composed the Christmas dance single \\"Kalanta\\" along with Despina Vandi. The single was once again used by TIM telecommunications for their 2006 Christmas campaign. After only two weeks from release date Phoebus and Vandi achieved a 2x platinum CD single. This success over the years and particularly with Despina Vandi has put a name out in the Greek music industry that Phoebus is the composer to go to for an automatic hit. This can be seen also with Heaven Music asking him to compose a song on Fame Story finalist Maro Lytra's second album, which shot her to the number 1 spot on the radio charts with the song \\"I Mihani Tou Hronou\\" (The Time Machine). After some delay, October 21, 2009 brought the end of Phoebus's eight-year collaboration with Heaven Music, announcing through his official site. Reasons of this label change, and the fate of the artists he was collaborating with under the label's name including Despina Vandi and Thanos Petrelis were currently unknown at the time. Vandi officially announced she was leaving Heaven Music on November 2, 2009.

The song featured vocals by Katy Garbi.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90VLz7_vZ-g ** In 1997, the single \\"Love Will Make A Difference\\" was released by Sony Music. The song featured Ronny Money. ** In 1999, a different version of the song \\"Margarites\\" (originally performed by Angela Dimitriou) was released by Sony Music. The song was called \\"Makapy\\" and was performed by Santiago. In the same year, a compilation of some songs performed by Angela Dimitriou was released in Arabic countries, due to the huge success of \\"Margarites\\". The album included songs composed by Phoebus and Giorgos Theofanous, another famous composer from Cyprus. ** In the 1990s, Phoebus composed two songs exclusively for the TV show Bravo, presented by Roula Koromila. The first song, \\"Ki eixa pou les\\" was a duet between Koromila and Antonis Remos, whereas the second one, entitled \\"Sas agapame\\", featured Koromila as the lead singer, accompanied by the children choir of Spyros Lamprou. In 2016, Phoebus collaborated with Koromila once again, composing the music for her TV show Bravo Roula. ** In 2001, Phoebus and Heaven Music released the CD single \\"BB Project\\" which was the official soundtrack of the Greek Big Brother TV show of ANT1 Television. Next year, Phoebus composed the song of the Greek Star Academy show, Fame Story. The song's title was \\"You can be a star\\" and was performed by Giorgos Florakis. Phoebus used the nickname \\"Jason Jazzmind\\" in both projects, instead of his original name. ** In 2004, Coca-Cola released the CD single \\"Coca-Cola\\", including the instrumental song \\"Paralos\\", written exclusively by Phoebus for the Athens 2004 Olympic Games campaign. The song is also included in the CD single \\"Come Along Now\\" of Despina Vandi. ** In 2005, Phoebus composed the anthem of the Greek soccer team AEK. The song was called \\"Mia Agapi Exw Stin Kardia\\" and was performed by Giorgos Florakis. Released by Heaven Music. ** Since 2009, Phoebus has been producing some songs available only in Digital Singles and not in complete albums. He has produced such songs for Akis Deiksimos, Antypas, Apostolia Zoi, Aspa Tsina, Barrice, Christina Maragozi, Christos Cholidis, Christos Menidiatis, Despina Vandi, Dionysis Shoinas, Elissavet Spanou, Giannis Apostolidis, Giorgos Giasemis, Giorgos Ksylouris, Ioakeim Fokas, Kostas Martakis, Lefteris Pantazis, Nino, Panos Kallidis, Stella Kalli, Thanos Petrelis, Tus and Vaggelis Kakouriotis. ** In 2019, Phoebus along with Jean-Paul Wall, Drog_A_Tek composed the soundtrack of the movie \\"The Miracle of the Sargasso Sea\\" by Syllas Tzoumerkas. Notes: (*) Phoebus composed only some tracks and not the whole album. (**) In 1994, Phoebus composed the song \\"Pes Mou Ti Sou Kanei\\" for the album \\"Fovamai Mi Fygeis\\" of Aggelos Dionysiou. According to the album's credits, the composer of the song seems to be Mirto Nikolopoulou. In fact, the real composer is Phoebus. (***) The song Opa Opa was composed by Giorgos Alkaios and not by Phoebus. This song was originally performed by a very famous Greek singer, Notis Sfakianakis in 1992. In 1999, a second, more beat version of Opa Opa was performed by the group Antique, which gave a rebirth to the song. The Despina Vandi version is the final one and features English lyrics for the first time. Although Phoebus is not the composer of the song, he was involved in the arrangements and the whole production. Opa Opa became a huge international hit. (****) In 2002, a compilation of older 4 songs & 5 new written by Phoebus was released by Heaven Music. The songs were performed by most pupular Serbian pop singer Jelena Karleusa. 20-Year Anniversary Concert On 24 September 2012, a special 20-year anniversary special concert dedicated to Phoebus was held.

Armenian state figure, diplomat, enlightener, writer and publicist in Iran. Mirza Melkum Khan is well-known as social reformer and enlightener. He is the first Christian who has adopted the title of ¬´MIRZA¬ª in Persia. The most remarkable aspect of his work was his promotion of law, to bring about an orderly society in which royal power was subjected or Conditioned (Mashrut) to checks and regulations. He developed these ideas in a number of works, but most importantly in his newspaper Qanun (Law), which had a wide readership among Iran's modernists. As such, he can be considered one of the fathers of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution.  Biography  Melkum Khan was born to an Armenian Christian family in IranLloyd Ridgeon, Religion and Politics in Modern Iran (I.B.Tauris, 2005), . p. 14. and educated at the Samuel Muradian school in Paris from 1843 to 1851. He later returned to Iran and entered government service. He was elected as instructor at the newly established Polytechnic in Tehran called Dar ul-Funun, in 1852. He went to Paris in the diplomatic service in 1857.Nikki R. Keddie, with a section by Yann Richard, Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution (Yale University Press, New Haven, 2006), . pp. 431-32. Melkum Khan introduced societies similar to the Freemasons in Iran in 1859, and was exiled by Nasser ad-Din Shah for doing so in 1862. He was later pardoned and given a post at the embassy in Constantinople. There, two years later, he married the daughter of Arakel, a prominent Armenian, with the ceremony taking place in an Armenian church.Algar, Hamid. Mƒ´rzƒÅ Malkum KhƒÅn: A Study in the History of Iranian Modernism page 10 University of California Press, 1973. He returned to Tehran in 1872 as assistant to Grand Vizier Mirza Hosein Khan Moshir od-Dowleh, and became the chief of the Persian legation in London (and later ambassador) in 1872. He remained in the position until 1888, and lost his position in 1889 as the result of a scandal over selling a cancelled concession for a lottery. Nasereddin Shah explains in his third trip's memoir, how he went to Mirza Melkum Khan's house an evening, met his wife and his three daughters two of them as old as 19-20 and the third one who was 6 at the time (1889). From London, Melkum Khan attacked both the shah and Iranian government, and edited the news-sheet Qanun, which was banned in Iran but read by the shah and his ministers. Melkum Khan eventually became recognized as the most important Persian modernizer of the century, and he was later pardoned and reinstated as ambassador to Italy by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah in 1898 with the title of Nezam od-Dowleh. He remained ambassador to Italy until his death in 1908.

It is also the city's university hospital, and the site of the Medical University of Vienna. It is Europe's fifth largest hospital, both by number of employees and bed capacity. History=Old AKH= The origins of Vienna General Hospital go back to Dr. Johann Franckh, who donated properties in 1686, after the end of the second Siege of Vienna, at the corridor Schaffernack for the establishment of a military hospital. However, since money was lacking for the establishment of the buildings, the disabled veterans were quartered, including families, in the Kontumazhof (epidemic hospital), already in existence. In 1693, Emperor Leopold I arranged the establishment of the large hospital. In 1697, the first ward was finished, into which 1,042 persons were quartered. By 1724, 1,740 persons lived there. Extension of the complex was made possible by the will of Ferdinand Baron von Thavonat, who left his estate to disabled soldiers in 1726. The marriage or widow yard, now Thavonathof, was to be finished. Also, the side yards formed by Zwischentrakte, the patient yard (4.), Restaurant economics (5.) and craftsman center (7.) were established. During 1752 to 1774, further development occurred for the student yard (3.) and the house supervisor yard (6.). The inhabitants had to wear their own uniforms and received individual copper coins, which could be redeemed with the bakers in the complex, butchers, etc. The dissolution of the neighbouring cemetery came finally in 1834 of the 8th and 9th wards, in addition. On January 28, 1783, Emperor Joseph II visited the poorhouse. He stated the fact that the enormous plant served more as an accommodation for people who gained entry by virtue of their connections. Those who were the neediest, were still in need of care. Professor Dr. Joseph Quarin, who later became director, used a general hospital plan. On August 16, 1784, the opening took place. The hospital was responsible initially only for the attendance of patients; the remaining tasks of the hospitals were separate. Attached to the hospital was a maternity ward, an orphanage, and a lunatic asylum. The Narrenturm was the first special building for the accommodation of mental patients. Particularly in the 19th century, Vienna General Hospital was the center of the Viennese Medical School, as one of the centers of medical research. Thus Ignaz Semmelweis made his observations of hygiene, and Karl Landsteiner discovered at the AKH the groups of blood types. The site of the old AKH is used as the main university campus of the University of Vienna, and includes the university's medical institutes as well as numerous humanities institutes and several catering trade enterprises and smaller enterprises. The synagogue in the old AKH The synagogue  The synagogue in the old AKH Vienna was established in 1903 by architect Max Fleischer as the \\"praying pavilion\\" for patients of Jewish faith. The synagogue was heavily devastated during the Third Reich's Kristallnacht in 1938, and further destroyed when converted after the war, in 1953, into a transformer station.Feurstein, Michaela, J√ºdisches Wien, B√∂hlau Verlag : Wien. 2001. . In 2005, the remains of the building were restored to become the Marpe Lanefesch Memorial.Neugestaltung des j√ºdischen Bethauses am Campus University of Vienna official site The Narrenturm (Fool's Tower) In the old AKH stands the first building worldwide for the accommodation of mental patients, established in 1784 under Emperor Joseph II by Isidore Canevale. Today, it is the seat of the Federal Pathological- Anatomical Museum, Vienna. The building consisted of a five-part fortress-like circular building with slot-like windows for 200 to 250 mental patients. In its strict geometrical form and austerity, the building is considered as a high point of the revolution classicism. Each cell had strong lattice doors and rings for chaining unrestrained patients. Ten years later, the tower was already completely outdated due to innovations in the therapy for mental patients. From its round form is derived the usual colloquial designation in Vienna, Gugelhupf, meaning a round Austrian cake. The notion that the Fool's Tower is a conversion of the idea of the Panopticon of Jeremy Bentham does not apply, since the cells are not controllable from a central observation post. Already at the oldest model, the Fool's Tower has at the roofridge a lightning rod or a Blitzf√§nger. Two of its mounting plates in the inner court still exist. The apparatus, devised by the Czech priest and inventor Prokop Divi≈° and installed in 1754, was probably not intended as lightning protection. Josef II knew well the attempts of Divi≈°, which specifically concerned an assumed health benefit from currents. Whether the lightning conductors were used for the treatment of the patients has not been clarified. =New AKH= With time, the Joseph-era buildings of the general hospital became unwieldy, so in 1957, it was decided to establish a new large central hospital. The building of the new AKH was begun in the summer of 1964. At the beginning, the personnel hostels and the university clinics for child medicine were moved. In 1974, the building of the main house began. This consists of an outpatient clinic and OI area (approx. 50 OI halls) and two large, 22-floor high bed towers, which accommodate 2,200 beds. The AKH is connected with its own underground (metro) station (U6 Michelbeuern/AKH) to the public transportation network. The Zentralbau with the bed towers was officially opened in 1994, but already partly in use from 1991. The total construction costs are equivalent, in 2004 values, to approximately 4.5 billion euro, projected as 1 billion Schilling (72.67 million euro originally). The construction costs are carried together by the city of Vienna and the Austrian federation. The cost explosion and an associated bribery affair with the building of the new AKH led to the AKH scandal, the largest Austrian building scandal. Moreover, the Austrian magazine ECO reported that only 60% of the AKH was used, and was thus planned much too large. The unused (however completely equipped) part stands completely empty. At present, about 9,000 people are employed at the AKH. Of these, approximately 1,600 physicians and 4,500 allied health and nursing workers attend to patients. Annually, nearly 95,000 people are treated as inpatients, and another half-million attend the hospital's 384 outpatient clinics. Over 11,000 students are registered at the Medical University of Vienna.

The line had three branches at Gardermoen, one of which led to Trandum. Plans for a branch existed from the early 20th century, but the line was not built until the German occupation of Norway in 1940, when the Luftwaffe upgraded Gardermoen. The line opened on 13 June 1941. After the end of the Second World War in 1945 the line was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The line saw limited passenger and cargo traffic, mostly the haulage of aviation fuel. From the 1970s the line fell out of general use, although it was kept in case of war. The line was finally abandoned and the tracks partly removed in the early 2000s. thumb Route The railway line was long and ran from Hauerseter Station on the Trunk Line to Gardermoen Air Station. The line was always owned as a military railway, at first by the Luftwaffe and later by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. It was trafficked by the Norwegian State Railways, but unlike the Trunk Line it was not electrified. The lines started south of Hauerseter Station and crossed Trondheimsveien and then crossed the Sand‚ÄìLi road near Vilberg. It then crossed Blikkvegen and ran downhill to it reached a branch named Lillestr√∏m. The northern branch ran to Trandum, then central branch to Oplandsleiren and the southern crossed Nyvegen before running into the air station. The only facility which resembled a station was a combined loading deck and warehouse at the air station's Hangar C. History Plans for a railway to Gardermoen had first arisen after the turn of the 20th century. These had originally called for a line to run from Jessheim Station on the Trunk Line, but the plans had been abandoned in part because there was no bridge over Kv√¶ndalen. Construction of the line was instead carried from Hauerseter. During the German occupation of Norway during the Second World War, the Luftwaffe commenced major upgrades to Gardermoen Air Station, and saw the strategic value of a railway line to the installation. The line was taken into use on 13 June 1941. The Hauerseter‚ÄìGardermoen Line was built by the German Luftwaffe who had taken over the military facilities at Gardermoen Air Station. During World War II the line was exclusively used for military transport. At first it was used to freight aviation fuel and general cargo, and later it also served military personnel. The railway also allowed the Luftwaffe to have their ammunition depot for Gardermoen located at Hauerseter. Transshipment and other operations resulted in twenty-five people working at Hauerseter Station during the war, compared to seven in 1957. After the war ended in 1945, the line was taken over by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The large number of conscripts made the air force establish passenger traffic on the line in 1947, using Class 87 diesel multiple units. The service was quickly terminated, probably the same year. There were also some attempts to fly civilian air passengers, but these were also soon abandoned, largely because of the poor condition of the track. After this, the line was used only for freight transport, mostly military supplies, fuel and air cargo. It was also used during military practices. A spur line was built to Rustad Sawmill in 1974, introducing civilian traffic. At the end of the 1970s, the military abandoned regular traffic on the line. The southern track was pulled up by enthusiasts from the Urskog‚ÄìH√∏land Line, which used the track for their heritage railway. The middle track was lifted to make room for a firing range. However, the military has retained maintenance of the line so that it at any time is in operational condition, as it had high strategic importance should war break out. During the construction of the European Route E6, it was decided that a new bridge be built over the line, financed by the military budget. The last remaining goods traffic on the line ended in 2000 and the line was completely shut down in 2004. The train tracks for the rail line has afterwards been removed in several places and the railway bridge crossing the E6 was demolished during the construction of a new 4 lane highway in 2008.

Responsibilities  In a typical sales cycle, the stages are: # Contact # Lead / Suspect # Prospect / Opportunity. The task of a presales person starts from the initial contact phase and often ends once the customer has been acquired i.e. sale is made. In some cases, pre-sales also will provide some initial or post-sale transitional support. The responsibilities differ from organization to organization but in general, include: # Solution Preparation/Management Proposal based on Customers Requirements # Product demonstrations # Proof of Concept Creation # Creation of Marketing Documents # ... and any other activity required to generate business The Software Industry and IT Services Industry provides a vital and significant role for presales professionals. The role of presales falls right in the middle marrying the customer needs to the (provider) company's services or products. This role is especially crucial in these industries because the products and services are often heavily customizable and also because the requirements of different customers are often unique. The presales professional thus understands what the customer needs, develops an initial view of the solution the customer needs, then tailors the product or service of his company to meet what the customer needs, explains (or helps sell) this solution to the customer, helps close the deal or sale and often stays on to ensure that the delivery team or product specialists that follow him provide the intended solution. Areas of a specialty of Presales include: # Discovery ‚Äì a means to uncover details of business problems that the prospect has. The presales person will understand and closely analyze the prospect's requirements. # Preparation ‚Äì tailoring a prospect specific presentation or software presentation that precisely meets the needs of the prospect. # Demonstration ‚Äì A demonstration of the vendor product that specifically addresses the prospects of business problems. It will be done in a manner that highlights an easy method to solve those problems using the tools available within the vendor's suite of products. # Request for Proposal (RFP) ‚Äì presales have a detailed knowledge of the product suite, in addition to its application to business problems. As such, presales are frequently involved in technical details in RFP preparation. # Marketing assistance ‚Äì Typically the marketing department and presales department align closely. Given presales is directly in touch with the market, they can share market feedback with the marketing team. Presales will often create technical detail for use in marketing collateral. # Product management assistance ‚Äì Presales are able to provide unparalleled market feedback to product managers that can be used to influence or provide feedback on product roadmap items. # Proposal assistance ‚Äì Given presales were involved in the sale since the discovery of the prospect business problems, presales will often complete the business analysis and technical component of a sales proposal with case studies and facts.  Other uses of the term  In Canada and the United States real estate properties that are sold before construction is completed are referred to as Presales. These properties are known as off-plan properties in the UK, Hong Kong, and Australia. Sometimes, companies which release a product to a small, targeted group of potential buyers, prior to broader marketing and availability, refer to this limited early marketing period as \\"presales\\".

Early life Lilias Trotter was born in Marylebone, London, to Isabella and Alexander Trotter, a wealthy stockbroker for Coutts Bank. Both parents were well-read, intellectually curious, and inclined toward humanitarianism. Isabella Strange, a Low Church Anglican and the daughter of colonial administrator Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange, married Alexander after the death of his first wife, who had borne him six children. Lilias was the first of three children born to this second marriage.Rockness, 37-48. Although Lilias was devastated by the death of her father when she was twelve,Rockness, 19. the family's financial circumstances were only comparatively diminished by his loss. The next year, the family moved to 40 Montagu Square, where a next-door neighbor was writer Anthony Trollope.Rockness, 51. Trollope said that although it was \\"not a gorgeous neighborhood,\\" it was one that suited his \\"declining years and modest resources.\\" Career In her early twenties, Trotter and her mother were greatly influenced by the Higher Life Movement, and Lilias joined the volunteer force that counseled inquirers during the London campaign meetings of American evangelist Dwight L. Moody.Rockness, 54-61, 65-66. Although Trotter was a nearly self-taught artist, her mother believed her talent exceptional, and in 1876, she sent some of Lilias' drawings to art critic and social philosopher John Ruskin while all three were staying in Venice‚Äîthe latter while recovering from the early death of Rose La Touche, a young pupil to whom he had proposed marriage.John Dixon Hunt, The Wider Sea: A Life of John Ruskin (New York: Viking, 1982), 352-54.

One day the mother sent me a pretty little note asking if I would look at the young lady's drawings. On my somewhat sulky permission, a few were sent, in which I saw there was extremely right-minded and careful work, almost totally without knowledge. I sent back a request that the young lady might be allowed to come out sketching with me. She seemed to learn everything the instant she was shown it, and ever so much more than she was taught.\\" \\"The Art of England,\\" Complete Works of John Ruskin (London: George Allen, 1908), 33: 280. Ruskin told Trotter that if she would devote herself to her art \\"she would be the greatest living painter and do things that would be Immortal.\\"Rockness, 83. Although Trotter was drawn to the prospect of a life in art, in May 1879, she decided that she could not give herself \\"to painting and continue still to 'seek first the Kingdom of God and His Righteousness.'\\" She and Ruskin remained friends, and he never entirely relinquished the hope that she might return to art.Rockness, 86. Trotter became active in the Welbeck Street YWCA and served as secretary, \\"a voluntary position usually filled by women like herself from wealthy families.\\"Rockness, 89. She did a considerable amount of teaching and (unusually for respectable young women of the period) fearlessly canvassed the streets alone at night near Victoria Station for prostitutes who might be persuaded to train for an employable skill or to simply spend a night in a hostel.Rockness, 91. Ruskin complained to her, \\"Am I not bad enough? Am I not good enough? Am I not whatever it is enough to be looked after a little when I'm ill, as well as those blessed Magdalenes?\\" In 1884, suffering from physical and emotional exhaustion, she underwent surgery which, though \\"slight in nature ‚Ä¶ left her very ill.\\" Apparently her heart was permanently damaged in the process.Rockness, 92-93. =Algeria= During the next few years, Trotter felt an impulse toward missionary work in non-Christian lands, even telling one of her friends that \\"whenever she prayed, the words 'North Africa' sounded in her soul as though a voice were calling her.\\"Pigott, 15. In May 1887, when a missionary to North Africa asked at a religious meeting if God was calling anyone to North Africa, Trotter rose and said, \\"He is calling me.\\"Padwick, 122. On 14 July, her thirty-fourth birthday, she applied as a candidate to the North African Mission‚Äîwhich then rejected her because she was unable to pass its health examination. However, because she had the resources to be self-supporting, the Mission decided that she might \\"work in harmony\\" with the society without being an official member.Rockness, 98. Nine months later, in March 1888, Trotter and two other financially independent women‚Äîincluding Blanche Haworth, who for more than thirty years played \\"Martha\\" to Trotter's \\"Mary\\"‚ÄîRockness, 265. arrived in Algiers. Trotter recalled, \\"Three of us stood there, looking at our battle-field, none of us fit to pass a doctor for any society, not knowing a soul in the place, or a sentence of Arabic or a clue for beginning work on untouched ground; we only knew we had to come. Truly if God needed weakness, He had it!\\"Trotter, \\"Back-ground and Fore-ground\\" (1913), quoted in Lisa M Sinclair, \\"The Legacy of Isabella Lilias Trotter,\\" International Bulletin of Missionary Research, 26 (January 2002), 32. Trotter's reference is to 2 Corinthians 12:9, \\"my strength is made perfect in weakness.\\" The women moved into the French quarter and diligently studied Arabic through French study materials and eventually through a professional tutor. They also learned how do domestic work, all of them previously having had their needs met by servants.Rockness, 110, 112. Later Trotter said that the early years were like \\"knocking our heads against stone walls,\\" but the women were indefatigable, trying one technique after another in an attempt to make inroads into the Algerian culture and all the while improving their Arabic.Rockness, 115-19. Eventually Trotter was able to gain access to the heavily secluded women by first befriending their children. The outreach to women, she believed, was a \\"great line of cleavage in the rock face of Islam.\\"Sinclair, 33, 35. Converts were banished, beaten, even (Trotter believed) poisoned with \\"mind drugs\\" that were to be administered in food or drink and would produce \\"a paralysis of mind and will.\\" Many converts died, and Trotter \\"came to rejoice in their loss. 'We were glad to let them go ‚Ä¶ One draws a breath of relief when they get safe home [to heaven].'\\"Sinclair, 33. Trotter's health was so seriously impaired that she regularly spent extended periods of convalescence in Great Britain or on the continent. Adding to the difficulties of the English missionaries was French colonial suspicion of their activities. The local government bought a house across the street and for three years lured potential converts away with competing classes. Spies and gendarmes even followed the women into the southern desert and threatened fines and imprisonment for any who went near them or accepted their literature.Rockness, 184-85, 189. An illustration from Trotter's Parables of the Cross. Nevertheless, by 1906, with warming relations between England and France, Trotter experienced less governmental antagonism and more freedom for her missionary work. In 1907 five new workers joined the \\"Algiers Mission Band.\\" By 1920, there were thirty full-time workers and fifteen preaching stations.Sinclair, 33. Trotter became the reluctant, but unchallenged, leader of the group, which in 1907 was named the Algiers Mission Band.The AMB merged in 1964 with North Africa Mission, which changed its name to Arab World Ministries in 1987 and merged with Pioneers-USA in 2010. Pioneers website . Trotter was sensitive to the contemporary difficulty of a woman exerting authority over a man, but as the staff included more men, she shrewdly refined \\"the organizational system to capitalize on their leadership.\\"Rockness, 213-24. Trotter never solicited funds because she said God's wealth was boundless.Trotter, Back-ground, 1-2. Trotter was also a pioneer in attempting to adapt Christian missionary endeavor to the Algerian culture. Referring to evangelistic meetings as a \\"European idea,\\" she proposed evangelizing with \\"a native cafe on a Christian footing,\\" readings of the Bible in a \\"rhythmical recitative\\" accompanied by a drum, a craft house that would teach little girls embroidery, and a Christian retreat for women to \\"take the place of the outings to shrines which are their only chance of fresh air.\\" Trotter designed cards that had biblical passages drawn by an Arab scribe because \\"no one but a native can give the subtle lines & curves of the writing as they should be.\\" The mission society even published a series of cards with a sentence from the Koran followed by verses from the Old Testament.Rockness, 250-51, 258. Trotter was a \\"prodigious writer,\\" filling a journal page nearly every day for forty years and illustrating the world around her with sketches and watercolors. From these efforts came several books of somewhat flowery and mystical prose, including Parables of the Cross and Parables of the Christ-life.Among Trotter's spiritual heroes were Johannes Tauler, Madame Guyon, and George Fox. Rockness, 300. Though she considered orthodox Islam \\"dry as the dune, hard as the gravel,\\" she responded to the \\"sincere hunger for things of the spirit\\" in the Sufi mystics and wrote for them The Way of the Sevenfold Secret as a devotional guide based on the seven \\"I am\\" statements found in the Gospel of John.Rockness, 221, 261, 271-72; Sinclair, 34. The American Helen Lemmel wrote the hymn \\"Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus\\" after reading Trotter's phrase \\"Turn your soul's vision to Jesus, and look and look at Him, and a strange dimness will come over all that is apart from Him.\\" Rockness, 308 Later years and legacy Confined to bed during her last years, Trotter devoted herself to prayer, writing, and sketching while continuing to manage the affairs of the Algiers Mission Band as best she could.Rockness, 306-08. As her body failed, her mind remained clear, even at the end asking prayer for the strength to dictate a letter to Amy Carmichael of India, with whom she had regular correspondence. While attendants sang a hymn, she exclaimed, \\"A chariot and six horses.\\" \\"You are seeing beautiful things,\\" someone asked. \\"Yes,\\" she said, \\"many, many beautiful things.\\" Rockness, 324. In 2015, Oxvision Films released a feature-length documentary, Many Beautiful Things: The Life and Vision of Lilias Trotter. Starring Michelle Dockery as the voice of Lilias Trotter and John Rhys-Davies as the voice of her mentor John Ruskin, Many Beautiful Things premiered in the UK on 11 July 2015 at the Manchester International Festival, and in the United States on 17 October at the Heartland Film Festival.

Smith is a Regents' Professor of physics at Arizona State University. He is an Australian experimental physicist and his research is focussed on using the electron microscope to study the microstructure of different materials. He is a pioneer in high-resolution relectron microscopy technique and is very well known in his field. His interests are focused on thin films, nanostructures, novel materials and magnetism. Research areas His basic research centers around the development of quantitative High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, aided by computer-controlled microscope operation and image simulation, which enables direct determination of atomic structure in defective materials. His research also involves using electron- microscopy-based methods to characterize advanced materials such as semiconductor heterostructures, magnetic thin films and multilayers, and nanostructures. Semiconductor systems of interest include ternary and quaternary Group III nitride alloys for light-emitting diodes and lasers, and II-VI alloys, such as mercury cadmium telluride for detectors of infra-red radiation. Magnetic materials being studied include shape-memory alloys, as well as magnetic tunnel junctions, which are based on ferromagnet-insulator- ferromagnet combinations, that have promising applications for non-volatile, high-storage-density recording media. Off-axis electron holography is a particularly powerful approach since it permits quantitative visualization of nanoscale electric and magnetic fields, and we are using the technique to investigate the magnetization behavior and fringing fields associated with patterned nanostructures.

Green which was produced by Warner Bros. in 1930 and released in 1931.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films 1893-1993:Men of the Sky Men of the Sky stars Irene Delroy and Jack Whiting. Although aircraft were seen in the film, Men of the Sky was more of a spy drama.Wynne 1987, p. 114. Plot In the years before World War I, a love affair takes place between an American pilot named Jack Ames (Jack Whiting) and a French spy named Madeleine Aubert (Irene Delroy). Madeleine leaves her American fianc√© to join her father (John St. Polis), another French spy, at an estate in Germany. Her father instructs her to accept the invitation of a Prussian officer, Eric von Coburg (Bramwell Fletcher), to live at his estate for a month. Jack, believing that Madeleine no longer loves him, joins the Lafayette Escadrille, a squadron of French and American flyers. His first duty is to take a French spy, dressed as a Prussian officer, over the lines. The spy is wounded during the crossing, however, and Jack must take his place. The French spy tells Jack that another French spy will signal him on the piano, playing a happy tune if danger threatens and sad music if the house is safe. Jack puts on the spy's uniform and arrives to find Madeleine at the piano. After Madeleine explains her mission, they continue to exchange messages. The Germans, however, become suspicious of Madeleine and on a night Jack is set to visit, she is entertaining officers of the German intelligence. One of them asks her to play sad music. Realizing that this will place Jack in danger, she signals Jack in Morse code with her left hand. The officers discover the trick, and Jack and Madeleine are captured, accompanying her father to the firing squad. Cast * Irene Delroy as Madeleine Aubert * Bramwell Fletcher as Eric von Coburg * Otto A. Harbach as French Major * Armand Kaliz as Senor Mendoca * Edwin Maxwell as Count * John St. Polis as Madeleine's Father * Jack Whiting as Jack Ames Production The original story and music were written by Otto A. Harbach and Jerome Kern. The film was originally intended to be released, in the United States, early in 1931, but was shelved due to public apathy towards musicals. Despite waiting a number of months, the public proved obstinate and the Warner Bros. reluctantly released the film in June 1931 after making some cuts. The film was released outside the United States (since there was no backlash against musicals outside the United States) as a full musical early in 1931. Men of the Sky was originally intended to be photographed entirely in Technicolor, but this was dropped midway into production when the studio realized due to the public backlash against musicals. The film was originally titled: \\"Call of the East\\" but was retitled before release. the title was changed twice more, first to \\"Stolen Dreams\\" then to Men of the Sky. Much of the music was cut and the film began to be advertised as a spy war drama. As a cost-savings measure, it was decided to release the film in black and white as color had come to be associated with musicals.Barrios 1995, p. 332. The film was to have been the first of three of musicals to be written by Otto A. Harbach and Jerome Kern for Warner Bros. Due to the public apathy for musicals, however, Warner Bros. bought out their contract and the team returned to Broadway.

The tribe belonged to the great Rabi'ah branch of North Arabian tribes, which also included Abdul Qays, Bakr, and Taghlib. Though counted by the classical Arab genealogists as a Christian branch of Bani Bakr, they led an independent existence prior to Islam.Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, Muhammad, Seal of the Prophets, Routledge, 1980, , Google Print, p. 247. Pre-Islamic Era The tribe's members appear to have been mostly sedentary farmers at the dawn of Islam, living in small settlements along the wadis of eastern Nejd (known back then as al-Yamama), particularly the valley of Al-'Irdh, which later came to bear their name (see Wadi Hanifa). Sources such as Yaqut's 13th century encyclopedia credit them with the founding of the towns of Hadjr (the predecessor of today's Riyadh) and Manfuha, and being responsible for the granaries of Al-Kharj. According to legend, the tribe had moved to al-Yamamah from the Hejaz after the region's original inhabitants, the extinct people of Tasm and Jadis were decimated by war. During Muhammad's era During Muhammad's era the Banu Hanifa tribe were involved in military conflict with him. Muhammad ordered the Expedition of Muhammad ibn Maslamah in July, 627AD in Muharram, 6AH.Muhammad Yasin Mahzar Siddiqi, Role of Booty in the economy during the prophets time, Vol. 1, King Abdul Aziz University , p.11. (archive)Note: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available here A platoon of thirty Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad bin Maslamah was despatched on a military mission. It headed for the habitation of Banu Bakr sept. The Muslims attacked that sept and dispersed them in all directions. Plenty of spoils (war booty) were captured and the Muslims returned with the chief of the tribe of Banu Hanifa, called Thumamah bin Uthal Al-Hanifi. Muhammad's Companions tied him to a pole of a Mosque. To a question posed by Muhammad, Thumamah used to say: \\"If you were to kill someone, then you would have to choose one of noble descent, if you were to be gracious, then let it be to a grateful man and if you were to ask for money, you would have to ask for it from a generous man.\\" He repeated that three times on three occasions. The third time, Muhammad ordered that he should be released and later he converted to Islam. Islamic Era Banu Hanifa played an important role in early Islamic history. At around 632, according to the traditional Muslim chroniclers, they sent a delegation pledging allegiance to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Among the members of the delegation was Musaylimah, who, probably from what he then saw, conceived the idea that he might set up a claim to prophethood. The delegation, before their departure, embraced Islam and denounced Christianity without compunction. Muhammad died shortly afterwards, and the Banu Hanifa immediately renounced their new religion, under the leadership of their own self-proclaimed prophet, Musaylima. It is said, however, that Musaylima had declared his prophethood shortly before Muhammad's death, claiming to have been made a partner of Muhammad's in divine revelation. This, along with other apostasy movements in Arabia, triggered the Ridda Wars, in which the Muslims of Medina, under the leadership of the first caliph Abu Bakr, subjugated the rebellious tribes, but not before some heavy losses. The Muslims of Medina were only able to defeat Banu Hanifa on the third attempt, killing Musaylima in the battle of 'Aqraba, some 30 km north of modern Riyadh, and the rest of Banu Hanifa then made peace with the Muslims and rejoined the new Islamic state. Umayyad and Abbasid Eras Due to their role in the Apostasy movement, members of Banu Hanifa were initially banned from participating in the early Muslim conquests by the first Caliph, Abu Bakr. The ban was lifted by Abu Bakr's successor Umar, and members of Bani Hanifa subsequently joined Muslim forces in Iraq, with some settling in garrison towns such as al-Kufa. Tribesmen from Banu Hanifa also supplied the ranks of rebellious movements such as the Kharijites. One member of the tribe by the name of Najdah ibn 'Amir, even founded a short-lived Kharijite state in al-Yamama during the Umayyad era. Thereafter the tribe seems to have resumed its pre-Islamic agricultural way of life, leading the famous Umayyad- era poet Jarir ibn Atiya to mock them in scathing satirical verse for choosing the \\"humble\\" life of the farmer over the \\"glorious\\" life of the Arab nomad, and accusing them of cowardice and incompetence in battle. Others such as the 8th century literary critic al-Jahiz, however, express admiration for their military prowess, surrounded as they were by hostile tribes from every direction. Al-Jahiz, however, also notes with curiosity that the tribe produced almost no poets of any repute. The tribes small pastoralist bedouin section, mentioned only fleetingly by Muslim sources, appears to have joined the rest of the bedouins of Bakr and 'Annizah in northern Arabia and southern Iraq, at some point after Islam according to al-Tabari. Perhaps due to the legacy of the Ridda Wars and Najdah's Kharijites, the Umayyads and Abbasids made sure never to appoint a member of the tribe to governorship in their native province of Yamamah. In the 9th century, the Alid dynasty of Banul Ukhaidhir came to power in al-Yamama, having fled there from their native Mecca. According to Yaqut and others, Ukhaidhirite rule was harsh on Bani Hanifa, leading many of them to leave for Basra in Iraq, and to Upper Egypt, where sources such as al-Yaqubi of the 9th century state that Bani Hanifa formed the majority of the population of the valley of Wadi al-Allaqi, near Aswan, having moved there earlier with their women and children. There they worked in gold mining, and according to Yaqut, the \\"sultan of al-Allaqi\\" was a man of Bani Hanifa. Geographers such as Al-Hamadani of the 10th century and Yaqut of the 13th seem to indicate that Bani Hanifa still resided in its ancestral lands at the time of their writings, though the tribe seems to have held little political power by then, and many of their old settlements had been taken over by other tribes, such as Bani Tamim and Bani 'Amir. Yaqut, however, reports that they still formed the majority in al-Yamama's provincial capital, Hadjr, though he could have been reporting from an earlier source. 13th Century Onwards In the 14th century, however, Ibn Batuta relating his visit to Hadjr, also states that most of its inhabitants are from Banu Hanifa, and even joins their emir, one Tufail ibn Ghanim, on a pilgrimate to Mecca. Little else is heard from Banu Hanifa thereafter, except that a number of clans in the region of Wadi Hanifa are given a Hanafite lineage by Jabr ibn Sayyar, the ruler of nearby Al-Qassab, in his short 17th-century manuscript on the genealogies of the people of Nejd. Since no such manuscript is available for verification nor can such a figure be found recorded in history, the basis or validity of this source is dubious at best.

He served as the first Vicar Apostolic of the Western District of England and Wales, and subsequently Bishop of Segni in Italy. Life He was born Philip Ellis, the son of John Ellis, Rector of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, a descendant of the Ellis family of Kiddall Hall, Yorkshire, and Susannah Welbore. Of six brothers, John, the eldest, became Under-Secretary of State to William III of England; William, a Jacobite Protestant, was Secretary of State of James II of England in exile; Welbore became Protestant bishop of Kildare and afterwards of Bishop of Meath, Ireland; Samuel was Marshal of King's Bench; and Charles an Anglican clergyman. Ellis, while still a Westminster schoolboy, was converted to the Catholic faith from his Anglicanism, and when 18 years old went to St Gregory Priory in Douai, France, where he was received as a monk, taking the religious name of Michael, making his religious profession on 30 November 1670. Receiving ordination shortly after, he returned in 1685 to serve in the English Mission, at which time he became one of the royal chaplains. In 1688 he was appointed vicar Apostolic of the newly created Western District and was consecrated by Ferdinando d'Adda, the papal nuncio (6 May). During the Glorious Revolution of 1688 Ellis was imprisoned, but being soon liberated he retired to the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye in France and afterwards to Rome. In 1696 he was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne; in Rome his knowledge of English affairs made him so useful that his repeated petitions for leave to return to his vicariate were refused. In 1704 Ellis resigned the vicariate, and in 1708 was made the Bishop of Segni by Pope Clement XI, being enthroned on 28 October. His first care was to rebuild the ruined Monastery of Santa Chiara and open it as a diocesan seminary. This he enriched with many gifts and a large legacy. A curious survival of his English title is an inscription at Segni to \\"Ph. M. Mylord Ellis\\". After his death, this became his resting place. Eleven sermons preached in 1685 and 1686 before King James II, Queen Mary of Modena, and Queen Dowager Catherine of Braganza, were published in pamphlet form, some of which have been reprinted (London, 1741; 1772). The Acts of his synod at Segni in 1710 were also published by order of Pope Clement.

Denness' decisions initiated protests by the Indian team. The actions of Denness in handing punishments to six players from one team was unprecedented and the matter is still viewed with controversy in India: * Sachin Tendulkar: suspended ban for one Test Match due to ball-tampering charges. * Virender Sehwag: banned for one Test match due to excessive appealing. * Sourav Ganguly: suspended ban for one Test match and two One Day Internationals due to inability to control the behaviour of his team. * Harbhajan Singh: suspended ban for one Test match due to excessive appealing. * Shiv Sunder Das: suspended ban for one Test match due to excessive appealing. * Deep Dasgupta: suspended ban for one Test match due to excessive appealing. The result of the discussions between the officials was that the third Test in the three-Test series between the teams, at SuperSport Park, Centurion, was deemed \\"unofficial\\" by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Sehwag was made to serve his one-match ban. Denness was heavily criticised for failing to explain his actions at a press conference, thus infuriating the Indian cricket establishment and precipitating an international cricketing, political and administrative crisis. Public outrage, \\"Unofficial\\" Test and Sehwag's ban There was a huge outrage in India where protestors took to the streets and burnt effigies of Denness. The matter was raised in the Indian parliament, the popular press termed Denness a racist, and the ICC was accused of discriminating against the emerging Third World. The public face of the protest was ex-India cricketer and commentator Ravi Shastri, who asked at the aforementioned press conference that \\"If Mike Denness cannot answer questions, why is he here? We know what he looks like.\\" The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) threatened to call off its tour of South Africa unless Denness was replaced as match referee for the third Test. The ICC supported Denness but the South African board sided with the BCCI's position and replaced Denness, who was not even allowed to enter the stadium, with Denis Lindsay. Consequently, the ICC declared the match to be \\"unofficial\\" and instead classified it as a \\"friendly five-day match\\". The series was thus officially limited to the two Tests already completed, with South Africa therefore the 1-0 winners. ICC upheld the ban on Sehwag for the subsequent Test, but overturned the bans on Tendulkar and Ganguly. The subsequent England tour to India was placed in jeopardy when India picked Sehwag in the Test squad. Subsequent to this development, the ICC issued a warning that any Test match with Sehwag in the Indian team would not be considered an official Test until Sehwag served his ban. After negotiations with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the ICC, and in the general interest of cricket, Sehwag was dropped from the team for the first Test against England. After the incident Mike Denness served as match referee in only two more Tests and three more One Day Internationals. These were all in the series between Pakistan and the West Indies in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, during January and February 2002. An ICC Disputes Resolution Committee hearing headed by Michael Beloff QC, the then Chairman of the ICC Code of Conduct Commission, was scheduled to hear the case on 6‚Äì7 June 2002. But the hearing was postponed a week before its scheduled date due to the ill- health and surgery plans of Denness. The Resolution Committee never met to decide on the merits of the cases of Denness and the Indian team as the BCCI decided to forgo the case in view of Denness' heart surgery.

History The company was founded by George Barham in 1864 as the 'Express County Milk Supply Company,' so named as they only used express trains to get their milk to London. The major creamery and milk bottling plant was located just south of South Acton railway station on the North London Line. This gave easy and equal access for milk trains from both the Great Western Railway and the Southern Railway. An Express Dairies Morrison Marsden milk float The company was purchased by Grand Metropolitan in 1969, and sold in November 1991 to Northern Foods. It was demerged from Northern Foods in 1998, and purchased a 51% controlling stake in Claymore Dairies Ltd of Scotland, for ¬£2.2 million. Express Dairies acquired Star Dairies Food Service Ltd. and certain assets of Star Dairies International Ltd for ¬£3.5 million in February 1999. In June 1999, the liquid milk operations of the United Kingdom of Glanbia plc were acquired for ¬£100 million, and the share capital of Blakes Chilled Distribution Ltd. was purchased in August for ¬£3 million. Express Dairies announced a joint venture in Northern Ireland with Golden Vale plc in November 2000, that created Dale Farm Dairies Ltd, although that was sold in October 2001. Express Dairies disposed of its UHT business and Frome creamery in July 2002. Following a period of poor profitability, the business was acquired in March 2003 by Arla Foods, who in turn sold it on to Dairy Crest in July 2006. Dairy Crest sold its deliveries business to Creamline Dairies in July 2013, and its milk processing business to Germany's M√ºller in December 2015.

The chairman's new son in law, American citizen and ex sailor of the US Navy, Patrick Galvani, had been studying retailing before coming to the United Kingdom, particularly supermarkets. Galvani made a pitch to the board, which resulted in Britain's first supermarket opening in Streatham, South London in 1951 under the Premier Supermarket brand. In 1960, in an attempt to expand nationwide, Galvani made a pitch to the board to buy Irwin's 212 stores, but they refused to back him; Jack Cohen of Tesco subsequently bought the chain. In 1964, the chain was sold to Unilever's Mac Fisheries chain for ¬£1million. The cash income allowed Express to develop and launch marketing for long-life milk.

The Pirates were 9‚Äì1 in the regular season, 4‚Äì1 in the Marine League. The Pirates had one of the best defenses in the South Bay and QB Barry Heads led an efficient offense. They began the season 6‚Äì0 with victories over Santee, Palos Verdes, Garfield, Locke, Sylmar and Carson. In the 7th week they lost to Narbonne, 27-24 in triple overtime. The Pirates bounced back to end the season with victories over Banning, Washington and Gardena. They were given the second seed in the playoffs. The first playoff game was a rematch against Sylmar and the Pirates emerged victorious, 34‚Äì3. Venice came next and the Pirates shutout the Gondoliers 31‚Äì0. The semi-final pitted Pedro against fellow City power Taft. The Pirates once again dominated and won 27‚Äì7, thus setting up a rematch against Narbonne, who defeated Crenshaw 25‚Äì24 in the other semifinal. In the final on Saturday, December 13 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Pirates tied Narbonne 21-21, but it was not without controversy. Down 21-14 in the final seconds, the Pirates scored on the game's final play, a 15-yard touchdown pass from Heads to Benny Weischedel in the back of the end zone as time expired. Despite being down a point and a rule preventing overtime, the Pirates' head coach Mike Walsh opted to go for a PAT kick, rather than a two- point conversion for the chance to win it outright. Donald Jarrin made the kick and San Pedro settled for the tie and the 'Co-champions' label with the Gauchos. =2018 season= In Corey Miller's third season as coach, San Pedro captured the football program's sixth CIF-Los Angeles City Section championship with a 22-20 victory over Dorsey High School at El Camino College in the Division 1 final (top division is now known as the Open Division). Joshua Ward ran for two touchdowns in the victory, including a 29-yard touchdown midway through the second quarter where he broke free from seven tackles. Just seconds later, Joshua Johnson intercepted a pass, returning it 27 yards for a touchdown to put the Pirates ahead, 16-14. San Pedro finished 8-6 on the field (but earned a forfeit victory months later to officially finish 9-5 overall), closing the season with five straight victories after losing six of their first nine games on the field.  Volleyball The boys team won the CIF-Los Angeles City Section Invitational Championship in 2006 in four sets over Carson, as well as making the Division 1 semifinals in 2013, losing to Palisades in five sets. The boys program won their first CIF title in 1983 with a five-set victory over University. In 2018, the girls team captured the CIF-LACS Division 1 championship with a four-set victory over El Camino Real Charter at Birmingham Community Charter High School on Saturday, November 3, 2018. The Lady Pirates finished 26-6 under the leadership of coaches Gerald Aquiningoc and Christopher Ceballos, and featured three All- City Division 1 players, all seniors, in Sara Peterson, Hanna Gurrola and Lauren Sutrin. In all, the girls volleyball program has won four CIF titles (2001, 2004, 2005, 2018), with the 2004 and 2005 teams winning back-to-back Division 1 championships. The girls won five straight undefeated Marine League championships from 2005 through 2009, reaching the finals two more times in 2006 and 2009. Softball The San Pedro High School softball program has a rich tradition that began with their first team in 1974. Two years later; the program captured its first CIF-Los Angeles City Section championship in 1976. The 1979 team finished a perfect 31-0 overall in capturing their third CIF- LACS title in four years. As of the 2020 season shortened by the coronavirus outbreak, the Pirates have won 17 CIF titles (1976, 1977, 1979, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 & 2017). The Pirates once played in ten consecutive CIF-LACS championship games (2000‚Äì2009), winning nine titles, including five straight from 2000 through 2004, winning the other four straight from 2006 through 2009. The Pirates' posted a record of 281 wins, 24 losses and one draw during the 2000 decade, winning the Marine League championship all ten years, sharing the league title three times (2001, 2003, 2006). The softball program of San Pedro High School has four alumni that has played in the NCAA Women‚Äôs College World Series, and four more alumni that are enshrined in the San Pedro Sportswalk Of Fame (now known as the Los Angeles Sportswalk Of Fame). San Pedro's most recent softball CIF title came on May 20, 2017 with a 2-1 victory over Banning at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson. Gymnasiums San Pedro High has three gymnasiums, one dating back to when the current location of the campus was constructed in 1936. The small gym, formerly known as the Girls Gymnasium, was constructed in the 1960s when the Math/Science building was constructed. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in June 2007 to celebrate the start of construction on the schools newest building, a gymnasium. =Small Gym= It was constructed when the school expanded in the early 1960s. Located in an area that once had houses, It has a gym floor, basketball hoops, a volleyball net system, a storage room, and two bathrooms. It had multiple purposes. It was used after school for many years for the Short Flag Team to practice. It was also used to administer the California High School Exit Exam. Nonetheless it has now been converted into a Workout Gym, with new work out equipment and is open after school M-Th 3‚Äì6. It is now the designated indoor weight room on campus. Numerous campus teams are left without a place to practice due to the conversion of the gym into a workout room. =Large Gym (\\"Old Gym\\")= The Large Gym was constructed in 1936 when the current school was built. The Large Gym is still in use for multiple uses, including basketball and volleyball practices, student art shows, flags drill and cheer, and youth services permits. This gym also has a boys and girls locker rooms, PE Offices, & restrooms for the physical education department. The old weight room has been converted into a large dance floor for the \\"Pirate Dancers\\". It was converted when the newest gym was being built in 2006-2008. This gym is also the area designated for all the PE classes when it is raining outside. It is also home to the indoor pep rallies. =Main Gymnasium= The recently completed new main gym was opened in a ribbon cutting ceremony on Thursday, December 11, 2008. The first game played in the new gym was Monday, December 15, 2008, a boys basketball Marine League opening game against Washington Preparatory High School. The Pirates rallied to win 68-63, making it the first game won in the new gym and their first victory over the Generals since 1992. The gym has a seating capacity of 2,013; has two locker rooms for male and female students, an elevator for the handicapped, restrooms, a fitness center, two storage rooms, electrical room, ticket booth and an upper and lower lobby, all which is state of the art. The actual gym floor is open for use by the basketball teams and volleyball teams for practices, conditioning classes and games. The new volleyball system, donated by the Boosters and Lady Boosters, allows for three practice nets to be set up at once, though only two can be used at once for tournament games due to close court spacing. Other uses of the gym are restricted in order to preserve the surface of the wood floor and prevent unnecessary wear and tear. The biggest sporting event played in the Main Gym came on October 30, 2018, when the girls volleyball team hosted a CIF-Los Angeles City Section Division 1 semifinal match, defeating Bell in four sets. Senior Court Senior Court is a courtyard behind the administration building dedicated to the Senior Class back in the 1940s. The idea for the court was suggested by 1944-45 student body president Pete F Manghera. The Senior Court area was built to have a designated area for the seniors to hang out at when not in class. Senior Court is about 100 ft by 70 ft long. The courtyard is home to the \\"Senior Benches\\" which are standard school benches painted black and gold. Leadership paints club names, the class motto, and the class year on these benches, etc. It is also home to the Richard Anderson Memorial Bench. Senior Court nonetheless is the second largest hang out area on campus to the flag pole. The flag pole area is east of Senior Court. =Richard Anderson Memorial Bench= Is a marble bench with Richard Anderson's name and class year and years attended engraved. Richard Anderson was the class of S'57 to be. His death came during football practice during his senior year and was an accident. He died from severe head trauma. The San Pedro football player was a very popular student. The bench was placed within several years of his death. The original bench was vandalized and a new one was placed shortly after. The bench was paid for and placed by his former classmates. Mike Walsh Pirate Stadium The Pirate Stadium Sports Complex is located on the far east side of the San Pedro campus. It is south of the baseball field, and east of the softball field. Pirate Stadium is home to the football team, soccer team and the track team. The US $4 million sports complex has an oval eight-lane red clay track a quarter mile long used for the track team and physical education department as well as for public use when the field is not needed for the school. The stadium has a 6,000-fan capacity, 4,000 on the home grandstands and 2,000 for the visitor grandstands. The field has two uprights for the football season and two goals for the soccer season. The first sporting event played at Pirate Stadium was October 13, 2000 against Banning. In the far Northwest corner is a thirty-foot large Pirate statue that was bought from a Long Beach restaurant. Just behind the north upright there is the Victory Arch, dating back to 1936. The field's all-purpose scoreboard is in the southwest corner of the stadium. Every year the Stadium holds the annual \\"Relay For Life\\" campaign that benefits those with cancer. It is a 24-hour walk around the track. For every lap walked a sponsor will donate a certain amount of money to the event. During the event the stadium field is surfaced with tents and a large stage that has many different bands play to keep the participants entertained. In 2013, the Pirate Stadium all-weather track was dedicated in honor of the late San Pedro historian Sam Domancich, who also wrote the book, \\"Hit The Line: 100 Years Of San Pedro High School Football\\" after the 2006 football season. The scoreboard was updated with a 'Sam Domancich Track' sign on the bottom, with a Pirate logo on the left side, and a digital head shot photo of Domancich on the right. On September 28, 2018, Pirate Stadium itself was given its current new name, the Mike Walsh Pirate Stadium, honoring longtime coach Mike Walsh for his 25 years of service as a head coach, and over 30 years of coaching football and baseball at San Pedro High, during halftime of a Marine League football game against visiting Carson. The scoreboard was then revealed with a second update, a 'Mike Walsh Pirate Stadium' sign on the top. =Victory Arch= The Victory Arch was commissioned by Joseph M. Mardesich and dedicated to the school in June of 1938. The two large eagles mounted high on their supporting structures once stood at the main entrance to the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles, on Main and Temple. The arch is engraved with several chiseled inscriptions, most notable is the succinct manifesto for all to aspire to \\"Wisdom, Integrity, Self-Respect.\\" It is traditional for the football team to run though the arch onto the field preceding a game to bolster their potential victory and for graduates to walk through as they accept their diplomas. The Victory Arch is located at the north end of the football field because the team wants their season to end at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the once former home for the CIF-Los Angeles City Section football championships (now played at the recently renovated football stadium at El Camino College in Torrance since the 2016 season), a short drive north of the school.  Fore N' Aft  The newspaper is published in print and online every three to four weeks by the Advanced Journalism class from the associated body of San Pedro High School. Any person attending the school may submit articles, poems, drawings, or photos to the publication. The advisor of the newspaper is Mr. Steven Gebhart.

Students enrolled in the program are required to complete four years of math and science classes and must complete community service hours focusing in marine science.http://www.sanpedrohs.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=78206&type;=d&pREC;_ID=139101 The primary focus is marine science, so students have the opportunity to enroll in specialized science classes including Marine biology, Physical oceanography, and Advanced Marine Science. By working with the Marine Mammal Care Center,Marine Mammal Care Center, San Pedro CA students may also take classes and participate in a Marine Mammal Internship on site. This program offers students opportunities to work hands-on with marine animals. As of June 2009, the Marine Mammal Internship was no longer available to the students. Class Size and Budget Cuts were a factor of its removal.

BOAT RACE competitors fly around the corner at Suminoe. A large clock is used to count down to the start of each race. A night BOAT RACE at Suminoe. The , literally \\"boat racing\\" and referred to as BOAT RACE,„ÄåÁ´∂ËâáÊåØËàà‰ºö„Äç„Åã„Çâ„ÄåBOAT RACEÊåØËàà‰ºö„Äç„Å∏ (in Japanese) is a hydroplane racing event primary held in Japan. It is one of Japan's four , which are sports events where parimutuel betting is legal. Ky≈çtei was introduced in Japan in April 1952, when the first race was held at ≈åmura Ky≈çtei Stadium in ≈åmura City, Nagasaki Prefecture. In April 2010, to promote the sport to a wide variety of people as well as internationally, the Kyotei Promotion Association began referring to the sport as BOAT RACE, and the organization itself was renamed the BOAT RACE Promotion Association. There are 24 ky≈çtei stadiums in Japan, all of which refer to themselves as BOAT RACE courses. Ky≈çtei races A Ky≈çtei race is conducted on man-made lakes with a 600-meter oval boat course. Six boats race three laps around the course (1,800 meters). Races are generally over in about two minutes. Ky≈çtei employs the flying start system of beginning races. Once competitors receive the signal to pit-out of the docks, they will maneuver their boats in an effort to secure a starting position while a large clock situated at the start/finish line begins a one-minute countdown. Starting positions are usually established with 30 seconds before the clock reaches zero, and with about 12 seconds remaining the boats begin to race up towards the start line at full speed. Boats must cross the start line within one second after the clock reaches zero. If a boat crosses the line too early - a , or crosses too late - called a , it is scratched from the race and bets on that boat are refunded. The Japanese term for this exclusion is . In a sense, the flying start system can be compared to the mobile start used in harness racing. Once a race begins, boats fight for the best position entering the first turn marker. Race winners are often decided on the very first turn of the race. The first boat across the line after three laps is the winner, with the first three finishers deciding the payouts for bets. If a boat causes interference with another boat, is involved in an accident or becomes disabled, the boat is . No refunds are given for disqualified boats, unless all boats are disqualified for some reason. Prior to the start of a race, competitors conduct a practice start and run a few laps around the course to practice their straight runs and cornering. These ensure that their boats are functioning properly, and also provide the betting public with useful information. During the practice, a straight run of 150 meters is timed for each boat and announced to the public. Also, competitors are not penalized for false or late starts during the practice run. Competitors are assigned an engine and a boat at random to use for race day. Competitors can tune their own engines between the exhibition run and the race. Up until 2012, they were also permitted to use their own propellers. Similar to other water and land-based motorsport where a minimum dry weight requirement includes the driver, rules require men to weigh in at 50 kg or more, while women must weigh in at 47 kg or more. If any competitor is short of the minimum weight, their boat will be loaded with additional ballast weight to compensate. Competitors Each racer involved in Ky≈çtei is assigned a rank. From the top down, the ranks are A1, A2, B1 and B2. Each competitor's performance over a six month period determines whether they are promoted, demoted, or keep the same rank. Racers in the higher A classes are permitted to compete in more races more often. Each tournament carries one of five designations: SG (Special Grade), G1, G2, G3 and General. SG races are held around eight times a year and are only open to the highest A1 ky≈çtei competitors. The last major tournament of the year, the Grand Prix, determines the annual champion in terms of prize money won. A unique aspect of the sport is the fact that women can compete as equally as men. As the weights of racers make an important difference in hydroplane racing, female racers, often lighter than their male counterparts, have certain advantages. Roughly 10% of Ky≈çtei racers are women. Training of Ky≈çtei competitors is carried out at the Yamato Ky≈çtei School (now the Boat Racer Training School) in Yanagawa City, Fukuoka Prefecture.

The tribe is of North Arabian (Adnanite) stock, and traces its lineage to the large, ancient tribe of Banu 'Amir, also known as 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'a, who came to dominate Nejd in the medieval period. At the turn of the 20th century, the tribe comprised both nomadic (bedouin) and sedentary sections. The original grazing lands of the tribe's bedouins had been the region of Ranyah and Kurmah, on the border between Nejd and 'Asir. The tribe ended up roaming the areas of central Nejd around Riyadh, along with the closely related tribe of the Suhool. Some sections, though, moved further north, where they later established the town of Rumah. Today, they are mostly found in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. The sedentary members of the tribe, on the other hand, have mostly resided in central Arabia for centuries, a possible legacy of Banu 'Amir's heyday. Families that belong to Subay' can be found in practically every town in the region, making up a disproportionate amount of central Arabia's traditional sedentary population. Alsubaie were Prophet Mohammed‚Äôs knights. Also, they were the knights of Saudi 1, Saudi 2, and The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia until now. Furthermore, Alsubaie has never lost a fight.

Life  Violant was born in Zaragoza, the daughter of King James I of Aragon (1213‚Äì1276) and his second wife, Yolande of Hungary (ca.1215-1253).Elena Woodacre, Queenship in the Mediterranean: Negotiating the Role of the Queen in the Medieval and Early Modern Eras, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), 52. Her maternal grandparents were Andrew II of Hungary and Yolanda de Courtenay.Reassessing the Roles of Women as 'Makers' of Medieval Art and Architecture, ed. Theresa Martin, (Brill, 2012), 1089. In January 1249, Violant married King Alfonso X of Castile at Burgos, who before his marriage, had a romantic relationship with Mayor Guill√©n de Guzm√°n who bore to him an illegitimate daughter Beatrice. Due to Violant's young age, she was unable to get pregnant for several years. Alfonso came to believe that his wife was barren and came to even consider the possibility of asking the pope for an annulment of the marriage. Legend has it that the Queen could not get pregnant and the doctor told her to rest. Alicante was recaptured by the Crown of Castile and the King and Queen rested in a farm located in the fields near the city, and there she became pregnant; the King decided to call the place \\"Pla del Bon Repos\\" (\\"Plain of good sleep\\"), a name that has been left to posterity and today is a suburb of Alicante. In 1275, Violant's son and heir to Castile, Ferdinand de la Cerda died heir to the Castilian-Leonese throne and Alfonso at first ignored the rights of Ferdinand's two sons, Alfonso and Fernando, and instead made their second son, Prince Sancho heir; he would later succeed as Sancho IV of Castile. In response, the widow of Ferdinand, Blanche of France, enlisted the help of her brother, Philip III of France. At the same time, queen Violant sought support for her grandchildren from her brother, King Peter III of Aragon, who agreed to protect and guard them in the kingdom of Aragon, accommodating her grandchildren in the Castle of Xativa. During the reign of her son Sancho IV, and the latter's son, Ferdinand IV of Castile, Queen Violant lived almost permanently in Aragon and she supported the rights to the throne of Castile and Le√≥n of her grandson, Alfonso de la Cerda. In 1276, Violant founded the Convent of San Pablo in Valladolid. This was erected in honor of the Hungarian Order of St. Paul. Violant's mother brought some Hungarian influence on the Spanish culture, and also introduced the Order of St. Paul. Queen Violant died in Roncesvalles, Navarre, in 1301, on her return from Rome, where she had won the Jubilee in 1300. Children Coat of arms of Violant of Aragon as Queen Consort of Castile. Alfonso and Violant had the following children: # Berengaria (1253 ‚Äì after 1284). She was betrothed to Louis, the son and heir of King Louis IX of France, but her fianc√© died prematurely in 1260.

The Victorian Model Solar Vehicle Challenge is a competition held annually at Scienceworks in Melbourne, Australia. The challenge gives school age children a chance to design and build a car or boat, and more recently a Mars Rover, that operates solely on solar power. It is run by MSV, a voluntary organisation created to administer the challenge.  History  A solar car challenge for schools' was first thought of in 1987 during the first World Solar Challenge. Everyone who attended‚Äîcar makers, staff and students from universities and secondary schools‚Äîbelieved it to be a great experience. Two men, Paul Wellington (teacher at Chisholm Institute of Technology, part of Monash University), and Ted Mellor (Warragul Technical School), felt that such an opportunity should be available to a wider range of students, because at the time, the high cost of making a life-size solar car meant that only rich schools could afford it. Thus, it was decided that a competition for model solar cars would be created; model cars being much cheaper and less time-consuming to make than life-size cars, but still requiring the same amount of thought and skill. Paul and Ted assembled a team of science and technology teachers, curriculum developers, sponsors, representatives and former World Solar Challenge team members (today known as MSV), and with the financial support of Energy Victoria, they established a Model Solar Car Challenge in Victoria. The first race was run in May 1990, at the Exhibition Buildings in Melbourne.

Li became the chief of staff of Wang's Chinese People's National Salvation Army one of the most successful of the volunteer armies resisting the Japanese and its puppet state of Manchukuo. He was also said to have been secretly organizing communists within the army. Yet Party policy at the time opposed the volunteer armies and the participation of members in them and had their own Northeastern People's Revolutionary Army. At first the Party severely criticised their conduct yet the stance of the Party prevented the growth of their own forces and did not help the anti-Japanese cause. In 1933, when Wang was defeated by the Japanese and fled Manchuria, Li remained with the remnant NSA forces, now dispersed in small guerrilla bands. There he organized a unit from former NSA troops for the Northeastern People's Revolutionary Army in the Ning'an area and continued the struggle against the Japanese. In 1934, there were still resistance forces estimated at 50,000 men still in the field. All the Communist Party units were reorganized into the single Northeast Anti- Japanese United Army, with Zhao Shangzhi as its Commander-in-Chief. It was now to be open to all who wanted to resist the Japanese invasion and proclaimed its willingness to ally with all other anti-Japanese forces, this won over some of the shanlin bands, including former NSA units. In 1935, when the party officially changed policy, and began creating a united front, the army welcomed and absorbed most of the remaining anti-Japanese forces in Manchuria. The army was now organized into three Route Armies including Zhou Baozhong's 2nd Route Army in Kirin Province, where Li was an officer. From the fall of 1936 to 1938 Li was sent Shanghai and Nanjing to engage in Anti-Japanese United Front work. In 1939 was appointed to the Central Committee of the CCP Northeast Working Committee as a vice-president. He was responsible to train the cadre to be sent to operate in the Northeast. After the victory in the Sino-Japanese War he was made vice governor of Sungkiang province in Manchuria. After the People's Republic of China had been established, he was appointed Heilongjiang Province assistant deputy governor and was the province Political Consultative Conference vice-president. He died after an illness in 1985, after he composed his revolutionary reminiscences of Communist Party history.

He was the nephew of Cardinal Francesco Napoleone Orsini (1295‚Äì1312), who was himself the nephew of Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini).Touron, p. 201. Eugenio Gamurrini, Istoria genealogica delle famiglie nobili Toscana et Umbre (Florence 1671), pp. 19-20. His early studies were at Bologna, where he studied law and took the Baccalaureate.Pius Thomas Masetti, Monumenta et antiquitates veteris disciplinae Ordinis Praedicatorum I (Romae 1864), p. 316. Touron, p. 202. He was Canon of the Church of S. Etienne in Ch√¢lons sur Sa√¥ne.Pius Thomas Masetti, Monumenta et antiquitates veteris disciplinae Ordinis Praedicatorum I (Romae 1864), p. 312. He entered the Dominican Order at the Convent of S. Jacques in Paris, around 1294, and completed the full course of theology. He returned to Italy, but the Provincial of the Roman Province sent him back to Paris in 1306, where he obtained the Degree of Master. He taught biblical studies at Paris,The Acta Capitulorum of 1315 states: Assignamus ad legendum sentencias Parisius isto anno fratrem Mattheum de Ursinis; et providemus, quantum nostra interest, de Fratre Michaele de Furno, quod legat sentencias Parisius in anno sequenti. In other words, Orsini was assigned for one year to teach bible at the Paris Convent of the Dominicans. B. Reichert, Monumenta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum historica Tomus IV (Roma 1899), p. 86. Florence, and Rome. In 1311 he attended the Capitulum Generale in Naples as socius ('companion') of the Definitor (elected delegate) of the Roman Province, the Provincial Fr. Lapus Cerli.Masetti, pp. 307-311. In 1314, the Capitulum Generale at London appointed him Vicar for the itinerant preachers of the Order.Masetti, p. 312. After teaching in Paris in 1316 Fr. Matteo Orsini, OP, is held to have taught at the Dominican studium generale at the Convent of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. This would have meant that he was an in-house teacher in a Dominican convent studium: instructors in Philosophy were called Lector, instructors in Theology were called Magister; he was not a University Regent Master.Pius Thomas Masetti, Monumenta et antiquitates veteris disciplinae Ordinis Praedicatorum I (Romae 1864), pp. 142-153. He was Prior of the Convent of the Minerva. He won distinction by his zeal for the spread of the Order, and was elected Provincial of the Roman Province in 1322 in the provincial Chapter at Orvieto.Lorenzo Cardella, Memorie delle cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa Tomo 2 (Roma 1792), p. 129. In 1323, during a meeting of the Chapter of the Roman Province at Citt√† di Castello (Tiferno), he and the Definitores were attacked by a deranged novice, Fr. Jacobus Dombellinghi, who injured Fr. Matteo with his sword.Masetti, p. 313, derived from the Acta of the Roman Province. He attended the General Chapter of the Order at Bordeaux in June 1324. On his return from the General Chapter he fell into a serious illness which almost cost him his life.Masetti, p. 313. In 1326, Fr. Matteo was relieved of his duty as Provincial of the Roman Province and succeeded by Fr. Bertramus Monaldeschi, who was elected by the General Chapter meeting in Paris.Masetti, p. 318. Fr. Matteo was appointed Vicar for the Master General in Italy.Touron, p. 202. Masetti, p. 312. On his duties, see Daniel Antonin Mortier, Histoire des Ma√Ætres g√©n√©raux de l'Ordre des Fr√®res Pr√™cheurs III (Paris 1907), p. 23-24. Orsini's service as Vicar of the Master General was short-lived. On 20 October 1326, the pope named Matteo Orsini, OP, Bishop of Girgenti (Agrigento), in Sicily, and then, six months later (15 June 1327), transferred him to the archiepiscopal see of Siponto, (Manfredonia, Southern Italy).Pompeo Sarnelli, Cronologia de' vescovi ed Archvescovi Sipontini (Manfredonia 1680), pp. 235-239. :it:Arcidiocesi di Manfredonia-Vieste-San Giovanni Rotondo (in Italian) He arrived in Siponto on 22 April 1327, according to Pompeo Sarnelli,Pompeo Sarnelli, Cronologia de' vescovi ed Archvescovi Sipontini (Manfredonia 1680), p. 237. which is completely impossible chronologically, since Fr. Matteo was not appointed until 15 June 1327. And in any case he was named a cardinal in December 1327, and on 11 January 1328 a successor to him at Siponto was appointed by Pope John XXII.Eubel, p. 453. In 1326, the difficulties over the office of Emperor between the Habsburgs and the Wittelsbach Louis the Bavarian brought increased danger to the city of Rome. The Pope was still hostile to Louis, having excommunicated him repeatedly, and yet Louis intended to be crowned King of the Lombards and Holy Roman Emperor, which involved a visit to Italy and especially Rome. The Romans, fearing that they would be the target of Louis' wrath, wanted the Pope back in Rome.J.-B. Christophe, Histoire de la Papaut√© pendant le XIVe si√®cle Tome premier (Paris 1853), pp. 362-365. The government authorized the vicars in Rome of King Robert the Wise of Naples, Pandulf Count of Anguillara and Annibaldo de Annibaldis, to write to the Pope, rehearsing the difficulties that Rome was suffering because of the absence of the Pope and Roman Curia, and demanding his immediate return. John XXII wrote to the Romans on 20 January 1327, expressing his loving concern, but also indicating obstacles to a visit. He also wrote to Giacomo Savelli in Rome,Savelli, the Papal Vicar in temporalibus in Rome, had been ousted in the autumn of 1326. Gregorovius VI, p. 105. urging him to keep the Romans from offering obedience to Louis of Bavaria. The Romans replied with an embassy. While holding the post of Provincial of the Roman Province Fr. Matteo Orsini was appointed an Ambassador (Orator)probably in the autumn of 1326. His success at deftly scolding the Pope, and yet maintaining the papal dignity and not embarrassing him, may have led to Fr. Matteo's appointment as Bishop of Agrigento. of the embassy deputed by the Romans to invite John XXII to transfer his residence back to Rome from Avignon.F. Ughelli-N. Colet, Italia sacra (Venice 1721), p. 844, places this embassy in 1325. In answer to Fr. Matteo Orsini's addresses, the Pope replied to the Romans again in a letter of 8 June 1327, emphasizing the danger that Louis the Bavarian represented, and the impossibility of travelling to Rome just at that time. A second embassy was sent in June, more for form's sake, advising the Pope of what they were going to be compelled to do, than in expectation of action.Gregorovius VI, p. 136. J.-B. Christophe, Histoire de la Papaut√© pendant le XIVe si√®cle Tome premier (Paris 1853), pp. 365-369. The expected revolution and change of government in Rome duly took place. Louis the Bavarian entered Rome, and was crowned at Saint Peter's, not by papal authority but by authority of the People of Rome. Despite this political disaster, Pope John XXII never went to Rome.Augustinus Theiner (Editor), Caesaris S. R. E. Cardinalis Baronii, Od. Raynaldi et Jac. Laderchii Annales Ecclesiastici Tomus Vigesimus Quartus, 1313‚Äì1333 (Barri-Ducis: Ludovicus Guerin 1872), under the year 1327, ¬ß 4-14, pp. 313-317 Pope John XXII made Orsini a cardinal along with nine others at the Consistory of 18 December 1327,Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi I editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 16. and assigned him the titular Church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo on Monte Celio. He was promoted to Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina on 18 December 1338 by Pope Benedict XII (1334‚Äì1342). This promotion was a matter of seniority, not virtue or merit.Eubel, p. 38. It is sometimes said that Cardinal Matteo Orsini was Archbishop of Palermo from 1334 to 1338.See Mortier, pp. 208-209. This is incorrect. His cousin, Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, the incumbent Archbishop since October 1320, did not die until 27 August 1335, and a successor, Archbishop Theobaldus, was appointed by Pope Benedict XII on 24 April 1336.Eubel, p. 388. The time span is therefore some eight months, not four or five years, and it was not ended by his promotion to the See of Sabina. As Eubel points out,Eubel p. 338, n. 9. Masetti, p. 315. Touron, p. 208. Cardinal Matteo was Administrator of the Diocese of Palermo during the Sede Vacante, not the actual Archbishop. After the death of Cardinal Pierre des Chappes on 24 March 1336, Cardinal Matteo became prior presbyterorum (Protopriest), as a matter of strict seniority and precedence. This was not an office, only a status. In documents issued in the name of the College of Cardinals, however, he was expected to sign and seal the document, along with the senior Cardinal-Bishop and senior Cardinal-Deacon. But in his absence, the next most senior cardinal took his place. The Cardinal continued, in various ways, to promote the welfare of the Dominican Order, richly endowing the Convent of St. Dominic in Bologna.Masetti, p. 315. Cardinal Matteo Orsini, OP, died in Avignon on 18 August 1340, and was buried in the Church of the Dominicans. His body was later transferred to Rome, where it was buried in the Sacristy of the Dominican church of S. Maria sopra Minerva.Touron, p. 211. He had built a chapel in honor of Saint Catherine of Siena in that church;Touron, p. 210. Masetti, pp. 315 and 317. the saint's remains now lie beneath the High Altar of S. Maria sopra Minerva. In 1630, when the Sacristy of the church was being renovated, Cardinal Matteo's remains were moved into the Church, and now lie in the same tomb as Cardinal Latino Malabranca Orsini, next to the statue of the Risen Christ, near the High Altar.

It used the trading name National Welsh and its Welsh equivalent Cymru Cenedlaethol.  History  National Welsh/Cymru Cenedlaethol in 1980 in Cardiff Central bus station. Preserved National Welsh/Cymru Cenedlaethol bus in Bristol. National Welsh had its origins in the Western Welsh Omnibus Company, formed in 1929 as a subsidiary of British Electric Traction. The Great Western Railway transferred its bus services in South and West Wales to the company and took a financial interest, hence the name. The railway interest passed to the British Transport Commission in 1948, but Western Welsh was not fully nationalised until 1967 when BET sold its bus interests to the Transport Holding Company. The company passed to the National Bus Company in 1969. In 1970 and 1971, the NBC transferred Western Welsh's operations west of Bridgend to its subsidiaries South Wales Transport and Crosville. In return Western Welsh took over the operations of Rhondda Transport. On 17 April 1978, the National Bus Company transferred the operations of its subsidiary Red & White Services to Western Welsh and renamed the merged company National Welsh/Cymru Cenedlaethol (the latter an incorrect translation, which should be Cymraeg Cenedlaethol). The company's area of operations thus became South-East Wales and the Forest of Dean area of Gloucestershire. In 1987, National Welsh was sold to its management, which struggled to make a profit. In January 1991, the Eastern Division of National Welsh, which included depots in Cwmbran, Crosskeys, Brynmawr and Chepstow, was sold to Western Travel Group. Western Travel renamed this division (with its outstations at Abergavenny, Brecon, Cinderford, Ross and Lydney), Red & White Services Ltd. The Company traded as Red & White and introduced a livery similar to National Welsh, but with a grey band instead of green. Bustler From 1986 to 1992, Bustler was the registered service name and brand used by National Welsh for a large fleet of minibuses in a chrome yellow livery, featuring blue, red and white stripes. Its key marker was the use of the stripes like wedding ribbons on the front bonnet. The van chassis were initially Iveco Daily, Freight Rover Sherpa and Ford Transits with conversions by Dormobile and Carlyle. Whilst comfort was not their strong point, the five- to ten-minute frequencies transformed patronage levels in the towns of Aberdare, Barry, Bridgend, Cwmbran, Ebbw Vale, Penarth, Pontypridd, Porth, and Tredegar. They were even seen in Newport and Cardiff. Five blue Bustlers were introduced in Pontypridd when the council run Taff-Ely (previously Pontypridd Urban District Council) operations were taken over. Bustlers also covered much of the Rhymney Valley when Inter-Valley Link Ltd (former Caerphilly UDC, Gelligaer UDC, and Bedwas & Machen UDC) operations went into receivership. Bustlers also entered Merthyr Tydfil in a big way causing a financial crisis for MTT, the privatised council bus service. All the Merthyr Tydfil Transport bus drivers resigned en masse and joined National Welsh as a block Bustler team. With minibuses being a cheaper form of bus operation, Bustlers were seen on tendered services in places like Monmouth and on two routes in Bristol for a time. The minibus catered for a commercial need at the time when many other privatised bus companies saw it as a way of maintaining market dominance and giving something the public wanted - a high frequency service without the need to consult a timetable. Problems occurred as passenger demand outstripped supply on a number of routes, and many of the vehicles did not last their pay-back period. None of the 500 odd Bustlers minibuses allowed wheelchair access and their nickname, by their detractors, summed them up as \\"bread vans with seats\\". However, in their yellow livery, the slogan of the time ran true - \\"Bustler - the brighter way to travel\\". The Bustler name (in a different typeface style) was also used by a former London Country Bus Services operation following privatisation, but the company agreed to remove the name within two years at the formal insistence of National Welsh. The Bustler name is now used for a paratransit service in Woking.  Insolvency and subsequent history  In early 1992 National Welsh, now without its Eastern Division, was placed into receivership - the main example of a failed bus privatisation. Upon the appointment of the Receivers, there was a widespread registration of nearly all National Welsh's routes, and this could have been a contributing factor for a buyer not being found for the business. Subsequently, the company's depots were closed or sold: *The routes of Bridgend and Tredegar depots were already being operated by Red & White and South Wales Transport, and they were closed. *Merthyr depot was sold to a new company, Offa Demo, owned by Cynon Valley Transport, which later took over Aberdare as well. These two depots were immediately closed and sold for property development. *Porth and Aberdare depots were sold to a new company, Rhondda Buses Ltd, and Aberdare was quickly sold on to Offa Demo. Rhondda Buses was created from a consortium of Stevensons of Uttoxeter, Julian Peddle, British Bus, Potteries Motor Traction and later Western Travel, owners of Red & White. At one time, Rhondda Buses was unique in being owned by the three big transport groups in the UK, due to later takeovers. Badgerline, which became part of FirstGroup, took over Potteries; Stagecoach Group purchased Western Travel; and British Bus was taken over by the Cowie Group in 1996, which later became Arriva. In December 1997, the entire company was taken over by Stagecoach, despite a rival bid from First. *Barry depot held its own in the Vale of Glamorgan, despite fierce competition from Cardiff Bus, but with Cardiff Bus running commercial services against National Welsh's tendered services, South Glamorgan County Council was legally obliged to remove any subsidy to National Welsh. A new operator's licence was granted to Barry Line Bus Co Ltd t/a Barry Line/Bustler, and an employee bid was launched for Barry depot. This was unsuccessful and the last remaining depot of National Welsh closed in June 1992, some 5 months after the closure of the other depots. On the demise of National Welsh, the name Bustler quickly vanished from the roads of South Wales. Stagecoach subsequently split the operations: the Welsh operations became part of Stagecoach in South Wales, and the Forest of Dean operations became Stagecoach in Wye and Dean, part of Stagecoach West.

Due to the backlash against musicals, it was apparently released in black-and-white only. Plot An American newspaper reporter named Charlie Carroll (Charles King) is sent to Venice to interview a Romanian general, who is played by Noah Beery. While in Venice Charlie falls for a young heiress named Nanette Dodge (Irene Delroy). When Charlie is unable to get an interview with the Romanian general, a local siren named Kunegundi (Vivien Oakland), who is the general's favorite helps him. Meanwhile, Nanette learns that her sister is being blackmailed by Prince Kasloff of Russia (Lowell Sherman), to whom she wrote some incriminating letters. Nanette attempts to vamp the Prince in order to obtain the love letters. The Prince, however, tricks her and demands that Nanette marry him if she wants to save her sister. After being repeatedly rebuked by Nanette, the prince hires the Romanian general (Noah Beery) to kidnap her and force her into marriage. Charlie, thinking she has eloped, consoles himself with Kunegundi (Vivien Oakland) and almost marries her until he realizes the truth about Nanette and that she has been kidnapped by the Prince. Charlie sets out to rescue her and when the Prince shows up disguised as the general he shoots Prince Kasloff. Charlie and Nanette are happily reunited. Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson provide comic relief that is completely unrelated to the main story. They play the part of two American sailors stationed in Naples who attempt to find a wooden-legged thief who has robbed the navy storehouse in Venice.

The other side of Brunswick 4849 featured a song from the aborted MGM revue The March of Time (1930). *This was to be Charles King's last musical movie. He went back to the Broadway stage, since movie audiences had grown tired of musicals, and never returned to the screen. *Due to the public apathy towards musicals, Warner Bros. did not debut this film in the usual prestigious movie theaters. The film was immediately placed in general release with no fanfare. *Comedians Olsen and Johnson were added to the film due to growing public apathy towards serious stage actors such as King and Delroy. The movie was marketed as a comedy film with these comics billed as \\"America's funniest clowns\\". Preservation The version of the film released in the United States, late in 1930, survives intact.

Biography  Gudzowaty graduated from the Faculty of Foreign Trade at the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ University. From 1975 to 1979, he acted for two leading Polish foreign trade enterprises representing the entire Polish textile industry in Moscow. From 1978 to 1993, he served as Director General of PHZ Kolmex S.A. - a railway sector company; during that time he executed one of their largest contracts ever to supply freight wagons for Iraqi Railways. Having left PHZ Kolmex S.A., in 1992 Gudzowaty set up the Bartimpex commodity trading operation, and in so doing leveraged his Russian relationships. He had vast experience in trade with the Middle East, the CIS and Russia. He was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the wealthiest and most influential people in the Central and Eastern Europe. His attempt to diversify into financial services ended after JV along with US insurer Cigna were dissolved and the bank BWE was divested to the private equity firm Innova Capital. Industrial assets controlled by Gudzowaty included Akwawit-Brasco, the alcohol and biofuel producer, which was acquired in a controversial privatisation deal. Gudzowaty was most recently involved in funding the Tolerance Monument which is being raised in Jerusalem by sculptors Michal Kubiak and Czeslaw Dzwigaj. Gudzowaty died on 14 February 2013 at the age of 74.

In 1922 changed its name to Poor Law Officers Union, in 1930 to the National Union of County Officers (NUCO), and in 1943 to the Hospital and Welfare Services Union. It was Vincent Evans (1889-1946), a deputy clerk at the Paddington Board of Guardians, who in 1918 was responsible for convening the first meeting of Poor Law staff to consider forming a union. The first General Secretary was Archibald Milne, an Assistant General Relieving Officer at Willsden Board of Guardians, but he was soon replaced by Vincent Evans. Guilds The union developed a unique and successful sectional or \\"guild\\" system of union organisation, the most successful of which was the NUCO's Guild of Nurses, set up in October 1937. However, the union also had \\"guilds\\" for medical staff, ambulance staff and ancillary staff. The guild system continued into the early days of COHSE. NUCO Guild of Nurses was led by nurses such as Iris Brook (Guild of Nursing organiser from 1937), Doris Westmacott, and Deptford Councillor Beatrice Drapper. It organised a Masked Nurses protest on 26 November 1937, where nurses in white uniform with white masks marched through London and were prevented by the police from entering the City of London. 500 attended a meeting at St Pancras Town Hall addressed by George Lansbury demanding a 96 hour fortnight.

IBED employs more than 100 researchers, with PhD students and Postdocs forming a majority, and 30 supporting staff. The total annual budget is around 10 m‚Ç¨, of which more than 40 per cent comes from external grants and contracts. The main output consist of publications in peer reviewed journals and books (on average 220 per year). Each year around 15 PhD students defend their thesis and obtain their degree from the Universiteit van Amsterdam. The institute is managed by a general director appointed by the Dean of the Faculty for a period of five years, assisted by a business manager. Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is to increase our insights in the functioning and biodiversity of ecosystems in all their complexity. Knowledge of the interactions between living organisms and processes in their physical and chemical environment is essential for a better understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales. Organization of IBED Research IBED research is organized in the following three themes: =Theme I: Biodiversity and Evolution= The main question of Theme I research is how patterns in biodiversity can be explained from underlying processes: speciation and extinction, dispersal and the (dis)appearance of geographical barriers, reproductive isolation and hybridisation of taxa. Modern reconstructions of the history of life on earth rely heavily on analyses of DNA data that contain the footprints of the past. Research related to human-made effects on biodiversity includes the identification of endangered biodiversity hotspots affected by global change, potential risks of an escape of transgenes from crops to wild species, and the consequences of habitat fragmentation for the viability and genetic diversity of populations and species. =Theme II: Geo- ecology= Research in Theme II concentrates on the physical and chemical properties of the environment, and how these affect the living organisms in an ecosystem. The spatial and temporal scale ranges from fluxes at the molecular level to the reconstruction of Quaternary climate change in different continents. Research related to human effects on ecosystems includes the fate of chemical pollutants in the system, CO2 sequestering, nutrient fluxes and soil fertility and the effects of land use on erosion and desertification. =Theme III: Community Dynamics= Research in Theme III aims to understand the dynamics of natural communities given the diversity and behaviour of the organisms present in the system. Individual variation - for instance in developmental stage or in genetic response - can have a major impact on the stability of complex biological systems. The research of Theme III has many applications: control of pests and plagues, prevention of toxic algal blooms, managing fish populations by harvesting and restocking, and control of turbidity in aquatic systems. Organization of IBED Education IBED is closely involved in several BSc and MSc programmes of the Universiteit van Amsterdam. Especially the MSc programmes that are taught in English are highly integrated within the research of IBED.

History The Taiwan Review was established in April 1951 under the name Free China Review ‚Äì as opposed to the communist Chinese mainland ‚Äì and at that time was the first ROC government-funded English-language publication targeting overseas readers. The Free China Review title stayed for half a century before it was renamed Taipei Review in April 2000, and finally Taiwan Review in March 2003 to better reflect the origin of the publication.  Content  For more than half a century, the magazine has been the periodical of record concerning Taiwan's socio-economic development, as well as its democratization, through in-depth reports, features and commentaries. The 65-page periodical was the flagship publication of the Government Information Office until the GIO was formally dissolved on May 20, 2012, under a government restructuring program. Management of the monthly magazine then came under the newly formed Department of International Information Services of the R.O.C.‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Taiwan Review is a credible source of information for academics in East Asian studies, and an engaging read for whoever takes an interest in trends and events that shape the lives of the Taiwanese people. The Taiwan Review Facebook website states: \\"The Taiwan Review provides in-depth discussion of various aspects of Taiwan including politics, economics, society, the environment and the arts.\\" Other-language versions The Taiwan Review publishes in English, French, German, Spanish and Russian.

In 1710 he went to Dresden where he was instrumental in securing the conversion of the future King Augustus III of Poland from Lutheranism to Roman Catholicism. He continued to be active in papal diplomacy until the 1740s. As a patron of ecclesiastical literature, he left a valuable library, a gallery of paintings and sculpture, and a cabinet of coins that eventually was added to the Vatican collection.

Consisting of Zerak, Zintar and Zobor, the Zeroids powered their way into the imaginations of young boys for nearly a decade. Zeroid robots were powered by a small DC electric motor that could be removed. These DC motors appeared as the brand name \\"Motorific\\" in Ideal Corp racing slot cars, and \\"Boaterific\\" powered scale motorboats. The original sales pitch read, \\"Moving across the landscape, overrunning all obstacles as inexorably as the Future itself, these amazing, efficient and powerful automatons have but one purpose - to serve their masters at work and play!\\" The storage cases in which the robots came could be used for other purposes. The robots were battery operated, and had wheels with rubber treads to propel themselves across the floor. There was a bottom mounted reversing switch that would allow the robot to reverse when it touched a special plastic plate, or turn the robot off, when in backed up into its display case. Zerak, the blue robot, was originally the \\"commander\\" of the three robots. Zerak came with hook hands, and interchangeable magnetic hand and a throwing cup hand. Zerak's right arm could be cocked, and made to throw objects. Zobor, the \\"Bronze\\" Robot, could \\"transport\\" lightweight items in his storage case, which could be \\"transformed\\" into a wagon due to having wheels attached to it. The case/wagon could be latched to a hook on Zobor's base. Zobor had a throwing arm and special spring-loaded plier type clamp hands. Zintar, the silver \\"explorer\\", could use his storage case as a sled-like vehicle, which was propelled by his own treads. Zintar had a throwing arm and special hands with spring-loaded opposable thumbs. Zintar was cast in both a silver sparkled plastic and also in plain light gray plastic. Later, \\"Zogg\\", a green robot was added to the set, and replaced Zerak as the commander of the zeroids. Zogg had powered drive treds, and was the first zeroid with an internal light bulb. Zogg did not have a throwing arm. Zogg had a sophisticated-looking \\"station\\" which had movable parts, activated by Zogg's metal \\"hands\\" completing an electric circuit. The station had, among other things, a \\"radar\\" that would rotate, and a spiral design 'monitor\\" which would spin when Zogg would complete the electric circuit. An \\"Action Set\\" was available with a Missile Defense Pad, launching station, and included a \\"Solar Cycle\\" hollow wheel, into which the zeroid robot could be set inside. The Zeroid alien robot was a box shaped robot with a clear dome head and powered drive. It had changeable internal nylon gears that would alter the robots movements with pre-programmed patterns. One pattern ended with the robots \\"exploding\\" with the arms and parts springing off. There was a brief distribution of a Zeroid flying saucer called the ZEM XXI Explorer Module, cast in yellow and purple, or yellow and green, with a full sized powered Zeroid inside. Zeroids were later packaged without their case, on a bubble card with and without a solar cycle. Foreign distribution (U.K.) of Zeroids included a figure called Zemo, a composite robot with a Zintar head, Zerak chest and Zobor body. Zemo was sold in a wagon type carry case similar to the Zobor robot. Zemo was cast in aqua, red or orange-yellow plastic versions. Late 1970s \\"Star Team\\" Revival Zeroids returned to the shelves in the late 1970s, renamed \\"Star Team\\", to capitalize on the success of Star Wars. The Star Team line featured the \\"Zeroid Pilot\\", a smaller R2-D2-style dome-headed robot. Made from the lower body mold of the Zogg figure, it did not have the motorific DC drive motor. The batteries only powered a dome light. The \\"Pilot\\" was cast in silver plastic, in red or blue trim, and without the electronic contacts in the arms. The ZEM XXI Flying Saucer was re-issued as the \\"Star Hawk\\" in red and grey plastic, with a non- powered Zeroid with red trim. The other star team robot was a humanoid \\"Zem 21\\" green-headed silver-bodied figure that bore some resemblance to C-3PO. They fought the Darth-Vader-esque \\"Knight of Darkness\\", which was an Ideal Captain Action body molded in black. 2010 Moonstone Books Revival In 2010, the Zeroids returned in the pages of Moonstone Books' original comic book series in association with Captain Action Enterprises. \\"The original robots from space have returned to Earth! The Zeroids robots are back to help save mankind! Returning after a decades-long exile, the Zeroids return to find the descendant of their creator Professor Zero. Destiny Zero, a female college sophomore, needs all the help she can get as her world is overrun by the alien Shadow Raiders and their evil Zombies.\\" \\"Now, in much like an action movie version of Dorothy and her friends from OZ, Destiny unites with Zintar,Zerak, Zobor and Zogg to combine the fun retro appeal of nostalgic robots with cutting edge explosive adventure!\\" 2016 Toyfinity Revival As part of their licensing package in 2013, Toyfinity acquired the rights to Robo Force, Manglor, Rocks & Bugs & Things, and Zeroids/STAR Team from former Ideal Toy Company.http://www.collectiondx.com/article/interview_john_kent_toyfinity Compatible with the Glyos System Series designed by Onell Design, the kits mixed Robo Force kits featuring 41 or more pieces with Zeroids kits featuring 16 or more pieces with a figure which can be arranged and re-arranged in any way the user sees fit. Key philosophical differences between Zintar and Zerak, without the firm claws of Commander Zogg to guide them, have led to different evolutionary paths for these mechanical wonders. The tribes of the Prime Zeroids have gone their own ways, interacting very little over the interceding years. Guidance under the gaze of Zintar pushed their advancement into Neo Zeroids. =Figures= Prime Zeroids * Ancient Constructs - Ancient mechanical beings from beyond the stars ** Creator - A Gold deluxe figure with no paint applications.

Background Weinstein has been leader of the Canadian JDL since the late 1970s, but formerly used the pseudonym \\"Meir Halevi\\". He joined the JDL, at the age of 20, after reading Meir Kahane's book Never Again. Previously an assimilated Jew, Weinstein began attending synagogue regularly, began studying Jewish texts and became more involved in the Jewish community as a result of reading Kahane's book. He founded the Toronto JDL branch in 1979.Ira Basen, \\"Shock troops of the faith\\", Globe and Mail, November 28, 1981 He told the Jewish Press in 2008: \\"I will always be a loyal disciple of Rabbi Kahane. Our ideology is based on the Jewish Idea as taught by Rabbi Kahane.\\"Sidman, Fern, Jewish defense north of the border , Jewish Press, August 20, 2008 Under his leadership, the Canadian JDL has held annual commemorations honoring Kahane's life and ideas. In the 1980s and early 1990s Weinstein and the JDL were involved in identifying alleged Nazi war criminals living in Canada as well as neo-Nazi activity.Andre Picard, \\"Jewish group vows to identify suspects\\", The Globe and Mail, January 14, 1988 The group became dormant until Weinstein revived it in 2006 in the wake of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The revived JDL has focussed on opposing what it views as growing radical Islamic influence and anti-Israel activity. Weinstein is a trained bodyguard and served in the Israel Defense Forces. In Alberta In the mid-1980s, Weinstein travelled to Alberta on several occasions in an attempt to organize the Jewish community against antisemitic activity in the province - particularly, against the activities of Aryan Nations organizer Terry Long. He received national media attention in 1986 when he picketed \\"AryanFest\\" when it was held on Long's Alberta compound.Fisher, Matthew, \\"Jewish group vows to stop Aryan camp\\", Globe and Mail, August 23, 1986 The previous year, Weinstein had held meetings in Edmonton in an attempt to organize a JDL branch there. During one of the meetings he shouted down Rabbi Haim Kemelman, leader of Edmonton's Beth Shalom synagogue, after he criticized the JDL's methods and called Weinstein a \\"carpetbagger\\" and alleged he was trumping up a non- existent crisis of antisemitism in an attempt create an Edmonton JDL branch. \\"Those kinds of rabbis, those kind of Jews, in the end they dig a grave for Jews,\\" said Weinstein who accused the rabbi of being \\"rude and extremist\\". \\"You see, I am silenced,\\" the rabbi was reported as saying to a reporter after the incident, adding, \\"that is the JDL.\\"\\"Verbal barbs fly at meeting of JDL\\", Globe and Mail, October 21, 1985 In 1986, an editorial in The Globe and Mail criticized Weinstein (under his pseudonym of Meir Halevi) for claiming that the Alberta government was aiding neo-nazi Terry Long: \\"to say, as Mr. Halevi does, that this group exists with the assistance of the provincial government is simply a lie. And to advocate, as he does, any means legal or illegal to destroy the Aryan Nations group is irresponsible.\\"Editorial: Enter the vigilantes, The Globe and Mail, August 26, 1986 On Baruch Goldstein In 1994, in his capacity as Canadian spokesman for the banned Israeli political party Kach, Weinstein, using his pseudonym of Meir Halevi, commented on the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre committed by Kach member Baruch Goldstein in Hebron saying \\"[o]ur organization does not condemn the attack. It condemns the Israeli government for not providing adequate protection for settlers.\\" He added that Kach does not advocate physical attacks on Palestinians but that it wants all members of terrorist organizations expelled from Israel.

Why People Believe Weird Things. 1997, page 185 while trying to break into the property of Ernst Z√ºndel, a Holocaust denier. No charges have ever been laid in the incident.Linda Deutsch, \\"U.S. Jewish militants charged in bomb plot: Los Angeles mosque, congressman's office were intended targets\\", Ottawa Citizen, December 13, 2001 Protest at Palestine House In 2002, during the Canadian JDL's inactive period, Weinstein organized another group called the United Israel Action Committee which organized two demonstrations outside of Palestine House in Mississauga, Ontario. At the second demonstration the pro-Palestinian counterdemonstrators were joined by 20 children. Palestine House president Rashad Saleh said the demonstrators \\"should be the ones who should be ashamed. (They) are coming here and terrorizing our little children.\\"Bob Mitchell, \\"Protest leads to shouting match\\", Toronto Star, April 15, 2002 Weinstein argued that the children had been brought out as \\"pawns\\" by Palestine House and claimed that the organization his group was picketing used its charitable status to fund the Palestine Liberation Organization. \\"The people standing across the street are those who support the murders of Jews,\\" said Weinstein to a reporter. 2007 Newmarket mosque dispute In 2007, Weinstein helped organize a town hall session to raise questions about the connections of a mosque in Newmarket, Ontario with Zafar Bangash. The controversial imam has promoted sharia law and vigorously defended Iran's fundamentalist regime and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement. The mosque spokesperson denied that Bangash will have anything to do with the day-to-day running of the mosque.Freed, Dale Anne, \\"Newmarket mosque meeting 'one-sided'; Executive member says leadership not invited to meeting, adding they don't share controversial imam's views\\", Toronto Star, February 26, 2007 The meeting was criticized as \\"one-sided\\" because no officials from the mosque were invited. John Thompson, president of the Mackenzie Institute, was one of the featured speakers at the town hall. He told the Toronto Star that he was invited by Ron Banerjee, one of the organizers, but would have \\"called in with the flu\\" had he known Weinstein would be there because of his association with the JDL. Weinstein found himself on the defensive at the meeting, according to the National Post, after he implied that a town councillor had accepted a bribe. Newmarket resident Brian Patterson said of Weinstein: \\"I don't think he has any credibility at all. To suggest at a public meeting that any public official in this town has taken a bribe without any evidence of that is outrageous.\\"Tom Blackwell, \\"'Town hall' targets Newmarket mosque: Jewish group leading protest has checkered past of its own\\", National Post, February 26, 2007 In his arguments against the mosque, Weinstein told the audience of about 30, \\"[i]f, God forbid, an Islamic state ever came to fruition in this country, we would be doomed. Is that what you want in this country?\\" Clash with Paul Fromm A 2007 demonstration against Paul Fromm while he was on his way to a disciplinary hearing at the Ontario College of Teachers resulted in the arrest of two JDL activists who were accused of assaulting the controversial far- right figure. Weinstein, himself, was not reported to have been involved in the incident. He told the Globe and Mail that the arrests were \\"not going to be a setback for us and we're determined to see to it that Nazis will not teach hate in classrooms.\\"Mahoney, Jill, \\"Activists confront controversial educator: Demonstrators charged as scuffle erupts over ex-teacher tied to white supremacists\\", Globe and Mail, April 20, 2007 George Galloway In 2009, Weinstein's JDL issued an \\"open letter\\" to the Canadian government calling for the British politician George Galloway to be barred from entering Canada. The government did so and Weinstein appeared on Britain's Channel 4 News to debate with Galloway over the issue. During the interview, Weinstein accused Galloway of being a \\"proxy agent\\" of Hamas and Hezbollah. When Galloway stated that he would be speaking in Canada through \\"other means\\", electronic if necessary, Weinstein threatened that \\"we will see to it that the Canadian government will be monitoring every individual and organization that will have anything to do with it\\" and that he and the JDL \\"will be looking into these organizations that invited him‚Ä¶ their links to terror groups as well\\" and that he will \\"see to it that the Canadian Government will be monitoring every individual and organization that has anything to do with George Galloway\\". CBC pointed out, that Meir Weinstein himself was a spokesperson of the Kach Party in 1994 despite the Kach Party being on Canada's branded list of terrorist organizations. Weinstein denied that he ever was a member of the Kach party or Kahane Chai, insisting he was just the spokesman. \\"Death to the Arabs\\" On April 3, 2009, CBC Radio's The World Report carried a profile on Weinstein which asserted that a link was discovered on Weinstein's Facebook page to a chat group called \\"Death to Arabs\\". Weinstein told CBC the link had been sent to him in Hebrew and he added it not knowing what it said.YouTube upload of CBC News report, April 3, 2009 English Defence League In 2011, Weinstein's Jewish Defence League organized a \\"support rally\\" for the controversial English Defence League featuring a live speech, via Skype, by EDL leader Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who uses the alias Tommy Robinson. The event was denounced by the Canadian Jewish Congress whose leader, Bernie Farber, said he was \\"disappointed that the JDL would support an organization whose record in the U.K. is one of violence and extremism.\\"\\"Anti-Islamic group from U.K. to hold rally\\" , National Post, January 6, 2011 \\"We join with all the leading British Jewish organizations in condemning the intolerance and violence that the EDL represents. It has never been the Canadian way to promote vigilantism,\\" added Farber.\\"'Islamophobic' group draws fierce protests\\" , National Post, January 12, 2011 In an opinion piece published following the event, Farber and CJC general counsel Benjamin Shinewald castigated the JDL stating that, \\"By joining forces [with the English Defence League], the JDL condones the indefensible actions of violent extremists.\\"\\"Troubling marriage for T.O. Jews\\", Toronto Sun, January 12, 2011 The rally, held at the Toronto Zionist Centre, attracted a counter-protest organized by Anti-Racist Action resulting in four arrests. RCMP investigate JDL Canada for alleged bomb plot On October 5, 2011 on the Michael Coren show it was revealed that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had launched an investigation against at least nine members of the Canadian JDL in regards to an anonymous tip that the JDL was plotting to bomb Palestine House in Mississauga. Meir Weinstein reported that many members of the JDL were interviewed extensively, at home and at work and suggested that the RCMP was surveilling their activity. Weinstein denied that the plot existed and accused the RCMP of political bias. Violence outside Washington DC AIPAC conference Weinstein organized a group of JDL members and supporters to go to Washington, D.C. in March 2017 to counterprotest against anti-Zionist groups protesting the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference, resulting in several brawls. At least two Canadian JDL supporters have been indicted as a result of alleged violence outside the conference. Yosef Steynovitz was charged with one count of assaulting a man with a dangerous weapon, one count of assaulting a second man, and one count of assault with a hate crimes enhancement for causing significant bodily injury in relation to the beating of Kamal Nayfeh, a 55-year-old Palestinian-American community college teacher who was reportedly walking to the conference when he was attacked.http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/canadian-jdl-member-indicted- allegedly-beating-palestinian-d-c Rami Lubranicki, 59, of Howell, New Jersey was also charged. On April 20, 2018, a second Canadian JDL supporter, Brandon David William Vaughan, was arraigned in relation with the Washington D.C. assaults the previous year.https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/ottawa- man-charged-with-hate-crime-in-washington-d-c-attack Weinstein claimed that his members acted in \\"self-defence\\" saying of the beating victims \\"They found out that it‚Äôs not wise to lay not even a finger on any of us. Anyone who‚Äôs going to try and raise a fist to us, push us and assault us, we would be glad to enforce a citizen‚Äôs arrest when there‚Äôs some semblance of cooperation from the aggressor. Unfortunately, we had to resort to a certain level of force, and we made it very clear the days of Jews being attacked and being docile are long over.\\"https://nowtoronto.com/news/toronto-anti-muslim-hate-jewish- defence-league/ However, there is no evidence that the victims had engaged in any form of violence.

Its mission is \\"to contribute to the establishment of peaceful societies, fair and self-sufficient in Africa, to strengthen the political dialogue for the peaceful resolution of conflicts, contribute to the consolidation of democratic processes and institutions, and to encourage artistic creativity, social and economic\\" throughout Africa. The institute, born from an idea formulated by Senegalese president Abdou Diouf, was founded June 25, 1992. It was established in the wake of a historic June 1987 meeting in Dakar, between the exiled leadership of the African National Congress and a group of liberal South Africans, mostly Afrikaners, from the business world, civil society, politics, religion and academia. Subsequently known as \\"the Dakar meeting,\\" the gathering was one of many that opened the way for a negotiated end to apartheid in South Africa. The constitutional and legal environment within which the Institute has since then operated was made possible by the formal statute granted by the government of Senegal in 1991, as an expression of its commitment to allow Goree Institute to work in the challenging but free-minded \\"democratic space\\" of an off-shore Pan-African public interest organisation. Alongside its activities of research, training and facilitation, the centre has set up a section exclusively tasked with the responsibility of hosting summits, researches and artists that in their work contributes to the general mission of the institute. This section, The Teral, provides conferences and sabbatical facilities on Gor√©e. The Executive Director is Doudou Dia, and Ayo Obe is chairperson of the Board of Trustees.

It designates a postponed linking of an object with its prototype (class) until it is needed. If used properly, such approach may increase efficiency, simplicity and flexibility of OOP-based code written using JavaScript. Since lazy inheritance called only once at the moment of first object instance creation, it seems logical to combine process of class prototype creation with resolving necessary dependencies of that class. The instances of objects in lazy inheritance are created in \\"mixed\\" mode ‚Äî on first invocation, a factory is used to modify class prototype which is later used for subsequent object instances creation. In other words, the process of prototype construction also allows loading scripts (if ones were not loaded before) which particular class depends on. Such approach to inheritance support has the following benefits: *Lazy inheritance has the same benefits as classical JavaScript prototype features; * It is not necessary to maintain proper order of script files declaration; * In most cases, HTML page which contains JavaScript is loaded faster since there are no objects created during page initialization and since some scripts could be loaded only at the moment in which they are actually necessary (they are necessary if the caller code during its execution really creates instances of corresponding classes); * Dependencies are declared in more explicit way and class depends only on concrete scripts; Moreover, it's not necessary to artificially group particular scripts into modules and define dependencies between such modules; * If lazy mode of scripts loading is used, only necessary scripts (which are actually required for application functionality) will be loaded. If, for example, some HTML page may operate in different modes, like \\"read-write\\" and \\"read-only\\", for every mode required scripts will be loaded and this will be performed automatically without manual script loading optimization.

It offers both primary and secondary education on one campus. The school first opened in August 2008 after replacing another ESF school, Bauhinia School, which first opened in January 2002. Discovery College has five houses, and provides education from year 1 to year 13. Discovery College was established by the English Schools Foundation to serve the needs of the local and expatriate communities in Hong Kong. It is a full Years 1 to 13 school offering the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) for Years 1-6, Middle Years Programme (MYP) for Years 7-11, and Diploma Programme (DP) for Years 12-13. Under the Private Independent School Scheme, 70% of the students of Discovery College must be Hong Kong permanent residents.  History  Discovery College being constructed next to Club Siena in Yi Pak Bay, Discovery Bay Plans to set up Discovery College as one of ESF's first private schools began in 1999. As a private ESF school, Discovery College would not receive recurrent government subsidy. In 2001, the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB) granted ESF a lot of land in Ma On Shan and in Discovery Bay to build two primary-cum-secondary schools under the Private Independent School Scheme. The Discovery Bay site would eventually become the permanent campus of Discovery College. Designed by Integrated Design Associates, the permanent campus was built between 2003 and 2008. The 70,000 sq ft campus cost HK$290 million, of which HK$137 million was granted by the Hong Kong Government. Operated by ESF Educational Services Limited (ESL), an ESF subsidiary, Discovery College needs to repay ESF its capital costs of HK$168 million within 20 years of opening. In 2007, the primary section of Discovery College opened in a temporary site in Lai King, merging with former ESF primary school Bauhinia School. About two thirds of the school's students were transferred from Bauhinia School. The 450 students moved into the Discovery Bay campus when it began operation on 20 August 2008.

Mair's music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as the co-founder and bass guitarist for the English rock band the Only Ones, co-producing their second studio album Even Serpents Shine and writing and singing \\"My Way Out of Here\\" for their third and final album Baby's Got a Gun. They released a top 60 hit in 1992 with the single \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\". The band has maintained a cult following throughout its existence. Mair began his solo career in 2014, while still a member of the Only Ones. Career Mair grew up in the Glasgow area. He began playing guitar at about age 13 and gained experience in various bands during the 1960s. In 1962, Mair and Eddie Campbell formed the Glasgow band The Beatstalkers. The line-up included Davie Lennox on vocals, Eddie Campbell on guitar, Mair on bass and 'Tudge' Williamson on drums (replaced by Jeff Allen). Later Ronnie Smith joined the group on rhythm guitar. Under the management of Joe Gaffney, the band went on to become Scotland's \\"top group\\" at the time. They were called the \\"Scottish Beatles\\" by the local press because of the screaming and riots that occurred anywhere they made an appearance; although the band toured England and Europe many times, had a 6-week sell-out residency at the famous Marquee Club and performed on the TV show \\"Ready Steady Go!\\", they never achieved the same dizzy heights of success as they did in Scotland. The band signed a recording contract with Decca Records. Their records sold thousands of copies in Scotland, but with only two chart shops in Scotland their sales made no impact on the UK charts. They split in 1969 after their van was stolen with all their equipment in it. After The Beatstalkers decided to call it a day in 1969 Mair began making leather clothes and hand made boots for rock bands the likes of Yes, Santana, The Tremolos, David Bowie, Uriah Heep and many more. A short time later in 1970 he opened shops in Kensington Market, Kings Road and High street Kensington selling handmade leather stacked heel boots which he was making in his own factory in Kentish Town. In 1971 he employed Freddie Mercury of the rock band Queen at his Kensington Market shop as his shop manager from 1971 until 1974. On one occasion after being at a party Freddie told Alan that everyone at the party, including the girls, had his boots on, and said ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know if you realise but you‚Äôre not considered hip unless you have on a pair of Alan Mair boots‚Äù After a five-year spell in the fashion world Mair was drawn back to the music business. He joined the \\"Al Matthews Band\\" who had a couple of hit records. They were a bunch of formidable players, all great musicians,.!!!! Al Matthews on vocals, who went on to play \\"Sergeant Apone\\" in Aliens. Raphael Ravenscroft on sax [Baker Street]. Sean Byrne on guitar. Theodore Thunder on drums [Leo Sayer]. Ric Parnell [2nd drummer] Atomic Rooster and played Mick Shrimpton in the movie ‚ÄúThis is Spinal Tap‚Äù. Dave Rose on keyboards [Leo Sayer and Allan Price] and Lindsay Scott on violin [JSD band]. They toured constantly. Their first tour was supporting Levi Stubbs‚Äôs ‚ÄúFour Tops‚Äù. When The Al Matthews band split Mair answered an advert in Melody Maker and went for an audition with Roger Chapman‚Äôs band ‚ÄúStreetwalkers‚Äù at Mano‚Äôs Studios in Lots Road. During a break he wandered into the studio next door and found himself watching The Only Ones rehearse. On leaving the studio Mike Kellie enquired who Alan was and found out he was a bass player. Without hearing him play Kellie said he felt a spiritual connection and that he was the bass player they were looking for. He joined The Only Ones in August 1976. They signed to CBS and recorded 3 studio albums, of which their first album ‚ÄúThe Only Ones and ‚ÄúEven Serpents Shine‚Äù received critical acclaim. The Only Ones included lead vocalist Peter Perrett, guitarist John Perry and drummer and ex-Spooky Tooth member Mike Kellie. Their first single, \\"Lovers of Today\\", was self-released on the Vengeance record label, and a year later they signed to CBS. Their next single \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\" became the band's best-known song. The band released The Only Ones in 1978, which was well received. The next year they released Even Serpents Shine, and a year later, they released their final studio album, Baby's Got a Gun. In the summer of 1980, they supported the Who on their tour of the United States. In 1982, the band officially disbanded. In subsequent years, The Only Ones gained a cult following, and compilation albums now outnumber their official studio albums. Later career In 2002 Alan Mair was asked by Alec Downie if he wanted to record a Frankie Miller song for an album that was a tribute to Miller‚Äôs song writing and also a fundraiser for the Glaswegian musician who was recovering from a brain haemorrhage. After the release of the album a concert was to follow at the Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow in September 2002, which Alan performed at. He said, ‚ÄúIt was an amazing night full of Scottish talent and it was a blast to be performing at the Barrowland again‚Äù. Mair currently lives in London and has played in both of his band reunions. On 23 December 2005, he played in a Beatstalkers reunion in Glasgow. In 2007, Mair was the driving force in reforming the Only Ones, who performed to a sell-out show at Shepherds Bush Empire. This was followed by shows at the O2 Wireless Festival in London's Hyde Park and Harewood House in Yorkshire with the White Stripes, and the first ever Connect Festival at Inveraray Castle in Scotland where they shared bills with Primal Scream, Big Star, and Johnny Marr. In 2009, they extended their touring to take in the Netherlands, Japan, Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, and in 2012, they played at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool and headlined the Opera House stage in The Winter Gardens on Saturday 4 August. Mair remastered all three CBS studio albums for the band, which were re-released with bonus tracks in February 2009. In 2014, Mair started to record tracks for a solo album Field of One planned for release on his own label IKA Records. His debut single \\"Four Winds\\", taken from the album was released in December 2014, and his second single \\"Stairway to Hell\\" was released in August 2015.

The songs are a nostalgic pastiche of 1960s music, and the story tells a tale of teenage dreams and young love \\"set around 1964 in a nightclub called the Club-a-Go-Go\\".  The Heather Brothers  The Heather Brothers were born in London and grew up in Zimbabwe, where they started the rock group The Chequers, touring Zimbabwe and South Africa. When they returned to England they were signed, along with Tammy Jones, by Mrs Wallich of Delyse Records to form a folk group, The Three People, and released a number of singles through EMI. After touring Germany they split up and the brothers formed the progressive rock band The Quiet World, recruiting arranger Philip Henderson and guitarist Steve Hackett (who went on to join Genesis). After releasing a number of singles for PYE and The Road album on PYE's progressive label, Dawn, they broke up the band and moved into contemporary music. Along with Henderson they formed a new orchestra using final year students from the Royal College and Royal Academy of Music, recording the orchestral album, Etheral Conception and the choral works 'Rebirth' and 'Seascape' for Starday King. They were then signed by Elvis Presley's publisher, Freddy Bienstock as contract songwriters to his publishing house Carlin Music. Soon after the brothers began writing musicals. A Slice of Saturday Night is their most successful musical and was followed by Lust, which played at the Haymarket Theatre. Other musicals include Big Sin City, The Comeback, Love Bites, Sin $ Salvation and Camp Horror, the thrillers Blood Money and Seriously Twisted and the comedy Oz And The Pom. 'Bobby Dallas After Party' they co-wrote with Mark Nassar and Brooke Lundy. The Heather Brothers have also written and directed two films, The Big Finish and Seriously Twisted. Productions A Slice of Saturday Night was first produced in April 1989 by the Brighton Actors Theatre at the Nightingale pub in Brighton with Simon Lovat, Billy Lomas, Roy Smiles, Grania Smith, Sarah Clarke, Jannette Eddisford, Mitch Johnston and Binky Baker. It was performed at the King's Head Theatre, Islington in August 1989 and then made its West End d√©but at London's Arts Theatre on September 27, 1989. The musical was directed by Marc Urquhart and starred Binky Baker as Eric, David Easter as Gary and Terry, Lisa Hollander as Bridget, Mitch Munroe as Sharon, Georgia Mitchell as Sue, James Powell as Rick, Roy Smiles as Eddie and Debi Thomson as Penny and Shirl. Following national and foreign tours, the musical returned to the West End at the Strand Theatre in the autumn of 1993 for a twelve-week run, starring pop star Sonia as Sue and Dennis Waterman as Eric. The musical has enjoyed more than 300 productions worldwide since then, including an off- Broadway production under the name Caf√© a Go Go and has been translated into nine languages. A new shortened version of A Slice Of Saturday Night has been chosen by Cunard as their signature show on the Queen Elizabeth cruise ship.\\"Queen Elizabeth Press Kit: Luxury Cruise Ship : Cunard Cruise Line - Cunard\\" , 13 July 2010. Retrieved on 12 Oct 2010. With a cast of 29 it will be the largest production Cunard has ever staged. A London Revival was staged at Upstairs at the Gatehouse between 16 December 2010 and 30 January 2011 and produced by in-house company Ovation. This has become a popular show to be performed in schools and colleges - often as part of a BTEC programme. When performed in schools, some songs are omitted due to the lyrical content, which may be felt somewhat unsuitable for under 16s to perform. Synopsis Seven teenagers dance and eye each other and flirt on a Saturday night at popular Club A Go Go in a town in the British provinces. Sue is going out with Gary, but he flirts with Penny and the other girls at every opportunity. Sharon and Rick like each other but are too shy to tell each other.

Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah, better known by the pen name Hamka (17 February 1908 ‚Äì 24 July 1981) was an Indonesian  øƒÅlim, philosopher, writer, lecturer, politician and journalist.Jeffrey Hadler, \\"Home, Fatherhood, Succession: Three Generations of Amrullahs in Twentieth-Century Indonesia\\". First affiliated with the Masyumi Party until it was disbanded, he served as the inaugural chief cleric of the Indonesian Council of Ulemas, and was active in Muhammadiyah until he died. Al-Azhar University and Malaysian National University both granted him honorary doctorates, while Moestopo University of Jakarta appointed him a Distinguished Professor. Hamka is further honoured by being the namesake of Hamka Muhammadiyah University, and is an Indonesian National Hero.  Early life  Maninjau, was renovated in 2001 and named Buya Hamka Birthplace Museum. The museum now holds most of his books, publications, and related goods. Hamka was born on 17 February 1908 in Agam, West Sumatra, the eldest child of seven. Raised in a family of devout Muslims, his father was Abdul Karim Amrullah, a clerical reformer of Islam in Minangkabau, also known as Haji Rasul. His mother, Sitti Shafiyah, came from a lineage of Minangkabau artists. His paternal grandfather, Muhammad Amrullah, was a member of the Naqshbandiyah. Prior to his formal education, Hamka lived with his grandmother in a house south of Maninjau. When he was six years old, he moved with his father to Padang Panjang. Following common tradition in Minang, he studied the Quran, and slept in a mosque near his family home (Minang boys were not traditionally assigned a bedroom in the family home). As well, he studied the silek. He listened to kaba (stories which were sung along with traditional Minangkabau music), inspiring him to the craft of storytelling. Later in life, Hamka would draw from Minang culture in his novels. = Education = In 1915, Hamka enrolled at the SMKA Sultan Muhammad, where he studied the general sciences. Two years later, he would take on an additional academic load, starting at the Diniyah School. In 1918, Hamka's father enrolled him at the Sumatera Thawalib. Hamka would cease to attend SMKA Sultan Muhammad. Hamka was dissatisfied with this state of affairs, and often studied on his own. He would frequent a library ran by one of his teachers, Afiq Aimon Zainuddin. In an attempt to prove he could make it on his own, and influenced by the books he'd read about Central Java, Hamka set his sights on moving to Java. At the same time, he no longer held any interest in completing his education at the Thawalib. After four years of study, he left without a diploma. In 1922, Hamka moved to Parabek, to study under Aiman Ibrahim Wong. This did not last long, as he left for Java soon afterwards. = Moving to Java = Hamka travelled all over Minangkabau as a teenager, gaining the nickname Si Bujang Jauh (the Boy from Afar) from his father. Hamka's parents divorced when he was 15, which affected him profoundly. Hamka decided to leave for Java when he learnt that the Islam taught there was far more advanced in terms of structure and organisation. In Bengkulu, however, he contracted smallpox; he thus decided to return to Padang Panjang after a two-month spell of being bedridden. Even so, his desire to move to Java never ceased; he finally departed in 1924, a year after recovering from the disease. Once on Java, Hamka went to Jogjakarta and began living with Amrullah Ja'far (his paternal uncle). Through Ja'far, Hamka began to participate in the activities of the Muhammadiyah and Sarekat Islam. In addition to studying under the two organisations, Hamka also further developed his views in regards to the hindrance of Islam's progress by Christianisation and communism. He also studied under many experts such as Bagoes Hadikoesoemo, HOS Tjokroaminoto, Abdul Rozak Fachruddin, and Suryopranoto. Before returning to Minangkabau, he visited Bandung and met with Masjumi leaders such as Ahmad Hassan and Mohammad Natsir, which gave him the opportunity to write in the magazine Pembela Islam (\\"Defenders of Islam\\"). Subsequently, in 1925, he went to Pekalongan, West Java to meet Sutan Mansur Ahmad Rashid, who was the chairman of the Muhammadiyah's Pekalongan branch at the time, and learnt more about Islam from him. While in Pekalongan, he stayed at his brother's house and started giving religious talks in some places. In his first wandering in Java, he claimed to have a new spirit in studying Islam. He also saw no difference between Islamic reformation missions in both the Minangkabau and Javan regions: the reformation in Minangkabau aimed at purifying Islam off regressive practices of imitation and superstition, while the Javan movement was more focused to the efforts of combating backwardness, ignorance and poverty. = Performing the Hajj = Atmosphere implementation Hajj in Mosque, Mecca. Hamka's trip to Mecca in 1927 inspired him to write Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah. After a year in Java, Hamka went back to Padang Panjang in July 1925 where he wrote his first magazine titled Chatibul Ummah, which contained a collection of speeches that he listened on Iron Bridge Mosque (Surau Jembatan Besi), and Tabligh Muhammadiyah. Between the business of his activity in the field of Dawah through writing, he made speeches in several places in Padang Panjang. But at that moment, everything is precisely sharply criticised by his father, \\"Speeches alone are useless, fill yourself with knowledge, then those speeches would be meaningful and useful.\\" On the other hand, he did not get a good reception from the public. He was often derided as an \\"uncertified Islam orator\\", even he had received criticism from some scholars because he did not master Arabic language well. Criticism he received in his native land motivated him to be more mature. In February 1927, he made the decision to go to Mecca to expand his religious knowledge, including learning the Arabic language and performing his first hajj pilgrimage. He left without saying goodbye to his father and went on his own dime. While in Mecca, he became correspondent of the daily \\"Andalas Light\\" (Pelita Andalas) and also worked at a printing company owned by Mr. Hamid, son of Majid Kurdish, Ahmad Al-Khatib Minangkabawi's father-in-law. His mastery of the foreign language he learned enabled him to read classic Islamic kitab, books, and Islam newsletters. Towards the pilgrimage, Hamka and several other pilgrims candidate founded the East Indian Association (Persatuan Hindia Timur), an organisation giving lessons to Dutch Indies pilgrims-to-be. He lived where?? for some time after the pilgrimage, where he met Agus Salim and had expressed his desire to settle in Mecca, but Agus Salim instead advised him to go home reasoning: \\"You can do a lot more work with your study and movements that you are fighting for. Therefore, it would be better to develop yourself in your own homeland\\", Agus Salim said. Hamka soon returned to his homeland after seven months of living in Mecca. However, instead of going home to Padang Panjang, Hamka settled in the city of Medan, where his returning ship had anchored. = Career in Medan = While in Medan, he wrote many articles for various magazines and had become a religion teacher for several months in Tebing Tinggi. He sent his writings to the newspaper Pembela Islam in Bandung and Voice of Muhammadiyah, which was led by Abdul Rozak Fachruddin, in Yogyakarta. In addition, he also worked as a correspondent for the daily paper Pelita Andalas and wrote trip reports, especially about his journey to Mecca in 1927. In 1928, he wrote the first story in Minangkabau titled Sabariyah. In the same year, he was appointed as editor of the \\"Era Progress\\" (Kemajuan Zaman) magazine, which was based on the results of the Muhammadiyah conference in Padang Panjang. The next year, he wrote several books, among others : Agama dan Religion and Women, Islamic Defenders, Minangkabau Tradition, Islam Defender, Kepentingan Dawah, and Mi'raj Verses. However, some of his writings were confiscated because they were considered as seditious by the colonial government in power that time. earthquake measuring 7.6 SR destroyed most of Padang Panjang, including houses in Gatangan Hamka's father, Markets Obsolete When in the field, the people in the village had repeatedly asked him to send some letters home, yet he declined. This worried his father, who asked Sutan Mansur Ahmad Rashid to pick him up and persuade him to go home. Sutan's plea finally convinced Malik to return to his hometown in Maninjau, which at the time was in ruins due to the 1926 earthquake, including his father's home in Padang Panjang Lantah. Arriving at his hometown, he finally met his father and was overcome with emotions. His father was shocked to learn that he journeyed to Hajj on his own and paid with his own money, saying \\"Why don't you let me know about this noble and sacred mean? I was poor and on hard times at the time\\" His realization for his father's honest concern of him changed his view of his father. After about a year settling in Sungai Batang, Abdul Malik left his hometown again to go to Medan in 1936. During his time in Medan, he worked as an editor and became editor-in-chief of a magazine Pedoman Masyarakat, which he founded with an Islamic cleric M. Yunan Nasution. Through Pedoman Masyarakat, he used the penname \\"Hamka\\" for the first time. While in Medan, he wrote Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah, which was inspired by his trip to Mecca in 1927. After the novel was published in 1938, he wrote Sinking of the van der Wijck, which was written as a serialised story in Pedoman Masyarakat. In addition, he also published several novels and books such as: Merantau ke Deli (\\"Going Away to Deli\\"), Kedudukan Perempuan dalam Islam (\\"Women's Position in Islam\\"), Tuan Direktur (\\"The Director\\"), New Forces, Driven, In The Valley of Life, Father, Modern Mysticism, and Falsafah Hidup (\\"Life Philosophy\\"). The parent magazine for Pedoman was shut down in 1943 during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. During the Japanese occupation, Hamka was appointed as a religious adviser to the Japanese. He was also a member of a makeshift assembly that handled government and Islamic matters in 1944. He accepted this position, believing the Japanese's promise to grant independence to Indonesia. But after occupying this position, he was regarded as an accomplice to the invaders by his friends. He was subjected to endless criticism as the Japanese were defeated and surrendered to the Allies, which drove him back to the Minangkabau after the Revolution broke out in 1945, in the meantime also fighting to repel the invaders by joining Indonesian guerrillas to fight against the return of the Dutch in the jungles in Medan.  Career and later life  After his marriage to Siti Rahim, Hamka Muhammadiyah branch was active was the management of Minangkabau, whose origin stemmed from the association Joints bakalnya Safe founded by his father in 1925 in Batang River. In addition, he became the head of Tablighi School, a religious school founded Muhammadiyah on 1 January 1930. Since attending the congress of Muhammadiyah in Solo in 1928, Hamka never missed attending congresses next Muhammadiyah. Upon his return from Solo, he began to assume various positions, until finally he was appointed as Chairman of Muhammadiyah branch of Padang Panjang. After the 19th Muhammadiyah Congress in Bukittinggi in 1930, followed by the next congress in Yogyakarta, he meets an invitation to set up a branch of Muhammadiyah in Bengkalis. Subsequently, in 1932, he was sent by Muhammadiyah to Makassar to prepare and move the spirit of the people to welcome the Muhammadiyah Congress to-21 in Makassar. While in Makassar, he had published Al-Mahdi, a monthly Islamic science magazine. In 1934, a year after attending a congress of Muhammadiyah in Semarang, he was made a permanent member of the Council of Muhammadiyah Council for the region Central Sumatra. Muhammadiyah increasingly uphill career when he moved to Medan. In 1942, along with the fall of the Dutch East Indies to the Japanese colonial power, Hamka was elected as leader of East Sumatra Muhammadiyah to replace H. Mohammad Said. But in December 1945, he decided to return to the Minangkabau and the release position. The following year, he was elected Chairman of the Assembly of West Sumatra Muhammadiyah leaders replace SY Sutan Mangkuto. This position he embraces until 1949. In 1953, he was elected as the leader of the center Muhammadyiah Muhammadiyah Congress to-32 at Purwokerto. Since then, he has always chosen the Muhammadiyah Congress further, until in 1971 he pleaded not elected because he was senile. However, he was still appointed as an adviser to the central leadership of Muhammadiyah until the end. In 1973, he testified in support of Vivian Rubiyanti Iskandar's petition before the West Jakarta District Court for legal recognition of her gender, saying that \\"[her desire to transition] does not run contrary to Allah's law, but in keeping with the teachings of Islam, which holds good will to all in high esteem\\".  Death  Hamka died on the 24th July 1981, and his remains were interred at Tanah Kusir Public Cemetery.

History=Founding= The school was founded by Lionel Helbert (1870‚Äì1919), with help from his sister Adeline Rose, wife to Vice Admiral Sir James Goodrich, KCVO (1851‚Äì1925). Helbert an exhibitioner of both Winchester and Oriel College, Oxford, was for over four years a House of Commons clerk. The Helberts were supported by Hampshire's Lord Northbrook (who had also helped found the predecessor school), and by their kinsman Lord Rothschild. Helbert, who described himself as Principal, was influenced by the Miss Mason system, as seen at her House of Education, Ambleside (akin to the PNEU), and things like the Montessori method, the ideas of Edmond Holmes, and the Little Commonwealth for young delinquents developed by Homer Lane on the lines of the George Junior Republic in America, basically as put by Norman Mac Munn, who taught at West Downs 1914‚Äì18, they were interested in the: emancipation of the child. =Architecture= Its buildings had been purpose-built for Winchester Modern School to designs by the architect Thomas Stopher on a good site on the south-western edge of the cathedral city of Winchester, nearly opposite (the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, architect William Butterfield) west of a Victorian county gaol, HMP Winchester (category B), and next to Edwin Hillier's nursery, established there in 1874. =Administration= On Helbert's death there was an hiatus under Dorset landowner William Brymer,He was a kinsman of William Ernest Brymer of Puddletown. A memorial tablet to Brymer at Puddletown reads: Wilfred John Brymer of Ilsington, High Sheriff of Dorset 1932, Justice of the Peace : Alderman of the Dorset County Council: For Many Years at West Downs School Winchester : Born 31 July 1883: Died 28 March 1957: Son of F. A. Brymer : Sometime Archdeacon of Wells. and Lady Goodrich then passed the school to Kenneth Tindall, a Sherborne housemaster. During the Second World War the school was evacuated first to Glenapp Castle and then more significantly to Blair Castle. At the end of the war it returned to Winchester. In 1953 the school was bought by Jerry Cornes, who was headmaster until 1988. =Move to co-education= For most of its history West Downs was a boarding school for boys aged between eight and thirteen, but in 1970 it admitted its first girl, and from 1975 to 1988 it was co-educational (though curiously the school's founding intake in 1897 of four comprised two girls). [correction: by Geoffrey Bass, grandson of Kenneth Tindall:- KBT's granddaughter Diana Bass also attended the school in 1949 when it was still an all male establishment].Geoffrey Bass ‚Äì family member of KBT =Closing and repurposing= West Downs was a rigorous and enlightened place which prepared its pupils admirably for a variety of schools (including Winchester and Eton) and also for life in general. It lasted ninety-one years and about three headmasters, closing in 1988 (Read more). The school's site has lived on as The West Downs Conference and Performing Arts Centre, which was opened by Lord Puttnam in May 2001, and then from 2005 as part of the University of Winchester; and from 2009 as the university's own Winchester Business School.

Meanwhile, Helbert's mother was Sarah Magdalene 'Lena' (1837‚Äì1874) daughter of Richard Lane (1794‚Äì1870) (Plymouth Brother and descendant of Jane Lane) by Sarah Pink Tracey (of Liskeard).

It is a member of the European Cricket Council and an associate member of the International Cricket Council since 2017. It organises the Cyprus cricket league which has 12 participating teams including some from the British military bases of Akrotiri, Episkopi, and Dekhelia. It is also responsible for the Cyprus National Cricket team. Cricket has been played in Cyprus for many years, but has mainly been confined to the British Army bases. The European Cricket Council, given the task of promoting cricket throughout Europe, encouraged Cyprus Cricket to form its own organisation, the Cyprus Cricket Association, with its own committee and constitution. From 2003 the CCA have been organising cricket on the island, extending the game into the towns, setting up a league, starting youth cricket in the schools, and forming a national team to enter European competitions. The European Cricket Council provides the CCA with funds to promote youth cricket and train coaches to go out into the schools. The British Army has been helpful to the CCA, giving them access to its facilities, and entering teams into the newly formed league. In fact the 2005 league champions were a military side, WSBA.

Life = Germany = The young Margarete Dessoff Margarete (sometimes incorrectly spelled Margarethe) Dessoff was born in Vienna and came to Frankfurt am Main when she was six years old, her father (Felix Otto Dessoff) having been appointed conductor of the Frankfurt Opera House. Dessoff studied voice with Gustav Gunz und Marie Schr√∂der-Hanfst√§ngl (1892‚Äì97) at Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium in Frankfurt and from 1912 directed the women's chorus there. Dessoff's singing career was cut short when a famous opera singer (probably Hanfst√§ngl) teaching at Dr. Hoch's apparently ruined her voice. She regained it through private lessons (with Jenny Hahn, a pupil of Julius Stockhausen), but had she not lost her voice she might never have become a well-known and well-loved choral director. In addition to the Dessoff'scher Frauenchor (first concert in 1907 at Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium), which quickly became famous throughout Germany, she also directed the Frankfurter Bachgemeinde for several years and in 1918 founded one of the first madrigal ensembles in Germany. = New York = During the time that Margarete Dessoff lived in Frankfurt, the Dessoff family home was across the street from the aunt and uncle of the American banker Felix Warburg. As a boy, Mr. Warburg came to know Margarete Dessoff from visits to his uncle's house, and it was this friendship which moved him to bring her to America for a holiday following the strain of the First World War. The Institute of Musical Art (later Juilliard School of Music) in New York City had been founded in 1905 with the European conservatories as its model. Earlier, many young musicians had felt the need to study in Europe: American Edward MacDowell and Australian Percy Grainger both studied at the Konservatorium in Frankfurt. Having Clara Schumann on the faculty had made Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium very well known internationally: in 1890 there were 23 Americans and 46 from England studying there. Several teachers from Dr. Hoch's Konservatorium taught later at Juilliard. At the height of inflation in the 1920s Margarete Dessoff answered an invitation to become chorus director there, where she also established the Madrigal Chorus. She founded various other choirs in the 1920s: in 1924 with Angela Diller, she formed the Adesdi Chorus of Women's Voices, with the name Adesdi being formed from parts of each of the founders' name; then in 1929 she founded a mixed voice choir, The New York A Cappella Singers, and in 1930 these two became \\"The Dessoff Choirs\\" which meant that both choirs gave their concerts together with programs that contained pieces for women's voices (sung by Adesdi) and for mixed voices (sung by the New York A Cappella Singers). She also founded the Vecchi Singers with whom she conducted the first American performance of Orazio Vecchi's L'Amfiparnaso in 1933. Margarete Dessoff was committed to the performance of rarely heard early music as well as unknown works of young composers. Her artistically planned programs encouraged contemporary composers such as Hans G√°l, Erwin Lendvai, Hugo Herrmann, Marion Bauer, Lazare Saminsky and others to write new music for choirs. =Retirement= Her newly founded choirs in New York flourished until her early retirement, due to an accident, in 1936. As a return to Nazi Germany was impossible for her, she retired to Locarno, Switzerland, where she died in 1944. Her name still lives on in New York where the Dessoff Choirs which she founded, still flourishes.

Her paternal grandparents were Alberic III, Count of Dammartin, and Mahaut de Clermont, daughter of Renaud de Clermont, Count of Clermont-en- Beauvaisis, and Cl√©mence de Bar. Her maternal grandparents were William IV of Ponthieu and Alys, Countess of the Vexin, daughter of Louis VII of France and Constance of Castile.  Marriage negotiations  After secret negotiations were undertaken in 1234, it was agreed that Joan would marry King Henry III of England. This marriage would have been politically unacceptable to the French, however, since Joan stood to inherit not only her mother's county of Ponthieu, but also the county of Aumale that was vested in her father's family. Ponthieu bordered on the duchy of Normandy, and Aumale lay within Normandy itself. The French king Philip Augustus had seized Normandy from King John of England as recently as 1205, and Philip's heirs could not risk the English monarchy recovering any land in that area, since it might allow the Plantagenets to re- establish control in Normandy. As it happened, Joan's father Simon had become involved in a conspiracy of northern French noblemen against Philip Augustus and to win pardon from Philip's son King Louis VIII, Simon‚Äîwho had only daughters‚Äîwas compelled to promise that he would marry off neither of his two eldest daughters without the permission of the king of France. In 1235, Queen Blanche invoked that promise on behalf of her minor son, King Louis IX, and threatened to deprive Simon of all his lands if Joan married Henry III. Blanche also petitioned the pope to forbid the marriage on the account of consanguinity. He agreed, denying the dispensation which Henry had sought and paid for. Henry therefore abandoned the project for his marriage to Joan and in January 1236 married instead Louis IX's sister-in-law Eleanor of Provence.  Queen of Castile  Coat of arms of Joan as Queen of Castile In November 1235, Blanche of Castile's nephew, King Ferdinand III of Castile, lost his wife, Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen, and Blanche's sister Berengaria of Castile, Ferdinand's mother, was concerned that her widowed son might involve himself in liaisons that were unsuited to his dignity as king. Berengaria determined to find Ferdinand another wife, and her sister Blanche suggested Joan of Dammartin, whose marriage to the king of Castile would keep her inheritance from falling into hostile hands. In October 1237, at the age of about seventeen, Joan and Ferdinand were married in Burgos. Since Ferdinand already had seven sons from his first marriage to Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen, there was little chance of Ponthieu being absorbed by Castile. They had four sons and one daughter: # Ferdinand II, Count of Aumale (1239‚Äìca 1265), who married Laure de Montfort, Lady of Espernon, sometime after 1256 and had issue. # Eleanor (1241-1290), Countess of Ponthieu, who married king Edward I of England and had issue. # Louis (1243‚Äìca 1275), who married Juana de Manzanedo, Lady of Gaton, and had issue. # Simon (1244), died young and buried in a monastery in Toledo. # John (1246), died young and buried at the cathedral in C√≥rdoba. She accompanied Ferdinand to Andalucia and lived with him in the army camp as he besieged Seville in 1248. Upon her mother's death in 1251, Joan succeeded as Countess of Ponthieu and Montreuil, which she held in her own right. After Ferdinand III died in 1252, Joan did not enjoy a cordial relationship with his heir, her stepson Alfonso X of Castile, with whom she quarreled over the lands and income she should have received as dowager queen of Castile. Sometime in 1253, she became the ally and supporter of another of her stepsons, Henry of Castile, who also felt Alfonso had not allowed him all the wealth their father had meant him to have. Joan unwisely attended secret meetings with Henry and his supporters, and it was rumored that she and Henry were lovers. This further strained her relations with Alfonso and in 1254, shortly before her daughter Eleanor was to marry Edward of England, Joan and her eldest son Ferdinand left Castile and returned to her native Ponthieu. Rule in Ponthieu and Aumale Sometime between May 1260 and 9 February 1261, Joan took a second husband, Jean de Nesle, Seigneur de Falvy et de La H√©relle (died 2 February 1292). This marriage is sometimes said to have produced a daughter, B√©atrice, but she was in fact a child of Jean de Nesle's first marriage. In 1263, Joan was recognized as countess of Aumale after the death of a childless Dammartin cousin. But her son Ferdinand died around 1265, leaving a young son known as John of Ponthieu. During her marriage to Jean de Nesle, Joan ran up considerable debts and also appears to have allowed her rights as countess in Ponthieu to weaken. The death of her son Ferdinand in 1265 made her next son, Louis, her heir in Ponthieu but around 1275 he, too, died, leaving two children. But according to inheritance customs in Picardy, where Ponthieu lay, Joan's young grandson John of Ponthieu could not succeed her there; her heir in Ponthieu automatically became her adult daughter Eleanor, who was married to Edward I of England. It does not appear that Joan was displeased at the prospect of having Ponthieu pass under English domination; from 1274 to 1278, in fact, she had her granddaughter Joan of Acre (the daughter of Edward I and Eleanor) with her in Ponthieu, and appears to have treated the girl so indulgently that when she was returned to England her parents found that she was thoroughly spoiled. That same indulgent nature appears to have made Joan inattentive to her duties as countess. When she died at Abbeville, in March 1279, her daughter and son-in-law were thus confronted with Joan's vast debts, and to prevent the king of France from involving himself in the county's affairs, they had to pay the debts quickly by taking out loans from citizens in Ponthieu and from wealthy abbeys in France. They also had to deal with a lengthy legal struggle with Eleanor's nephew, John of Ponthieu, to whom Joan bequeathed a great deal of land in Ponthieu as well as important legal rights connected with those estates. The dispute was resolved when John of Ponthieu was recognized as Joan's successor in Aumale according to the inheritance customs that prevailed in Normandy, while Edward and Eleanor retained Ponthieu and John gave up all his claims there. By using English wealth, Edward and Eleanor restored stability to the administration and the finances of Ponthieu, and added considerably to the comital estate by purchasing large amounts of land there.

The station is managed by Transport for West Midlands, and is the terminus for over 85 bus routes (some services are station-bound only), operated by eight registered bus companies (these are National Express West Midlands, Thandi companies (t/a Thandi Buses, Midland Bus Company, Corporate Express & Finesse Coaches), Rotala (t/a Central Connect and Diamond West Midlands, Choice Travel which now all operate under Diamond Bus), Walsall Community Transport and Arriva Midlands). Architecture St Paul's Bus Station is dominated by an elliptical roof standing on twelve steel columns. The concrete roof covers an area of , beneath which are three bus islands, consisting of a total of eleven bus stands. A smaller aerofoil covers a further three stands. tall glass screens shelter pedestrians from bus fumes and provide information on bus routes. At each of the bus stands is hardwood bench set within a low concrete wall. The benches were designed to be vandal- proof. At its longest point, the canopy is in length and wide at its widest point. The roof is covered in ten circular holes with hoods to deflect the wind. There are seventeen similar rooflights in the canopy. The concourse area is two storeys tall and consists of large concrete walls, supporting the columns for the canopy roof. The bus station covers a total area of . Allford Hall Monaghan Morris designed the building for Centro. The structural engineers were Atelier One, Shepherd Construction Ltd were the contractors, Watkins Dally were the landscape architects and Clark Smith Partnership were the civil engineers. The project cost ¬£6.5 million. A small satellite section was added to the bus station in 2001. Despite the extensive profile, there have been calls for it to be demolished. Most notably, Walsall South MP Bruce George said that Centro should consider replacing the bus station due to the complexity of the layout. Bus drivers have complained that there were too many bends and that it quickly became overcrowded, which may have contributed to two incidents at the bus station, in one of which a local woman died. In December 2008, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive decided to merge Stands K & L in the main bus station. This resulted in an extra stand being added to the row housing the Travel & Tourist Information Shop, with one being removed in the middle row. No Stand Alterations were caused by this stand, as no extra stands were created, just rearranged. Two years later in December 2010, the station reverted to its old layout. In July 2011 the nearby Bradford Place station and the toilets in the main station underwent an extensive refurbishment. Both re-opened during early September 2011. Incidents/Events On 9 July 2007, a 66-year-old woman from the Bentley area of Walsall died, and several others were injured, when an Arriva Midlands service 360 to Aldridge went the wrong way up the bus stations one way system, crashing into several pedestrians and other vehicles (which should not have been in the bus station area) before finally being stopped by a National Express West Midlands 51 service double decker to Birmingham. The bus was deliberately driven into the Arriva bus by the female driver to stop its progress. The 62-year-old driver, named as John Connolly, from Burntwood, was charged with causing death by dangerous driving. In February 2009, after a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, lasting one week, Mr Connolly was cleared of the charge, an outcome that was welcomed by the police. On 20 February 2008, an Arriva Midlands service crashed into the back of a Thandi Bus on service 346 causing it to shunt forward. This caused two elderly women to be crushed by the bus, one underneath, the other against the glass pane of a shelter. Both were seriously injured. The Arriva driver was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving and was released on bail. In July 2008 the driver, Peter Love, appeared in court charged with driving without due care and attention, where he was banned from driving for six months. It was also revealed Arriva Midlands had sacked him. Both incidents caused the bus station to be shut for several hours, which caused travel disruption in the town centre. A minor incident occurred on 7 June 2010, this time between a National Express West Midlands bus and a Diamond Bus vehicle both on the 301 service to Mossley. Nobody was seriously injured, and no damage was caused to the station, yet the incident once again prompted calls for the station to be demolished or altered, before another serious incident happened. On 28 February 2011, a suspect package found outside the neighbouring job centre caused the bus station to be evacuated and closed from 1pm through until 7.30pm after the Bomb Disposal Squad had declared the package safe. This caused disruption to the bus station, and the wider town centre. Exactly one week later on 7 March 2011, a collision occurred on the approach to the station, involving two National Express West Midlands buses and two cars, neither of which should have been in the vicinity. Although officially on the highway and despite there being no injuries, this again prompted calls for better policing of the interchange or a change of layout.

In the mid-19th century, the Romantic movement waned and a new literary movement arose in Europe: Realism. This new approach grew out of the 1850 French reaction to selected aspects of Romanticism, mainly costumbrismo. As artistic style rebelled against \\"art for art's sake\\" and literary imagination grew tired of fanciful and colorful depictions, artists and authors began to focus more objectively on people, actions, and society. The main precursor was Honor√© de Balzac (1799‚Äì1850), who, with works like The Human Comedy, imposed a moral and social objective on the novel. This purpose, which became the almost exclusive concern of the writers of the time, soon led to Naturalism. The term realist was used for the first time in 1850, referring to painting, but was later adopted by literature, in which it was applied mainly to the novel. One of the reasons for the popular success of novels was their publication in newspapers in installments, conceived as a tactic to encourage the public to buy the newspaper daily. The attitude of the realistic writer is analytical and critical, and usually remains objective. The important novels of the 19th century focused on social character, leading the writers to consider themselves to be \\"historians of the present\\". Historical context During the 19th century, Spain experienced one of the most tumultuous periods of its history. The century opened with the War of Independence against France and ended with the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the \\"Disaster of '98\\"‚Äîthe loss of Cuba and Puerto Rico in America and the Philippines in Asia. The Borb√≥n (Bourbon) dynasty, after the reigns of Fernando VII (1814‚Äì1833) and Isabel II (1833‚Äì1868), was overthrown in the revolution of 1868, the Glorious Revolution. The rule of Serrano (1869‚Äì1870) and the brief reign of Amadeo de Saboya (1871‚Äì1873) followed. Later, the short era of the First Republic (1873‚Äì1874) began, followed by the Restoration of the Borb√≥n dynasty under Alfonso XII (1874‚Äì1885), son of Isabel II, after the uprising of Mart√≠nez Campos. After the death of Alfonso XII, his second wife, Mar√≠a Cristina assumed the regency until 1902, the year in which Alfonso's son Alfonso XIII began to reign. Naturalism Portrait of √âmile Zola (1868), by √âdouard Manet This literary movement began in France and its initiator was √âmile Zola (1840‚Äì1902). This style descends from the positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte (1798‚Äì1857), the methods of the physiologist Claude Bernard (1813‚Äì1878), and many distinctive achievements of the modern spirit: democracy, experimental methods (Claude Bernard), and theories of heredity (Charles Darwin). Zola, a socialist, looks for the cause of social problems in society, and of the individual's problems in biological heredity. Thus, Naturalism adopts a materialist and determinist concept of people as not morally responsible for their actions and the situations in which they are found, because these are determined by the environment and heredity. While the realist writer is conscious of what occurs, the naturalist investigates its cause and effect. Alcoholics, the insane, and psychopaths are prevalent in Zola's works, predicated on his belief that the environment was the source of many of society's ills. Zola introduced the naturalistic theory in The Experimental Novel (1880). In this essay on literary criticism, he maintains that the novelist is an observer and an experimenter. From the point of view of the observer, the writer offers the facts as he has seen them, and establishes the environment which the characters inhabit and where the facts are developed. From the point of view of the experimenter, the novelist \\"institutes the experience,\\" moving the characters through a particular story to show that the succession of events will occur in conformity with the demands of determinism. In Spain, the contradictions between naturalistic theories and religious beliefs reduced Naturalism's manifestation. Some critics even wondered whether Naturalism in the strictest sense ever occurred in Spain. Emilia Pardo Baz√°n, commonly considered to be naturalist, addresses Naturalism's reception in Spain in her 1883 article La cuesti√≥n palpitante (The Burning Question). Additionally, passages of texts by authors such as Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s have been considered naturalistic, but that has been explicitly rejected by the majority of literary critics. The line between Spanish Naturalism and Realism is difficult to distinguish due to the infrequent adoption of explicit theories among Spanish artists. Characteristics of Realism The Third-Class Wagon (1864), by realist painter Honor√© Daumier In Spain, the best literary fruit of the second half of the 19th century was the novel, a consequence of the international blossoming of the genre as an expression of the middle class's rising political power, obtained through successive revolutions (1789, 1820, 1830, 1848). The values and inquietudes of the middle-class are reflected in the mirror of Realist literature: individualism, materialism, desire for social ascent, and esteem of daily and immutable things. The fundamental themes of literary Realism are the contrast between traditional farming values and modern urban values, the exodus from the field to the city and inherent social and moral contrasts, the fight for social ascent and moral and economic success, women's dissatisfaction with restrictions against their working outside of the home, and middle-class independence and individualism. The themes of adultery and folletinesque and sentimental fantasy appear, as ways to escape the relentless Realism of the era. There are two main tendencies in Realism: the progressive and the conservative. The Realist novel of this period is characterized by: * Objective vision of reality through direct observation of customs or psychological characters, eliminating subjective aspects and fantastic events. According to Gald√≥s and Clar√≠n respectively, \\"The novel is the image of life,\\" as well as \\"an artistic copy of reality.\\" * Defense of a thesis: the narrators write their works focusing reality through their moral conception, using an omniscient narrator. The defense of a thesis usually compromises the objectivity of the novel. * Themes relevant to the reader, such as marital conflicts, infidelity, and defense of ideals. * Colloquial and popular language, which acquire great importance because they locate characters firmly in the environment reflected in the text. Realism and Naturalism in Spain In Spain, Realism installed itself with extreme facility, since a precedent in picaresque novels already existed. Furthermore, relevant themes were extant in that cornerstone of Spanish and world literature, Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote. Realism reached its maximum splendor in the second half of the 19th century with authors such as Juan Valera, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda, and Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, although it never established a canon as rigorous as that produced by the school of Balzac. * In the work of Gald√≥s, and later in that of Clar√≠n, Pardo Baz√°n, and Blasco Ib√°√±ez, clear naturalistic influences exist, but without the scientific and experimental foundations that √âmile Zola sought to imprint in his Realist works. They do share a spirit of subversiveness and struggle in the face of conservative ideology. * The Realist novel generally reflects regional settings. For example, Pereda's novels take place in Cantabria, Juan Valera's in Andalusia, and Clar√≠ns in Asturias. Benito Perez Gald√≥s's tendency to set his stories in Madrid, an urban environment, is a notable exception. Naturalism in Spain, as it did in France, also had its detractors, sometimes provoking great controversies. Naturalist Pedro Antonio de Alarc√≥n carried on a fierce rivalry with Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda who, impassioned, once described Realism as immoral. The movement's most exalted and ardent defenders were Benito Perez Gald√≥s and Emilia Pardo Baz√°n, who provoked one of the most furious conflicts with her 1883 publication of La cuesti√≥n palpitante (\\"The Throbbing Question\\"). The novel: main authors=Juan Valera= Juan Valera Juan Valera y Alcal√°- Galiano (Cabra, C√≥rdoba, October 1824 ‚Äì Madrid, April 1905) belonged to an aristocratic family. He carried out diplomatic missions in several countries and held important political positions. His career as a novelist began when he was around fifty years old. In his last years he was victim of progressive blindness. From his beginnings, Valera was opposed to Romanticism, because of its extremism, as much as he was to Realism, because they prevented him from totally realizing his vision. He only adopted a realist position when he chose real settings (like his native Andalusia) and lifelike characters, although he rejected the less attractive aspects of reality, which ran contrary to the credo of the naturalists and some realists. His importance is due to his novels; the first of them is Pepita Jim√©nez (1874), mostly written in epistolary form. In this work, the story of a widow is told. The widow agrees with a father that his son should be taken away from town to keep him away from her and to allow him to pursue his aspiration to the priesthood. Other important works are Do√±a Luz (which deals with questions of religious vocation) and Juanita la Larga. This third novel recounts the idyll of Don Paco, a fiftyish man, with the protagonist, who wishes to redeem herself through an honest marriage. Juan Valera was a liberal politician and a religious skeptic. He used a simple, although non-vulgar, literary language. When he died, the writers of the Generation of the 98 retained a deep respect for him. Today he is considered by many critics as the best Spanish prose writer of the 19th century, while recognizing the creative superiority of Gald√≥s. =Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda= Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda was born in Polanco (province of Santander, present-day Cantabria) in 1833. He belonged to a Hidalgo family, he traveled widely abroad, and he was a Carlist deputy, although later he dedicated himself to the cultivation of his lands and to literature. He maintained a friendship with Gald√≥s, despite their opposing political ideologies. He died in 1906 in his home town. He began his literary production as a costumbrista: inclined to realism with aspects of impressionism, he published Escenas monta√±osas (\\"Mountainous scenes\\"). Later, he would find his ideal formula for the novel, imbuing that costumbrism with a vision which conveyed his love for the landscape and the people of the mountains, with their passions and their characteristic language. In his first novels of this type (\\"idyllic novel\\"), he depicted the peacefulness and ignorance of rustic people confronting the political machinations of modern life (Don Gonzalo de la Gonzalera and De tal palo tal astilla). He defended a thesis that nowadays few would accept: like father, like son. The novel ends as Pereda decides to abandon the explicit defense of any argument. Stories like Sotileza (epic of Cantabrian fishermen) and La puchera belong to this second period. The one that is considered his masterpiece is Pe√±as arriba (1895), whose descriptive bucolic style and casticismo seem antiquated today. In spite of that, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda is considered a great narrator, possessed of great descriptive and epic capacity. =Pedro Antonio de Alarc√≥n= Pedro Antonio de Alarc√≥n Pedro Antonio de Alarc√≥n was born in Guadix (Granada) in 1833. He was one of the authors principally responsible for the domination of realism over romantic prose at that time. He was a politician as well as a writer, and his ideology evolved from liberal positions to more traditional ones. He participated in the Spanish‚ÄìMoroccan War as a volunteer and he left written testimony of his experience inDiario de un testigo de la Guerra de √Åfrica (Diary of a Witness to the African War). For a time he was a travel writer, relating several of his trips in his articles. His religious novels stood out among his other writings, the most popular of all being El esc√°ndalo (The Scandal), written in 1875; in this novel he defended the Jesuits, which was very controversial. His most popular work, and the one by which he is remembered, is El sombrero de tres picos, published in 1874, that would inspire Manuel de Falla to write his famous ballet of the same name. =Benito Perez Gald√≥s= Portrait of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s, by Joaqu√≠n Sorolla Gald√≥s is considered to be the most representative writer of the movement. He was born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 1843. He studied law in Madrid. He later lived in Paris, where he was intrigued by the novels of Honor√© de Balzac, a strong influence on his later work. He declared himself to be progressive and anticlerical, but this did not prevent him from forging close friendships with Men√©ndez y Pelayo and Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda, of opposite ideologies. Although he defined himself as a republican, little by little his radicalism tempered, and he maintained a personal friendship with Alfonso XIII. In 1910 he began to lose his eyesight, and the expenses of his numerous paramours brought him to near-ruin. The Spanish government sought the Nobel Prize for him, but was opposed by a significant portion of the Spanish populace, including the Real Academia and the leadership of the Catholic Church. He died, blind, in 1920. The National Episodes Among the prolific works of Gald√≥s are the Episodios Nacionales (National Episodes), a sprawling opus of 46 volumes in five distinct series. They depict a broad representation of contemporary Spanish history between the War of Independence and the Restoration, which serve as a backdrop for his stories. The first series, written between 1873 and 1875, includes the episodes of Trafalgar, Bail√©n, Zaragoza and Gerona. In almost all of them, the protagonist is Gabriel Araceli, a young man who lives during the climax of the War of Independence. Later series include volumes such as Equipaje del Rey Jos√© (The Luggage of King Jos√©); Los cien mil hijos de San Luis (The One Hundred Thousand Children of San Luis); Zumalac√°rregui, about the First Carlist War; and Prim (The One of the Sad Destinies), a book about Isabel II. The last series depicted events experienced by Gald√≥s himself, but the work was unfinished and it is seldom a topic of study or discussion. Novels In his first epoch (1867‚Äì1878), Gald√≥s vigorously wrote against intolerance and hypocrisy. His novels feature young male protagonists who confront the hostile atmosphere of provincial cities. Ironically, his writing at this time demonstrates the same narrow- mindedness that he condemns, from the opposite ideological perspective. (Do√±a Perfecta, Gloria, La Familia de Le√≥n Roch). Marianela, one of his more prominent novels of the first epoch, is the story of a tragic relationship between a blind man and an ignorant, ugly girl. The girl flees when her loved one recovers his sight, afraid to show her face to him; she dies, heartbroken, when he marries another woman. Later, between 1881 and 1915, he published 24 novels, which represent a \\"human comedy\\" of the daily life of Madrid. They maintained progressive, but less provocative, themes. These books focus on the Spanish middle class, portrayed with precision and a certain melancholy. Significant works of this group include La de Bringas (The Bringas Woman), about social climbing; Fortunata y Jacinta, his most important work; Miau, a dramatic vision of the bureaucracy of the time; Torquemada en la Hoguera (Torquemada in the Inferno), a study of greed and avarice; Misericordia (Compassion), with people of less-refined upbringing. Plays Late in life, P√©rez Gald√≥s began a career as a dramatic playwright. His most notable plays include La Loca de la Casa (The Crazy Woman of the House), Hija de San Quintin (The Daughter of San Quint√≠n), Electra (whose opening sparked a riot) and El Abuelo (The Grandfather), which was adapted into a 1998 film by Jos√© Luis Garci. Gald√≥s's theater works are characterized by sincerity and non- conformism; although contemporary at the time they were written, some of his theater works sound dated by current standards. Importance of Gald√≥s The impact of the National Episodes and many of his novels and plays was significant. Critics and writers of his time considered him to be a genius, although his outspoken views on religion, social policies and politics stimulated strong opposition from political and religious authority figures. The Generation of '98 were strongly influenced by his writing, although they rebelled against his \\"chabacaner√≠a\\" or perceived vulgarity; Ram√≥n del Valle- Incl√°n, for example, nicknamed him \\"Don Benito el garbancero\\" or the chick-pea man. However, it can be argued that the only vulgarity was found in the lives that he described. =Emilia Pardo Baz√°n= Emilia Pardo Baz√°n was born in A Coru√±a in 1851. Only child of the Count and Countess of Pardo Baz√°n, she got married at age seventeen and she settled in Madrid. She was a woman of great culture, she took many trips abroad, and an endowed chair in the Department of Literature at the University of Madrid was created for her. She died in Madrid in 1921. Work Among her studies on contemporary literature, La cuesti√≥n palpitante (The Burning Question) stands out, and although she does not accept naturalism in this work, she defends a realist point of view and confronts those who maintain that the only purpose of evil in literature is to defeat it. Her style was energetic and she profoundly explored difficult social problems. Her most important works were novels such as Un viaje de novios (A Honeymoon), which narrates the story of a marriage between a mature man and a young, uncultured, but wealthy woman; or The tribune, the most naturalist of her novels, where she describes the hard proletarian life in a tobacco factory. Of greatest importance to her reputation are Los pazos de Ulloa (The House of Ulloa) and its sequelLa madre naturaleza(Mother Nature), with Galician characters and landscapes, with fast-moving and sometimes violent plots. =Luis Coloma= Luis Coloma (Jerez de la Frontera, January 1851 - Madrid, 1914) was the son of a famous doctor. At twelve years old he entered the preparatory Naval academy of San Fernando (1863), but later left and received a master's degree in Law from the University of Seville, although he never got to practice law. He became a member of the Real Academia in 1908 and he died in 1914. He promoted literature and had a popular following. He wrote two important novels: Peque√±eces (Trivialities) and Boy. In the first he pens a critique of the high Madrid society in the years previous to the Bourbon Restoration) in the figure of Alfonso XII, son of the overthrown Isabel II. Later in life he only published writings of a historical nature, like Jerom√≠n, on Don Juan de Austria. =Leopoldo Alas (Clar√≠n)= Leopoldo Alas \\"Clar√≠n\\" Leopoldo Alas was born in Zamora in 1852, although he always felt deeply Asturian. He completed his study of law in Oviedo. He then obtained his doctorate in Madrid, where he lost faith in God. From then on he would live in permanent spiritual conflict, which is evident in his work. At the age of twenty-three, he began to use the pseudonym Clar√≠n in his work. As a professor at the University of Oviedo in 1883, he defended republican ideas, but soon tired of politics. In 1892, a crisis of conscience renewed his faith in God, although he would not adhere to the extremes of Catholic orthodoxy. He died in Oviedo in 1901. Work Clar√≠n had great prestige as a literary critic. His articles demonstrate his great knowledge and sound judgment (expressed on many occasions through scathing sarcasm). His articles, which made him a feared authority in the Spanish literary panorama, were compiled in volumes such as Solos de Clar√≠n and Paliques. He also wrote short stories and novellas; he published more than seventy short works. Among the first short stories that he composed, Pip√° (1879), which tells of the misfortunes of a picaresque figure from Oviedo, stands out. Also notable is Adi√≥s, Cordera, a classic dramatic idyll. But his reputation as a novelist is exemplified by the only two novels he wrote, La Regenta and Su √∫nico hijo; the former is more significant. With clear influences from Madame Bovary by Flaubert, it physically and morally depicts Vetusta (which was modeled on his hometown of Oviedo) as a prototypical Spanish city steeped in tradition. Alas employed naturalistic techniques, but he did not paint squalid environs as didZola; instead, what predominates is a sense of pessimism, tempered by touches of tenderness and irony. In La Regenta individuals find themselves in conflict with their own consciences (particularly its protagonist Ana Ozores, whose character is similar to Emma Bovary, except that she comes across as more sympathetic and less conniving). Characters find themselves conflicted by duty and desire. Clar√≠n's portrayal of the city was considered insulting by many. The novel was quickly condemned by the Church, although with the passage of time, Clar√≠n and the bishop of Oviedo established a firm friendship. Today La Regenta is considered to be an exemplar of Spanish Realism, in the same class as Fortunata y Jacinta by Gald√≥s. =Armando Palacio Vald√©s= Armando Palacio Vald√©s (Entralgo, Asturias, 1853 ‚Äì Madrid, 1938) was educated in Avil√©s and finished his baccalaureate in Oviedo; he pursued a career as an attorney in Madrid. He was editor of Revista Europea, where he published articles which he soon after compiled in Semblanzas literarias (1871). In 1885 he published the novel Jos√©, a realistic picture of the customs and manners of seafaring folk. After the death of Jos√© Mar√≠a de Pereda in 1905, Palacio Vald√©s assumed Pereda's position in the Real Academia Espa√±ola. Palacio Vald√©s was a good friend of Clar√≠n. He wrote several important novels, among them Marta y Mar√≠a, in which the two Biblical sisters are transported to a contemporary setting and fight against the false mysticism of the time. The most popular of his works is La monja de San Sulpicio (The Nun from San Sulpicio), in which he narrates the adventures that precede the marriage of a Galician doctor with the protagonist, a nun without vocation who does not renew her vows. Also notable is El pueblo perdido (The Lost Village), a dramatic history of a town ruined by mining. =Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez= Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez was born in Valencia in 1867. He harbored radical republican ideas for which he was repeatedly arrested and finally exiled. He was a deputy during seven sessions of the national legislature. In 1909 he left for Argentina in search of fortune, but his attempt failed. He supported the Allies during World War I (1914‚Äì1918); with the war as backdrop, he wrote Los cuatro jinetes del apocalipsis (The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse), a novel of great worldwide success. He led the life of a cosmopolitan millionaire and many of his stories were adapted for Hollywood. He died in 1928 in Menton, C√¥te d'Azur, France. His remains were transferred to Valencia in 1933, where they were received triumphantly. Blasco produced an enormous number of novels. Works set in Valencia, so intensely loved by the writer, stand out. Among these are Arroz y tartana (Rice and Carriage), La barraca (The Farmhouse), Entre naranjos (Among Orange Trees), Ca√±as y barro (Canes and Clay). He reflected his political, social and anti-religious ideas in La catedral) (The Cathedral) or La bodega (The Warehouse), although his fame is due to a great extent to Los cuatro jinetes del apocalipsis, a work which deals with family dramas during the Great War. Valencian works of Blasco are preferred by critics. He has been compared with √âmile Zola because he shares with the French novelist a subversive attitude, a predilection for squalid environs, and a preoccupation with biological inheritance. He writes intensely and his style can be described as coarse, although it does not lack images of purity. Although a contemporary of the Generation of '98, his worldly spirit differs from the asceticism and the culture of those writers. Poetry While it is true that towards the second half of the 19th century the novel evolved quickly towards Realism, this did not happen to poetry and to drama, whose transformation was less violent and still continued to be infused with Romanticism until the end of the century. This late Romanticism is more apparent than real; sometimes it lacks depth and the lyric exaltation to which the true romantic abandoned himself. This is due to the social reality of the moment: the time in which the bourgeoisie would consolidate the Restoration of 1875. This society, which was laying the foundations of Capitalism and was taking the first steps of industrialization in the country, did not leave room for the people who admired art for art's sake. The most representative writers are Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce and Ram√≥n de Campoamor, sometimes considered as opponents of Romanticism, because Romanticism was still in its final throes as is evidenced in the classic works of Gustavo Adolfo B√©cquer and Rosal√≠a de Castro. =Ram√≥n de Campoamor= Ram√≥n de Campoamor was born in Navia, Asturias, in 1817, and died in 1901. He belonged to the Moderate Party, and was an employee of the Treasury, governor of three Spanish provinces and a deputy in Parliament. He wrote treatises on philosophical subjects (El absoluto), dramatic plays, and poems of epic and philosophical pretensions (Col√≥n, El drama universal and El licenciado Torralba). Nevertheless, his most personal creations are his small poems, like Humoradas, Doloras and Small poems. With them he tried to break with Romanticism, creating a poetry in accordance with the moment: prosaic, simple, skeptical and in some cases ironic, with a moral that is usually trivial. Today it is considered to be simple by scholars. Campoamor explained his innovative ideas in Po√©tica, where he says: =Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce= Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce (1834‚Äì1903) was born in Valladolid. He was governor of Logro√±o, parliamentary deputy, senator of the Cortes, and foreign minister. He wrote dramas, such as El haz de le√±a (The bundle of firewood), that deals with the theme of the prince Don Carlos, son of Philip II, a subject already treated by Schiller. He excelled in the field of poetry, where he was a prolific writer. N√∫√±ez de Arce was a careful poet, yet his poems are loaded with political artifice (as in Gritos del cobate (Combat Cries), where he endeavored to create a civic and patriotic poetry) in exalted speeches of philosophical musings (La duda, English: Doubt). He is also often accused of using rhetoric that is too facile. He also wrote stories or legends in verse, like Un idilio (An iIdyll), La pesca (Fishing) and El v√©rtigo (Vertigo). =Other poets= Although less important, there were also other poets who followed realism, among them: * Ventura Ruiz Aguilera (1820‚Äì1881): Born in Salamanca and author of Ecos nacionales (National Echoes), patriotic legends, and Eleg√≠as (Elegies). * Vicente Wenceslao Querol (1836‚Äì1889): Native of Valencia, author of Rimas (Rhymes). * Federico Balart (1831‚Äì1905): wrote Dolores , a collection of elegies written about the death of his wife. * Emilio Ferrari (1850‚Äì1907): from Valladolid, imitated N√∫√±ez de Arce. * Jos√© Velarde (1849‚Äì1892): as Emilio Ferrari, also followed in the footsteps of N√∫√±ez de Arce. * Manuel Reina (1856‚Äì1905): imbued his poems with the color of his native Andalusia. * Joaqu√≠n Bartrina (1850‚Äì1880): Born in Barcelona, he took the humor and the ordinariness of Ram√≥n de Campoamor to the extreme, to which he added a materialistic pessimism, in his work Algo (Something). The theater The Spanish Realist theater contains a wide spectrum of works, from the most conservative and non-critical positions to the most progressive and acid ones: from the high comedy of Adelardo L√≥pez de Ayala and Ventura de la Vega, to the ethically overwrought theater of Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s and the sharp critique of Enrique Gaspar. Apart from these authors, the interest in costumbrismo reflected the most conservative mores of the bourgeois public. Costumbrismo had a new beginning, through genres like the zarzuela or g√©nero chico, the sainete or \\"theater by the hour\\". It was fundamentally a theater of middle class evasion of social problems, avoiding the creation of crises of conscience for the bourgeoisie. Alongside this, it tried to revitalize the old fashioned conservative value of honor through initiatives to revive romantic historical drama. These are exemplified by the works of Manuel Tamayo y Baus and by the Neo-Romanticism of the mathematician Jos√© Echegaray. =Jos√© Echegaray= Jos√© Echegaray (1832‚Äì1916) was born in Madrid and occupied high political positions. He was a civil engineer, as well as a director of a civil engineering school. He alternated the study of mathematical and scientific problems (on which he published two books: Ciencia popular (Popular Science) and Vulgarizaci√≥n cient√≠fico (Scientific Vulgarization) with his production of dramatic poetry, which, according to L√°zaro Carreter, \\"gives him a certain systematic bluntness that shows poetic effort more than poetic instinct\\". In 1904 the Nobel Prize was granted to him, along with Fr√©d√©ric Mistral of Provence. Echegaray tried to combine two incompatible elements: an exaggerated romanticism with the latent positivism and realism of his time. This results in a theater of contemporary custom, using the Romantic method, in which, according to critics, he goes too far in his use of tragic and pathetic situations. Crises of conscience and ideological problems predominate as themes in his work. Un conflicto entre los deberes (Conflict of Interest) exemplifies these themes. Among his most outstanding works are: El loco dios (The Crazy God), La mancha que limpia (The Stain That Cleans), El gran Galeoto (The Great Galeoto), and O locura, o santidad (Either Madness or Sanctity). =Manuel Tamayo y Baus= Manuel Tamayo y Baus (1829‚Äì1898) was born in Madrid. He was the son of actors and he married the daughter of the famous actor Isidoro M√°iquez. He was in permanent contact with the theater and he covered a great variety of subjects in his works. He wrote classic tragedies (Virginia), romantic dramas (La locura del amor, in English The Madness of Love, about Juana la Loca), Costumbrista theater (La bola de nieve, in English The Snowball and Lo positivo, in English The Positive) and social theater (Incidentes de honor, in English Incidents of Honor and Los hombres buenos, in English The Good Men). His most important work is Un drama nuevo (A New Drama), in which he showcases the theater company of Shakespeare, which is to represent a drama that unintentionally mirrors the reality of the actors' lives. Yorick discovers through jealous fellow actor Walton that Alicia, who plays the role of unfaithful wife in the work, is unfaithful to him in reality as well. In his quest for revenge, Walton is determined to let Yorick know that Alicia loves Edmundo and, when he opportunely gets the evidence he needs, he substitutes Edmundo's letter to Alicia for the prop letter and presents it to Yorick during the performance. At this point Yorick is enmeshed in both the play he is presenting and the drama of his own discovery and kills Edmundo on stage before the audience. Finally Shakespeare explains to the audience what has happened: the play cannot go on because Yorick got so involved in his stage role that he killed his rival. Shakespeare also reveals, without implicating himself, that Walton is dead as well, having been found stabbed outside on the street. =Other dramatists= In addition to the mentioned ones, also the following stand out: * Adelardo L√≥pez de Ayala (1828‚Äì1865): He occupied high political positions (Minister and President of the Congress). He developed high comedy with works like El tanto por ciento (The Percentage), El tejado de vidrio (The Glass Tile Roof), Consolaci√≥n (Consolation) and El nuevo Don Juan (The New Don Juan), in which he explored moral themes. * Eugenio Sell√©s (1844‚Äì1926): wrote The Gordian Knot, in which he showed the problems of marriage. * Enrique Gaspar (1842‚Äì1902): Author of comedies like La levita (The Frock Coat), Las personas decentes (Decent People) and Las circunstancias (The Circumstances), which reflect the bourgeois atmosphere of his time. * Jos√© Feli√∫ y Codina (1845‚Äì1897): wrote the rural drama La Dolores (Dolores) and theater of regional customs. * Leopoldo Cano (1844‚Äì1934): His most outstanding works are La Pasionaria (The Passion Flower) and La mariposa, (The Butterfly). Among the librettists of zarzuelas, Marcos Zapata, Ricardo de la Vega, Jos√© L√≥pez Silva and Miguel Ramos Carri√≥n stand out; and among the authors of sainetes, Tom√°s Luce√±o and Vital Aza stand out. Criticism: Men√©ndez y Pelayo Men√©ndez y Pelayo Men√©ndez y Pelayo was perhaps the preeminent figure of Spanish culture in the 19th century, master of the history of ideas, history, and the contemporary criticism. He was born in Santander in 1856 and he studied in several countries. When he was twenty-two years old he was awarded an endowed chair in the University of Madrid. When he was twenty-five he was appointed member of the Real Academia Espa√±ola, and a little later, member of the Real Academia de Historia. He also directed the Biblioteca Nacional. When he died in 1912 he left as legacy to Santander his valuable personal library. The work of Men√©ndez y Pelayo is very extensive and demonstrates a great capacity for synthesizing data. In his books his love for Spain and a passionate Catholicism are in evidence. He tried to reconstruct all the historical past of Spain, with a revisionist purpose that on several occasions placed him at the center of major controversies (for example, the one originated by his book La ciencia espa√±ola (The Spanish Science). For many critics he defined the boundaries of Spanish thought in works like Historia de los heterodoxos espa√±oles (History of the Heterodox Spaniards) and the Historia de la est√©tica espa√±ola (History of Spanish Aesthetics). With respect to literary history, he wrote works such as Las or√≠genes de la novela (Origins of the Novel), Antolog√≠a de los poetas l√≠ricas (Anthology of Lyric Poets) (which finishes at the end of the Middle Ages), and the prologue to Obras de Lope de Vega (Works of Lope de Vega), among others. Feminist movement and Arenal Concepci√≥n Arenal was a Spanish feminist writer and activist. She was also a pioneer and founder of the feminist movement in Spain. Concepci√≥n Arenal and her husband collaborated closely on the liberal newspaper Iberia until Fernando's death in 1859. Penniless she was forced to sell all her possessions in Arma√±o and moved into the house of violinist and composer Jes√∫s de Monasterio in Potes, Cantabria, where in 1859 she founded the feminist group Conference of Saint Vincent de Paul in order to help the poor. Two years later the Academy of Moral Sciences and Politics awarded her a prize for her work \\"Beneficence, philanthropy and charity\\". It was the first time the Academy gave the prize to a woman. She also attended political and literary debates, unheard of at the time for a woman. In later years she published poetry books and essays such as \\"Letters to delinquents\\" (1865), \\"Ode against slavery\\" (1866), \\"Convicts, the people and the executioner\\" and \\"The execution of the death sentence\\" (1867). In 1868 she was named Inspector of Women's Correctional Houses and in 1871 began fourteen years of collaboration with the Madrid-based magazine The Voice of Charity. In 1872 she founded the Construction Beneficiary, a society dedicated to building cheap houses for workers. She also worked with the Red Cross helping the injured of the Carlist War, working in a hospital in Miranda de Ebro, later being named Secretary General of the Red Cross between 1871 and 1872. In 1877 she published Penitentiary Studies. Arenal's achievements were extraordinary in a largely traditional Spain, focusing her work on those marginalised in society. She wrote not only extensively on the state of prisons for both men and women, but also on the role of women in society in works such as La Mujer del Porvenir (1869), The education of women, The current state of women in Spain, The work of women, The woman of the house (1883) and domestic service. It is this work which made her known as the founder of the feminist movement in Spain.

Located from Oslo Central Station, it is served by long-distance and regional trains on the Dovre Line, as the terminus for regional trains on the R√∏ros Line. All trains are operated by SJ Norge, except the regional trains between Lillehammer and Oslo, which are operated by Vy. A side platform and an island platform are in regular use. The station handled 1,062,300 passengers in 2008. The station opened on 23 June 1862 as the western terminus of the narrow-gauge Hamar‚ÄìGrundset Line, today the R√∏ros Line. The first station building, in Swiss chalet style, was designed by Georg Andreas Bull. Increased traffic caused the construction of a second station building, designed by Balthazar Conrad Lange. It opened in 1880 with the first part of the Dovre Line, which connected Hamar to Oslo. The current station building is designed by Paul Due in historicism. It received major renovations in the 1970s and ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The Dovre Line past Hamar will be upgraded to double track, and in conjunction with this moving the station is being considered. History Hamar was incorporated as a town in 1849 and by 1861 had a population of 1,700.Norwegian State Railways: 8 Proposals for a railway from Hamar to Elverum were first launched in 1854. The goal was to provide train services across the valley ridge to √òsterdalen, where Elverum acted as an important node. From Hamar, the a steam ship service was proposed across the lake of Mj√∏sa to Eidsvoll, where passengers and cargo could be hauled by train to the capital and coast. The plan was approved by Parliament on 3 September 1857.Bjerke & Stenersen: 16 The necessity of transshipment to steam boat meant that the station had to be located on lakefront property. The place Gammelhusstranda was chosen, but gave the unusual result that the station was situated outside the city limits until a border change in 1878.Norwegian State Railways: 9 Hamar received the railway's administration and became its operational center. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull and construction of the wooden buildings were subcontracted to Chr. Eriksen.Bjerke & Stenersen: 18 The line opened on 23 June 1862.Bjerke & Stenersen: 395 The station had limited facilities with shunting being done by horse.Bjerke & Stenersen: 202 In its original configuration the station had three tracks, a main station building, a locomotive depot and a cargo building. Two tracks received a roof. All buildings were wooden, with the two- story main building a log house with paneling in Swiss chalet style. The upper story was used as housing.Norwegian State Railways: 10 About forty people worked at the station from the opening.Norwegian State Railways: 11 View of Hamar from the south during the early 1930s. The water station was moved to the depot in 1863. Later a house adjacent to the station building was converted into a railway hotel. The docks received steam crane in 1864, followed by an extension three years later and a new crane in 1875. The traffic at Hamar increased little until 1880. Later known as the R√∏ros Line, the railway was extended further up √òsterdalen, eventually being connected with Trondheim in 1877. The main challenge was the inevitable break-of-gauge which would have to take place, as the Trunk Line had been built with standard gauge. The remaining link, the Eidsvoll‚ÄìHamar Line, later reclassified as the first part of the Dovre Line, was initially planned as narrow gauge. This was changed by Parliament in 1875, making Hamar the site of the break-of- gauge.Norwegian State Railways: 13 The area and traffic generated by transshipment was so extensive that a new station building was needed. Balthazar Conrad Lange had become NSB's head architect, and was issued the task of designing a new main station building. The second station building was located east of the old, at roughly the location of the current bus station. Also built in wood, it received a roof which hung over the platform. The old station building was converted to railway offices.Norwegian State Railways: 14 The track out of the station was moved further away from the lakeshore. The new station was taken into use in 1880. A now disused depot building With a connection to the capital, plans surfaced for the standard gauge line to be extended northwards through Gudbrandsdalen. With the extension to Sel approved in 1890, three proposals surfaced for the route through Hamar. All three cut the town off from the lakeshore. One involved the line being carried across a swing bridge which would allow access to the port, while two proposed a line across H√∏iensalodden, either the chosen route or one along Skappelsgate. The second station building had been built further away from the market square and there was a desire to build a new station closer to the town center. The site of the first station was therefore chosen as a suitable site for a new terminal building.Norwegian State Railways: 15 The initial station was moved across the street, where it remained until it was demolished in 1925.Bjerke & Stenersen: 204 Design of the third station building was commissioned to Paul Due, who was working as NSB's head architect at the time. The contract for construction was awarded to Byggmester Schilling from Kristiania. It was completed after completion of the Sel Line, being taken into use on 8 November 1897. At the same time a separate restaurant building opened. The center section of the second station was moved to the deport area, where it served as an office. An expanded depot opened in 1898. The station received electric lighting about 1900 and a new, two-track engine shed opened in 1905. Five years later a second such shed was completed, and a circular shed was finished in 1914. Class 26c steam locomotive on the turntable at Hamar in 1970 With the establishment of the Norwegian State Railways in 1883, Hamar Station became the administrative site for Hamar District. This would by 1924 reach an area consisting of the Dovre Line from Eidsvoll Station to Domb√•s Station, the Rauma Line, and the R√∏ros Line north to Tynset Station.Gjerd√•ker: 12 From 1880 to 1931 Hamar Station received a high amount of activity from its role as transshipment point between the narrow-gauge R√∏ros Line and the standard gauge Eidsvoll‚ÄìSel Line. With increasing traffic the station area grew gradually, with an increasing number of tracks, built without any long-term plan. By 1916 there were 96 switches, resulting in low speeds, inefficient and unreliable operation. Despite the number of tracks, shunting often had to be done on the main line. The track arrangements were not cleaned up until the gauge conversion on the R√∏ros Line was completed in 1931. The following year a new interlocking system was installed.Bjerke & Stenersen: 205 The restaurant building in the foreground and the station building behind it, some time between 1905 and 1912 After having been operated by Harald Larsen, the restaurant was taken over by Norsk Spisevognselskap on 1 January 1921, who paid NOK 87,786 for the inventory. The following year they redecorated it based on drawings by Gudmund Hoel, with the dining room decorated by theater painter Jens Wang. He made several large fresco paintings, including the ruins of Hamar Cathedral, motives from Mj√∏sa, √Ökersvika and an old settlement in Hedmark style. On the northern wall there were two large paintings, one of H√∏sbj√∏r Tourist Hotel and one of a view of Mj√∏sa. The renovation of the restaurant cost NOK 43,000 and was taken into use on 15 December 1922.Just: 63 A station park was installed in front of the station in 1924.Hals: 10 The Norwegian Railway Museum has its origins from 1896.Norwegian Railway Museum: 3 It gathered historical items from various railways and had from the opening of the third station until 1912 a display in the upper floor of the terminus building. At that time the station ran out of place and the museum had to relocate. It lacked a venue for more than a decade while its board searched for a proper site. This issue was settled in 1925, when the museum secured a lot to the north of Hamar Station. It could open as an open-air museum in 1930. NSB took formal ownership of the museum in 1946 and the lot on was it. A new and larger museum could was opened in 1956.Norwegian Railway Museum: 4 Class 93 diesel train at Hamar, used on the R√∏ros Line The Dovre Line south of Hamar to Eidsvoll was electrified on 15 June 1953. Electrification further north had to wait until 1 November 1966, as part of the effort to electrify the entirety of the Dovre Line.Bjerke & Holom: 75 Class 86 diesel multiple units were introduced on the R√∏ros Line in 1956, and a shed was built for them that year. Centralized traffic control opened from Tangen Station to Hamar on 30 May 1965, and onwards to Lillehammer Station on 29 April 1966. A new interlocking system was installed in 1969. The station building was renovated in the 1970s in a brutal fashion which eliminated many of the original architectural interior elements. Particularly the entrances and the central hall received contemporary elements, such as an aluminum shell. The roof ornaments were not demolished but simply covered. Automatic train stop was installed on 1 November 1983. The station park was renovated in 1990. Hamar Station received an upgrade ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics, for which Hamar was a host city. The original station building was little suited for modern use and the outdoor areas served transfer to bus, car and taxis poorly.Norwegian State Railways: 2 NSB therefore decided to demolish the cargo and electric buildings to make room for a new bus terminal.Norwegian State Railways: 3 The remaining part of the station, including the restaurant building, were renovated to as close to the original plans and interior as feasible, largely undoing the work of the 1970s.Norwegian State Railways: 4 The work involved building an underpass and an overpass to tracks 2 and 3.Norwegian State Railways: 7 The project was funded as a joint project between NSB, Hamar Municipality, Hedmark County Municipality and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Manned ticket sales by NSB were terminated on 19 January 2002 and taken over by Narvesen. Architecture The station building as seen from the track side The third and current main station building is designed by Paul Due in historicism. It is built with plastered brick, with dominant sections in red brick and details in yellow plaster. It features a prominent central section with plastered gables facing both towards the town and the platforms. The main entrances there are formed as triumphal arches in Romanesque style. The historicist design is reflected through a neo-baroque central part, New Renaissance wings, all with New Gothic and Romanesque windows and decors.Hals: 9 The otherwise symmetrical form is broken by a round staircase on the northern end. The lower floor was initially designed as public areas and The terminal building is widely regarded as Paul Due's magnum opus. It is situated at the lower end of Hamar's main street, Strandgata, with the other end of the street featuring Hamar's basar. South of the station building is Due's restaurant building. It has a similar style to the station building, but lacks symmetry. It originally had a Medieval inspired interior, but this was changed to Neoclassical in 1922.Norwegian State Railways: 18 Facilities The station is situated on the Dovre Line, from Oslo Central Station and from Trondheim Central Station, at an elevation of . Hamar Station is also the southern terminus of the R√∏ros Line.Bjerke & Holom: 79 The station has 3 tracks. Track 1 is served by a long side platform which is tall, normally used by southbound trains. Track 2 and 3 share a long and tall island platform. Track 2 normally serves trains on the R√∏ros Line, while track 3 serves northbound trains on the Dovre Line. Tracks 2 and 3 are accessible from an underpass from the station building and an overpass to the south of the station. The station building features a heated waiting room, a caf√© and kiosk, as well as luggage lockers, washrooms and ticket vending machines. It also hosts a staff canteen. Ticket sale is offered at the Narvesen kiosk. There is parking for 222 cars about from the station. A bus station and taxi stand are located south of the station, while there is bicycle parking to the north. The station is located from the Norwegian Railway Museum. Services Class 70 regional train bound for Lillehammer at Hamar Station in 2001 Hamar Station is served by all passenger trains operating along the Dovre Line and the R√∏ros Line. This includes express trains between Oslo and Trondheim, Intercity trains between Drammen and Lillehammer, and regional trains on the R√∏ros Line. Travel time to Oslo Central Station is 1 hour and 23 minutes by regional train. The station had 10,300 annual passengers in 2008. There are bus services which connect to surrounding areas. Future The Norwegian National Rail Administration is in the process of building a new, double-track, high-speed network in Eastern Norway, the Intercity Triangle. One of the three main radians is the Dovre Line from Oslo to Lillehammer. Plans call for the upgrade of the section from Oslo Airport to Hamar by 2024, and completion of the segment north of Hamar by 2030. This involves finding a new right-of-way through Hamar. Three main routes have been proposed. The western alternative will keep the station at its current location, with three different route proposals. The central alternative would move the station to the vicinity of the town hall, with the east alternative would create a new station located at Disen near Vikingskipet.

The car wears retro bodywork by Zagato, replicating the Alfa Romeo 6C 1750 Gran Sport Spider Zagato of the early 1930s, over then-modern Alfa Romeo Giulia mechanicals. Just 92 were made. History The Gran Sport was inspired by an article published by Italian car magazine Quattroruote, and was built in collaboration with Milanese coachbuilder Zagato. The first prototype was introduced in April 1965 at a coachbuilders' motor show at the Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile in Turin, while the first production version was unveiled a year later, at the New York Auto Show. Alfa Romeo supplied a purpose-built bare chassis to Zagato, where the bodies were hand-built and the cars finished. Engine, gearbox and other mechanicals were from the 105-series Giulia TI. The vehicles were sold through Alfa Romeo's dealer network. Alfa Romeo produced 12 chassis in 1965, 52 in 1966, and 29 in 1967.

Transmission, suspension and steering were all carried over from the Giulia: 5-speed gearbox, double wishbone suspension at the front and a solid axle at the rear, coil springs, and rack and pinion steering. On aesthetic grounds 15-inch knock-off wire wheels and drum brakes (front three-shoe and rear two-shoe) were fitted instead of the Giulia's steel wheels and four wheel disc brakes. The body was made of aluminium panels over a tubular framework, after Zagato's traditional construction method. The car was available in two versions: \\"Normale\\" and \\"Extra\\". As a true roadster the Gran Sport had removable side curtains and top. There was no boot lid, as a spare wheel was carried at the rear, and the luggage compartment was accessible from behind the seats.

History and profile Since 2004, when the party was legalized by the Moroccan State, its Secretary General is Mustapha Brahma who has succeeded Abdallah El Harif. since July 2012. The party has around 50 local sections in Morocco, as well as European branches for Moroccan immigrants in Spain, France, Italy and Belgium. Constituted in 1995 by members of the clandestine organization \\"Ila Al Amame\\" (Forward), integrated also sympathizers of the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Moroccan movement (MLMM). Ila Al-Amam, created in 1970 by dissidents of the short-lived Party of Liberation and Socialism (former Moroccan Communist Party), was the object of heavy repression by the Moroccan authorities; thousands of militants were imprisoned (the majority receiving ten-year prison sentences); others, such as Abdellatif Zeroual, one of the founders of Ila Al Amame, died in torture centres or during the hunger strikes started in prison in order to take advantage of their rights (Saida Menebhi for example); others disappeared without the truth on their fate being known. The first national congress of the Democratic Way was held on 16 to 18 July 2004, whereas that of the youth of the Democratic Way (\\"Chabibat Annahj Addimocrati\\") was held on 22 to 24 December 2006 at the Mehdi Ben Barka Hall of Rabat. The second congress was held on July 2008, and the third national congress of the party is scheduled for 13, 14 and 15 July 2012 in Casablanca. In 2004 the party formed an alliance with Loyalty to Democracy party, the Unified Socialist Left (GSU), the Party of the Socialist Vanguard (PADS), and the National Ittihad Congress (CNI). The main objective of the Democratic Way is the construction of socialism, with a democratic society that put an end to capitalism and the human exploitation. The party criticize the \\"illusions of alternance\\", referring to the presence of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, until then the main opposition party, at the 1998 Moroccan government. Democratic Way had boycotted all the elections held since its creation (as other Moroccan parties had done in the past, for example the National Union of Popular Forces between 1972 and 2005), as they do not consider then free, neither the Moroccan regime as democratic. The Democratic Way is present in a number of causes, movements and struggles: *Their presence in the trade unions, committees for defending public social services or supporting social struggles, the unemployed university graduates movement, etc. ... , fighting against \\"savage liberalism\\" (privatization, liberalization, deregulation ... ) *The implication of its militants on the Moroccan human rights movement, opposing the human rights violations of the regime. *The struggle for democracy, denouncing the actual \\"fa√ßade democracy\\" through active campaigning for the boycott of elections, and reclaiming free and honest elections, with the base of a democratic constitution made by a Constitutive Assembly *The struggle against Moroccan dependence, cutting military (joint military exercises, NATO reunions, cooperation against \\"terrorism\\" ... ), policy and economic (Greater Middle East, Morocco‚ÄìUnited States Free Trade Agreement, the proposed Morocco-UE Free Trade Agreement, Mediterranean Union ... ) relations with imperialism. *The struggle for recognition of the Amazigh language and culture as official, and give the regions with Amazigh majorities the maximum autonomy. *The support of the people's struggles, and above them the Palestinian, Iraqi and Lebanese people's, and the struggle \\"against the normalization with the Zionist entity\\". *The support to the Sahrawi people struggle for self-determination, direct negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front and peaceful solutions. Since its first appearances, Democratic Way had supported the demonstrations of the February 20 Movement. On April 2011, Democratic Way rejected the official formula for reforming the Moroccan constitution, and called for the strengthening and consolidation of mobilization and to continue the struggle for a democratic regime. The militants of Democratic Way are present in the two principal trade unions in Morocco (the Moroccan Union of Workers - UMT, and the Democratic Confederation of Work - CDT), as well as non-governmental organisations such as the Moroccan Association for Human Rights, Attac-Morocco, the National Association of Unemployed Graduates in Morocco (ANDCM) and the women rights movement. The Democratic Way commemorate every 5 December, the \\"Day of the Martyrs\\", remembering members of Il Al-Amame killed by security forces and the ones who died in prison by torture or in hunger strikes during the \\"Years of Lead\\" of Hassan II.

AFL career Drafted by the Kangaroos in the fourth round of the 2006 AFL Draft from the Port Adelaide Magpies, Thomas made impressive performance by kicking four goals in his first pre-season game against Collingwood in the NAB Cup at Carrara Oval. Thomas made his AFL debut in Round 1 of the 2007 season, scoring no goals but five behinds in a loss against Collingwood. In 2010 Thomas led North Melbourne's goalkicking with 29 goals which included 7 against Carlton in Round 12. The 2011 season was not a successful season for Thomas. He struggled badly with kicking for goal all year and was at one stage dropped from the senior side because of this. He finished the season with 21 goals and 36 behinds. In 2012, Thomas' accuracy improved markedly and he kicked 38.19 for the season. The 38 goals for the season was his highest in a year so far. He played 19 games for the year, and was held goalless in only 3 of them. He played his 100th game in Round 12, 2012, against Gold Coast. In September 2012 he signed a two-year deal with the club to remain there until the end of 2014. In 2013, Thomas had a career-best year, kicking 53 goals for the season. He also finished seventh in the Coleman medal, the highest position for a small forward that year. In the 2014 season Thomas he finished with 45 goals and played in 23 games. He continued to play well in 2015 and 2016 and kicked 34 and 37 goals in the seasons respectfully and played in nearly all games. Thomas was delisted by North Melbourne at the end of the 2017 season. Port Adelaide flagged their interest in him following his delisting and then drafted him in the 2017 AFL rookie draft. Thomas made his debut for Port Adelaide in round 5 of the 2018 season, kicking one goal in a 34 point loss to Geelong. =Ducking controversy= In 2016, Thomas sparked debate over high tackles and whether players are purposely getting taken high and milking a free kick. After the Round 10 game against Sydney, when Thomas allegedly ducked into two tackles, Hawthorn great Dermott Brereton said that Thomas' actions were \\"not in the spirit of the game\\". Numerous coaches and supporters said the head high free kicks should be looked at and singled out Thomas. However, the North Melbourne coach, Brad Scott, pointed out that there are many duckers in the league and it happens every week but everyone seems to blame Thomas.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/more-news/lindsay-thomas- draws-criticism-for-drawing-high-contact-free-kicks/news- story/4524389fc7155648048ba5dda5a3b022 ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:North Melbourne Football Club players Category:Port Adelaide Football Club players Category:Port Adelaide Magpies players Category:Port Adelaide Football Club players (all competitions) Category:Indigenous Australian players of Australian rules football Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia Category:North Ballarat Football Club players Category:Australia international rules football team players ","title":"Lindsay Thomas (footballer)"},{"id":"10345199","text":"The Badia a Settimo The nave Crypt: the tomb of the countesses Cilla and Gasdia The granary The Badia a Settimo or Abbazia dei Santi Salvatore e Lorenzo a Settimo is a Cluniac Benedictine abbey in the comune of Scandicci, near Florence in Tuscany, Italy.

He served as Bishop of Menevia from 1 October 1980 until his appointment by Pope John Paul II as Metropolitan Archbishop of Cardiff on 25 March 1983. He served as Archbishop until his retirement on 26 October 2001. Biography=Early life= John Aloysius Ward was born in Leeds on 24 January 1929, the son of Eugene and Hannah Ward. The Ward family later moved to Wrexham, North Wales, where the young John Ward was brought up. He was educated at St. Mary's Primary School, Wrexham, and at Prior Park College, Bath. He subsequently joined the novitiate of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin whom he had known from their house at Pantasaph, North Wales. =Ministry= Once he had completed his novitiate, and his priestly studies, he was ordained to the sacred priesthood at the Franciscan Parish in Peckham in 1953. He returned to reside at Pantasaph. Fr. Ward was then appointed to be in charge of the Diocese of Menevia's travelling mission. He was appointed Parish Priest of Peckham and also Guardian of the Franciscan Friary there. In 1969 Fr. Ward was appointed Minister Provincial for the Capuchins of Great Britain. In 1970 he was appointed as an adviser to the Father General of the Capuchin Order in Rome. In this responsibility he looked after the spiritual needs of English-speaking Capuchins throughout the world. He travelled widely, going on many visitations and missions, to places such as Africa and Southeast Asia.Catholic Church in England and Wales Press Release =Episcopate= Pope John Paul II named him as Coadjutor Bishop of Menevia on 1 October 1980. He succeeded Bishop Langton D. Fox in February 1982. A short time later, on 25 March 1983, he was named Archbishop of Cardiff. Especially in his early years as Archbishop, he sought very successfully priestly vocations, and a good number were ordained by him during his tenure. Archbishop Ward was very prominent during the miners' strike; he went to London to meet with the Secretary of State for Energy.Catholic Herald Archive 1984 He also made a prominent response to the famine in Ethiopia which led to an appeal that raised a substantial sum of over ¬£100,000; it culminated in a large attendance at Mass in Cardiff Arms Park on 6 June 1985.Catholic Herald Archive 1985 Archbishop Ward also called together a Diocesan Pastoral Congress, laying down the foundations for the renewal of structures within the Archdiocese of Cardiff. He was a very strong and active supporter of ecumenism, and became the first Catholic Bishop to address the General Synod of the Church in England. He attended the 1994 Synod of Bishops in Rome on behalf of the Bishops' Conference of England and Wales.Independent Catholic News Obituary He won the support of Cardiff Catholics when, in 1996, he resisted an offer by the millionaire, Sir Julian Hodge, to build a new cathedral for Cardiff at a cost of ¬£3 million, in the heart of the city. Ward was aware of the attachment felt by Cardiff Catholics to the existing cathedral, and maintained that it was adequate.Obituary The Daily Telegraph 29 March 2007 =Retirement= Archbishop Ward retired on 26 October 2001. Ward retired to a bungalow, where he displayed his archiepiscopal coat of arms over his front door.

In 1999, the Archbishop suffered what was described at the time as a personal nightmare, when a woman claimed that he had assaulted her while parish priest in Peckham. This allegation was reported in a tabloid newspaper before the Police had conferred with the Archbishop. He was later arrested, but released without any charge.Obituary The Times 29 March 2007 In October 2000, Joseph Jordan was imprisoned for indecent assaults on boys.New Statesman, John Cornwell, 1 April 2010 Jordan had been ordained by Ward in 1998, despite Ward being warned about Jordan's behaviour by Christopher Budd, Bishop of Plymouth, under whom Lloyd started his training for the priesthood.Obituary The Guardian 28 March 2007 The day after giving an interview to the BBC programme Panorama about Jordan, he was taken to the hospital suffering from a blood clot. After a period in which Edwin Regan, Bishop of Wrexham, served as Apostolic Administrator, there was a period when the Archbishop claimed he would return to his duties once he was fully restored to health. However, following an audience with Pope John Paul, the Archbishop announced his intention to retire.
