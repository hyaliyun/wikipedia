Service history The ship was built in 1919 at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company's Alameda Works, as SS Dilworth, under United States Shipping Board contract No. 1465, as an EFC Design 1047 tank ship. In October 1943 the Vice Chief of Naval Operations requested that the War Shipping Administration's Auxiliary Vessels Board acquire 35 elderly tankers for use as mobile floating storage ships at advanced bases in the Pacific area. He later directed that these vessels be armed, and equipped with the necessary fittings for use in transferring fuel oil to other vessels. In August 1944 four of these tankers were assigned to Service Force, Seventh Fleet, in the Southwest Pacific Area. Dilworth and three other ships were sent to Brisbane, Australia, to fulfill this requirement. The vessels were not expected to meet Navy standards, but had to be in good enough condition to travel to the forward area and on arrival be capable of receiving and discharging fuel to other vessels as required. Dilworth was transferred to the Navy from the War Shipping Administration at Brisbane on 31 May 1945, and commissioned on 2 June as Clifton, with Lieutenant D. M. Cranford, USNR, in command. She sailed from Brisbane on 13 June, and served as station tanker at Leyte (12 July-2 August), Manila (5‚Äì29 August), and Kanoya, Japan (8 September-2 November). She returned to the United States via Pearl Harbor and San Pedro, California, and arrived at Mobile, Alabama, on 14 January 1946. She was decommissioned there on 21 February and returned to the custody of the War Shipping Administration the same day. She was sold in January 1947, and scrapped by September.

Right: in low density) WI-38 is a diploid human cell line composed of fibroblasts derived from lung tissue of a 3-month- gestation aborted female fetus. The cell line, isolated by Leonard Hayflick in the 1960s, has been used extensively in scientific research, with applications ranging from developing important theories in molecular biology and aging to the production of most human virus vaccines. The contributions from this cell line towards human virus vaccine production have been credited with avoiding disease in, or saving the lives of, billions of people. History The WI-38 cell line stemmed from earlier work by Hayflick growing human cell cultures. In the early 1960s, Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorhead at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania discovered that when normal human cells were stored in a freezer, the cells remembered the doubling level at which they were stored and, when reconstituted, began to divide from that level to roughly 50 total doublings (for cells derived from fetal tissue). Hayflick determined that normal cells gradually experience signs of senescence as they divide, first slowing before stopping division altogether. This finding is the basis for the Hayflick limit, which specifies the number of times a normal human cell population will divide before cell division stops. Hayflick's discovery later contributed to the determination of the biological roles of telomeres. Hayflick claimed that the finite capacity of normal human cells to replicate was an expression of aging or senescence at the cellular level. During this period of research, Hayflick also discovered that if cells were properly stored in a freezer, cells would remain viable and that an enormous number of cells could be produced from a single starting culture. One of the cell strains that Hayflick isolated, which he named WI-38, was found to be free of contaminating viruses, unlike the primary monkey kidney cells then in use for virus vaccine production. In addition, WI-38 cells could be frozen, then thawed and exhaustively tested. These advantages led to WI-38 quickly replacing primary monkey kidney cells for human virus vaccine production. WI-38 has also been used for research on numerous aspects of normal human cell biology. Applications WI-38 was invaluable to early researchers, especially those studying virology and immunology, since it was a readily available cell line of normal human tissue. Unlike the HeLa cell line, which were cancerous cells, WI-38 was a normal human cell population. Researchers in labs across the globe have since used WI-38 in their discoveries, most notably Hayflick in his development of human virus vaccines. Infected WI-38 cells secrete the virus, and can be cultured in large volumes suitable for commercial production. Virus vaccines produced in WI-38 have prevented disease or saved the lives of billions of people. Vaccines produced in WI-38 include those made against adenoviruses, rubella, measles, mumps, varicella zoster, poliovirus, hepatitis A and rabies.

These jumpers are often knitted. A more traditional approach is often a roll neck (or \\"turtleneck\\") top-pulled garment. History In the United Kingdom, Christmas jumpers became popular during the 1980s after a variety of television presenters such as Gyles Brandreth and Timmy Mallett began wearing them during the Christmas holidays. In particular, their popularity may be attributed to the influence of singers such as Andy Williams and Val Doonican, who appeared in these type of jumpers in their television Christmas specials. In Ireland, The Late Late Show's host wears an extravagant jumper for the Christmas Late Late Toy Show. They are often seen as a hand-made present knitted by an elderly relative that are given as a Christmas present. During the 1990s and 2000s they were seen as gag gifts and fell out of favour and featured as something to be embarrassed by as in the 2001 film Bridget Jones's Diary. They gained camp appeal during the 2010s, with online retailer Amazon reporting an increase in sales of 600% in 2011, and the trend has been followed by a number of celebrities. Ugly Christmas Sweater Contests are held annually in the United States. Christmas jumpers in a British supermarket, 2016 In 2012, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph described them as \\"this season's must have\\", with retailer Topman selling 34 different designs alone and reporting sales had increased 54% compared to 2011. Higher end fashion labels have also produced Christmas jumpers, including Burberry and Jil Sander, and even metal band Slayer released one as part of their merchandise range. The charity Save the Children runs an annual Christmas Jumper Day each year in December using the slogan \\"Make the world better with a sweater\\". It encourages people to raise money for the charity by wearing their Christmas jumpers on a specific day. The New York Times reported in 2012 that a major venue for sweater sales are independent company websites, with ugly-sweater themed names.

The role was introduced by the show's then head writers Dena Higley and Christopher Whitesell on November 20, 2009. The role was initially portrayed by Gabriela Rodriguez, however, several months later producers made the decision to age Gabi. In July 2010, it was announced that Rodriguez was replaced by Camila Banus. Banus first aired on October 4, 2010. Originally described as a sweet, innocent, and loving girl, a number of events since Gabi's arrival on the series have altered her personality. In 2012, the character experienced a personality shift, which would reveal her manipulative side that was called \\"crazy\\" and obsessive. Her storylines have included the death of her sister Arianna Hernandez (Lindsay Hartley), her first love (Will) coming to terms that he is gay, and romances with Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick, Billy Flynn), Nick Fallon (Blake Berris), JJ Deveraux (Casey Moss), Eli Grant (Lamon Archey), Stefan DiMera (Tyler Christopher/ Brandon Barash) and Jake Lambert (also Barash). Gabi is of Latin descent, and Banus has expressed her pride to represent the Hispanic community through her portrayal. Banus' portrayal of Gabi earned her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2015.  Casting  Gabriela Rodriguez first appeared in the role of Gabi on November 20, 2009. Of auditioning, Rodriguez said \\"It was honestly so random. I had never auditioned for a soap opera before and I was like \\"wow this is different. I think I want to give it a try.\\" She seemed like such a cool girl, I was like \\"hey let's go for it.\\" [...] I ended up talking with the casting director for a while and she just kind of explained to me about the character [...] The next day I got called for a callback and that was that.\\" Fellow Hispanic actress Camilla Banus had also auditioned. Banus stated \\"I went in and read for the role. It was actually a pretty long process. The first audition then the second audition, then I went in again to meet the casting director and the producer. They then said they wanted me for a screen test. I did the screen test and they ended up not choosing me. They ended up going with the other girl [Rodriguez]. They told me that they wanted to go a little bit younger for the part.\\" In July 2010, Soap Opera Digest reported that Rodriguez had been replaced by Banus. Banus was previously best known for her role as Lola Montez on One Life to Live. Banus, who first aired as Gabi on October 4, 2010, said that the transition was \\"super easy\\" and she was welcomed onto the set with \\"lots of love\\". Explaining her being hired by Days of our Lives, Banus said that two months after her initial audition she was again offered the role of Gabi by its casting director due to the character being aged, but rejected them because of other career projects. She recalled thinking \\"Days is over\\" again and \\"they were never going to call me again\\". Two months after this, Banus received a second call asking her to reconsider; she said \\"At that point I felt there was something there and that I HAD to do this, like it was something that was calling me and I said, ‚ÄòYes.‚Äô\\" At the 2013 Emmy ceremony, Banus revealed that she would be departing from the series when her current contract expired. Her announcement followed the news that her costars Casey Deidrick and Chandler Massey were also leaving. Banus last aired on June 12, 2014, and briefly appeared from December 22 to 29, 2014. On April 24, 2015, it was confirmed that Banus would be reprising the role of Gabi to take part in the soap's fiftieth anniversary celebrations; Banus returned on September 17, 2015. In April 2018, Banus announced she had extended her deal with the soap for an additional year. In July 2020, it was announced she would once again exit the role. The following month, Corday Productions announced that Banus' exit would be short-lived, and that she is scheduled to return to filming in September.  Character development  Characterization and family Initially, Gabi was \\"sweet\\" and \\"innocent\\". During an interview with TV Source magazine, Rodriguez described Gabi as \\"very loving\\", and said \\"even though sometimes she can come off like loudmouth and just like I guess bratty, but she's not. She's a really good girl and has a really big heart. She loves her brother and sister and would do anything for them.\\" Rodriguez said that she is sensitive, has a strong personality and shows her soft side with people she's \\"comfortable with\\", and believed these were all traits Gabi has. Banus feels that she is like Gabi in the sense that she's \\"very, very sassy\\", stating \\"When Gabi has that kind of fiery thing, that‚Äôs totally Camila. Gabi is very motherly and likes helping the people that she loves, which is very much like me as well.\\" She said that Gabi is sensitive when people say things about her. Gabi has three siblings: Rafe (Galen Gering), Arianna (Lindsay Hartley) and Dario Hernandez (Francisco San Martin). Rodriguez said that although they get into \\"little bickering fights every once in a while\\", the siblings love each other. Banus said that compared to her three siblings, Gabi \\"is extremely independent, responsible and she has been on her own for a little bit\\", but noted that \\"She is a family girl and loves taking care of family.\\" She enjoys working with Galen, having stated \\"I love working with him. I think he‚Äôs my favorite person to work with, because we just have that brother and sister relationship.\\" Banus loves playing the \\"evil bitch\\"-type character, and had that opportunity when Gabi underwent a personality change in 2012. About.com said that she was \\"the epitome of sweetness and light\\" but a rocky road led by finding out her first love Will Horton (Chandler Massey) was gay lead the character to undergo a \\"major personality switch\\". Of Gabi's transformation from a \\"sweet girl\\" to doing terrible things, Banus said \\"things I think are going on in Gabi‚Äôs head that nobody gets to see\\". The actress who enjoys playing the \\"dark side of Gabi\\" credited Ariana's death as the reasoning for Gabi's life going downhill. The actress sent a message to fans, \\"I want to tell them to be patient with me. The girl they once knew will come back.\\" The new Gabi was described as \\"obsessive and crazy\\" and also \\"manipulative\\" and \\"psycho\\", which received flack from fans. Banus confessed to seeing the backlash on social media websites including Twitter. She said \\"People say mean things, but it doesn‚Äôt really get to me at all. I‚Äôm used to it\\". She noted that her previous role, Lola Montez on One Life to Live, was worse, stating \\"When I was on One Life to Live I was worse than Gabi is right now. She was a bad girl. She popped holes in condoms. That‚Äôs pretty bad. She took acid. That‚Äôs pretty bad.\\"  Relationship with Chad DiMera  While the role was still being portrayed by Rodriguez, Gabi had a brief romance with Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick). However, Chad left her for Mia McCormick (Taylor Spreitler). Rodriguez said that Gabi was still into him, but was \\"heartbroken because they really didn't have a chance at a real relationship. It was just kind of left like on the verge of something new and interesting. She was just starting to like him and she didn't know where it was going.\\" She felt that the relationship had potential, as Gabi still \\"might have a little thing for him\\". In January 2012, the romance was re-visited in a storyline which Deidrick felt that the writers dropped their brief past, and \\"You'd never know that happened if you were tuning into Days for the first time now.\\" Gabi and Chad became \\"superstar models\\" as the new faces of Countess Wilhelmina Cosmetics. This included a \\"steamy ad campaign\\", which Banus described as them having \\"no clothes and they're dripping wet. It's pretty intense.\\" However, Chad was in a committed relationship with Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett) at the time. On-Air On-Soaps wrote: \\"So will this be a case of fatal attraction? If so, Melanie better watch out, given that we have seen Banus play man-crazy when she went off the rails as One Life to Lives Lola Montez.\\" Banus felt that it wasn't love, but an infatuation, \\"[Gabi] is obsessed with having the ideal boyfriend because she has never had an ideal boyfriend. The person she thought was the ideal boyfriend turned out to be gay.\\" She also noted during an interview with TV Guide that \\"Gabi is attracted to Chad and she sees this modeling thing as a way to be near him.\\" Everyone at the photoshoot felt that they made a good couple, while Deidrick said \\"Meanwhile, Chad's like, \\"Huh? What?\\" He's clueless.\\" Banus called her attraction to Chad a \\"rebound\\" from Will; Deidrick said \\"He's oblivious to her feelings, which is hard because Camila is such a beautiful woman.\\" Gabi was shocked to find out that Chad was dating Melanie when she showed up to the photoshoot and shared a kiss with Chad. Banus said that Gabi: \\"sees Chad with Melanie and realizes she is not the girl for Chad. Gabi is the girl for Chad. So she focuses all her time and devotes her energy to making sure that is clear to him. At the point where they are at, I think she would do a lot to get that, and that is where she is at right now.\\" However, she noted that \\"Melanie, deep down, is really her friend. And honestly, she really does care about Melanie a whole lot and never wants to see her get hurt. Gabi knew Melanie being kidnapped by her stalker, Andrew but didn't do anything because Andrew blackmailed her. Chad discovered this and has since had a bitter vendetta against Gabi, despising her.  Relationship with Will Horton  Chandler Massey (pictured) plays Gabi's \\"first love\\", Will Horton. The couple split after he came out as gay Following Arianna's tragic death, Gabi leaned on her sister-in-law Sami Brady's (Alison Sweeney) son, Will Horton (Chandler Massey) for support. Of a possible Will and Gabi pairing, Rodriguez said \\"I think that would be so perfect. They're so compatible. They're just very good people. I think that would be fun, and I think the audience would like that.\\" Both virgins, the couple had sex. However, Will soon lost all interest in sleeping with her again which was unsettling to Gabi. Banus said \\"To be completely denied by him in this way is definitely going to make her feel like something is wrong with her.\\" She also stated \\"Gabi loves Will. Before they were ever boyfriend and girlfriend, they were best friends, who were there for each other.\\" It was then announced by Days of our Lives that Will would come out as gay. Banus looked forward to playing the \\"fallout\\", and said \\"For me there are so many questions [...] How is Gabi going to react? Is she going to turn to somebody [else]? Is she going to break up with Will? Is he going to go behind her back? So many things could happen that could affect Gabi, her brother, Sami ... It's going to be an amazing storyline.\\" Previewing Gabi's reaction, the actress said: \\"I feel like when it happens she is going to understand what it was. She is going to go through all those occasions where she felt something weird between them and know what it was. Obviously she will feel hurt because she's invested a lot.\\" The couple eventually parted ways. Banus said that Gabi knew things weren't \\"completely 100 percent\\" during their relationship despite the fact that she loves and cares for him. She explained that \\"when they do break up and he comes out to her, she always honestly feels like everything is her fault. And she blames herself for a lot of things.\\" Chandler said \\"Will loves her as well. There is just no sexual/physical attraction.\\" Prior, viewers picked up on the fact that Will's lack of physical connection with her became one of Gabi's \\"minor obsessions\\". Banus joked that his affection was \\"all she wants\\". Chandler noted that \\"There's no doubt Will loves Gabi [...] It's just not in the 'let's get freaky' way\\". Additionally, the actor felt that the show \\"didn't drop the dynamic\\" of the couple after he came out, but it became \\"more powerful\\".  Nick Fallon and pregnancy  In August 2012, Will and Gabi both ended up having \\"a bad week\\" and have sex, despite him previously announcing he was gay. Nothing developed from this. Following her ordeal with Will, Banus said \\"Gabi needs a man. It‚Äôs really important. If she doesn‚Äôt get a man soon, she‚Äôs going to go ballistic. It needs to be somebody that she doesn‚Äôt choose, but they choose her.\\" It was announced that Blake Berris would return as former \\"braniac\\" Nick Fallon who was just let out of prison. Banus said that if he was paired with Gabi, they could be \\"crazy together\\". Nick and Gabi eventually inched closer and quickly began a romance in October 2012. During an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Banus explained their relationship: \\"Since both Gabi and Nick were in such dark places in their lives, they don't trust what is happening to them... There's a part of them that feels, I'm not good enough to have this happen.\\" Berris said: \\"Camila is very funny, and I'm not sure she gets to play that often on screen.\\" Additionally, Berris said of the pairing: \\"I love Camila. She‚Äôs awesome, and Nick and Gabi are an interesting pairing. Both characters have gone through so much. I like how slowly they built [the relationship]. Nick was almost freaked out about what would happen to him, if he got involved with somebody.\\" That November, Gabi received shocking news that she was pregnant. Janet Di Lauro of About.com said \\"Let's face it. It's a move viewers saw coming, after a down- and-out Gabi shared a night of passion with her gay ex, Will.\\" Gabi nearly had an abortion but decided to go ahead with the pregnancy. Despite Will being the unborn baby's biological father, Gabi and Nick convinced Will to let them raise the baby as their own. He agreed, and they have begun planning their wedding. At the wedding, Chad‚Äîstill nursing a grudge over her part in his breakup with Melanie‚Äîannounced that Gabi was pregnant when she and Nick met. This made Will admit to being the father of Gabi's baby. She and Nick get married in March 2013. Nick blackmailed Will into giving up his parental rights. She gave birth to her daughter, Arianna Grace Horton in May 2013 and Nick‚Äîafter Will saved his life‚Äîallowed Will to be her father. When he revealed to Gabi about his blackmailing Will and not wanting him in her or the baby's life because Will was gay, she sought an annulment. When Nick plots to remove Will from Arianna's life and become her primary guardian, Gabi and Nick have a physical altercation in which Gabi strikes him with a rock to keep him from raping her, \\"killing\\" him (or so she believes). Sami and Kate help Gabi dump him in the river in which he wakes up before believing he drowned. However, he returns continues to blackmail Gabi until the character was killed in a whodunit murder mystery.  Storylines  2009‚Äì2014 Gabriella Josephina Hernandez is born in 1992 or 1993 in Salem, Illinois.Arianna Horton's birth certificate list Gabi's full name, Gabriella Josephina Hernandez, age, 20, and apparently place of birth as Salem. June 5, 2013.Camila Banus listed Gabi's name as Gabriela Josefina Hernandez on Twitter. June 26, 2013. She is the younger sister of Rafe, the late Arianna, and Dario Hernandez. Rafe and Arianna felt that they were being stalked while at the Brady pub, but were shocked to find out that Gabi had come to Salem and was spying on them. Initially for her winter break, Gabi decided to permanently move to Salem, and moved into a vacant room at the Brady Pub. Arianna and Gabi briefly argued but eventually bonded. She befriended other local teens including Chad Peterson- Woods (later revealed to be Chad DiMera). They briefly dated, but he left her for Mia. Saddened by the break-up, Gabi focused herself fully on school. She befriended Will Horton who attended the Salem High formal as her date. Arianna was killed in a hit-and-run accident. She leaned on Will for support and they shared their first kiss. The couple's romance deepened as they were there for one another during mutual times of crisis. They slept together, but Gabi noticed that Will didn't want to sleep with her again. He later came out as gay, and they split up. Gabi earned a job at Quinn Hudson's (Bren Foster) Intensity Day Spa and developed another crush on Chad, and began scheming to break him and his girlfriend Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett) up. To make Chad worry over her, she pretended to have a stalker, writing fake threatening notes. Chad had Gabi move in with him. So further keep up with her lie, she hired a guy named Andrew to pose as her stalker. Eventually, Andrew's actions became too much and Gabi told him to stop. He ended up kidnapping Melanie, to Gabi's knowledge. Andrew blackmailed Gabi into not telling anybody about Melanie. The truth was eventually revealed, and Chad hated Gabi for it. Feeling down, she ended up having a one night stand with Will, but agreed that it was a mistake. Chad consistently reminded Gabi that she would continue to pay for what she did. She then began a relationship with Nick, who was released from jail after serving time because he kidnapped Melanie. Nick reassured everyone he was a changed man. Chad assaulted Nick, who promised not to press charges if Chad dropped his threats towards Gabi, which he did. Gabi and Nick began planning their happy future, but she realized that she was pregnant with Will's child. Eventually, Gabi, Nick and Will decided that they would pretend that Nick is the father, and Gabi and Nick decided to get married. But when Gabi accidentally let it slip that she is further along than she originally said, Nick covered for her, saying that the two had a one-night stand the day they met. Despite there being some anger at this, everyone has accepted the duo as a couple, except for Chad, who wants Gabi to pay for her misdeeds. Chad told Sonny Kiriakis, Will's boyfriend, about Gabi's role in Melanie's kidnapping. Ever since, Sonny has cut all his ties to Gabi and warned Will to avoid her. On May 20, 2013, Gabi gave birth to a daughter, Arianna Grace Horton, after Gabi's sister and Rafe's deceased goddaughter. Nick finally tells Gabi about what happened to him in prison, and what he did to Will. Gabi moves in with Will, Sonny and baby Arianna and her marriage to Nick is annulled. Despite being divorced, Nick continued to be obsessed with Gabi. When Gabi refused his advances, he tried to rape her. Gabi took a rock and bashed Nick on the head. Sami and Kate arrived and help Gabi throw Nick's body in the water. Nick briefly woke up before sinking into the water, and Gabi was haunted by the fact that they had let him die. On the day of Arianna's christening, Nick showed up at the ceremony alive, and lied about the events that happened that night. Nick wanted to reconcile with Gabi and slowly spent time with her and Arianna. He tried to get Gabi to take Arianna away from Will, but was eventually shot and killed with Gabi revealed to be the shooter. Gabi explained that she was scared of Nick's influence over her and felt she had to kill him to stop him from being a threat to Arianna. She also admitted her role in Melanie's kidnapping and told Marlena about her, Kate and Sami throwing Nick in the river. EJ, who served as Gabi's lawyer, thought it would be better for her to have a plea deal than go to trial and have the truth about Melanie's kidnapping come out. Gabi accepted the plea deal and got ten to twenty years in prison. Gabi is visited by Rafe and later on by Will, Sonny and Arianna for the holidays. She gets another visitor, but it's Melanie, instead of Will and Sonny, who forgave Gabi her past decisions. 2015‚Äìpresent Gabi is released from prison in September 2015 and shares a happy reunion with Rafe, Will and Arianna thanks to an error made in her sentencing. As Gabi settles back into her life and relaunches her modeling career when Kate hires her at Basic Black working opposite retired baseball player Paul Narita (Christopher Sean), she is devastated when Will is murdered by a serial killer. The killings lead to Gabi's reunion with her estranged father Eduardo (A Martinez) for the first time since she was an infant as one of the serial killer victims is Gabi's half-sister Paige (True O'Brien). In December 2015, Gabi bonds with JJ Deveraux (Casey Moss) and they begin dating, but the romance is short-lived and he had cheated on her with Abe's daughter, Lani. In 2016, her best friend Abigail Devereaux DiMera (JJ's sister) is presumed dead, and Gabi later begins a relationship with her husband Chad. But in November 2016, Chad's wife Abigail returns to Salem and they reconcile, so Gabi tries to ignore her feelings for Chad. Chad and Gabi are locked in a meat locker by Deimos Kiriakis and Chad tells Gabi he loves her. Abigail, with the help of Gabi's brother Dario, who has developed feelings for Abigail himself, rescue them. Chad tells Abigail that he still has feelings for Gabi, but that he loves Abigail and wants to keep his marriage, and eventually decides he must remove Gabi from his life entirely. The day that Chad decides to tell Gabi this, Deimos kidnaps Abigail and Gabi and poisons them both and gives Chad only enough antidote to save one of the women, forcing him to choose which woman would live and which would die. Chad, however, gives half of the antidote to each one, saving both of their lives. When Gabi recovered from the poison, Andre DiMera (Thaao Penghlis) warned her about coming in between Abigail and Chad. Gabi supported Chad and Abigail's plans to remarry, but Abigail broke it off with Chad. At the time, Gabi was dating Eli Grant (Lamon Archey). Gabi went to Greece where Chad and Eli both went for different reasons. Chad went to procure amulet that was said to be cursed and Eli went with Hope, Rafe, Lani, and JJ to capture Deimos. Eli saw Gabi has feelings for Chad and broke up with her. Deimos was successfully apprehended and Hope and Rafe brought him back to Salem. Gabi, Eli, JJ, Sonny, and Paul all went with Chad, but their plans crashed, stranding them on a desert island. Gabi realized Chad had the amulet with him when he told her he had gotten rid of it, and convinced him to bury it in the sand. Gabi and Chad admitted they had feelings for each other and slept together. Paul ended up contracting jungle madness, and ended up attacking Gabi. They were rescued by John and Marlena and returned safely to town. Andre warned Gabi not to her Chad, and subtly threatened her by telling her to watch her back. Gabi and Chad continued seeing each other while Abigail got ready to marry Dario. Gabi supported the marriage, but Chad was skeptical of the rush to get married. Everything culminated with the death of Deimos, and Abigail's desire to protect Chad, which led to her getting struck by a car and the revelation that Abigai had only married Dario to stop deportation, which he lied about and then later blackmailed her to stay married to him. Gabi realized Chad still loved Abigail and broke up with him. Gabi stumbled upon evidence that Dario had sent to implicate Commissioner Lou Raines (Aaron D. Spears) as his partner. Raines finds out and held Gabi hostage. Eli saved Gabi by shooting Raines in the shoulder, and he was apprehended. Gabi and Eli reconnected as he taught her self defense, and eventually rekindled their romance. After JJ accidentally shot Theo Carver (Kyler Pettis), he struggled with the guilt and planned to commit suicide. Gabi found out and was furious with JJ. Concerned, Gabi stayed overnight to make sure JJ was alright. Gabi went to work for DiMera after signing a contract that had GabiChic work under them. Chad and Andre's long lost brother Stefan DiMera (Brandon Barash) came to town and took over DiMera. Stefan subtly flirted with Gabi, though he was interested in Abigail. Gabi was shocked and angry when Andre severed their contract with Gabi, and used a loophole to steal GabiChic from her. Gabi was furious with Andre and vowed to make him pay. The next morning, Andre was found dead on the floor of the office with blood leaking from a head wound, and the murder weapon, the furnace that contained the ashes of Tony DiMera (Thaao Penghlis), lay on the floor underneath his desk with the lid missing and the ashes scattered across the floor. Security footage showed a woman that resembled Gabi leaving the office with the lid, but Gabi swore she did not kill Andre. Gabi found out that Eli and Lani had slept together and surmised that he was the father of Lani's baby, so she broke up with him. The missing lid showed up in Gabi's purse and she attempted to get rid of it, but Lani caught her and arrested her. Chad and Abigail wee convinced that Stefan had hired someone to pose as Gabi and kill Andre. Chad vowed to find the woman, but ultimately failed. At Gabi's trial, Abigail claimed that Gabi confessed to her that she killed Andre. Gabi was found guilty and sent to prison where she was left bitter and angry that Abigail would betray her like that. Gabi was attacked in prison by a woman named Diane, who had been Raines‚Äô girlfriend and blamed her for Raines arrest. Gabi was beaten nearly to death and hospitalized. Diane attempted to finish the neck and wound up dead with a needle in her neck. Abigail finally remembered that she had killed Andre, and soon after developed DID. It was her altar, Gabby, that left the office with the lid, and her other altar, Dr. Laura, that had lied about Gabi killing Andre. Abigail confessed and attempted to apologize to Gabi, but she was furious with Abigail and her release was delayed while they investigated Diane's murder. Gabi was released when someone else bragged about killing Diane. Upon her release, Gabi found out she suffered internal injuries from her attack that made it hard for her to have children. Gabi found out Chad was the father of Abigail's baby when Kayla Brady (Mary Beth Evans) left the paternity results on her desk, so Gabi burned the paternity test and forged a new one that said Stefan was the father. Abigail planned to get abortion, so Gabi, preying on hers and Abigail's friendship went to Stefan and told him Abigail was pregnant and that he was the father. Stefan stopped Abigail from having an abortion. Later on, Gabi went to Kayla and asked for some sleeping medication that was pregnancy safe. She drugged Abigail with the medications and send a message to Stefan from her phone, so to make him believe it was from Abigail's altar, Gabby, whom Stefan had fallen for. Kate found out about Gabi's plot, and Gabi convinced her to keep quiet, eventually resorting to blackmail once Kate got in too deep and expressed reservations. Gabi's plan started to work perfectly as Chad, JJ, and Jennifer all feared Abigail was relapsing. With Kate to back her up, whom Chad trusted, it was easy to convince him. Chad left Abigail and moved into the Kiriakis mansion where Gabi was already living, and she bonded with him as her plan as to have Abigail committed and raise her children with Chad. Abigail was the only one who was suspicious of Gabi. Gabi upped the ante by dressing Abigail as Gabby and putting her in the DiMera mansion. She then whacked herself in the head with a tray and claimed Gabby had attacked her and Kate supported her story. As Chad planned to have Abigail committed, Abigail got a quick divorce from Chad and married Stefan. Luckily for Gabi, Chad was persistent and managed to get Stefan to commit Abigail. Gabi visited Abigail and gloated to Abigail, confessing everything. Abigail attacked Gabi and Chad ran in and broke them up. Abigail had no proof, so Chad continued to fall for Gabi's lies. Kate convinced Gabi to tell Chad the truth about his child, so Gabi printed a new copy from Kayla's computer and planned to make it look like Stefan had switched the results, but Stefan almost caught her and she was unable to plant the results in the mansion. Later, by Abigail's request to expose Gabi for her lies, Julie sneaked into the Kiriakis mansion and discovered the test results in Gabi's room. Gabi caught Julie with the evidence, who threatened to tell Chad everything. The two fought and Julie fell down the stairs. Julie was rushed to the hospital shortly after Chad and Sonny came to her aid. Desperate to keep Julie quiet, Gabi sneaked into Julie's room later that night in an attempt to suffocate her with a pillow, but was eventually caught by Abigail who accused her of pushing her down the stairs. Gabi continues to taunt Abigail's illness and gloats innocence... until Julie woke up and eventually told Abigail the truth, who then told Chad. A furious Chad threatened to send Gabi to prison, vowing to separate her from her only daughter the same way she separated Abigail from hers and her son. Abigail however chose not to press charges against Gabi, despite Chad's objection; but she also chose to permanently end her friendship with Gabi and wished her the best as they went on their separate ways.  Reception  Janet Di Lauro of About.com said that the character is crazy and \\"naughty.\\" Of being the only Hispanic during her time on Days of Our Lives, Banus stated in 2012: \\"I‚Äôm definitely grateful. I‚Äôm proud be a Latina, and I‚Äôm really proud to represent for all the Latinas out there; especially the young Latina women. It‚Äôs important for them to have a role. I feel really empowered to be the young Latina on the show, and I have no problem carrying all of the responsibility on my back.\\" Banus' portrayal of Gabi earned her a nomination for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series at the 42nd Daytime Emmy Awards in 2015.

The normal procedure for the election of a Patriarch requires all candidates to have been a member of the Holy Synod for at least 5 years,Section 3, paragraph 32 of the Statute of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch but reports indicate that the synod agreed to set that rule aside for this election.How Patriarch John X Yazigi was elected Antiochian Orthodox Church patriarch, 12-17-2012 Patriarch John X arrived in Damascus, Syria on December 20, 2012 for prayers in the Mariamite Cathedral of Damascus, where he also received congratulations from members, civil authorities (including the Minister for Presidential Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Mansour Fadlallah Azzam, on behalf of the President of Syria) and other well-wishers. On Sunday December 23, 2012, the solemn Divine Liturgy of installation and thanksgiving was offered by the newly elected Patriarch.Patriarch Yazigi to Arrive in Damascus on Thursday, SANA Syrian Arab News Agency, H. Sabbagh, 18 Dec 2012 In his installation sermon, Patriarch John X stressed his rejection of western interference in the Syrian civil war as well as his intention to promote peaceful co-existence with Muslims and other Syrians. The ambassador of the Russian Federation in Damascus, Azmatullah Kulmohammadov, stressed the firm support of Russia for Syrian national unity, national peace and an end to the civil war. The Antiochian Orthodox patriarch in response called upon the entire Syrian people to defend its national unity and to fight instability and insecurity.F.L./Mazen, Upon the Directives of President al-Assad, Minister Azzam Congratulates Patriarch Yazigi, 20 December 2012, SANA Syrian Arab News Agency On February 10, 2013, John X was formally enthroned as the Metropolitan Bishop of Antioch (the customary see of the Patriarch of Antioch), ceasing to be Metropolitan of Europe.The Official Website for the Enthronement of Patriarch John X of Antioch This occasion marks the commencement of John X's patriarchal reign. The enthronement took place in the principal church of the See of Antioch, the Mariamite Cathedral of Damascus, as required by tradition. However, because of the present civil war in Syria the service was necessarily restrained. A second service of enthronement took place on February 17, 2013 in the Cathedral of St Nicholas, Ashrafieh (one of the oldest Christian districts of Beirut), which was attended by Antiochian Orthodox Christians from all over the world, and especially by the President and Prime Minister of Lebanon, and the Patriarch of the Maronite Catholic Church. During his sermon, the Patriarch promised that the Antiochian Church would engage in dialogue based on mutual respect. He also promised to continue the Patriarchate's aid to all families, children and women who are suffering as a result of the conflict. On working together with the Muslim community, he said, \\"Muslims are partners in the nation, and our ties with them go beyond coexistence; we share with them the responsibility to build a [better] future and confront dangers\\".http://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/74875/1302170720-lbci-newsreport  2018 missile strikes against Syria  In April 2018, John X of Antioch, together with Moran Mor Ignatius Aphrem II and Greek Melkite Patriarch Youssef Absi, issued a strong condemnation of the 2018 missile strikes against Syria.

The IVB group has the most extreme chemical compositions of all iron meteorites, meaning that examples of the group are depleted in volatile elements and enriched in refractory elements compared to other iron meteorites. Description The IVB meteorites are composed of meteoric iron (kamacite, taenite and tetrataenite). The chemical composition is low in volatile elements and high in nickel and refractory elements. Although most IVB meteorites are ataxites (\\"without structure\\"), they do show microscopic Widmanst√§tten patterns. The lamellae are smaller than 20¬µm wide and lie in a matrix of plessite. The Tlacotepec meteorite is an octahedrite, making a notable exception, as most IVBs are ataxites. Classification Iron meteorites were originally divided into four groups designated by Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV). When more chemical data became available some groups were split. Group IV was split into IVA and IVB meteorites. The chemical classification is based on diagrams that plot nickel content against different trace elements (e.g. gallium, germanium and iridium). The different iron meteorite groups appear as data point clusters. Parent body IVB meteorites formed the core of a parent body that was later destroyed, some of the fragments falling on Earth as meteorites. Modeling the IVB parent body has to take into account the extreme chemical composition, especially the depletion of volatile elements (gallium, germanium) and the enrichment in refractory elements (iridium) compared to other iron meteorites. The history of the parent body has been reconstructed in detail. The IVB parent body will have formed from material that condensed at the highest temperatures while the solar nebula cooled off. The enrichment in refractory elements was caused by less than 10% of the condensible material going into the parent body. Thermal models suggest that the IVB parent body formed 0.3millionyears after the formation of the calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions, and at a distance from the sun of 0.9Astronomical units. Differentiation of the planet body into a core and mantle was most likely driven by the heat produced by the decay of 26Al and 60Fe. The high nickel concentrations were caused by oxidizing physical conditions. The chemical variation of IVB specimens can be explained as different stages of the fractional crystallization of the convecting core of the parent body. The exact size of the parent body is still debated. Modelling of cooling rates suggest that it had a 140¬±30km radius with a 70¬±15km radius core. The fast cooling rates are explained by a grazing-shot collision of the parent body with a larger asteroid. This removed the mantle from the parent body, leaving the shattered iron core behind to rapidly cool. Notable specimens The Hoba meteorite is the largest meteorite specimen ever found. As of December 2012, 14 specimens of IVB meteorites are known. A notable specimen is the Hoba meteorite, the largest known intact meteorite. There has never been an observed fall of an IVB meteorite.

He is known for his wooded landscapes with figures representing mythological or biblical stories or pastoral scenes. His work was only rediscovered in the mid-20th century. The discovery of additional signed works has made it possible to better understand the artist's style. As a result, there have been more attributions to him of works, which had previously been attributed to other painters with which he shared a similar approach to landscape painting such as Jan Brueghel the Younger.Jasper van der Lanen, Diana and her nymphs hunting at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Buenos Aires) Life Landscape with travellers in a forest Very little is known about the life of Jasper van der Lanen. He was registered as a pupil of the obscure painter Nicolaas Geerts in the guild year 1607 and became master of the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke in the guild year 1615.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde, listing archives from 1453-1615, Antwerp, 1864, pp. 445 and 513 In 1624 he married Elisabeth Rombouts. Abraham Govaerts acted as one of the witnesses at the wedding. Like van der Lanen, Abraham Govaerts was a young landscape painter and the two men were close friends. After the premature death of Abraham Govaerts on 9 September 1626, van der Lanen was one of the artists who were tasked with completing the works left unfinished by Govaerts. The other artists were Alexander Keirincx, Jasper (or Kasper) Adriaenssens, Nicolaes Aertsens, Antoon Bellieur, Peter Meulevelt and Jan Viers.Abraham Govaerts and Sebastiaen Vrancx, An elegant couple strolling through the forest at Gallerie Lowet de Wotrenge The time of death of van der Lanen is not known with certainty but it is believed he died in Antwerp sometime between 1626 and 1644. Works Three angels appearing to Abraham Jasper van der Lanen was a specialist landscape painter. He is known for his wooded landscapes with figures representing mythological or biblical stories or pastoral scenes. His work was only rediscovered in the mid-20th century. The discovery of additional signed works has made it possible to better understand the artist's style. As a result, there have been more attributions to him of works, which had previously been attributed to other painters with which he shared a similar approach to landscape painting such as Jan Brueghel the Younger. Jasper van der Lanen was working in a style that was similar to that of the contemporary Antwerp landscape artist Abraham Govaerts, with whom he was friends. His paintings share motifs and composition patterns with Govaerts work. Govaerts continued and developed further on the 16th- century landscape formula that divided space into receding planes, distinguished by color: earth tones and ochres for the first plane, various tones of green for the middle ground and blue tones for the last, distant plane. They further used devices to allow the viewer to penetrate the landscape from the foreground into the distance, thus created a dynamic landscape composition. Van der Lanen distinguished himself from Govaerts by reserving more space for the figures in the foreground, treating the props of his landscapes, such as the trunks of trees or clusters of yellowing with more detail, and painting reflections on the water and leaves with distinctly outlined edges.Jasper van der Lanen, Landscape with travellers in a forest at the National Museum Krak√≥w Typical hallmarks of van der Lanen's style are the clear diagonal perforations and the frequent use of broken tree trunks in the foreground. As was common in Antwerp artistic practice of the time, van der Lanen collaborated with specialist figure painters who added the figures to his landscapes. The painter Frans Francken the Younger often added the staffage in his works as did Hans III Jordaens. In some cases more than two artists worked on the same composition as in the case of The Four Elements, in which van der Lanen painted the landscape, Frans Francken the Younger added some figures and Jan Brueghel the Younger filled in the animals, the flowers and the plants on the right as well as the figures in the middle distance.Jan Brueghel (II), Frans Francken (II), Jasper van der Lanen (attributed), The Four Elements at Christie's References External links * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:Artists from Antwerp Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Jasper van der Lanen"},{"id":"37956855","text":"Lajos Vir√°g (born June 27, 1977 in Eger) is an amateur Hungarian Greco-Roman wrestler, who played for the men's heavyweight category.

Brahms is reported to have destroyed many of his works that did not meet his own high standards. This piano trio may be one of the exceptions to have survived. Background Discovery and publication The trio first came to light in 1924 when it was discovered amongst papers musicologist Ernst B√ºcken had inherited from the Bonn-based musical collector Erich Preiger. Despite the fact that the manuscript lacked a title page and was in the hand of an unknown copyist rather than Brahms' own handwriting, B√ºcken believed the work was genuine based both on perceived stylistic similarities between the newly discovered work and the Piano Trio No. 1 in B major, Op. 8 and the fact that it was known from a letter to Schumann that prior to the publication of the B major trio he had composed several others. The trio was published by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in 1938, in an edition edited by both B√ºcken and Karl Hasse. The original manuscript on which it was based disappeared shortly after publication. Authorship B√ºcken's attribution of the trio to Brahms was challenged a year after publication in an article by Richard Fellinger, who while supporting the attribution brought up the possibility that the trio, which was apparently written in the 1850s, may have been composed by a friend of Brahms, Albert Dietrich. McClelland notes that while most recent scholarship argues that Brahms did not compose this trio, few alternatives have been offered other than Dietrich. Christiansen, in his article, notes that while some portions of the trio sound like the work of Brahms, especially the opening theme of the trio portion of the second movement, other portions evoke Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann and even Dvo≈ô√°k and concludes that the trio may be the work either of Brahms at an early stage of his development, or by a talented composer, moving in similar circles to Brahms, who never rose to prominence. Stephen Schafer in his notes to the recording by the Macquarie Trio echoes this latter comment, adding that in his view some portions of the trio have resemblances to the style of Mendelssohn. Structure The trio is in four movements: The first movement, in sonata form, begins with a quiet, broad melody shared between piano and cello, building from the low register in a manner comparable to the opening of Op. 8, which eventually leads to a more extroverted second theme. The second movement is a rousing scherzo in F minor, similarly building from a quiet, low-register beginning; this contrasts with the gentle trio in B major (major-mode IV in relation to F minor). The return of the scherzo builds as before to a turbulent, galloping climax and finishes abruptly with no added coda. The D major Lento begins with a chordal passage on piano, which is then turned into a string duo with piano in the middle of the texture; the second thematic idea resembles a funeral march in B minor. The final movement opens with a rapid, chromatically descending theme with a vigorous drive; these characteristics also inflect the quietly joyful second theme.

This method uses an analyte affinity (either through antigens or antibodies) isolation to extract targeted molecules and internal standards from biological fluid in preparation for matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). This method allows for \\"top down\\" and \\"bottom up\\" analysis. This sensitive method allows for a new and improved process for detecting multiple antigens and antibodies in a single assay. This assay is also capable of distinguishing mass shifted forms of the same molecule via a panantibody, as well as distinguish point mutations in proteins. Each specific form is detected uniquely based on their characteristic molecular mass. MSIA has dual specificity because of the antibody-antigen reaction coupled with the power of a mass spectrometer. There are various other immunoassy techniques that have been used previously such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA and ELISA). These techniques are extremely sensitive however, there are many limitations to these methods. For example, quantification for ELISA and EIA require several hours because the binding has to reach equilibrium. RIA's disadvantage is that you need radioactive particles which are universally known to be carcinogens. The creation of MSIA fulfilled the need to determine the presence of one or more antigens in a specimen as well as the quantification of those said species.  History  This assay was patented in 2006 by Randall Nelson, Peter Williams and Jennifer Reeve Krone. The idea first came about with the development of ELISA and RIA. An earlier patent method suggested tagging antigens or antibodies with stable isotopes or long- lived radioactive elements . But limitations to both methods called for a better detection methods of a protein or proteins. The invention combines antigen-antibody binding with a mass spectrometer which aids in identifying qualitatively and quantifying analytes respectively. Mass spectrum generated using mass spectrometric immunoassay An early MSIA experiment was done on a venom laced human blood sample for the Antigen myotoxin. The experiment was successful in that the mass spectrum resulting from the analysis showed a distinct response for myotoxin at the molecular weight corresponding to 4,822 Da (a). The m/z ratio at 5,242 Da (b) is the molecular weight of the modified variant H-myotoxina, used as an internal reference species. The figure of the mass spectrum is shown below. Methodology 338x338pxAn illustration of the MSIA procedure is depicted in the figure to the right. Analytes in a biological liquid sample are collected from solution by using a MSIA tip (also known as MSIA microcolumns) that contains a derivatized affinity frit. Biological samples contain various proteins that span a wide dynamic range so purification is needed to minimize the complex matrix and maximize mass spectrometry sensitivity. the MSIA tip serves as a place to purify these samples by immobilizing the analyte with high selectivity and specificity. Analytes are bound to the frit based on their affinities and all other nonspecific molecules are rinsed away. The specific targets are then eluted on to a mass spectrometer target plate with a MALDI matrix. However, proteins may be digested prior to ms analysis. A MALDI-TOF-MS later follows and targeted analytes are detected based on their m/z values. This method is qualitative, but the addition of mass shifted variants of the analyte for use as an internal standard makes this method useful for quantitative analysis. Pipetor tips, which have been termed MSIA tips or affinity pipette tips play a key role in the process of detecting analytes within biological samples. MSIA tips typically contain porous solid support which has derivatized antigens or antibodies covalently attached. Different analytes have different affinity for the tips so it is necessary to derivatize MSIA tips based on the analyte of interest. The main use of these tips are to flow samples through and the analytes affinity for the bound antigen/antibody allows for the capture of analyte. Non specifically bound compounds are rinsed out of the MSIA tips. The process can be simplified into 6 simple steps which Thermo termed the \\"work flow\\". #Gather Sample #Load Affinity Ligand #Purify Target Analyte #Elute Target Analyte #Pre-MS Sampling Process #MS Analysis Many \\"work flows\\" are commercially available for purchase. Applications MSIA is a method that can be used as an assay for a variety of different molecules such as proteins, hormones, drugs, toxins, and various pathogens found in biological fluids (Human and animal plasma, saliva, urine, tears etc.). MSIA has also been applied to clinical samples and have been proven to be a unique assay for clinically relevant proteins. Successfully assaying toxins, drugs and other pathogens are important to the environment as well as the human body. MSIA can be used for a range of biomedical and environmental applications. An important application of mass spectrometric immunoassy is that it can be used as a rapid, sensitive and accurate screening of apolipoproteins and mutations of them. Apolipoproteins represent a groups of proteins with many functions such as transport and clearance as well as enzyme activation. Recent studies have claimed that mutations in apopliproteins result in, or assist in the progression of various associated diseases including amyloidosis, amyloid cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer's disease, hypertriglyceridemic, lowered cholesterol, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis to name a few. Nelson and colleagues did a study using MSIA to characterize and isolate apolipoproteins species.  Benefits  There are many benefits to using a mass spectrometric immunoassay. Most importantly, the assay is extremely fast and the data are reproducible, and automated. They are sensitive, precise and allows for absolute quantification. Analytes can be detected to low detection limits (as low as picomolar) and the assay covers a wide dynamic range.

The movie is about love between a man and a woman, dreams that can come true and a father's extreme love for his son. The talented Tan Sri P. Ramlee plays the adult father character, Hassan as well as the spoilt son, Sazali Hassan. Plot Hassan is an orphan who works with a rich family. The rich man has two children, Mansor (a boy)) and Mahani (a girl). Hassan developed an interest in music to the point that he is willing to spend whatever money he has earned to buy a violin. Once Hassan purchases the violin, he starts studying music from a violin teacher. Hassan's friendship with Mansor and Mahani is close. As all of three of them reaches adulthood, Mansor went to Singapore to study while Mahani was to be married to her father's choice. Hassan, who is in love with Mahani, cannot accept the marriage arrangement and decides to flee to Singapore. Mahani, who also loves Hassan follows him to Singapore. Both of them take a train ride to Singapore and meet up with Mansor at the train station. Mansor was surprised to his sister, Mahani and realised that Mahani has left their family behind to be with Hassan. Hassan explains the situation to Mansor and Mansor accepts that Hassan and Mahani really love each other. Mahani and Hassan marries with Mansor's consent. Mansor also marries a girl named Rokiah. After that Hassan continues his interest in music and becomes a famous musician. While Mansor, Rokiah, Hassan, Mahani and a few other guests were listening to Hassan's new single, Mahani collapses from a terrible headache. Mansor calls a doctor and the doctor attends to Mahani. The doctor then informed Hassan that Mahani is pregnant with their first child. Hassan was delighted and even then, Hassan felt that the unborn baby will be a baby boy. During her pregnancy, Mahani began to feel that she is going to die. Mahani decides to approach Hassan in a soft manner and made Hassan promise to take care of their unborn child citing that no one except Hassan must take care of the child. Hassan promises he will and even composes a song titled \\"Anakku Sazali\\" for his unborn son. While Hassan sings the song to Mahani, Mahani starts having a terrible headache and goes into labour. After delivering the baby, Hassan was informed by the doctor that Mahani gave birth to a baby boy. Hassan is happy and starts inquiring about Mahani. This is when the doctor informs Hassan that Mahani has died while giving birth to their son. Hassan is devastated. Hassan starts caring for his son, whom he named Sazali, in an adoring manner. Hassan even sings the song \\"Anakku Sazali\\" every time his baby boy sleeps. During a period of time caring for Sazali, Hassan visits Mansor to see his newborn baby girl, Rokiah. Hassan makes a promise to Mansor that when Sazali grows up, Hassan will make sure Sazali marries Mansor's daughter. During this time, Mansor's wife, also named Rokiah, notices that Hassan's health is declining. Upon inquiring, Hassan reveals that during the day, he is happy with Sazali's laughter and character but when night time arrives, Hassan constantly remembers his wife and misses her terribly. Rokiah encourages Hassan to get married but Hassan refuses. Hassan brushes off Rokiah's inquiry and states that the reason he came to Mansor's house is to see his future daughter in law. Soon, Sazali and Rokiah are little kids. They start playing together. During this time, Sazali's pampered attitude is apparent. While they are playing at the seaside, little Rokiah is building a castle. Little Sazali decides to destroy the castle as little Rokiah tells him that the castle is a symbol of love. Little Rokiah runs to Hassan and complaints to him that little Sazali has purposely destroyed her castle. When inquired by Hassan, little Sazali starts lying and says that he accidentally trips and fell on the castle. During night time as Hassan practices the violin, little Rokiah inquired about her box that was missing. As Rokiah's mother, Hassan and Rokiah start searching for the box, Hassan finally found it hidden among some books on a shelf. Hassan covers for Sazali and pretends to say he found Rokiah's box behind a cushion. After Rokiah's mother and Rokiah leaves the living room, Hassan confronts Sazali about the box. Sazali at first denied that he stole the box. Sazali then said that he hid the box because he loved Rokiah and his only mistake was lying to Hassan. Hassan was called to school because of Sazali's declining attitude. The teachers have given up on Sazali. Mansor approached Hassan and told Hassan that his love for Sazali is getting out of hand and Hassan needs to punish Sazali to ensure that he grows up to be a good boy. Hassan, however, feels that it is not right and Sazali should only be scolded lovingly instead of harshly. Hassan found out that Sazali had missed school and was wondering where he is. Sazali is seen to be in town. He starts stealing fruits from vendors and even breaks a jewellery shop window and steals the jewellery on display. Sazali, however, is caught by the shop owner and taken to Hassan to seek compensation. However, Hassan is not at home and Sazali steals his father's money and gives it to the shop owner. As Hassan returns home, the maid informs Hassan that Sazali was seen giving money to a few people who came to the house. Hassan then approaches Sazali and asked him about school. Sazali lies to his father with smart answers. To cover himself, Sazali said that when he was walking in town, he saw a house burning. He gave them money because he pitied them. Hassan, who believes Sazali's lies, shows him the house safe and gives Sazali a key to keep so that he can always help people whenever people come. Sazali, who knows that his father believes him no matter what, starts spending the money and informs his friends that he is rich and when he wants, his father will give him money because his father loves him too much. Sazali is now all grown up and a leader of the most wanted gangster in Singapore. It is Sazali's birthday and a party was held in Hassan's house for Sazali. Hassan entertains the crowd by playing the violin. Soon after that, Hassan announces that Rokiah will be singing a song for Sazali. After the rendition, the party ends and Sazali offers to send Rokiah and her parents home since Hassan had given Sazali a car for his birthday. A few days later, Rokiah calls Hassan and informs him that she urgently needs to speak to him. Rokiah arranges a meeting with Hassan at her house since her parents, Mansor and Rokiah, will be attending an evening function. Once Hassan reaches Mansor's house, Rokiah informs Hassan that during a boat ride with Sazali, the boat had stopped in the middle of sea. Sazali had then made his move on Rokiah and deflowered her. According to Rokiah, now that she is pregnant with Sazali's child, Sazali refuses to marry her. This angers Hassan. Hassan waits for Sazali to return home. Hassan then approaches Sazali about not marrying Rokiah since she is pregnant. According to Sazali, he will not marry her as Rokiah is trying to put the blame on him and that the child that Rokiah is carrying is not his. Hassan gets angry and gives Sazali an ultimatum to either marry Rokiah or leave the house. Sazali refuses to marry Rokiah. This angers Hassan even more and Hassan slaps Sazali. As Hassan reaches for his cane to whack Sazali even more, Sazali stops his father arrogantly and tells Hassan that if he had done this before, Sazali would not turn out this way. Sazali says that his father's love for him is the reason he became a leader of a group of gangsters. Sazali then leaves Hassan's house. Hassan is devastated. Sazali is planning a robbery of a jewellery shop with his gang. Sazali plans to become the leading gangster in Singapore. During this discussion, another gangster leader walks into Sazali's lair and threatens Sazali to leave the particular area within two days. If Sazali does not adhere to his advice, he will make sure Sazali does not live to see another day. Sazali, in return, ambushes the gang leader and gives him an ultimatum of leaving by the next morning. If the gang leader does not adhere to Sazali's warning, Sazali will make sure he will never live to see another day. The gang leader agrees. Sazali and his gang arrive at the jewellery shop and apprehended the guard on duty. Unknown to Sazali, an eyewitness saw the robbery in progress and called the police. The police arrived in time to chase Sazali and his gang. A gun fight ensued. However, Sazali managed to escape. Due to this, Sazali made front page of the newspaper. As Hassan was reading the morning paper, Hassan saw his son on the front page and was extremely sad to see his one and only beloved son become a fugitive. At the same time, Hassan went to visit Mansor only to find out that Rokiah had died in an accident. Hassan knew immediately that Rokiah had killed herself and he could not bring himself to tell Mansor the truth about Sazali's action that inconvenienced Rokiah to the point she had to kill herself. Hassan was feeling sad when he heard constant knocking on his front door. As he opens the door, he was surprised to see his son, Sazali. Sazali wanted to hide out in Hassan's house until the police stopped looking for him. Hassan half- heartedly agrees. Sazali then informs Hassan that he is hungry as he hasn't eaten since he was chased by the police. Hassan tells Sazali to wash himself up and he will prepare some food for Sazali to eat. Hassan brings food for Sazali and Sazali eats it up quickly. Before Sazali retires for bed, Sazali turns on his father's recording of \\"Anakku Sazali\\" and goes to sleep. Hassan, who is sitting in the living room, starts looking at his wife's picture and starts to think of all the things that have happened. Hassan realises, even though it was hard to do, that the best course of action is to call the police. After contemplating a few times, Hassan picks up the phone and calls the police. Sazali, who is sleeping, wakes up suddenly to realise that the police is in his room. The police takes Sazali away and Sazali quietly follows. Hassan looks at his wife's picture, and asks for her forgiveness. Cast * P.

Its plot follows a man who becomes jealous of the imagined affairs of his wife and kills everyone she meets, only for them to come back as zombies.  Plot  Tom Russo, a paranoid airplane mechanic struggling to make ends meet, becomes convinced his wife, Leeza, is cheating on him with various men after he finds and reads what he assumes is Leeza's diary. While Leeza is out grocery shopping one afternoon, Tom's friend Ben (who Tom suspects is one of the men Leeza is having an affair with) drops by with his girlfriend Angel. Tom decapitates Angel, beats Ben to death with her head, and buries the couple's remains. The next day, Tom lures back an electrician who he believes had sex with Leeza and scalps him by lifting the man into a ceiling fan that has had machetes attached to the blades. Tom sends Leeza to her mother's house and kills three others (a TV repairman, a courier, and a gardener) she wrote about sleeping with. The death of the courier is witnessed by Mrs. Palmer, the neighborhood busybody, so Tom rips her mandible out with a claw hammer. At the offices of Romping Romance Magazine, Leeza shows her \\"diary\\" off, and reveals the adulterous anecdotes in it are just works of fiction. Leeza returns home to show Tom the cheque she received for her stories, just as Tom's victims return as zombies to avenge their own deaths. The ghouls initially want Tom, but offer to spare him if he kills Leeza (who they conclude is the one truly responsible for what happened to them). Tom refuses this bargain, and commits suicide by slitting his own throat with a hacksaw. The zombies deem this turn of events acceptable, exit the house, and leap into a pit that appears in the backyard. Leeza tries to leave as well, but as soon she opens the front door, she is attacked by an undead Tom.

He became a well-known character actor in German cinema of the 1930s and 1940s, often in eccentric or villanous roles. Among his roles were Mayer Amschel Rothschild in the anti-semitic Nazi film The Rothschilds (1940) and a stuffy school teacher in Die Feuerzangenbowle (1944) with Heinz R√ºhmann, widely regarded as a film classic in Germany. After World War II he appeared in Carol Reed's British thriller The Third Man (1949), he played Orson Welles' sinister physician in a supporting role. In 1955 Ponto won a \\"Film Award in Silver\\" as the \\"Best male actor in a Supporting role\\" for Himmel ohne Sterne (1955).IMDb Awards for \\"Himmel ohne Sterne\\" He worked as an actor until shortly before his death. As a synchronisation actor, Ponto dubbed English actors like Lionel Barrymore, Charles Laughton and Charley Grapewin in a number of films between the mid 1930s and early 1950s.Erich Ponto at the Synchrondatenbank (German)  Personal life  In 1916 he married Tony Kresse, they had two children. Ponto also worked as an acting teacher, among his students was Gert Fr√∂be of Goldfinger fame.Gert Fr√∂be: Hollywood-Star aus Zwickau (German) Ponto's final film was Der Stern von Afrika, released in the year of his death. He died at the age of 72 after a long cancer illness. Erich Ponto was the uncle of Dresdner Bank general director J√ºrgen Ponto, who was murdered by members of the communist RAF in 1977.F√ºnf Sch√ºsse im eigenen Haus, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung (German)  Selected filmography  * Der Geiger von Meissen (1921) * Woman in the Jungle (1931) - Joyce * The Man Who Murdered (1931) - Boucher * Love, Death and the Devil (1934) - The Old Man * Santa Joana D'Arc (1935) - Lord Talbot * The King's Prisoner (1935) - Friseur * The Last Four on Santa Cruz (1936) - Alexander Ghazaroff * Schlu√üakkord (1936) - Jury President * The Hound of the Baskervilles (1937) - Stapleton * Tango Notturno (1937) - Poor Man * The Mystery of Betty Bonn (1938) - Capitain Spurling * By a Silken Thread (1938) - Theodor Kalbach * The Four Companions (1938) - Alfred Hintze * Dreizehn Mann und eine Kanone (1938) * Hallo Janine (1939) - Mr. Pamion * Wibbel the Tailor (1939) - Schneider Anton Wibbel * In letzter Minute (1939) - Alexander Piepenbrink * The Fire Devil (1940) - Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte * Die Rothschilds (1940) - Mayer Amschel Rothschild * Aus erster Ehe (1940) - Professor Skutor * Wie konntest Du, Veronika!

It was the earliest of the line of 6 calcalkalic volcanoes, the largest of which is Mount Pirongia (the others are at Kakepuku, Te Kawa, Tokanui, Waikeria and probably Puketotara). Karioi forms a background to many parts of Raglan. Karioi was also a Highway Board area around the maunga from 1870 to 1889, when it was absorbed (with Whaingaroa Board area and formed into Karioi Riding) into Raglan County Council. In 1876 it had a population of 112 in 27 houses and in 1889 119 ratepayers, 80 of them absentees. Karioi is also a location on the Central Plateau (see articles on Mangamahu, North Island Main Trunk, Raetihi, Waiouru).  History and culture   Pre-European history  \\"Viewed from the Northhead, the Karioi mountain presents itself in its full beauty as a mighty corner-buttress jutting far into the sea on the Southside of the harbour. It is a trachyte-stock like Pirongia, 2372 feet high, wood-grown from foot to top, its declivities furrowed by ravines, and with a broad, serrated top.\\" Ferdinand von Hochstetter 1867. Many iwi whakapapa back to Karioi, which features in several MƒÅori legends. One says that, a long time ago, Karewa was the husband of Karioi, but he flirted with her sister, Pirongia, and was cast into the sea as the offshore rock named by Captain James Cook as Gannet Island. The profile of Karioi from Raglan is likened to a 'Sleeping Lady' (Wahine Moe).  European settlement  Raglan County Hills and Sea 1876‚Äì1976 (page 17) describes the start of European history - ‚ÄúThe sails of Abel Tasman's two ships were seen not long before noon on 28 December 1642. . .Tasman's own account of the incident. . . \\"on the 28th in the morning, at daybreak, set sail again, shaped our course east in order to ascertain whether the aforementioned land which we had seen in 40 degrees, extends still further northward or whether it falls away to eastward. At noon saw a high mountain east by north of us.\\" This was Karioi. \\"First took it to be an island,\\" . . . but afterwards saw that it was an extended coast. We were about 4 miles from shore\\" . . . The date was 11 January 1770. Cook . . . wrote in his journal, \\"found ourselves between 2 and 3 leagues from the land which was of moderate height and cloathed with wood and verdure. At 7 o'clock steered south-by-east and afterwards saw the land lying in that direction.\\" He did not see the harbour of Whaingaroa but could not miss Karioi Mountain. \\"At 9 was abreast of a point of land which rises sloaping from the sea to a considerable height. It lies in the latitude 37 degrees 43 minutes south. I named it Woody Head. South-west-a-half-west 11 miles from the head is a very small island which we named Gannet Island on account of the great number of these birds we saw upon it. At noon a high craggy point bore east-north east one and a half leagues: this point I have named Albatross Point.‚Äú \\\\- page 61 - ‚ÄúRepresentative Government . . . did not become effective until early in 1854. One of its first tasks was to find land for the steadily growing number of prospective settlers reaching these shores . . . The astute Donald McLean, whom Governor Grey had appointed Chief Land Purchase Commissioner in 1853, began negotiations with the west coast tribes almost immediately. In the 8 months from January to August, 1854, he arranged the purchase of more than 40,000 acres of native land in the present County area. . . On 11 April McLean paid 50 golden sovereigns as a deposit on . . . the Wharauroa Block . . . On the day following the first payment on Wharauroa, McLean handed over a similar sum in gold to \\"the chiefs and people of Whaingaroa\\" as a deposit on the Karioi Block. This area of about 12,000 acres embraced the whole of Karioi Mountain. It extended down the coast from the mouth of the Wainui Stream (just inside South Head) to the Ruapuke Stream. Here the boundary ran NE in a straight line toward Te Mata where it met the Opotoru Stream and followed it northward for about 3 miles. Thence it ran west and north to the starting point near the mouth of the harbour. A reserve of 600 acres was set apart for the former Maori owners. 18 months later, on 5 November 1855 (the day on which the last of the ¬£575 purchase money was paid over) 65 of them, including about a dozen boys, signed the deed or affixed their marks in the presence of John Rogan and James Wallis. \\"These lands,\\" read the document in part, \\"we have now entirely given up to Victoria the Queen of England in the broad light of this day and for ever; with its creeks, its rivers, its streams, its timber and stones.\\" ‚ÄúThe price paid for the Karioi Block (which amounted to 11¬Ωd an acre) was in keeping with the Government's view of native land values in the middle '50s, particularly in this instance, when the extent of mountainous terrain was taken into account. From the heavily forested summit of Karioi Mountain, steep-sided ridges and ravines descended on both seaward and landward sides. When Rogan took over land negotiations in the Whaingaroa and Aotea districts in 1855, McLean told him: \\"You cannot do wrong in acquiring land at prices varying from 6d to 1/6 per acre in a part of the country that promises to become such a valuable appendage to the Crown territory.\\" [However, an alternative view says Karioi was given to the Crown in 1855.] page 127 - ‚ÄúThe first block in the county, opened in 1878, for settlement under the [Homestead] scheme, was in the Karioi district. It was soon taken up, and the council, quick to see the advantages of bringing in more people, urged the Waste Lands Board to make other blocks available. . . The Waste Lands Board was also asked to provide the means to make roads to the Homestead selections and, by 1883, this work was under way. The system did much to open up the district‚Äù. \\\\- page 177 - ‚Äúafter the war, the two Jackson brothers . . . bulldozed out a road. With Mr J. Forbes of Whale Bay, as overseer, and two Maori men and a staunch Maori woman as labourers, they contracted to do work on the road for the county council. By mid-1953 the [Whaanga] road was almost completed, though metalling was not done for 2 years.‚Äù Although the on-line history of the summit trig mark only dates back to 1995, it was first surveyed by Laurence Cussen, probably not long after 1876. Many timber mills were set up around Karioi e.g. page 230 ‚ÄúThe Raglan Sawmilling Co, a public concern, was formed in 1919 to mill timber on Mt Karioi, said to contain on its eastern slopes some of the finest stands of rimu in the country . . . In 1928, a fire swept through Te Hutewai, the flames destroying vegetation ‚Äî and a sawmill ‚Äî along the entire strip of land between Ruapuke and Raglan. The aftermath of charred stumps and blackened earth may well have symbolised the death of the timber industry in Raglan. The last mills ‚Äî at Karioi . . . closed in the late 1930s‚Äù. The route of Whaanga Rd, around the coast side of Karioi, was first considered for a road in 1886. It was bulldozed through in 1953.  Modern history  Karioi has been administered by the Department of Conservation (DOC) as part of Pirongia Forest Park since it took over from the Forest Service in 1987.  Marae  The nearest marae to Mt. Karioi is PoihƒÅkena, of Tainui a Whiro, on the edge of Raglan. About the same distance to the south is M≈çtakotako marae of NgƒÅti Whakamarurangi. Tirohia Marae on the central plateau is a traditional meeting ground of the NgƒÅti Rangi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Hƒ´oi.  Geology  Geology map of Karioi, Pirongia, Kakepuku and Te Kawa Karioi is an extinct late Pliocene, low angle cone or shield volcano of the Alexandra Volcanic Group. It is the oldest and westernmost of the Alexandra lineament of volcanoes. Two million years ago Karioi was probably an ash cone, maybe double and at least 100 m higher than the present 756 m. It consists largely of basalt with andesite dikes, which mainly form the ridges. They pushed their way through the older limestones, mudstones, etc. about 2.4 million years ago. The main chemicals are silica (47-60%) and alumina (12-20%)  Te Toto Gorge  Te Toto Gorge from lookout platform 15 lava flows make up the 150 m cliffs of the Gorge showing many large augite crystals (phenocrysts) up to 15 mm. Columnar basalt rests on lapilli tuffs. Mainly on the north side of the gorge are remnants of MƒÅori stone gardens. There is a steep unmarked track into the Gorge off the road to Raglan a few metres from the car park. A route also exists around the foot of the cliff south from the Gorge, though it is not publicised due to a rock fall risk. The threatened plants Hebe speciosa and Cook's scurvy grass have been reintroduced to Te Toto Gorge.  Vegetation  Captain Cook named Karioi as Woody Head. The mountain is unique in being the most northerly on the west coast with a native rainforest sequence from sea level to montane flora. It is sustained by annual rainfall of over 1.5m. Whaingaroa's native vegetation used to consist of podocarp rainforest dominated by totara, matai, rimu, kahikatea, rata, black maire and tree ferns. In most of Whaingaroa it was largely cleared by felling and burning in the early 20th century, but remains on Karioi. Since the 1960s possums have killed many of the larger trees which had survived logging until the 1970s, their stark trunks remaining above the secondary growth. Karioi ridges from the summit Altitude and wind are the main influences on Karioi's plants. Along the main track the forest changes from kohekohe near Te Toto Gorge to tawa forest, to kamahi and tƒÅwheowheo towards the top, with a sequence of mƒÅhoe and rewarewa between the kohekohe and kamahi on the Ruapuke Rd side. Other species of note include miro, toro, horopito and neinei. Despite damage, distinct plant communities (tree fern, ridge, lowland, valley floor, boulder slope, coastal and montane exposed and sheltered) remain. The Botanical Society identified 127 indigenous species from forest above 300 m and 264 below that level, including chain fern, spring clubmoss (puakarimu), star fern, hen & chickens fern, hanging spleenwort, crown fern, thread fern, miniature tree fern (Blechnum fraseri), silver fern, mamaku, soft tree fern, golden tree fern, rough tree fern, strap fern, water fern, filmy fern, mangemange, ring fern, fragrant fern, shield fern, bracken, titipo, climbing shield fern, kidney fern, titoki, karapapa, makomako, rangiora, bindweed, putaputawƒìtƒÅ, clematis, twiggy coprosma, karaka, prickly mingimingi, grass tree, hƒ´nau, parataniwha, hangehange, kapuka, puka vine, hebe, pigeonwood, poroporo, kowhai, aka, perching lily, Easter orchid, blueberry, tree daisy, jasmine vine, kiekie, lemonwood, rice grasses, pepper tree, supplejack, gloxinia and hook grass. In autumn parts of Karioi are rich in fungi, including blue mushroom, red wax gill, Jews ear and many bracket fungi. Altitude affects many of Karioi's plants. Between 550-650m, the regular mist line, many species have either their upper or lower limit. The change occurs within 20 to 30 m and higher on ridges than in valleys. Mosses increase where growth is affected by cloud, leaf temperature, and transpiration. Nutrient uptake is hampered and the trees are stunted and gnarled. Kamahi is typical; its monopodial (single trunk) form changes to sympodial (low, gnarled with root-stocks supporting up to a dozen trunks) at higher altitudes. Cold air drainage on valley floors creates some of the conditions occurring in montane areas e.g., high relative humidity, low evaporative demand, and less sun. Wind, in the form of prevailing salt-laden sou‚Äôwesters off the sea, significantly affects what grows where. Species uncommon near the coast include tawa, northern rata, and rimu. Kiekie thrives in dense tangles in exposed positions and puriri and nikau palm are more common on the sea side. Tawa and rewarewa are more common on ridges. Although rata vines use a wide variety of hosts, pukatea is the most common. Pukatea grow mainly in valley floors, as do rata.  Birds  Since 2000 ground cover on Karioi has improved and tui, bellbird and pigeon are more prolific. Kaka are sometimes seen. The regeneration of bush on MƒÅori land around Karioi may account, in part, for the increase in birdlife. Shining cuckoos, grey warblers, tomtits and fantails can also often be heard and pest trapping near the cliffs aims to protect grey faced petrel burrows.  Bats (pekapeka-tou-poto)  The high pitched squeaks of long tailed bats have been detected around Karioi.  Lizards (moko)  3 species of native geckos have been seen on Karioi. Auckland green geckos (see also nautilus) were common on Karioi before possums arrived. Although brightly coloured and active during the day, they are very well camouflaged and hard to spot in the manuka and kanuka where they mainly live. forest geckos and Pacific geckos are usually on the ground and active at night. Karioi streams are clean enough to support fish such as these kokopu from Wainui Stream  Pest control  Even by the 1950s damage was obvious enough for a tourist guidebook to say, \\"Wild goats are doing considerable damage to the native flora.\\"Bradbury's Illustrated series 8th edition South Auckland 1951 page 124 Since a low point in the 1970s, DoC has done a lot to restore Karioi by periodically reducing numbers of introduced animals through eradication programmes. The aim is to assist native flora and fauna populations. Many tree species were threatened by a high goat population, such that saplings could only survive by growing on other trees as epiphytes above goat browsing level. Many New Zealand trees are well suited to this form of regeneration, as they drop aerial roots to the ground. Radio tagged 'Judas goats' have failed to locate any others. However, just as the trees threatened by goats were saved, other species came under threat from possums. Northern rata, tree daisy, kohekohe and kamahi trees are favourite foods of possums and many were killed by browsing. Most areas of bush have possum bait stations (linked by pink-waymarked tracks). They didn't achieve residual trap catch rates (RTC) below 5%, so most of Karioi now has aerial drops of 1080 poison at about 5 yearly intervals. The 2010 drop achieved a 1.06% RTC. By 2016 the level had risen to 10%, prompting another 1080 application in 2017.This November 2012 photo shows how well tree daisies have recovered and provoked much local interest in this 'new' phenomenon The interval was determined by monitoring of 96 kohekohe, 43 kamahi and 8 Hall's totara, which had been tagged and were assessed annually for change in foliage cover, possum browse and trunk use. The Karioi Biodiversity Restoration project is a community led project, run in partnership with A Rocha Aotearoa NZ, Te Whakaoranga O Karioi (translated as restoring Karioi to a healthy sustainable environment), DoC, local hapu and the Whaingaroa community. Trapping started in 2009 in the Upper Bryant Reserve with up to 60 volunteers maintaining around 150 rat, possum and stoat traps in 28 hectares of bush. By 2020 there were over 2,000 traps and 350 volunteers covering some . In the first 3 years 592 rats, 183 mice, 6 stoats, 26 possums and 13 hedgehogs were caught. 50 stoat traps were placed along the 5 km Te Toto Gorge to Ruapuke ridge track and had caught 54 stoats and 73 rats in 2017. Myrtle rust was found on some ramarama and rata in 2018, but has been controlled and is being monitored.  Walks  Beyond Whale Bay the road is unsealed and, after crossing Te Toto Gorge, there is a car park (bikes are better sheltered in the bush above the car park). A short walk down from the car park is a view of the 150 m high cliffs (see Geology above). Climbing up from the car park is a DOC track to the 756 m top of Karioi. The signposted times of 2 hours to the 706 m Lookout and 3 hours to the summit allow fit walkers time for admiring the views, but on a good day it is well worth taking at least that time. The track is clearly marked and clear on the ground, but gets progressively harder, including a ladder and 2 chains. About halfway up, just before the first chain and ladder, is a good view point. Other steps and chains would be useful, especially after wet weather, but there are plenty of tree roots to grasp hold of on the other shorter near vertical sections. In most weather ordinary stout shoes suffice with some care around the few boggy sections on the summit ridge. Climbing the chain from Te Toto to Karioi Lookout From the lookout there is a good view of Raglan, the Harbour and the coast north to the Waitakeres west of Auckland. If going on to the summit, there are similar, if not slightly better, views without the detour to the Lookout. The final few metres to the Summit involve an awkward drop back into the trees, a difficult traverse clambering over tree roots and a ladder to climb back up. The Summit is topped with a small radio relay station powered by solar panels, a helicopter pad and a wind generator. From the summit Ruapuke Beach can be seen, as well as Aotea and KƒÅwhia Harbours and Albatross Point beyond. 20 km out to sea it is possible to see 13 m high Karewa (Gannet Island) and east to Mount Pirongia, north east to Hamilton and Coromandel and north to Whaingaroa Harbour with Lake Waikare and the Bombay Hills beyond. On clear days Mount Taranaki is visible, about 160 km (100 miles) to the SSW. Raglan West and the Harbour entrance are hidden by the spur and better seen from the west end of the ridge. The alternative easier route to Karioi is from Ruapuke Rd. It has little exposure to heights and no chains. The car park is indicated by a signpost from Ruapuke Rd. The track uses a farm road for the first kilometre until the track is signposted up the hill alongside a fence on the right and a stile leads into the bush. The track is then clear on the ground and marked. Possum bait station tracks are marked with pink plastic waymarks. If you find you are following these on a less distinct track go back to look for the orange waymarks. There is also a poorly marked track into Te Toto Gorge (see above).  Tourism  The Raglan and Kawhia Districts 1915 guide said, ‚ÄúThe summit of this mountain (which rises to a height of 2420 feet above sea level) may be reached by a beautiful drive from Raglan through unrivalled scenery. On a clear day a magnificent view may be obtained‚Äù. A 1911 Gilmour Brothers postcard showed a picnic party at Te Toto Gorge. In 2007 DoC replaced its 1981 viewing platform at Te Toto Gorge with one giving better views; only slowly does tourism develop.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 16, 2012. An alternate cut of this episode was re-aired on December 23, 2012. It had a few minor changes, including insertion of the Plymptoons couch gag from \\"Beware My Cheating Bart\\" that was not included in the original airing. Also, the final Montgomery Burns Explains the \\"Fiscal Cliff\\" scene was cut from the original version shown so that the episode still has the same runtime. Plot During an event in downtown Springfield, Professor Frink demonstrates a new invention that he soon loses control of, resulting in the destruction of the Springfield Retirement Castle. This results in Grampa moving in with the Simpson family. Meanwhile, Homer discovers an app game called \\"Villageville\\" on his MyPad, which involves constructing a village. His immediate addiction to it causes him to ignore Santa's Little Helper and lead to the dog's sudden disappearance. After minutes of searching, they eventually find Santa's Little Helper hidden in a pantry shelf below the sink. Lisa and Bart realize Homer has not paid any attention to the dog all the time. When Homer states that he does not get along with Santa's Little Helper because he is not a \\"dog person\\", Grampa mentions about another dog named Bongo, which upsets Homer. It is revealed that Bongo was Homer's childhood dog and best friend (along with Harry Nilsson singing Me and My Arrow from the cartoon The Point, which the animation also imitates, with cross-hatch shading and a more angular style). Grampa soon reveals that during a kid's fundraiser Mr. Burns was hosting, Burns insulted Homer and Bongo attacked him in retaliation. Hugely upset, Burns demands that Grandpa turn Bongo over to him so that he can have the dog killed. To save Bongo's life, Grandpa sent him to a farm upstate run by a woman named Ms. Viola, but Homer was devastated, leaving Grandpa to suffer both his son's anger and Burns' making him take on a terrible job and awful wardrobe as punishment for not sacrificing Bingo. Back in the present, Homer has still resented Grampa to this day, realizing he will never see Bongo or that Bongo will never remember his old friend. Grampa then shows Homer a picture of an older Bongo resting on an old sweatshirt Homer gave to Bongo when the dog was left to Ms. Viola, proving that Bongo still remembers him. Homer tries to deny the truth but eventually bursts into tears when he realizes that Grandpa did something noble and suffered badly for it, and he immediately makes amends with his father and spends the following night sleeping on the couch with him and Santa's Little Helper, dreaming about himself walking with Santa's Little Helper alongside a younger Homer with Bongo, Burns with his dogs, and Krusty with a gorilla that was the predecessor of Mr. Teeny. At the end of the episode, Mr. Burns has a sad (for him) conversation with Smithers where they concede that Mitt Romney lost the 2012 Presidential election, and then explains the fiscal cliff in his own words. Production The episode was written by Carolyn Omine and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode was paired with the short, Montgomery Burns Explains the \\"Fiscal Cliff\\" which aired right after the episode ended and right before the closing credits. This short film was not included when the episode had a repeat airing one week later and has sometimes been edited out of airings in syndication due to it becoming outdated. Reception Ratings The episode was watched by a total of 3.77 million viewers, making it, at that point, the lowest-watched episode of the show. In part, this was due to pre- emption by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting memorial service, which aired live on most of the East Coast markets. The show still managed to be Fox's most watched show of the night. That night's new episodes of Family Guy and American Dad! episodes (\\"Jesus, Mary and Joseph!\\" and \\"Minstrel Krampus\\") were preempted and replaced with reruns of their respective shows (\\"Grumpy Old Man\\" and \\"Wheels and the Legman in: 'The Case of Grampa's Key'\\"). Fox decided to repeat \\"To Cur with Love\\" in the regular timeslot one week later replacing a repeat, while also putting the pre-empted episode of Family Guy and a new episode of American Dad! entitled \\"National Treasure 4: Baby Franny: She's Doing Well: The Hole Story\\", unrelated to \\"Minstrel Krampus\\", on the air. The repeat was watched by 4.89 million viewers with a 2.1 rating in the 18-49 demographic.

Biography  Emily Lyle grew up in Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire, Scotland. She studied English Language and Literature at the University of St Andrews (MA 1954), followed by an education course at the University of Glasgow (Diploma in Education, 1955). For six years she taught English in secondary schools in Britain and New Zealand before she was appointed as a Lecturer in English at Ripon College of Education in Yorkshire (1961‚Äì65). While employed as a Senior Lecturer in English at Neville‚Äôs Cross College in Durham (1965‚Äì68), she wrote her doctoral dissertation \\"A Study of Thomas the Rhymer and Tam Lin in Literature and Tradition\\" (1967) at the Institute of Folk-Life Studies at the University of Leeds. Moving away from the teaching of English literature, she soon established herself in the field of Scottish studies.  Academic career  In 1976-77, she went to Australia as a visiting Fellow at the Australian National University. There she collected oral material from those with Scottish connections, some of which is included in the CD ‚ÄúChokit on a Tattie‚Äù (focusing on children‚Äôs songs and rhymes), and in a forthcoming issue of the journal Tochter. In 1977, Lyle donated copies of her tape recordings to the National Library of Australia. The work she did as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute of Harvard University in 1974-75 gave her increased visibility as a ballad scholar and led to many more visits to Harvard, including an appointment at the Center for the Study of World Religions in 1995. She was appointed as a Research Fellow at the School of Scottish Studies of the University of Edinburgh from 1970 to 1995 and as a Lecturer from 1995 to 1998. In 1978 she was Visiting Professor of Folklore at the University of California at Los Angeles; from 1979-1982 she was a Visiting Lecturer in Folklife Studies at the University of Stirling from 1979 to 1982.

He was also Superintendent of the McLean Asylum near Boston, from 1837 to 1855. Early life Bell was born in Francestown, New Hampshire, son of state governor and two-term U.S. Senator Samuel Bell. With his younger brother John, Bell attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a year. He then entered Bowdoin College at age 12, and graduated in 1823. He moved to New York to study medicine under his older brother, John, and later received a medical degree from Dartmouth College in 1826. Because of his youth, he worked in New York in business until 1831, when he returned to Derry, New Hampshire, to establish his medical practice. Physician In the 1830s, Bell submitted essays for the Boyleston Prize offered by Harvard Medical School. In 1835, he won the prize with an essay on diet, and in 1836, he was one of three winners for his submission, \\"How Far are the Means of Exploring the Condition of the Internal Organs to be Considered Useful and Important in the Practice of Medicine?\\" In addition to his medical practice, he carried on the family tradition of serving in politics and public office. He was elected in New Hampshire as a state representative and served on the legislative committee to investigate the status of the insane in New Hampshire. He lobbied vigorously for a state institution. He succeeded when the state legislature authorized its construction in Concord in 1838, and it opened in 1842. He stayed politically active: campaigning for a seat in Massachusetts in 1852 and for governor in 1856, both were unsuccessful. Dr. Bell's efforts for a state mental institution in New Hampshire became known to the Trustees of McLean Asylum after the death of the then superintendent. In 1836, Bell went to Boston to meet several trustees, and the Board offered him the position. He accepted and began traveling to other asylums. He visited asylums in Worcester, Massachusetts, the Hartford Retreat in Connecticut, and the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum in New York. He assumed office at the McLean Asylum in February 1836. The McLean Asylum was the first mental hospital in Massachusetts and was established in 1818 as an affiliate of the Massachusetts General Hospital under Dr. Rufus Wyman (1818-1835). Wyman established a treatment program known as \\"Moral Treatment,\\" which had been instituted by the Quakers in England. Bell continued this treatment method. The establishment of the Worcester asylum under state auspices in 1833 diverted indigent patients from McLean, which allowed the staff there to treat more affluent patients and to provide patients with comforts including occupation and recreation. As the superintendent at McLean, Bell was interested in hospital ventilation, and in 1848 presented the annual address to the Massachusetts Medical Society on this subject. Bell served as a forensic examiner for the Massachusetts courts. In 1850, he became a member of the Executive Committee to advise the governor in cases of application for the pardon of criminals under sentence. In 1853, he was appointed to a Board of Commissioners to examine convicts in the penitentiary who presented symptoms of mental illness, and attributed cases of mental illness to masturbation.Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz (Ed.), Attitudes toward Sex in Antebellum America, 2006, Pg. 74. In the 1850s, Bell became interested in spiritualism. Twice he made presentations on this subject at the annual meetings of the AMSAII. He attributed his interest to scientific research but the lack of objective findings led him to abandon his interest. He continued to write papers about the architecture of asylums, statistics of mental hospitals, the use of restraints on patients, and aspects of medical jurisprudence. One of his papers described a new form of mania he had observed which was briefly termed Bell's mania but this later faded away. In 1844, the Trustees of the proposed Butler Asylum in Rhode Island asked the McLean Trustees to allow Bell to visit asylums in Europe, and then serve as a consultant to the new Butler Hospital. Bell was granted leave by the Board of Trustees of the McLean Asylum, and toured England and France. Upon his return, Bell was offered the superintendence position at Butler Asylum but declined and remained at McLean. Bell was a firm believer in the efficacy of moral treatment. He wrote to Dorothea Dix, \\"Each year ‚Ä¶ has served to diminish my confidence in an active medical treatment of almost every form of disease of the mind and to increase my reliance on moral means.\\" Bell was active in the AMSAII. He served as vice president (1850-1851) and as president (1851-1855). He served as president of the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1857. During his tenure at McLean, three of Bell's seven children died and his wife died in childbirth. He suffered bouts of pneumonia and hemoptysis. In 1856, he retired from McLean and set up a home in Charleston, South Carolina. When his successor at the McLean Asylum died a year later, the Trustees asked Bell to resume his position until a new superintendent was hired. He stayed for four months. With the advent of the U.S. Civil War, Bell applied for a commission as a surgeon in the U.S. Army and was assigned to the Eleventh Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers. He took part in the Battle of Bull Run in Virginia. He advanced to the post of Division Surgeon in the Eleventh Regiment under General Joseph Hooker. He became ill in February 1862 and died. Dr. Isaac Ray, one of the thirteen founders of the AMSAII, published \\"A Discourse on the Life and Character of Dr. Luther V. Bell,\\" which he read at the annual meeting in 1862.

The chapel is a popular tourist destination in Northwest Arkansas, as well as a widely used wedding ceremony location. Architecture Closeup view of the steel beams and glass panels that makeup the chapel The design recalls the Prairie School of architecture popularized by Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom Jones had apprenticed. Jones used 31 tons of steel and 4,460 square feet of glass to create a series of Gothic arches that run the length of the chapel. Though it looks like an open-air structure, the chapel is a glass-enclosed, air-conditioned space. Soon after completion the chapel was praised that it \\"quietly commands a dignity and presence uncommon among buildings of our era.\\"  About Mildred Borum Cooper  Mildred Borum Cooper, born and raised in Arkansas, spent much of her life in service to her people and community.

Traditionally the Chief Rabbi serves as the head of all British Jews as the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. He served as the Chief Rabbi of Ireland between 1985 and 1992. Early life and education Mirvis was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 1956, the son of Rabbi Dr. Lionel and Freida Mirvis. His father was the Rabbi of the Claremont and the Wynberg Hebrew Congregations in Cape Town. He also served as Rabbi in Benoni for a while and Ephraim attended local schools. Mirvis has written that his father preached against the apartheid system, and visited political prisoners held on Robben Island, while his mother was the principal of the Athlone teacher training college, which was then the country‚Äôs sole college for training black pre- school teachers. His grandfather, Lazar Mirvis, was a Jewish Minister in Johannesburg. Mirvis attended Herzlia High School in Cape Town from 1968 to 1973. After moving to Israel in 1973, Mirvis studied at Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh from 1973 to 1976 and Yeshivat Har Etzion, in the West Bank Israeli settlement of Alon Shvut,Jonathan Ofir, 'Zionists of the world (& co.) unite against Corbyn,' Mondoweiss 30 November 2019 from 1976 to 1978. He studied at Machon Ariel in Jerusalem from 1978 to 1980 and received his rabbinic ordination there. At the same time, Mirvis obtained a BA in Education and Classical Hebrew from the University of South Africa and received certification from Yaakov Herzog Teachers College as a high school teacher in Israel. Mirvis has a deep interest in chazanut and has studied voice and Jewish cantorial music in Jerusalem. He has also been certified as a shochet and mohel. He is a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.BBC Religion and Ethics, 30 August 2013 Career Rabbinical appointments In 1982, Mirvis was appointed Rabbi of Dublin's Adelaide Road Synagogue and Chief Rabbi of Ireland in 1985, serving at this post until 1992. From 1992 to 1996, he was the rabbi of the Western Marble Arch Synagogue in London, after the previous holder of the position, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, became Chief Rabbi in 1991. In May 1996, Mirvis was appointed rabbi at the Finchley United Synagogue, also known as Kinloss, in London. Here he founded and directed the community-based, adult education programme, the Kinloss Learning Centre, which has drawn hundreds of participants on a weekly basis since 2003 and has served as an educational model emulated by other communities. Mirvis is the founder rabbi and honorary principal of Morasha Jewish Primary School and founder and President of the Kinloss Community Kollel. Other positions held While living in Ireland, Mirvis was Chairman of the Board of Governors of Stratford Jewish Schools, in Dublin, from 1984 to 1992. Mirvis has been a member of the Steering Committee of the Conference of European Rabbis since 1986 and has served as its Associate President since 2013. In 1992, he arranged and hosted the Biennial Conference of European Rabbis at the Western Marble Arch Synagogue and in 2001, he led the first group visit by United Synagogue rabbis to the United States. Mirvis has been the Religious Advisor to the Jewish Marriage Council since 1997. He has served on the Council of the London School of Jewish Studies, on the Steering Committee of the Encounter Conference and the Singer‚Äôs Prayer Book Publications Committee. He was Chairman of the Rabbinical Council of the United Synagogue from 1999 to 2002. As the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations, he is also the President of the London School of Jewish Studies. Interfaith collaboration Mirvis served as the President of the Irish Council of Christians and Jews (CCJ) from 1985 to 1992. He has participated in dialogue with Church leaders in the UK at Windsor Castle and Lambeth Palace. In 2005 he addressed a CCJ meeting at the Synod of the Church of England. Mirvis was the first United Synagogue rabbi to host an address by an imam, Dr. Mohammed Essam El-Din Fahim, in his synagogue. He has also led a delegation of members of his community to the Finchley Mosque and initiated a joint project between his synagogue and the mosque for a Jewish-Muslim public service day on 25 December. In 2016, Mirvis launched the ‚ÄòIn Good Faith‚Äô programme, in partnership with Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The initiative is a way of bringing Anglican and Jewish clergy together so that they might encourage their respective congregations to work on interfaith projects together.  Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom  Mirvis was named the successor to Jonathan, Lord Sacks as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth on 17 December 2012. Mirvis took office on 1 September 2013. His appointment was welcomed by the Conference of European Rabbis. Jeremy Newmark, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council in the UK, called the appointment ‚Äúimmensely popular.‚Äù Laura Janner-Klausner, the head rabbi of the Movement for Reform Judaism in Great Britain, said: \\"I welcome the appointment of Mirvis as another powerful voice for British Jewry. I look forward to working closely with him as a partner on areas of common interests to the Jewish and wider community.\\" The Orthodox Union in the United States also welcomed Mirvis‚Äô selection as the Chief Rabbi. Views and achievements  Mirvis was an advocate for the freedom of Soviet Jewry as Chairman of the Irish National Council for Soviet Jewry between 1984 and 1992. In 1986 he lobbied successfully against the request of a Dutch Nazi war criminal, Pieter Menten, to reside in Ireland. Mirvis has led campaigns to improve the quality of life, safety and security in and around shuls in the United Kingdom and London in particular. As Chief Rabbi of Ireland and before the opening of an Israeli Embassy in Ireland, he represented Israel‚Äôs interests at government level and in the media. In 1999, he led a group of British rabbis on a solidarity trip to Israel. Since 1997, he hosted the annual Bnei Akiva Yom Ha'atzmaut service at Finchley shul where it is still held. Regarding the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, while deploring the loss of life in Gaza, Mirvis defended Israel's right to protect itself from Hamas rocket attacks, adding that the conflict was used as a cover to voice antisemitic sentiment. Following his appointment, he created the ‚ÄòCentre for Community excellence‚Äô. This new department of the Office of the Chief Rabbi provides guidance and seed funding to Jewish communities, in order to promote the most creative and dynamic programming ideas. One of his most successful campaigns is ‚ÄòShabbat UK‚Äô which was based upon the Shabbat Project, which originated in South Africa. The campaign encourages all Jews, regardless of religious affiliation or level of observance to engage better with Shabbat and reaches tens of thousands of people across the country. Shortly after beginning his tenure, Mirvis announced that he would become the first Chief Rabbi to attend the annual Limmud Conference, a move which was considered extremely controversial at the time and a departure from the approach of his predecessor Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks. Mirvis has also supported the expanding of women's roles in Orthodox Judaism. In 2012, he appointed Lauren Levin as Britain‚Äôs first Orthodox female halakhic adviser, at Finchley Shul in London. He also supports Shabbat prayer groups for Orthodox women, saying, \\"Some of our congregations have women prayer groups for Friday night, some Saturday mornings. This is without women reading from the Torah. But for women to come together as a group to pray, this is a good thing.\\" http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/122918/interview- rabbi-ephraim-mirvis He also supports women becoming United Synagogue trustees, and Orthodox women reciting Kaddish. In 2016, Mirvis launched a new qualification for female educators to be advisers on Jewish law in the area of family purity and as adult educators in Orthodox shuls. The part-time training course, known as the Ma‚Äôayan Programme, is 18 months long and is the first such course in the United Kingdom. Mirvis has also made strides to encourage women to take their Jewish learning seriously, creating a series of events to encourage them to do so under the brand ‚ÄòNeshama‚Äô. Ephraim Mirvis in London, Feb 2015 However, Mirvis also upholds the normative Orthodox Jewish positions that female rabbis and same-sex marriages are not permitted. In September 2018, Mirvis issued a guide on the well-being of LGBT+ pupils in Orthodox Jewish schools. The guide was the first of its kind anywhere in the world. It upheld the traditional prohibitions against the act of homosexuality, but made clear that the Torah still demands \\"sensitivity to the feelings of everyone, including LGBT+ people\\" and that there should be a zero-tolerance approach to either homophobic or transphobic bullying or disregard for their wellbeing.https://www.thejc.com/comment/comment/chief-rabbi-ephraim-mirvis- lgbt-orthodox-schools-1.469306 He also stated \\"Young LGBT+ people in the Jewish community often express feelings of deep isolation, loneliness and a sense that they can never be themselves. Many are living with the fear that if they share their struggles with anyone they will be expelled, ridiculed and even rejected by family and friends. They may even be struggling with a loss of emunah (faith, trust in God) and the fear of losing their place of acceptance and belonging in the Jewish community.\\" In 2017, when Rabbi Joseph Dweck, the Senior Rabbi of the Sephardi Jewish community in the UK, made controversial comments about aspects of Jewish law, including on homosexuality, a bitter scandal erupted which threatened to split the Orthodox Jewish establishment. It was Mirvis who stepped in to diffuse the row, enabling Dweck to remain in his position without further controversy. Intervention in British Politics In late November 2019, Mirvis made an unprecedented interventionHenry Zeffman,Jeremy Corbyn ‚Äònot for high office‚Äô: Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis speaks out on Labour anti-Semitism, The Australian 27 November 2019. in British politics by stating in The Times that the Labour Party candidate Jeremy Corbyn was unfit for high office. While allowing that, ‚ÄúConvention dictates that the Chief Rabbi stays well away from party politics ‚Äì and rightly so‚Äù, he added that the forthcoming elections constituted an exception, since ‚Äúthe very soul of our nation is at stake‚Äù.According to Mirvis, 'the overwhelming majority of British Jews are gripped by anxiety' over the possibility that Labour might win the election and over perceived inadequacies in the Labour Party's handling of anti-Jewish racism. Such racism was incompatible with British values. Arguing that Corbyn's statements that the issues have been dealt with were a 'mendacious fiction', he suggested that voters go to the polls to make a 'conscience vote'. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby echoed Mirvis's concerns about Jewish sensitivities. A Labour spokeswoman replied that,'Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and has made absolutely clear it has no place in our party and society and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.' A backlash on social media suggested that Mirvis‚Äôs comments about antisemitism may have been connected to his support for Israel‚Äôs actions against the Gaza Strip, uneasy at the Labour platform support for a Palestinian state, the withholding of arms sales to Israel in protest over violation of Palestinian human rights in occupied territories, where the yeshiva Mirvis was trained in is located. Awards and recognition Mirvis received the Jerusalem Prize for Education in the Diaspora in 1990, on behalf of the Stratford Jewish Schools, from the President of Israel, Chaim Herzog. In 2015 he was awarded the Freedom of the London Borough of Barnet. He has received honorary doctorates from Touro College and Middlesex University. Family Mirvis married Zimbabwe-born Valerie Kaplan, in Israel. They have four sons, Hillel, Daniel, Noam and Eitan, and twelve grandchildren. Their eldest child, Liora Graham, died of cancer in 2011. Valerie Mirvis was a front line Child Protection Social Worker until May 2012. She is a published author and healthcare specialist. Mirvis's cousin is the American novelist, Tova Mirvis.

The championship was first contested as the FIFA Club World Championship in 2000. It was not held between 2001 and 2004 due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. Following a change in format which saw the FIFA Club World Championship absorb the Intercontinental Cup, it was relaunched in 2005 and took its current name the season afterwards. The current format of the tournament involves seven teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation over a period of about two weeks; the winners of that year's edition of the Asian AFC Champions League, African CAF Champions League, North American CONCACAF Champions League, South American Copa Libertadores, Oceanian OFC Champions League and European UEFA Champions League, along with the host nation's national champion, participate in a straight knockout tournament. Spanish club Real Madrid lead the table in most titles, most wins and most points. Auckland City have the most appearances with 9 and also hold the dubious record of the most losses with a total of ten.

It is widely accepted that the physiological correlates for memories are stored at the synapse between various neurons. The relative strength of various synapses in a network of neurons form the memory trace, or ‚Äòengram,‚Äô though the processes that support this finding are less thoroughly understood. The de novo protein synthesis theory states that the production of proteins is required to initiate and potentially maintain these plastic changes within the brain. It has much support within the neuroscience community, but some critics claim that memories can be made independent of protein synthesis.  History  Originally, protein synthesis inhibitors (PSI) were only used as antibiotics. Through various mechanisms unique to each PSI, they would inhibit the synthesis of proteins, generally at the translational level. They achieved renown within the biological scientific community, when research on protein synthesis required PSI's to investigate certain physiological processes. Through this line of research, it was found that injection of PSI in the hippocampus resulted in amnesia: the memories undergoing consolidation at the time of injection were lost (Flexner & Flexner, 1966). After the injection, the animals (generally rats) would have their memories retested, and, as a consequence of interrupted memory consolidation, they reacted to a familiar situation as though they were in a novel environment. This gave rise to the de novo protein synthesis theory: the formation of a long-term memory requires the synthesis of new proteins. Eric Kandel established many of the biochemical markers of learning and memory in the Aplysia (California sea slug) in the 1970s, as his findings suggested potential pathways surrounding protein synthesis (Abel, Nguyen, Barad, Deuel, Kandel & Bourtchouladze, 1997). He won the Nobel prize in 2000 for his research (Kandel, n.d.). In the same year, Nader published his findings about the liability of retrieved memories that had already undergone consolidation. (Nader, Schafe, & Le Doux, 2000). For example, memories of past events are examples of memories that have already been consolidated. Nader discovered that, in the process of remembering, retrieved memories that became reactivated would require consolidation again. Various factors could interrupt this process; but without protein synthesis, memory re-consolidation would not occur and would result in the potential loss of the retrieved memory. This has been known as the reconsolidation theory of memory, which states that, after reactivation, memories undergo a process similar to initial consolidation to return them to their permanent state. Since then, a wealth of research has been done to clarify the mechanisms, genes, and proteins involved in the physiological correlate of memory.  Protein synthesis inhibitors  Protein synthesis inhibitors are a class of antibiotics, which prevent the production of new proteins by inhibiting the cell's gene expression (\\"Protein synthesis inhibitors\\", PSI). They generally operate at the ribosomal level through various mechanisms that prevent the ribosome from completing translation (Vazquez, 1967). Protein synthesis inhibitors that work in prokaryotic cells are often used as clinically prescribed antibiotics, while those that act of eukaryotic cells have been adapted for research purposes. In research, commonly used PSI's include anisomycin, cycloheximide, and puromycin - although the use of puromycin has stopped recently because of its toxic qualities and numerous side effects (Burka, Ballas, & Sabesin, 1975). Anisomycin has relatively high effectiveness in inhibiting protein synthesis and has a large effective time window (Villers, Godaux, & Ris, 2012). Cycloheximide is frequently used in acute studies, because of its high level of inhibition and ease of reversibility (Villers, Godaux, & Ris, 2012).  Physiological changes   Long term potentiation  A line of research investigates long term potentiation (LTP), a process that describes how a memory can be consolidated between two neurons, or brain cells, ultimately by creating a circuit within the brain that can encode a memory. To initiate a learning circuit between two neurons, one prominent study described using tetanus stimulations to depolarize one neuron by 30mV, which, in turn, activated its NMDA glutamate receptors (Nowak, Bregestovski, Ascher, Herbert, & Prochiantz, 1984). The activation of these receptors resulted in Ca2+ flooding the cell, initiating a cascade of secondary messengers. The cascade of resulting reactions, brought about by secondary messengers, terminates with the activation of cAMP response binding element protein (CREB), which acts as a transcription factor for various genes and initiates their expression (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006). Some proponents argue that the genes stimulate changes in communication between neurons, which underlie the encoding of memory; others suggest that the genes are byproducts of the LTP signaling pathway and are not directly involved in LTP. However, following the cascade of secondary messengers, no one would dispute that more AMPA receptors appear in the postsynaptic terminal (Hayashi et al., 2000). Higher numbers of AMPA receptors, taken together with the aforementioned events, allow for increased firing potential in the postsynaptic cell, which creates an improved learning circuit between these two neurons (Hayashi et al., 2000). Because of the specific, activity- dependent nature of LTP, it is an ideal model for a neural correlate of memory, as postulated by numerous studies; together, these studies show that the abolishment of LTP prevents the formation of memory at the neuronal level (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006).  Systems consolidation  Systems consolidation is the process by which memories are shifted from a vulnerable state to a fairly permanent one (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). It also describes roles that certain brain structures, most notably the hippocampus, play in memory consolidation and the extent certain types of memories can be consolidated. LTP describes cellular level consolidation, which is the consolidation of a memory that occurs between individual neurons. Initially, cellular consolidation, or LTP, begins in the hippocampus; there, protein synthesis inhibitors, tetrodotoxin, lidocaine, lesions and other factors can interfere with hippocampal activity and cause memory deficits (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). The systems consolidation theory of memory is usually investigated by studying the loss of memory for past events (retrograde amnesia) that occurs as a result of damage to the hippocampus, which is involved in systems consolidation. Retrograde amnesia can be either temporally graded (older memories are affected less) or flat (all memories, regardless of age, are affected equally), depending on the type of memory encoded and the extent of hippocampal damage (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). = Semantic memory = Semantic memories (memories of facts) are one type of memory that is theorized to undergo complete systems consolidation in the hippocampus. Complete systems consolidation can eventually render semantic memories permanent, at which state they become independent from the hippocampus (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). There is evidence of semantic memories existing independently of any brain structure, especially when considering that the damage retrograde amnesia inflicts on semantic memory is temporally graded: there is a higher probability of older memories being retained even when the hippocampus is completely damaged (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). Newer semantic memories show a more variable likelihood of retainability, as they can be affected by minimal or complete destruction of the hippocampus (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). = Episodic memory = Episodic memories (memories of moments or events) is a type of memory that may not undergo complete systems consolidation; as a result, they remain entirely dependent on the hippocampus (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). Therefore, they cannot exist independently of any brain structures, unlike semantic memories. Evidence shows that complete hippocampal damage results in flat retrograde amnesia for episodic memories, including older memories (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011). However, if the hippocampus is only partially damaged, then it is possible for the amnesia to have a temporal gradient (Sutherland & Lehman, 2011) similar to one seen with semantic memories: older memories are more likely to be retained and newer memories less. = Sleep and systems consolidation = The mechanism for systems consolidation is unknown, but it has been established that protein synthesis must occur in the cortex, where the hippocampal independent memory is stored, and that sleep is likely to play a role in systems consolidation (Stickgold & Walker, 2005). Many genes are upregulated during sleep, and therefore there is a possibility that protein synthesis is active in sleep- consolidation (Stickgold & Walker, 2005). It remains to be seen if cortical consolidation uses the same mechanisms as the hippocampus to establish the memory trace.  Proposed de novo proteins  Once it was established that proteins were involved in the formation of memories, and an understanding of how the processes surrounding the proteins worked was formed, the next stage was to identify candidates for plasticity related proteins (proteins that would support the plastic changes between neurons, PRP). While many molecules, proteins and enzymes have been implicated in the associated processes of memory, identifying the specific proteins that are synthesized specifically to facilitate memory is a challenge. Listed below are the most common candidates for PRPs that support memory and learning functions.  PKMzeta  In 2011 Todd Sacktor proposed a model for how de novo protein synthesis modulates plasticity. Protein Kinase M zeta (PKMzeta) is a plasticity related protein that regulates the physiological processes that underlie learning and memory in Sacktor's model. PKMzeta is an isoform of protein kinase C, which differs in that it doesn't have an auto-inhibitory domain that requires high levels of substrate to perpetually activate the enzyme (Sacktor, 2011). PKMzeta mRNA is transported to the synaptic zones of the dendrites, where it is translated through the activity of multiple signaling pathways associated with LTP (Sacktor, 2011). After expression, PKMzeta requires an initial phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), after which it can operate uninhibited (Sacktor, 2011). Protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) normally propagates the endocytic removal of AMPA receptors containing the GluR2 subunit from the postsynaptic regions (Sacktor, 2011). PKMzeta and PICK1 share a common binding site, which allows them to form a multiprotein complex (Sacktor, 2011). N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) can disrupt the binding of PICK1 to the C-terminal of the AMPA receptors (Sacktor, 2011). This allows PKM zeta to phosphorylate the receptors, which traffics them to the synapse and enables easier excitability of the neuron (Sacktor, 2011). When in the membrane, a tyrosine dense binding site in the GluR2 AMPA receptors is used by brefeldin-resistant Arf-GEF 2 (BRAG2) to be actively removed from the synapse, where it is maintained in vesicles by PICK1 (Sacktor, 2011). PMKzeta continuously phosphorylates the GluR2 AMPA receptors to maintain their presence within the synaptic membrane (Sacktor, 2011). There have been many studies to confirm the roles of each of these molecules, though there is always doubt and speculation of alternative processes (Villers, Godaux, & Ris, 2012). PKMzeta makes a great model for the de novo protein synthesis hypothesis. The effects of LTP summate to allow PKMzeta to be transcribed, which requires ribosomal activity in the dendrites (Sacktor, 2011). Blocking translation or transcription of proteins would prevent PKMzeta from being expressed, preventing the strengthening of neuronal networks that underlie a memory (Hawkins, Kandel, & Bailey, 2006). Because of its long half life, the maintenance of receptors at a synapse is not affected by PSI (Sacktor, 2011). But the creation of a new memory would require new PKMzeta expression, which accounts for the specificity of PSI induced amnesia (Sacktor, 2011).  Brain derived neurotrophic factor  Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin associated with plasticity and growth of the central nervous system (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2007). It is a PRP candidate because its expression is closely related to activity, and abnormalities in its translation and signaling results in L-LTP deficits and amnesia (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2007). BDNF has been shown to enhance the activity of early LTP, but the longer lasting phases of LTP are thought to require protein synthesis (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2007). BDNF translation inhibition through PSI has shown the characteristic LTP blocking and amnesia, which has been followed up with genetic knockouts of the BDNF expressing gene (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2007). In these BDNF deficient animals the application of external BDNF can allow for the induction of LTP (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2007). There have been cases where BDNF needed not be present for the induction of LTP, suggesting that there may be in fact many parallel PRP pathways that lead to memory formation (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2007). BDNF and PKMzeta have some interaction effects. When LTP was induced in cell cultures in BDNF dependent ways (Theta burst stimulation or an increase in cAMP concentration) it was abolished with the application of ZIP (zeta-inhibitory peptide), a protein thought to specifically inactivate PKMzeta (Mei, et al., 2011). This suggests that PKMzeta is the end modulator of LTP and learning (Mei, et al., 2011). As expected PKMzeta levels dropped when PSIs were applied, but curiously this was not the case if BDNF was also applied (Mei, et al., 2011). These findings show that BDNF modulates the LTP process to make it protein synthesis independent, contrary to the de novo protein synthesis theory.  Criticisms   Electrical activity  When anisomycin is applied to the hippocampus, active memories are unable to fully consolidate and are lost. When anisomycin is applied to cell cultures, electrical activity within the cultures cease (Sharma, Nargang, & Dickson, 2012). This particular property of PSIs was not accounted for when the de novo protein synthesis theory was established, and is an alternative explanation for the amnesiac effects of PSIs. If a neuron is not electrically active, it is not transmitting information; therefore, the lack of electrical activity in the neuron by itself could be responsible for the loss of a memory (Sharma, Nargang, & Dickson, 2012). Anisomycin administered at a dose that inhibits 95% of protein synthesis and associated electrical activity is not the highest dosage used in PSI research (Sharma, Nargang, & Dickson, 2012). Higher doses may alter other processes other than protein synthesis to cause the silencing of neural activity, considering Puromycin has cytotoxic qualities, so its possible that other PSI might have similar effects that manifest in the interruption of neural firing (Burka, Ballas, & Sabesin, 1975). Additionally, anisomycin has been shown to cause a substantial catecholamine release that co-occurs with neural suppression, which has not been fully explained yet (Sharma, Nargang, & Dickson, 2012). These side effects other than the inhibition of protein synthesis may account for the amnesiac effects induced by PSI, but these findings are relatively new and are expected to receive much research attention in the near future.  Memory formation and LTP independent of protein synthesis  Demonstrating that memories can be formed, and that LTP can be initiated, without protein synthesis strongly reduces the strength of the de novo theory, which explicitly states that synthesis is required to form memories. As a result, many studies have shown various ways of inducing these events while specimens are under the effects of anisomycin or other protein synthesis inhibitors (Villers, Godaux, & Ris, 2012). BDNF applied to cell cultures with PSI still undergo LTP, suggesting that post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or horizontal transport could be employed in the absence of protein synthesis (Lu, Christian, & Lu, 2009). Additionally ZIP has amnesiac effects, but its specificity to PKMzeta have been questioned, which questions the accuracy of the PKMzeta model (Wu-Zhang, et al., 2012).

AP Bank's seed money was provided by record producer Takeshi Kobayashi, musician Kazutoshi Sakurai and composer and musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. It channels its finance to small-scale sustainable projects that would otherwise struggle to receive loan funding. Beneficiaries have ranged from a recycling program in the far south of Kyushu, Japan, to the construction of an eco-resort in the Marshall Islands. AP Bank holds its own festival since 2005. AP Bank Fes raises awareness about environmental issues such as recycling and global warming, with all profits from the festival going to fund more projects at AP Bank. History The concept for AP Bank arose out of a series of seminars in 2002 by the members of composer Ryuichi Sakamoto's Artists Power, a project started in 2001 by Sakamoto and Takuro of Glay to engender more financial responsibility amongst musicians. Seminar organiser and music producer Takeshi Kobayashi invited members to learn from experts about citizen's banks, where money is used according to the depositor's wishes as opposed to regular banks where depositors rarely know how their deposits are used. Presenter Yu Tanaka, executive director of non-profit organization the Mirai Bank, established in 1994, encouraged the members to start their own citizen's bank in order to invest in wind turbines. In June 2003 AP Bank was officially founded as a non- profit bank able to offer loan financing, with a goal of tackling environmental problems. It was started with an initial investment of ¬•100 million (approx. US$952,000) each from music producer Takeshi Kobayashi, musician Kazutoshi Sakurai and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto. A former manager from one of Japan's largest regular banks, Mitsui Sumitomo also joined as a key member of the team. AP Bank, which operates as a lender with low interest rates, began receiving applications for loans online from May 1, 2004, receiving 75 applications in its first month and granting 14 in its first year worth a total of approximately ¬•50 million (US$476,000). Initial projects were asked to reach requirements such as not lasting longer than 10 years and requiring not more than ¬•5 million ($47,600). The annual interest rate was set at of 1% and examples of those that were first accepted included a forest revival project in Kagoshima, a bicycle rental service using abandoned cycles in Yokohama, the use of bio-gas from kitchen refuse in Saitama, and the construction of an eco-resort in the Marshall Islands. \\"AP Bank\\" took its name from Sakamoto's Artists Power but also stands for Alternative Power. AP Bank initially operated only on its founding member's capital, refusing to accept investment from the general public, in order to test the initiative. Funding is generated by regular releases by Sakurai's Bank Band, which performs and releases CDs and DVDs in collaboration with a wide range of guests artists. Further funding is generated by AP Bank's own AP Bank Fes, AP BANG! Tokyo Creators' Meetings and Yoyogi Village. At the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards Japan on May 31, U2's Bono presented Kazutoshi Sakurai and Kobayashi Takeshi with the 'Rock The World' award for their work creating AP Bank. Bono commented; \\"I am honored for my message to be passed on here. It is a prize suitable for the party who keeps reciting a wonderful message that all can resonate through rock, named the 'Rock The World Award'\\". Sakurai accepted, commenting \\"I think this award could be won thanks to the endorsement of AP Bank by all artists.\\" On November 18, 2011, Kobayashi opened Yoyogi Village, a mini-town featuring shops by Kurkku, organic restaurants and cafes, a bookstore, travel agent, garden and an all-night music bar. Kobayashi commented that \\"\\"There is no philosophy or vision within the government at the moment, so the private sector has to lead when it comes to selling ecology and the economy.\\" In 2012, AP Bank Fes expanded to three festival sites and was joined by its first international artist, Jason Mraz, a strong supporter of Farm Aid. Aims AP Bank's original website stated its purpose as \\"AP Bank's main loan targets are small businesses that ordinary people can manage, not large business entities. As in the case of renewable energy - often described as \\"decentralized energy\\" because it is generated locally - a variety of ideas appropriate to each community are needed to improve its environment. By supporting small projects being attempted by people in their own communities, we hope to encourage more people to think that they can change society through their own efforts. The result will be another, new type of future.\\" AP Bank is also committed to the idea of \\"eco-resonance\\"‚Äîfostering eco-awareness. Kobayashi has described in a 2007 interview with TIME magazine that \\"money for the sake of money isn't great, but money is a tool, and people can use it as a community.\\" Kazuyuki Tsuchiya of the green group A Seed Japan has said of AP Bank that \\"I think that because they started this movement, it's helped ordinary folks become aware of environmental problems and finance.\\" Key members Kazutoshi Sakurai, founder of AP Bank and leader of rock group Mr.Children is a well-known music producer, lyricist, composer and keyboardist. He is best known for his work with the popular band Mr. Children. In 1996, he teamed up with Shunji Iwai to create the music for the film Swallowtail Butterfly with J-pop singer Chara.

He began his career in 1978 as a member of the pioneering electronic music group Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO), where he played keyboards and was an occasional vocalist. Sakamoto was the originator of the concept of Artists' Power, a project by various artists to promote renewable energy started in 2001. Sakamoto stepped back from regular involvement in AP Bank after its initial set-up due to his living in New York rather than Japan where AP Bank is primarily active. Key projects AP Bank Fes The first AP Bank Fes took place from July 16 to 18 2005 in Kakegawa, Shizuoka as a multi-purpose outdoor festival, featuring live performances but also a wide variety of areas to teach about environmental issues such as sustainable development, natural farming and renewable energy issues like solar power. It features a marketplace selling various natural goods as well as relaxation areas and a natural food court. AP Bank Fes encourages the audience to bring their own cutlery to the event, while the waste generated is separated into nine categories so that most can be recycled. AP Bank Fes expanded to three festival sites in 2012, including Hyogo and Miyagi Prefectures. The main festival site is provided by the Yamaha Corporation and led to an initiative called Japan Natural Energy \\"Green Power Certificate\\" to provide \\"green power\\" for other music events at the site. It is expected to conserve 500,000 kWh of electricity and reduce 230 tons of CO2 emissions per year at the site. Funds raised from the festival, which attracts around 60,000 people, and resultant CDs and DVDs, are donated to AP Bank. The live shows are structured with Kazutoshi Sakurai's Bank Band as the main performer, featuring various guests vocalists, which have included;Jason Mraz was the first international artist to perform at AP Bank Fes * 2005 - Salyu, Chara, Every Little Thing, Hitoto Yo, Tortoise Matsumoto (Ulfuls), Mika Nakashima etc. * 2006 - Kobukuro, BoA, Bonnie Pink, Miki Imai, Remioromen, Quruli, Kreva etc. * 2007 - AI, Depapepe, Ulfuls, ~~Rip Slyme, Kumi Koda, Sukima Switch~~ (cancelled due to typhoon) etc. * 2008 - Glay, My Little Lover, Ayaka Hirahara, Chihiro Onitsuka, Yuzu, Aska etc. * 2009 - Juju, Kumi Koda, Yuna Ito, Ai Otsuka, Eikichi Yazawa, Porno Graffitti etc. * 2010 - Cocco, Mongol800, Puffy, Dragon Ash, Toshinobu Kubota, Funky Monkey Babys etc. * 2011 - Hitoto Yo, Shikao Suga.

Tokyo Creators' Meeting AP Bank organises an all-night club event for artists, musicians, and other creative people called AP BANG! Tokyo Creators' Meeting. The purpose is to make people think about the environment, through creations and performances for a younger crowd that might typically have less interest or knowledge of environmental concerns. Vol.1 took place over three days at Studio Coast in Shin Kiba, Tokyo, from March 16-18th 2007 and featured art directors, filmmakers, web designers and copywriters as well as performing acts such as Seamo, Ky≈çko Koizumi and Ayaka. Eco-reso web AP Bank operates an extensive network of websites and blogs called eco-reso web („Ç®„Ç≥„É¨„Çæ „Ç¶„Ç®„Éñ). Initially a web magazine that communicates about events in Japan and around the world relating to the environment by means of news articles, videos and illustrations, eco-reso web now includes a wide range of web pages on various ecological, environmental, eco-farming and sustainable development issues. kurkku Kurkku is a Tokyo-based project owning several shops under the theme \\"future-oriented living that is comfortable and good for the environment\\". Kurkku sells food and clothing and AP Bank provides conceptual input and assistance. Kurkku's main restaurant and cafe are located in Harajuku. Code kurkku, serving Italian-style food prepared by executive chef Yasuhiro Sasajima, whose Kyoto restaurant Il Ghiottone is said to \\"serve the finest Italian cuisine in all of Western Japan\\", and is housed within the Yoyogi Village complex. Yoyogi Village Combining elements of many of AP Bank's projects, Yoyogi Village is perhaps its most open to the general public, aiming to break the perception that environmentally friendly products are bland or boring. It was built in order to reinvigorate Yoyogi on the old site of the 19th century Yoyogi village, before the rise of the neighboring districts Shinjuku and Harajuku led to the areas decline. Yoyogi Village consists of the two zones surrounding a central landscaped garden by Seijyun Nishihata featuring trees from Spain, Chile, Brazil and Mexico. The village consists of a wide range of stores, cafes and restaurants as well as a travel agent, massage parlor and gardens. The Container Zone is made from old shipping containers and sells fashion from organic cotton farms in India at One Mile Wear, houses the Pour-kur bakery, organic Drink & Soup Kurkku Lab, Roots & Beat Coffee and Tako Yoyogi izakaya and hosts the Blind Gallery. The Village Zone hosts The Music Bar designed by Kobayashi and fellow producer Shinichi Osawa, VIP areas and the Code Kurkku dining and terrace area with discounted organic food prepared by Kyoto chef Yasuhiro Sasajima. The land in the center of Tokyo has been leased for an initial ten years, with a view to building more villages in the future. AP Bank Fund In July 2007, the Niigata 2007 Ch≈´etsu offshore earthquake hit Japan‚Äôs Niigata Prefecture, at the same time as the AP Bank Fes'07 music festival was taking place - itself cut from three days to one due to a typhoon. As a result of these two catastrophes, AP Bank Fund was created to provide funds for disaster relief, separate from AP Bank's regular lending operations. The ap bank fund was created in September 2007, and in June 2008 it provided relief funds for victims of the 2007 Ch≈´etsu offshore earthquake, a devastating cyclone in Myanmar, and another major earthquake in Sichuan, China.

As a curling pond it was probably known as the Fullarton House Pond, located as it was on the edge of the Fullarton House and Crosbie Castle estate curtilage, It was originally a shallow and overgrown freshwater loch, hence the name Reed Loch and its marshy appearance on Johnson's 1828 map. It was cleaned out and used as a curling pond in the latter part of the 19th century before falling out of use and being drained in the late 20th century. History The loch was a natural feature, probably a post-glacial 'Kettle Hole' once of greater extent, fed mainly by the Darley Burn, rainfall, and field drainage. Its existence is recorded in the placename of Lochgreen House. The Darley Burn was diverted away from the site which however remained dominated by reeds willows and at best constituted poor quality grazing. The loch site is fully drained today (datum 2012) however it still floods in winter. The old Crosbie church and cemetery lie to the south of the old loch site. The Isle of Pins Road is named for the unusual pillar that stands near the old entrance drive to Fullarton House and the name derives from the time when the pillar stood as a folly or feature on what was an island prior to the draining of the loch circa 1800.Kirkwood, Page 65 In 1876 the Reed Loch is recorded as being the favourite curling loch in the district. The drainage of the loch is this area is a covered burn that runs in front of Lochgreen and gravel beds prominent in the nearby field show the one time extent of standing water in the area.Kirkwood, Page 65 Usage The Fullarton estate Ice House. Fullarton House had an ice house that was constructed from the ruins of Crosbie Castle and this would require to be filled with ice from a site such as the Reed Loch. No watermills seem to have been associated with Reed Loch. It was latterly dug out and used for curling; a possible curling house is shown just to the south of the loch margin.Curling Sites Retrieved : 2012-12-16 Various curling matches are recorded, with Monkton v. Troon playing a friendly game on Reed Loch in 1861. Fullarton House Pond played host to a match between Troon Portland v Ayr Albert in 1862. Cartographic evidence The 1857 OS map shows the Reed Loch in amongst what is probably willow dominated woodland. The Darley Burn may have fed the loch until it was covered over and diverted.25 in OS Map Retrieved : 2012-12-16 The 1896 Os map shows a very different water body, a large curling pond now covering 2.37 acres and with open water and no woodland. The small building indicated may be a Curling house. By 1958 the OS map shows the curling pond to be overgrown and no longer marked as a curling pond. By the late 1970s the wetland area is shown for some unknown reason as 'Monktonhill Ground'. The 20 metre contour delineates the limit of the old loch to the north and east. Drainage The loch's drainage may have begun in the 18th century when Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton, was pursuing a number of agricultural improvements on his extensive estates and other landowners were following his example. Old maps show that the Darley Burn once ran through the Fullarton estate as an open water course. Micro- history Lochgreen Junction was once located on the nearby railway line.

Miko≈Çaja), or Polish Church (Polnische Kirche; Polish: ko≈õci√≥≈Ç polski) was the oldest church in the city formerly known as K√∂nigsberg, and today known as Kaliningrad, Russia. History The church's original form was a wooden Catholic chapel of Saint Nicholas first documented in 1256. It was built at K√∂nigsberg's first German settlement, located northwest of K√∂nigsberg Castle. After the original settlement was destroyed during the Siege of K√∂nigsberg, the church was rebuilt in stone in 1263.Albinus, p. 304 The suburb of Altstadt which developed around the church and replaced the first German settlement became known as Steindamm. The small cemetery church affiliated with Altstadt Church was converted to Lutheranism in 1525 with the creation of the Duchy of Prussia. It was granted to non- German Protestants with service in the vernacular; services for Lithuanians had started in 1523.Andreas Osiander. Gesamtausgabe. Schriften und Briefe 1549 bis August 1551 Most of the non-Germans were Masurians and Prussian Lithuanians from ducal Prussia, while a minority were religious refugees from the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.Gause I, p. 236 The church was renovated or rebuilt anew at a cost of 700 Mark. It remained poor, however, not having its own parish or revenue. In 1529 Johannes Wnorowius (Jan Wnorowski) became the first Polish-speaking preacher at the Steindamm church. Seclucianus (Jan Seklucjan) translated the New Testament into Polish there during the 1540s. Lithuanian-speaking preachers included Bartholomeus Willentius (Wilentis, died 1587) in 1554 and his successor, Johann Bretke. Sharing of the church caused disputes between the Poles and Lithuanians, however, and the pastors could sometimes not hear themselves over the din. After the death of Bretke in 1602, the Poles increased their efforts to control the church. In 1603 the Protestant Lithuanians received St. Elizabeth's Church in Sackheim for themselves, after the Catholic Jesuits had become interested in the situation. As St. Nicholas' Church in Steindamm had become predominantly Polish, it was nicknamed the Polish Church. The consistory granted a second priest to the church in 1613 because of the size of the congregation. All new Polish-speaking pastors of the church were born in East Prussia and educated in K√∂nigsberg; none came from Poland.Gause I, p. 414 The church was used for Orthodox services during the occupation of K√∂nigsberg by the Imperial Russian Army from 1758-62 during the Seven Years' War, after which Lutheran services resumed in Polish. Otto Nicolai was baptized in the church on 21 June 1810. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, it was used as a jail and field hospital. Because of declining demand, the church's Polish sermons stopped in 1874, with weekly Polish- language service continuing only for soldiers from Masuria.Armstedt, p. 20Gause II, p. 693 In 1880 a new parish for Steindamm separate from that of New Altstadt Church was created from parts of Altstadt, L√∂benicht, Tragheim, and Neurossgarten. Polish service for Masurians ceased altogether in 1901 as the Masurian soldiers sufficiently understood German. In 1928 it was cleansed of defective plaster from the Baroque era. Although Steindamm Church survived the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II, it was destroyed by Red Army artillery during the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. The remains were demolished by the Soviet administration in Kaliningrad in 1950Wac≈Çaw Podbereski, SƒÖsiedzi: Kr√≥lewiec ‚Äì Koenigsberg ‚Äì Kaliningrad [w:] \\"Znad Wilii\\" nr 4(44) 2010, s. 113-117 to expand the thoroughfare Leninskiy Prospekt. Design By the first quarter of the 14th century, the church consisted of a large single-nave with three vaulted bays and a large wheel window on the southern entrance.Antoni, p. 310 Its steeple was built during the 15th century. After collapsing in 1559 without injury, its reconstructed spire was completed in 1710.

The student body is racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse. Many have other disabilities, such as mobility and mental impairments, and most live below the poverty threshold set by New York City. The school's focus is on, in addition to assisting students in living with their disabilities, preparing them for higher education with an academic curriculum compliant with the New York State Education Department standards from preschool to its fully accredited high school. The school utilizes a \\"mediated learning experience\\" (MLE) approach which provides training for parents and teachers as part of its emphasis on the importance of adult mediators to education. The school uses American Sign Language (abbreviated ASL) and English for instruction. In 1994, the school was subject to a community protest following the appointment of a hearing chairman of the board without what protesters felt was adequate representation of the deaf community in the selection process. Following picket lines and other protest measures, Phil Bravin was placed in the position; Bravin had become the first deaf chair of the Gallaudet University Board following a similar protest in 1988. Lexington Hearing & Speech Center The Lexington Hearing & Speech Center is a medical center that provides clinical services in hearing and speech to people in New York City's five boroughs, including infants, children, adults, and seniors. Beyond attempting to determine the cause of speech and language difficulty, the center focuses on medical and rehabilitative care, with a specialty in hearing aids. They operate a Mobile Hearing Evaluation Unit which visits seniors and residences throughout the New York City metropolitan area to conduct hearing tests and evaluate and analyze hearing aids already in use. Lexington Vocational Services Center The Lexington Vocational Services Center, which has offices in New York and New Jersey, is intended to help deaf adults prepare for and obtain employment and also to help employers maintain deaf-friendly workplaces. They also host ASL classes for the community and employers. Lexington Center for Mental Health Services The Lexington Center for Mental Health Services provides mental health services to deaf adults and children, including evaluation, medication and treatment for those with mental illness and counseling for deaf parents of hearing children and hearing parents of deaf children.

All four crew on board and three people on the ground were killed. Citing BT 233/403 Flight On the day of the accident VX770 was flying from the Rolls-Royce airfield at Hucknall, with four crew on board, including a flight test engineer from Avro, carrying out performance tests on the Rolls-Royce Conway engines that had been fitted in place of the Sapphires and Avons originally fitted. During the course of the test-flight VX770 diverted to RAF Syerston to participate in the Battle of Britain day air show.Blackman, p. 151 Accident The Vulcan flew along runway 07 then started a rolling climb to starboard. During this manoeuvre the starboard wing disintegrated, resulting in a collapse of the main spar and wing structure.Blackman, p.151 The Vulcan went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground. Three occupants of a controllers' caravan were killed by debris, all four of the Vulcan crew were also killed. Three servicemen who were in an ambulance were also injured by debris from the crash. Cause The official primary cause for the accident was a gross structural failure of the aircraft's main spar, which was confirmed by amateur footage, photographs and eyewitness accounts. The reason for the failure was not determined by the Board of Inquiry (BoI), but it was suggested by an accident investigator called in by Rolls RoyceFile Note within TNA file BT 233/403 that the main cause was that the pilot, upon performing the planned aerobatic display, exceeded the prototype's briefed speed and turning rate limits. The accident investigator submitted a statementBoI Report Appendix 1 within TNA file BT 233/403 to the BoI, but did not give evidence under oath. The BoI was apparently not informed that the aircraft manufacturer considered the basis for the statement to be invalid.Avro letter dated 24 September 1958 within TNA file BT 233/403 The Technical Officer of the Board of Inquiry (BoI) identified a suspected fatigue failure of the inboard arm of the front bottom wing attachment main forging, and suggested vibration from the high airflow volumes required by the RR Conway 11 engines as a possible cause.BoI Report Appendix 2(ii) within TNA file BT 233/403 The Royal Aircraft Establishment carried out a structural analysis of the wreckage and produced a report on 21 April 1960,RAE memorandum A/11265/12/WH within TNA file BT 233/403 but no copy has been found in the public record. Tony Blackman argues that the maintenance crew failed to properly inspect the aircraft for known issues with stress damage to the aircraft's leading edges and structural ribs, which had been observed in another prototype he had flown earlier.Blackman, p. 152-153 Notes Bibliography * * Vulcan Mk 1, VX770: RAF Syerston, Notts, 20 Sept. 1958 Official incident report at The National Archives External links * Witness recalls the day a Vulcan bomber crashed at an airshow in Nottinghamshire, killing 7 people, 5 July 2020 * \\"Anniversary of Vulcan crash\\" BBC News, 19 September 2008. * Aviation Safety Network accident report Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in England Category:Accidents and incidents involving Royal Air Force aircraft Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1958 Category:1958 in England Category:Aviation accidents and incidents involving the Avro Vulcan Category:September 1958 events ","title":"1958 Syerston Avro Vulcan crash"},{"id":"37958063","text":"Karl Zolper (born 30 April 1901, date of death unknown) was a German international footballer.

Production continued till 1929 by which time Daimler had merged with Benz & Cie (effective 1926) as a result of which the car's name had changed to Mercedes-Benz Typ 400.Oswald, pp 206 & 215 A defining feature of the car was the switchable supercharger (‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù) fitted to the engine. Origins Plans for the car were drawn up by the company's Technical Director, Paul Daimler, son of the company's founder. Following an acrimonious disagreement about new model policy, Daimler left in 1922, transferring to rival manufacturer Horch. It was left to Daimler's successor as Technical Director to complete the development and handle the launch of the 15/70/100 PS. The strategy for the model's development appears to have been similar under both men, however, based on the company's successful racing cars, and using knowledge gained on the race track to develop a large fast (and very expensive) road car.Oswald, p 214  Naming conventions and horsepower  Daimler had been branding their passenger cars with the \\"Mercedes\\" name since 1902. For their model names at this time the manufacturer applied the widely followed German naming conventions of the time. On Daimler's Mercedes 15/70/100 PS the ‚Äú15‚Äù defined the car's tax horsepower, used by the authorities to determine the level of annual car tax to be imposed on car owners. The ‚Äú70‚Äù and the ‚Äú100‚Äù both defined the manufacturer's claims regarding car's actual power output as defined in metric horsepower. In Germany tax horsepower, which had been defined by statute since 1906, was based on the dimensions of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the cylinder stroke, and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower. The unusual feature in the naming of this car was the inclusion of two different power output figures. This arose from the fitting to the engine of a switchable supercharger (‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù). With the device switched off maximum claimed output was of . With the supercharger invoked, maximum output rose to . The Mercedes 15/70/100 PS survived the fusion of Daimler with Benz & Cie which came into effect in 1926 (although the agreement which defined the merger had been signed two years earlier in 1924). However, cars of the newly merged company were now branded ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz‚Äù and the model also acquired the new model name ‚ÄúTyp 400‚Äù, being now known as the Mercedes-Benz Typ 400 The alternative name Mercedes-Benz 15/70/100 PS was and is also sometimes used.  The car   Bodies  Many buyers will have purchased the car in bare chassis form and purchased bodywork separately from an independent coach builder. The manufacturer's listed body types were a four or (from 1925) six seater Torpedo bodied ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù, a six-seater ‚ÄùPullman-Limousine‚Äù, a six- seater ‚ÄúLandaulet‚Äù, a six-seater ‚ÄúCoupe-Limousine‚Äù and a 4-door four seater Cabriolet.Oswald, p 215 The engine  The six cylinder in-line 3920 cc engine featured an overhead camshaft which at the time was an unusual feature, with ‚Äúbevel linkage‚Äù. However, it was the switchable supercharger (‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù), adopted from the company's racing cars, that attracted most of the attention. With the device switched off maximum claimed output was of at 3,100 rpm: with the supercharger operating, maximum output rose to . The top speed listed was 105 km/h (65 mph) or 112 km/h (70 mph) according to which of the two offered final drive ratios was fitted. Chassis and running gear  Power was transmitted to the rear wheels via a multi-plate dry disc clutch (‚ÄúMehrscheibentrockenkupplung‚Äù) and a four speed manual transmission. The gear lever was initially to the driver's right, directly outside the door, but at some stage it was repositioned to what has subsequently become a more conventional location in the middle of the floor to the driver's left.Oswald, p 215 (At this time it was still normal, if no longer universal, in western Europe for the steering wheel and therefore also the driver to be placed on the right side of the car.) The suspension configuration followed the conventions of the time, using rigid beam axles and semi-elliptic leaf springs. Braking operated on all four wheels using a cable linkage.  Evolution  The car changed very little during its production life. The name change to Mercedes-Benz Typ 400 which followed the Daimler/Benz fusion was not accompanied by any changes to the car. However, in 1927 the centre of gravity was lowered as a result of a switch to an ‚Äúunderslung‚Äù chassis which left the axles directly above the longitudinal chassis members, whereas earlier car had applied the ‚ÄúHochbett‚Äù overslung chassis layout whereby the longitudinal chassis members were attached directly above the axles. In 1928 the effectiveness of the brakes was increased through the addition of a vacuum powered support (‚ÄúSaugluftunterst√ºtzung‚Äù).  Commercial  Before the mid-1926 merger Daimler produced 1002 of the Mercedes branded cars: following the merger which created ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz‚Äù a further 911 of the cars, now badged as Mercedes-Benz products, were produced. A customised version of the car was made for the tenor Richard Tauber.  Replacement  The car's replacement, designed in some haste under the auspices of the newly created company, was the Mercedes-Benz Typ N√ºrburg 460 (W08), which was much more aggressively priced and sold in greater numbers (nearly 4,000) albeit during a period which included several years of strong growth in the overall size of the German passenger car market.Oswald, pp 207 & 531 Sources and further reading * Oswald, Werner: Mercedes-Benz Personenwagen 1886‚Äì1986, Motorbuch-Verlag Stuttgart 1987, * This entry incorporates information from the equivalent German wikipedia entry. *1925 Mercedes 15/70/100 Typ 400 Category:Rear-wheel- drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:1920s cars ","title":"Mercedes 15/70/100 PS"},{"id":"37958152","text":"Vit√≥ria is an eagle () that is the mascot of Portuguese football club S.L.

The film was adapted from the 2002 novel of the same name written by Fauziah Ashari, published by Alaf 21. Plot Izzah (Maya Karin) and Hariz (Aaron Aziz) are from two different worlds and they have to face many hurdles before finding happiness. Izzah is a village girl who is sold by her uncle to an entertainment club in Kuala Lumpur to become a prostitute. Hariz is a young man who is the son of Madam Sufiah Hariz (Azizah Mahzan), the owner of the business empire 'Sufiah Catering'. He buys Izzah to be his mistress, but Izzah pleads with him to marry her instead to legalise their relationship. Hariz agrees to the terms, provided that Izzah not claim any rights as a wife. However, the rough and hot-tempered Hariz finds himself falling in love with Izzah who is full of tenderness. Their relationship is frowned upon by Madam Sufiah. Hariz is then forced to marry Mila Amylia (Lisa Surihani), a childhood friend and now a famous model and actress, after being pressured by his mother. When Hariz falls into a coma in the hospital due to a road accident, Madam Sufiah drives Izzah out of the bungalow and confiscates the car keys and mobile phones. Once out of the hospital, Madam Sufiah lies to Hariz about Izzah having forgotten about him and having a relationship with another man. She produces a photograph, apparently taken by a private detective, that shows Mail, Izzah's childhood friend, appearing intimate with Izzah (in actual fact, Izzah was helping Mail get a job in KL and had put him up at Pak Dolah's house). Hariz drives over to Pak Dolah's house and sees Mail and Izzah there, thereby confirming his mother's allegations. He gets angry at Izzah and tells her that he is leaving her. As he drives off in his car, Izzah chases him and falls. She starts to bleed, implying that she may be suffering a miscarriage. At the hospital, she and baby are found to be safe. Pak Dollah arrives at Hariz's home and confronts Madam Sufiah. Hariz learns of the secret pact that Pak Dolah and Madam Sufiah's husband had made many years ago. Hariz has been given up for adoption to Madam Sufiah and her husband. Hariz feels remorseful and misses Izzah who has gone to her village. He goes to her village to ask for forgiveness. Izzah readily accepts him. Mila appears at the village and after realising that Hariz and Izzah are very much in love, she asks Hariz to divorce her. The film ends with Izzah and Hariz leading a simple happy life together.

In addition, she also stated that she was not called on to be an advisor in the production of the script nor was she called to be the playwright of the film. But her statement was repulsed by Karangkraf Media Group Managing Director, Datuk Hussamuddin Yaacub. He stated that the process of adapting the novel to film scripts had been conducted since 2009. He also refuted the allegations that writers did not get adequate pay as he had given nearly RM 200,000 as royalty. Additionally, the author of the book will benefit from the increased revenue from the sales of the book due to the commercial success of the film.

Built in the 1820s, it has been named a historic site. Greenfield was founded by American Revolution veteran William Robinson Smith, a native of Pennsylvania, in 1812. Smith and his son Robert founded a tannery on the settlement's eastern edge, along Paint Creek, and built a vernacular building to house the business. After several years of operation, the tannery was taken over by William's oldest son Samuel M., who arranged for the destruction of the original building and the construction of the present house in its stead.

By the 20th century K√∂nigsberg had one of the larger Jewish communities within the German Reich. The city's Jewish community was eliminated by emigration and then The Holocaust during World War II. History Hugo Falkenheim, leader of K√∂nigsberg's Jews during World War II The first Jews in K√∂nigsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia) were the doctors Isaak May (1538) and Michel Abraham (1541) at the court of Albert, Duke of Prussia. In 1680Armstedt, p. 183Jolowicz, p. 21 or 1682M√ºhlpfordt, p. 150 Frederick William, the Great Elector, allowed the city's Jewish residents to rent space for prayer at the Eulenburgsches Haus (later Hotel Deutsches Haus) on Burgfreiheit's Kehrwiederstra√üe (later Theaterstra√üe). Most were merchants from the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. A permanent Jewish community began to develop in K√∂nigsberg only by 1704, when a Jewish cemetery was designated. Jewish students were first admitted to the University of K√∂nigsberg in 1712.Denny, p. 65 In 1750 Frederick II of Prussia issued an edict which classified Jews in Prussia into several categories. The main division was between so-called \\"tolerated Jews\\" (geduldete Juden) who could remain in Prussia, and \\"not tolerated Jews\\" who were required to leave upon reaching adulthood, as well as \\"protected Jews\\" (Schutz-Juden) . The \\"protected Jews\\", whose number was initially limited to a total of 203 families in all of Brandenburg-Prussia, were allowed to reside in a city but had no right of mobility. Non-protected \\"tolerated Jews\\", who comprised the vast majority of Jewish inhabitants of the Prussian kingdom, were not allowed to permanently settle in Prussia, were not allowed to purchase land or houses or to engage in any commercial or economic activity, and generally were not allowed to live in the cities unless they served as employees or clients of the \\"protected Jews\\".Mendelssohn, pp. 49-50 As a result, the Jewish population of K√∂nigsberg in the 18th century was fairly low, although this changed as the restrictions became relaxed over the course of the 19th century. In 1753 Frederick II allowed the city's Jews to build a Hasidic synagogue on Vordere Vorstadt's Schn√ºrlingsdamm, which was completed in 1756. Georg David Kypke served as its government inspector. In 1756 there were 29 families of \\"protected Jews\\" in K√∂nigsberg, which increased to 57 by 1789. The total number of Jewish inhabitants was less than 500 in the middle of the 18th century, and around 800 by the end of it, out of a total population of almost 60,000 people.Jasinski, p. 172 The city counted 300 Jewish residents in 1756, 900 residents in 1800, and 1,027 in 1817, with much of the increase coming from the Russian Empire. Although the first synagogue, the Alte Synagoge, burned down in 1811, it was rebuilt on nearby Synagogenstra√üe and dedicated in 1815. Jewish emancipation occurred in 1812 during the Prussian reforms, but Jews were largely restricted from officer and government professions. Full emancipation only occurred in 1869 through the North German Confederation. K√∂nigsberg's Jewish community flourished during the 19th century and early 20th century, peaking with a population of 5,000 by 1880.Albinus, p. 142 The first history of the city's Jews was written by Heymann Jolowicz in 1867.Gause II, p. 596 In 1893 the Adass Jisroel, an Orthodox branch, opened their own synagoge on Synagogenstra√üe near the Alte Synagoge. The Orthodox numbered only 25-30 families, but included influential bankers, merchants, and jewelers.Gause II, p. 700 The liberal Neue Synagoge (new synagogue) was built along Lindenstra√üe in Lomse from 1894 to 1896 to serve the majority of the Jewish population. A third group included the city's Polish and Lithuanian Jews. The number of Russians Jews increased in the late 19th century due to anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire. K√∂nigsberg's Jewish citizens were divided between Zionists and the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens.Gause II, p. 701 Many of K√∂nigsberg's Jews served during World War I. By 1917 there were 820 K√∂nigsberg Jews in the Prussian Army, including 80 volunteers. They included 15 recipients of the Iron Cross First Class and 102 recipients of the Iron Cross Second Class. Due to anti-Semitism and persecution in the 1920s and 1930s,Denny, p. 66 K√∂nigsberg's Jewish population was in decline by the time of the Nazi Party took control through the Machtergreifung in 1933. In that year there were only 3,500 Jews living in the city.Gause III, p. 146 Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany, enforced by Erich Koch, restricted business and led many K√∂nigsberg Jews to emigrate, mostly to the United States and Great Britain. Michael Wieck wrote of the discrimination he suffered from the Hitler Youth.Denny, p. 67 At the opening of the 1935 Ostmesse, Hjalmar Schacht criticized the persecution to no avail.Gause III, p. 147 Persecution led the Jewish community to create a separate Jewish school for 82 students in April 1935; it grew to encompass 180 students in 6 classes with 4 teachers by October 1935.Gause III, p. 148 In February 1938 the propaganda paper Der Student der Ostmark published the names of 201 Jewish business, 38 doctors, and 22 lawyers remaining in the city, which was used by the Sturmabteilung during the Night of Broken Glass in November 1938. The New Synagogue was burned down, the Orthodox Adass Jisroel synagogue and two cemeteries were vandalized; the Jewish school was attacked but reopened afterwards, as was the Orthodox synagogue, where Michael Wieck became Bar Mitzva in mid-1941. Many of the Jewish residents were shipped to Nazi concentration camps within Germany. There were only 1,585 Jews in the city in May 1939, after which emigration was prohibited. Prominent K√∂nigsberg Jews who committed suicide during World War II were the esteemed councilor Paul Stettiner, consul Felix Japha and his wife, and the doctor Lotte Gottschalk. Her uncle, politician Alfred Gottschalk, starved to death in 1942. The leader of the Jewish community, Hugo Falkenheim, was smuggled to safety. Those who remained in 1942 were shipped to concentration camps, including Theresienstadt in occupied Czechoslovakia, Kaiserwald in occupied Latvia, and camps in Minsk in occupied Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.Denny, p. 73 The lawyer Max Lichtenstein died at Theresienstadt, while the councilor Marta Harpf died at Auschwitz.Gause III, p. 149 Only a small number of K√∂nigsberg's Jews survived The Holocaust and World War II; the number of victims is unknown. Many remaining German Jews left K√∂nigsberg, then Kaliningrad, in April 1948.Among them Michael Wieck, who delivered a detailed report on the years between 1933 and 1948.Denny, p. 64 Today, a community of approximately 2000 Jews remains in the region,http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Kaliningrad-Jews-battle- circus-over-restoring-synagogue with the New Synagogue being rebuilt in the same location and as an exact replica of the building destroyed in 1938.

It covers alien races and other fictional creatures, but not specific characters. Individual characters are listed in separate articles. Note that some information on the page is taken from spin-off media. 0-9 The 456 The 456 served as the main antagonists during the third series of Torchwood. They are unnamed aliens with whom the government of the United Kingdom made a deal in 1965; the 456 extorted twelve children in return for a cure to an Earth-bound virus which was about to mutate. When asked for their species name by John Frobisher, they chose to use the frequency they were contacted with as their name. They seem to require (or at least prefer) a highly toxic atmosphere, and to be non- humanoid of form, possessing three insect like heads which appear to spew green slime whenever the creatures are aggravated or pressured. In \\"Day Four\\", parts of the 456 were briefly seen when a government operative entered its chamber with a portable video camera. It had three heads, which possessed mandibles. The rest of the body is trunklike, like a giant caterpillar. A swelling is briefly shown at the end of the creature. After the 456 return to Earth over forty years later, an ambassador of the species demanded that 10% of the world's children be given to the race as a gift, or else the entire human race would be destroyed. To ensure humanity would accept this deal, the 456 announced their arrival several days in advance by possessing and speaking through every pre-pubescent child on earth. A closer view of the visiting 456 specimen showed it had incorporated the bodies of human children into its own, the two being connected by four vine-like tentacles, because of an unnamed chemical pre-pubescents produce that the creatures use like a drug. According to the 456 themselves, such children 'feel no pain', and 'live long beyond their natural span'. The children do not appear to have physically grown, although they are wizened, perhaps mutated in some way, and appear to be aware of their surroundings and their own condition; they breathe using respirators. The 456 are responsible for the death of Ianto Jones when they release a deadly virus into a building where Ianto was present. They are eventually defeated when Jack Harkness manages to reverse the frequency of a previous transmission made by the 456 and turn it into a weapon against them, driving them away from Earth, although he is forced to sacrifice his grandson Stephen to use him as the source of the frequency broadcast in the first place. A Abzorbaloff Abzorbaloff, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience Alien creatures, nicknamed \\"Abzorbaloffs\\", that can absorb any living thing into its body by touch and then digest the organism; one said Ursula Blake \\"tasted like chicken\\". The faces of its prey are visible on its body and are fully conscious of their surroundings. They are from the planet Clom, the twin planet of Raxacoricofallapatorius, the home planet of the Slitheen family. An Abzorbalovian disguised itself as \\"Victor Kennedy\\" and infiltrated L.I.N.D.A ‚Äì a group of people trying to track down The Doctor ‚Äì although it planned to absorb the Doctor's knowledge. But Elton Pope broke its cane, which was a limitation field that kept its absorbing abilities under control. Without the protecting field, the Abzorbaloff was absorbed into the Earth. His latest appearance was in the Series 12 episode The Timeless Children in a flashback sequence Adipose The Adipose are aliens composed of living fat, featured in the episode \\"Partners in Crime\\" (2008). Their breeding world, Adipose 3, was lost, causing them to turn to \\"Miss Foster\\", or Matron Cofelia of the Five Straighten Classabindi Nursery Fleet, Intergalactic Class, to create a new generation. She formulated a drug that would cause human fat (adipose tissue) to morph by parthenogenesis into Adipose children. The process is generally harmless to the host beyond the loss of body fat; but in emergencies the process can be accelerated, converting the host's entire body, which is fatal to the host and produces ill and weak Adipose children. The Shadow Proclamation forbids seeding, or breeding aliens, on a level-5 planet such as Earth. Level 5 means pre-warp capabilities, as said in \\"Partners in Crime.\\" According to the \\"Captain Jack's Monster Files\\" webcast about the Adipose, the children have been made wards of the Shadow Proclamation, implying that the Adipose First Family have been sentenced for their crimes. In the parallel universe created in \\"Turn Left\\" (2008), the Adipose incident happened in America instead of the United Kingdom, as London was destroyed when the Titanic crashed into Buckingham Palace because of the absence of the Doctor (\\"Voyage of the Damned\\"). Over 60 million Americans (roughly 20% of the total population of the United States) were killed in this timeline as a result. In \\"The Stolen Earth\\" and \\"Journey's End\\" (2008), it is revealed that the breeding planet, Adipose 3, was one of the 27 planets relocated to the Medusa Cascade by the New Dalek Empire. After their defeat, Adipose 3 and the other planets were returned to their original positions. In \\"The End of Time\\" (2009‚Äì10), an Adipose is shown in a bar along with other aliens the Tenth Doctor had previously encountered. Five Adipose action figures were released as part of the first series 4 wave. Aggedor Aggedor is the Sacred Royal Beast of the planet Peladon, where its spirit is worshiped. The real creature upon which the legend is based is a large, hairy beast with a single horn. Hunted to near extinction, one Aggedor beast roamed the tunnels below the citadel and, at one stage, was used to judge prisoners who were cast into a pit to face the Judgement Of Aggedor (The Monster of Peladon, 1974). Alpha Centauri A hermaphroditic hexapod from Alpha Centauri which, being effectively genderless, is referred to as \\"it\\" as opposed to \\"he\\" or \\"she\\". It is tall, green, has one large blue eye, six arms, and a high-pitched voice; it wears a long yellow cape and walks with a nervous gait. It is prone to cowardice and hysterics. Arcateenian A translucent humanoid who possessed the body of a 19th-century prostitute named Mary was encountered in the episode \\"Greeks Bearing Gifts\\" (2006). She was a member of a race which communicated exclusively via telepathic pendants, and claimed to be a political exile, sent to Earth by a teleporter now in Torchwood's possession. At one point, \\"Mary\\" calls herself Philoctetes, in reference to his exile on Lemnos. She gave her telepathic necklace to Toshiko, and seduced her into letting her into Torchwood to regain the teleporter. On arriving on Earth in 1812, the alien killed her guard and possessed Mary. In this form she needed to consume human hearts to maintain the host's youth, taking one a year. \\"Mary\\" threatened Tosh in order to regain the teleporter and Jack exchanged it for Tosh. However, Jack had reprogrammed the coordinates, sending \\"Mary\\" into the center of the Sun instead of back to her homeworld. In The Sarah Jane Adventures story Invasion of the Bane (2007), Sarah Jane Smith helps an alien of the same race to find its way home. It is later revealed that this alien was a \\"Star Poet\\", from Arcateen V, who gave Sarah Jane a device via which she promised to help her with her poetry whenever she needs it. Mr Smith's Alien Files on the official The Sarah Jane Adventures website described her race as Butterfly People. The Butterfly People are also referenced in the novel Something in the Water (published March 2008) where they are called \\"Arcateenians\\". \\"Mary\\" possessed strength large enough to shatter human bones in a manner resembling a gunshot and could move at superhuman speeds, also possessing acute senses able to notice that there was something different about Jack. The Star Poet in The Sarah Jane Adventures was able to fly home with some assistance from Sarah Jane. \\"Mary's\\" opinions of her human form seemed to be mixed: she disliked watching people talk using conventional speech; which was considered archaic on her home world, but she said she liked the body which she found \\"so soft, so wicked\\". She also expressed a dim view of human nature, considering humans to be a race who inherently desired to invade others. A letter to Doctor Who Magazine noted \\"Mary\\"'s strong resemblance to Destrii, a companion from the magazine's Eighth Doctor comic strips. The magazine's editors concurred with the observation. Later, The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell specified that Destrii and Mary are from the same system. Destrii's home planet Oblivion along with Devos, Krant and Arcateen IV, V and VI form the Arcan system. The Arcateenians are mentioned in the audio book The White Wolf, when Ben remarks that the Arcateenians could have helped them get home. B Bane The Bane, in their natural form, are large tentacled aliens with one eye. They appear in Invasion of the Bane (2007) and Enemy of the Bane (2008). They exhibit some level of mind-reading abilities. Bane Mothers are particularly large, and are known to eat members of their young who fail them. They are able to appear human through the use of image translators. The Bane sought to enslave mankind by getting them addicted to the soft drink, Bubble Shock!, which contained an organic Bane secretion that would take control of its human host when activated. Mrs Wormwood headed the Bane's disguised human front and created the Archetype, Luke. Blathereen The Blathereen are a family of Raxacoricofallapatorians, that are sworn enemies of the criminal Slitheen family. Known to be a much calmer and law-abiding clan than the Slitheen, the Blathereen made an appearance in the novel, The Monsters Inside (2005). In The Gift (2009), A family of Slitheen-Blathereen, created by the marriage of a member of both Slitheen and Blathereen families, came to Earth and tricked Sarah Jane Smith into accepting a gift of the Raxacoricofallapatorian plant, Rakweed, which began to poison the Earth with deadly spores. The Slitheen-Blathereen had no interest in the Blathereen's law-abiding ways, and instead turned to the Slitheen's greed and need to make profit. After indulging on Rakweed, which was highly sensitive to sound, Mr Smith sounded an alarm which ultimately led to the Slitheen- Blathereen exploding. The Blessing In Torchwood: Miracle Day (2011), The Blessing is revealed to be an antipodal geological formation connected to the Earth's morphic field running from Shanghai and Buenos Aires. Captain Jack Harkness theorises that it may have been caused by the interaction of Racnoss Huon particles and Silurian hibernation matrixes, though its origins are unknown. The Families are unsure of whether or not to classify the Blessing as alive, though it is stated to have a degree of sentience. One of its features is that it has the ability to show approachings human the content of their own souls, which has caused some to commit suicide, others to find conviction. The Mother believed that this reaction was a result of the Blessing attempting to communicate with the human race. In \\"The Blood Line\\" (2011), it is revealed that the worldwide immortality investigated by Torchwood was a result of Jack's blood being introduced to The Blessing's morphic field. It is implied that this was a result of the Blessing interpreting The Families' interference as a threat, and the subsequent immortality being a gift of kindness to humanity. Jack and Rex Matheson (who has been infused with Jack's blood) manage to reset the Miracle through exposing it to Jack's (now mortal) blood at each end of the Blessing. But the Blessing does not reset everything back to the way it was and, perhaps as a result of the presence of Jack's blood, brings Rex back as also immortal. Blowfish An otherwise-unnamed humanoid bipedal alien blowfish features in \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\" (2008). The blowfish, played by Paul Kasey, holds part of Captain John Hart's puzzle box. It is possible that the blowfish was known to John. Overcome by Earth's pleasures, the blowfish takes cocaine, steals a sports car and takes a teenage girl hostage, only to attract the attention of Torchwood and the local media, thus leading to its eventual demise. A young blowfish appears in the episode \\"Fragments\\" (2008), in flashback sequences involving Captain Jack Harkness' first mission for the Torchwood Institute, during which Jack captures the fish for committing various crimes but is outraged when it is shot after being captured. A blowfish and two other fish-like creatures appear in the Torchwood Magazine short story The Book of Jahi. The blowfish has taken on the name Mr. Glee and has been operating as a crime boss in Cardiff for some time. The blowfish appeared in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\" (2010) as part of The Alliance formed to trap the Eleventh Doctor. An inanimate stored Blowfish appears in Hedgewick's World of Wonders in the series-seven episode, \\"Nightmare in Silver\\" (2013), visited by the Doctor and Clara Oswald. Boekind C Carrionite The Carrionites appear in \\"The Shakespeare Code\\" (2007), using the power of words and witchcraft to release their species from a prison. They reappeared, this time with the Sixth Doctor, in the audio drama The Carrionite Curse. Catkind \\"The Catkind\\" are felines in the future that have evolved into humanoids. They are capable of interbreeding with the humans of the future. The Catkind have hair-covered bodies, feline facial features and retractable claws. Their young resemble typical domestic kittens, with humanoid features emerging after ten months. In \\"New Earth\\" (2006), a group of Catkind called the Sisters of Plenitude ran a hospital near the city of New New York. In \\"Gridlock\\" (2007), a Cat Person, Thomas Kincade Brannigan, has a human wife and a litter of kittens. Their latest appearance was in the Series 12 episode The Timeless Children. In a flashback sequence. The Celestial Toymaker The Toymaker is a entity of the Doctor- who putted invisible while solving The Trilogic Game and making many games deadly for his opponent's and doesn‚Äôt like to lose. The Toymaker was mentioned in a Series 12 episode. . ‚ÄòThe Children of January‚Äô These creatures are referenced in Michael Feeney Callan‚Äôs The Children of January in February 1986. ‚ÄôThe Children of January‚Äô are a peaceful, yet poor race from the dawn of a parallel civilization that was abandoned. Chelonian The Chelonians are a race of cybernetic humanoid tortoises who have appeared in various spin-off novels. They are a war-like race from the planet Chelonia. They are hermaphroditic and lay eggs. Some of their cybernetic enhancements include X-ray vision and improved hearing. The first appearance of the Chelonians was in the Seventh Doctor Virgin New Adventures novel The Highest Science by Gareth Roberts. They returned in Zamper and also featured in the Fourth Doctor missing adventure The Well-Mannered War, as well as in the short stories The Hungry Bomb, Fegovy, and The Body Bank, all by Gareth Roberts and published in, respectively, the Doctor Who Magazine Yearbook 1995, the anthology Decalog 3: Consequences, and the Doctor Who Storybook 2008. They are also mentioned in the New Adventures books Oh No It Isn't! and Beyond the Sun, featuring Bernice Summerfield. River Song listed the Chelonians amongst the races with fleets orbiting Earth in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\". Chelonians consider humans to be parasites and often try to eliminate them. There is a pacifist faction, however, and at some point following the Doctor's recorded encounters with them, that faction took control and their society began devoting its energies to flower arrangement. Cryons Cryons appear to be an all female race (reproducing by parthenogenesis) who cannot exist at temperatures above zero degrees. They are tall, slim, pale and lean, with long fingers and fingernails and enlarged craniums covered with a whitish membrane. They move slowly and have echoing voices. The Cryons had advanced refrigeration technology, and lived peacefully in huge refrigerated cities until they came to the attention of the Cybermen who attempted to wipe out the Cryons in order to steal their refrigerated habitats. Unknown to the Cybermen some Cryons survived. They kept a secret base under Cyber-Control but it is unclear whether or not they survived Control's destruction. Cyberman The original Cybermen were a race of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas. As they implanted more and more artificial parts into their bodies as a means of self- preservation, they became coldly logical and calculating, with emotion all but deleted from their minds. The Cybermen also have a rivalry with the Daleks. In the two-part story \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" and \\"The Age of Steel\\" of the second revived series (2006), the Cybermen originate on a parallel-universe version of Earth, where they were created by John Lumic, a genius obsessed with immortality. He forcibly 'upgraded' vast numbers of people in the parallel earth before a counter-revolution, initiated by the Tenth Doctor, started fighting back. The Cyberman concept was created by Dr. Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and Gerry Davis in 1966. Their first appearance was in the serial The Tenth Planet. They have since been featured numerous times in their efforts to conquer and convert humanity to cyborgs like themselves. Cybermat Cybershade Cybershades are a sub-species of Cybermen, except instead of a human being upgraded, the brains of cats and dogs are placed in a bronze-coloured metal head casing, with a black, furry humanoid body. They behave in a wild and feral manner, and were formidably agile, with the ability to climb buildings and jump from great heights. They first appeared in the 2008 Christmas special, \\"The Next Doctor\\", under the control of Miss. Mercy Hartigan as the CyberKing. D D√¶mon A race of humanoids from the planet D√¶mos. Their appearance is that of classic demons, because Earth's notion of demons derives from them. They are not exactly evil, but have a morality much different from humans, and have no qualms about doing humans harm. Dalek A war-like race of mutant creatures who live within mobile battle armor. They are life-long enemies of The Doctor, and he is the only being whom they fear. They are bent on destroying all life forms in the universe other than themselves. The creatures themselves resemble squid, with a single eye, exposed brain and many tentacles. They first appeared in the 1963 serial The Daleks, the second Doctor Who serial. Dalek Puppet A Dalek puppet is a living or dead creature that has been partially converted into a Dalek by Dalek Nanogenes. Puppets normally retain their original appearance but, in humanoids, when activated can extrude a miniature Dalek eyestalk and gunstick‚Äîin; the eyestalk coming from the forehead and the gunstick from the hand. If needed, the subject's pre-puppet memories can be accessed. Victims can be brought back to their senses by repeated insults to their character, such as the Doctor gave Tasha Lem. Time Lords cannot be converted into Dalek puppets. Demon Demons have appeared in Doctor Who several times, the first being in Third Doctor serial The D√¶mons (1971); there, they were specifically aliens from the planet D√¶mos who had come to Earth in the distant past, with their existence becoming ingrained in myth. The \\"demon\\" Azal was summoned by The Master's will for ill purposes that the Doctor, with the literally vital aid of Jo Grant, was able to block. In 2006, both the Tenth Doctor series of Doctor Who and its spin-off Torchwood expanded on the possibility of actual malicious supernatural entities existing in the Doctor Who universe. \\"The Impossible Planet\\" introduced the Beast, a Satan-like demon remaining from the universe before our own, sealed in planet Krop Tor by the \\"Disciples of Light\\". Later, in the Torchwood episode \\"End of Days\\"', the villainous Bilis Manger freed \\"Abaddon, son of the great Beast\\" from within the Rift, where he, like the Beast, had been imprisoned since \\"before time\\". Manger had schemed to ensure Abaddon's freedom, manipulating the Torchwood Three crew. Bilis refers to Abaddon as his \\"god\\". Abaddon killed all those who fell in his shadow; he devoured life. Captain Jack Harkness attempted to sacrifice himself by using his immortality to destroy the demon when it tried to absorb too much, leaving Jack dead for days but causing the monster to choke to death. It is also referred to in the second revived series (2006) of Doctor Who by the Ood in the episode \\"The Impossible Planet\\" in terms of the Beast's various aliases: \\"Some may call it Abaddon.\\" Dominator Draconian The Draconians (also called Dragons, a derogatory term) are a humanoid race encountered in the 26th century. They have tall, pointed heads with prominent brows, pointed ears, and patches of scaly skin. Common interstellar travel and attempts at colonization have brought them into frequent and occasionally hostile contact with humans, leading to a treaty establishing a frontier between the two empires. The Draconians are very intelligent, honorable, and at least as advanced as their human counterparts. They have appeared only in the Third Doctor serial Frontier in Space (1973). The Doctor mentioned that he arm wrestled with one at some point. Dwarf Mordant  Dwarf Mordant is an alien from a race known as the Salakans, a race that is interested to be the top salesman throughout the galaxy. According to Wally K. Daly‚Äôs Doctor Who The Ultimate Evil, Mordant tries to be the top salesman by being in an arms deal with building a hate ray in space and with the help of Escoval to break the rules of the First Families and open the Armory to start a war. But surrenders under the Doctor's condition to leave the planet and shut down his hate ray for peace and trade somewhere else. Drahvin E Eknodine The Eminence The Eminence is a gestalt entity which exists as a brown gas which suffocates humanoid life forms before possessing them and turning them into deathless footsoldiers for its army. Its first appearance was in the Sixth Doctor Audio Adventure, The Seeds of War. It has since been present throughout the Dark Eyes series featuring the Eighth Doctor, which explored its origin and final defeat after the Doctor was forced to ally with the Daleks, and has featured in the Fourth Doctor audio play episode Destroy the Infinite (which served as a prequel to Seeds). F Fendahl A race that never exceeds unlucky number 13; it is composed of one Golden Core and 12 Fendahleen. The Fendahl arose on the original fifth planet of our solar system, which they eventually wiped of all other life; so dangerous were they that the Time Lords moved the planet into a time loop. Somehow, though, the Fendahl managed to eject a skull, which passed through space (seriously harming life on Mars as it passed) to land on Earth, where its powers helped shape humanity, a new vessel for the Fendahl. Ages later, that skull was found by scientists, who believed it could grant them power; the attempt unfortunately backfired in the creation of a new Golden Core. The Core began creating Fendahleen, but one person committed suicide, preventing the Fendahl from reaching the quota. The Fourth Doctor blew up the house the Fendahl were in, and later tossed the skull that caused the trouble into a supernova. The Fendahl also appear in the Doctor Who novel The Taking of Planet 5, when a group of Time Lords from the Future War (a war that the Eighth Doctor had learned would be waged between the Time Lords and an unknown Enemy in his personal future, distinct from the Time War of the modern series) attempted to break the time lock around Planet Five to unleash the Fendahl to use it as a weapon in the war, only to unleash a creature described as the Maemeovore, a devourer of concept that had evolved to prey on the Fendahl itself as time inside the lock was accelerated, the Doctor only just managing to banish the Maemeovore out of the universe. They returned in the Torchwood audio, Night of the Fendahl and the Eighth Doctor Adventures audio, Island of the Fendahl, both released in 2019. Fenric Fenric is a alien possesser, ancient evil entity while he took upon many Vikings in which legend says, he was from a species called ‚Äòthe Great One‚Äô and took upon many game challenges to destroy a planet for revenge. Fisher King An alien warlord that once conquered Tivoli and possesses the ability to turn living beings into ghosts, the Fisher King was tricked by the Twelfth Doctor into believing that he had been turned into a ghost, which was a decoy in order for the Fisher King to be killed in an oncoming flood. Foamasi The Foamasi are an intelligent, bipedal race of reptiles resembling humanoid chameleons; they appeared in the 1980 Fourth Doctor story The Leisure Hive, by David Fisher. The race's name is a near-anagram of the word \\"mafioso\\". The Foamasi fought and won a 20-minute nuclear war with the Argolin. They communicate by means of chirps and clicks, translated by an interpreting device held in the mouth. Although they became mostly a peaceful race from having learned the error of their ways from the devastating war, a renegade faction called the West Lodge exists and frequently attempts to revive hostilities between the two races. After their victory, the Argolin's home planet of Argolis was officially owned by the Foamasi government. Two saboteurs from the West Lodge tried to force the Argolins to sell them the Leisure Hive, so they could use it as a new base. They were thwarted by a group of Foamasi, one claiming to be a member of the Foamasi government, who used a web-spewing gun to ensnare them and return them to their home planet. Some Foamasi disguise themselves as humanoids by fitting into skin-suits which are smaller than the Foamasi's own bodies. A Foamasi assassin appears in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel Placebo Effect by Gary Russell. In this novel, it is explained that the Foamasi can fit into disguises smaller than their bodies because their bones are hollow and collapsible. Futurekind A cannibalistic humanoid species with sharp teeth and warrior-like markings over their faces, the Futurekind are believed to be what humans will become at the very end of the universe. They hunt weaker humans in large packs, and use fire torches as a way of intimidating their prey. They only encountered the Tenth Doctor and his companions, Martha Jones and Captain Jack Harkness, in \\"Utopia\\" (2007), when the TARDIS inadvertently took them to the very end of the universe. G Gelth The Gelth appeared in the Ninth Doctor episode \\"The Unquiet Dead\\" (2005). They were a new race of alien villains that the Doctor and Rose Tyler encountered in the 2005 revived series. They were the first element of the new series that attracted attention for being \\"too scary\\". Following complaints, many of which were made by Mediawatch UK, the BBC stated that in future, episodes of that nature would be forewarned by a statement of \\"may not be suitable for under 8s\\". The Gelth were blue gaseous life-forms. They claimed to have lost their corporeal forms as a consequence of the Last Great Time War, though later actions by the Gelth put the truth of this statement in doubt. They arrived on Earth via the Spacetime Rift at an undertaker's house in Cardiff in 1869. Their forms could not be maintained in Earth's atmosphere without suspension in a gaseous medium, so they inhabited the gas pipes common to Victorian era households. Further, though, they also would take possession of recently deceased corpses. When possessing corpses, they look much like ordinary humans (provided that the corpse has yet to enter the autolytic stage of decomposition), with only two fundamental differences: their irises vanish or turn white, and blue veins are clearly visible on their ghastly pale skin. Gelth make an unearthly shrieking noise for an unknown reason, particularly when they've possessed someone. Claiming to be on the verge of extinction, the Gelth convinced the Doctor to aid their entrance to Earth via Gwyneth, the undertaker's servant girl, who had developed psychic powers due to growing up near the Rift. The Gelth actually numbered in the billions and intended to take the Earth by force, and to use its murdered population as vessels for themselves. The Gelth were thwarted when Gwyneth sacrificed herself, blowing up the building and sealing the Rift. Whether all the Gelth that came through the rift perished is unclear. In \\"Army of Ghosts\\" (2006), Rose asked whether \\"ghostshifting\\" Cybermen might have been Gelth, which the Tenth Doctor stated was not the case. In \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\" (2008), Donna Noble compared Agatha Christie being surrounded by murders to meeting Charles Dickens at Christmas while he's surrounded by ghosts. The Doctor gave a \\"Well...\\" to a disbelieving Donna; Dickens was with his previous incarnation and Rose when the Gelth attempted to attack at Christmas, and the gaseous form of the Gelth could lead to their being classed \\"ghosts\\". Graske A Graske is a member of a race of diminutive aliens from the planet Griffoth. They can transmat through time and space to abduct individuals out of their own time and replacing them with a Graske. Disguised Graske can be identified by a green glow that sometimes appears in their eyes. They first appeared (in the form of an unnamed Graske) in the interactive short Doctor Who episode Attack of the Graske (2005). Krislok, a Graske, played by Jimmy Vee, appeared in The Sarah Jane Adventures episodes Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane? (2007) and The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith (2008). A henchman and slave of the Trickster, who the latter saved from death, Krislok later gained his freedom. An unnamed Graske appear in the Proms special episode \\"Music of the Spheres\\" (2008) and in a space bar scene in \\"The End of Time\\" (2009‚Äì10). Great Intelligence Groske Groske look like Graske but are blue; they also talk like the Graske. They first appeared in Death of the Doctor (2010), where they were seen working for UNIT. One of the Groske saves Clyde Langer, Rani Chandra, and Santiago Jones from the villainous vulture-like Shansheeth. Groske can detect artron energy (claiming it \\"smells\\"), and they dislike the Graske. Guardian The two powerful entities in charge of keeping balance in the universe. Neither may become directly involved in the affairs of the universe, but either may choose agents to do his bidding (the White Guardian chose the Doctor, while the Black Guardian chose the Shadow and Vislor Turlough). Spin- off media has revealed that there are six Guardians overall; White, Black, Crystal, Red, Bronze and Gold, with the other four representing Dreams, Justice, Equilibrium and Life respectively. The novel Divided Loyalties identifies the Doctor's old foe the Celestial Toymaker as the Crystal Guardian of Dreams, but the other three have not explicitly appeared in any media yet.

Life He was born in Limerick. After seven years in Rome, under the guidance of Ignatius Loyola and Francis Borgia, he entered the Society of Jesus about 1550, and became rector of the college at Modena. About August 1560 Wolfe returned to Ireland, with the powers of an apostolic legate. He was instructed to regulate public worship, and to keep up communication with the Catholic princes. He attracted the attention of the English officials and in 1561 Elizabeth I of England stated to Pope Pius IV, as one of her reasons for not sending representatives to the Council of Trent, that Wolfe had been sent to excite disaffection. For several years he was unable to enter The Pale, and on 7 December 1563 he delegated his jurisdiction for Dublin and its vicinity to Thady Newman. In 1564 the Pope, by a bull dated 31 May, entrusted to Wolfe and Richard Creagh the erection of universities and schools in Ireland. In the early 1560s Wolfe sent a number of Irish Catholic clerics to Rome. About 1566 he was arrested and imprisoned in Dublin Castle. In 1572 his release was paid for by a merchant, acting indirectly for Portuguese Jesuits. Wolfe went to Spain, but returned again to Ireland. On 14 April 1577 Sir William Drury informed Francis Walsingham that Wolfe was to be sent to the Indies. On 24 March 1578 Drury informed the privy council that James Fitzmaurice had put to sea with Wolfe, and had captured an English ship, whose crew had been handed over to the Inquisition. But the end of Wolfe's life is obscure. He was in dispute with the Portuguese Jesuits who had arranged for his release. He also had to leave the Society of Jesus. On 28 June 1578 Everard Mercurian, the General of the Jesuits, wrote to James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald, whose chaplain Wolfe had been at one time, stating that he would be glad of employment for Wolfe. It is assumed that Wolfe died within a year, since records of him end.

They signed to Deathwish Inc. in 2011 and released their debut album You, Me & the Violence in 2012. History Birds in Row formed in Laval, Mayenne in 2009. Two of the members formed Birds in Row one week after their previous band split up, and recorded their first song one week later. The group chose the name because birds are able to fly around freely, however, \\"they very often decide to fly as a group or land on wires in a row. So, this for us represents how people could chose to be free, but always end up following their fellows to feel comfortable.\\" They chose the name 'Birds in Row' over 'Birds in a Row' because it sounded better to the group. They also chose to sing in English because they, \\"wanted to be understood by most of the people.\\" The band's earliest releases include 2009's Rise of the Phoenix and 2010's Cottbus, two EPs released through Vitriol Records. Birds in Row had begun writing their debut album in late 2011. Deathwish Inc. showed interest in reissuing their Cottbus EP, but the band offered the album they had been working on the time instead. Birds in Row's signing was announced in November 2011, and they finished recording their debut album by January 2012. Also in January 2012, Vitriol reissued the group's early EPs as a compilation titled Collected. Birds in Row toured the United States with Loma Prieta in March 2012 and with Touch√© Amor√©, Defeater and Code Orange Kids in April 2013. A music video for the song \\"Pilori\\" was released in June 2012, and Birds in Row's debut album You, Me & the Violence was released on September 4, 2012. Also in 2012, the band toured Europe with Converge and Rise and Fall in August, and the UK in December. In July 2013 they appeared at Fluff Fest in Czechia for the first time, returning in 2015 and 2017. Along with Glass Cloud and Rebuker, Birds in Row opened for the Chariot during their final tour in October/November 2013. In 2014, the Birds in Row posted a Facebook update explaining that the band had broken up, only to delete the post shortly after leading to confusion about the state of the band. They released a follow-up statement that explained Birds in Row was going through some changes and had not broken up. Birds in Row later elaborated that the band was going through a \\"pretty brutal\\" line-up change. Citing both an interest in learning to perform together with the new line-up and wanting to pay tribute to the people and labels who helped them achieve their level of success, the band decided to release a series of EPs and split releases in lieu of full-length follow-up to You, Me & the Violence. Among these releases includes the EP Personal War to be released through Deathwish and a split release with WAITC ‚Äî who are also from Laval, France ‚Äî to be released through the French label Throatruiner Records. The band will release its second full-length studio album titled We Already Lost the World through Deathwish on July 13, 2018. Coinciding with the album's official announcement in May 2018, the band released a lyric video for the track \\"15-38\\" online. Fred Pessaro of Revolver noted the track was a departure from the band's earlier material and that it was a \\"slow-burn emotional offering that grows deeper and darker as it progresses, eventually opening back up into the brand of that the trio is most associated with.\\" Birds in Row concert in January 2010 Members and identity Birds in Row is a three-piece band with a guitarist/vocalist, a bassist and a drummer. The faces of the members are intentionally cropped out of promotional photographs and music videos, and the original individual members were usually only referred to by the single letter initials: B, D or T. Birds in Row consciously make this effort in order to appear as a single entity rather than three individuals. The band commented, \\"It's not about some individuals, but songs, ideas, points of view that our three lives have in common. So as we've been asked for promo pics for several reasons, we decided to crop them so all you can see is a band.\\" In 2014, the band went through a lineup change and D was replaced by Q.

His first role was in Buster Keaton's 1926 film, The General, before appearing in two 1927 Our Gang/Little Rascals silent shorts: The Glorious Fourth and Olympic Games. He had what was characterized as a breakout performance in the 1929 William Wyler-directed part-talkie The Shakedown, co- starring James Murray and Barbara Kent. He also had minor roles in Romance, where as an uncredited extra he got his first on-screen kiss from Greta Garbo. Between 1930 and 1933, Hanlon appeared in eight more films before giving up his acting career in 1932. After graduating from high school, he played minor league baseball and served as an Army Air Corps paratrooper during World War II.

Life  Zareh Vorpouni was born Zareh Euksuzian in Ordu, a city in Turkey on the southeastern shore of the Black Sea. He received his early education at the local Movsesian school. His father was killed during the 1915 Armenian genocide, but his mother managed to flee to Sevastopol, Crimea, with her four children, Zareh, Nourhan, Melanoush and Garabed. After a year the family moved to Constantinople, where Zareh attended (1919‚Äì22) the Berberian school, and in 1922 they moved to France. They lived in Marseille for two years, then in Paris (1924‚Äì30) and Strasbourg (1930-37). From his early days in France Zareh was an avid reader, acquainting himself with European intellectual trends and prominent works of French literature, particularly those of Marcel Proust.  Literary Activity  Vorpuni belonged to the group of promising young Armenian intellectuals-among them Nigoghos Sarafian, Vazken Shushanian, Shahan Shahnur, and Hrach Zartarian: mostly orphans of the Armenian genocide-who emigrated to France in the early 1920s and produced literature that derived its themes from the social, cultural, moral, and psychological distresses of the emigres and their deep concerns about the eventual loss of their ethnic identity. In Paris he and Bedros Zaroyan jointly edited two short-lived periodicals, Nor Havadk (New Faith, 1924) and Lusapats (Daybreak, 1938‚Äì39). In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, he was called up for service in the French army. He was captured and held prisoner of war in Germany until the end of the war in 1945. Recollections of his prison days appear in a cycle of ten short stories called I Khorots Srdi (From the bottom of my heart). His first novel, Portse (The Attempt, 1929) depicts the hard life of an Armenian immigrant family of four plucked out of their native land and transplanted to Marseilles, where they suffer the impact of a totally strange environment. Portse is the first volume of a quartet, intended by the author to be published under the collective title Haladzvadznere (The Persecuted). However, the succeeding three volumes - Tegnadzun (The candidate, 1967), Asfalte (Asphalt, 1972), and Sovoragan or me (An ordinary day, 1974) were not published until much later. In Tegnadzun the main character, Vahakn, embodies the tormented young generation that bore the psychological trauma of the Armenian genocide and remained its victims, leaving a moral legacy to the entire nation. In the other two volumes the author delves more deeply into the psychology of his characters, probing the sources of their anguish. However, almost all his characters, no matter how battered, are firmly determined to survive. Of primary significance among Vorpuni's writing are his three volumes of short stories, Vartsu Senyag (Room for rent, 1946), Antsrevod orer (Rainy days, 1958), and Badmvadzkner (Stories, 1966). In these tales he bares the hidden emotions and mental anguish of his characters and deplores the disintegration of the Armenian identity as it gradually becomes a burden for the new generation. The subtle presence of the Armenian genocide is felt through these narratives. In 1946 Vorpuni visited Soviet Armenia and recorded his impressions in Tebi Yergir, Husher Hayreniki n Hayreniken (Memories from the homeland, 1947). Another important work is the novel Yev yeghev mart (And there was man, 1965). The title was later reused for a collection of his works published in Yerevan in 1967 that includes Portse, Yev yeghev mard, and other short stories.  Translation  Zareh Vorpouni's first work to appear in English translation is The Candidate: A Novel, translated by Jennifer Manoukian and Ishkhan Jinbashian (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2016). In the translator's introduction, Manoukian writes, \\"From this footnote has emerged a translation that resists, much like in the spirit of the original. It resists the isolation and insularity of literature written in a minority language; it resists the idea that culture in diaspora is fossilized, stagnant, or in decline; and it resists the notion that Armenians have only their century-old plight to offer the world outside their national cocoon.\\" Vorpouni was also featured in the April 2020 issue of Asymptote in which Manoukian explores his use of the \\"new novel.\\" References Category:1902 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Armenian- language writers Category:French male novelists Category:Armenians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Armenian Genocide survivors Category:People from Ordu Category:20th-century novelists Category:20th-century French novelists Category:20th-century French male writers Category:Ottoman emigrants to France Category:French military personnel of World War II Category:French prisoners of war in World War II Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany ","title":"Zareh Vorpuni"},{"id":"37958718","text":"Anjirak (, also Romanized as Anjƒ´rak; also known as Injƒ´lak) is a village in Amanabad Rural District, in the Central District of Arak County, Markazi Province, Iran.

Production continued until 1929 by which time Daimler had merged with Benz & Cie (effective 1926) as a result of which the car's name had changed to Mercedes-Benz Typ 630.Oswald, pp 206 & 215 The car was conceptually and structurally similar to the contemporary Mercedes 15/70/100 PS, but the 24/100/140 PS was longer, heavier, more powerful, faster and more expensive. A still more powerful Mercedes-Benz Modell K sports car version, sometimes known as the Mercedes-Benz 24/110/160 PS, was offered between 1926 and 1929. A defining feature of the cars was the switchable supercharger (‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù) fitted to the engine. Origins Plans for the car were drawn up by the company's Technical Director, Paul Daimler, son of the company's founder. Following an acrimonious disagreement about new model policy, Daimler left in 1922, transferring to rival manufacturer Horch. It was left to Daimler's successor, Technical Director Ferdinand Porsche, arriving at the plant from Austria in April 1923, to complete the development and handle the launch of the 24/100/140 PS. The strategy for the model's development, which used knowledge gained on the race track from the company's successful racing cars to develop a large, fast, and very expensive road car, appears to have been similar under both men.Oswald, p 214  Naming conventions and horsepower  By the car's launch year of 1924 Daimler had already for many years been branding their cars with the name ‚ÄúMercedes‚Äù. Otherwise the manufacturer applied the widely followed German naming conventions of the time. On the Mercedes 24/100/140 PS the ‚Äú24‚Äù defined the car's tax horsepower, used by the authorities to determine the level of annual car tax to be imposed on car owners. The ‚Äú100‚Äù and the ‚Äú140‚Äù both defined the manufacturer's claims regarding car's actual power output as defined in metric horsepower. In Germany tax horsepower, which had been defined by statute since 1906, was based on the dimensions of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the cylinder stroke, and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower. The unusual feature in the naming of this car was the inclusion of two different power output figures. This arose from the fitting to the engine of a switchable supercharger (‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù). In normal operation maximum claimed output was . With the supercharger invoked this rose to . The 24/100/140 PS was one of two Daimler models to survive the fusion of Daimler with Benz & Cie signed in 1924 that came into effect in 1926. However, cars of the newly merged company were now branded ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz‚Äù and the model also acquired the new model name ‚ÄúTyp 630‚Äù, being now known as the Mercedes-Benz Typ 630 The alternative name Mercedes-Benz 24/100/140 PS was and is also sometimes used.  The car   Bodies  Many buyers purchased the car in bare chassis form and acquired bodywork separately from an independent coach builder. Early adopters of the Mercedes 24/100/140 PS included the then-octogenarian Reichspr√§sident Paul von Hindenburg, whose 1929 presidential Type 630 featured a Pullman-Landaulet body by coachbuilders Jos.Neuss of Berlin.Oswald, p 216 Among the manufacturer's listed body types were a four or (from 1925) six seater Torpedo bodied ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù, a six-seater ‚ÄùPullman-Limousine‚Äù, a six- seater ‚ÄúLandaulet‚Äù, a six-seater ‚ÄúCoupe-Limousine‚Äù and a 4-door four seater Cabriolet.Oswald, p 215 The engine  The six cylinder in-line 6240 cc engine featured an overhead camshaft which at the time was an unusual feature, with ‚Äúbevel linkage‚Äù. However, it was the switchable supercharger (‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù), adopted from the company's racing cars, that attracted most of the attention. With the device switched off maximum claimed output was of at 3,100 rpm: with the supercharger operating, maximum output rose to . The top speed listed was 115 km/h (71 mph) or 120 km/h (75 mph) according to which of the two offered final drive ratios was fitted. Chassis and running gear  Power was transmitted to the rear wheels via a multi-plate dry disc clutch (‚ÄúMehrscheibentrockenkupplung‚Äù) and a four speed manual transmission. The gear lever was initially to the driver's right, directly outside the door, but at some stage it was repositioned to what has subsequently become a more conventional location in the middle of the floor to the driver's left.Oswald, p 215 (At this time it was still normal in western Europe for the steering wheel and therefore also the driver to be placed on the right side of the car.) The suspension configuration followed the conventions of the time, using rigid beam axles and semi-elliptic leaf springs. Braking operated on all four wheels using a cable linkage.  Evolution  The car changed very little during its production life. The name change to Mercedes-Benz Typ 630 which followed the Daimler/Benz fusion was not accompanied by any changes to the car. However, in 1927 the centre of gravity was lowered as a result of a switch to an underslung chassis which left the axles directly above the longitudinal chassis members, whereas earlier car had applied the ‚ÄúHochbett‚Äù overslung chassis layout whereby the longitudinal chassis members were attached directly above the axles. In 1928 the effectiveness of the brakes was increased through the addition of a vacuum powered support (‚ÄúSaugluftunterst√ºtzung‚Äù). In 1929 it became possible to specify in the Mercedes-Benz Typ 630 the high performance / to engine which, since 1928, had been available only on the sports car bodied Mercedes-Benz Modell K.Oswald, p 215 The extra price for the ‚ÄúBlower‚Äù version was 2,000 Marks, equivalent to approximately 8% of the total price for a car with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Typ 630 engine. High performance specials 1926 Modell K At the same time as the newly renamed \\"Typ 630\\" appeared, in 1926, the manufacturer introduced the Mercedes- Benz Modell K which used the same engine and the same overall chassis architecture, except that the wheelbase was shortened by to . The \\"K\\" stands for \\"kurzer Radstand\\" (short wheelbase), This car was available as a four-door ‚ÄúSports four seater‚Äù or as a two-door ‚ÄúRoadster‚Äù. From the right side of the bonnet/hood emerged three stout metal pipes carrying the car's exhaust gases, merging at the lower edge of the bonnet/hood into a large single exhaust pipe. This detail later became a hallmark of Mercedes-Benz ‚ÄùKompressor‚Äù cars. The top speed of the sports car was listed as 145 km/h (90 mph). From 1928 the Modell K received a still more powerful \\"Kompressor engine\\", although there was no change to the overall engine size. Stated power now increased to or, with the compressor switched on, . The official performance figures were unchanged.  Commercial  Production data are not available for the car's early years, but following the merger which created ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz‚Äù 377 of the 630Ks were produced, broken down across the four years between 1926 and 1929 as 12 cars, 44 cars, 299 cars and 22 cars. In addition the manufacturer produced 267 high performance ‚ÄúModell K‚Äù (24/110/160 PS) versions.Oswald, p 207  Replacement  The replacement for the ‚ÄúLimousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon) bodied Mercedes-Benz Typ 630 was the even larger and more powerful Mercedes- Benz Typ 770 (W07). The sports car bodied cars were replaced by the ferociously fast Mercedes-Benz SS and SSK (Typ 06) which had commenced production, albeit in very small numbers, in 1928.Oswald, p 207 Sources and further reading * Oswald, Werner: Mercedes-Benz Personenwagen 1886‚Äì1986, Motorbuch-Verlag Stuttgart 1987, * This entry incorporates information from the equivalent German wikipedia entry.

The model results in a strategy's exposures to asset classes or other factors, interpreted as a measure of a fund or portfolio manager's style. While the model is most frequently used to show an equity mutual fund‚Äôs style with reference to common style axes (such as large/small and value/growth), recent applications have extended the model‚Äôs utility to model more complex strategies, such as those employed by hedge funds. Returns based strategies that use factors such as momentum signals (e.g., 52-week high) have been popular to the extent that industry analysts incorporate their use in their Buy/Sell recommendations. History William F. Sharpe first presented the model in his 1988 article ‚ÄúDetermining a Fund‚Äôs Effective Asset Mix‚Äù. Under the name RBSA, this model was made available in commercial software soon after and retains a consistent presence in mutual fund analysis reporting. As the investment community has expanded beyond security selection to the embrace of asset allocation as the critical driver of performance, additional papers and studies further supported the concept of using RBSA in conjunction with holdings-based analysis. In 1995, the paper 'Determinants of Portfolio Performance' by Gary Brinson, L. Randolph Hood, and Gilbert L. Beebower, demonstrated that asset allocation decisions accounted for greater than 90% of the variability in a portfolio's performance.http://www.multnomahgroup.com/resources/white-papers/returns- based-style-analysis-the-preferred-methodology Concept RBSA uses the capital asset pricing model as its backbone, of which William Sharpe was also a primary contributor. In CAPM, a single index is often used as a proxy to represent the return of the market. The first step is to extend this to allow for multiple market proxy indices, thus: : R_t^m=\\\\alpha+\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^I\\\\beta^iR_t^i+\\\\epsilon_t where: * R_t^m is the time stream of historical manager returns, * R_t^i is a set of time streams of market indices or factors, * I is the number of indices or factors used in analysis, * \\\\alpha is the intercept of the regression equation, often interpreted as manager skill, * \\\\epsilon_t is the error, to be minimized using ordinary least squares regression. The beta coefficients are interpreted as exposures to the types of market returns represented by each chosen index. Since these exposures theoretically represent percentages of a replicating portfolio, we often apply the following constraints: : \\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^I\\\\beta_i=1;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\beta_i>0\\\\;\\\\;\\\\forall i. These constraints may be relaxed to allow for shorting, or if factors rather than indices are used; this modification brings the model closer to arbitrage pricing theory than to the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The second improvement upon the simple CAPM construct suggested by Sharpe was to apply the model to rolling time intervals. Data during these intervals is exponentially weighted to increase the importance of data collected more recently. This addition allows for the alpha and beta coefficients to change over the historic period used in the analysis, an expected property of active management. Application Application of the model involves repeated regressions over overlapping windows to compute an alpha and vector of betas for each, resulting in a statistical picture of a manager's style. Since 1992, this computation has been a feature of mutual fund analysis software produced by companies such as LIPPER, MPI, Zephyr Associates, and Morningstar. The exposures calculated by RBSA software can provide various pictures of a fund's evolution, both in isolation and in comparison to similar strategies. This analysis is usually done to better understand a fund over an explicitly chosen period of time. Since Sharpe's original formulation of the model, additional research and development has added to RBSA. A widely accepted addition has been the use of a centered window for historical periods. For example, a 36-month window calculating the exposures for January 2002 would reference data 18 months before and 18 months after, spanning the interval from July 2000 through June 2003. This provides for more accurate historical analysis and addresses a lag in the model's detection of style changes. However, this modification has been criticized for being unrealistic, since a centered window cannot be applied to today's return without knowing the future. The increased accuracy has usually been deemed worth the loss of generality. Other generalizations to the model have been developed to do away with the fixed window constraint, such as models that employ Kalman filters to allow for more general time dilation. These methods still require assumed restrictions on the evolution of exposures, such as a return to normality assumption, or a fixed turnover parameter such as in Dynamic Style Analysis. These models are usually considered separate from classically defined ‚ÄòRBSA‚Äô, though they continue to analyze style based on returns. Comparison with holdings-based analysis Similar information describing a fund's investment style can be aggregated by comprehensive analysis of a fund's holdings. Returns-based analysis, which assesses the behavior of an investment vehicle versus known investment products (i.e., indices) is intended to be used in a complementary fashion with holdings-based analysis, which analyzes an investment vehicle by reviewing the actual underlying securities, funds and other instruments or portfolios that comprise the vehicle. For example, consider a mutual fund that holds ten 'large value' US stocks. Returns-based analysis would analyze the returns of the fund itself, and by comparing them to US equity indices, may determine that the fund is heavily exposed to the large-growth space. Holdings-based analysis would examine the fund's stated holdings, and provide the names and percentages of the stocks in question. Given that returns-based analysis is based on historical returns, it is used to comment on overall fund or portfolio behavior, whereas holdings-based analysis focuses entirely on the composition of a fund or portfolio at any given moment.

It was written around 1952, but its copyright notice was dated 1955. Brubeck's wife Iola, for whom the song was written, later wrote a lyric for the song, which led to singers such as Carmen McRae recording it. Although an earlier live recording is known, \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\" was first released on Brubeck's 1956 studio album Brubeck Plays Brubeck.  Composition  \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\" is written in the key of B flat major, and is a jazz ballad in thirty-two-bar form with an eight-bar interlude typically played between each chorus. Author of the 1996 biography It's About Time: The Dave Brubeck Story, Fred Hall, said that this jazz standard, like other standards, such as \\"Take Five,\\" has been performed by \\"various Brubeck combinations\\" and many other artists. All Music Guide to Jazz notes the \\"contrasting lines\\" of the piece, In the liner notes to Time Signatures Brubeck wrote, \\"For the first few years the quartet played almost all standards, until one day Paul Desmond said to me, 'We've got to hire somebody to write some material for us.' I said, 'Paul, are you kidding? I'll write two tunes in half an hour!' I wrote 'In Your Own Sweet Way' and 'The Waltz' that night. From then on we started doing my material a lot more.\\"  Release  Although at least one earlier concert recording is known, the song's first release, with three improvised choruses, was on Brubeck's 1956 solo album Brubeck Plays Brubeck. The first quartet version appeared on the 1956 album Dave Brubeck and Jay & Kai at Newport, issued on the Columbia label. An orchestral arrangement of the piece by Howard Brubeck appeared on the quartets live 1963 album Brandenburg Gate: Revisited.  Legacy and renditions  Many jazz artists have covered \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\". Miles Davis recorded it twice with his quintet in 1956‚Äîonce in March with Sonny Rollins as the quintet's saxophonist, and in May with John Coltrane in the band. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia, \\"Davis probably deserves as much credit as Brubeck for establishing 'In Your Own Sweet Way' as a jazz standard\\", partly because Davis closed \\"the A theme with an E natural, instead of the F that Brubeck intended. The prevalence of this Davis 'flat five'‚Äîwhich imparts a wry off- centeredness to the proceedings‚Äîin later performances is one measure of the trumpeter's influence in the dissemination of this song.\\" In 1960, jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery covered the standard on his fourth album The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery. Composer and arranger Clare Fischer recorded a solo piano version in 1963, which was featured on his album Easy Livin' three years later. The Keith Jarrett Trio played it live on several occasions collected on Keith Jarrett at the Blue Note and the Tokyo 1993 gig found on the Live in Japan 93/96 DVD. Jazz fusion guitarist John Etheridge recorded a well-received version for his 1994 album Ash. Art Farmer and Lee Konitz covered it in 1994 with the Joe Carter Quartet and Trio, as did pianist Robert Glasper in 2006. Jacky Terrasson and St√©phane Belmondo included the song in their 2016 album Mother. The song title gave its name to the 2010 documentary film about Brubeck, produced by Clint Eastwood, Dave Brubeck: In His Own Sweet Way. In 2013, keyboardist Bob James was inspired by \\"In Your Own Sweet Way\\" to compose his song \\"You Better Not Go to College\\" in homage to Brubeck.

Created by head writer Ron Carlivati, and introduced under executive producer Frank Valentini, Sabrina is introduced as a nerdy, pushover student nurse at General Hospital who has a crush on the widowed former playboy Dr. Patrick Drake. Patrick's other love interest, Dr. Britt Westbourne, takes pleasure in torturing Sabrina about the fact that Patrick will never notice her. Sabrina is very close with Patrick's daughter Emma, who also clashes with Britt. Sabrina is also known for her friendship with Felix DuBois. The character serves as a catalyst to re- introduce the annual tradition of the Nurses' Ball in honor of Patrick's late wife, Robin Scorpio. Patrick and Sabrina's romance is plagued by interference from Britt, who tries to pass her unborn child off as his. Later, the series introduces Sabrina's ex-boyfriend, Carlos Rivera, who battles Patrick for her affections. Patrick eventually proposes to Sabrina, while many including Carlos warn both of them that Robin is alive. With no proof, the couple goes through with the wedding only for Robin to appear as they are pronounced husband and wife. Sabrina was murdered in September 2016 by Paul Hornsby, who is acting as the hospital's mass-killer.  Creation   Background  Sabrina Maria Dominica Santiago was born to Gabriella Santiago and her husband in Puerto Rico around 1986. Sabrina is the adoptive cousin of former character Juan Santiago (Michael Saucedo). Juan suggests that Sabrina go to General Hospital to finish her nursing degree. Sabrina's adoptive mother was also a nurse and according to Sabrina was pretty good at her job. However, Sabrina's adoptive mother died when she was very young. Sabrina grows up idolizes her adoptive mother. After her adoptive mother's death, Sabrina's adoptive father sends her to live with her adoptive cousins in Puerto Rico as he is unable to raise her on his own. Sabrina carries her adoptive mother's stethoscope. In high school Sabrina dates Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Vincent Parise) and she loses her virginity to him. Immediately after college, Carlos wants to marry and start a family, while Sabrina wants to focus on her career. Right around the same time, Juan suggests Sabrina finish her nursing degree in Port Charles. As of June 2013, Sabrina was 27 years old.  Casting and characterization  Castillo originally auditioned for the role of Delores Padilla when GH's casting director, Mark Teschner noticed her on Franklin & Bash. She actually did a chemistry test with her current co-star, Jason Thompson, who portrayed Patrick. However, the series decided to stick with Rebecca Montoya as Delores. In the spring of 2012, she was contacted again by the series and she auditioned for the role of \\"Maya.\\" Castillo admitted that she didn't think they even came up with her character's real name until the day before she was to start taping her first scenes. She once again tested with Thompson. Castillo was chosen out of hundreds of other actresses for the role of Sabrina. After several weeks of waiting, she was contacted by the show again and read for executive producer, Frank Valentini. She went back for another chemistry test in late August. Castillo began filming her scenes on August 31, 2012. During the audition, the actresses started out getting \\"pretty\\" to do a fantasy scene in which the character admits her love for Patrick, and then transforming into a nerdy girl with glasses for the rest of the scene. To make sure she stood out from the 9 other actresses that the producers had called back, Castillo admitted that she \\"decided to have fun.\\" Several days later, Castillo learned from her manager that she had booked the role. The character first appeared on September 19, despite some sources stating the first air date to be September 14. The date may have been confused with Emily Wilson's first appearance as Ellie Trout, who did appear on the 14th. Castillo originated the role on a contractual basis. Though the character does not have a lisp, or the uni-brow, the huge glasses and the not so neat hair remain. Sabrina comes off very afraid at times, and usually cannot be honest about how she feels. Apart from her feelings for Patrick, Sabrina's whole life is defined by following in her mother's footsteps and becoming a nurse. Like her mother, \\"[Sabrina] wants to make a difference in the world. She truly cares about people.\\" Castillo described the character as \\"considering, kind and loving.\\" She has a mind of her own. In September 2016, it was revealed that Castillo would be departing the soap. Castillo last appeared on September 16, 2016.  Development   Introduction and triangle  When Kimberly McCullough, who played Robin departed from the series in February 2012 and the character was presumed dead, the producers were faced with the difficult task of having Patrick (Jason Thompson) move forward without the love of his life. Despite prior reports that Sabrina would not be involved with Patrick, it was confirmed that she would be introduced as a student nurse with Patrick as her crush. According to Castillo, the writers were very \\"merciful\\" in the introduction her character, instead of having Sabrina throw herself at Patrick very strongly, which would most likely lead to a lot fan backlash because of Thompson's popular pairing with McCullough's Robin, Sabrina is terrified at the sight of Patrick. In addition to her crush on Patrick, Sabrina helps revive the once annual series tradition of the Nurses' Ball, a benefit for AIDS research; Robin is HIV-positive. Early on, the triangle focuses on Patrick's romance with Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud) as Sabrina pines for his affections.  Transformation  Head writer Ron Carlivati said that Sabrina's confession, regardless of Patrick's reaction, in addition to Sabrina graduating from nursing school is an effort to show the character's growth. According to Castillo, Sabrina constantly avoids Patrick's attempts to confess by changing the subject. On the day of the ball, Sabrina lets Felix give her a makeover as a way of showing Patrick what he is missing out on. Castillo said Sabrina's makeover for the annual Nurse's Ball was interesting because in Sabrina's eyes, the glasses and not so tidy hair stood between her and Patrick. Even some of her own cast mates don't recognize her. With Sabrina's makeover, comes a new sense of self-confidence. Though the character's physical transformation played a huge part, it is more Sabrina's internal transformation that forces Patrick to reconsider his feelings for her. Carlivati said Sabrina \\"ultimately emerged as the swan at the Nurses Ball.\\"  Relationship with Patrick  Of the pairing, Carlivati said he wanted the love story to unfold slowly, starting with Sabrina being the best for Emma, while having Patrick overlook the fact that he has found the perfect woman to make a new life with. According to Castillo, though Sabrina's affections started out as a crush, they developed a friendship, and she gained a lot of respect for Patrick as she got to know him. For Sabrina, it grew into a \\"very deep love.\\" Like many other characters in soap history, Sabrina was faced with the situation of having her happiness ruined by her lover's presumed-dead spouse. Soap Opera Digest characterized the conflict between Robin and Sabrina as a \\"Cold War!\\" According to McCullough, Robin is aware of how Patrick and Sabrina love each other, and Castillo explained that it is extremely difficult because Sabrina has always had good intentions; she has never put her needs before the happiness of Patrick and Emma. If Sabrina needs to be the martyr, then she will take on that role. However, her relationships with both Patrick and Emma especially are very strong. McCullough said what makes the situation even more interesting is that everyone, from Robin to Patrick to Sabrina, is trying to be \\"noble.\\" Robin and Sabrina avoid any underhanded tactics or manipulations, which makes both women look extremely good. Of the dynamic between Sabrina and Robin, Castillo said \\"They have a lot in common,\\" and if the situation was different, they could actually be friends. Carlivati felt that having Patrick just ditch Sabrina and act like his feelings for her were instantly gone would have been extremely unrealistic. According to Carlivati, Felix is not the kind of person who will let Sabrina wallow in her potential defeat; he always encourages and supports her. Castillo told Soap Opera Digest that Sabrina saw it coming. \\"She knew at the wedding,\\" Castillo insisted. Sabrina immediately knew that Patrick belongs with Robin, and was, according to the actress, actually shocked that he is torn about the decision. However, there is a brief moment when Patrick comes to Sabrina that she thinks he may choose her. For Sabrina, Patrick's choice is \\"the end of it.\\" Sabrina has to find a way to move on with her life.  Carlos and pregnancy  However, by the time Patrick makes his decision and chooses Robin, Felix is not around to support her, but Carlos is. Both Carlos and Sabrina are in turmoil when he shows up on her doorstep with a gunshot wound. The last person Sabrina wants comfort from is Carlos, she wants Felix and is extremely relieved when he comes home. However, they have the issue of Carlos to deal with. In a way, Carlos fills a specific void in Sabrina's life, because he always takes care of her. In the past, \\"Carlos was there to offer her love, guidance and protection,\\" and he does so again after Sabrina is left to deal with Patrick's choice. Carlos loved Sabrina long before the makeover, and appreciated her \\"demure\\" personality believing she would make the perfect wife and mother. Castillo hints at the possibility of Sabrina reverting to her former self after being hurt, but said Sabrina has changed a lot while Carlos is still very much the same kind of man. He has a set image in his mind for what a wife and mother should be, and Sabrina's desire for something different is what led to their initial split. Castillo said, Carlos and Sabrina also shared a very deep love, so he would always have a spot in her heart. However, Castillo maintained that \\"it's not enough for her to go back to him.\\" However, Sabrina faces much bigger issue when she gets sick, and Felix suggest that she could be pregnant. Castillo revealed that pregnancy is the last thing on Sabrina's mind, she can't ignore it once a pregnancy test confirms it. Sabrina's on- screen pregnancy coincided with the real-life pregnancy of Teresa Castillo, which the actress confirms to Soaps In Depth. Sabrina refuses to use her pregnancy to fight for Patrick, because of Emma. And once Patrick makes his choice, Sabrina doesn't see him as an option.  Storylines  Sabrina immediately develops a crush on Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson), who has recently started dating Britt Westbourne (Kelly Thiebaud). Sabrina often babysits Patrick's daughter, Emma (Brooklyn Rae Silzer), during their dates and the two develop a friendship. When Emma tells her about the ball, Sabrina decides to revive the ball in honor of Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough), Patrick's late wife and Emma's mother. Sabrina, along with Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) and best friend, Felix DuBois (Marc Anthony Samuel) lead the committee to help relaunch the ball. Sabrina and Felix track down Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) to resume her usual job of running the ball. In the meantime, Patrick and Sabrina become very close friends, while Emma develops a disdain for Britt. Meanwhile, Patrick and Sabrina continue to bond, and nearly share a kiss on New Year's Eve. Britt manipulates the situation and lies to Sabrina about how uncomfortable Patrick is around her which leads to Sabrina quitting as Emma's babysitter. Things come to a head when a confrontation between Emma and Britt leads to Emma running away and Sabrina finds her. After Patrick dumps her, Britt seeks revenge on Sabrina and leads her to believe she accidentally killed a patient by administering the wrong medication, and Sabrina nearly gets kicked out of the nursing program. Later, Sabrina is accused of cheating on her nursing exam when a copy of the exam is found in her locker. Fortunately, Sabrina convinces head nurse Epiphany Johnson (Sonya Eddy) to let her take the test again, and she passes. Sabrina then admits her feelings for Patrick, not knowing if he will reciprocate, though she doesn't think it is possible. However, when it is revealed that Patrick paid for the investigation into the alleged cheating scandal that nearly cost her a spot in the nursing program, Felix insists that Patrick cares for her. Sabrina is no longer willing to wait around for Patrick. She instead accepts a date with Milo Giambetti (Drew Cheetwood). Sabrina initially hesitates, knowing Felix has a crush on Milo. However, she realizes that she needs to start looking elsewhere, and unlike Patrick, Milo shows an immediate interest in her. At the same time, Patrick is trying to find the appropriate time to tell Sabrina he has feelings for her. Patrick and Sabrina finally admit their feelings for one another. The relationship is immediately tested when Britt announces she is pregnant. After the ball, Sabrina and Felix team up to disprove the paternity of Britt's baby. Felix and Sabrina manage to get a DNA test, only for Britt to tamper with the results to make sure the child is proven to be Patrick's. However, Britt admits that Patrick isn't her baby's father, and Sabrina and Patrick try to work on their relationship. Sabrina is shocked when her ex- boyfriend, Carlos Rivera (Jeffrey Parise), comes to Port Charles to win her back. She tells Patrick, who is slightly jealous of Carlos' declaration. Though she assures him Carlos is not a threat, Patrick believes differently when he witnesses an intimate moment between Sabrina and a shirtless Carlos. Though Carlos says all the right words to Sabrina, she is in love with Patrick. Eventually, Patrick proposes to Sabrina, and she accepts. But on their wedding day, Robin shows up alive, and reunites with her husband and daughter. Sabrina is heartbroken, though Patrick is torn on what to do. Sabrina, though, tells him he has to make a decision. Robin tries to get Sabrina to break up with Patrick to make his choice easier, but Sabrina chooses not to, saying Patrick should make the decision. Eventually, Patrick tells Sabrina he's going back to his wife. Though Sabrina is devastated, she accepts his decision. However, soon after, Sabrina finds out she's pregnant with Patrick's child. She doesn't want to tell Patrick for fear of looking like Britt, but Felix blurts it out to Patrick. Carlos finds out and offers to raise the baby with Sabrina. When Patrick shows up to ask Sabrina if she's pregnant, Carlos claims that Sabrina is carrying his child, not Patrick's. Sabrina goes along with this and lies so Patrick will go back to Robin. However, when Sabrina misleads Emma with her baby's paternity, she feels guilty and admits to Patrick that she lied and he is the father of her baby. Robin leaves town soon after, and Sabrina is there for Emma when she needs a mother figure. In April 2014, Sabrina, Patrick, and Emma get into a hit-and- run car accident sending Sabrina into premature labor. She gives birth on the side of the road with Britt's help, and her son spends several weeks in the hospital fighting to survive. Patrick and Sabrina name him Gabriel after her mother and have him baptized before he passes away due to an underdeveloped respiratory system. Sabrina suffers a breakdown, and Patrick is forced to remind her that their son is dead. Sabrina leaves town with Juan shortly after the funeral. Sabrina returns to Port Charles in August 2014 and learns that Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) is responsible for her accident. Sabrina is led to believe that Ava Jerome (Maura West) put Rafe up to running her off the road to keep Carlos under her thumb, and she vows revenge. Sabrina intentionally prescribes Ava medication to induce labor. However, feeling guilty and questioning her decision, she confesses her schemes and loses her job at the hospital. In January 2015, Sabrina takes a job working for Michael Quartermaine (Chad Duell) at his new clinic. But when the clinic plans are put on hold, Michael offers to hire Sabrina as the nanny for his little sister, Avery. In the summer of 2015, Sabrina and Michael begin a romantic relationship and in September 2015, Sabrina learns she is pregnant with Michael's child. Their relationship ended when Michael learned that Carlos was the baby's father. In September 2016, Sabrina was killed by Paul Hornsby when she figured out he was the Hospital Killer after he attacked Monica.  Reception  Backlash to the character's introduction was very evident on social media with fans attacking Castillo personally. Sara Bibel and Luke Kerr described the character as \\"saccharin.\\" Michael Logan of TV Guide described Sabrina as \\"Ugly Betty‚Äîesque.\\" According to Michael Fairman, Sabrina, immediately draws comparisons to the character for her appearance and her \\"heart of gold.\\" Bibel admitted that she would never like a \\"do-gooder\\" like Sabrina and compared the character to Mary Sue. Bibel also said the character's dialogue was extremely similar to that of the teenaged Molly Lansing (Haley Pullos) which made her look too immature for Patrick. Bibel also described the character as \\"insipid.\\" Castillo told Soap Opera Digest that early on, she experienced a lot of \\"straight-up hate,\\" but was relieved that more fans gradually grew to like Sabrina. Castillo cited the Nurses' Ball episodes as the reason for fans changing their opinions. Maria Ciaccia described the character upon her introduction as \\"plain-looking.\\" Marlena De Lacroix aka Connie Passalacqua [Hayman] immediately loved the character of Sabrina. According to Passalacqua, Sabrina has an \\"instant charm.\\" Passalacqua described the character as \\"smart independent and not in the least easily destructible like so many young heroines Bob Guza used to write.\\" Passalacqua praised the writers for finally allowing Sabrina to stand on her own when she stood up to Epiphany about the cheating accusations. The character was listed on Latina magazine's website as one of the favorite Latinos on the series. Some fans thought Sabrina's story and the relationship with Patrick should have been reserved for Elizabeth Webber, Robin and Patrick's close friend. Sara Bibel was against the pairing and recommended the spunky Ellie Trout (Emily Wilson) would be a better love interest for Patrick, the brain surgeon. Michael Fairman said it was intriguing \\"how [Sabrina] was carefully placed into the Drake family's sphere.\\" Hayman also praised the romantic triangle and described Sabrina's relationship with Emma as \\"heart-tugging.\\" Despite the character's very soft exterior, fans did not take kindly to Sabrina as Patrick's potential love interest. Castillo admitted that she was not prepared for the fans to be so vocal, but said that she respected their loyalty to Robin and Patrick. However McCullough took the time to encourage Castillo about her role and noted the character's growth since her introduction. Regan Cellura of Daytime Confidential praised the triangle between Sabrina, Patrick and Britt, and Sabrina's friendship with Felix and Elizabeth. Jamey Giddens said that he didn't see a point at the beginning of the triangle, but the story eventually hooked him. Of Castillo, Giddens said, \\"it's easy to root for her in this mini-telenovela-meets-rom-com arc on GH.\\" Despite the huge fan base for Patrick and Robin, Castillo and the pairing of Patrick and Sabrina garnered a fan following, with the pairing being listed consistently in the top ten pairings in ABC Soaps In Depth, and Castillo being listed as one of fan favorite actresses on the series. On a poll on Daytime Confidential asking fans if Sabrina should just walk away from Patrick when Robin returned, 82% (3065 votes) agreed she should walk away. Sports analyst, Stephen A. Smith even weighed in on Patrick's dilemma on The Arsenio Hall Show with Robin as the obvious choice, despite Sabrina's good qualities. Patrick and Sabrina's wedding gave the series its largest viewership and best ratings season in seven years with 3.3. million people tuning in for the nuptials, which were interrupted by Robin. The pairing ranked at #22 on We Love Soaps list of the \\"25 Most Popular Couples of the Year.\\" In response to character's makeover during the Nurses' Ball, Bibel said she could do without the \\"Pretty Pink Princess\\" routine. Writing her like a Disney princess made the character seem too immature, according to Bibel. Bibel's dislike for Sabrina also made her root for Britt, during the pregnancy reveal. Ciaccia believed the character was an homage to Audrey Hepburn's Sabrina [Fairchild]. Ciaccia also noted the character's similarities to Lynn Herring's early portrayal of Lucy Coe as a \\"plain Jane librarian,\\" who also gets a makeover. Castillo on the other hand was more excited about fans coming to accept Sabrina as a part of Patrick's life, then she was about the makeover. Ron Carlivati praised Castillo for taking the risk by accepting the role as the \\"other woman\\" in Patrick's life and said she handled the task with \\"dignity and class.\\" Passalacqua applauded casting director Mark Teschner for finding Castillo, and the writers for coming up with the \\"refreshing new character.\\" Connie Passalacqua said Castillo brought an \\"innocence and youthful idealism\\" to the character making her a \\"breath of fresh air.\\" Passalacqua's husband, Edward Hayman also praised Castillo for her \\"sweet\\" yet vulnerable portrayal of the character. Michael Fairman said Castillo gave a \\"solid\\" performance in her portrayal of a devastated bride. Fairman also praised Castillo for her performance in the episode in which Patrick breaks things off with Sabrina to return to Robin. Marlena De Lacroix also praised Castillo for her portrayal of Sabrina and described her performance as \\"masterful\\" in showing Sabrina \\"great pain at seeing all her dreams come unraveled.\\"  References   External links  * * Santiago, Sabrina Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional Hispanic and Latino American people Category:Fictional nurses Category:Fictional nannies ","title":"Sabrina Santiago"},{"id":"37959175","text":"T…ôrlan may refer to: *Tarlan Ahmadov (b. 1971), Azerbaijani footballer *Tarlan Karimov (b. 1986), Azerbaijani judoka ","title":"T…ôrlan"},{"id":"37959176","text":"Nb.BbvCI is a nicking endonuclease used to cut one strand of double-stranded DNA.

The song, dedicated to the 19th-century mystic Ramakrishna, was composed in 1898. It is a prayer song, based on Raga Mishra Kalyana, Tala Ferta (Choutal, Tintal, Ektal) used in Indian classical music. Vivekananda's message through the poem was to free one self from the bondages of the world, and to make those who have freed themselves spread their knowledge of freedom widely until the whole humanity is filled with tremendous passion for freedom (from bondage and suffering).  History  Vivekananda,who died in 1902, was the star disciple of the holy saint Sri Ramakrishna. To follow Sri Ramakrishna's teachings, Vivekananda established Ramakrishna Math monastic order, which became part of the Hindu reform movements for regeneration to Hinduism. He became a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the western world. He toured the United States and Europe. In 1898, he was in Calcutta, India, taking part in the consecration of Ramakrishana Math monastery set up in the house of Nilambar Babu, a disciple of Ramakrishna. Vivekananda wrote the poem during his stay there. This arati is sung in all Ramakrishna maths and Ramakrishna missions in their daily prayers.  Theme  Vivekananda's deliberate attempt was to free individuals and relieve them from sufferings and bondage. He dedicated his life to this work. The same passion can be found in this prayer song. In this hymn Vivekananda addresses Ramakrishna, his master and praises him. He says his master is the breaker of the world's chain who is spotless who came to this world taking human form, he is embodiment of divine knowledge. He looks at the eyes of his master and finds they are bright with the wisdom of God and feels that can wake him from Maya. He again praises his master for his sacrifice as he thinks his master freely chose to take birth \\"in this prison\\" to unchain men from prison. Finally he requests his master's blessings and requests him to come to his heart's black cave and illuminate it, since his master, in his view is \\"light of the light\\".  Lyrics  The Khandana Bhava‚ÄìBandhana was written by Swami Vivekananda in Bengali as a hymn to his guru, Sri Ramakrishna. The English translation by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood is used by English speaking Vedanta Centers in the evening vesper worship services: Breaker of this world‚Äôs chain, We adore Thee, whom all men love. Spotless, taking man‚Äôs form, O Purifier, Thou art above the gunas three, Knowledge divine, not flesh; Thou whom the cosmos wears, A diamond at its heart. Let us look deep in Thine eyes; They are bright with the wisdom of God, That can wake us from Maya‚Äôs spell. Let us hold fast to Thy feet, Treading the waves of the world to safety. Oh, drunk with love, God-drunken Lover, In Thee all paths of all yogas meet. Lord of the worlds, Thou art ours, Who wert born a child of our time; Easy of access to us. O Merciful, if we take any hold Upon God in our prayer, It is by Thy grace alone, Since all Thine austerities Were practiced for our sake. How great was Thy sacrifice, Freely choosing Thy birth, In this prison, our Iron Age, To unchain us and set us free. Perfect, whom lust could not taint, Nor passion nor gold draw near, O Master of all who renounce, Fill our hearts full of love for Thee. Thou hast finished with fear and with doubt, Standing firm in the vision of God; Refuge to all who have cast Fame, fortune, and friends away. Without question Thou shelterest us, And the world‚Äôs great sea in its wrath Seems shrunk to the puddle That fills the hoofprint in the clay. Speech cannot hold Thee, nor mind, Yet without Thee we think not nor speak. Love, who art partial to none, We are equal before Thy sight. Taker-away of our pain, We salute Thee, though we are blind. Come to the heart‚Äôs black cave, and illumine, Thou light of the light.

It was founded October 1, 1898 by Mary Eleanor Brackenridge, Marin B. Fenwick and sixteen other individuals who had been inspired by the National Federation of Women's Clubs. Brackenridge served as the organization's first president. The sororal organization is the oldest civic organization in San Antonio. They partner with businesses, local government and other civic organizations to promote health, safety, welfare and education. One of its original goals was to bring the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution to fruition, and was the first Texas woman's club to promote the issue.A Guide to the Woman's Club of San Antonio Records, University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries (UTSA Libraries) Special Collections. In 1905, the club established the Isabella H. Brackenridge Scholarship for students at University of Texas Medical Branch. Since its inception, the club has been active in supporting education through scholarships and through political lobbying activities for educational reforms. They hold numerous fund raisers to promote San Antonio charities. The organization is active in community arts and cultural programs. They join other civic organizations to partner with the city in the annual Fiesta San Antonio. The organization is headquartered in the David J. and May Bock Woodward House at 1717 San Pedro Avenue, in the Alta Vista district of San Antonio. The furnished house was purchased in 1926 for $47,000. In keeping with the stipulations of the sale, the Woman's Club of San Antonio maintained a home-like setting and made changes only to accommodate areas for meetings and storage. The house was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1994. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Bexar County, Texas on February 16, 1996.

The species was described from Eocene to Oligocene aged fossils found in the United States of America. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Glabra. History and classification Acer ivanofense is represented by a group of fossil specimens recovered from late Eocene to early Oligocene outcrops of the lower Meshik Volcanics, formerly called the Meshik Formation, at US Geological Survey site 11418 on Road Island, Ivanof Bay on the Alaska Peninsula. The rocks were first named in 1929 by R.S. Knappen for material exposed along the Meshik River near Meshik Lake. In 1996 the sequence was reexamined and subsequently renamed the Meshick Volcanics by Robert L. Detterman and a group of researchers, to better reflect the lithology of the rocks. The age of the formation is considered to range from approximately to approximately . The species is known from the holotype specimen, USNM 396017a, and three other specimens, USNM 396017b, USNM 396017c, and USNM 396017d. All four specimens are preserved in the collections of the National Museum of Natural History. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. ivanofense in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name ivanofense is in recognition of the type location for the species in Ivanof Bay, Alaska. Description Leaves of A. ivanofense are simple in structure with a perfectly actinodromous vein structure in which the primary veins originate at the base of the lamina and run out towards the margin. The three-lobed leaves widely oval in shape with the lateral lobes being about one-half the width of the middle lobe. The leaves have three primary veins and an estimated size range of long by . Between four and seven secondary veins branch from the basal side of each lobal primary vein which then branch to form a bracing structure for the lobe. The leaves host compound teeth with each major tooth having two to three small teeth on the bottom edge and one tooth on the tip edge. The morphology of A. ivanofense suggests placement into the Acer section Glabra and the series Arguta. This is based on the overall vein structure in the lobes and the structuring of the veins forming the areolae.

Its territory is now part of the Moskovsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History Postcard of Vordere Vorstadt across from the Stock Exchange In 1329 the Teutonic Knights granted land on the southern shore of the Pregel River to the island town of Kneiphof primarily for constructing docks, but also for gardens, agriculture, and pastureland. The suburb which developed there, the Kneiph√∂fische Vorstadt, became a Freiheit district with special rights under the control of Kneiphof. Its Gerichtssiegel, or court seal, depicted a hand descending from clouds holding a weighing scale, flanked by the two hunting horns of Kneiphof.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 37 Much of K√∂nigsberg's Russian population was settled in Vorstadt.Armstedt, p. 247 By the Rath√§usliche Reglement of 13 June 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia merged Kneiphof and Vorstadt into the united city of K√∂nigsberg.Gause II, p. 65 Locations Vorstadt was divided into Vordere Vorstadt bordering the Pregel to the north and Hintere Vorstadt to the south bordering Haberberg. Vordere Vorstadt was originally documented as St. Antonsvorstadt, after St. Antonshospital, in 1376.Karl, p. 162 It was defended by a wall, palisades, and ditches in the year 1520 when it was threatened by Polish troops in the Horsemen's War.Armstedt, p. 50 In 1648 it was known as Innere Vorstadt and by 1677 as Vordere Vorstadt. It often suffered from fires; a conflagration in 1811 destroyed the house where Immanuel Kant was born. Hintere Vorstadt was developed after Vordere Vorstadt and was originally known as St. Georgsvorstadt, after St. Georgshospital. Hintere Vorstadt and St. Georgshospital were burnt during the Horsemen's War. The southern half was also known as √Ñussere Vorstadt. The common name of Hintere Vorstadt was documented in 1726.Karl, p. 64 The avenue Vorst√§dtische Langgasse ran from Haberberg Church north through Vorstadt before becoming the Kneiph√∂fische Langgasse in Kneiphof. It became one of K√∂nigsberg's busiest thoroughfares with the opening of the nearby Hauptbahnhof in 1929. The quarter also contained the Vorstadt Oberrealschule. In 1753 King Frederick II of Prussia allowed the city's Jews to build a Hasidic synagogue on Vordere Vorstadt's Schn√ºrlingsdamm, which was completed in 1756. Although the Alte Synagoge burned down in 1811, it was rebuilt on nearby Synagogenstra√üe and dedicated in 1815. In 1893 the Adass Jisroel, an Orthodox branch, opened their own synagoge on Synagogenstra√üe near the Alte Synagoge. The Liberal Neue Synagoge was opened in Lomse in the 1890s. K√∂nigsberg's synagogues were burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. K√∂nigsberg's stock exchange, the B√∂rse, was located by the Pregel between the bridges Gr√ºne Br√ºcke and K√∂ttelbr√ºcke. Fort Friedrichsburg existed just west of Vordere Vorstadt from 1657-1910.

The same day (November 9, 1917) Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko was placed in charge of the Petrograd Military District replacing at that post Mikhail Artemyevich Muravyov. Together with Muravyov, Antonov was placed in charge of an expeditionary force to the Southern Russia, while the acting Supreme Commander-in-Chief was General Nikolay Dukhonin.

After establishing a Soviet power in the capital of Russia the council continued to rely on decisions Petrograd VRK leadership and encouraged creation of new military revolutionary committees throughout the former Russian Empire that played a key role in solidifying of the Soviet power. By the beginning of 1918 the number of military revolutionary committees jumped to 220. In the Soviet historiography the role of Petrograd VRK was depicted as a preventative against the counter-revolution (such as the Kerensky‚ÄìKrasnov uprising) rather than an instigator of revolution.

Design and development Fiat's interest in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. The AN.1 was their first foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and to concentrate on the higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water- cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140 mm (5.51 in), compared with the A.12's 160 mm (6.30 in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom. The advantages of the Diesel engine were seen as: *higher fuel efficiency; *mechanical and electrical simplicity; *non-flammable fuel; *cheaper fuel, at the time only 20% the price of petrol. In 1931 Diesel engines were seen as the future motors of long range commercial aircraft. The AN.1 was test flown in at least two aircraft, easily replacing the standard Fiat A.12bis in an Ansaldo A.300/4 reconnaissance and attack aircraft and also mounted in a specially designed biplane, the Fiat AN.1. Operational history The first public performance of the AN.1 engine was at the Aerial Pageant held at Rome in June 1930 in the AN.1 biplane. This was flown by Renato Donati from the Fiat works at Turin to Rome, a distance of about 510 km (315 mi), on the first morning of the Pageant then displayed over Littorio Airport.

It was established by the U.S. government in order to rid leprosy from the Philippine Islands through the only method known at the time: isolating all existing cases and gradually phasing out the disease from the population.Annual report of the Philippine Commission, 1907, pt. 2 In addition to segregating the disease from the rest of the population, the island was later established in order to offer a better opportunity for people afflicted with leprosy to receive adequate care and modern treatments.Forbes, William Cameron. The Philippine Islands. 12. Kraus Reprint Co., 1976. 341‚Äì342. Print. Historical background Origin of leprosy in the Philippines The first known origin of leprosy in the Philippines dates back to time of the first Spanish Exploration of the Philippines. In the sixteenth century, Franciscan Friars established a shelter for the care of those afflicted with leprosy close to their monastery in Manila, where the hospital San Juan de Dios is located.Dr. Heiser, V., An American Doctor's Odyssey. W. W. Norton & Company, 1936 In 1632 the Emperor of Japan, knowing that the Spanish Catholic Church had an interest in caring for those afflicted with disease, sent one hundred and thirty four Japanese known sufferers of leprosy by ship to Manila. The Spanish Franciscans, initially reluctant to accept the shipment from the emperor, eventually took in the Japanese patients and housed them in the Hospital of San Lazaro in Manila.Foreman, John. The Philippine Islands. 3rd ed. London: T. Fisher Unwin, 2007. 341‚Äì342. eBook. However, the emperor's shipment of Japanese citizens infected with leprosy is not attributed as the main source of Leprosy in the colonies, as the Philippines is known to have had commerce with other Asian countries known to have been afflicted with the leprosy.H.W Wade and J. A Basa, \\"Culion Leper Colony,\\" American Journal of Tropical Medicine, 3 (Sep. 1923) By 1830, approximately four hundred lepers were patients in Leper Colonies established by Catholic priests at Manila, Cebu and Nueva Caceres. Those afflicted with leprosy were segregated from the rest of the population but still allowed to have contact with family, inhabitants and other members of the island.Victor G. Heiser, \\"Leprosy in the Philippine Islands,\\" Public Health Report, 24 (Aug. 13, 1909) The purpose of the hospitals and leprosy establishments on the islands at that time wasn't to eradicate the disease or segregate it from the rest of the population but instead to provide humanitarian aid. The Hospital of San Lazaro in Manila was run by Franciscan Friars until September 1898, when it was turned over to the American authorities.Burkholder, S., & Hart, I. (2008, November 21). History of the San Lazaro Hospital. Retrieved from http://slh.doh.gov.ph The other Islands, Cebu, Palestina, and Nueva C√°ceres were ordered abandoned by General Leonard Wood. Move from the islands to Culion and transfer to American power By the time American forces landed in the Philippines at the beginning of the twentieth century, surveys estimated that approximately 3,500 to 4,000 people with leprosy were living on the islands and some 1,200 new cases were developing each year. With this burgeoning patient population throughout the colony, American Forces shifted the colony's purpose from giving humanitarian aid to seeking to establish a formal, segregated island to control the spread of the diseases and ultimately exterminate it. Military authorities surveyed two locations, one at Culion and one at Cagayan de Jolo and found Culion to be the most desirable location. $50,000 was given to the colony by the Second Philippine Commission on October 27, 1902 for the creation of the Culion Leper Colony under the Director of Health Victor Heiser. However, construction did not begin until 1905 due to issues financing the project and conflicting opinions amongst medical professionals arguing whether segregation was an appropriate method of controlling and eradicating the disease. Not until May 27, 1906, did the first 370 patients from Cebu land on Culion carried by two Coast Guard cutters.Wheeler, M. M. (1913). \\"The Culion leper colony.\\" The American Journal of Nursing. 13(9), 633‚Äì666. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3403941 These two ships made multiple trips to different parts of the Philippines and brought patients to Culion. Structure, function and government of Culion Segregation system By Act 1711 of the Philippine Commission, passed September 12, 1907, Victor G. Heiser was given full responsibility of the segregation program. Heiser was given the responsibility of locating, segregating, and moving any known person afflicted with Leprosy in the Philippines to Culion. His plan was to remove patients first from well isolated islands with few infected people so that the spread of the disease could be prevented where it was not firmly entrenched. The segregation system initially received resistance from Filipinos afflicted with leprosy. In an attempt to popularize the island so that patients went to Culion willingly, Heiser sent agents to Filipino towns to disseminate information about Culion's housing, the type of food the residents would eat, and the medical facilities available. Nevertheless, many of the islands' inhabitants made great effort to evade Heiser's segregation program. The public would also tip off the authorities about people who were possibly infected with leprosy. Many Filipinos, in acts of revenge, would anonymously notify authorities of a purported case of leprosy in hope of having them removed from the island. Even politicians, using leprosy's negative public image, would anonymously report their political foes' family members as carriers of leprosy for their own political gain. Staff The island was initially staffed by one physician, Dr. Charles F. de Mey, five French sisters of the (SPC) Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres, a Jesuit priest and several other employees. The staff eventually grew to include a Chief Physician, twelve clinical physicians, one dental surgeon, one pharmacist, twenty-one graduate nurses, thirteen sisters of the Sisters of Saint Paul of Chartres and 150 nursing aids.Thomas, Howard Elsworth. A Study of Leprosy Colony Policies. New York: American Mission to Lepers, 1947 Infrastructure Members of the Culion leper colony in an undated photograph. The women in the center appear to be playing the kulintang traditional instrument. As more resources became available, the colony began to put effort into expanding construction and building its own community. Over four-hundred houses, a theatre, a town hall, a school, a piped water supply with reservoirs and a sanitary sewer system were built for the colony's patients and staff. Since leprosy confined only patients in its most severe form to bed, patients were allowed to organize their own municipal government with its police force, civic courts and currency system isolated from the rest of the Philippine islands.Annual report of the Philippine Commission, 1906, pt. 2, p 17 Municipal government Under the direction of Heiser, the colony's municipal government was made up of a Chief Physician and representatives from each tribal group living on the island, composing of the Visayan, Tagalog, Ilocano, Bicolano, Ilongo, Moro, English and Americans. Each representative, by popular vote, was elected every two years by person of both sexes and of age between 18 and 60 years old. With this form of governance, the first instance of women suffrage was exhibited before anywhere on the Philippine Islands in 1908. Enforcing the laws set up by the Chief and representatives was a police force that regularly patrolled the outlying districts and maintained order inside the colony. The police force, made up of patients, also played a role in maintaining the island's cleanliness and sanitary conditions. In addition to a police force, a civil court system was established where petty cases were discussed. Marriage, family and its religious influence on the island Religious organizations on the island influenced the role of marriage, and consequently parenthood, in patients' lives. Before Filipino authorities established a ban on marriage in the colony, Christian groups on the island, along with authorities, took an active stand against the marriage between lepers, citing that \\"marital life is not conducive to their own well being ... they usher into the world healthy and innocent children who are born only to be separated from their parents and placed under the care of the Welfare Commissioner or of a relative, so that they may not suffer the fate of their progenitors.\\" Authorities were also opposed to marriage due to statistics at the time showing that if babies were not removed from their mothers before they were six months old, approximately half of them would become leprous. This led to a problem for Heiser in which, without the support of a law giving him authority to remove a child, he had to either somehow convince a leprous mother to turn over her child or, without the removal of the child, be forced to possibly allow the mother to expose leprosy to her child. Identification of leprosy, modes of treatment and native remedies at Culion The epidemiology of leprosy transmission was still hotly debated at the time of the leprosarium's existence. Hundreds of remedies had been tried but none yielded promising results all while patients alternately recovered and relapsed for reasons not understood. Natives used remedies ranging from hot baths to rubbing leaves on leprous lesions to spiritual charms. Heiser admitted that Western medicine often failed to identify those who were afflicted with leprosy. The use of Chaulmoogra oil, first demonstrated in a Louisiana leper Colony, became an effective way of treating the disease as a number of cases became negative after the first year. However, the treatment was very slow in improvement and recovery. The effectiveness of Chaulmoogra oil brought other problems as well. People treated with Chaulmoogra oil, although free of the disease, suffered great physical mutilations caused by leprous sores. With the negative stigma of leprosy and unsightly sores, normal reintegration back into society after successful treatment became an almost impossible task. Authorities segregated part of the island where leprosy-free but badly mutilated patients could earn a living. Health-education, as proposed by the World Health Organization, was aimed to control this stigmatization.WHO Expert committee on leprosy: Fourth report (WHO Technical Report Series, No. 459). Geneva: WHO; 1970 American presence in Culion Many American veterans fighting in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War ultimately contracted leprosy while serving overseas.Merlin L. Brubaker, Chapman H.

Wade and his associates published hundreds of papers on leprosy, including many in the International Journal of Leprosy, which the Leonard Wood Memorial supported and Wade edited. Decline Under the appointment-ship of Governor General Leonard Wood, Culion continued to expand its staff and facilities and continued using Chaulmoogra Oil for treatment into the 1920s and 1930s.Chapman, Ronald Fettes. Leonard Wood and Leprosy in the Philippines. Washington, D.C: University Press of America, 1982. pg 83 However, it was later shown that 46.4% of the patients discharged as negative subsequently relapsed. Therefore, sentiment began to grow in favor of decreasing the importance of Culion and in favor of modifications of the method of segregation in the islands. Culion's decline began with staff layoffs during the financial crisis of 1933. After 1935, only leprosy patients who preferred life at Culion as opposed to life at a leprosarium closer to their region were shipped to Culion. Due to advanced treatment methods and the influence of regional clinics, Culion lost its eminence as a model leprosarium and had its population reduced to 739 in 1978.

He was at various times Secretary General of the VdgB (the Peasants Mutual Aid Association), deputy in the parliament (the Volkskammer) and a member of the Central Committee of the SED. Early days and emigration Kurt Vieweg was born in G√∂ttingen, the son of a bank employee . After attending high school, in 1930-1931 he completed an apprenticeship as an agricultural agent in Eisleben. In his youth he was a member of the Wandervogel movement (similar to the Boy Scouts). In 1930 he joined the Hitler Youth, in which he remained until 1932, and was promoted there to the level of deputy \\"Jungbannf√ºhrer\\" (Junior colonel). In parallel, from 1931 he was working for the KJVD, the Young Communist League of Germany. By 1932 Vieweg was a member of the KJVD in Weissenfels and member of the Commiunist Party, the KPD. His final Communist activities in Germany were as an employee of the KJVD for Saxony-Anhalt. In autumn 1933 Vieweg emigrated to Denmark. He was initially in Lyngby and Gentofte working for International Red Aid. From 1935 until the occupation of the country in 1940 Vieweg was a visiting student at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen. In parallel, from 1936 he was an employee of the illegal KPD leadership for the Northern sector. Vieweg was member of a group led by Walter Weidauer which was called the \\"Peasant Commission\\", which aimed to make contact with farmer groups in Germany. This group published the magazine \\"Bauernbriefe\\" (Farmers' Letters), for which Vieweg wrote articles under the pseudonym \\"Oswald\\". Since in the public image he was not necessarily seen as a communist, from the beginning of 1940 he could officially study agriculture. By the German occupation in April 1940 Vieweg was however again forced into illegality. The next few years were spent largely with little political action. He dealt mainly with collection of information on Scandinavian agriculture for the Moscow Communist Party headquarters. In 1943 the KPD sent most of its members in Denmark to Sweden, including Vieweg. There he was interned briefly in a camp near Tyllesand. He then worked as a forester and as a factory worker. As leader of the Communist Party group in Gothenburg-Bor√•s he here came, probably for the first time, into contact with Herbert Wehner. Since Vieweg could prove his guest studentship in Copenhagen to have been successful, from 1944 he was able to resume his studies at the Ultuna Agricultural University in Uppsala as part of a Swedish aid program for Scandinavian Hitler refugees. During his stay in Sweden, he was greatly influenced by the agricultural policies of the Swedish Social Democratic Party program. This influence was shown in his policy statement, published in 1944, \\"The farmers and the upcoming democratic republic\\" in which he called for the creation of cooperatives, but also spoke out in favour of maintaining the capitalist mode of production. This programme and his course of study were the basis for Vieweg's status as the agricultural expert of the exiled KPD. In the spring of 1945, Vieweg returned to Denmark. He was initially secretary of the Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee in Copenhagen and was later taken on as an employee at the Danish Ministry of Social Affairs. Before his return to Germany Vieweg was also the political head of the Copenhagen KPD group. Return to Germany In summer 1946 Vieweg and his wife Gertrud returned via Poland to Halle in the Soviet occupation zone. As a former Communist Party member, he now became a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED). He was assigned to the VdgB and became its deputy secretary for Saxony-Anhalt. Soon, however, he rose to the position of National Secretary. In mid-August 1947, not least because of his professional qualifications, Vieweg was entrusted by party decision with the post of Secretary General of the VdgB, succeeding Anton Jadasch. The first German peasant congress, at which the regional associations were dissolved and the central Association was founded, legitimized this decision with an official election. Vieweg now became very active and lectured at various universities about his agricultural policy ideas in which, among other things, he repeatedly defended the family farm. He argued consistently for the retention of the former agricultural structures and for the \\"full development of the private initiative of farms\\". This scientific activity in 1951 led to his appointment as full member of the German Academy of Agricultural Sciences. In 1948 Vieweg was taken on as an employee of the Office of the German Economic Commission (DWK), the predecessor of the East German government. In January 1949, Kurt Vieweg was co-opted into the party leadership of the SED and at the third SED Party Congress, in 1950, elected onto the Central Committee of the SED, where he remained until 1954, and there acted as secretary for rural affairs. In this role, Vieweg designed, within the framework of the existing Soviet policy on Germany, several agricultural programmes, including some for the whole of Germany, influenced by German and Scandinavian social democratic programmes, but also using ideas from the Reichsn√§hrstand, the agricultural regulatory body from the Nazi period. In the elections for the Volkskammer (parliament) on 19 October 1950 he was chosen as a deputy for the SED, which he remained for the entire first term. On behalf of the Central Committee of the SED Vieweg set to work on the construction of illegal organisations, including the conspiratorial \\"All-German Working Group for Agriculture and Forestry\\" in West Germany, which he also led. Enemy of the Party In the spring of 1952, however, this illegal (from a GDR viewpoint) work of the VdgB in the West was revealed. This event together with an investigation in a party purge by the Central Party Control Commission of the SED of Vieweg's activity in his Scandinavian emigration brought him gradually into disrepute. As it was suspected that he might flee, he was kept under observation by the Ministry of State Security (the Stasi). In consequence of the investigation by the Central Party Control Commission, despite very conflicting accounts by witnesses of his activities in the Nordic countries Vieweg was accused of faking questionnaires, which made it necessary, in the Commission's view, for him at least to be removed from the Secretariat of the SED. Officially a resignation for health reasons was announced. He was also removed from his position as General Secretary of the VdgB. Vieweg was not dropped altogether, however, but tasked with setting up the Institute of Agricultural Economics at the German Academy of Agricultural Sciences. He was now in a position to begin an academic career. He received his doctorate in 1955 at the Humboldt University of Berlin and was appointed professor of the German Academy of Agricultural Sciences. As editor along with Otto Rosenkranz of the multi-volume reference work \\"Handbook for cooperative farmers\\" in the same year he received the National Prize of the GDR. Vieweg claimed a leading position for his institute in agro-economic research in the GDR. This claim, and the creation of internal party brochures that were strongly influenced by his study trip to Sweden and Denmark in November 1955 and were met with little enthusiasm by many high SED functionaries, did not work to his advantage. By-passing him and his institution, the SED created an agricultural commission to promote collectivization. Disillusioned by this policy and affected by the revelations of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the events of autumn 1956 in Hungary Vieweg criticized the existing agricultural policy of the SED. In November 1956, therefore, Vieweg proposed his own programme with the title \\"New agricultural programme for the development of agriculture in the building of socialism in the GDR\\". During the 30th Central Committee plenum on 30 January 1957 this programme was denounced by Walter Ulbricht as \\"restoration of capitalism in agriculture\\". They came down heavily on him. On 18 March 1957 the Central Party Control Commission of the SED decided on his expulsion from the party together with his forced resignation from all political office. Escape and imprisonment In this situation, Vieweg saw his only way out as flight to West Germany. On 27 March 1957 he set off for West Berlin. He initially found refuge as guest of Herbert Wehner. Then on 19 October he unexpectedly returned to the GDR. (It has been suggested that Vieweg returned having been given a guarantee of impunity by Markus Wolf, and at the urging of Herbert Wehner.) Probably in breach of promises given, he was immediately arrested, although the warrant was not issued until 27 March 1958. In October 1959, the Supreme Court of the GDR convicted Kurt Vieweg of \\"treason\\" and sentenced him to twelve years in prison, along with forfeiture of all titles and claims. In December 1964 he was released from prison in Bautzen by a pardon of the State Council. On 27 December 1990, the verdict was set aside by the district court in Berlin. As an academic in Greifswald In 1965 Vieweg was given a job in the Nordic Institute of the University of Greifswald. In 1969 he was research group leader and he took up teaching again. As well as his research Vieweg also worked for the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Stasi. From 1971 he was a full professor, until he retired in 1974. He continued to live in Greifswald, but died of cancer in a Berlin hospital on 2 December 1976. Sources * Wer war wer in der DDR? * Michael F. Scholz: Bauernopfer der deutschen Frage.

History When Beogradski Sportski Klub (BSK) was founded in 1911, the club which dominated the fields of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes developed a significant fan base. Throughout the several wars that took place since the founding of BSK, the club's turbulent history (which is corresponding with the volatile history of the Balkans overall) has produced adverse effects onto the average attendance of today's matches in which OFK Beograd plays. An organized group appeared for the first time in 1984 under the name of \\"Blue Thunders\\". The group lived under that name until 1990. When they were influenced by the rise of nationalism in Yugoslavia, they changed their name to \\"Sokolovi\\" (Falcons). The group officially collapsed in 1993 about a year after UN sanctions were put on Yugoslavia. The fans' love towards the club was certainly not forgotten and in 1994 a new group is founded ‚Äì Plava Unija Beograd. The name remains the title of OFK Beograd's main group of ultras. OFK Beograd's fans have been known to be resistant of past regimes. In the 1990s, Milicionar Belgrade, a pro-regime police-backed team, entered the first division. When OFK Beograd first played against them, the OFK fans reacted with creation of banner which bore the message ‚ÄúGoal Against the Regime‚Äù. Friendships Plava Unija fostered a friendship with Vo≈ædovac's fans, \\"Invalidi\\" while the club still played in Yugoslavia's second tier from 1996 to 1998. That friendship still remains to this day. OFK Beograd is also known to be supported by fans of Dynamo Moscow.Moscow fan club OFK Beograd official website Social activities They Plava Unija express their love for their city, club and country with many creative activities. In March 2011, the Plava Unija started a project called ‚Ä≥Plava unija za zeleni Beograd‚Ä≥ (Plava Unija for a green Belgrade), which is dedicated for the promotion of healthy living and ecology, as well as raising environmental awareness among all the people who watch games in stadiums.

He made his debut in 1990. Wildside has had successful stints in Reading based IWA Independent Wrestling Alliance from 1991 to 1994, The RCW ‚Äì Regional Championship Wrestling from 1995‚Äì1997, brief appearances in the York, Pennsylvania based: NCW as late as 1998, and the Reading-based WPW ‚Äì World Professional Wrestling from 1999 to 2002. Wildside is best known for his 3-year run from 1991‚Äì1993 with the IWCCW (International World Class Championship Wrestling) based out of Parsippany, NJ. There, whilst managed by Nurse Vanessa Feelgood he had great success and traveled with the promotion through the New England States. Wildside had an undefeated singles record up until his final IWCCW match where he was defeated by Tommy Dreamer after Nurse Feelgood hit the Doctor with his own bag. After leaving the IWCCW the Doctor and Nurse were reunited and continued to work together. Nurse Vanessa's popularity propelled them into every major wrestling magazine in 1992 and 1993. The Nurse was the only independent manager to be listed in the top 10 managers in every magazine almost always number 10, even appearing on the cover of Wrestling All Stars in August 1992. In addition to wrestling as a singles competitor, while in the IWCCW Wildside also formed several successful tag teams with partners such as Man Mountain Mike, The Metal Maniac and most notably with his mentor Jimmy Deo. As a tag partner he had memorable feuds with the Sioux War Party, and the tag team of Nikolia Volkoff and Cousin Luke. His best tag partner was Kid Extreme (Chio Frost) in the RCW where they were part of the Bodacious Alliance. Wildside was trained primarily by the Maniac Jimmy Deo and his cousin Jeff Grippley with follow up training by Bobby Bold Eagle at Gleason's arena in Brooklyn, NY, along with Ted Petty. Deo Grippley and Wildside would then form a training partnership and open \\"Deo's Dungeon\\" Pro-Wrestling TrainingCenter, 405 South 5th Street Reading PA in mid 1991.

Formulation  Korte's four laws were first proposed in 1915 by Adolf Korte. The third law, particularly, describes how the increase in distance between two stimuli narrows the range of interstimulus intervals (ISI), which produce the apparent motion. It holds that there is a requirement for the proportional decrease in the frequency in which two stimulators are activated in alternation with the increase in ISI to ensure the quality of apparent motion. One identified violation of the Korte's law occurs if the shortest path between seen arm positions is not possible anatomically. This was demonstrated by Maggie Shiffrar and Jennifer Freyd using a picture that showed a woman demonstrating two positions. This highlighted the problem in taking the shortest path to perform the alternating postures. The laws were composed of general statements (laws) describing beta movement in the sense of \\"optimal motion\\". These outlined several constraints for obtaining the percept of apparent motion between flashes: \\"(1) larger separations require higher intensities, (2) slower presentation rates require higher intensities, (3) larger separations require slower presentation rates, (4) longer flash durations require shorter intervals . A modern formulation of the law is that the greater the length of a path between two successively presented stimuli, the greater the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) must be for an observer to perceive the two stimuli as a single mobile object. Typically, the relationship between distance and minimal SOA is linear. Arguably, Korte's third law is counterintuitive. One might expect that successive stimuli are less likely to be perceived as a single object as both distance and interval increase, and therefore, a negative relationship should be observed instead. In fact, such a negative relationship can be observed as well as Korte's law. Which relationship holds depends on speed. Korte's law also involves a constancy of velocity through apparent motion and it is said that data do not support it.

These hills have similarities to other hills where Jain temples have been built in Bihar, Gwalior, Mount Abu and Girnar. The Jain's sacred hill of Shatrunjaya have 865 temples atop itself. The hills were sanctified when Rishabha, the first tirthankara of Jainism, gave his first sermon on the top of this hill . The ancient history of the hills is also traced to Pundarika Swami, a chief Ganadhara and grandson of Rishabha, who attained Nirvana/Moksha here. His shrine located opposite to the main Adinath temple, built by Son of Rishabha, Bharata. There are several alternate spellings, including ≈öatru√±jaya, Satrunjaya, Shetrunja, and Shetrunjo. Shatrunjaya was also known as Pundarikgiri as Pundarik was said to have attained nirvana on this mountain. Alternate names include Siddhakshetra or Siddhanchal as many thirtankaras have received enlightenment here. Etymology Jains refer to their temples as derasaras.

The topography is rugged while the landscape is drought-affected. Culture The hills are an ancient tirtha (religious pilgrimage site). The Palitana temples, a pilgrimage complex on both hills and their saddle, are reached by climbing approximately 3750 stone steps, which are carved into the mountain. The climb is from the base and takes approximately two hours. The hills are closed to pilgrims for four months during the monsoon season. The pilgrimage is known as \\"Shri Shantrunjay Teerth Yatra\\". It occurs from the Poornima day (Full Moon Day) of Kartik month according to the Jain calendar (October‚ÄìNovember as per the Gregorian calendar).

The landlords were predominantly higher caste individuals. When those from the lower castes borrowed money against their land and defaulted, they entered a life of debt bondage. The slaves formed 12.2% of the total population in 1930. The patterns of slavery and slave population varied between districts. Various laws were passed during 1811, 1812 and 1823 to restrict slavery and prevent child labour, though the slave trade was only ended with the Indian Slavery Act of 1843, and the sale of slaves became a criminal offence in 1862 under the new Indian Penal Code. Pattern The Mirasdars, or landlords, were usually from the higher castes. Lower caste individuals borrowed money against their holdings from the mirasdars for marriage expenses, housing, or farming costs. On defaulting, they would find themselves obliged to repay the debt through labour. Hereditary relationships continued between debtors and their masters, as generations found themselves in debt bondage, leading to slavery. The opinion is divided on whether Brahmins directly used slaves or employed hired labourers. A theory, emitting from the note of the collector of Trichonopoly in 1819, states that the Brahmins employed lower castes labourers and the non-Brahmin landlords used lower caste slaves. Slavery was observed in almost all castes, both Brahmin and non-Brahmin.British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society 1841, p. 5 The pattern of slavery varied between different districts of the presidency, as did the sale of workers with landKumar pp. 43‚Äì48 In South Arcot and Coimbatore, slaves could be sold to anyone. In Coimbatore, slavery during the early 19th century was predominantly debt based. Serfs were sold along with land in Trichonopoly. The collector of Tinnevelly reported in 1919 that there was no specific pattern for selling serfs with land or slaves alone. It was later observed that slaves were sold with land, a situation closer to what would be called serfdom. A similar pattern was observed in Tanjore, where the sale of slaves to other estates was rare. In Madurai, slavery was in gradual decline as early as 1819. Some slaves, after liberation joined the Presidency army as Sepoys. In the northern parts of the Presidency, like Masulipatnam and Ganjam, agrarian slavery was minimal. In the Telugu speaking districts, the slaves were of three kinds ‚Äì servants to zamindars, servants to Muslims, and labourers attached to land. Distribution The Law Commission report on slavery in 1841 contained the indicative figures on the number of slaves, based the numbers categorised as Pallars and Paraiyar.British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society 1841, p. 4 In South Arcot , the number of slaves was 17,000 in 1819, comprising less than 4% of the population. In Tanjore, the numbers were reported to be more numerous, while in Madurai it was less. The Tinnelvely collector reported 38% of the whole population as slaves. In Trichonopoly, the collector estimated 10,000 slaves in wet parts and 600 in dry parts of the district. In Nellore, the slave population was 14.6% of the total population in 1827 and 16% in 1930. Slaves formed 12.2% of the total population in 1930.Kumar pp. 52‚Äì53 Laws The Slave Trade Felony Act of 1811, created a criminal penalty for the importation of slaves into British Territory. There were proposed regulations in 1823 to prevent child labour.British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society 1841, p. 27 In 1833, the Slavery Abolition Act received Royal Assent, though the Act did not \\"extend to any of the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company, or to the Island of Ceylon, or to the Island of Saint Helena.\\" Act V of 1843 finally ended the slave trade in India, and this was incorporated in 1862 under the new Indian Penal Code.

After beginning her career in 1921 on tour in South Africa and Australasia with her mother's theatre company, she made her London debut in 1925, gaining wide notice by 1927.

Its territory is now part of the Moskovsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History The hill Haberberg located south of Hintere Vorstadt in Natangia was first documented in the charter of Kneiphof in 1327. It was one of the safest spots in the region when the Pregel River would flood. Gerke Hoppener, a lokator employed by the Teutonic Knights, founded the village of Haberberg with 19 morgen and Kulm law in 1378.Gause I, p. 55 Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach granted the village to the town of Kneiphof in 1522. Haberberg was divided into Unterhaberberg (Lower Haberberg) to the north and Oberhaberberg (Upper Haberberg) to the south. The village administered Alter Garten to its west, but Nasser Garten was a separate quarter; the two garden territories were divided by the Brandenburg Gate. The Viehmarkt in eastern Haberberg was a market for cattle and horses from Natangia, Bartia, and southern Lithuania. Just north of the Viehmarkt was the Hohe Br√ºcke, a bridge connecting to the island quarter of Lomse.

He is known to be the first appointed judge in California of Armenian descent.  Life  Ralph Moradian graduated Fresno High School. He attended Fresno Normal School (later Fresno State College) for two years-all the education his mother could afford even though he held a variety of jobs as a teenager. Moradian's parents were divorced in 1911, becoming, to Moradian's knowledge, the first American- Armenians in the Fresno area to be divorced. His father, Dr. John Moradian, practiced medicene in Fresno for several years until the divorce, after which he moved to Chicago. After leaving school Ralph Moradian worked as reporter for The Fresno Evening Herald, The Fresno Morning Republican, and The San Francisco Chronicle. In 1934, despite never attending law school, he passed the Bar and became a lawyer. He became a Deputy District Attorney, the first Armenian to serve in that position and probably the first Armenian to be appointed to a governmental position in the area. After several years he left the District Attorney's office and stayed in private practice until 1963. In October 1963, Governor Edmund G. Brown appointed Moradian to the Municipal Court, a position he held until December 1976 when he retired. He continued to serve the Family Court without pay from 1976 to 1991. After retiring the second time, he edited the Fresno County Bar Bulletin. He was the first Armenian judge to be appointed in the state of California. He died in 1997.

Etymology The original name Neue Sorge was derived from the Old Prussian zarge, meaning enclosed fields,M√ºhlpfordt, p. 79 or sarge, meaning sentinel or watchman.Karl, p. 86 In folk etymology, the German language name derived from the response of Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, 17th century governor of K√∂nigsberg, when asked what the developing district should be called: \\"Wieder eine neue Sorge!\\" (\\"Again a new worry!\\").Boetticher, p. 145 The later name K√∂nigstra√üe means \\"King Street\\" in German.

She wrote songs as well as compositions for violin, piano and solo songs. Her collected works consists of about 40 compositions. Ika Peyron was the foster child of the merchant Anton Asp, who wished for her to have a profession and gave her a god education. Asp wished for her to become a medical doctor, but she was early on focused on music. She was educated as a pianist in Stockholm and a student of Louise Engstr√∂m, Ivar Hallstr√∂m, Johan van Boom, Emil Sj√∂gren and Anton Andersen. She attempted to compose, but gave up because of the attitude toward female composers. In 1865 she married the merchant and politician Ludvig Peyron, and devoted the next decade to raising her sons. In the late 1870s, her sons were no longer small, and the attitude toward female composers had changed. Ika Peyron devoted herself completely to composition from the 1880s, when she tutored as well as directed and performed concerts at the chapels of the theatres and at the Ladies' Society Nya Idun.

Svir is a part of the Volga‚ÄìBaltic Waterway, connecting the basins of the Volga and the Neva Rivers, with heavy cargo and cruise traffic. To accommodate the waterway, a lock was built to bypass the dam of the power station. The construction started in 1927 and was coordinated by Genrikh Graftio, who had been responsible for the construction of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station. The construction was complicated by the fact that the ground in the area is soft, and the dam was built with certain angle to the riverbed, so that the water pressure pushed it to the ground. The construction was completed in 1933. During World War II, the Svir separated Soviet (south) and Finnish (north) troops, and the dam was destroyed. It was restored after the war. The name of the station was originally the Svir Hydroelectric Station. Since 1955, the Lower Svir Hydroelectric Station and the Upper Svir Hydroelectric Station, located in Podporozhye, perform coordination and, in particular, jointly regulate the water level in the Svir.

It re-examined the 1916 Battle of the Somme during the First World War. Production The film was made at Isleworth Studios using a docudrama format. It involved a number of the personnel who had previously worked on a successful series of documentary reconstructions of First World War battles by British Instructional Films released between 1921 and 1927. British Instructional Films had finished their series with The Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands, and Geoffrey Barkas moved to the newly established New Era films to carry on the cycle. When Barkas fell ill, Wetherell was brought in to take over the project. Although Wetherell received the directors credit, much of the film was made by Barkas and Boyd Cable.Low p.181 Toronto ads touted that the Imperial Army Museum provided the footage; its actual name is the Imperial War Museum.

Critical reception A \\"masterpiece of British pictures,\\" a \\"press agent\\" for the film told The Toronto Daily Star. \\"[M]ere words fail utterly to describe even one scene of this mighty picture taken from the battlefields of France. Judging by the excitement and enthuasiasm created in its first Canadian showing, The Somme will undoubtedly duplicate its effect every time it is thrown on the screen. The Somme is more than a war picture. It deals with humanity in the war, the bitter and the sweet, the fineness and the hellishness, the friendliness and the hate. It is utterly free from hokum, but full of sentiment. It you are a red-blooded Britisher, you will not want to miss The Somme. It is something superb in motion pictures.\\" References Bibliography * Low, Rachael. History of the British Film, 1918-1929. George Allen & Unwin, 1971. * Wood, Linda. British Films 1927-1939.

History  The original ThunderCats show was animated in Japan while being produced, written and voice acted in the United States. The series was originally distributed by Rankin-Bass Productions' then parent company Telepictures Corporation, which would later merge with Lorimar Productions in February 1986. In January 1989, Lorimar-Telepictures was purchased by and folded into Warner Bros., whose television syndication arm would eventually assume distribution of the show; Warner Bros. has owned the rights to the series (and all Lorimar Telepictures programming) from that point on.  Later adaptations   Comics  There were also several comic book series produced. A ThunderCats comic book series based on the animated series was originally published by Marvel Comics through its Star Comics imprint in 1985, lasting for three years and twenty four issues.

Pigeon Hole Station () was until 2000 an outstation of Victoria River Downs. History The station was originally established in 1883 on Bilingara and Karranga native lands by Charles Fisher and Maurice Lyons, who also owned nearby Glencoe Station. The men stocked the property with 20,000 head of cattle that had been overlanded from Wilmot by Nat Buchanan. The lease had been granted by the South Australian government in December 1879 for an area of land . Fisher ran into monetary problems and following legal battles the property was awarded to Goldsbrough Mort & Co. Ltd in 1889. In early 1900 Goldsbrough sold the lease and the stock for ¬£27,500 to a syndicate consisting of Forrest, Emmanuel & Company and the Kidman Brothers. In 1893 the station was carrying an estimated herd of 23,000 cattle and by 1894 the station occupied an area of , carried 30,000 head of cattle and some 500 horses. The station was shipping cattle at this time to Batavia via Singapore along with other stations in the area, in 1894 the station shipped 2,205 head for which they were paid ¬£7717. By 1901 the station was carrying about 30,000 head of cattle. and by 1907 Victoria River Downs was stocked with an estimated 69,350 head of cattle. In 1902 a partnership between Sidney Kidman and the Emanuel brothers acquired the property which occupied an area of and was regarded as one of the largest cattle stations in the world. Sidney Kidman sold Victoria River Downs to Bovril Australian Estates in 1909 along with another two stations, one being Northcote and the other in Western Australia near Wyndham called Carlton Hill for a total of ¬£200,000. By 1923 the size of the property was estimated at making it the largest property in the Northern Territory at the time. In 1949 the Surveyor General of the Northern Territory, R. Miller, arrived to resume an area of from the eastern side of the property. Parts of the property have since been carved up leaving an area of . William Buckland, a Melbourne businessman, purchased the property in 1955 and then sold again in 1960 to Hooker Corporation. When changes were made to the lease in 1961 the Animal Production Branch approached the Hooker Pastoral Company to excise a small portion of the lease to establish a research station. The area was surrendered in 1963. It was named the Victoria river Research Station in 1965 but is commonly referred to as Kidman Springs. The research station commenced operations 1969. In 1984, the station was sold again, this time to Peter Sherwin for 11.6 million. Kerry Packer had sought to buy the property and had negotiated the sale agreement with Hooker but the Northern Territory government invoked its right of veto sale of large parcels of land and instead gave Sherwin approval. Packer acquired Newcastle Waters instead. Sherwin was subject to a takeover bid by Elders in 1988 and Elders gave a 17.4% share in the property to Robert Holmes a Court, by 1989 Holmes a Court owned all of Victoria River Downs which today trades as Heytesbury Beef.Jack Drake, The Wild West in Australia and America, Salisbury, Queensland: Boolarong Press 2012 ().

Cultural studies researchers generally investigate how cultural practices relate to wider systems of power associated with or operating through social phenomena, such as ideology, class structures, national formations, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, and generation. Cultural studies views cultures not as fixed, bounded, stable, and discrete entities, but rather as constantly interacting and changing sets of practices and processes.\\"Cultural studies\\" is not synonymous with either \\"area studies\\" or \\"ethnic studies,\\" although there are many cultural studies practitioners working in both area studies and ethnic studies programs and professional associations (e.g. American studies, Asian studies, African-American studies, Latina/o Studies, European studies, Latin American studies, etc.). The field of cultural studies encompasses a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives and practices. Although distinct from the discipline of cultural anthropology and the interdisciplinary field of ethnic studies, cultural studies draws upon and has contributed to each of these fields. Cultural studies was initially developed by British Marxist academics in the late 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and has been subsequently taken up and transformed by scholars from many different disciplines around the world. Cultural studies is avowedly and even radically interdisciplinary and can sometimes be seen as antidisciplinary. A key concern for cultural studies practitioners is the examination of the forces within and through which socially organized people conduct and participate in the construction of their everyday lives.Pain, R. and Smith, S. eds., 2008. Fear: Critical geopolitics and everyday life. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. Cultural studies combines a variety of politically engaged critical approaches drawn including semiotics, Marxism, feminist theory, ethnography, critical race theory, post-structuralism, postcolonialism, social theory, political theory, history, philosophy, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, communication studies, political economy, translation studies, museum studies and art history/criticism to study cultural phenomena in various societies and historical periods. Cultural studies seeks to understand how meaning is generated, disseminated, contested, bound up with systems of power and control, and produced from the social, political and economic spheres within a particular social formation or conjuncture. Important theories of cultural hegemony and agency have both influenced and been developed by the cultural studies movement, as have many recent major communication theories and agendas, such as those that attempt to explain and analyze the cultural forces related and processes of globalization. During the rise of neo-liberalism in Britain and the US, cultural studies both became a global movement, and attracted the attention of many conservative opponents both within and beyond universities for a variety of reasons. Some left-wing critics associated particularly with Marxist forms of political economy also attacked cultural studies for allegedly overstating the importance of cultural phenomena. While cultural studies continues to have its detractors, the field has become a kind of a worldwide movement of students and practitioners with a raft of scholarly associations and programs, annual international conferences and publications.B√©rub√©, Michael (2009), \\"What's the Matter with Cultural Studies?\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education.\\"Cultural Studies Associations, Networks and Programs\\", extensive, but incomplete, list of associations, networks and programs as found on the website for the Association of Cultural Studies, Tampere, Finland. Distinct approaches to cultural studies have emerged in different national and regional contexts. Characteristics In his 1994 book, Introducing Cultural Studies, orientalist scholar Ziauddin Sardar lists the following five main characteristics of cultural studies:Sardar, Ziauddin, and Borin Van Loon. 1994. Introducing Cultural Studies. New York: Totem Books *The objective of cultural studies is to understand culture in all its complex forms, and analyzing the social and political context in which culture manifests itself. *Cultural study is a site of both study/analysis and political criticism. For example, not only would a cultural studies scholar study an object, but they may also connect this study to a larger political project. *Cultural studies attempt to expose and reconcile constructed divisions of knowledge that purport to be grounded in nature. *Cultural studies has a commitment to an ethical evaluation of modern society. *One aim of cultural studies could be to examine cultural practices and their relation to power, following critical theory. For example, a study of a subculture (such as white working-class youth in London) would consider their social practices against those of the dominant culture (in this example, the middle and upper classes in London who control the political and financial sectors that create policies affecting the well-being of white working-class youth in London). British Cultural Studies There are numerous published accounts of the history of cultural studies. As Dennis Dworkin writes that \\"a critical moment\\" in the beginning of cultural studies as a field was when Richard Hoggart used the term in 1964 in founding the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS) at the University of Birmingham.Dworkin, Dennis. 1997. Cultural Marxism in Post-War Britain: History, the New Left, and the Origins of Cultural Studies. Durham: Duke University Press. p. 116. The Centre would become home to the development of the intellectual orientation that has become known internationally as the \\"Birmingham School\\" of cultural studies,see also: Corner, John. 1991. \\"Postscript: Studying Culture‚ÄîReflections and Assessment: An Interview with Richard Hoggart.\\" Media, Culture & Society 13(2). thus becoming the world's first institutional home of cultural studies. Hoggart appointed Stuart Hall as his assistant, who would effectively be directing CCCS by 1968.Davies, Ioan. 1991. \\"British Cultural Marxism.\\" International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society 4(3):323‚Äì44. p. 328. Hall formally assumed the directorship of CCCS in 1971, when Hoggart left Birmingham to become Assistant Director-General of UNESCO.Hoggart, Richard. 2011. An Idea and Its Servants: UNESCO from Within. Newark, NJ: Transaction Publishers. Thereafter, the field of cultural studies became closely associated with Hall's work. In 1979, Hall left Birmingham to accept a prestigious chair in sociology at the Open University, and Richard Johnson took over the directorship of the Centre. In the late 1990s, \\"restructuring\\" at the University of Birmingham led to the elimination of CCCS and the creation of a new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS) in 1999. Then, in 2002, the University's senior administration abruptly announced the disestablishment of CSS, provoking a substantial international outcry. The immediate reason for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university attributed the decision to \\"inexperienced ‚Äòmacho management‚Äô.\\" The RAE, a holdover initiative of the Margaret Thatcher-led British government of 1986, determines research funding for university programs.Curtis, Polly (2002), \\"Birmingham's cultural studies department given the chop.\\" The Guardian. To trace the development of British Cultural Studies, see, for example, the work of Richard Hoggart, E. P. Thompson, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, Angela McRobbie, Paul Gilroy, David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, Richard Dyer, and others. Stuart Hall's directorship of CCCS at Birmingham Beginning in 1964, after the initial appearance of the founding works of British Cultural Studies in the late 1950s, Stuart Hall's pioneering work at CCCS, along with that of his colleagues and postgraduate students gave shape and substance to the field of cultural studies. This would include such people as Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, David Morley, Charlotte Brunsdon, John Clarke, Richard Dyer, Judith Williamson, Richard Johnson, Iain Chambers, Dorothy Hobson, Chris Weedon, Tony Jefferson, Michael Green and Angela McRobbie. Many cultural studies scholars employed Marxist methods of analysis, exploring the relationships between cultural forms (i.e., the superstructure) and that of the political economy (i.e., the base). By the 1970s, the work of Louis Althusser radically rethought the Marxist account of base and superstructure in ways that had a significant influence on the \\"Birmingham School.\\" Much of the work done at CCCS studied youth-subcultural expressions of antagonism toward \\"respectable\\" middle-class British culture in the post- WWII period. Also during the 1970s, the politically formidable British working classes were in decline. Britain's manufacturing industries while continuing to grow in output and value, were decreasing in share of GDP and numbers employed, and union rolls were shrinking. Millions of working-class Britons backed the rise of Margaret Thatcher, through the labour losses. For Stuart Hall and his colleagues, this shift in loyalty from the Labour Party to the Conservative Party had to be explained in terms of cultural politics, which they had been tracking even before Thatcher's first victory. Some of this work was presented in the cultural studies classic, Policing the Crisis, and in other later texts such as Hall's The Hard Road to Renewal: Thatcherism and the Crisis of the Left, and New Times: The Changing Face of Politics in the 1990s. Late-1970s and beyond By the late 1970s, scholars associated with The Birmingham School had firmly placed questions of gender and race on the cultural studies agenda, where they have remained ever since. Also by the late 1970s, cultural studies had begun to attract a great deal of international attention. It spread globally throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As it did so, it both encountered new conditions of knowledge production, and engaged with other major international intellectual currents such as poststructuralism, postmodernism, and postcolonialism. The wide range of cultural studies journals now located throughout the world, as shown below, is one indication of the globalization of the field. Developments outside the UK In the US, prior to the emergence of British Cultural Studies, several versions of cultural analysis had emerged largely from pragmatic and liberal-pluralist philosophical traditions.Lindlof & Taylor, 2002, p. 60. However, in the late 1970s and 1980s, when British Cultural Studies began to spread internationally, and to engage with feminism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and race, critical cultural studies (i.e., Marxist, feminist, poststructuralist, etc.) expanded tremendously in American universities in fields such as communication studies, education, sociology, and literature. Cultural Studies, the flagship journal of the field, has been based in the US since its founding editor, John Fiske, brought it there from Australia in 1987. A thriving cultural studies scene has existed in Australia since the late 1970s, when several key CS practitioners emigrated there from the UK, taking British Cultural Studies with them, after Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister of the UK in 1979. A school of cultural studies known as cultural policy studies is one of the distinctive Australian contributions to the field, though it is not the only one. Australia also gave birth to the world's first professional cultural studies association (now known as the Cultural Studies Association of Australasia) in 1990. Cultural studies journals based in Australia include International Journal of Cultural Studies, Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies, and Cultural Studies Review. In Canada, cultural studies has sometimes focused on issues of technology and society, continuing the emphasis in the work of Marshall McLuhan, Harold Innis, and others. Cultural studies journals based in Canada include Topia: Canadian Journal of Cultural Studies. In Africa, human rights and Third-World issues are among the central topics treated. Cultural Studies journals based in Africa include the Journal of African Cultural Studies. In Latin America, cultural studies have drawn on thinkers such as Jos√© Mart√≠, √Ångel Rama, and other Latin-American figures, in addition to the Western theoretical sources associated with cultural studies in other parts of the world. Leading Latin American cultural studies scholars include N√©stor Garc√≠a Canclini, J√©sus Mart√≠n-Barbero, and Beatriz Sarlo. Among the key issues addressed by Latin American cultural studies scholars are decoloniality, urban cultures, and postdevelopment theory. Latin American cultural studies journals include the Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies. Even though cultural studies developed much more rapidly in the UK than in continental Europe, there is significant cultural studies presence in countries such as France, Spain, and Portugal. The field is relatively undeveloped in Germany, probably due to the continued influence of the Frankfurt School, which is now often said to be in its third generation, which includes notable figures such as Axel Honneth. Cultural studies journals based in continental Europe include the European Journal of Cultural Studies, the Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies, French Cultural Studies, and Portuguese Cultural Studies. In Germany, the term cultural studies specifically refers to the field in the Anglosphere, especially British Cultural Studies, to differentiate it from the German Kulturwissenschaft which developed along different lines and is characterized by its distance from political science. However, Kulturwissenschaft and cultural studies are often used interchangeably, particularly by lay people. Throughout Asia, cultural studies have boomed and thrived since at least the beginning of the 1990s. Cultural studies journals based in Asia include Inter- Asia Cultural Studies. In India, the Centre for Study of Culture and Society, Bangalore and the Department of Cultural Studies at The English and Foreign Languages and the University of Hyderabad are two major institutional spaces for Cultural Studies. Issues, concepts, and approaches Marxism has been an important influence upon cultural studies. Those associated with CCCS initially engaged deeply with the structuralism of Louis Althusser, and later in the 1970s turned decisively toward Antonio Gramsci. Cultural studies has also embraced the examination of race, gender, and other aspects of identity, as is illustrated, for example, by a number of key books published collectively under the name of CCCS in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including Women Take Issue: Aspects of Women's Subordination (1978), and The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s Britain (1982). Gramsci and hegemony To understand the changing political circumstances of class, politics, and culture in the United Kingdom, scholars at The Birmingham School turned to the work of Antonio Gramsci, an Italian thinker, writer, and Communist Party leader. Gramsci had been concerned with similar issues: why would Italian laborers and peasants vote for fascists? What strategic approach is necessary to mobilize popular support in more progressive directions? Gramsci modified classical Marxism, and argued that culture must be understood as a key site of political and social struggle. In his view, capitalists used not only brute force (police, prisons, repression, military) to maintain control, but also penetrated the everyday culture of working people in a variety of ways in their efforts to win popular \\"consent.\\" It is important to recognize that for Gramsci, historical leadership, or hegemony, involves the formation of alliances between class factions, and struggles within the cultural realm of everyday common sense. Hegemony was always, for Gramsci, an interminable, unstable and contested process. Scott Lash writes: Edgar and Sedgwick write: > The theory of hegemony was of central importance to the development of > British cultural studies [particularly The Birmingham School. It facilitated > the analysis of the ways subordinate groups actively resist and respond to > political and economic domination. The subordinate groups needed not to be > seen merely as the passive dupes of the dominant class and its > ideology.Edgar & Sedgewick, 165. Structure and agency The development of hegemony theory in cultural studies was in some ways consonant with work in other fields exploring agency, a theoretical concept that insists on the active, critical capacities of subordinated people (e.g. the working classes, colonized peoples, women). As Stuart Hall famously argued in his 1981 essay, \\"Notes on Deconstructing 'the Popular'\\": \\"ordinary people are not cultural dopes.\\" Insistence on accounting for the agency of subordinated people run counter to the work of traditional structuralists. Some analysts have however been critical of some work in cultural studies that they feel overstates the significance of or even romanticizes some forms of popular cultural agency. Cultural studies often concerns itself with the agency at the level of the practices of everyday life, and approaches such research from a standpoint of radical contextualism. In other words, cultural studies rejects universal accounts of cultural practices, meanings, and identities. Judith Butler, an American feminist theorist whose work is often associated with cultural studies, wrote that: > the move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to > structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of > hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, > and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of > structure. It has marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that > takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the > insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed > conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies > of the rearticulation of power. Globalization In recent decades, as capitalism has spread throughout the world via contemporary forms of globalization, cultural studies has generated important analyses of local sites and practices of negotiation with and resistance to Western hegemony. Cultural consumption Cultural Studies criticizes the traditional view of the passive consumer, particularly by underlining the different ways people read, receive and interpret cultural texts, or appropriate other kinds of cultural products, or otherwise participate in the production and circulation of meanings. On this view, a consumer can appropriate, actively rework, or challenge the meanings circulated through cultural texts. In some of its variants, cultural studies has shifted the analytical focus from traditional understandings of production to consumption - viewed as a form of production (of meanings, of identities, etc.) in its own right. Stuart Hall, John Fiske, and others have been influential in these developments. A special 2008 issue of the field's flagship journal, Cultural Studies, examined \\"anti-consumerism\\" from a variety of cultural studies angles. Jeremy Gilbert noted in the issue, cultural studies must grapple with the fact that \\"we now live in an era when, throughout the capitalist world, the overriding aim of government economic policy is to maintain consumer spending levels. This is an era when 'consumer confidence' is treated as the key indicator and cause of economic effectiveness.\\" The concept of \\"text\\" Cultural studies, drawing upon and developing semiotics, uses the concept of text to designate not only written language, but also television programs, films, photographs, fashion, hairstyles, and so forth; the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture. This conception of textuality derives especially from the work of the pioneering and influential semiotician, Roland Barthes, but also owes debts to other sources, such as Juri Lotman and his colleagues from Tartu‚ÄìMoscow School. Similarly, the field widens the concept of culture. Cultural studies approach the sites and spaces of everyday life, such as pubs, living rooms, gardens, and beaches, as \\"texts.\\" Culture, in this context, includes not only high culture,Bakhtin, Mikhail 1981. The Dialogic Imagination. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, p. 4. but also everyday meanings and practices, a central focus of cultural studies. Jeff Lewis summarized much of the work on textuality and textual analysis in his cultural studies textbook and a post-9/11 monograph on media and terrorism.Lewis, Jeff. 2008. Cultural Studies. London: SAGE.Lewis, Jeff. 2005. Language Wars: The Role of Media and Culture in Global Terror and Political Violence. London: Pluto Press. According to Lewis, textual studies use complex and difficult heuristic methods and require both powerful interpretive skills and a subtle conception of politics and contexts. The task of the cultural analyst, for Lewis, is to engage with both knowledge systems and texts and observe and analyze the ways the two interact with one another. This engagement represents the critical dimensions of the analysis, its capacity to illuminate the hierarchies within and surrounding the given text and its discourse. Academic reception Cultural studies has evolved through the confluence of various disciplines‚Äîanthropology, media studies, communication studies, Literary Studies, education, geography, philosophy, sociology, politics, and others. While some have accused certain areas of cultural studies of meandering into political relativism and a kind of empty version of \\"postmodern\\" analysis, others hold that at its core, cultural studies provides a significant conceptual and methodological framework for cultural, social, and economic critique. This critique is designed to \\"deconstruct\\" the meanings and assumptions that are inscribed in the institutions, texts, and practices that work with and through, and produce and re-present, culture. Thus, while some scholars and disciplines have dismissed cultural studies for its methodological rejection of disciplinarity, its core strategies of critique and analysis have influenced areas of the social sciences and humanities; for example, cultural studies work on forms of social differentiation, control and inequality, identity, community-building, media, and knowledge production has had a substantial impact. Moreover, the influence of cultural studies has become increasingly evident in areas as diverse as translation studies, health studies, international relations, development studies, computer studies, economics, archaeology, and neurobiology. Cultural studies has also diversified its own interests and methodologies, incorporating a range of studies on media policy, democracy, design, leisure, tourism, warfare, and development. While certain key concepts such as ideology or discourse, class, hegemony, identity, and gender remain significant, cultural studies has long engaged with and integrated new concepts and approaches. The field thus continues to pursue political critique through its engagements with the forces of culture and politics. The Blackwell Companion to Cultural Studies, edited by leading cultural studies scholar Toby Miller, contains essays that analyze the development of cultural studies approaches within each of a wide range of disciplines across the contemporary social sciences and humanities. Literary scholars Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or comparative literature. Nevertheless, some traditional literary scholars such as Yale professor Harold Bloom have been outspoken critics of cultural studies. On the level of methodology, these scholars dispute the theoretical underpinning of the movement's critical framework. Bloom stated his position during the 3 September 2000 episode of C-SPAN's Booknotes, while discussing his book How to Read and Why: Marxist literary critic Terry Eagleton is not wholly opposed to cultural studies, but has criticised aspects of it and highlighted what he sees as its strengths and weaknesses in books such as After Theory (2003). For Eagleton, literary and cultural theory have the potential to say important things about the \\"fundamental questions\\" in life, but theorists have rarely realized this potential. Sociology Cultural studies have also had a substantial impact on sociology. For example, when Stuart Hall left CCCS at Birmingham, it was to accept a prestigious professorship in Sociology at the Open University in Britain. The subfield of cultural sociology, in particular, is disciplinary home to many cultural studies practitioners. Nevertheless, there are some differences between sociology as a discipline and the field of cultural studies as a whole. While sociology was founded upon various historic works purposefully distinguishing the subject from philosophy or psychology, cultural studies have explicitly interrogated and criticized traditional understandings and practices of disciplinarity. Most CS practitioners think it is best that cultural studies neither emulate disciplines nor aspire to disciplinarity for cultural studies. Rather, they promote a kind of radical interdisciplinarity as the basis for cultural studies. One sociologist whose work has had a major influence on cultural studies is Pierre Bourdieu, whose work makes innovative use of statistics and in-depth interviews.Richard Harker, Cheleen Mahar, Chris Wilkes (eds), An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: The Theory of Practice. Houndmills: Macmillan, 1990, pp. 68-71. However, although Bourdieu's work has been highly influential within cultural studies, and although Bourdieu regarded his work as a form of science, cultural studies has never embraced the idea that it should aspire toward \\"scientificity,\\" and has marshalled a wide range of theoretical and methodological arguments against the fetishization of \\"scientificity\\" as a basis for cultural studies. Two sociologists who have been critical of cultural studies, Chris Rojek and Bryan S. Turner, argue in their article, \\"Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn,\\" that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus. Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies have always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity. Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above. Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is \\"a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated\\" in cultural studiesRojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner. 2000. \\"Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn.\\" The Sociological Review 48(4):629‚Äì48. Physics (Alan Sokal) In 1996, physicist Alan Sokal expressed his opposition to cultural studies by submitting a hoax article to a cultural studies journal, Social Text. The article, which was crafted as a parody of what Sokal referred to as the \\"fashionable nonsense\\" of postmodernism, was accepted by the editors of the journal, which did not at the time practice peer review. When the paper appeared in print, Sokal published a second article in a self-described \\"academic gossip\\" magazine, Lingua Franca, revealing his hoax on Social Text. Sokal stated that his motivation stemmed from his rejection of contemporary critiques of scientific rationalism:Sokal, Alan. 1996. \\"A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies,\\" translated by D. Sleator. NYU Department of Physics. In response to this provocation, Jacques Derrida wrote:Derrida, Jacques. 2005. \\"Sokal and Bricmont aren‚Äôt serious\\" In: J. Derrida (Ed.), R.

It is famous for its inclusion among Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus stories.Harris, Joel Chandler. Uncle Remus: His Songs and Sayings. Chapter XXIII. 1881. Although its folk roots most likely trace back to ancient Africa, the folktale's first written appearance was as a chapter titled \\"Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Bear\\" in Uncle Remus: His Songs and Sayings, published in 1881. Synopsis Like many short stories featuring Br'er Rabbit, the tale describes one of the trickster's successful attempts to talk his way out of a difficult situation. Br'er Rabbit is sneaking into Br'er Fox's garden to steal goober peas (peanuts) when he gets caught in a snare trap laid by Br'er Fox. Suspended awkwardly in mid-air, unable to free himself, he worries what will happen when Br'er Fox finds him caught in his trap. He then sees the notoriously slow-witted Br'er Bear approaching and quickly thinks of a way to trick Br'er Bear into freeing him. Feigning a cheerful complacency, he tells Br'er Bear that he is hanging there because Br'er Fox has been paying him \\"a dollar a minute\\" to act as a scarecrow for the garden. He offers to let Br'er Bear take over the \\"job\\". Excited by the promise of quick wealth, Br'er Bear gladly helps free Br'er Rabbit and takes his place in the trap. Br'er Rabbit laughs and scampers away before Br'er Bear realizes that he has been tricked. In popular culture The story was used in the movie Song of the South, along with \\"The Tar Baby\\" and \\"The Laughing Place\\", but with one difference; Brer Rabbit, instead of intending to steal some of Brer Fox's peanut crop, decided to run away, fed up with life at his briar patch, and while running away he happens to get caught in a snare trap set by Brer Fox, right at the edge of a cornfield. It is also referenced in the first dark ride scene of Splash Mountain, a log flume-style attraction at Disneyland, Orlando's Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland, based on Song of the South.

Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forces under the command of Stefan Czarniecki defeated the Swedish forces commanded by Charles X Gustav of Sweden. After the Battle of Golab, the Swedish army under King Charles X Gustav marched towards Lwow, where Polish forces concentrated, and where King Jan Kazimierz stayed. In early March 1656, Charles X Gustav received news that up to 20,000 Polish-Lithuanian soldiers concentrated in Red Ruthenia. The Swedish King realized that his forces were not adequate to face the enemy, so he ordered a retreat towards the San river. Furthermore, the Swedes were constantly attacked by Polish guerrilla forces. On March 11, first Swedish units reached the town of Jaroslaw, where they defeated a regiment of Hetman Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, which guarded the river crossings. Soon afterwards, the division of Stefan Czarniecki arrived in the area, surprising the Swedes, as they thought it had been destroyed in the Battle of Golab. In a skirmish, which took place near Wielkie Oczy, Czarniecki destroyed a 1,000 strong unit of the reiters, commanded by Colonel Peter Hammerskjold. Then he attacked Robert Douglas, Count of Skenninge, who came to rescue the reitars. The skirmish ended in a Swedish defeat, and Douglas with his soldiers fled to Jaroslaw. Soon afterwards, Czarniecki attacked the town itself, clashing with Swedish guards, who oversaw labourers working on improvements of the town fortifications. Since Charles Gustav was well aware of Czarniecki's presence, he called reinforcements from units stationed in local villages. Arrival of main Swedish forces resulted in Polish retreat into the local forests. The battle, or rather the series of skirmishes, had a significant impact on those Polish units, which still remained loyal to Charles Gustav. After the battle, several such regiments abandoned the Swedes, while Charles Gustav came to the conclusion that a further march towards southeast was fruitless. A tactical retreat towards Sandomierz was ordered, and soon afterwards, the Swedish army was encircled in the confluence of the San and the Vistula.

Its territory is now part of the Leningradsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History Although it was documented in 1326,Albinus, p. 267 Sackheim already existed as an Old Prussian farming village when the Teutonic Knights conquered Sambia in 1255 during the Prussian Crusade. The German name Sackheim was derived from the Prussian Sakkeim, meaning a village in cleared woodland.Gause I, p. 6 It was bordered by L√∂benicht to the west, Neue Sorge to the north, Sackheim Gate and the early 17th century city walls to the east, and the Pregel River to the south. Beyond the walls was the road to Liep. Few Germans lived in Sackheim during the Middle Ages; raftsmen from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania often stayed in the quarter,Gause I, p. 56 and much of K√∂nigsberg's Prussian Lithuanian population lived in Sackheim.Armstedt, p. 247 It received a court seal and was made a Freiheit, or suburb subordinated to K√∂nigsberg Castle, in 1578.Boetticher, p. 157 Sackheim's escutcheon depicted the Lamb of God with red standard on a green field. Sackheim endured fires in 1513, 1539, and 1575. It was especially damaged by a citywide conflagration on 11 November 1764.Armstedt, pp. 244-45 Altstadt, L√∂benicht, Kneiphof, and their respective suburbs were merged to form the united city of K√∂nigsberg in 1724. However, K√∂nigsberg Castle and its suburbs, including Sackheim, were included within the new city limits but remained under royal, not municipal, control.Gause II, p. 76 Sackheim was merged into the city during the St√§dteordnung of Stein on 19 November 1808 during the era of Prussian reforms.Gause II, p. 334 Working class Sackheim had one of the highest birth rates in the city at the start of the 20th century.Gause II, p. 760 Sackheim was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Locations Names for Sackheim's main thoroughfare included Sackheimerstra√üe, Sackheimer rechte Stra√üe, and after World War I simply Sackheim. Gebauhrstra√üe (formerly Sackheimer Hinterstra√üe), named after the manufacturer Carl J. Gebauhr, ran through southern Sackheim. Yorckstra√üe (formerly the Alte Reiferbahn), named after Field Marshal Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, was located in northern Sackheim. Churches in Sackheim included the Sackheim Church for German Lutherans, St. Elisabeth's Church for Lithuanian Lutherans, and the Propsteikirche for Catholics. The K√∂nigliches Waisenhaus, or Royal Orphanage, was designed by Joachim Ludwig Schulthei√ü von Unfried near Sackheim Gate. Founded by King Frederick I in 1701 and dedicated in 1703, it was maintained by the Order of the Black Eagle. Its Reformed church, the Waisenhauskirche, was used from 1705-1809.Albinus, p. 329 The Lazarett, a military hospital, opened on Yorckstra√üe in 1880.Albinus, p. 302 The city's eastern fire department was also located on Yorckstra√üe. The Ostpreu√üische Generallandschaftsdirektion, an institution which offered agricultural loans, was located on Landhofmeisterstra√üe by the border with the Anger district of L√∂benicht since 1806. On 5 February 1813 after the Convention of Tauroggen, the East Prussian estates met there with Count Dohna and Yorck to discuss the raising of troops for the War of the Sixth Coalition.Albinus, p. 234 They unanimously agreed to the raising of a reserve corps of 10,000 troops, a Landwehr of 20,000 troops, a Landsturm for local defense, and a volunteer cavalry regiment.Ehrhardt, p. 24 The Litauer Baum was a barricade of chained tree branches located at the entrance of the Pregel into the city, near the Litauer Wallgasse and the medieval city walls. Used to enforce tolls on ships arriving from the east (from the direction of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania),Frischbier, p. 58 the Litauer Baum was built in 1636.Gause I, p. 408 The H√∂llander Baum near Lizent in western K√∂nigsberg was a similar barricade. Near Sackheim Gate was the Kupferteich (copper pond), an artificial dam with a copper forge mill. In 1925 it was converted into a swimming pool. Reputation Sackheim had a poor reputation compared to Altstadt, L√∂benicht, and Kneiphof, the three towns of medieval K√∂nigsberg. A popular verse was as follows: > In der Altstadt die Macht > im Kneiphof die Pracht > im L√∂benicht der Acker > auf dem Sackheim der Racker. > > In Altstadt the power > in Kneiphof the pomp > in L√∂benicht the fields > in Sackheim the knacker.

Teute (eds) Through a Glass Darkly: Reflections on Personal Identity in Early America (University of North Carolina Press, 1997), pp. 40ff. Hall said she moved to London at the age of twelve and chose to change gender in 1625, ten years later. - after 1629), was an English intersex person and servant in colonial Virginia whose wearing of female attire and, on subsequent investigation, a liaison with a maid provoked public controversy in 1629. Hall was subjected to a physical inspection, and the case reached the Quarter Court at Jamestown, which ruled that Hall was both a man and a woman and must dress in male and female clothing simultaneously. Hall's given name is typically written as \\"Thomas(ine)\\" or \\"Thomas/ine\\" in scholarly literature on the case. Early life According to Hall's own account, Hall was born and christened Thomasine Hall in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Hall was raised as a femaleEllen Hartigan-O'Connor, Lisa G. Materson, The Oxford Handbook of American Women's and Gender History (2018, ), pages 315-316 and became skilled at traditional women's crafts, such as needlework. At the age of twelve, Hall was sent to London to live with an aunt, and lived there for ten years and observed the popularity among the aristocracy of crossover male and female fashion. These trends may have influenced Hall to break away from social norms. As a young adult in the early 1620s, Hall decided to adopt a man's hairstyle and \\"changed into the fashion of a man\\" in order to follow a brother into the all-male military service. Hall then served in the military in England and France. Hall returned home and returned, for a time, to needlework and other female social conventions, reverting to the lifestyle of Thomasine, before later moving to colonial Virginia. Resettlement Hearing of work opportunities in North America, Hall left England and settled in Jamestown. Hall supported themself by making bone lace and other needlework. Pursuing a different work opportunity, Hall relocated to the small settlement at Warrosquyoacke, Virginia, in an Indian village across from the James River, likely a village of fewer than 200 in the 1620s. Tobacco planters in need of workers preferred hiring men. Hall switched from Thomasine to Thomas to be hired as a male servant. In early 1628, Hall appears to have been arrested on a charge of receiving stolen goods, though there is a slight doubt about whether this is the same Thomas Hall.Norton, Mary Beth, \\"Communal Definitions of Gendered identity in Colonial America\\", Ronald Hoffman, Mechal Sobel, Fredrika J. Teute (eds) Through a Glass Darkly: Reflections on Personal Identity in Early America, UNC Press, 1997, pp. 40ff. Hall was living with a John and Jane Tyos. It was claimed that Hall and the Tyoses had encouraged a neighbor to commit theft and sell the stolen goods to them. The property was found in the Tyoses' house. Local controversy Hall was not strict about presenting consistently as male in this new environment. Hall occasionally wore female clothing, which confused neighbors, masters, and captains of plantations. When queried about wearing women's clothes, Hall replied: \\"I goe in womans apparel to get a bitt for my Catt\\", apparently meaning that it allowed Hall to have sexual relations with men. Sometimes, even when presenting as Thomasine, Hall was rumored to be having sexual relations with women. For example, stories spread that Hall had sexual relations with the maid nicknamed \\"Great Besse\\", who worked for the former governor of Virginia, Richard Bennett. This was an issue of criminal responsibility; as a male, Hall could be prosecuted for sexual misconduct with a servant. Hall accused a woman called Alice Long of spreading the rumor, but Long said that the story originated with Hall's previous employers the Tyoses. Residents of Warrosquyoacke claimed that Hall's changes of dress and sexual relations with members of both sexes were causing disorder. Lacking a local court or church, some of them tried to determine Hall's anatomical sex for themselves. In this era, married women were considered the best resources for understanding the female body. Three women‚ÄìAlice Long, Dorothy Rodes, and Barbara Hall‚Äìdecided to examine Hall's anatomy. More than once, they entered Hall's home while Hall slept and observed Hall's genitalia. They decided that Hall lacked a \\"readable set of female genitalia\\" and persuaded Hall's plantation master, John Atkins, to confirm their determination. Atkins had previously claimed that Hall was female but, after inspecting Hall during sleep, agreed that Hall was male, having seen \\"a small piece of flesh protruding from [Hall's] body\\". Hall apparently claimed also to have female anatomy, described as \\"a peece of an hole\\", but Atkins and the women said that they could find no evidence of this. Atkins ordered Hall to wear exclusively male clothing and urged the most prominent tobacco planter in the village, Captain Nathanial Bass, to punish Hall. Bass confronted Hall and bluntly asked if Hall was a man or a woman. Hall claimed to be both, \\"although he had what appeared to be a small penis\\". Hall said that it was only an inch (2.5 cm) long and was not functional. Male incompetence was considered sufficient to determine female sex during the early modern colonial period, and Bass decided that Hall was not properly a man. This meant that Hall could not be prosecuted for debauching Besse. The Quarter Court The villagers decided to take the case to the Quarter Court of Jamestown, just as Christians in Europe did in similar situations. As described by Reis, a \\"solution consistent with scripture-based laws as interpreted by Talmudic commentaries and consonant with early modern European customs\\" was to make an individual choose either male or female gender. Hall's case reached the Quarter Court on April 8, 1629. Governor John Pott presided and the court heard from several witnesses, as well as from Hall. In a departure from similar European cases, the court ruled that Hall had a \\"dual nature\\" gender, or what modern society classifies as intersex: \\"hee is a man and a woeman\\". Before Hall's time, any individual determined by court to be \\"man and woman\\" was forced to adopt either a permanent male or female identity. Instead, as punishment for Hall's previous gender ambiguity and alternating identities as a man and a woman, the court denied Hall the freedom to choose a single gender identity. As a form of public ridicule, Hall was forced to \\"goe clothed in man's apparell, only his head to bee attired in a coyfe and croscloth with an apron before him\\". In addition, Hall had to provide evidence of good behavior to each Quarter Court. Nothing further is known about Hall's life or about how long the dual-gendered clothing rule was applied. Significance Taylor states that, in the early modern period, medical theorists and scientists considered that women were not a separate sex but \\"a flawed variant of men\\". They believed that male organs were tucked inside of women because they did not have enough heat to develop external genitalia. They believed that strenuous physical activity or even \\"mannish behavior\\" could cause testicles to exit from inside the vagina. Since they believed men were perfect individuals, they explained this by stating it was \\"nature's unerring tendency toward a state of greater perfection\\". Because they did not have clear definitions for anatomical sex categories, they relied on \\"performing\\" gender through consistent dress, names, occupations, and sexual relationships. Hall, defying this practice by using the clothes and names of both, has been cited as an early example of \\"a gender nonconforming individual in colonial America\\".Sarah Boslaugh, Transgender Health Issues (2018, ), page 165Laura Erickson-Schroth, Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community (2014, ), pages 503-504. However, early common law, consistent with canon law, held that the sex of an intersex individual (formerly termed an hermaphrodite), depended on the sex that predominates. The 12th-century Decretum Gratiani states that \\"Whether an hermaphrodite may witness a testament, depends on which sex prevails\\", while Henry de Bracton's De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (\\"On the Laws and Customs of England\\"), c. 1235,Henry de Bracton. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 17 March 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online states that, \\"A hermaphrodite is classed with male or female according to the predominance of the sexual organs.\\" Reis states that the novel solution required by the court was a deliberate form of punishment, \\"not to endorse uncertainty, but to preclude future acts of deception, to mark the offender, and to warn others against similar abomination. The dual-sexed Hall embodied an impermissible category of gender.\\" She states that making Hall a public spectacle would have been devastating and limiting of Hall's personhood, and this radical act contradicts not only earlier legal accounts, but also later legal and medical responses to hermaphroditism.

The text of the Seminar, which was held by Jacques Lacan at the Hospital of Sainte-Anne in Paris between the Fall of 1954 and the Spring of 1955 and is the second one in the series, was established by Jacques-Alain Miller and translated by Sylvana Tomaselli. Background In July 1953, the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Psychanalyse (with Jacques Lacan, Fran√ßoise Dolto and Serge Leclaire) secedes from the Soci√©t√© Psychanalytique de Paris (member of the International Psychoanalytical Association) over growing tensions between the practice of Lacan and his contemporaries and the emerging ego psychology trend of the previous generation.Copjec, J. \\"Dossier on the Institutional Debate: An introduction\\" in Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment Nevertheless, the S.F.P. is allowed to be present in at the Congress of Rome in the summer of 1953 where Lacan delivers his report: \\"The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis\\".Jacques Lacan, √âcrits. The positive reception of the expression \\"the return to Freud\\" and of his report and discourse in Rome give Lacan the will to reelaborate all the analytical concepts. In the Fall of 1953 he starts his seminars at the Hospital of Sainte-Anne every Wednesday and presents cases of patients on Fridays.David Macey Lacan in Contexts (1988). Contents In Seminar II Lacan deliberates on the distinction made in his first seminar between discourse analysis and the analysis of the ego, both in relation to psychoanalytical theory and practice. He claims that \\"analysis deals with resistances.\\" He reviews three works by Freud: Beyond the pleasure principle (on the death drive),Sigmund Freud, S.E. XVIII, 1920 Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego,Sigmund Freud, S.E. XVIII, 1921 and The Ego and the Id.Sigmund Freud, S.E. XIX, 1923 Consciousness is transparent to itself, whereas the I (je) is not. The I is outside the field of consciousness and its certainties (where we represent ourselves as ego, where something exists and is expressed by the I). But it is not enough to say that \\"the I of the unconscious is not the ego\\" since we tend to think this I as the true ego. Lacan proceeds to re-assert the locus of the ego and reinstate the excentricity of the subject vis-√†-vis the ego. The ego is a particular object within the experience of the subject, with a certain function: an imaginary one. When in the specular image the ego is recognized as such by the subject, this image becomes self-conscious. \\"The mirror stage is based on the rapport between, on one hand, a certain level of tendencies which are experienced as disconnected and, on the other, a unity with which it is merged and paired. In this unity the subject knows itself as unity, but as an alienated, virtual one.\\" However, for a consciousness to perceive another consciousness, the symbolic order must intervene on the system determined by the image of the ego, as a dimension of re-connaissance. In \\"The Dream of Irma's Injection\\" the most tragic moment occurs in the confrontation with the Real. The ultimate Real, \\"something in front of which words stop.\\" \\"In the dream the unconscious is what is outside all of the subjects. The structure of the dream shows that the unconscious is not the ego of the dreamer.\\" \\"This subject outside the subject designates the whole structure of the dream.\\" \\"What is at stake in the function of the dream is beyond the ego, what in the subject is of the subject and not of the subject, that is the unconscious.\\" In his analysis of Poe's Purloined Letter, Lacan speaks of \\"an other beyond all subjectivity.\\" The question concerns the \\"confrontation of the subject beyond the ego with the Id, the quod (what-is-it?) which seeks to come into being in analysis.\\" \\"The purloined letter is synonymous with the original, radical subject of the unconscious. The symbol is being displaced in its pure state: one cannot come into contact with without being caught in its play. There is nothing in destiny, or casualty, which can be defined as a function of existence. When the characters get hold of this letter, something gets hold of them and carries them along. At each stage of the symbolic transformation of the letter, they will be defined by their position in relation to this radical object. This position is not fixed. As they enter into the necessity peculiar to the letter, they each become functionally different to the essential reality of the letter. For each of them the letter is the unconscious, with all its consequences, namely that at each point of the symbolic circuit, each of them becomes someone else.\\" When Jean Hyppolite asks: \\"What use does the Symbolic have?\\" Lacan answers: \\"The Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real are useful in giving its meaning to a particularly pure symbolic experience, that of analysis.\\" Since the symbolic dimension is the only dimension that cures, \\"The symbolic order is simultaneously non-being and insisting to be, that is what Freud has in mind when he talks about the death instinct as being what is most fundamental: a symbolic order in travail, in the process of coming, insisting in being realized.\\" center The Schema L, systematized in La lettre vol√©e (√âcrits, 1966), is elaborated in this seminar. A four-term structure maps the Real, the Imaginary and the Symbolic as replacing the second Freudian topography: ego/id/superego. Two diagonals intersect, while the imaginary rapport links a (the ego) to a' (the other), the line going from S (the subject, the Freudian id) to A (the Other) is interrupted by the first one. The Other is difficult to define: it is the place of language where subjectivity is constituted; it is the place of primal speech linked to the Father; it is the place of the absolute Other, the mother in the demand. The Other makes the subject without the subject knowing it. With Lacan in Freud's Wo Es war, soll Ich werden, Es is the subject. \\"It\\" knows him or doesn't. The further, more exacting insight, is \\"It\\" speaks or doesn't. At the end of analysis, it is \\"It\\" who must be called on to speak, and to enter in relation with real Others. Where S was, there the Ich should be.

It is anchored by Dick's Sporting Goods, and Burlington. History The mall opened in 1967 as an open-air strip including W.T. Grant, Town & Country (a discount chain then owned by Lane Bryant), Sears, and Food Fair. In 1969 and 1970, it underwent reconstruction to become an enclosed shopping mall, with The Bon-Ton moving from an existing store downtown and JCPenney joining. The Town & Country store became Kmart, which moved out in 1996 and became Black Rose Antiques. The Bon-Ton moved out in 2006. After Black Rose Antiques moved out of the mall, construction began in 2007 to demolish the former Black Rose building for a Dick's Sporting Goods, while also demolishing the former Bon- Ton for a two-story Boscov's. Although Boscov's was originally to open in 2008, its opening date was later pushed back to 2009, but in April of that year, the mall's manager confirmed that Boscov's would not be opening in that space. In 2012, JCPenney moved into the space originally planned for Boscov's. Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust announced on September 9, 2014 that it sold the North Hanover Mall, as well as State College's Nittany Mall, for a combined $32.3 million. The name of the buyer was not immediately available, and a trust spokesperson was not available for comment. Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust owns and manages malls in 12 states in the eastern United States. It sold the North Hanover Mall as part of a portfolio- improvement initiative it launched in 2012, which involved selling underperforming properties. The 452,000-square-foot North Hanover Mall had sales of $275 per square foot at the end of June and a non-anchor occupancy of 72.8 percent, according to the trust. Sales and occupancy at the mall lagged the trust's portfolio, which had averaged sales of $378 per square foot and non-anchor occupancy of 89.5 percent for the same time period. The buyer of the mall was Mason Asset Management of Great Neck, New York. On January 4, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. On June 4, 2020, JCPenney announced that this location would be closing on October 18, 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide which left Burlington and Dick's Sporting Goods as the only anchors left.https://companyblog.jcpnewsroom.com/storeclosings/ References External links * North Hanover Mall Category:Buildings and structures in York County, Pennsylvania Category:Shopping malls established in 1967 Category:Shopping malls in Pennsylvania Category:Tourist attractions in York County, Pennsylvania Category:Hanover, Pennsylvania ","title":"North Hanover Mall"},{"id":"37961951","text":"NHB or nhb may refer to: * No holds barred (disambiguation), a term originating in catch wrestling that has also been applied to modern mixed martial arts * National Heritage Board (Singapore), a cultural development board * National Housing Bank, a state owned bank in India * Naval Hospital Bremerton, a United States Navy hospital in Bremerton, Washington * New Headquarters Building (NHB), part of the George Bush Center for Intelligence * nhb, the ISO 639-3 designation for the Beng language ","title":"NHB"},{"id":"37961959","text":"Cardal may refer to: * Cardal, Uruguay * Cardal Publishing, a British magazine and comic publisher * Jaroslav Cardal (1919-2010), Czechoslovakian cross country skier See also * Cardale (disambiguation) * Caudal (disambiguation) * Kardal ","title":"Cardal"},{"id":"37961980","text":"KUYY is a radio station airing an Adult Top 40 format licensed to Emmetsburg, Iowa, broadcasting on 100.1 MHz FM.

Hansen also served as a member of the town's Finance Committee. In 1964 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the board of selectmen. In 1965 he was named town moderator. In 1967, he was hired as a junior engineering aid in the Essex County engineer's office. Board of selectmen That same year he was elected to the board of selectmen and named its chairman. During his first year on the board, the selectmen voted 4 to 0 to suspend and fire Town Manager John O. Stinson due to the town's \\"sky-rocketing tax rate\\" and Stinson's \\"cool indifference\\" to the board of selectmen. Stanley Day, the head of a local engineering firm, was selected by the board to serve as temporary town manager. On July 31, the board chose Paul H. Boucher over Day in a 3 to 2 vote for the permanent job, with Hansen voting for Boucher. Hansen was reelected in 1967. On February 20, 1968, the board of selectmen voted unanimously not to renew Boucher's contract. To replace him, the board selected Clarence Wilkinson over former Keene, New Hampshire City Manager Frank A. Saia by 3 to 2 vote, with Hansen voting for Saia. He was reelected again in 1969, but chose not run for reelection in 1971 so he could accept the position of town accountant. Town accountant From 1971 to 1987, Hansen served as Saugus' town accountant. While in this position, Hansen also served as temporary town manager from 1973 to 1974, 1977 to 1978, in 1981, and in 1987. Town manager From 1987 to 1990, Hansen served as town manager of Saugus. During his tenure, Hansen attempted to eliminate the town's debt, he suspended two police officers for \\"engaging in unlawful sexual activity while on duty\\", the town put in new water and sewer lines, and town employees elected to move to a four-day workweek instead of facing layoffs. After Hansen left office he returned to his former position of town accountant. Personal life and death Hansen was married for 62 years to Evelyn N. (Pratt) Hansen, the daughter of C. F. Nelson Pratt. The couple had five children. Evelyn Hansen died on May 6, 2009. Hansen died on October 27, 2014, in Newburyport, Massachusetts.

Life Alexander Seton was the second son of Sir William Seton of Seton and his wife, Janet Fleming.A manuscript in the British Museum styles Sir William Seaton as \\"Wilhelmus primus dominus Seton\\" and other documents confirm this title. The date of this creation of the premier baronage of Scotland, is dated to sometime before 1393. A singular mistake in this record has Sir William Seaton marrying Catherine, daughter of Sir William St. Clair of Herdmanston. The Complete Peerage [vol. vi, p. 1, footnote (a)] corrects this to Janet Fleming, daughter of Sir David Fleming of Gibbar & Cumbernauld. They had two sons, John, who succeeded his father‚Äîit was he who married Catherine Sinclair (St. Clair)‚Äîand Alexander who married Elizabeth Gordon, heiress of Gordon. The Gordons were originally from Normandy, the founder of the family coming to Scotland in the twelfth century, probably in the train of David I of Scotland, and received a grant of the lands of Gordon in Berkshire.

It was also occasionally known as Altrossgarten (Altro√ügarten) to differentiate it from Neurossgarten in northwestern K√∂nigsberg. Its territory is now part of the Leningradsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia. History K√∂nigstra√üe Rossgarten was first mentioned as the Ro√ü- und Rindergarten (horse and cattle pasture) in the 1300 town charter of L√∂benicht.Albinus, p. 265 It grew to encompass the eastern shore of the Schlossteich and reached the southern shore of the Oberteich. Neighboring districts were Burgfreiheit to the southwest, Neue Sorge to the south, the Herzogsacker fields to the east, and the 17th century K√∂nigsberg fortifications to the north. Located outside of the walls was Kalthof to the east and the Pferderennbahn, or horse racing track, in Carolinenhof to the northeast. According to observations by Caspar Hennenberger, in 1539 the territory was still undeveloped, with an inn and warehouses the only buildings of note. In 1540 Albert I, Duke of Prussia, approved development of a new suburb known first as Neue Huben and then as Ro√ügarten. It was declared a Freiheit subordinate to K√∂nigsberg Castle in 1542. East Prussian noble families who lived in Rossgarten included the Buddenbrock, Gr√∂ben, G√∂tzen, Kunheim, Ostau, Rauter, Schlieben, and Tettau.Gause I, p. 412 Many Dutch linen weavers settled in the new suburb by 1553.Gause I, p. 312 Latvian merchants also settled in Rossgarten.Armstedt, p. 247 As the quarter expanded, Rossgarten was divided into southern Vorder- Ro√ügarten (\\"nearer Rossgarten\\") and northern Hinter-Ro√ügarten (\\"further Rossgarten\\"). In 1576 Vorder-Ro√ügarten received its court seal depicting a grazing white horse in a green pasture from Duke Albert Frederick. Hinter- Ro√ügarten's seal, which depicted a black bull in a green meadow with a blue field, was granted in 1596 by Margrave George Frederick. Altstadt, L√∂benicht, Kneiphof, and their respective suburbs were merged to form the united city of K√∂nigsberg in 1724. However, K√∂nigsberg Castle and its suburbs, including Rossgarten, were included within the new city limits but remained under royal, not municipal, control.Gause II, p. 76 Rossgarten was merged into the city during the St√§dteordnung of Stein on 19 November 1808 during the era of Prussian reforms.Gause II, p. 334 Much of Rossgarten was destroyed by the 1944 bombing of K√∂nigsberg in World War II and the 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Locations Krankenhaus der Barmherzigkeit Rossgarten's main marketplace was Ro√üg√§rter Markt, located at the intersection of Vorder-Ro√ügarten and K√∂nigstra√üe near Burgfreiheit's Burgkirche. In the Middle Ages it was known as Vorm Heiligen Kreuz, named after a nearby monastery used as a casting house for the Teutonic Knights during the era of Frederick of Saxony. Vorder- Ro√ügarten's eponymous thoroughfare began at Ro√üg√§rter Markt and ran northeast until Strift-Stra√üe, where it became Hinter-Ro√ügarten. The latter ended at Rossgarten Gate, part of the city walls. The St√§dtische Krankenhaus was a hospital in western Hinter-Ro√ügarten which had 24 beds upon opening in 1797 and 120 beds by 1811. The Krankenhaus der Barmherzigkeit was another hospital created through the initiative of Lt. General Bernhard Joachim von Plehwe and two daughters of Commanding General Friedrich zu Dohna. In 1848 it opened in eastern Hinter-Ro√ügarten with three deaconesses from Kaiserswerth.Albinus, p. 82 Reflecting the increasing influence of K√∂nigsberg's labor movement, the Gewerkschafthaus was inaugurated in Vorder-Ro√ügarten in May 1914. The spacious three-story building was designed by Waldemar Kuckuck and contained offices for political parties and trade unions. The hall contained a bust of the socialist leader Ferdinand Lassalle. Its coffeehouse, the Kaffeegarten, had a pleasant view over the Schlossteich.Albinus, p. 103 The city's social democratic newspaper, the K√∂nigsberger Volkszeitung, was published in the Gewerkschafthaus. The building was occupied by the Nazi Party during Gleichschaltung and renamed the Braunes-Haus. The Generalkommando was located in Vorder-Ro√ügarten with a garden reaching the Schlossteich. It was originally the 18th century Musenhof der Keyserlings, a palace owned by the counts of Keyserling, who were patrons of the arts. In 1809 it was acquired by King Frederick William III for use as the Kronprinzenpalais for the crown prince. It became a military headquarters in 1814 and then the official residence of the commanding general in 1830.Albinus, p. 99 Another military building was Hinter-Ro√ügarten's Kommandantur.Albinus, p. 166 Herzogsacker, once part of Kalthof's fields, was known as Marschallsacker in 1695 when it was given to the Duke (Herzog) of Holstein-Beck and renamed in his honor.Albinus, p. 126 Herzogsacker contained the stadium of SV Concordia K√∂nigsberg, a parade ground, and numerous cemeteries. The Stadthalle, now the Kaliningrad Regional Museum of History and Arts, was a performing arts center in Vorder-Ro√ügarten. It included concert halls (K√∂rtesaal, Krohnesaal, and Gebauhrsaal), a restaurant, and a garden cafe by the Schlossteich.

The MRAD is based on the Barrett 98B with a number of modifications and improvements. The Barrett MRAD was named the 2012 Rifle of the Year by the NRA. Design Shooting a Barrett MRAD chambered for .308 Winchester with suppressor. Israel Defense Forces snipers shooting a Barrett MRAD chambered for 7.62x51 mm NATO, achieving accuracy of around 0.35 MOA. After the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) announced their desire for a new precision sniper rifle in December 2009, Barrett created the MRAD in accordance with the specifications laid out by SOCOM. Building off of the successful Barrett 98B, the MRAD features multiple improvements such as a folding stock which allows the rifle to be transported more easily. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle which increases the security of transporting the rifle without increasing the width as unfolded. A major MRAD feature (and requirement of the military PSR solicitation) is a user field changeable barrel/caliber capability. Loosening two Torx screws in the receiver allows removal of the barrel from the front of the receiver/handguard. With only a simple bolt face change, and in some cases a magazine change, caliber may be changed. The factory headspaced bolt face is provided with each barrel. Barrel/caliber change can occur in less than two minutes. In addition to the typical military requested calibers of .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum, and .308 Winchester calibers, Barrett also offers popular caliber conversion kits in .338 and .300 NORMA, 7mm Remington, .260 Remington, and 6.5mm Creedmoor. Barrel lengths are offered in 17\\" to 26\\", but not in all calibers. Barrels are available in fluted and heavy profiles. The trigger module can be removed without tools providing access to user adjustable trigger pull weight and over travel, and making cleaning easier. Additional features of the MRAD include a single-button length-of-pull adjustment, adjustable cheek rest height, a polymer bolt guide acts as a dust cover to reduce debris entering the action, a user reversible AR-15 style safety, an ambidextrous magazine release, and the ability to accept standard M16/AR15 style pistol grips. Early MRADs had 30MOA slope full length 21.75\\" standard 1913 Picatinny rail on top of the receiver/handuard. Current MRADs feature 20 MOA slope rail. Shorter 2\\"-4\\" Picatinny rails sections may be user positioned at 3, 6, and 9 0'clock at several fore/aft positions along the handguard. MRADs are offered in several Cerakote colors; all barrels are black.Barrett product sales literature; Barrett website; MRAD Owner's Manual and Barrett Armorer's Course Similar to the M16/AR15 rifle, the MRAD upper and lower receivers can be separated by pushing out rear and front two take-down pins. Pushing out only the rear take-down pin allows the upper receiver to tilt on its front take-down pin like an AR to allow for easy maintenance in the field. With match grade .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition the MRAD is capable of 0.5 MOA (minute of angle) accuracy at a distances of up to 1500 meters. With standard ammunition the accuracy drops to near 1 MOA but still sub- MOA.Barrett MRAD, Shooting Illustrated.

It is visible to the naked eye as a yellow-white hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.22. This object is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +14 km/s. It displays a relatively high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at the rate of per year. Based upon a stellar classification of F2 III, this matches an aging giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and is evolving away from the main sequence. It is a possible pulsating Delta Scuti variable, although there is some uncertainty about this classification. However, Kunzli and North (1998) found no variation. The star is 1.44 billion years old with 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and 3.2 times the Sun's radius. It shows a high rotation rate with a projected rotational velocity of 149 km/s, which is causing an equatorial bulge that is an estimated 24% larger than the polar radius. 16 Persei is radiating 23 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 7,004 K.

He also received training as a railroad engineer and as a construction engineer for water and sewage plants.‚ÄúJohn R. Baylis.‚Äù (1963). Journal AWWA. 55:12 P&R; 40 and 42. Career Baylis‚Äôs first professional assignment (about 1905) was as manager of the Jackson, MI water works. In 1917 he was hired as a bacteriologist at the Montebello Filter Plant in Baltimore, MD. His tenure there was only nine years and when he left he was the principal sanitary chemist with the department. During his employment at Baltimore he developed a pH meter based on a tungsten wire. The Baltimore water treatment plant was one of the first to use pH for process control.Baylis, John R. (1923). ‚ÄúTungsten Wire for Hydrogen-Ion Determinations.‚Äù Ind. Eng.

Civil Engrs. 85: paper 1488. 502-4. About 1927, he moved his family to Chicago where he was put in charge of water purification research for the city. His job title was chemist, but he developed many of the advances in water treatment during the 1930s and 1940s.‚Äú50 Years with the Illinois Section.‚Äù (1959). Illinois Section of the American Water Works Association. These advances included: *Preventing corrosion of pipes *Filter bed cleaning with a fixed-grid surface wash system *Developing activated silica as a coagulant aid *Invention of a low-level turbidimeter *Initiation of lime use for pH adjustment *Pioneering the development of high rate filtration (2 to 5 gallons per minute/square foot) *Building an experimental treatment facility to study water purification methods *Understanding the causes and cures of taste and odor problems in drinking water In 1938, Baylis was put in charge of the design of the South District Filtration Plant, which was completed in 1943. He was in charge of the operation of the plant and was named engineer of water purification in 1942, which he held until his death. In 1935, he wrote a book entitled Elimination of Taste and Odor in Water. The work became a classic in the field of sanitary engineering and paved the way for others to control taste and odor problems. The book goes into some detail on how and where to feed powdered activated carbon (PAC) for taste and odor control. Perhaps his greatest achievement was the development of PAC. Up until Baylis‚Äôs work, activated carbon was only available in granular form which was used in a filtration mode. PAC could be formed into a slurry and fed like any other chemical into the treatment process. He received a U.S. patent for PAC as well as for other water treatment advances. Baylis was one of the first sanitary engineers to raise concerns about open finished water reservoirs. On November 3, 1938, he testified at a public service commission hearing in Milwaukee. He called the open Kilburn park reservoir a ‚Äúsource of danger‚Äù to the health of the city. Baylis said that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the reservoir should be roofed to prevent pollution from birds, insects, rodents, small animals, dirt, soot, leaves and other debris which he said was in the open water.‚ÄùPost-Crescent (Appleton, Wisconsin). ‚ÄúReservoir Is Termed ‚ÄòDanger‚Äô to Health.‚Äù November 3, 1938. It would take many decades before his concerns were codified into a USEPA regulation that deals specifically with this danger to human health. Personal life He married Pearl F. Spencer, a young woman from Mississippi, about 1920. They had two children, Josephine born in 1922 and John Robert Baylis Jr. born in 1927. Professional associations Baylis was active in the American Water Works Association. He was elected Chairman of the Illinois Section of AWWA in 1932 and he became the Section Secretary from 1915 to 1919. Honors and awards Baylis received the George Warren Fuller Award In 1939, and in 1971, he was one of the first five men inducted into the American Water Works Association Water Industry Hall of Fame.AWWA Water Industry Hall of Fame, American Water Works Association, Accessed December 16, 2012. In 1946, Baylis was made an honorary member of AWWA. In 1932, he was the first person awarded the John M. Goodell Prize from AWWA. Now called the Publications Award, it is conferred on the author of the best paper published that year in the Journal AWWA. He was given the James Laurie Prize by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1927. The award was established to recognize contributions to the advancement of transportation engineering, either in research, planning, design, or construction. Baylis was awarded a Commendation for Meritorious Service by the Northwestern Technological Institute in 1951. He was given the Distinguished Service Award from the American Chemical Society on September 18, 1958. In 1970, Mayor Richard J. Daley dedicated the John R.

History Tragheim was first documented in 1299,Karl, p. 153 but probably already existed as an Old Prussian farming village in 1255 when the Teutonic Knights conquered Sambia during the Prussian Crusade. The German name Tragheim was derived from the Prussian Trakkeim, meaning a village in a forest clearing (similar to Trakehnen).Gause I, p. 6 Germans were a minority in the village along the Schlossteich and the Oberteich during the Middle Ages; by 1535 Prussian Lithuanians were also documented in Tragheim.Gause I, p. 56 Tragheim became a Freiheit suburb under the control of K√∂nigsberg Castle, receiving its own court in 1528Albinus, p. 317 and its own seal in 1577.Armstedt, Geschichte p. 166 Its coat of arms depicted a brown deer's head between two green fir trees on a blue field. While Tragheim had been excluded from medieval K√∂nigsberg's walls, the village was included within the greater Baroque fortifications constructed during the 1620s. Neighboring quarters were the Lustgarten and Burgfreiheit to the south, Steindamm to the west, the city walls to the north, the Oberteich to the northeast, and the Schlossteich to the east. Farther to the north beyond the walls was the village of Tragheimsdorf and the heath known as the Tragheimer Palve. Altstadt, L√∂benicht, Kneiphof, and their respective suburbs were merged to form the united city of K√∂nigsberg in 1724. However, K√∂nigsberg Castle and its suburbs, including Tragheim, were included within the new city limits but remained under royal, not municipal, control.Gause II, p. 76 Tragheim was merged into the city during the St√§dteordnung of Stein on 19 November 1808 during the era of Prussian reforms.Gause II, p. 334 By 1890 the area from Neurossgarten's Wagnerstra√üe through Steindamm to Tragheimer Pulverstra√üe was the most densely settled part of the city.Armstedt, Heimatkunde p. 22 During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, many of K√∂nigsberg's affluent citizens moved from Tragheim to the new suburbs of Amalienau and Maraunenhof. In the same era Tragheim also had K√∂nigsberg's lowest birth rate.Gause II, p. 760 Tragheim Gate in the city walls was dismantled in 1911 to increase traffic and development in northern K√∂nigsberg.Gause II, p. 650 Tragheim was heavily damaged by the 1944 Bombing of K√∂nigsberg and 1945 Battle of K√∂nigsberg. Locations As Tragheim grew, it was divided into western VordertragheimKarl, p. 163 (\\"nearer Tragheim\\"), central MitteltragheimKarl, p. 106 (\\"middle Tragheim\\"), and eastern HintertragheimKarl, p. 65 (\\"further Tragheim\\"). The main thoroughfare in Vordertragheim was Tragheimer Kirchenstra√üe, which was named after the Lutheran Tragheim Church. The street ran from Junkerstra√üe to Wrangelstra√üe, parallel to Steindamm. Mitteltragheim's main road, also called Mitteltragheim, ran from Burgstra√üe to Wallring. In 1897 the Baugewerkschule (building trades school) moved from Synagogenstra√üse in Vorstadt to Sch√∂nstra√üe in central Tragheim.M√ºhlpfordt, p. 10 From 1860 to 1872 theater director Arthur Woltersdorff's Wilhelmstheater was located in Mitteltragheim. Acquired by the government in 1872, it was converted into the Regierungs-Pr√§sidium, the administrative seat for Regierungsbezirk K√∂nigsberg, in 1880.Albinus, p. 255 By 1914 the Ostpreu√üische Zeitung, a conservative newspaper, was published from Tragheimer Pulverstra√üe in central Tragheim.Gause II, p. 619 Hintertragheim's eponymous main road ran from Theaterplatz to Wrangelstra√üe. Hintertragheim with its sidestreets was nicknamed the GeheimratsviertelAlbinus, p. 128 (privy council quarter) because of the many court officials who lived there. Numerous prominent professors also lived in Hintertragheim. K√∂nigsberg's Masonic Lodges were located in Hintertragheim near the Schlossteich and included Zum Todtenkopfe und Phoenix, the Dreikronenloge, and the Johannisloge Immanuel.Gause II, p. 588 A mathematical physics cabinet was located in the private residence of Franz Ernst Neumann in Hintertragheim.Albinus, p. 324 A Baptist chapel was constructed in Hintertragheim in 1870, while the Wilhelmsgymnasium moved from Altro√üg√§rter Predigerstra√üe in Rossgarten to Hintertragheim in 1879. The street Nachtigallensteig in northern Hintertragheim was named after the large numbers of nightingales which lived in the vicinity and frequented the Studentenflie√ü, a stream which flowed into the Oberteich. In 1698 Elector Frederick III imposed a fine of 100 Gulden for shooting or caging a nightingale. While the street was long known as Nachtigallensteig, the idyllic name was only made official in 1884.Albinus, p. 220 The University of K√∂nigsberg moved from its original campus in Kneiphof to Paradeplatz between Tragheim and Burgfreiheit in 1861. Several of the university's buildings were also located in Tragheim. The royal and university library moved to the Braxein-Tettau-Henschesches Palais in 1901. A physics institute and an agriculture academy were located in northwestern Tragheim. The Baugewerkschule was situated on Sch√∂nstra√üe. By the late 19th century, Wrangel-Stra√üe in northern Tragheim contained the Protestant cemetery of Tragheim Church, a Jewish cemetery, the cuirassier barracks, and horse stables. The Bismarck- Oberlyzeum moved into the former barracks in 1931. Built in the early 20th century on the northern side of Wallring was the Haus der Technik, the Christuskirche, and the Kunsthalle, while the Hindenburg-Oberrealschule was on the southern side. The Ostmesse trade fair was located just north of Tragheim. In 1906 military engineers dismantled part of the city walls in northern Tragheim just south of the Wrangel Tower (Wrangelturm, named after Friedrich Graf von Wrangel) near the Oberteich. In order to comply with Jewish law, the city's Adass Isroel congregation requested the installation of an eruv to enclose the community. A wire known as the Judendraht was thus installed over the gap in the wall, symbolically completing the eruv.Albinus, p. 142 Notes References  *Karl, G. (1924).
