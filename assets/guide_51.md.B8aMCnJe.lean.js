Bagshys have enjoyed great respect in Turkmen society as guardians of the culture, and since independence in 1991, they have received greater support from the government.Historical Dictionary of Turkmenistan by Rafis Abazov In central Asia, the word bagshy (also spelt as baqshi or bakshi among other variants) refers to a bard or a shaman. The model Turkic bard is the legendary figure of Dede Korkut (or Qorqyt), who is also regarded as the saint and protector of all bagshy. Dede Korkut is the central figure in the epic The Book of Dede Korkut. He is also said to be the inventor of the two-stringed fiddle known as the qobyz, which is the preferred instrument of shamans. The art of the bagshy is called the bagshychylyk in Turkmen and is handed down orally from one generation of bagshy to the next. The master (halypa) teaches the student (shagirt). Aspiring bagshys pay homage to patron figures such as Ashyk Aydyn Pir and Baba Gambar. The former's shrine is located in Dashoguz province in northern Turkmenistan.

The Negro boarding school attracted students from all of the surrounding rural areas including towns now known as Biscoe, Mount Gilead, Candor, Pekin, Star, in addition to Troy, NC. Peabody Academy was the only institution that served the educational needs of African Americans. History =Douglas Hall= thumb In 1913 under the leadership of Principal and Reverend Sims, a successful fundraising campaign would help collect approximately $6,000 for the erection of a brick building to serve as the main building of Peabody Academy. The building would be called Douglas Hall. These funds would also be dedicated to constructing a new boy‚Äôs dormitory to be named Anderson Hall. However, WWI would put a halt to Rev Sim‚Äôs ambitious plan. By 1920, Douglas Hall was near completion and a magnificent structure it was. Peabody students, staff, and carpenters sent by the AMA joined together to construct the school‚Äôs main building. It was a cathedral-like building, composed of brick, with a wall of windows over 25-feet high surrounding the large front double doors. It was modern in every respect, including indoor plumbing and electric lighting. Classrooms were on the first and second floor. The main feature of the first floor was the beautiful chapel and auditorium. The basement housed the school cafeteria and science laboratories. Douglas Hall was destroyed by fire in 1946. The current standing Main Hall for Peabody Academy was built on the same foundation of Douglas Hall.  The American Missionary Association  The American Missionary Association (AMA) was a nondenominational abolitionist society dedicated to providing education and political rights to African Americans. The AMA was founded in Syracuse, New York, in 1846 through the merger of a group of abolitionists who supported the uprising of slaves on the Amistad in 1839 with several small missionary organizations. Though the AMA‚Äôs constitution stated that spreading the Christian gospel to America and other nations was the primary goal of the association, it quickly began to center its activities around anti-slavery missions. As slaves were freed during the Civil War, the AMA altered its mission to making provisions for them. More than 500 churches and schools were set up by the AMA to help acculturate the newly freed slaves. The (AMA) sent Reverend William Ellis to Troy, NC to build a Congregational church and school. After the death of Rev. Ellis, Reverend Orishatukeh Faduma, a native African and graduate of London University and Yale, led the school for 17 years starting in 1895. Rev. Faduma was a fine man of moral character and integrity, born in Sierra-Leon. Rev. Faduma graduated from Methodist High School, studied at Queens College in Taunton and London University. He received a Bachelor of Arts In 1885, the first man from Sierra- Leon to do so. He continued his education at Yale University Divinity School , receiving the Bachelor of Divinity in 1895. Peabody excelled academically under the leadership of Fuduma. The curriculum in those days included courses in the Theology, Masonry, Early Childhood Development, Finance & Economics, Mathematics, Science, and English.  Peabody Community Development, Inc  Alumni and former students of Peabody High School formed and incorporated an organization to encourage alumni to participate actively in the Troy community and Montgomery County alike. It also promotes its members to attend events, to volunteer, to create new ways for alumni to stay connected to each other, and to contribute to the greatness of North Carolina. Members meet once a month at the Peabody Museum inside of the Troy Housing Authority. The organization approved a partnership with the Peabody Legacy Project to preserve and highlight the legacy of Peabody Academy, Peabody High School, and Peabody Alumni. The project's secondary mission is to establish a digital footprint for the Peabody Academy/High School through a docuseries, interviews, online postings, videos, and use of social media.

He produced magnificent Baroque frescos and hunting still lifes.Izaak Godijn at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He is credited with introducing the Baroque Netherlandish tradition of hunting pieces into Bohemia.G√©rard de Wallens (with R. Treydel), Godyn (Izaak, 1660-1712), in: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, volume 56, Leipzig, 2007, p. 466 Life Details about his life are scarce. Izaak Godijn was probably born around 1660 in Antwerp. He is believed to be the younger brother of the painter Abraham Godijn or Abraham Godyn who studied under the prominent history painter Hendrik Herregouts. It is not clear with whom Izaak studied but it is assumed he trained initially in Antwerp. Still life with poultry, vegetables and fruit He travelled likely in the company of Abraham Godijn to Italy. He moved in 1690 to Prague where he joined Abraham Godijn. Here he worked as a court painter. He worked together with Abraham Goddijn on a commission to paint frescos in the Troja Palace in Prague. They were part of a group of artists who worked from 1687 to 1693 for Count Wenzel Adalbert von Sternberg on the decoration of the Troja Palace in Prague. This group included Flemish artists such as Johann Baptiste Bouttats.Jan Baptist Bouttats at the Netherlands Institute for Art History After Abraham Godijn returned to Antwerp, Izaak was in Prague employed as a court painter to Count Wenzel Adalbert von Sternberg from 1693 to 1712. In 1700 he married in Prague. From 1703 onwards he attempted to become a member of the painter's guild of Mal√° Strana in Prague but was not successful. A statement by Count von Sternberg that Godijn was his court painter was likely the reason for this failure. Izaak was still documented in Prague in 1708. The date and place of his death are not known but it is presumed he died in Prague after 1712. Work Janus temple, Troja Palace fresco Izaak Godijn collaborated with Abraham Godijn on the frescos which Count von Sternberg commissioned to be painted in the main room of the Troja Castle. The paintings are considered to be among the best examples of Baroque fresco painting in Northern Europe. The frescos use illusionist effects and narrate in a triumphalist way the history of the Habsburg Dynasty. The design follows the Baroque schema of architectural symbolism whereby the ceiling depicts the celestial world and the walls the terrestrial world. The ceiling is decorated with celestial beings that were said to protect the Habsburg territories. Underneath the curved surfaces below the ceiling, angels and putti are floating before trompe-l'≈ìil architecture showing scenes from Habsburg history. The walls depict the terrestrial world with one of the scenes on the shorter walls celebrating the victory of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor over the Turks. In one scene we see the trompe-l'≈ìil effect of a Turk falling down with his arms outstretched while his shadow is reflected on the painting (see illustration). The longer wall holds statues or busts of the Habsburg rulers in grisaille.Wiener Jahrbuch f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, B√∂hlau Verlag Wien, 1996, p. 114 The fresco programme achieved a sophisticated and complex synthesis of fictionalist painting of architecture and lively figural scenes.Mojm√≠r Horyna, Pavel Zahradn√≠k, Pavel Preiss, Czernin Palace in Prague, Opus, 2001, p. 149 The exact contribution of Izaak to this decorative program has yet to be clarified. Hunting still life with deer As Izaak's participation in the paintings in the castle of Troja is not documented, he is now mainly recognised for his introduction of the hunting still life into Bohemia. It is possible that Abraham Goddijn also played a role in this introduction of the Netherlandish type of hunting trophy images. Izaak is known to have painted many images of hunting trophies for the noble families von Sternberg, Czernin and Kolowrat. Representative of his work in this genre is the extensive collection in the Kolowrat Gallery (Rychnov nad Knƒõ≈ænou Castle). His hunting pieces drew inspiration from the works of Frans Snyders in their sumptuousness and decorative aspect and from those of Jacobus Victors and Melchior de Hondecoeter in their overall conception and use of the landscape. In the Flemish tradition he created a dramatic effect in his hunting pieces. He continued the late Baroque's use of dramatic composition and lighting. In his compositions he placed the brightly illuminated prey in front of a gloomy landscape or a dark kitchen interior.

Clinical features  Due to the variable bleeding phenotype of this disorder, the clinical picture ranges from life-threatening and traumatic bleeds to mild or no bleeding tendency. In some cases, it is first noted after a surgical procedure, however, most occur spontaneously without apparent provocation. As patients with AHA are often elderly, co- morbidities and co-medications such as anti-platelet agents may also influence the clinical profile and require an individualized therapeutic approach. Symptomatic patients often present with large hematomas, extensive ecchymosis or severe mucosal bleeding, including epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and haematuria.

Diagnosis  Any acute or recent onset of bleeding symptoms in a patient with no previous history of bleeding, especially in elderly or post-partum patients, and an unexplained isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) suggest the diagnosis of AHA, and need further investigation. The differential diagnosis in prolonged aPPT with a normal prothrombin time (PT) includes factor deficiencies, lupus anticoagulant or heparin therapy.Collins P, Baudo F, Huth-K√ºhne A, Ingerslev J, Kessler CM, Mingot Castellano ME, et al. Consensus recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of acquired hemophilia A. BMC Research Notes. 2010; 3: 161-8.

Proceedings: A more uniform measurement of factor VIII inhibitors. Thromb Diath Haemorrh. 1975; 34: 612 in which patient plasma and normal plasma are mixed and aPTT measured; correction of prolonged aPTT suggests a factor deficiency while persistent prolongation indicates the presence of an inhibitor. Prolongation of the aPTT in a mixture of patient and normal plasma after a 1-2 h incubation compared to an immediate mix is typical of FVIII autoantibodies, as FVIII inhibitors are time and temperature- dependent. The diagnosis is confirmed by the subsequent identification of reduced FVIII levels with evidence of FVIII neutralising activity (titrated using the Bethesda assay or the Nijmegen modification).Verbruggen B, Novakova I, Wessels H, Boezeman J, van den Berg M, Mauser-Bunschoten E. The Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay for factor VIII:C inhibitors: improved specificity and reliability. Thromb Haemost. 1995; 73: 247-51.  Treatment  Patients with acquired coagulation factor inhibitors should be treated jointly with haemophilia centres experienced in the management of inhibitors. Initial treatment consists of four steps:W Collins, P. , Chalmers, E. , Hart, D. , Jennings, I. , Liesner, R. , Rangarajan, S. , Talks, K. , Williams, M. and R. M. Hay, C.

First-line treatment includes by-pass agents (activated prothrombin complex concentrates [aPCC] Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity [FEIBA] and recombinant activated factor VII rFVIIa]). Both treatments are effective and there is no evidence for the use of one product in preference to the other. Therapy should be continued until bleeding is controlled and management must generally rely on the clinical assessment as there are no validated laboratory tests to determine therapeutic levels. The main concern about the use of these agents is the appearance of thrombotic events.Aledort LM. Comparative thrombotic event incidence after infusion of recombinant factor VIIa versus factor VIII inhibitor bypass activity. J Thromb Haemost 2004; 2:1700-1708. Tranexamic acid is a useful adjunct therapy but concerns about its concomitant use with FEIBA exist. A recombinant porcine FVIII molecule has recently been approved to treat bleeding episodes, with similar pharmacokinetics to human FVIII and the possibility of laboratory measurement and dose-adjustment.Kruse-Jarres R, St- Louis J, Greist A, et al. Efficacy and safety of OBI-1, an antihaemophilic factor VIII (recombinant), porcine sequence, in subjects with acquired haemophilia A. Haemophilia 2015; 21:162. Alternative treatments if first-line treatment is unavailable or fails include human FVIII, DDAVP, intravenous immunoglobulin, immunoadsorption and plasmapheresis.  Antibody eradication  All patients diagnosed with AHA should receive immunosuppressive therapy immediately following diagnosis with prednisolone either alone or combined with cyclophosphamide, what has a complete remission rate of 70-80%. If there is no response within 3‚Äì5 weeks, second-line therapies should be considered. The most common second-line treatment is with rituximab combined with other agents. Alternative options are calcineurin inhibitors, multiple immunosuppressive agents and immune tolerance protocols. Most immunosuppressive drugs are associated with side effects, including neutropenia-related infections and sepsis. The relapse rate after a first complete remission has been estimated at about 20%Collins PW, Hirsch S, Baglin TP,Dolan G, Hanley J, Makris M, et al.Acquired hemophilia A in the United Kingdom: a 2-year national surveillance study by the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors‚Äô Organisation.

Jashar Pasha was of the Gjinolli family, a powerful medieval Albanian family who contributed to the cultural and religious development amongst Albanians. Gjinolli was also tied to the Bushati family in 1812 when Mustafa Pasha Bushati married Ibrahim Pashas daughter with Jashar Pasha who had two sons: Bahtijar and Andurrahman Pasha. After the reformations of Mahmud II, Jashar Pasha participated in the battles against Reshid Mehmed Pasha and later against the Grada≈°ƒçeviƒá. For these battles, he was given the rank of mytesarrif of Skopje. In Prishtina, Bahtijar died and his father raised a mosque in his name in 1834. It is believed that Jashar Pasha Gjinolli's origin was from a Bahtijar Beu, son of Hysrev Gjin Zadeoglu, son of Gjin Zada, belonging to an Albanian medieval feudal family. Jashar Pasha's grandfather Bahtijar was most likely related to Gjon Gjini, a tribal chieftain near Novob√´rd√´. In 1837, Jashar Pasha attacked the Drenica region and became quickly unpopular as he waged war against Albanian anti-reformist pashaliks and he allowed Serb enclaves in Pristina, which was against Albanian nationalist interests. Jashar Pasha Gjinolli is reported by both Albanian and Serb historians as a cruel and sadistic ruler who demolished churches, imprisoned both Catholics and Orthodox believers alike and killed nuns. He also arrested, imprisoned and killed Albanian pashaliks who sought independence from the Ottoman Empire.  Death  Jashar Pasha's death is disputed amongst historians. According to H.

The Continental name was chosen over Central States Basketball League so that it would be more inviting to potential teams outside of Illinois and Wisconsin, where the football league was based. The CBA played using National Basketball Association rules, which included a 24-second shot clock. Each team played a 20-game schedule, divided into 10 home games and 10 away.

As the 12th Duke died childless, the dukedom became vacant for 2 years until it was rehabilitated in 1884 by Alfonso XII in favour of the 12th Duke's niece, Mar√≠a Cristina Fernanda Brunetti y Gayoso de los Cobos, 18th Countess of Belalc√°zar and sister of the Duke of Arcos. The name of the title makes reference to the Sardinian municipality of Mandas, and most likely to the nearby town of Villanova (Villanueva), both belonging to the province of South Sardinia. Although the second part of the denomination also seems to allude to one of the first holder's maternal surnames, it also might borrow it from the eponymous town in Benag√©ber, which was the manor of the Ladr√≥n de Pall√°s family, Lords of Benag√©ber and Counts of Sinarcas.

The UN hopes that this would lead to negotiations which would subsequently lead to a peaceful end of the Syrian Civil War, which had been raging for more than eight years by the time of the committee's formation. The Constitutional Committee was formed with the formal approval of both parties involved‚Äînamely the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and the opposition Syrian Negotiations Commission, with the facilitation of the United Nations. It is described by UN General Secretary Ant√≥nio Guterres as part of a \\"Syrian-owned and Syrian-led\\" peace process. The decisions it takes are not binding under Syrian law and the committee relies on the good faith of both parties for their implementation. The committee is also not bound by any deadlines or timetables.  Origins  The proposal for the creation of a committee to amend Syria's constitution can be traced back to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, which was adopted in December 2015. The resolution provided a framework for the creation of such a committee, but its implementation was delayed until after the Geneva peace talks on Syria and then later delayed until a rough framework agreement was reached in Russia in January 2018.UN's Guterres announces Syria constitutional committee formation . \\"Announcement came a week after UN chief said an agreement was reached concerning 'composition of the committee'.\\" 23 Sept 2019. Al Jazeera. The formation of the committee was delayed numerous times, as both sides strongly disagreed on its composition and as the armed conflict continued throughout the negotiations. By the time the committee's composition was agreed upon, the Syrian Government had managed to gain control of the majority of the country's territory through military means. But millions of Syrians have been forcibly displaced, with about half of Syria's pre-war population living outside of the country. Even as the committee's membership list neared its final draft, arguments emerged over which members should be picked to 'represent civil society' ‚Äì as both the Syrian Government and Opposition attempted to influence the selection of the figures from the UN's list. The Constitutional Committee, including a package agreement on the Terms of Reference and Core Rules of Procedure of,https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/note- correspondents/2019-09-28/note-correspondents-press-release-the-office-of-the- united-nations-special-envoy-for-syria-geir-o-pedersen and nominees to the Constitutional Committee was finalized to on 23 September 2019 after a meeting between UN envoy Geir Pedersen and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, and after consultations with the opposition. The Constitutional Committee was convened by and is facilitated by the UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Otto Pedersen, a Norwegian diplomat, who noted that the committee was the \\"first concrete political agreement between the Government and the Opposition to begin to implement a key aspect of Security Council resolution 2254 ‚Äì to set a schedule and process for a new constitution.\\" https://dppa.un.org/en/security- council-briefing-situation-syria-special-envoy-geir-o-pedersen  History of committee process  = Inaugural meeting = The large body of the committee met for the first time on 30 October 2019, at 12:00 local time at the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Co-Chair nominated by the Syrian Government, Ahmad Kuzbari, lamented \\"terrorism\\" and hailed the \\"sacrifices and heroic deeds\\" of the Syrian Army during his inaugural speech. The opposition- nominated Co-Chair, Hadi al-Bahra, stated that it was time for them to \\"believe [that] victory in Syria is achieving justice and peace not winning the war\\". The two co-chairs did not shake hands at the end of the 45-minute opening ceremony. The first meeting of the 45-member small body took place on 4 November and lasted for four hours. The body decided to hold subsequent 4-hour sessions daily for two weeks. The meeting was described as \\"positive\\" and \\"successful\\". = First session and initial proposals = In its first days, the Committee managed to agree on a \\"code of conduct\\" for its members ‚Äì which bound them to work with a \\"spirit of respect, cooperation and good faith\\", avoid any actions which might harm other members, as well as refrain from distributing any documents from within the plenary room as \\"official papers\\". The code of conduct, however, was made between the two Co-Chairs representing the Syrian Government and Opposition respectively, and not voted on by the whole body of the committee. The Syrian Opposition focused its efforts on a return to an amended version of Syria's 1950 constitutional charter, which would considerably limit the powers of the Syrian Presidency, instead empowering a prime ministerial post. These efforts were rebuked by the Syrian Government, which flatly denied the proposal. Proposals given before the committee included the recognition of the Kurdish language as a secondary language, as well as dropping the word \\"Arab\\" from Syria's official name ‚Äì the \\"Syrian Arab Republic\\". Proposals aimed at bolstering the role of Kurds in Syria were strongly opposed by Turkey, which was expected to influence the opposition's delegates into voting down any proposal it deemed out of line. = Second session and deadlock = The second session of the Committee ended in late November 2019 without agreement, as the two sides did not meet each other after failing to agree on an agenda for the session. The Syrian government delegation had presented an agenda of what it dubbed \\"national pillars of the Syrian people\\", which rejected foreign, especially Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War, called for the lifting on the sanctions against Syria and condemned the armed rebel groups in Syria as terrorists. The opposition delegation rejected this proposal and accused the government delegation of attempting to sabotage the committee's work. The opposition's delegation instead presented five proposals, mostly aimed at changing the preamble and principles of Syria's constitution. The government delegation rejected these proposals, stating that they would refuse to accept constitutional proposals before the committee accepts a statement of values, which it opines ought to condemn foreign involvement. The government delegation then presented a proposal that suggested a meeting of the full committee and a discussion of the proposals presented by each member. This was also rejected by the opposition's delegation, with the opposition co-chair Hadi Al Bahra stating that they were \\"not in a cultural forum to have dialogue and discussions while explosive barrels are falling\\". The Syrian opposition blamed the failure to agree to an agenda on the Syrian government for introducing what they deemed were \\"irrelevant\\" proposals to the committee, while the government delegation blamed the opposition for refusing to enter the meeting room. Following these developments, the meeting was called off. UN Envoy Geir Otto Pedersen stated that no date had been set for a future meeting of the committee. The Northwestern Syria offensive (November 2019‚Äìpresent) between the government and opposition forces began in parallel to the breakdown of talks at the constitutional committee. A month later, in December 2019, Pedersen spoke before the UN Security Council, describing the situation as \\"protracted\\" and \\"deadlocked\\" and urged the two sides to agree to an agenda, stating that without such there would be no reason for the committee to meet for a third time. The oppositon HNC's Chairman, Naser al-Hariri, stated in an interview to Asharq Al-Awsat in later December that the opposition would not enter into any talks with the government delegation before an agenda is set. He accused the Syrian government of failing the negotiations by not agreeing to their proposed agenda. =August 2020 session= A third session of negotiations, among the 45-member small body, with 15 members from the government, opposition, and civil society, respectively, started in late August 2020, with a break of several days due to some members testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Pedersen stated that he had \\"received a 'strong signal of support' from 'key international players' and from \\"all sides in the Constitutional Committee\\" for the continuation of the peace process. Anadolu Agency interpreted the \\"international players\\" to refer to Iran, Russia, Turkey and the US. Hadi al-Bahra, one of the opposition leaders, and Ahmad Kuzbari, on behalf of the Syrian government, were co-chairs of the session.  Composition  = Large body = The whole committee itself, referred to as the large body and sometimes also dubbed the expanded body, is composed of three groups of 50 members each, where the first group is directly nominated by Bashar al-Assad's government. The second is directly nominated by the Syrian Opposition's High Negotiations Committee and the third includes figures of Syrian civil society, selected by the United Nations. Nearly 30% of all members of the committee are women and seven members are Syrian Kurds. The committee's delegates included members of the People's Council of Syria, university rectors and journalists. Both the Syrian government and opposition intentionally avoided nominating senior political figures as representatives, so as to prevent previous conflicts from hampering the committee's work. The committee is headed by two equal co-chairs ‚Äì one nominated by the Syrian Government and the other by the Syrian opposition. They are aided by Geir Pedersen, a UN official who succeeded Staffan De Mistura, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Kofi Annan, as the envoy of the UN's political efforts in Syria.  Government quota  Ahmad al-Kuzbari, a member of the Syrian People's Council, was selected by the Syrian Government as the Co-Chair of the Committee. Al-Kuzbari remarked that he hoped that the next session of the committee would be held not in Geneva, but in Damascus. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stated before state media that his government was not a direct part of the Committee, but that the government delegation represented its view. The highest-ranked government official in the delegation was Ahmed Faruk Arnus, an aide to Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem. No other senior government officials were included in the delegation. The delegation itself, which refers to itself as the \\"government-backed delegation\\", is focused around issues surrounding support for Syria's national sovereignty, as well as its state and military institutions. The delegation is also opposed to Western-backed sanctions against the nation.  UN quota  The UN quota was reportedly picked from members from diverse religious, ethnic and geographical backgrounds, with nearly half of its members being women. The members nominated to fill this quota were selected by UN envoy for the Syrian conflict Geir Pedersen.  Opposition quota  The opposition quota, formally appointed by the High Negotiations Committee is reportedly split into different factions. Turkey was found to have the most influence over the opposition's delegation, playing a role in the selection of over 20 of the opposition's 50 total representatives. Seventeen of those 20 allegedly influenced by Ankara lived in Turkey at the time of the inauguration of the Committee. Some of the opposition representatives are members of the Turkish- backed Free Syrian Army. Russia had the second largest degree of influence over the opposition's delegation ‚Äì with 7 of the 50 opposition delegates having links to Moscow. Of those seven, 5 are members of the \\"Moscow Platform\\", which unlike almost all other opposition factions, does not demand the end of Bashar al-Assad's term as President of Syria. Five members of the opposition delegation are closely aligned to the \\"Cairo platform\\" made up by secularist individuals of various ideologies, influenced by Egypt ‚Äì a country with close links to the Syrian Government. Six are members of the National Coordination Committee ‚Äì a coalition of secular left-wing parties representing Syria's non-violent \\"internal\\" opposition and often described as Syria's \\"most moderate opposition group\\". The NCC is tolerated by the Syrian Government and operates openly within Syria, but is sometimes accused of being a front organization for the Syrian Government by several armed opposition groups, which the non-violent NCC has refused to endorse. The main leaders of the opposition's delegations, such as Ahmad Tu'mah and designated Committee Co- Chair Hadi al-Bahra, rejected affiliations to any group and instead defined themselves as \\"pragmatists\\" ‚Äì seeing the \\"Russian-dominated\\" peace process as the only path left for the Syrian Opposition, seeking to eke out political concessions as the prospect of a government overthrow grew far away. The two represented the highest-ranking opposition members in the delegation, with other senior opposition representatives that had previously headed talks, such as Ahmad Jarba, Naser al-Hariri and Riyad Hijab, being absent from the opposition's delegation. = Small body = The small body, also sometimes described as the mini-committee, is a cut-down version of the large body, analogous to a parliamentary committee, with 15 members from each of the large body's groups.  Committee structure  = Legislative procedure = All proposals must first be introduced in the small body of the committee. If a draft proposal is accepted by the small body, it is then passed on for voting in the large body. A proposal is only considered adopted if it is accepted by both bodies. Any decision of both the large or small body may only pass if it has the support of a supermajority consisting of 75% of the respective body's members. The committee is, however, instructed to make decisions by consensus where possible. If the committee manages to draft a full new Syrian constitution, it would then be put to a UN-monitored referendum for approval by the Syrian people. The Constitutional Committee has no formal legal status within Syria. The decisions taken by it are not binding in Syrian law, as the formation of the Committee is not in line with the process of constitutional amendment set out by the current Constitution of Syria. Furthermore, the Committee also lacks a legal mandate over the Syrian Opposition. Owing to these facts, it remains to be seen whether either party will actually respect the decisions of the committee. = Disputes = The High Negotiations Committee is the only group selected to represent the Syrian opposition, leaving many other anti-government groups in Syria completely unrepresented in the committee. Despite the inclusion of seven total ethnic Kurds in the committee, the mostly neutral Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, as well as its majority-Kurdish military wing ‚Äì the Syrian Democratic Forces, is also left completely unrepresented. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Al- Qaeda-linked group designated by the UN as a terrorist organization, as well as Syria's largest rebel group, was excluded from the negotiations for the formation of the committee from its inception. The object of the committee's work is also called into question by both sides. The Syrian Government's delegation asserts that the committee's work should be focused on amending the current Syrian Constitution, which was adopted in 2012, while the opposition delegates insist on creating an entirely new constitution.  Analysis of committee processes  The launch of the committee was met with skepticism by political analysts, who noted both the lack of good faith between the Syrian Government and Opposition, as well as the government's recent territorial gains as factors that might prevent the committee from fulfilling its stated objective. Some analysts further criticised the 75% supermajority rule, which they described as a \\"recipe for paralysis\\". Some experts noted that the committee is unlikely to lead to peace, as large groups, such as Rojava are excluded from the peace process, while parts of the Syrian Opposition itself have condemned it entirely. They also noted that the committee faces criticism for the non-elected nature of its members and also that the committee itself might be \\"unconstitutional\\", as it falls outside the rules set out by the current Constitution of Syria for constitutional amendments, which renders its decisions legally non-binding in Syria. Analysts mostly agree that the lack of a binding timetable, the recent military defeats suffered by the opposition, as well as the divisions within the opposition delegation itself give the upper hand to the Syrian Government and its delegation. According to Sami Moubayed writing in The Arab Weekly, should the drafting process continue into 2021, any term limits imposed by a new or amended constitution on the Presidency would only take effect as of 2028 ‚Äì after the President has completed his full seven-year term.  Reactions  = International organization = * ‚Äì The UN described the launch of the committee as a \\"sign of hope\\" for ending the Syrian Civil War. = National = * ‚Äì Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the Syrian Government was \\"committed to a political process to end the more than eight-year crisis\\". Syrian state broadcaster SANA described the foreign minister's meeting with UN authorities as \\"constructive and positive\\". Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to accept any decision reached by the Constitutional Committee, so long as that decision was \\"in line with our [Syria's] national interest\\". He added that the committee had \\"nothing to do\\" with the upcoming Elections in Syria, which he stated would still be held under the auspices of the Syrian state. * ‚Äì Russia supported the formation of the committee, dubbing its launch as a \\"victory\\". * ‚Äì Iran voiced its support for the agreement, with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif stating that he had always thought that the end of the Syrian Conflict would come through a political solution and added that the committee would have Iran's full support. * ‚Äì Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu supported the agreement, stating that Turkey \\"emphasized the importance of the need to deal with humanitarian issues throughout the whole [Syrian] territory\\". * ‚Äì The French Foreign Ministry expressed its support for what it deemed to be the \\"relaunch of political regulation in Syria under the auspices of the UN\\". *On 2 November, the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States issued a joint statement in which they praised the efforts of UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres and UN Syria Envor Geir Pedersen for the establishment of the committee, which they dubbed a \\"positive step\\". = Syrian Opposition = * ‚Äì The High Negotiations Committee's spokesman described the committee as a \\"logical thing\\", which would create a \\"secure environment\\" for the drafting of a new constitution. He further dubbed it \\"a critical turning point\\" in the achievement of a political solution. The Syrian Network for Human Rights condemned the formation of the committee, stating that they believed it \\"violated and contravened international law\\". Syrian dissident Anwar al-Bunni condemned the committee, dubbing it as a \\"pretext to fulfill a military agenda on the ground\\". Various opposition groups criticised the opposition's representatives to the council on social media, dubbing them \\"unrepresentative\\" or \\"unqualified\\", while others dismissed the committee entirely, calling it a \\"futile endeavor\\", which would only \\"buy time\\" for the Syrian Government to start a new military offensive against the opposition. The Suqour al-Sham Brigades and the remnants of the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement both condemned the formation of the committee and stated that they will boycott its decisions. = Other non-state groups = * ‚Äì Rojava officials condemned the fact that they were excluded from the peace talks and stated that \\"having a couple of Kurds\\" in the committee did not mean that the Syrian Kurds were properly represented in it. The co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council accused Turkey of vetoing the representation of Syrian Kurds within the committee. The Kurdish administration also organized demonstrations in front of the UN office in Qamishli to protest their exclusion from the committee.

It is a brick building, with the brick being load-bearing, and is stucco-faced, and has \\"Spanish Mission\\" style. It was built by contractor John D.C. McKinnon. The 1903 section, fronting on Main Street, is in plan, and has two one-story storefronts and a two-story pavilion containing them plus a central hallway leading to the hotel lobby. The 1928 section is a three-story, U-shaped portion facing Railroad Street and the train depot. The original section was altered somewhat in the 1928 renovation. It has a \\"raised, stepped, curvilinear parapet with cement coping painted a rich brown\\" hiding its flat roof. The building was deemed significant \\"as one of the most elaborate buildings in Coffee County. Constructed by Japenth Rawls about 1903 and remodeled and enlarged by his nephew, Jesse P. Rawls, in [1928], it is located across from the train station (NRHP 8-7-74) and has served as a landmark and central meeting place for the citizens of Enterprise. The building is also significant for its associations with the Rawls -- a family which was important in the early growth and prosperity of the city. The elder Rawls was involved in the development of the turpentine industry in Coffee County, while his nephew built and financed the first electric system in Enterprise and operated one of the largest and oldest mills in the city. It was, however, the railroad, whose station the hotel served, that gave the town its major economic stimulus.\\" With References Category:National Register of Historic Places in Coffee County, Alabama Category:Mission Revival architecture in Alabama Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1903 ","title":"Rawls Hotel"},{"id":"62199816","title":"Virginia State Route 707"},{"id":"62199819","title":"Virginia State Route 708"},{"id":"62199823","title":"International Federation of Variety Artists"},{"id":"62199827","title":"Virginia State Route 710"},{"id":"62199830","title":"2019 Slovak Open"},{"id":"62199835","title":"Virginia State Route 712"},{"id":"62199836","text":"Lisinopril/amlodipine, sold under the brand name Lisonorm among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure.

Critical analysis  This installation, one of the first ones of the Art & Language collective, replaces the surface of a painting with mirrors. It allows us to discuss, among other things, the theme of representation as well as the place and role of the spectator in the work of art. The mirror, being a surface that reflects light without its own image, the artists will say of this gesture: The mirror being in the place of what should be a painting, the spectator sees himself looking at a work of art and the recent practice of selfies has greatly contributed to the popularity of this Mirror Piece.

These officers were principally from south-east English forces such as the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police and frequently suffered from lung diseases, for which sea air was held to be beneficial. It opened in March 1890 at 51 Clarendon Villas, which for a time also housed the Southern Counties Police Orphanage A site was soon found at 11 Portland Road for a purpose-built redbrick replacement building with an infirmary and surgery. The Home was largely funded by the Metropolitan and City Police Convalescent Home Fund, some of whose records between 1902 and 1917 are held in the National Archives as MEPO 2/1723 The new building was designed by local architect John George Gibbens, with the foundation stone laid on 29 October 1892 by Princess Christian and opened by the wife of the 4th Earl of Chichester on 21 July the following year. The building was turned into an auxiliary hospital in 1895 during a flu epidemic and into an Auxiliary Military Hospital from 1914 to 1919. It then returned to its original use until 1966, when it moved to a site at 205 Kingsway, though the building at 11 Portland Road is now a privately owned nursing home.

The protests were initially triggered by a government proposal to limit nitrogen emissions in The Netherlands by halving the country's livestock, but protesting farmers have frequently told media that they are motivated by a perceived lack of respect for their profession by the Dutch populace, media and politicians. The protests combine several action groups and an amalgamation of larger goals, which include less government regulation for farmers, more air time for pro-farmer sentiments, and more policy to punish Shell and Tata Steel for their part in the emission crisis. The farmers protests were initially popular and supported by a majority of the Dutch population, but support declined significantly in December. Background The Netherlands has a strong agrarian and livestock sector, which produces significant agricultural exports. Since the mid-2000s, climate activism and animal rights activism have become more commonplace in the Dutch House of Representatives and general political discourse of The Netherlands, especially with the emergence of the Party for the Animals as a political force. Policy proposals by parties such as the Dutch green party, GroenLinks, and the center-left D66 have since emphasized the need for farmers to transition into sustainable farming. These policy proposals were consistently met with opposition by farmers and their representatives. By 2019, The Netherlands entered a nitrogen emission crisis as the RIVM reported that the severely damaging effects of nitrogen on Dutch soil could only be halted by direct action. The institute found that farmers were responsible for 46% of the countries' nitrogen emission, mostly due to cow dung produced by the livestock industry. This led Tjeerd de Groot, a member of the House of Representatives for D66, to propose new policy to halve the current Dutch livestock on September 9, 2019. The RIVM's findings coupled with De Groot's policy proposal led to resistance by Farmers Defense Force, a farmer activist group. It claimed that the institute had used ‚Äúshady methods‚Äù to ‚Äùportray‚Äù farmers as big time polluters. They claimed that their unfair portrayal as polluters is caused by the governments want to let the real big time polluters go free. They claimed their fundamental rights were threatened by legislation aiming to lower emissions and demanded that any new legislation would not threaten agricultural undertakings with elimination. They also demanded more research to be undertaken before new legislation be proposed. The government repudiated the accusations of using ‚Äúshady methods‚Äù being used by the RIVM and claimed the numbers were correct. In addition to the nitrogen emission crisis, Dutch news media have reported that farmers have felt disrespected or threatened in their existence because of increased government regulation on the agricultural and livestock sectors, as well as the popularity of animal rights activism among the Dutch population. An incident that occurred on May 13, 2019, in which up to 200 animal rights activists occupied a pig farm in Boxtel, Noord-Brabant, sowed fear among livestock farmers and motivated them to organize into collectives such as the Farmers Defense Force and Agractie, which later became key players in the farmers' protests.  Protests  = 1 October 2019 = 1 October was one of the days with most intense protests. Thousands of farmers went to The Hague to protest, their tractors causing over a thousand kilometres of traffic jams. This made it the busiest morning rush (hour) in the history of the Netherlands. When arriving at designated location, the Malieveld, the protesters damaged the area, driving through fences and signs and destroying the landscape. Afterwards farmers offered to assist in repairing the damage. In a speech sheep farmer Bart Kemp said that politicians lack the intelligence of farmers and claimed that the protests were the biggest ever undertaken by farmers in all of history. Minister Carola Schouten promises in a speech that as longs as she is minister of agriculture the amount of legally allowed livestock, a measure which parties like Democrats 66 supported in order to shrink nitrogen emissions. When proponents of the nitrogen measures got to tell their side of the story the farmers turned their backs to the stage and drowned out their arguments with curse words. The farmers again used unlawful action, stealing a microphone to prevent the proponents from talking making necessary an intervention security personnel. = 11 October 2019 = Farmers protest against the new nitrogen emission legislation in the provinces of Frisia and Brabant. As a result, the Frisian province revoked the law. = 14 October 2019 = At 12:00 employers‚Äô organisation LTO noord's protest-action began, having called on its 14.000 members to begin protesting in Gelderland, Overijssel, Drenthe, Groningen, North-Holland, South-Holland, Flevolandand Utrecht. In Groningen the farmers stormed the provincial government building. This was condemned by LTO Noord. = 15 October 2019 = Farmers from Limburg protest in front of the provincial government headquarters in Maastricht. In Zeeland farmers begin negotiating instead of holding protests. = 16 October 2019 = Protests on 16 October, which were organised by the Farmers Defence Force, started at the RIVM building in Bilthoven, later moving to the Binnenhof in The Hague as we last the central train station of that city. It were some of the most intense protest the farmers have undertaken so far. thumb During these protests a leader of the Farmers Defence Force threatened with civil war, claiming that the government using the military was ‚Äúa cowardly retreat behind a wall of intimidation and violence‚Äù. The soldiers were employed to block off roads in order to prevent escalation of the protests. This was a reaction to the violence the farmers employed in Groningen during previous protests. = 17 October 2019 = The seventeenth of October began with the farmers preparing a free breakfast for the inhabitants of The Hague before they hit the road again, using their tractors to dump used paper at government buildings. = 25 November 2019 = Farmers and builders parked next to the exits of major roads throughout the country, threatening to block the exits. One farmer declared ‚ÄúWe want to come out better‚Äù insinuating this meant ‚Äúbetter policy.‚Äù = December protests and blockings = The Farmers Defence Force planned to blocking food distribution throughout the country in the week before Christmas. FDF member Mark van den Oever stated that he wanted to refresh Dutch citizen's memory about the Dutch famine of 1944-45 in which thousands of citizens travelled to the countryside to ask local farmers for food due to shortages in the densely populated Western parts of the Netherlands. Next to that, Van den Oever stirred great controversy while comparing the situation of the Dutch farmers to that of the persecution of Jews the Second World War. These statements led to both support as well as anger. Out of 4955 farmers who filled in a survey by agricultural organisation LTO, 71% did not support potential blockings. 15% did not want any more protests at all. The potential blockings were quickly denounced as illegal.  13 December 2019  On 13 December, in a surprise protest, Farmers Defence Force blocked the roads to Eindhoven Airport for several hours, leading to severe traffic jams throughout the eastern part of Brabant. That same day, farmers also held protests in both Amsterdam and Den Bosch. Farmer Defence Force called the surprise protest in Eindhoven a teaser for the 18 December protests.  18 December 2019  On 17 December, a court case ruled that the farmers were not allowed to block the food distribution on their planned protest date on 18 December, but were allowed to protest at the locations. The farmers announced protests at 45 different locations, including the Mediapark in Hilversum. However, blockings still occurred after all. In Bergen op Zoom, farmers blocked a chemics company. Several border crossings between the Netherlands and Germany were blocked, sometimes in collaboration with German farmers. The protests led to several fines and several people were arrested by the police for throwing fireworks. \\"De boer dat is de keerl\\" Top 2000 voting campaign Team Agro, one of the collective farmer groups, announced their intention to vote Normaal's 1982 single \\"De boer dat is de keerl\\" to the top of the annual NPO Radio 2 marathon Top 2000. \\"De boer dat is de keerl\\" (Achterhooks for \\"The farmer, that is the man\\") is an adaption of a Fiddlin' John Carson American country song and tells the story of the hard-working and undervalued farmer who is deprived of his money. On 7 December, it was announced that \\"De boer dat is de keerl\\" was the ninth most voted song, and the top voted song in rural areas such as Twente, Weststellingwerf and Normaal's native Achterhoek region. = 5 February 2020 = The Farmers Defense Force announced a new protest, but canceled it in advance. Talks had been planned for the 5th of February, between the minister of agriculture Carola Schouten, prime minister Mark Rutte and the different protest groups. The reason the protest was canceled was allegedly because of new calculations of nitrogen emissions of the RIVM and the FDF wanting to wait for a better moment to organize a protest. = 19 February 2020 = The first protest in 2020 was on the 19th of February. Just like previous protests, this one was also organized by the Farmers Defense Force. However, the protest did not take place on the Malieveld in The Hague, because the city of The Hague and Staatsbosbeheer kindly asked them not to. The FDF reached out to the farmers and asked them to adhere to the rules. They protested on the Koekamp, a small park next to the Malieveld instead. The second difference is the usage of highways. The Dutch national police stated that they will enforce standard traffic rules. This resulted in a few farmers being pulled over and fined on different roads throughout the country for driving a tractor on motorways, despite the Farmers Defense Force stressing out farmers shouldn't make use of motor- or highways. Different political parties were invited to speech at the protest. The PVV of Geert Wilders, Forum voor Democratie and CDA were invited. Ultimately only FvD and CDA were allowed by the Farmers defense Force to speech on stage. Geert Wilders was rejected by the leaders of the FDF. FDF-member Jeroen van Maanen said on the stage that Wilders would only come if there were cameras or television crews and FDF would not allow that. After the protest ended around 3pm, a few farmers made their way to the Ministry for Agriculture. They were stopped by the police before they could reach the ministry building. The farmers carried stickers of the FDF, which they wanted to put on the building. = Future protests = The military has made available 25 trucks and 60 soldiers for the blocking of roads during the demonstrations planned to take place before the government's summer recess. On 12 July the Farmers went to protest in Maastricht.  Impact  In the aftermath of the most intense farmers protests the builders/construction workers, who were hit even harder by the new nitrogen legislation, as their companies can't run without new building while farms can run without new barns and animals, also took to the streets. Among them were protests on 30 October. Geert Wilders, Leader of the Party for Freedom, has proposed a 6-month contingency plan in which construction of housing, infrastructure and part of the agricultural sector are classed as projects vital for the country and are as such temporarily exempt from the new nitrogen legislation. A deal has been struck between the cabinet and the farmers collective. =Public opinion= In October, the farmers protests enjoyed broad popular support by the Dutch population, and farmers' demonstrations were facilitated by local officials, such as the mayor of The Hague. This drew some scrutiny especially in the aftermath of mass arrests at an Extinction Rebellion protest in Amsterdam in October. By December, the popular support for the farmers protests had declined. On December 13, 2019, a comment by Farmers Defense Force spokesperson Mark van den Oever comparing the treatment of farmers to the persecution of Jews during World War II was widely condemned. Threats to block food distribution centers led to further decline in popular support.

It has a partnership with Brewer Academy, which Braination operates but is owned by the San Antonio Independent School District (SAISD); and another with Karnes County Newcomers School, the latter serving people interned in the Karnes City, Texas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The Karnes contract is with GEO Group. The Karnes City facility serves family groups seeking asylum on an as-needed basis. The district previously operated a residential school at the Garza County Juvenile Detention Center in Post, Texas, but announced plans to close it in 2013 as the State of Texas at the time limited the number of schools that the district may operate to six, and Braination had plans to open the Anne Frank non- residential charter school in San Antonio. Therefore, the Post Independent School District became the new education provider for that detention facility. The state identification number of the former Post school was given to Frank.

It closed at a later point. =International Academy of San Antonio= International Academy of San Antonio is a private school, initially with elementary grades only, that opened in 2019. Braination decided to make it a private school instead of a charter school so that it can use the Common Ground Collaborative program without having a conflict with Texas standardized testing practices used in district public and charter schools. The preliminary enrollment for fall 2019 was around 100. Its facility was previously used by the Eleanor Kolitz Hebrew Language Academy, and is on the property of the San Antonio Jewish Community Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Campus. The first principal is Raul Hinojosa. Bruce Rockstroh, the CEO and superintendent of Braination, stated that the funds for this school are separate from the charter school finances. In 2019 the school planned to charge $12,000 per year per student.

History The federation was established in February 1975 at a conference in London, on the initiative of the Alan Sapper and the British Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians. It decided not to affiliate to either the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) or the World Federation of Trade Unions. As such, it brought together social democratic, communist and non-aligned trade unions from around the world. This put it in competition with the ICFTU-aligned International Secretariat of Entertainment Trade Unions (ISETU). By 1979, the federation had affiliates from Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, East Germany, Finland, France, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia. FISTAV worked closely with the International Federation of Actors and International Federation of Musicians, and the three were sometimes termed the \\"FFF\\" secretariats. In 1991, the three agreed to work more closely with ISETU, forming the \\"International Committee of Entertainment and Media Unions\\". In 1993, FISTAV merged with ISETU, to form what became known as the Media and Entertainment International. Sapper served as the federation's president throughout its existence, while its first general secretary was Ren√© Janelle, and its final general secretary was Annie Abramovicz.

Mythological background Married to a Cameron of Moy, Gormshuil, which means 'the blue-eyed noble one' in Gaelic, was known for her supernatural powers and fishermen and hunters would often seek her blessing. There are many stories about Gormshuil, often called Gormla, a name that was often used to describe a woman who was a witch. But the most quoted story about Gormshuil tells of the warning she gave to her Clan Chief, Ewen Cameron of Lochiel who was passing by with his piper on his way to talk to the Duke of Atholl about a border between Lochaber and Perthshire. At first he ignored Gormshuil but she told him to return home to get his men. He should take them with him and keep them hidden and if he needed them he was to turn his coat inside out. Lochiel took her advice and although Atholl too had men lying in wait, he was able to defeat them.. This dispute between Lochiel and Atholl led to the Cameron clan's motto 'Sons of the hounds, come here and get flesh.' It's also said that this came from the tune Lochiel's piper was playing at the time, 'Thigibh an seo, chlanna nan con, is gheibh sibh feoil, (Come hither, children of the hounds, and you‚Äôll get flesh). Afterwards, although Cameron thanked Gormshuil on his way home, she replied that 'Despite your words of kindness you will hang my son some day.' Many years later Gormshuil's son was charged with murder. But on her way to see Lochiel at his castle to beg for his life and remind Cameron of his promise, Gormshuil drowned. She had spotted a salmon in a pool and when trying to catch it she fell into the flooded burn.

Little is known about his life.  Family background  The Caelian Hill, which gave its name to Caeliomontanus. Caeliomontanus belonged to the patrician gens Verginia, which was of Etruscan origin, arriving to Rome with the Tarquins. They originally only bore the cognomen Tricostus. The first member of the family to reach the consulship was Opiter Verginius Tricostus in 502, in the early years of the Roman Republic.Broughton, vol. I, p. 8. The patrician Verginii soon separated in two branches, one living on the Esquiline Hill, the other on the Caelian Hill, thus taking the additional cognomen Esquilinus and Caeliomontanus.Ogilvie, Commentary, p. 516. The Fasti Capitolini are missing between 449 and 423, so Caeliomontanus' filiation has not been preserved.Degrassi, Fasti, pp. 32, 33. Friedrich M√ºnzer and Hans Georg Gundel thought he was the son of Spurius Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus, consul in 456, but it is improbable that he was consul just 8 years before his son.Hans Georg Gundel, PW, second series, vol. 16, pp. 1519, 1530. Robert Maxwell Ogilvie suggested instead Aulus Verginius, consul in 469, as his father, with a more credible 21 years gap between them.Ogilvie, Commentary, pp. 515, 516.  Career  Caeliomontanus' career is completely unknown apart from his consulship. He was elected consul posterior in 448, with Lars Herminius Aquilinus as consul prior, which means the Centuriate Assembly elected Aquilinus before Caeliomontanus.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, xi. 51.Taylor & Broughton, \\"The Order of the Two Consuls' Names\\", p. 6.Broughton, vol. I, p. 50. Their year of office was relatively peaceful, as neither consul took sides during the Conflict of the Orders, the social struggle that opposed patricians and plebeians during the first two centuries of the Republic. Livy adds that they did not wage any military campaign.Livy, iii. 65.

At the same time, Gregory of Durr√´s (often confused with Gregory the Printer) was the rector. Later he worked in Venice with typographer Nikolaos Glykys. In 1744 Gregory founded the printing press of Voskopoja, brought from Venice, which he operated until its destruction in 1764, which was used for liturgical purposes. He was the first to translate the Old and New Testament into Albanian, using an alphabet invented by himself before 1772. His translations have been lost however. After the abolition of the Ohrid Patriarchate in 1768, he was appointed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople as Metropolitan of Durr√´s. At the end of his life, he donated many books to the local library. He is said to have died in Venice in 1769. Another theory approximates his death in 1772 in Shen Gjon Vladimir in Shijon in Elbasan.

It is now in the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego. Background In 1553, Bruegel left Antwerp to study in Italy. He passed through and made sketches of the Alps on his return trip. These drawings influenced the mountains seen in the upper right background. Analysis The painting depicts the Parable of the Sower found in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke and is among the earliest signed paintings and large-scale landscapes by Bruegel. The sower himself is seen spreading seeds in the lower left foreground. A church and a Flemish village line the river that runs from the lower right to the upper left of the painting. On the right bank of the river, near a small group of boats, Jesus is seen preaching the titular parable to a crowd. John Wilson, executive director of the Timken Museum, finds that the painting exhibits the detail, religiosity, and human element found in Bruegel's later paintings. He explains, \\"Bruegel totally humanizes the spiritual nature of this religious subject matter...Little things catch your eye, like the tower of a church, the thatched hut, birds and horses.\\" Larry Silver of the University of Pennsylvania suggests a parallel between the significance of the painting and the meaning of the parable. He writes that the painting \\"uses the image of a sower, whose seeds were partly devoured by birds, partly fruitless when they fell upon stony soil or were choked by thorns, and partly successful when they found fertile soil. Brilliantly, therefore, Bruegel selected Jesus‚Äôs first parable as the subject for his own inaugural landscape painting, a work that planted the seed for his own affinity with landscape.\\" References Category:1557 paintings Category:Paintings by Pieter Brueghel the Elder Category:Paintings based on New Testament parables Category:Landscape painting category:Paintings of the Timken Museum of Art ","title":"Parable of the Sower (Bruegel)"},{"id":"62200459","text":"Tullaghorton is a civil parish in the Barony of Iffa and Offa West, County Tipperary, Province of Munster Ireland.Genuki References See also * List of civil parishes of County Tipperary External links * Tullaghorton civil parish, South Tipperary Category:Civil parishes of Iffa and Offa West ","title":"Tullaghorton"},{"id":"62200475","text":"Viceroy Sarah is a 1935 historical play by the British writer Norman Ginsbury.

In 1849, Croft resided in the first purpose built chemistry laboratory in Canada in the \\"Round Room\\", now known as the Croft Chapter House. The Senate officially renamed the Chair of Chemistry and Experimental Philosophy to be known as the Department of Chemistry in 1880. After 1894, the department moved from the Old Chemistry Building to the Wallberg Building, before finally moving to the Lash Miller Laboratories in 1964, which is where the department resides today. In 1986, Professor John Polanyi became the first faculty member in the department to win the Nobel Prize in chemistry. He, along with Professor Dudley R. Herschbach of Harvard University and Professor Yuan T. Lee of UC Berkeley were recognized for \\"for their contributions concerning the dynamics of chemical elementary processes.\\"  Scientific discoveries  Brook Rearrangement In the late 1950s, Adrian Brook discovered a rearrangement reaction in organosilicon chemistry that was later named the Brook rearrangement.

Although authorised, with the conditions of award and the design approved and announced, production had not begun prior to the end of the war and the award was never issued. It was one of a number of campaign shields authorised by the German authorities during the war. Criteria for award The Warsaw uprising lasted 63 days from 1 August 1944. The Polish resistance attempted to liberate Warsaw as German forces withdrew. However, the approaching Red Army temporarily halted outside the city, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the uprising. During the fighting German forces committed numerous atrocities, and then razed the city in reprisal. The Warsaw Shield was instituted on 10 December 1944 by Adolf Hitler, with full award regulations published in the Reich Law Gazette. It was to be \\"awarded as a battle badge to members of the armed forces and non- military personnel who, between 1 August and 2 October 1944 were honourably engaged in the fighting in Warsaw\\". The award was to be made by SS- Obergruppenfuhrer Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, who had overall commanded during the operation. Service between 1 August and 2 October 1944 qualified for the shield provided that the recipient had: *spent at least seven days in combat; or *served at least 28 days in the combat area in a non-combat capacity; or *flown at least 20 Luftwaffe missions over the combat zone. There was no minimum period if the recipient had been wounded in action or decorated for gallantry. Foreign volunteers serving alongside German forces qualified on the same basis. Design The award was to be a 50 √ó 62 mm bronze-coloured shield showing a large Wehrmacht-style eagle with folded wings grasping a writhing snake. A mobile swastika is superimposed on the eagle's neck with, immediately below, a narrow banner with the legend \`WARSCHAU 1944\`. It was designed by Benno von Arent, his still-existing original artwork confirming the design. The shield was to be worn on the left upper arm of the uniform. Dies were prepared, but were destroyed in an air-raid and no shields were actually produced before the end of the war. However, some sample matrices for the shield survived and have been used as the basis for the post-war manufacture of unofficial examples. Post war Wearing Nazi era decorations was banned after Germany's defeat in 1945, and the Warsaw Shield was not among those World War II military decorations authorised for wear by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. This means that examples produced since the war have no official standing, and public wear of the shield in its original form with the swastika would not be allowed under German law.

The district was originally established as a civil township in 1863, and converted into a magisterial district in 1872.\\"Division of the County into Districts\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County, West Virginia, H.H. Hardesty & Co., New York, Toledo, and Chicago (1883). When Jackson County was redistricted in the 1990s, the area of Grant District was included in the new Northern Magisterial District. However, the county's historic magisterial districts continue to exist in the form of tax districts, serving all of their former administrative functions except for the election of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. Geography Grant District is the northernmost of Jackson County's historic magisterial districts. To the north, it is bounded by Wood County, to the east by Wirt County, to the south by Ravenswood District, and to the west by the Ohio River.\\"Grant District\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. In Wood County, it is bounded by Harris and Steele Districts; in Wirt County by the Southwest Magisterial District, formerly Tucker and Reedy Districts. Across the river in Ohio are Olive and Lebanon Townships in Meigs County.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Belleville Quadrangle (ed. Mar. 1906).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, Ohio‚ÄìWest Virginia, Keno Quadrangle (ed. Nov. 1907).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Ravenswood Quadrangle (eds. Oct. 1908, 1960, rev. 1987).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Ripley Quadrangle (eds. 1907, 1928). Most of Grant District consists of rolling hills, with a fertile soil containing various mixtures of red, white, and blue clays, suitable for agriculture, orchards, and timber. The best agricultural soil is found in the bottomlands along the Ohio River, which runs along the western boundary of Grant District for eight miles. At Muses Bottom, the soil consists of a sandy loam with light clay. The district also includes Buffington Island, a large island in the Ohio River above Ravenswood. =Streams= The main streams in Grant District are Little Sandy Creek, which flows westward and empties into the Ohio River opposite Buffington Island; Little Pond Creek, which flows northward out of the center of the district, and enters Wood County; and the Left Fork of Sandy Creek, which drains the western part of the district, and flows southward, joining Nesselroad Run just south of the district line. Besides these, the Cabin Fork of Pond Creek, most of which is in Wood County, is in the northern part of the district; and several smaller creeks flow into the Ohio River, including Robison Run, Washington Run, Wheaton Run, and Skull Run. Tributaries of Little Sandy Creek include Negro Run, the Meathouse Fork, Claylick Run, and Roadfork Run, all of which flow south and east out of the hills around Shafer Knob, before joining Little Sandy. Claylick divides into Right and Left Forks, while Hogtrail Run is a tributary of Roadfork.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Pond Creek Quadrangle (eds. 1960, 1994). Little Pond Creek runs north of the same ridge that gives rise to the tributaries of Little Sandy. Its tributaries include the Bear Branch, Lamps Run, Jesse Run, and Bailey Run, all of which flow northwest into the main body of the creek, while Logston Run and Bee Run flow into Little Pond Creek from the northeast. Gunneltree Run is a tributary of Lamps Run, while Jesse Run divides into Right and Left Forks. Bailey Run flows into Wood County before joining Little Pond Creek, about half a mile above the junction of Little Pond Creek with the main branch of Pond Creek in Wood County. From there, Pond Creek flows westward through the hills until it reaches the Ohio at the village of Pond Creek, with its mouth straddling the county line. Nesselroad Run flows southward from the hills along the Wood county line, and is joined by another Skull Run, Rush Run, another Bee Run, Maulecamp Run, Cherry Run, Buck Run, Redbush Run, Coon Run, which flows just south of the district line, and Parsons Run; Blood Run is a tributary of Redbush. The upper waters of the Left Fork of Sandy Creek reach all the way into Wirt and Wood Counties. Joining the Left Fork south of the Wirt County line is the Brushy Fork, which along with its tributary, Sandy Run, extend into Wirt County. The creek is then joined by the Lockhart Fork, flowing westward out of the hills forming the western boundary of Wirt County; its tributaries include Niggletwist Run and Kelball Run. The Left Fork is then joined by Harris Run, also called Farley Run, coming from the northwest, and finally by McGraw Run, flowing southward, about a mile above the mouth of Nesselroad Run.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Rockport Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1975). =Communities= There are no incorporated towns in Grant District, but there are many unincorporated communities. Located along the Ohio River, from north to south, are Lone Cedar and Neptune; Murraysville, on the point opposite Long Bottom, Ohio; Polk above Muses Bottom; Muses Bottom; Morgan below Muses Bottom; Skull Run and Portland Station below the mouth of Skull Run, and opposite Portland, Ohio;United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Liverpool Quadrangle (ed. 1994). and Sherman, at the mouth of Little Sandy Creek. The former village of Brewster was just above Polk, while Runkle was between Muses Bottom and Morgan. Other villages in Grant District include Utica on the Cabin Fork; Willowdale and Topins Grove on Little Pond Creek; and Low Gap, in the hills above Skull Run. The former village of Browning was above Willowdale on Little Pond Creek. In the far eastern portion of the district is the village of McClain, located atop Limestone Ridge, on the Wirt County line. Along Little Sandy Creek and its tributaries are Cuba and Nesselroad, the latter located on the Meathouse Fork. The former village of Mozelle was on Roadfork Run. On the Left Fork of Big Sandy Creek are Wiseburg, near Shepherd Chapel, and Lockhart, formerly Buttermilk, below McGraw Run; and Medina, where Nesselroad Run joins with Maulecamp. The former village of Beatysville, was on the upper course of Nesselroad Run. =Roads and transportation= The main highway running through Grant District is West Virginia Route 68, which runs between Ravenswood and Parkersburg, and County Road 21, locally known as \\"Parkersburg Road\\", which runs between Ripley and Parkersburg. Interstate 77 runs through the district on its way from Charleston to Parkersburg, but the only exit in the district is at Medina. A railroad runs along the Ohio River between Ravenswood and Parkersburg. Formerly part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the line is now part of CSX.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, Ohio‚ÄìWest Virginia, Portland Quadrangle (ed. 1994). There are no bridges over the Ohio in Grant District; but until the twentieth centuries there were several ferries: one between Murraysville and Long Bottom, Ohio; one from Brewster to Hazael, Ohio; and one from Skull Run to Portland, Ohio. History The first European settler in Grant District was John DeWitt, who settled at Muses Bottom in 1807. He was soon followed by John Boso, Thomas DeWitt, John Powers, Thomas Coleman, Elias Nesselroad, and others, who settled in the same vicinity. John Powers built a water-powered grist mill near the mouth of Topins Creek in 1809. The first settler child was Daniel Staats, son of Elijah Staats and Margaret Alkire, in 1813. A log schoolhouse was built at Muses Bottom in 1818. Frederick Amrine built the district's first sawmill in 1829. Until 1831, the area of Jackson County was divided between Wood County, Mason County, and Kanawha County, West Virginia. All of Grant District lay within the boundaries of Wood County. With the establishment of the new county, the United States Post Office Department began appointing postmasters to handle the mail. Thomas Coleman was appointed postmaster at Muses Bottom in 1839.United States Post Office Department, Record of Appointment of Postmasters, 1832‚Äì1971, NARA Microfilm Publication M841, Virginia, Fluvanna‚ÄìJefferson Counties, p. 95. On July 19, 1863, at the height of the Civil War, the Battle of Buffington Island took place on the western edge of the district. The action was part of Morgan's Raid, a Confederate cavalry incursion through Indiana and Ohio. Most of the battle took place along the Ohio shore, rather than on Buffington Island itself, but some skirmishing occurred there, as Confederate troops tried to cross the river into West Virginia; and as the most significant feature in the area, the island gave its name to the battle. West Virginia had only been admitted to the Union as an independent state on June 20 of that year. Eleven days after the battle, on July 31, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act requiring the division of the counties into civil townships. Section five of the bill appointed George L. Kennedy, John Johnson, Robert R. Riley, Abraham Slaughter, and George Click to establish Jackson County's townships. Grant was one of the five original townships of Jackson County.United States Census Bureau, U.S. Decennial Census, Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870‚Äì2010. The original purpose of the townships was to provide for local government, as well as local control over revenue and the newly-created system of free public schools. However, the rural nature of the state proved an impediment to participation in township government, and revenues fell far below expectations. In 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, serving various administrative purposes, but having no governmental function.Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, West Virginia: A History, 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240. Grant District was thickly forested at the time of its settlement. Hardesty's mentions \\"white oak, black oak, red oak, chestnut oak, hickory, [tulip] poplar, pine, beech and sugar [maple]\\" as the important timber. However, in the latter part of the century, Grant, along with the rest of Jackson County, was heavily logged for \\"lumber, staves, and railroad ties, many hundred thousand of the two latter being shipped annually.\\" Trees along the river major streams were harvested first, with logging operations spreading from there to the interior.\\"Geographical and Physical\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. By 1883, the timber supply in all but the eastern part of Grant District had been exhausted. The names and boundaries of Jackson County's magisterial districts remained relatively unchanged until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. All of Grant District and part of Ravenswood District were included in the new Northern Magisterial District. However, redistricting in a number of counties created confusion with land and tax records, so the legislature provided for the establishment of tax districts, following the lines of the historic magisterial districts, and serving all administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials. As a result, Grant District remains an administrative unit of Jackson County, although it is no longer one of the magisterial districts.

The game was designed by Troy Christensen and Rick Slawson, with cover art by Jeff and Amanda Dee. The game components are: * 24-page 5.5\\" x 8.5\\" rulebook * 8.5\\" x 11\\" world map * 8.5\\" x 11\\" hex map * a sheet of counters =Character generation= Each character has four attributes: Might, Body Mutilation Capacity (BMC), Bloodlust, and Skill. =Combat= Players roll dice for initiative, with bonuses applied for Bloodlust. To attack, each character has a movement of six hexes, unless burdened by armor or other encumbrances. The attacker then roll three 6-sided dice, trying to total higher than the defender's pplicable talent rating. If the hit is successful, the attacker rolls two 6-sided die for damage, adds the character's Might, as well as any applicable weapon bonus, subtracts the amount of armor the defender is wearing and for Dodge if the defender successfully made a Dodge skill check; the balance is applied against the defender's BMC. If an attacker scores more than four points of damage, the player references a special Damage Chart for special extra damage that ranges from \\"Bloody Wound\\" to \\"Where's the Mop?\\" =Other information= The game also provides information about the fictional world of Hel, as well as monsters and other creatures that inhabit the lands. The rulebook also contains a short sample adventure. Further supplements In 1988, T.C. International published a supplement to Bloodbath called Bloodchant. Reception In the May 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue #193), Lester Smith was ambivalent about Bloodbath, saying \\"I don't recommend this game for the squeamish.\\" He found the production values \\"an amateurish production\\", and the level of writing and editing poor: \\"the text is full of typographical errors, slipshod sentences, and just plain mistakes.\\" Smith did admit to enjoy reading through the rules, and he did like the combat system.

It is the second of two bridges on the same site. The original bridge opened in March 2013 and was demolished in late 2019, being replaced by the current bridge in April 2020. Designed by Theodore Zoli, the original structure became known as a boondoggle due to various problems with its construction, including too much bounce and deterioration of its timbers. The bridge initially cost $4.1 million to construct, but the cost of repairs ultimately ended up making the total cost $7.5 million. The current bridge, designed by Arup Group and built by Turner Construction, is made of steel.  Original bridge  HNTB Corporation, the engineering firm of Theodore Zoli, was contracted to build the bridge by the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation. The bridge was announced in April 2012 and was constructed from December 2012 to March 2013. Its purpose was to let people travel from Brooklyn Bridge Park's Pier 1 to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade and Squibb Park. Built from black locust timber supported by galvanized steel cables and mounted on concrete pillars, it was meant to have some degree of bounce when people walked across, based on catwalks found in state parks. The wooden design was meant to be a \\"stepping stone\\" for sustainable vehicular bridges in rural areas. = Structural concerns and demolition = The bounce became more pronounced over time, and the bridge also began moving from side to side in an unintended way, worrying pedestrians. The bridge was closed on August 11, 2014, for repairs due to a \\"misalignment\\", though at the time park officials expressed confidence in the bridge's design. The bridge remained closed for the next two years. More than two years after this closing, park officials determined that the bridge's design was \\"inherently flawed\\" and filed suit against the bridge's designers. The park spent $3.4 million on repairs to the bridge, including dampers to reduce the bounciness. The lawsuit was settled for $1.95 million with no admission of wrongdoing. The bridge reopened in April 2017, but was closed again in mid-2018 after the wood had started deteriorating significantly, despite the wood's properties as being \\"extremely rot-resistant\\". Retrofitting the bridge would have cost almost the same as rebuilding it, in addition to maintenance costs. The original bridge was torn down in October 2019.  New bridge  A steel replacement was designed by Arup and constructed by Turner. The steel replica was initially expected to be completed by December 2020. It was completed ahead of schedule in April 2020, and opened to the public on May 4, 2020.

Logan and Alison J. Tierney of the Roper‚ÄìLogan‚ÄìTierney model of nursing used widely in nurse training in the United Kingdom, USA and Europe, since mid-1970s.  Life and early career  Nancy Roper was born on 29 September 1918, at Wetheral, near Carlisle, England, her mother was a nanny. Roper had wanted to be a nurse as a child. Her initial training was as a registered sick children's nurse (gaining a gold medal at Booth Hall Hospital, Manchester). After this she trained as a state registered (adult) nurse in 1943, winning student nurse medals at Leeds General Infirmary. Roper was called up to the Territorial Army as a nurse teacher, in World War II, although teaching was a reserved occupation. Her next role was as a teaching staff nurse, and then senior tutor at Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, following completing a sister tutor diploma from London University in 1950.  Later career  Roper was invited to join the Royal College of Nursing study tour in Belgium in 1954. She became an Examiner for the General Nursing Council. She also worked on updating the Oakes Dictionary for Nurses, which was published in 1961. From 1964, Roper was a self-employed lexicographer and author. Roper won a British Commonwealth Nurses War Memorial Fellowship to study for MPhil at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1970. Her international studies in nurse education also included USA and Canada. Her practical and theoretical question was simply What is nursing?' which led to a thesis on 'Clinical Experience in Nurse Education' and identified that most nursing skills and interventions related to daily activities of patients. Roper proposed the first organised approach to nurse care planning, which was researched and refined to become a model of Activities of Living (and known as Roper‚ÄìLogan‚ÄìTierney model of nursing). Roper was (from 1974-1978) the first nursing research officer for the Scottish Home and Health Department, working with the Chief Scientist, and carried out assignments for the World Health Organisation (WHO) European Office. The collaboration with Tierney and Logan continued with the writing of the Elements of Nursing in 1980. Roper wrote in the British Journal of Nursing in 2002, that as early as when a student nurse she was not happy that rotating wards for different experiences was useful, as there were 'more similarities than differences in nursing patients with different conditions'. The British Journal of Nursing (BJN) Lifetime Achievement Award was given to Roper in 2003, at the Savoy in London. Meeting Roper at the event, BJN editor, Helen Scott said that Roper was \\"affectionate, open, caring.. mischievous sense of humour' and put people at ease. And Scott reported that in her acceptance speech, Roper said she was 'humbled by the work that practical nurses carry out on a daily basis'.  Roper's Model of Nursing  Roper‚Äôs model of nursing, researched with Tierney and Logan, was originally published in 1976, and revised in 1985 and 1990, and 1998, and it remains the widely-used model of nursing used in the United Kingdom. It is now used as framework for nursing in America and on the continent of Europe with a history of being used particularly well in medical and surgical settings. Nursing methods developed from the activities of living and enhanced for use in a wider range of care settings, include for managing care in the community. A model of activities of daily living was later extended to cover Instrumental Activities of Daily Living for assessing ageing or disabled people's capability to live independently self-managing finances, domestic chores, socialising and communications. Roper's approach was more holistic as well as practical and reminded the nurse to look at the whole patient's needs, their capabilities and their past, present and future experiences. \\"The Roper-Logan-Tierney model is based upon activities of living, which evolved from the work of Virginia Henderson in 1966. The activities of daily living are the key to the model of care which seeks to define ‚Äúwhat living means:‚Äù * maintaining a safe environment * communication * breathing * eating and drinking * elimination * washing and dressing * temperature control * mobilization * working and playing * expressing sexuality * sleeping * death and dying The factors that influence activities of living are biological, psychological, sociocultural, environmental, and politicoeconomic. These factors make the model holistic, and if they are not included in assessment, it will be both incomplete and flawed.\\"  Death and Legacy  Roper died in Edinburgh 5 October 2004, and tributes were paid in nursing and general publications. However both the Nursing Times said she had 'influenced generations of nurses' and he British Journal of Nursing also noted that Roper received neither a state honour nor a Royal College of Nursing fellowship. The nursing process model her research developed had by then been used in research on the computerisation of nursing care management information: * \\"To record nursing care rapidly, clearly and concisely using the precepts of the nursing process. * To acquire accurate information to plan and implement nursing care.\\" In her obituary, a lecturer in nurse education, John Adams, said in The Independent, that Roper was both innovative and practical: > 'When I was a student 30 years ago I would have found her list of activities > very helpful. It is difficult to realise it now, but then there was no > recognised framework. So you somehow had to remember everything from > scratch. The very simplicity of the model helps to explain its universal > usefulness.' And in her obituary the Nursing Standard recognised the longevity of her contribution: > \\"Nancy Roper was a theorist whose influence on nursing is worldwide. For 50 > years her research provided the framework for adult nursing. She had shown > no inclination to retire and recently made a powerful intervention at a > conference in Edinburgh.\\" The Royal College of Nursing executive director, Alison Kitson said: ‚ÄòNancy was an inspiration to her profession. She combined clear thinking with compassion and has left a treasured legacy through her work around activities of daily living in nursing.‚Äô  See also  * Alison J.

This spy thriller is the last film produced by Piotr Wo≈∫niak-Starak, who died in an apparent boating accident shortly before the premiere. Plot The film starts with a text card setting the historical background: it is the height of the Cold War, with Soviet troops stationed in Cuba after the revolution, and President Kennedy being informed in 1962 that the USSR is likely preparing for war, with the Cuban Missile Crisis unfolding. The first scene is one of a Grandmaster chess match. One of the players (the American) walks onto the stage, towards the table where the other player (the Russian) is already sitting. The American looks dazed and has a blood stain on his hand. We cut back to 7 days before where the American chess player, an unkempt middle aged man, is talking to a taxi driver who addresses him as \\"professor\\" and drops him off at his New York apartment. As the chess player walks in, a car pulls up outside the apartment. In a bar, the chess player is in a card game with three others; he casually makes a remark about the destructive power of the Soviet Tsar Bomba, and switches off a TV news report about an upcoming chess match between Soviet champion Alexander Gavrylov and the American Konigsberg. The chess player wins the card game, takes the money and then receives his cut from the bartender - this seems to be a source of income for the chess player. A woman in the bar, Agent Stone, approaches the chess player, whom she recognises as Joshua Mansky, her former lecturer and a former champion chess player. She has a proposition for him, but Mansky immediately walks out of the bar before hearing it; he is followed out of the bar by a man, Agent White, who grabs him and forces him into the back of the car that was waiting outside Mansky's apartment. It is later revealed that Mansky knew Stone was lying because in all his years of teaching, he never had a female student. Mansky's kidnappers take him onboard a plane, drugged; he wakes up in a US embassy in another country, in a safe room where their conversations are secure, and meets Agent Novak, who leads the operation. Mansky is a mathematical genius, who defeated Konigsberg 20 years before, but has an unpredictable temperament. He is informed he has some part to play in \\"winning the Cold War\\". He is told he will have to compete in a chess tournament against Alexander Gavrylov of the Soviet Union in the Polish capital Warsaw, as Konigsberg has died (by Soviet poisoning). Per tournament rules, Mansky is the only eligible substitute for Konigsberg because he was the last person to beat him. However, Mansky's drinking problem becomes apparent when he is found unconscious in his hotel room. Amphetamine drugs are used to make him regain consciousness before he has to go to the chess match stage to make his first official appearance as the replacement American player. He is unable to make the first ceremonial move on the chess board after his opponent, as he sees 8900 moves at one time. Mansky is housed in a hotel located in the building where the match takes place, the Palace of Culture and Science, and meets the hotel director, Alfred Slega, who also seems to like alcohol. The hotel director is told by a Soviet general major (General Krutov, Soviet counter-intelligence) to \\"look after\\" Mansky, implying he will keep the American chess player drunk. The film cuts to 4 days before the opening scene. Mansky recalls he got drunk with the hotel director in the morning and does not recall the day at all, including the first chess game. Agent Stone reveals that he won the game in only 32 moves. Mansky's eccentric behaviour and alcoholism is revealed to be partly due to his sheer brilliance, with alcohol slowing his brain function enough to operate more normally. The Russian general major meets Gavrylov, and encourages him to keep playing on despite losing the first match. He tells Alfred to deny alcohol to the American delegation. However, Mansky is still able to get alcohol, smuggling it out of social events accompanying the match. In the second game, a hypnotist in the audience blocks Mansky's thoughts and Mansky concedes the game. Agent White pursues the hypnotist out of the chess game theatre, but is stopped by members of the Soviet group who threaten his family, who they know a lot about, including the fact that his wife is pregnant. Among the tournament attendees is a Soviet officer, who is secretly working for the Americans. Agent White tells Agent Stone they call him Gift, but does not mention how Gift can be identified. Alfred befriends Mansky, and visits him via a secret back door in a wardrobe in Mansky's room that allows passage into the toilets in the lobby, where he hides some alcohol for Mansky to secretly use as needed. He shares his personal experience of Soviet influence over communist Poland with Mansky, and views the Warsaw Pact as merely a continuation of the Nazi occupation. This is despite the fact that Alfred possesses a little red book (an identification of a member of the ruling party) that makes him a privileged person in communist Poland, and shields him from questioning by the police and the Soviets. Together, they sneak in and out of the hotel through the Warsaw sewers. They go to a bar where they meet many of Alfred's friends, who cheer for Mansky, not Gavrylov, in the match, and who are sympathetic to the US and like American culture. The next day Agent White visits Mansky‚Äôs room, which is now shown to be bugged by the Soviets. He tells Mansky that a man in a Soviet uniform might approach him; that man can be trusted, and has a scar on the back of his right hand. Before Agent White can say anything else, he starts vomiting blood and dies in Mansky‚Äôs arms, poisoned with Ricin. Agent Stone asks Mansky why Agent White came into his room. Mansky says the room is bugged, but Agent Stone tells him the room is clean. Mansky becomes distraught, and Stone takes him to the US embassy (it is announced that Mansky fell ill; the third game is considered a draw due to his feigned illness), where they brief him on the events in Cuba. The agents tell Mansky about John Gift, a code name for a high ranking Soviet officer who is a double agent for Americans; only Agent White was working with him. Gift was going to deliver the blueprints of the Soviet warheads destined for Cuba, but the Soviets stung the Americans in Moscow, with the assistance of a spy within the American intelligence. Gift was coming to Warsaw for the tournament along with other Soviet officers, which gives Gift an opportunity to provide critical information to the Americans regarding Soviet capabilities and intentions in Cuba. The Americans want to know if Soviet nuclear warheads are already in Cuba, or if the first warheads are yet to arrive. Gift knows he can trust Mansky, as Mansky clearly cannot be a spy. Agent Stone tells Mansky he needs to get the microfilm of the blueprints, hidden in a champagne cork, from Gift. To allow this, Mansky needs to make the next game a draw, to ensure the Soviet delegation comes to the after-match social event. General Krutov talks to a member of his staff about his impressions of an American book, describing postwar history, that he apparently came across: in the book Americans portray Soviets as buffoons, or as mindless followers of orders of bloodthirsty psychopaths. It is possible Krutov found that incriminating book among the staff member's belongings. Krutov says that what Americans call a democracy is a system in which they \\"treat women like servants\\" and \\"won't even let black people use the same shitter\\", perpetuate social inequality between the rich and the workers, and force poorer nations to give away their riches to the USA, waging war against those who nationalize their industries instead of following the American model. While explaining this, an angry Krutov makes the staff member spread out his fingers, and takes stabs with a knife (at the book) in between the staff member's fingers. Mansky relates to Agent Stone his prior assistance to Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, which birthed the profoundly destructive power of nuclear weapons into human hands, for which he remains regretful. During the fourth game, Mansky often looks at the audience, his mind obviously not on the game, wondering who might be John Gift. In a break period, he goes to the lobby toilets to drink some of the hidden alcohol, whereupon General Krutov‚Äôs staff member (the one Krutov was talking to earlier) enters his cubicle and hands him a cork. Agent Stone then enters the cubicle, and tells Mansky to keep the cork when Mansky tries to give it to her. Then both she and the Soviet staff member are attacked and killed in the toilet by a man in a Soviet uniform. Mansky returns to the game, which is the opening scene of the film. His brain, suddenly transformed by the alcohol, switches on and he proposes a draw. His opponent turns this down disdainfully, as Mansky is clearly in a bad position from the earlier passage of play. Mansky then makes a number of quick moves in the game interspersed by countermoves by an increasingly frustrated Gavrylov. When he again proposes a draw, Gavrylov agrees and he applauds Mansky, squaring the series 2-2. When Mansky asks to go back to the US embassy, he is told the American delegation is quarantined in the hotel. Mansky goes back to his room, and the usual social event after the match carries on without him, the rest of the Soviet delegation being present along with Gavrylov. Alfred smuggles some alcohol out of the event and brings it to Mansky‚Äôs room via the secret entrance in the wardrobe. Mansky asks him for help; Alfred switches on the radio loud, clearly knowing the room is bugged. Alfred says he cannot help Mansky leave the hotel, but gives him the red book, and says to not allow the Soviets to trace it back to him in case Mansky gets caught. Mansky goes into the lobby toilets via the secret passageway, and escapes into the city to head to the US embassy. The world is now 24 hours from a confrontation between the USA and the USSR. At the US embassy, in the safe room, he recounts the events to Agent Novak. The man who killed both Stone and the Soviet staff member seems to be Gift. After he killed Stone, he revealed a syringe full of alcohol in Stone's purse; apparently, Stone was going to kill Mansky by injecting alcohol straight into his bloodstream and make it look like accidental death from alcohol overdose. Gift gave Mansky another cork, and soaked the one Mansky had gotten earlier in Stone‚Äôs blood, to mark is as the bad one. He then told Mansky to remember the word \\"rakirovka\\". Novak says it is not clear to him whether Stone was a Soviet spy or not, and he has four hours to give President Kennedy a decision on whether to place a blockade around Cuba or not. Mansky is not sure who to trust, as Agent White did not tell Novak that Gift has a scar on his hand. Novak tells Mansky that the cork soaked in Stone‚Äôs blood says the nuclear weapons are already in Cuba; the one given by Gift suggests the Soviets are bluffing. President Kennedy wants to communicate with Mansky by secure telegram. Mansky wonders whether Gift is not on the Americans' side at all. Mansky explains his reasoning, invoking \\"the riddle of the two guards\\", and passes a message to the President. Kennedy announces a naval blockade of Cuba, which is going to stop any ship carrying military material from reaching Cuba. Novak thanks Mansky; Mansky tells him to thank Gift instead. General Krutov and the Soviets find the dead bodies in the lobby toilet. Krutov also discovers Mansky‚Äôs secret alcohol, realising that Alfred the hotel director must have befriended Mansky. With Kennedy‚Äôs announcement, Krutov realizes that the Soviets have lost this battle; he orders a search for the spy in their midst; in addition, he has Alfred summoned, and tortures him. Alfred accidentally reveals the existence of a secret passageway leading from the building through the sewers into the city. Novak tells Mansky that \\"rakirovka\\" (castling) was a code word meaning imminent danger: Gift needs extraction. At the fifth and deciding game, Mansky sees Gift outside in the lobby. A man in Soviet uniform is then seen exiting the hotel via the secret passages Mansky has been using all this time, whilst Gavrylov awaits for Mansky to appear at the chess table. At the exit of the secret passages into an alley leading into the streets of Warsaw, Krutov and his team are waiting. The man in the Soviet uniform - whom they apprehend when he comes out of the secret passages - is actually Mansky, whilst Gift uses the red book which Alfred gave to Mansky to simply walk out of the cordoned-off hotel. Gift is wearing Mansky‚Äôs clothes. Novak rushes into the alley and stops Krutov from killing Mansky as he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Mansky cannot appear in the final game, which is forfeit, and Gavrylov wins the tournament. Novak flies Mansky back to the US. The press at the airport accuse Mansky of having humiliated the US, despite him having prevented a nuclear war without their knowing. Novak says to Mansky he cannot determine Stone's motivation for betraying the US. He tells Mansky that he is a citizen hero and will be looked after, and hands him a hip flask. Novak exits the car; Gift enters the car to join Mansky and gives him Alfred‚Äôs red book, saying that Alfred was killed. Gift says he has seen the Soviet order of attack. Mansky tells Gift that Novak wants to take care of them - but hands the hip flask to Gift, and leaves the car, saying he does not want Novak‚Äôs protection. Talks commence between the United States and the Soviet Union, which result in mutual de-escalation steps, such as the withdrawal of nuclear-tipped missiles from some territories. The final montage goes on to mention later nuclear arms control agreements such as the INF of 1987, and later US assistance with nuclear disarmament in former communist countries in the Eastern Bloc after the revolutions of 1989. However, the epilogue notes: \\"In February 2019, the United States suspended compliance with the INF treaty. The same day, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia also suspended the INF treaty and will develop new intermediate-range missiles.\\" The movie ends with the following quote: \\"Our moral imperative is to work with all powers for that day when the children of the world will grow up without the fear of nuclear war.\\" - Ronald Reagan.

William Hurt, originally cast as Joshua Mansky, suffered an accident while returning from the film set to his apartment, just a few days into shooting, and was replaced by Bill Pullman. The Coldest Game was the last film produced by Piotr Wo≈∫niak-Starak, who died shortly before the premiere. His death was ruled an accident. The cause of death was head trauma caused by a \\"sharp-edged tool\\", and it was claimed that the movie producer fell off his boat into a lake and had his head crushed by the propeller of his own boat. His cell phone remained on the boat. A 27-year-old woman who was also on the boat survived, and the movie producer's bodyguard reportedly attempted a suicide soon after.https://www.tokfm.pl/Tokfm/7,103085,25232756,sa-wyniki-sekcji-zwlok- piotra-wozniaka-staraka-podano-przyczyne.htmlhttps://tvn24.pl/polska/piotr- wozniak-starak-nie-zyje-przyczyna-smierci-niewydolnosc-krazeniowo-oddechowa- ra972202-2286611https://natemat.pl/282053,fakt-ochroniarz-piotra-wozniaka- staraka-probowal-popelnic-samobojstwo Release The film had its premiere at the 44th Gdynia Film Festival in September 2019 and received positive critics' reviews. It was scheduled to be launched in Polish cinemas on November 8, 2019. The international premiere is planned for early 2020. As of early 2020, Netflix is streaming The Coldest Game. Relationship to real events =Cuban Missile Crisis= An important question in the movie is whether the Soviets already have nuclear warheads in Cuba, or are yet to ship them to Cuba. As told by Soviet general Gribkov in 1992https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002-11/features/cuban-missile-crisis (and repeated in the 2003 book Wilson's Ghost by McNamara & Blight), Soviet forces in Cuba at that point did have nuclear warheads there: 162 of them, including at least 90 tactical nuclear warheads; these warheads were just 90 miles from US shores. Furthermore, on October 26, 1962, the warheads were moved from their storage sites to positions closer to their delivery vehicles, to be launched in case of American invasion. According to McNamara, the Americans did not believe Soviet warheads were already in CubaMcNamara and Blight, Wilson's Ghost: Reducing The Risk Of Conflict, Killing, And Catastrophe In The 21st Century (2003, pp. 189-190); if what Gribkov says is true, then the Americans decided on the course of action while not knowing how real the threat was. =The last vodka= The method of killing shown in the movie, dubbed \\"the last vodka\\" in the movie - injecting alcohol directly into the victim's bloodstream to fake accidental death from overdrinking - has long been alleged to be used by former communist secret service operatives in Poland to eliminate opponents and witnesses (or to perform example killings to scare others into silence). These allegations came mainly from anti- communists, including members of the opposition from the times when Poland was a one-party authoritarian communist state. A notable example is Sylwester Zych, a priest whom the police blamed for the death of one of their own. In 1989, Zych died, officially from alcohol poisoning, but surprisingly the concentration of alcohol in one of his arms was much higher than elsewhere in his body, suggesting the alcohol was injected in the arm, not taken orally.https://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/2338841,30-rocznica-smierci- ks-Sylwestra-Zycha-Na-celowniku-bezpieki-i-milicji (machine translation: 30th anniversary of the death of the priest Sylwester Zych.

Clear light yellow in colour and with roughly 20% ABV, it is one of the most well-known liqueurs in its country of origin. It's made from the seeds of the bitter almond, much like the italian Amaretto.  Origin/Production  Flowering Prunus dulcis var. amara, the bitter almond tree The Bitter Almond (Prunus dulcis var. amara), despite growing plentifully around the Algarve region, was never commonly harvested or consumed. This was due not only to its remarkably bitter flavour, but also to the high concentration of cyanide in its drupes, which can cause severe or even lethal effects if ingested in large amounts. When crushed, macerated and distilled, however; both the cyanide traces and bitter flavour are completely eliminated. The result of the lengthy process is a smooth and sweet liqueur, which bears no trace of the negative attributes of the raw material used in its production.  Brands  Bitter Almond Liqueur is currently produced by many different brands in Portugal, mostly brands originated in the southern part of the country, among which are notable Amarguinha, Licor de Am√™ndoas de Portugal, Xar√£o and Milbar.  Usage  Bitter Almond Liqueur is traditionally consumed as an aperitif, as a digestive or inside cocktails. It is also frequently served with ice and with a dash of lemon, its acidity being used to temper the sweetness of the liqueur.

After being chased by police for stealing clothing from a Walmart, Seacat barricaded himself in the Greenwood Village, Colorado house at 4219 South Alton Street. By the time Seacat was finally extracted from the premises, the house had been destroyed by law-enforcement in their efforts. The homeowner‚ÄîLeo Lech‚Äîfiled a lawsuit against the municipality for compensation, but was ruled against by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; he was considering appealing to the Supreme Court of the United States. Background Robert Jonathan Seacat (also Robert Seakat) was born in Kansas on . , he was tall, weighed , was residing in Aurora, Colorado, and was married to Ramona Vitalyevna Grabchenko. With previous convictions for drug possession, aggravated motor vehicle theft, and burglary, on June 3, 2015, Seacat also had three outstanding warrants: two for illegal drugs and one for aggravated motor vehicle theft. Leo and Alfonsia Lech bought the house at 4219 South Alton Street, Greenwood Village, Colorado for their son, John. In June 2015, John Lech was living in the house with his girlfriend‚ÄîAnna Mumzhiyan‚Äîand her nine-year-old son; John Lech paid his father per month for the house. John Lech would later tell police that he kept an unloaded pistol and 20-gauge shotgun in the master closet, while ammunition was kept elsewhere in the house. John Lech's 2003 Nissan Xterra was parked in the garage attached to 4219 South Alton; it was valued at . Standoff According to a police affidavit, it was June 3, 2015 when Seacat shoplifted two belts and a shirt from a Walmart in Greenwood Village, Colorado. After assaulting a uniformed Aurora Police Department (APD) officer‚ÄîJohn Reiter‚Äîwith his gold-colored 1999 Lexus GS300, Seacat fled in the vehicle. Reiter soon found the abandoned car at the nearby Dayton station and radioed for a tow; after watching Seacat run across northbound Interstate 225, a by-stander alerted the officer that she saw Seacat holster a .380 ACP semi-automatic pistol when he crossed the rail platform. Reiter lost track of Seacat and returned to the Lexus to inventory its contents: in cash, of psilocybin mushrooms, of cannabis, and an unidentified blue pill. Between 1:43‚Äì1:54pm, a perimeter was established by Greenwood Village (GVPD) and Aurora police. At 1:54pm, Seacat entered the home at 4219 South Alton Street in Greenwood Village, twice tripping the security alarm as he did so. Inside the home was the nine-year-old son of resident Anna Mumzhiyan, and when he exited the house at 2:17pm, the child described Seacat as the man currently inside the house. After Seacat began opening the garage doors, APD officer William Woods drove a marked departmental sport utility vehicle (SUV) into the garage door to block egress; Seacat responded by blindly firing his pistol through the garage door, striking the SUV approximately from Woods. GVPD Commander Dustin Varney arrived at South Alton Street, took command of the situation, and summoned GVPD SWAT as well as further assistance from the APD, the Arapahoe County sheriff's office, and the Douglas County sheriff's office. GVPD officer Mic Smith, a SWAT negotiator, engaged with Seacat over the telephone; by 6:08pm, Seacat ceased communicating with police, despite the application of inductive irritants. At 10:38pm, SWAT entered the house and used a stun grenade to conceal their movements, but were driven back outside by gunshots (though criminalists would later establish that they were not fired upon). During the next 10.2 hours, a Lenco BearCat was driven through the front door, tear gas and 40 mm grenades were repeatedly launched inside, shots were fired upon the house, and explosives were detonated to destroy several exterior walls. Ultimately, \\"the home was utterly destroyed\\" by the time Seacat was apprehended in the upstairs bathroom. According to police, at the time of his arrest, Seacat was carrying a loaded & chambered Glock 19 and of suspected methamphetamine. =Aftermath= In their subsequent search of the house, police found Lech's over and under shotgun‚Äîunloaded and still in its case. In the master bathroom, police found a loaded Glock 17, of suspected methamphetamine, of methadone, of diazepam, of suspected heroin, 17.5 pills of methylphenidate, of clonazepam, of cannabis, 61 packets of buprenorphine/naloxone, digital weighing scales, dozens of single-use baggies, used syringes and pipes, cash, and multiple cell phones. Another of suspected methamphetamine was found in the bathroom where Seacat was captured. Anthony Costarella, a GVPD officer specialized in narcotics, argued that this cache evidenced Seacat as a drug trafficker. It was determined that, during the standoff with police, not only was Seacat experiencing the effects of intentionally-ingested methamphetamine, but also from packets of drugs he had swallowed: at Swedish Hospital on June 6, Seacat defecated seven baggies that, with the addition of a Mecke reagent, tested positive for of heroin and of methamphetamine. On June 9, Detective John J. Carr of the GVPD applied for an arrest warrant on Seacat. The same day, the Arapahoe County, Colorado district attorney filed 32 charges against Seacat: 17 counts of attempted murder in the first degree, one count of first-degree burglary, one count of menacing, one count of attempted motor vehicle theft, four counts of criminal possession of a weapon, three counts of drug possession, one count of trespass, and four counts of being a habitual criminal. In August 2016, Seacat's jury trial was scheduled for that October 4. Leches' litigation When he returned to his house, Leo Lech said that it looked like Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad after Operation Neptune Spear: \\"[p]rojectiles were still lodged in the walls. Glass and wooden paneling crumbled on the ground below the gaping holes, and inside, the family's belongings and furniture appeared thrashed in a heap of insulation and drywall.\\" Varney defended the police's actions by saying, \\"My mission is to get that individual out unharmed and make sure my team and everyone else around including the community goes home unharmed [‚Ä¶] Sometimes that means property gets damaged, and I am sorry for that.\\" The National Tactical Officers Association supported Varney's assertion that appropriate force was used in the Seacat standoff. Due to the extensive damage, the house was eventually condemned by Greenwood Village, and the remains were razed. Leo Lech's family moved in with him hence, forcing John Lech to change jobs. The city refused to compensate the Leches, and instead offered \\"in temporary rental assistance and for the [home] insurance deductible.\\" Alleging that the house's value was , the Leches refused the 1% offer, calling it \\"insulting\\"; rebuilding the house cost Leo Lech . In a 2019 response to an NPR inquiry, Greenwood Village spokesperson Melissa Gallegos told the public broadcaster that it was Leo Lech's decision to: demolish rather than repair the house, replace the undamaged foundation, and build a larger house than the one that was damaged. In 2016, Leo Lech, his wife Alfonsia Lech, and John Lech filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado (D. Colo.) against the participating police officers and Greenwood Village under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 15 of the Constitution of Colorado. They claimed that they deserved compensation for \\"their property [being] seized by the government for public use\\" (Lech v. City of Greenwood Village), and were willing to settle with the city for . Instead, the defendants requested and were granted summary judgment by D. Colo., which ruled that \\"when a state acts pursuant to its police power, rather than the power of eminent domain, its actions do not constitute a taking\\". In the past, both the Minnesota and Texas Supreme Courts have sided with litigants whose houses were damaged or destroyed by police actions. The Leches appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (10th Cir.). In 2019, the three-judge panel of the 10th Cir. ruled against the Leches, saying unanimously that the destruction of the house fell under police power and that eminent domain was not undertaken. The court sympathized with the Leches, calling their circumstances \\"unfair\\", but ruling that police cannot be \\"burdened\\" with the consideration of collateral property damage when performing their duties. The 10th Cir. also noted that \\"if police officers 'willfully or wantonly' destroy property\\", then they can be subject to tort law; Leo Lech was also unsuccessful in pursuing that avenue with the courts of Colorado. , Lech had incurred in attorney's fees. On March 11, 2020, the Institute for Justice filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court denied certiorari on June 29, 2020, letting the lower court's ruling stand.

His ideas were taken up by creationists including Jehovah's Witnesses. Life Isaac Newton Vail was born to John Vail and Abigail (nee Edgerton) in Barnesville, Ohio in 1840\\\\. He was trained and then taught at the Quaker Seminary in Westtown, Pennsylvania, leaving to pursue his independent study of flood geology. He married Rachel D. Wilson in the fall of 1864; they had two daughters (Alice and Lydia). In 1876 Rachel died, and on 26 July 1880 Vail married his second wife Mary M. Cope in Salem, Ohio. The 1900 census records his occupation as a farmer.Bureau of the Census 1900 census. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1900. T623, 1854 rolls. Vail argued that the Earth once had rings like Saturn's, in what became known as the \\"Vailan theory\\" or \\"annular theory\\". His 1886 \\"Canopy Theory\\" proposed that the Earth had been ringed by a toroidal mass of ice, which he named the \\"firmament\\", following the usage in Genesis 1:6-8. Vail supposed that this could explain Noah's Flood, as he described in his 1874 book The Earth's Aqueous Ring: or The Deluge and its Cause.Vail, Isaac N. 1874. The Earth's Aqueous Ring: or The Deluge and its Cause, F. S. Hickman Publishers, West Chester, PA. Vail died on 26 January 1912 in Pasadena, California. Reception The geologist Donald U. Wise writes that most creationist theories of Noah's Flood derive from Vail. Wise writes that Vail's \\"Canopy Theory\\" model consisted of \\"a series of Saturn-like aqueous rings, the progressive collapse of which caused successive cataclysms to bury and create fossils. Collapse of the last remnant ring caused the Noachian flood.\\" which is an expanded version of Wise, Donald U. (1998) \\"Creationism's Geologic Time Scale\\", American Scientist, v. 86, p. 160-173. Tom McIver similarly notes in Skeptic that the \\"Water Canopy Theory has long been a mainstay of creationists\\", who invoke it to account for both the conditions before the Genesis flood and the cause of the flood itself. from The historian of science Ronald Numbers, in his book on creationism, writes that the founders of the Jehovah's Witnesses \\"borrowed their geology\\" from Vail. The Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience notes that, a century later, \\"members of the Fortean Society\\" support Vail's theory. The mathematician and science writer Martin Gardner in his book Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science wrote that Vail's theories were still being popularized in the 20th century by the Annular World Association of Azusa, California. The engineer Jane Albright notes several scientific failings of the canopy theory. Among these are that enough water to create a flood of even of rain would form a vapor blanket thick enough to make the earth too hot for life, since water vapor is a greenhouse gas; the same blanket would effectively obscure all incoming starlight.

A molecular geneticist, Barrett-Lennard uses DNA analysis to study the dispersal, mating habits, and group structure of killer whale sub-populations in the Pacific Northwest. He is best known for his research concerning the conservation of the southern resident killer whale sub-population. Currently, he is the director of the Marine Mammal Research Program headquartered at the Coastal Ocean Research Institute (CORI), a research branch of the Vancouver Aquarium.  Education  Lance Barrett-Lennard attained a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Guelph in Ontario (1976-1980), and went on to complete a Master of Science in Biology at the University of British Columbia (1992). Barrett- Lennard also gained his doctorate at the University of British Columbia where he studied the role of genetics in the mating systems and population subdivisions of killer whales.  Career  Following the completion of his Ph.D., Barrett-Lennard took a research scientist position with Fisheries and Oceans Canada (formerly DFO) at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, British Columbia where he continued studying the role of genetics in the population structure of killer whale sub-populations. In 2001, he accepted his current role as Director of the Marine Mammal Research Program at the Vancouver Aquarium. The Vancouver Aquarium.  Research  One of many research units at the Vancouver Aquarium, the Marine Mammal Research Program (MMRP) conducts research on Killer Whales, Humpback Whales, Harbour Porpoises, Beluga Whales, Sea Otters, and a host of other marine mammals. A major branch of the MMRP is The B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network, a whale sightings report system that relies heavily on Citizen science. The B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network facilitates the reporting of whale sightings through the WhaleReport mobile app. Details on whale locations are then used by the WhaleReport Alert System to notify nearby vessels of cetaceans in their vicinity and to encourage them to take precautionary or evasive action. Data from the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network is also used to encourage the practice of land- based whale watching. In 2015, the B.C. Cetacean Sightings Network partnered with the Whale Trail, a Seattle-based organization dedicated on identifying potential land-based whale watching sites in the Pacific Northwest. Land-based whale watching is viewed as a zero-impact alternative to traditional boat- based whale watching. As of recent, the WhaleTrail B.C. has identified 39 such sites. In addition, sightings data is available to academic researchers, industry, and NGOs to aid conservation-based research projects. Discoveries involving sightings data include a newly discovered hot spot of Pacific white- sided dolphin in the Howe Sound area in 2010, and the discovery of a feeding ground utilized by Gray whales in Baynes Sound. Drone-captured photo of Southern Resident Killer Whale chasing a Chinook Salmon. (2017)Barrett-Lennard has made significant research contributions relating to the conservation of killer whales. Through DNA analysis, Barrett-Lennard and his colleagues have shown that the killer whale population in the northeastern Pacific ocean is divided into at least nine sympatric sub-populations.His research focuses on evidence of sympatric speciation in killer whale subpopulations inhabiting the northeastern Pacific. His work has shown that killer whale sub-populations vary significantly in their diet, behaviour, and feeding grounds. His work has unveiled wide variability in the diet of killer whale sub-populations. Barrett-Lennard's most cited study showed that the Southern resident killer whale is primarily piscivorous, and 96% of its diet is salmonids . The same study also discovered a distinct preference for mammalian prey by the Southern Transient Killer Whale sub-population. He has also shown that offshore killer whales may prey on Pacific sleeper shark, the first identified observation of the species being targeted as prey .In 2008, Barrett-Lennard's research was used by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife to officially list the Southern Resident Killer Whale as an endangered species Barrett-Lennard's most recent work focuses on the use of drone-based aerial photogrammetry to remotely observe health and body condition of killer whales. His team has showed that images captured by drones can be used to estimate blubber fat reserves and subsequently body condition by analyzing features such as head shape and eyepatch proportions. Barrett-Lennard has also used drones to remotely monitor the respiratory microbiome of killer whales by aerially capturing samples of exhaled breath or \\"blow\\" Drone-captured photo of two Southern Resident Killer Whales. (2015)  Outreach  Barrett-Lennard has been a featured speaker at the annual B.C Marine Mammal Symposium in Vancouver, British Columbia. Barrett-Lennard has also shared his research with CBC Newshttps://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/pacific-white-sided-dolphins- southern-resident-killer-whales-1.5021585 and CTV News. He has also voiced his scientific opinion on the controversial Harbor seal cull and the Trans Mountain Pipeline.

Contents The book is an anthology of thirteen short adventures that use themes, characters or monsters from classic B movie horror films: vampires based on Bela Lugosi's 1931 portrayal of Dracula; werewolves similar to Lon Chaney Jr.'s 1941 Wolf Man; zombies similar to those in George Romero's Dawn of the Dead; cavemen and dinosaurs from 1975's The Land That Time Forgot; gremlins akin to those in 1984's Gremlins; and a killer alien from 1979's Alien. Players are offered a variety of one-shot characters. In keeping with the light-hearted B-movie theme, the usual Sanity check in the Call of Cthulhu rules has been tweaked so that a character who fails a Sanity check, rather than developing psychoses or phobias, instead screams, or falls down in the path of an approaching monster, or faints. Publication history Blood Brothers, a 128-page softcover book, was the first supplement that Chaosium published for Call of Cthulhu. The thirteen adventures were written by Keith Herber, Sam Shirley, Kevin Ross, Gregory W. Detwiler, Ben Monroe, Scott Clegg, Geoff Gillan, Barbara Manui, Chris Adams, Marcus L. Rowland, Tony Hickie, Michael Szymanski, Scott Aniolowski, and Fred Behrendt,. Earl Geier produced the interior art, and cover art was by Lee Gibbons. Two years after publication of Blood Brothers, Chaosium followed up with a sequel, Blood Brothers 2, featuring nine more movie-themed Call of Cthulhu adventures. Reception In the November 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue #175), Allen Varney enjoyed the humour of the product, saying, \\"This supplement highlights a surprising and welcome turn in our hobby: the impish sense of humor in the field's leading horror game... that fine tap dance on the line between horror and comedy.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #25 (Feb./March, 1991) References Category:Call of Cthulhu adventures ","title":"Blood Brothers (Call of Cthulhu)"},{"id":"62201326","text":"The Sinister Man is a 1924 thriller novel by the British writer Edgar Wallace.

Life  She was born to Captain Thomas Ross, a gunner assistant in the Royal Artillery who was badly wounded at the Siege of Seringapatam (now is the territory of India) in 1792, and Isabella Rose MacLeod in Perth, Scotland. Shortly after his father death in 1794, her sister was born and named Isabella Rose, after her mother, and was baptised at St. Mary's Church, Fort St. George (Madraspatnam). Afterwards, the two siblings moved back to Raasay. What happened to her mother remained uncertain, but it was possible that her mother died and was buried on the sea during the voyage home from India. She attended Mary Erskine School in Edinburgh. In 1815, she married Charles D'Oyly and resided in India until 1838, when her husband's sickness forced them to leave the country, then returned to Britain before moving to Italy. The couple also established a lithographic press and the 'Behar School of Athens', a society for artists. After her husband's death in 1845, she moved to Dorset till her death and maintaining her highland heritage.  Work and Manuscript  She started putting interests in arts and music at very young age. It is believed that she had really good ground in music, taking a lively part in domestic music- making. Angus MacKay, the son of John MacKay described her as having a very remarkable taste of music, being fond of P√¨obaireachd, as she managed to play the longest pieces from the performance of the family piper and used to play the pieces in piano with much effect. She started writing the manuscript of Gaelic Music at the age of 23. In 1875, she published Orain Ghaidhlig, a set of four poems which later is included in Oranaiche, an anthology of Gaelic verse. In 2011, the School of Scottish Studies Archives of the University of Edinburgh released \\"The Manuscript of Elizabeth Ross\\", a compilation of Original Highland Airs, collected by her at Raasay in 1812. Later in 2016, The Musica Scotica Trust re-released the compilation.

It is located on the south side of 42nd Street, across from Grand Central Terminal to the north, and between the Pershing Square Building to the west and the Chanin Building to the east. 110 East 42nd Street is named for the Bowery Savings Bank, who had erected the building as a new branch structure to supplement its original Bowery building. 110 East 42nd Street was designed in the Italian Romanesque Revival style by York and Sawyer, with William Louis Ayres as the partner in charge. It was erected within \\"Terminal City\\", a collection of buildings located above the underground tracks surrounding Grand Central, and makes use of real-estate air rights above the tracks. The building is located directly above the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station. 110 East 42nd Street, as well as the adjacent Pershing Square Building, were built on the site of the Grand Union Hotel. Construction started in 1921 and was completed in 1923, and an addition was added between 1931 and 1933. 110 East 42nd Street continues to be used as a bank and office building. Its facade and lobby were made New York City designated landmarks in 1996.  Description  The building was designed in the Italian Romanesque Revival style by the firm of York & Sawyer. The design shares many elements with the Pershing Square Building building directly to the west, which was also co- designed by York & Sawyer. The site is also bounded by the Chanin Building to the east, 42nd Street to the north, and 41st Street to the south. = Form = York and Sawyer's original plans for 110 East 42nd Street called for a four- story-tall banking room, topped by thirteen office floors, to extend the width of the block between 41st and 42nd Streets. A hip-roofed penthouse on top of the office floors would bring the building's height to 18 floors. The building has a frontage of on 42nd Street and extends to the back of the lot at 41st Street. As it was not a freestanding structure, 110 East 42nd Street deviated from traditional bank building designs, including that of the original main branch at Bowery and Grand Street. Most significantly, it did not resemble a \\"modified Greek temple\\" as earlier bank buildings had. The building was instead designed in the Italian Romanesque Revival style, The Italian Romanesque design provided consistency to the facade, since the Pershing Square Building to the west was designed in a similar manner. York & Sawyer's ultimate design emphasized the juxtaposition of office and banking concerns in the building, which are stacked one above the other. = Facade = The 42nd Street archway, showing the large window above the doorway. The architrave runs below the top of the arch. The facade is divided into three vertical sections: the base, tower, and upper stories. The facade contains elements such as arcades, and cornices with corbelling. A variety of materials and colors are used for the building's individual elements, including colonettes made of pink granite; spandrels made of green marble; and a roof with red tiling. The facade elements are also decorated with representations of figures such as \\"birds, beasts, fantastic mythological creatures [and] human forms\\". The 42nd Street facade is largely made of Ohio sandstone. On the 42nd Street side, there are also columns and colonettes made of pink granite; tiled wall copings; and spandrels made of green marble. The 41st Street facade is made of sandstone on the first floor, and buff-colored bonded brick above it. At the bottom of both facades is a water table made of granite, which is higher on the eastern part of the building, due to the area's topography sloping downward to the east.  Base  On the four-story base facing 42nd Street to the north, there is a large round-arched entrance taking up most of the facade, with detailed archivolts running on the underside of the archway. The large ground-floor arch leads to the giant banking room inside. A short flight of stairs leads to a set of doors, above which is a large window that fills the rest of the arch opening. There are voussoirs running along the top of the arch, with a carved motif located within every other voissoir. A pair of rose windows, small circular apertures, are located at the fourth floor flanking the top of the arch. An architectural arcade with arched openings runs along the fifth floor facade. To the west of the main archway (on the right side as seen from 42nd Street), a small arch provides access to the office tower's entrance vestibule, the elevator lobby, and the subway station. The entrance contains a semicircular tympanum above the doorway, with a geometric pattern, as well as embossed surrounds on either side of the doorway. The words \\"The Bowery Savings Bank Building\\" are inscribed on top of the tympanum, and the building's address is fully spelled out on the bottom of the tympanum. Above this archway are two pairs of windows, one each at the third and fourth floors. The third floor includes two rectangular windows and the fourth floor contains two arched grilles in place of window openings. To the east (left) is the six-story \\"Chapel\\" annex completed in 1933. The lower two floors contain a three-arched arcade with two granite columns. The rectangular third-floor windows and arched fourth-floor windows are similar to those on the west side of the facade. Above the first- and second-floor arcade, there are four carved motifs, located at even intervals, as well as an inscription \\"A Mutual Institution Chartered 1834 To Serve Those Who Save\\". There is an architectural arcade running across the 5th story facade. The facade of the base on 41st Street, to the south, is similar in that it also contains a large archivolted arch with a set of doors below a large window. However, the doors on the 41st Street facade are located in a three-faced structure that projects slightly. Flanking the arch are three architectural bays, two to the west (left) and one to the east (right) of the arch. These bays each contain two rectangular windows on the second floor, two arched windows on the third floor, and a rose window on the fourth floor. A driveway leading to an underground parking garage is located on the first floor underneath the leftmost bay.  Tower  On the 42nd Street side above the four-story base, the 5th through 13th floors are articulated with vertical piers and window spandrels. The piers divide the facade into five architectural bays: four bays above the main banking entrance in the center, and one bay above the office-building entrance on the west (right) side. Each bay contains two windows on each floor. Horizontal cornices with corbeling are located above the 14th and 17th floors. There is an architectural arcade running across the 5th story facade, as well as another arcade running across the 15th and 16th stories. The 17th story contains round-arched window openings while the 18th story consists of four windows that each contain three panes. On the 17th floor, at the top of 110 East 42nd Street's tower section, are tiled copings. At the 42nd Street facade, a flagpole extends from the center of the tower section at the fifth floor, directly above the center of the archway. On the 41st Street side, the facade rises nine stories from ground level, with a cornice at the top of this section. Above the ninth floor, the building contains a setback, and the tower rises behind this setback to the 17th story. The 41st Street side is also articulated with vertical piers and window spandrels. It also contains five architectural bays, with each bay containing two windows per floor. = First- floor interior = Interior vault The first floor consists of three sections: an elevator vestibule on the west, a banking room on the center, and the smaller \\"Chapel\\" section to the east.For a diagram of the floor layout, see The massive first-floor banking room measures wide and long with a ceiling. It was described by The New York Times as one of the largest banking rooms in a New York City bank. The banking room utilizes marble, limestone, sandstone and bronze screens to create a space reminiscent of a basilica. The annex and banking rooms use a mixture of materials on the walls and columns: according to the Landmarks Preservation Commission, these include ashlar as well as \\"marble, limestone, sandstone, imitation stone, and plaster\\". Various other motifs also adorn the walls, ceiling, and columns. The banking room can be entered from five places: the main 41st and 42nd Street archways to the south and north, respectively; an entrance to the office building's vestibule to the northeast; and two doorways leading to the passenger- and freight-elevator lobbies to the west. The marble tellers' counter, high, is in the middle of the banking room. The floor is made of marble tile patterns, and a wooden staircase at the northeastern corner of the banking room leads to the basement. The ceiling above the banking room is supported by steel trusses that run across the vault. Six major trusses run perpendicular to the walls and are supported by twelve corbels, while smaller trusses run diagonally between alternating corbels. The ceiling is coated with six layers of materials, giving it the appearance of \\"minor wooden beams and coffering\\". Six chandeliers hang from the ceiling at the locations where the diagonal trusses cross each other. The \\"Chapel\\" annex is located to the east of the banking room's northern section, connected via two large rectangular openings cut through the party wall on the eastern side of the banking room. The design is similar to that of the banking room, with limestone and sandstone walls. A second floor loggia overlooks the northern end of the annex's first floor, and below that is a set of double doors leading to the central arch of the arcade along 42nd Street. Two chandeliers and a painted rhombus pattern are located on the flat ceiling, while a patterned frieze runs near the top of the wall. The space to the west of the main banking room measures wide and long. It includes an entrance vestibule, as well as a lobby containing passenger and freight elevators. The vestibule, located to the north and facing 42nd Street, contains a ceiling with three vaults. It includes a staircase to the New York City Subway's Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station, serving the , along its western side. To the south is the elevator lobby, which contains decorative floor tiling and six painted ceiling vaults, similar in design to the main banking room. The elevator doors contain bronze panels with various embossed motifs.  History  = Site = The completion of the underground Grand Central Terminal in 1913 resulted in the rapid development of the areas around Grand Central, and a corresponding increase in real-estate prices. Among these were the New York Central Building at 47th Street and Park Avenue, as well as the Grand Central Palace across 42nd Street from the present 110 East 42nd Street. By 1920, the area had become what The New York Times called \\"a great civic centre\\". In 1913, the Dual Contracts were signed by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), two companies who operated parts of the present New York City Subway. A set of platforms at Grand Central, now serving the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (), was to be built diagonally under the building site as part of the agreement. At the time, the site under the proposed station was occupied by Grand Union Hotel, which was condemned via eminent domain in February 1914. The condemnation proceedings for the hotel cost $3.5 million (equal to $ million in ). To pay the station's construction cost, the Public Service Commission approved the construction of a 25-story building above the station. By May 1915, the building site had been excavated for the construction of the building. Despite the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required architectural setbacks to provide light to the streets below, the building plans conformed with the older zoning codes, which did not require setbacks. Though the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 42nd Street station opened in 1918, the site above the station was not developed as planned. The Transit Commission attempted to sell the building site in May 1920 for $2.8 million (equal to $ million in ), but no one placed a bid. Then in July 1920, a realty consortium headed by investor Henry Mandel offered $2.9 million for the hotel (equal to $ million in ), a proposal that was accepted. The value of the land at the future building site was extremely valuable; by 1923, the Rider's Guide to New York City referred to the blocks of East 42nd Street between Park and Fifth Avenues as \\"Little Wall Street\\". = Planning and construction = The Bowery Savings Bank, then located at the Bowery and Grand Street in lower Manhattan, was among the parties who were seeking to add an uptown location, and in September 1920 its trustees unanimously agreed to look for an uptown site. The trustees soon found a site on 42nd Street, but a standalone bank building could not be built there, as it was deemed too costly. As such, the bank trustees created a building committee to start planning for the building in December 1920. 110 East 42nd Street (left) and the Pershing Square Building (right) share what was believed to be New York City's tallest party wall In January 1921, Mandel sold the Bowery Savings Bank the eastern half of the Grand Union Hotel site, which would be developed into an office building called 110 East 42nd Street. As per the purchase agreement between the bank and the corporation, the structures were to contain interlocking structures, including what was believed to be the city's tallest party wall separating two buildings. York and Sawyer, designers of several bank buildings in the eastern United States, had been hired to devise plans for the new Savings Bank at the site of the Grand Union Hotel. The lead architect on the project was William Louis Ayres. The plans were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in April 1921. Excavations had started in February 1921 in advance of the plans' approval, and that June, the building committee recommended to start construction immediately. Construction on the building officially commenced that July with a groundbreaking ceremony. By the time the new branch opened in 1923, there were 155,000 people with accounts at the Bowery Savings Bank. The bank had had seen $1.5 million in deposits () \\"on one day recently\\", compared to the $2,020 deposited on the original branch's opening day in 1834 (). Just prior to 110 East 42nd's opening in June 1923, $202 million of deposits held by the Bowery Savings Bank (equal to $ billion in ) was moved from the original branch to the new branch, using 14 armored cars guarded by 100 heavily armed policemen. However, the bank retained its original offices on Bowery. Upon the opening of 110 East 42nd, the branch had total deposits of $177 million (equal to $ billion in ). There were 2,500 new accounts opened at the 110 East 42nd branch on the first day in office, and 33,803 new accounts in the nine months afterward, with total deposits at the 110 East 42nd branch increasing by $25 million in that time period (equal to $ million in ). The presence of the new Bowery Savings Bank branch and of brokerage firms on 42nd Street bolstered its reputation as a \\"Little Wall Street\\". Some alterations were made to the main building in 1927, including the installation of a clock, bronze display cases, and revolving doors outside the 42nd Street entrance. A six-story addition to the east, which came to be called \\"The Chapel\\", was proposed in March 1931. Louis Ayres designed the addition while Marc Eidlitz & Son, Inc. erected the structure. The Chapel annex was completed by 1933. = Later use = Office tower entrance, subway stairs to the right The fifth floor facade's marble colonettes were replaced with granite ones in 1951, and the annex's windows and entrance were redesigned in 1956. A plaque was erected outside 110 East 42nd Street in 1957, designating it as a point of interest and an unofficial \\"landmark\\". The screen above the 42nd Street archway were replaced with a glass window in 1962. A year after the Bowery Savings Bank was acquired by H. F. Ahmanson & Co. in 1991, the building's ownership was jointly transferred to Ahmanson and a limited partnership, who owned the building as a condominium. Greenpoint Bank took over the banking spaces in 1995, after having bought many of Ahmanson's branches. The building was designated an official New York City landmark in 1996. SL Green bought the building in March 1998 and subsequently renovated the lobby as well as replaced the elevators. The ground-floor banking room was converted to a Cipriani restaurant and upscale event space, with Cipriani finalizing the deal for the new location in January 1999. At the same time, with the renovation and revival of Grand Central in the late 1990s, large tenants began occupying 110 East 42nd's office space. The areas immediately surrounding Grand Central, including 110 East 42nd, had of air rights above the terminal and its rail yards. This allowed for the construction of developments with that maximum floor area above Grand Central. In 2014, some of 110 East 42nd's unused air rights were passed to One Vanderbilt, a skyscraper being built a block to the west.  Critical reception  The fifth edition of the AIA Guide to New York City referred to 110 East 42nd Street as \\"one of the great spaces of New York.\\" According to a 1928 piece in Architectural Forum magazine, the building was ‚Äúa castle in the clouds brought to earth, and the ticket of admission is only a stiff little deposit book.‚Äù A 1986 article in the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail said that 110 East 42nd Street \\"flaunts the power of New York money.

It was created by writer Tom Taylor and the artistic team including penciler Trevor Hairsine and inker Stefano Guadiano. The story takes place in an alternate Earth, where a corrupted version of the Anti-Life Equation has infected most of Earth's inhabitants with a zombie-like virus. Lois Lane acts as the series' narrator, detailing how the events took place over the course of a few weeks.  Publication history  A routinely strong performer, the first issue was released in May 2019, and was ranked #1 in the comic book sales for that period.

He is being tortured by DeSaad, who reveals that the Anti-Life Equation has been living in his cybernetic body. In order for Cyborg to survive the extraction, the Black Racer is summoned. However, this causes the Equation to become corrupted, and Cyborg is sent back to Earth in order to prevent the virus from spreading. This action comes too late, however, as Darkseid is driven mad by the corruption and throws himself into Apokolips' core, destroying himself and the planet in the process. Cyborg is sent to Metropolis, where the virus latches onto the internet and begins to infect people with a techno-organic viral version of the Equation. This causes people to suffer violent transformations, turning them into a zombie-like state. Superman is reunited with Lois Lane, his son Jonathan and a visiting Damian Wayne, destroying all the screens in their apartment to prevent infection. In the Batcave, the Batcomputer's firewall prevents Bruce from becoming infected, but is too late to stop the infection of both Nightwing and Red Robin who fight Batman while he tells Alfred Pennyworth to run. In the Atlantic Ocean, Aquaman is swarmed by a mob and infected. In Metropolis, Lois Lane creates a safe haven on the Daily Planet's rooftop. While in Gotham, Harley Quinn unknowingly confronts an infected Joker. In the middle of a camping trip, Hal Jordan is infected by the virus after looking at his phone, leaving Oliver Queen and Dinah Drake to fend him off. After being killed via Drake's Canary Cry, she is chosen to become the new Green Lantern before Superman brings them both to the Daily Planet. Damian makes contact with his father, who has killed both of his former sidekicks and become infected. Using one of Mr. Freeze's suits to slow down the transformation, he tells his friends everything he has found out. He begins to turn, and is killed by Alfred. Alfred pilots the Batplane into Gotham City and shoots at the infected below. Harley Quinn, while fleeing, kills the Joker. Before escaping, she is confronted by the infected Birds of Prey. In Atlantis, Mera and Tempest are interrupted by the infected Aquaman and his army of sea creatures. While Mera escapes, Tempest is infected. In Metropolis, Superman saves most of the Daily Planet staff, before leaving Green Arrow and Dinah to protect his family. Arriving back in Smallville, he finds that Martha is safe and flies her back to Metropolis, but is forced to leave his infected father behind. In Washington D.C., Captain Atom has begun to purge the infected from the streets, on orders from Amanda Waller but is unaware that an infected Ray Palmer is inside his body. In Gotham, Poison Ivy kills the Birds of Prey before they can infect Quinn. In Metropolis, Superman and Dinah take to the streets to find other survivors, while Lois begins to broadcast a message via analog forms of communication. An infected Giganta has laid siege to the Daily Planet, only to be knocked down by Superman. Wonder Woman arrives and argues with Superman whether or not to kill the infected. Before they can agree, Giganta's head is blasted open by Cyborg. Back on the rooftop, Alfred arrives giving Damian a Batsuit. Cyborg then reveals the true nature of the infected, they are merely an extension of the Anti-Life Equation. Suddenly, Hawkgirl plummets from the sky. She informs Superman that Captain Atom is about to self-implode. Clark and Wonder Woman grab Atom, and proceed to fly him into the upper atmosphere but they are too late and he explodes, wiping out a number of major cities including Metropolis with the only survivors saved by Dinah's Ring shield. Superman and Wonder Woman have also survived and are approached by Lex Luthor, offering a truce with the heroes. A week later, Gotham has become a jungle ruled by Ivy and Quinn. Within a few more weeks the internet is disabled across the world, and safe havens are set up in Gotham, Themyscira and the Fortress of Solitude. While Luthor and Cyborg insist that the planet be abandoned using the newly built Arks, Superman is adamant about not leaving. The heroes are blindsided by the infected Martian Manhunter, who kills Luthor and infects The Flash. Superman faces the infected Flash head on while he runs, he kills the Flash but becomes infected. Leaving for space to kill himself, before he can deprive himself of oxygen he begins to transform. As the infected Superman rampages, the evacuation to the Arks begins.

During the evacuation of Themyscira, Aquaman re-emerges from the ocean with a Kraken and his infected army, only to be killed by Green Arrow. Wonder Woman, Dinah and Cyborg face off against Superman. While they seem to get the upper hand, Superman mortally wounds Diana before flying into space to destroy the Arks. Jonathan faces off against his father and collides with him, knocking himself out.

Either solo or with Michael Galinsky, she has directed low-budget fictional narratives but has mostly concentrated on documentaries in recent years. Early Life and Education Hawley is a native of Dallas, Texas, where she was born in 1969. In her youth, she enjoyed playing video games. She has referred to her interest in filmmaking as an extension of her early interest in video games. ‚ÄúThey involve the same skills ‚Äì rhythm, pushing buttons, fast thinking to solve problems.‚Äù Hawley attended The Hockaday School in Dallas where she began video editing in high school. ‚ÄúI knew I was hooked, so I chose a school that had a strong film department and took as many film classes as I could, both theory and production ‚Äì probably more classes just watching movies. The school I chose had a heavy bent toward the old Hollywood Classics ‚Äì comedy, noir, dramas.‚Äù That school was Wesleyan University where Hawley studied under the tutelage of film historian Jeanine Basinger. Career After graduating from college, Hawley moved to Los Angeles where she worked as an assistant editor in the cutting room of Roger Corman‚Äôs Venice studio. In 1992 and ‚Äô93, she worked at the Sundance Film Festival in the box office and as a director of housing at the 1992 Summer Director and Screenwriters Labs. Moving to New York to attend film school, Hawley worked as an intern in the office of Christine Vachon and Todd Haynes‚Äô company Apparatus Films. She was assistant to the director Daisy von Scherler Mayer on the production of the indie film Party Girl (1995 film). It was at a lunch break on set one day that Galinsky ‚Äútalked her into dropping out [of film school] so that [they] could make a film instead.‚Äù Hawley has been making films with Michael Galinsky since 1994. Their first two films, Half- Cocked (film) (1994) and Radiation (1999), were narrative features. They were followed by the documentary Horns and Halos (2002), which they made in partnership with David Beilinson. Soon after, they formed Rumur, a collaborative production studio. Hawley served as co-director and editor of Half-Cocked (film) (1994), Radiation (1999), Lee Hazlewood in New York (2001), Horns and Halos (film) (2002), Code 33 (2005), Miami Manhunt (2008), Battle for Brooklyn (2011), Who Took Johnny (2013), 30 for 30 Shorts: The Sweat Solution (2015), All the Rage: Saved by Sarno (2016), Working in Protest(2017), and The Commons (2019). She served as an editor on American Cannibal: The Road to Reality (2006), and co-producer on Trouble on the Corner (1997). She received a writing credit on Half-Cocked (1994) and Radiation (1999). Hawley's and Galinsky's films have screened at scores of festivals around the world, including South by Southwest, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Toronto International Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival, Slamdance, and the New York Underground Film Festival. Their film Who Took Johnny (2014) was included in Artforum International‚Äôs annual top 10 by John Waters who called it ‚ÄúAn amazing, lunatic head-scratcher of a documentary about missing children with plot twists that will leave you creeped out, surprised, and excited. As good as Capturing the Friedmans!\\" Mr. Waters also invited the film to screen at The 60th Thessaloniki Film Festival in a special program of his 10 favorite films. Two of their films have been on the Academy Award shortlist for Best Documentary Feature, Battle For Brooklyn in 2011 and Horns and Halos in 2003 Since 2017, Suki has been a programmer on the Narrative Feature Programming Committee at the Slamdance Film Festival.

With her husband Eli, she has collected \\"about 2000 pieces of art valued at more than $2 billion\\" and supported arts initiatives such as the Los Angeles Opera and The Broad.  Early life  Born in Detroit to a homemaker and chemist, Edythe Lawson attended public school and particularly enjoyed school trips to the Detroit Institute of Arts. Early artworks of importance to her include John Singleton Copley's Watson and the Shark, and Picasso's Three Musicians. When Lawson was a teenager, she met Eli Broad, who proposed to her after a few dates. They married in 1954. Her father gave her husband and her cousin the money to start his first company, and the couple became significantly wealthy through this and subsequent businesses. They had two sons, Jeffrey and Gary.  Philanthropy and arts patronage  = Collecting = In 1963, Broad and her family moved to Los Angeles. Broad took walks in the evenings through the galleries on La Cienega Boulevard and began acquiring works by Southern California artists. She met Taft Schreiber and through him encountered art dealers in New York. In 1972, Broad and her husband purchased a Van Gogh drawing entitled Cabanes a Saintes-Maries, 1888, for $95,000. Broad's husband Eli became increasingly involved in collecting and they increasingly concentrated their focus on postwar and contemporary art. They traded the Van Gogh in a deal to acquire a work by Robert Rauschenberg. Broad was friends with various contemporary artists in the 1970s. Lichtenstein gifted her his Brushstroke Chair and Ottoman sculptures after she admired them in his studio, and Broad and Dorothy Lichtenstein did yoga together. Today, Broad particularly appreciates the works of Jeff Koons. Several of his works are exhibited at The Broad. Broad and her husband have financially supported various collections and art museums. In 2008, The Broad Foundation gave $30 million to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, on the condition that it not merge with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Broad and her husband separately supported that organisation, which they endowed a $56-million building in 2003. Broad also has a collection of pre- Columban gold jewellery.

The Broads signed onto The Giving Pledge, a commitment for wealthy individuals to give at least half of their wealth to charity, in 2010 when they founded the museum. They committed to giving 75% of their wealth away. Broad and her husband have supported educational causes via The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation, whose stated mission is to expand learning opportunities to students from underserved communities so they can reach their full potential. The Broads have also donated a significant sum to higher education organisations, including Michigan State University (MSU), where Eli studied. They donated $28 million for the construction of the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid. The museum opened in November 2012. In 2014, The Broad Foundation announced a further $5 million gift to the Broad Art Museum at MSU to support exhibitions. Broad and her husband also contribute significant amounts towards scientific and medical research via the Broad Foundation. In 2003, they gave a $100 million founding gift to create the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, which was to focus on genomics research. They subsequently gave $100 million in 2004, and then $400 million in 2009 in order to make the institute an independent nonprofit. In 2013, the Broads gifted another $100 million to the organisation. A public-private partnership between the voter-created California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, the Keck School of Medicine of USC and The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation (which donated $30 million in 2006) resulted in the creation of The Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the University of Southern California (USC). In 2007, the Broads contributed $20 million to the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Then, in 2008, they gave a major gift to the University of California, San Francisco for the new headquarters of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, which opened in February 2011.

Personal life  Cicely Ethel Wilkinson (n√©e Cardwell) was born in Eastbourne, Sussex on 5 June 1882/1883 to Colonel William Alexander Cardwell and Lilian Cardwell (n√©e Brodie). Wilkinson's 1939 register booklet lists her date of birth as 5 June 1882 but her marriage certificate suggests she was born in 1883/1884 (probably 1883); furthermore, her aviation certificate gives her date of birth as 5 June 1888. On 12 October 1903 and aged 20, Wilkinson married Henry Edward Thornton Wilkinson (1874-1942). In 1911, Wilkinson and her husband were living in Malton, Yorkshire, where their occupation in the 1911 census was described as \\"private means.\\" In 1919, Wilkinson petitioned the British Divorce Court for the restitution of her conjugal rights with her husband; they were still living together in 1939.  First World War  Between April and October 1915, Wilkinson served as a chauffeur for the British Committee of the French Red Cross and may also have served as an ambulance driver on the Western Front. On 11 September 1916, Wilkinson qualified as a pilot in a Caudron biplane at the Beatty School at Hendon Aerodrome for which she received Royal Aero Club Aviator Certificate number 3522. She was possibly the only woman to qualify as a pilot in Britain during the First World War. In 1918, she wrote Pers libres poems, published by New Line Press. After the war, Wilkinson was awarded the British War Medal and British Victory Medal in recognition of her wartime service. Cicely's brother Hugh Brodie Cardwell, a Captain in the Royal Field Artillery, was killed in action on 9 August 1918 and is buried at St. Sever Cemetery, Rouen.  Later life  Wilkinson's wartime interest in automobiles continued into peacetime. Between 1937 and 1938, \\"the intrepid Mrs Wilkinson\\" was the owner of an Aston Martin 2.0-Litre 15/98 Tourer, sold to her by Lancelot Prideaux-Brune.

In Azerbaijan, this culture was studied on the basis of archeological materials from the I Kultepe, II Kultepe, Shahtakhti, Gizilburun, Nahjir, Shortepe, Garachuk, II Gazanchi qala and other monuments. The painted pottery culture was studied by Azerbaijani archaeologists such as O. Habibullayev, V. Bakhshaliyev, V. Aliyev and A. Akbarov. According to V. Bakhshaliyev, the formation of this culture dishes in Nakhchivan was connected with the formation of the city states. Painted vessel. Shakhtakhti Recent researches suggested that the painted pottery culture of Nakhchivan was the result of the natural development of the Kur-Araz culture.  History  First time in Azerbaijan the samples of painted pottery culture were discovered in the territory of Nakhchivan in 1895. In the result of the land work around Kizilveng cemetery located 18 km away from Nakhchivan, 3 km south of Tazakand, on the left bank of the Araz River, several historical items, including simple and painted dishes were revealed from the stone box graves. Captain N. Fyodorov conducted excavations on behalf of the Archeological Commission in Nakchivan where he found burials with painted pottery dated to the end of the 2nd millennium BC. A relatively extensive study of the painted culture in Azerbaijan was made possible during the Soviet period. In 1926, the Kƒ±zƒ±lvenk cemetery was investigated by the Trans-Caucasian Sciences Association under the leadership of A. Miller in Nakhchivan. In 1934, several painted dishes were found near the Shortepe settlement in Sharur. Excavations continued in the 1960s, painted pottery of Kultepe II, as well as Guruchay and Kondelenchay river basins were investigated. Scraps of painted dishes were found in Karakopektepe. Polychrome vessel. I Kultepe  Characteristics  Archaeologists divided this culture chronologically into four periods: * XX- XVII centuries BC - simple pottery samples partially polished, monochrome painted (mainly black and gray ), neatly decorated with simple geometric shapes or with human, animal, bird patterns; found from Shortepe, Kultepe I, Kultepe II, Uzerliktepe. Jugs, bowls, goblets. * XVII-XV centuries BC - Polychrome painted vessels decorated with complex geometric shapes, finely decorated with human, animal and bird patterns, Jug and bowl shaped pottery. Gizilveng (Dancing couple illustrated on the pottery) * XIV-XI centuries BC- Monochrome and polychrome painted, relatively inaccurately decorated with human, animal and bird patterns, geometric figures. Vases, ellipsoid bowls, jugs, plates, kettle-like pottery * X-VII centuries BC- More rigid and simplistic geometric patterns dyed in only red color.  Material remains  Painted vessel from II Kultepe Painted pots came across in the ceramics of Nakhchivan's Kur-Araz culture. In general, red on clay pots have been found in Azerbaijan since the Eneolithic period. Except a group of painted pots, the rest of them didn't differ from other eneolithic group pots by their clay content or the technology of preparation. In 1936, painted vessels belong to the Middle Bronze Age, were obtained from the second layer of the Shortepe settlement. Monochrome painted ceramic patterns were discovered from the Dize necropolis. Monochrome painted pots dated to the III-II milleniums BC were mostly encountered in Yayjƒ± necropolis in Nakhchivan. A wide range of animal drawings were illustrated on the monochrome painted long-necked jugs. In 1951, the archeological expedition organized by the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR under the leadership of O.Habibullayev conducted researchs in the Kultepe I and found painted dishes here. There were both monochrome and polychrome type clay vessels discovered in Kultepe II. The red colored pots found on the upper layers of II Kultepe were identical to the materials of the I and II Makhta residential areas. The painted pottery remains found in Uzerliktepe (Aghdam) were divided into two groups. While the first group was light red, resembles Kizilveng type painted dishes and featuring geometric and zoomorphic figures, the second group was polished. In addition to stamped black and gray decorations, there were also monochrome type dishes in Karak√∂pektepe region. In 2008, the study conducted by Nakhchivan branch of the ANAS and Georgian University of the USA under the leadership of V. Bakhshaliyev identified that the painted pots found in the Oghlanqala settlement belonged to the Iron Age.  Relations with other cultures  Encountering similar painted vessel patterns of Nakhchivan were found in the Van and Urmia Lake basin, northeastern Anatolia, and the Mil- Mugan plains around Goyche indicates that these regions shared a mutual culture. There were many common features among polychrome pottery from Kultepe II and pottery remains from the Urmia monuments of HaftavƒÅn-Tepe and Geoy- Tepe. The painted ceramics found in Kultepe I had a similarity to the materials of the Halaf culture. Researchers assumed that the population were linked to the south, to Mesopotamia. The Middle Chalcolithic painted bowl found in the Shortepe also reminisced the Halaf and Ubaid traditions because of influence of these culture. Drawings descripted on the Nakhchivan's painted pottery symbolized worship tradition (Lullubi tribes). The 8 corners star drawing on a pot found in the Nehecir necropolis was similar to the star description on the Victory Monument of the Lullubi ruler Anubani. There were many similarities between the dress of the goddess depicted on Anubani's Victory Monument and the woman's dress on the Kƒ±zƒ±lburun painted pitcher.

The association started out as four departments in London, Manchester and Edinburgh and it took students or trainee/assistants during the 1940s and 1950s. By 1962 the association had started its own postgraduate programme to train graduate artists. In 1989, forty years after its foundation, the association received the patronage of the Worshipful Company of Barbers, one of the City of London livery companies,and by the same year students were able to register at a medical school within London University to take a university diploma course. A year later in 1990, the Association became a limited company continuing to train artists looking for a career in medical illustration. In the 1996, the Association received the Charlotte Holt Bequest created by medical artist Charlotte Holt for the express purpose of training medical artists. This led to the establishment of the Medical Artists' Education Trust (MAEST), a charitable organisation tasked with managing the Association's specialist Postgraduate Training Programme. Today, the Association is the professional body for Medical Artists in the UK with its members possessing specialist skills in art and a deep, if not professional, understanding of medical procedures specifically, but not exclusively, in the area of surgery.

First photo of Sam Clemens's cave signature Discovery of Clemens Signature in Mark Twain Cave Lovell made news around the world when she discovered the long-sought boyhood signature of Samuel Langhorne Clemens on July 26, 2019 inside the Mark Twain Cave in Hannibal, Missouri where Clemens lived from the age of 4 to 17. She had looked for the signature for decades and discovered it during a special tour with fellow Twain scholars during the quadrennial Clemens Conference hosted by the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum. Lovell and cave owner Linda Coleberd did not announce the discovery until experts had the opportunity to examine it. The signature was authenticated as belonging to Samuel Clemens by Twain scholars Alan Gribben and Kevin Mac Donnell after comparing signatures of Sam Clemens and his siblings from the time period the Clemens family lived in Hannibal. Lovell's first significant Twain discovery came during a visit to the Bermuda National Trust when she found an unsigned manuscript detailing the first time Clemens witnessed a cricket match tucked inside a scrapbook. The essay had been published in The Strand after Twain's death, but the whereabouts of the original manuscript were unknown. The manuscript was later exhibited at Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art.

The center was located in the Biltmore Hotel at 41 Park Avenue in New York City. It closed in 1940, but the efforts made to establish a center to collect records encouraged several colleges and universities to begin develop similar archives of women's history. It was one of the earliest efforts to collect women's documents in the United States, predated the first accredited women's studies course in the U.S by 34 years, and preserved materials about women which otherwise might have been lost. It also redefined the way that historical documents were selected for archival inclusion. By changing what documents were noteworthy, using personal records to shape public history, the Women's Archive legacy was foundational to the development of feminist theory. Establishment In 1935, Rosika Schwimmer, a pacifist suffragist, proposed to historian Mary Ritter Beard an idea to establish an archive to preserve the records of influential women. In Schwimmer's letter to Beard, she expressed her desire to create a repository for her personal archives, as well as leaders in the feminist and pacifist movements. Lamenting the lack of scholarship on women's history, she noted that while some noted women's records had been preserved, they were scattered, making it difficult to create an accurate or complete accounting of historic people and events. She also was concerned that the conservative environment which emerged in the interwar period would suppress gains made in the Progressive Era. Evaluating the state of feminism in the 1930s, Beard had concluded that greed and destructive tendencies had led to the Great Depression and that the equality sought by some feminists was merely \\"equality in disaster\\". She thought that women should focus on new ideas which would create a better society. She believed that a knowledge of the roles women had played throughout history could help women forge new leadership paths without imitating systems with subjugated them. Upon receipt of Schwimmer's letter, Beard immediately understood the educational value of such an archive, which would allow academics and other women to study women, rather than focusing solely on the achievements of men. On September 17, 1935, Beard; Geline MacDonald Bowman, president of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs; Mary Jobson; Kathryn McHale, president of the American Association of University Women; and Lena Madesin Phillips, founder of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women, sent out a letter hoping to secure sponsors for the development of the archive and announced that a conference to discuss organization would be held the following month. The letter was sent to women such as Pearl S. Buck, Anne Morgan, Alice Paul, and Eleanor Roosevelt, including women from a variety of occupations as well as political viewpoints. The first meeting of the board was held in New York City on October 15, 1935, and early in 1936, the archive was incorporated with Inez Haynes Irwin as chair; banker Mina Bruere, as Treasurer; and Jane Norman Smith and Phillips on the Executive committee. In March 1936, Schwimmer, who had mainly worked in the background because of negative publicity surrounding her, resigned from the project for unspecified reasons. Operation The goal of the organization was to establish branches in every state and represent women in all their diversity. Beard hoped that the archives would serve as a springboard for research on women and their history, though she recognized that a research-based center for women's studies would be a future expansion. To that end, she wrote to Ellen Sullivan Woodward, who instructed Works Progress Administration employees to search for records on women and Dorothy B. Porter, librarian and curator at Howard University, who agreed to compile African American records. Beard established the motto \\"No documents, no history\\", originally penned by French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, for the archive. Beard was convinced that it only appeared that women were passive actors throughout history because there were no records showing that they had always been involved in defining civilization. She and supporters who created the Women's Archive aimed to integrate women and their achievements into the historical record, and remove the label of \\"mundane\\" or \\"insignificant\\" from the study of social history. Schwimmer and Beard also recognized that the process of selecting materials reinforced biases by suppressing some materials in favor of others or using political motivation to shape records retention. Beard specifically chose to involve as diverse a community of women as possible to collect records which might provide a complete history. The archive headquarters was located in the Biltmore Hotel at 41 Park Avenue in New York City. The bylaws of the organization established that women contributing records be members of a local affiliated archive branch. Memos to women and published widely in the press reiterated that as libraries and archives had failed to preserve women's history, local groups should take charge of gathering their own records. Schwimmer had first described this problem, noting that Aletta Jacobs' collection had been untouched and unavailable to researchers since it was acquired by the John Crerar Library nearly three decades prior. The pleas for collection also reminded contributors that though women often preserved the memorabilia of male relatives, they often destroyed their own records and letters, which perpetuated the incomplete historical record. To encourage broad participation, they also used the innovative technique of sending out questionnaires, creating oral history narratives, and suggested that new technologies like \\"microfilm\\" be used to allow for broad reproduction and consultation of materials. Initial efforts to raise funds resulted in women such as Irwin, Fannie Hurst, Georgia O'Keeffe, Alice Paul, and Eleanor Roosevelt sponsoring the archive, as well as other prominent women, like Frances Perkins, endorsing the project. Other supporters included Helen Astor, Dorothy Canfield Fisher, Margaret Sanger, and Ida Tarbell. On December 15, 1937, the opening gala was held and featured an exhibit including materials used by Amelia Earhart on her last flight. They later hosted events at the Library of Congress and the National Archives, as well as planning events for organizations like the Camp Fire Girls of America and lectures at universities throughout the country. In 1939, a gala event was hosted in Washington, D. C. by Roosevelt and the Archives featuring some of the papers of Nellie Tayloe Ross, 14th governor of Wyoming. Over 1,500 were in attendance to view the exhibition. In 1938, Margaret Cuthbert, pioneer radio woman and head of the women's division at NBC Radio, pitched the idea that the Women's Archives could sponsor radio programs about women in history. Beard agreed to collaborate on the project believing it would bring more knowledge about women's diverse contributions to history, as long as the credits recognized the involvement of the Women's Archives. The two programs developed, Women in the Making of America and Gallant American Women ran weekly throughout 1939 and 1940. Journalist Eva vom Baur Hansl, a member of the Women's Archives and writer for such newspapers as The New York Times and New-York Tribune, developed the plotlines and then sent drafts to Beard and scriptwriter Jane Ashman for development. The team also consulted with J. Morrice Jones and Irve Tunick from the Office of Education and others like suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt; Eleanor Flexner, a woman's historian; and Eugenie Leonard, prior dean of women at Syracuse University. Dissolution From the beginning because Beard wanted to include diverse viewpoints, some suffragists refused to donate their records. Those from more conservative branches of the movement, like the former National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), which had become the League of Women Voters, suspected ties between Beard and the National Woman's Party (NWP). Catt (NAWSA) refused to donate her papers, but Alice Stone Blackwell (NAWSA) reluctantly supported the effort by donating editions of Woman's Journal by her mother, Lucy Stone. Segregation also caused divides because black women like, Mary Bethune, Elizabeth Carter Brooks, Mary Church Terrell, and Sue Bailey Thurman were barred from joining the \\"whites-only\\" Washington, D. C. branch, in spite of the women having specifically been asked to assist in the project by Porter. Rather than tackle racism outright, Beard simply allowed African American women to submit documents directly to her. That policy brought concerns from other factions, like Miriam Y. Holden (NWP), a scholar and collector, who worked for social justice with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who wanted a direct confrontation on the issue of racism. Coupled with financial issues, the discord and focus on other issues after the entry of the United States into World War II led Beard to resign in June 1940. The archives permanently closed in September because of the difficulties in raising charitable contributions not related to the war efforts. Legacy The records the Women's Archives had accumulated were dispersed widely. Some were returned to their donors upon request, others were donated to various libraries, such as Columbia Teacher's College, Connecticut College, Hunter College, the New York Public Library, and Purdue University. Still others became the foundational documents for women's collections at Barnard College, Smith College's Sophia Smith Collection, and Radcliffe College's Schlesinger Library. Through the efforts to collect documentation, the Women's Archives inspired other individual and institutional efforts to preserve documents about women and their history, which might have disappeared without the collective initiative. It was one of the earliest attempts in the United States to gather women's archival records and predated the development of the first accredited women's studies program in the United States by 34 years. It not only established protocols that collecting women's archives were valuable in shaping the historical narrative, but laid the \\"foundations of the feminist historiographical paradigm\\" and more generally of other marginalized communities. By redefining what materials constituted historical documents, through the inclusion of personal letters, journals, and other memorabilia, the Women's Archives recognized the value of and impact that personal records and oral histories had on public history. That vision influenced how contemporary archives are compiled, as did the focus on having broad accessibility to encourage scholarship.

Some sources describe him as a student of al-Maturidi (d. 333/944-45) in fiqh and kalam. He was proficient in kalam and authored a Hanafi creedal statement that insists on the need for obedience to any duly appointed ruler. The creed criticizes the harsh asceticism of the Karramiyya and accepts traditional views of saintly marvels (karamat). Abu al-Qasim's life marked a turning-point in the formation of the ascetic doctrines and teachings of Hanafi Sunnis in the east, and his al-Sawad al-A'zam () was for a long time a major reference source on doctrine for many Hanafis-Maturidis. Although it is not yet clear whether al-Hakim was a disciple of al-Maturidi, or whether his handbook was a mere traditional document on Hanafite doctrine.  Name  Abu al-Qasim Ishaq b. Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Ibrahim b. Zayd al- Hakim al-Samarqandi.  Birth  His exact date of birth is unknown, although some modern biographers place the date to sometime around 260/874.  Life  Little is known about his life. He lived from the end of the 3rd/9th to the first half of the 4th/10th century.  Death  He died in Samarkand and was buried at Jakardiza (), a place reserved for prominent scholars and persons of nobility. The date of his death is uncertain, some placing it in 340 AH, others in 342 AH, and others in 345 AH. And it was being said in 402 AH. Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi (d. 508/1114) has praised him in his book Tabsirat al- Adilla, and according to him, the date of his death was 335 AH.

Contents The Book of Crafts is a 144-page softcover book designed by Aaron Anderson, Phil Brucato, James Estes, Looking Eagle, Deena McKinney, Wade Racine, Andrew Ragland, Derek Pearcy, Kathleen Ryan, and Lucien Soulban, with interior artwork by James Daly, Pia Guerra, Anthony Hightower, Mark Jackson, Robert Macneil, Shea Anton Pensa, Alex Sheikman, and Ron Spencer, and cover art by Ash Arnett and Matt Milberger. This is a book of eight alternative Crafts ‚Äî organizations for mages ‚Äî for players who do not want their character to belong to one of the establishment Crafts outlined in the original Mage rulebook. They include: * Wu-Keng and Wu-Lung of China * Hem-Ka Sobk of Egypt * Amazonian Sisters of Hippolyta * the fallen Solificati, now known as the Children of Knowledge * a sect within the Templars * Kopea Loei of Hawaii * Bata'a The history, culture, beliefs, organization, practices, traditions and magical style of each Craft are detailed. In addition, a variety of spells developed by each Craft is documented. Reception In the December 1996 edition of Arcane (Issue 14), Adam Tinworth liked the book, saying that the new Crafts \\"are thoughtfully, deeply and, most of all, readably covered.\\" Timworth thought the book had \\"a multitude of potential uses in a Mage game.\\" However, he pointed out that \\" to make the most of this book, as with many other recent Mage releases, you're going to need several other sourcebooks.\\" He concluded by giving the book an above average score of 8 out 10, saying, \\"In a game as dominated by idea and cultural belief as Mage, a book this rich in both is invaluable. While none of the Crafts are as easy to use as those presented in the main rules, for an experienced Mage group this is a pretty essential purchase\\" In the September 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue #239), Rick Swan liked the book, giving it an above average rating of 5 out of 6, and saying \\"Mage aficionados should find The Book of Crafts a delight; the factions described here are more appealing ‚Äî and more gruesome ‚Äî than those in the Mage rulebook.

As a juvenile in 2018 he showed promise by winning his first race and then running third in the Kyoto Nisai Stakes. In the following year he won on his seasonal debut and finished second on his next appearance before being sidelined by injury. He returned in the autumn to run second in the Kobe Shimbun Hai before winning the Kikuka Sho. Background World Premiere is a dark bay or brown colt bred in Hokkaido by Northern Farm. As a foal in 2016 he was consigned to the JRA Select Sale and was bought for ¬•259.2 million by Ryoichi Otsuka. The colt was sent into training with Yasuo Tomomichi. He was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. World Premiere's dam Mandela showed considerable racing ability, winning the Diana-Trial and finishing third in both the Preis der Diana and the Prix de Pomone, and was exported to Japan after being sold for $1.4 million at Keeneland in 2007. Her other foals have included World Ace, who won the Kisaragi Sho and the Yomiuri Milers Cup. As a daughter of the broodmare Mandellicht she was a half-sister to Manduro. Racing career =2018: two-year-old season= World Premiere made his debut on 21 October in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1800 metres at Kyoto Racecourse and won from Meisho Tengen (a colt who went on to win the Yayoi Sho). On 24 November the colt was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Kyoto Nisai Stakes over 2000 metres at the same track and started at odds of 2.4/1 in an eight-runner field. He was restrained towards the rear of the field before making progress in the straight and came home third behind Courageux Guerrier and Breaking Dawn, beaten four lengths by the winner. In the official ratings for Japanese two-year-olds World Premiere was awarded a mark of 102, fourteen pounds behind the top-rated Admire Mars. =2019: three-year-old season= World Premiere made a successful start to his second season when he defeated Unicorn Lion and six others in the Tsubaki Sho over 1800 metres at Kyoto on 16 February. At Hanshin Racecourse a month later he ran second to Velox in the Listed Wakaba Stakes over 2000 metres. The performance qualified him to run in the Satsuki Sho but a \\"bucked shin\\" kept him off the track until the autumn. After a break of more than six months World Premiere returned in the Grade 2 Kobe Shimbun Hai (a major trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2400 metres at Hanshin on 22 September. Ridden as in all his previous starts by Yutaka Take he started at odds of 12.2/1 and finished third behind Saturnalia and Velox. After the race Yasuo Tomomichi commented \\"He sweated up a bit in the paddock last time and wasn't so relaxed, but in the race itself he ran well, finishing strongly, so I was pleased with that\\". On 20 October World Premiere, with Take in the saddle, was one of eighteen three-year-olds to contest the 80th running of the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. He was made the 5.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Velox and Nishino Daisy (Tokyo Sports Hai Nisai Stakes) while the other contenders included Red Genial (Kyoto Shimbun Hai), Unicorn Lion and Meisho Tengen. World Premiere started quickly but was then restrained by Take and settled behind the leaders on the rails as the outsider Caudillo set a steady pace. Take made a forward move entering the straight and World Premiere gained the advantage 200 metres out before holding off the late challenge of Satono Lux by a neck with Velox a length away in third place. Take commented \\"He was a bit keen at first but was in hand nicely during the race. He wasn‚Äôt able to run in the first two of the Triple Crown races so I am glad that he was able to claim the last one. He‚Äôs still got a lot to improve so I‚Äôm looking forward to his future races.\\" Tomomichi added \\"He's recovered over the summer from his spring campaign of races, and it's good he's had the one recent run to sharpen him up. While he can misbehave a little, he seems to have improved on this front, and in some ways, I think this is actually good for him\\". For his final run of the year World Premiere was matched against older horses in the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 22 December. He raced towards the rear of the field before staying on strongly in the straight to take third place behind Lys Gracieux and Saturnalia. In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, World Premiere finished fifth in the poll to determine the Best Three-Year-Old Colt.

A vassal of Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, O'Cahan was regularly in rebellion alongside his lord in the closing years of the 16th century. Although he did not go into exile with Tyrone, he claimed to have been betrayed by the English Crown, which he accused of failing to keep to an agreement over a large grant of lands. Arrested for treason, he was never brought to trial but was held captive in Dublin Castle until his death sometime around 1627. Life and career O'Cahan was a major Ulster landholder and has been described as \\"the last in a long line of chieftains\\" ruling the area between the River Bann in Belfast to the River Foyle in Derry, which he held off the O'Neill Earls of Tyrone as their liegeman (ur ri‚Äîor under king‚Äîin gaelic). His main property was in Dungiven. He also held Limavady. He spent much of the 1590s in armed rebellion with Tyrone against the crown; his lands were \\"viciously ravaged\\" by Docwra until O'Cahan surrendered in 160s. About a third of O'Cahan's lands in Londonderry were granted to Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who was also O'Cahan's father-on-law. O'Cahan and the Flight of the Earls In September 1607 Tyrone and other earls fled the country; the same month, O'Cahan was knighted. In early 1608, O'Cahan's brother joined the rebellion of Cahir O'Doherty, and although O'Cahan was not officially implicated, he was suspected of having knowledge of the uprising. He was arrested but never tried. The antiquarian Francis Joseph Bigger has suggested that he was rumoured to have attempted flight with Tyrone and the other rebel lords, and had only been prevented from doing so by an \\"accidental delay in crossing some ferry on the road\\". In the vent, O'Cahan remained in Limavady Castle following Tyrone's flight. Sir Arthur Chichester‚Äîthe Crown's Lord Deputy in Ulster‚Äîreasoned, says Bigger, that this indicated not only his sympathy for the rebels but mens rea also. This was compounded by the fact that, in English eyes, O'Cahan \\"had become troublesome, and almost unmanageable of late, so, everything considered, it was thought best to take him also into special keeping at Dublin Castle\\". Bigger notes that, although O'Cahan had remained loyal to his liege lord throughout the latter's seven-year campaign at the Crown, in 1608 he joined the major English statesman and commander in Ireland, Henry Docwra, on condition that O'Cahan would receive sufficient grants and lands to enable him to establish himself independently of Tyrone, and would no longer hold his estates in fief. Downfall and death O'Cahan's arrangement with Docwra regarding his lands was agreed to by the government, but Chichester managed to persuade the government to repudiate the deal. O'Cahan, says Bigger, went \\"frantic\\": his behaviour allowed Chichester to claim that O'Cahan had spoken and acted treasonably. O'Cahan spent the rest of his life imprisoned in the Tower of London, dying there around 1626. During his imprisonment, the Plantation of Ulster continued westwards. However, his legal title to the Bann‚àíFoyle region was not contested and, even though O'Cahan was never to return, no individual planter ever laid claim to his estate.

The ship was built by AG Vulcan at Stettin in Prussia (now Szczecin in Poland), and was completed in June 1914. The ship served in the Baltic, North Sea and English Channel, taking part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May‚Äì1 June 1916 and the Battle of Dover Strait on 26/27 October that year. She survived the war after which she was surrendered under the Treaty of Versailles and scrapped in 1922. Construction and design In 1913, the Imperial German Navy placed orders for 12 high-seas torpedo boats, with six each ordered from AG Vulcan (V25‚ÄìV30) and Schichau-Werke (S31‚ÄìS36). While the designs built by each shipyard were broadly similar, they differed from each other in detail, and were significantly larger and more capable than the small torpedo boats built for the German Navy in the last two years. V26 was laid down as yard number 347 at AG Vulcan's Stettin shipyard, was launched on 21 February 1914 and commissioned on 1 August 1914. V26 was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Three oil-fired water-tube boilers fed steam to 2 sets of AEG- Vulcan steam turbines rated at , giving a speed of . of fuel oil was carried, giving a range of at . Armament consisted of three 8.8 cm SK L/45 naval guns in single mounts, together with six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes with two fixed single tubes forward and 2 twin mounts aft. Up to 24 mines could be carried. The ship had a complement of 83 officers and men. Service On 1 August 1914, Germany declared war on the Russian Empire, with the newly commissioned V26 was deployed to the Baltic coast-defence division as one of the few modern German torpedo boats in the Baltic. On 9 August, V26 along with sister ship and the torpedo boat accompanied the light cruisers and on a sortie into the Baltic. The torpedo boats turned back and returned to Memel on 11 August owing to fuel shortages. V26, V25 and V186 together with Augsburg and Magdeburg took part in another sortie into the Baltic from 15‚Äì20 August, escorting the minelayer on a mission to lay a minefield at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland. The operation was disrupted when they encountered the Russian cruisers and , forcing the minefield to laid out of position. The Russian ships did not attack because they thought that the German force was accompanied by two armoured cruisers. On 26 August, V26 was escorting Magdeburg on a sortie against Russian patrols in the Gulf of Finland when the cruiser ran aground off Osmussaar, Estonia. Attempts by V26 to pull Magdeburg clear failed, and V26 took off part of Magdeburgs crew before the arrival of the Russian cruisers and arrived, driving off V26. Unknown to the Germans, the Russians managed to salvage important German code books from Magdeburg, copies of which were passed to the British for use by Room 40. In September 1914, V26 and V186 were detached to the North Sea, replaced by six torpedo boats (G132‚ÄìG136) in the Baltic. In October 1914, V26 was part of the 17th Half Flotilla of the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. As a response to an unsuccessful attack on 18 October by the British submarine on the German cruiser at the entrance to the Baltic, the newly-formed 17th Half-Flotilla, including V26, was diverted from its work-up activities to carry out anti-submarine patrols in the Fehmarn Belt. On 19 October, the 17th Half Flotilla was relieved by the 8th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, and returned to Kiel. On 15 December 1914 the German battlecruiser squadron under the command of Franz von Hipper set out on an attack on the British east coast towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, West Hartlepool and Whitby, with the intent of drawing out parts of the British Grand Fleet where it could be defeated in detail. The 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, including V26 was part of the escort for Hipper's heavy ships. On 14 January 1915, the cruisers and , escorted by the 9th Torpedo boat Flotilla, including V26, set out to lay a minefield off the Humber. The weather was extremely poor, with the torpedo-boats struggling in the heavy seas, and after V26 collided with V25 causing minor damage, the torpedo boats turned back, leaving the two cruisers to carry on unescorted. The minefield claimed a British trawler, Windsor, on 22 January. On 10 February 1916, V26 took part in a sortie by 25 torpedo boats of the 2nd, 6th and 9th Torpedo-boat Flotillas into the North Sea. The sortie led to an encounter between several German torpedo boats and British minesweepers off the Dogger Bank, which resulted in the British minesweeper being torpedoed and sunk by ships of the 2nd Flotilla. On 24 April 1916, the German battlecruisers of I Scouting Group and the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group set out from Kiel on a mission to bombard the British East-coast towns of Yarmouth and Lowestoft, with the torpedo boats of the 6th and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas as escorts, and V26 as part of the 9th Flotilla. The battleships of the High Seas Fleet were deployed in support, with the hope of destroying isolated elements of the British Forces if they tried to intercept. There was a brief engagement between the German forces and the light cruisers and destroyers of the Harwich Force, which caused the German battlecruisers to break off the bombardment of Lowestoft, but rather than take the change to destroy the outnumbered British force, the Germans chose to retire. V26 participated in the Battle of Jutland as part of the 17th Half Flotilla of the 9th Flotilla, in support of the German battlecruisers. The 9th Flotilla, including V26, took part in an attempted torpedo attack on British battlecruisers from about 17:26 CET (16:26 GMT). V26 managed to launch a single torpedo at the British battlecruisers (which missed, like all the German torpedoes launched during this attack), but the attack was disrupted by British destroyers of the 13th and the 10th Destroyer Flotillas, which were attempting an attack on the German battlecruisers. The German torpedo boat was disabled by a shell in her engine room during this engagement, while was hit by a torpedo from the British destroyer . V26 collected the crew of V27, before attempting to scuttle the stricken torpedo boat. An attempt to torpedo V27 failed when the torpedo would not run straight, and V26 was forced to sink V27 by gunfire. V26, together with , then took off the crew of the sinking V29. From about 20:15 CET (19:15 GMT), V26 took part in a large-scale torpedo attack on the British fleet in order to cover the outnumber German battleship's turn to west. V26 launched three torpedoes, which as with all the torpedoes launched in this attack, missed. While V26 was unharmed in this attack, several torpedo boats were damaged by heavy British fire, and S35 was sunk. V26 was part of the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla during the inconclusive Action of 19 August 1916, when the German High Seas Fleet sailed to cover a sortie of the battlecruisers of the 1st Scouting Group. In October 1916, the 3rd and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas were ordered to reinforce the German naval forces based in Flanders, in order to disrupt the Dover Barrage, a series of anti submarine minefields and nets that attempted to stop U-boats from operating in the English Channel, and to directly attack cross-Channel shipping. The twenty torpedo boats of the two flotillas, including V26, now part of the 18th Half Flotilla of the 9th Flotilla, left Wilhelmshaven on 23 October, reaching Belgium the next day. The 9th Flotilla took part in a large scale raid into the English Channel on the night of 26/27 October 1916, and was assigned the role of attacking Allied shipping while other torpedo boats went after the Dover Barrage, with the 18th Half Flotilla, including V26, to operate off Calais. The 18th Half Flotilla successfully passed through the British defences of the Dover Straits, despite twice encountering British warships on the journey through the barrage. Four British destroyers on passage to Dunkirk were spotted, but failed to see the German ships, while the old destroyer spotted the 18th Half Flotilla and challenged them, but the Germans repeated Flirts signal and continued on course, with Flirt mistaking the ships for the Laforey division and not engaging or reporting the ships. The 18th Half Flotilla did not encounter any of the hoped for merchant ships, but on its return journey clashed with three British destroyers which attempted to pursue, but lost contact after German fire caused Mohawks rudder to jam. Other German units sank several drifters that were part of the Dover Barrage together with Flirt (which was attempting to rescue the crews of the drifters) and the merchant ship , and badly damaged the destroyer . The 9th Flotilla continued to operate from Flanders, attacking shipping off the coast of the Netherlands on 1 November. On the night of 23/24 November, V26 was one of 13 torpedo boats that took part in an attempt to attack shipping in the Downs. While they clashed briefly with patrolling drifters, they found none of the shipping anchored on the Downs. On the night of 26/27 November, the 9th Flotilla sortied again, stopping the Dutch merchant ship Beijerland and taking her pilot prisoner, and sinking the naval trawler . The torpedo boats and collided during this sortie, badly damaging both ships. The 9th Flotilla (less the two damaged torpedo boats) returned to Germany on 30 November. V26 collided with the German submarine at Kiel on 19 March 1917, sinking UB-25 and killing 16 of the submarine's crew. UB-25 was subsequently salvaged and returned to service as a training submarine. By late April 1917, the torpedo boats of the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla had been fitted for minesweeping and their crews trained in that task, and became increasingly dedicated to minesweeping. The 9th Flotilla, together with the 6th Flotilla and the cruisers , , and took part in a commerce-raiding sortie into the Skaggerak and Kattegat on 10‚Äì13 March 1918. V26 remained part of the 9th Torpedo Boat Flotilla in November 1918, when the Armistice of 11 November 1918 stopped the fighting between Germany and the Allies. =Post-war operations and disposal= By the terms of the Armistice, a large proportion of the Imperial German Navy, including 50 modern torpedo boats, was interned at Scapa Flow in the Orkneys. V26 remained in German hands, however, forming part of the Eisernen Flottille, a volunteer force of torpedo boats remaining in active service and used for security duties, although the ship's torpedo tubes were removed under the terms of the Armistice. On 21 June 1919, the German fleet interned at Scapa scuttled itself, and as a result, Germany was forced to hand over more warships and equipment, including V26 to the Allies under the Treaty of Versailles to compensate for the ships scuttled at Scapa. The Allies decided to transfer 10 destroyers from the ships surrendered from the German and Austro-Hungarian to each of the French and Italian navies to replace wartime losses. Twenty of the best of the surrendered German torpedo boats, including V26, were therefore sent to Cherbourg in France to allow France and Italy to make their selection. The unwanted ships would be scrapped by Britain. V26 was not wanted, and was sold for scrap on 21 October 1920, and was scrapped at Portishead in 1922.

It received the 1978 Prix des Deux Magots in France. Japrisot also scripted the 1983 film adaptation directed by Jean Becker and starring Isabelle Adjani.  Plot  Eliane, or \\"Elle\\", a beautiful young woman settles into a mountain village with her Austrian mother (whom the local people mistake for a German and call 'Eva Braun') and disabled father Gabriel. Soon she becomes talk of the town because of her aloof but at the same time, sexually provocative behavior. She has an affair with Florimond Montecciari, nicknamed Ping-Pong, a car mechanic and volunteer fireman. Soon Eliane insinuates herself into the Montecciari household, and starts inquiring about Ping-Pong's late father, and the old piano that the family keeps in the barn. It turns out that Eliane is out to avenge the long-ago rape of her own mother by three men who had arrived at her isolated house in a van which contained an old piano which they were delivering. Eliane is the child of that rape, and doesn't know her real father. Since the father of the Montecciaris is already dead, she decides to take revenge on the two suspects who are still alive: Leballech and his brother-in-law Touret. She poses as a young teacher and rents an apartment from Touret to be closer to her targets. At the same time she marries Ping- Pong. Soon after the wedding, she disappears and is later found in Marseille. She has regressed into childhood, and has to be institutionalized in a clinic. Seeing his wife's mental state, Ping-Pong believes that Eliane is the victim of Leballech and Touret who prostituted her, according to the rumors she spread before she had lost her mind. He tracks down and shoots both men before realizing his mistake. He discovers that Eliane was wrong: her adoptive father Gabriel had long ago shot the real culprits. Ping-Pong is arrested and recounts the whole story to his attorney.  Style and structure  The novel opens with a quote from Lewis Carroll‚Äôs Alice in Wonderland: ‚ÄúI'll be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.\\" Marina Kundu writes in her analysis of the novel: \\"The reader follows the process of detection of the criminal‚Äôs identity through the separate testimonies of four characters. All are involved in Elle‚Äôs plan of vengeance, all assume a wider reference than would be indicated by their individual designations as victim, witness, juror or judge.\\" And yet none of them is able to prevent the fatal course of events: \\"Like the analogous extratextual readers, they are trapped by the narrative situation‚Äîby the detective novel's peculiarity of being narrated backwards, inversely from the moment of the revelation of the criminal.\\" The book is divided into six parts: \\"The Executioner\\" narrated by Ping-Pong; \\"The Victim\\" narrated by Eliane; \\"The Witness\\" narrated by Ping-Pong's Aunt Nine nicknamed Cognata; \\"The Indictment\\" narrated by Eliane's mother; \\"The Sentence\\" again narrated by Eliane who is now revealed to be 'judge and jury'; \\"The Execution\\" narrated by Ping-Pong who is by this point emerges as the true victim. The text is constructed in a circular fashion: Chapter One begins and ends with the same phrase: \\"I said OK,\\" and Chapter Six ends at the point at which this phrase from Chapter One is uttered in 'real time.' Japrisot occasionally uses present-tense narration, especially in Eliane's sections \\"giving a sense of narration simultaneous with the actions recounted, and thus avoiding the artificiality of a retrospective narrator concealing his hindsight.\\"  Reception  One Deadly Summer was the winner of the 1978 Prix des Deux Magots in France, and received positive reviews from critics. Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"Slow to build as its four narrators come and go, this psychological crime-suspense is nevertheless unreeled with the taut, confident shaping of a grand master; Japrisot‚Ä¶ has finally found just the right balance between very Gallic atmospheric density and ironic, tragically twisting events.\\" The reviewer then added: \\"In other hands, this sexual melodrama might have come across as both contrived and lurid; here, however, it's a rich and resonant sonata in black, astutely suspended between mythic tragedy and the grubby pathos of nagging everyday life.\\" Jean Strouse wrote in Newsweek: \\"Fragments of her [Eliane's] disturbing story come slowly together like the pieces in a psychological jigsaw puzzle‚Äîrape, murder, incest, revenge, split personality. Japrisot slices into these small-town European lives with all the precision of a fine surgeon. He gets each voice just right, in Alan Sheridan's deft translation, and Elle's bizarre behavior gradually begins to make sense. By the end, you feel more sympathy than horror at the ghastly truth.\\" Reviewing the paperback edition, The New York Times commented: \\"This chilling story of psychological suspense is the work of a French novelist who has been influenced by American crime writing, yet on its own terms it is a most original creation.\\" David Bellos wrote: \\"Japrisot's novel engages with painful, paradoxical and profound dimensions of human life, and no one who reads it can fail to be moved, scared, fascinated, and to a degree, transformed by it.\\"  Publications in English  * New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980 *London: Secker and Warburg, 1980 * New York: Penguin Books, 1981 * New York: Plume, 1997 * London : Harvill, 2000 *Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 2019  Film adaptation  * 1983: One Deadly Summer, French film directed by Jean Becker and starring Isabelle Adjani as Eliane and Alain Souchon as Ping-Pong.

In 1969 IFDA began taking a stance against imports of foreign films, supporting a tax that would encourage films with smaller budgets and higher quality. In 1978, IFDA campaigned for more movie theatres to be built, working with state governments and National Film Development Corporation of India to open 100 new theatres.

Aanes received both a Bachelors and Master's in Special Education from the University of Northern Colorado following spending two years in the Peace Corps. Her other career focus was in the physical disability field. She founded the community, Access Alaska, which allows people with physical disabilities to live independently. The majority of her career was devoted to her advocacy and activism for people with physical disabilities in Alaska, particularly mentally competent adults. Her activism contributed to the development of the numerous Centers for Independent Living, serving the state of Alaska (both rural and downtown).She was inducted into the Alaska Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame in 2012 for her work in helping disabled persons gain access to independent living in Alaska.  Early life  = Peace Corps = Aanes' work with people with disabilities began in 1965 when she was stationed in Ethiopia as a Peace Corp Volunteers. In 1967, Aanes relocated her work to Turkey. = Education = Upon arriving back in the US, Aanes went to college at the University of Northern Colorado. After graduating from the University of Northern Colorado in 1969 with a Bachelor's in Special Education, Aanes went on to get her Master's in Special Education from the University of Northern Colorado, finishing in 1969.  Career  = Alaska = Aanes was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2012 for her work on Advocacy. Other inductees include Politician and Governor, Sarah Palin, and Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race Champion, Susan Butcher. In 1971, she returned to Alaska where she began teaching students with physical disabilities in a classroom setting. Her role in the lives of the physically disabled evolved when she resigned from teaching and became actively involved in advocacy for the standards of living of the physically disabled. Her mission revolved around changing the then existing circumstances for high school graduates with physical disability, who had limited opportunities and were housed in nursing homes with senior citizens with conditions like dementia. She then founded Access Alaska, the first independent living program where her work involved campaigning to ensure the disabled had equal access to resources like housing, transportation, restrooms and restaurants and also opportunities to actively participate in society through respectable jobs and vocational training. Aanes also championed efforts on the legislative front to grow support for the Independent Living movement by speaking at public hearings, soliciting financial support and highlighting the need for changing related laws. Her efforts were rewarded in 1980, with Access Alaska receiving a state grant to address issues including independent-living-skills training and amenities she would need to facilitate her work.

Following the release of her long- delayed debut album, Night Time, My Time (2013), Ferreira announced her follow-up, titled Masochism, shortly thereafter. The album has seen frequent delays, with intended releases including 2015, 2016, and 2018, with the current target date being in 2020. To promote the record, Ferreira released the single \\"Downhill Lullaby\\" in March 2019 and has teased a slew of other songs off the record. Background In an interview with Paper magazine in 2018, Ferreira said the album was seeing frequent delays due to her being a \\"perfectionist\\". Among other issues, Ferreira has expressed frustration with her label over creative control of her music and the artistic direction they want to steer her in. Ferreira famously took to the internet to ask help in regaining control of her SoundCloud account which her label assumed responsibility for and changed her password to. While on a release hiatus, Ferreira has performed at music festivals, walked runways as a model, and acted in the film Baby Driver and the show Twin Peaks. In May 2019, Ferreira released the first single from Masochism, \\"Downhill Lullaby\\". The single was followed by the release of a cover of \\"Voices Carry\\" on SoundCloud in July.

India is regarded as having one of the largest commercial sex trades globally. Kamathipura is only one of many red-light district neighborhoods in Mumbai. These neighborhoods are so large and popular that Mumbai has been called the \\"ultimate destination\\" for sex tourism. The red-light districts or lal bazaars in Mumbai are inhabited by thousands of sex workers including women, men, children, and transgender people. The sex workers of Mumbai are typically victims of sex trafficking, made vulnerable as a result of poverty, and lack of access to resources and opportunities. Sex workers in Mumbai face many difficulties in their lives.  History of Mumbai  Mumbai is the capital city of the state of Maharashtra and is one of the largest cities in India with an estimated population of over 18 million people. India is considered to be the global epicenter of sex work and has the largest commercial sex trade in the world. Mumbai is the largest city in the state of Maharashtra and is often referred to as the ultimate sex tourist destination. India is a country made up of people that celebrate and practice a variety of cultural and religious traditions, and the people that make up India come from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. Although India is not unique in gender- discrimination based violence it is a country that on one hand controls the sexuality of women yet is also home to one the largest flourishing commercial sex trades. One of the red light districts in Mumbai emerged from British colonial rule in the middle of the nineteenth century. It was created out of a fear of British soldiers engaging in homosexual relations with other soldiers. The British also saw an additional reason for needing prostitution, especially amongst the military. It was seen as necessary to stave off boredom among soldiers and to reinforce imperial dominance through sexual control of Indian women. In creating a zone for British soldiers to engage in \\"safe heterosexual relations\\" British colonial administration held the power to separate the brothel area from the \\"respectable\\" residential areas which granted them power and control over the lives of the sex workers. Research into sex work in Mumbai originally drew attention to the HIV/AIDS patterns discovered there. Researchers have subsequently studied the state of sex work in Mumbai by interviewing and collecting the narratives of those involved in and affected by sex work.  Terminology  Svati P. Shah, an anthropologist who studies gender and women in South Asia, says that the use of the term prostitution is a matter of context and argues against its use as a universal term that combines all forms of transactional sex into a singular conceptual framework. While those involved in current and past research concerning this issue typically employ the term sex work, others argue that prostitution refers more to human trafficking. Some supporters of the abolition of prostitution reject the use of the term sex worker as they argue that it legitimises prostitution. According to the anthropologist Susanne Asman there were vague terms used in Ichigyang to refer to women engaging in sex work; they were often described as \\"Bombay going\\" or \\"women doing that work\\". The terminology used to describe sex work in Mumbai depends on context.  State of sex work in Mumbai  Mumbai contains the largest red light district in Asia, in the neighborhood of Kamathipura. Kamathipura is estimated to have over five thousand sex workers, who are identified as male, female, and transgender. Of the estimated five thousand sex workers located in Kamathipura the majority are assumed to be victims of sex trafficking. However it is difficult to determine the exact number of those involved in trafficking in the red light districts of Mumbai due to the criminal nature of the issue and the scale of it. The victims are typically young girls, and are usually trafficked from the surrounding areas, but they are sometimes trafficked from neighboring countries such as Nepal and Bangladesh. Hijaras can also be found working in the red light districts of Mumbai. It has been argued that hijaras are more likely to participate in high risk sex acts with clients because it is believed they cannot contract or spread disease or illness. Sex workers in Mumbai at brothels and other commercial sex sites are visited by both men from the local area and those traveling to the area in search of employment. Currently there are a large amount of vague restrictions regarding the act of participating in sex work.  Sex workers in Mumbai  Many studies have indicated that sex workers in Mumbai enter into the sex industry for a range of reasons. Many of the interviews and studies that have been conducted demonstrate that when people enter or are forced into the industry it is usually as a result of some kind of crisis. Researchers have used interviews to study how and why women participate in sex work. Through these interviews it has been concluded that female sex workers typically end up in sex work for a variety of reasons ranging from but not limited to marital abuse, death of their husband, poverty, or death of a parent. Researchers have identified these scenarios as some of the most common. Ashwini Tambe, professor and scholar in gender and women studies, argues that in Mumbai the realm of sex work and the role of family are not separate. In studying the role of sex workers in Mumbai, it was also found that many women are sold into sex work by friends, acquaintances, or family members. Increased economic hardship can result in women such as housewives and daily laborers using sex work as a method of securing additional income to support themselves and/or their families. According to Robert Friedman, an American investigative journalist, human rights organizations say that over 90% of female sex workers in Mumbai are considered indentured servants. Traditionally research has usually concerned itself with the situation of female and child sex workers in Mumbai, ignoring the increasing proportion of male and transgender sex workers. Including male sex workers in discussions about the state of sex work in Mumbai is necessary, as male sex workers are considered a high-risk group for HIV infection. As research has developed concerning the role of male sex workers in Mumbai it has been demonstrated through interviews that although these men's responses vary with their sexual identities, their soliciting practices, sex roles and clientele, they nevertheless indicate that they entered into sex work as a result of their poor economic status. As efforts have increased to enforce anti-human trafficking and HIV/AIDS prevention, brothels have become the main target of these preventive measures. This has increased the diversification of sex work occurring in Mumbai as clients have become more likely to seek services outside of brothels because they believe they are less likely to contract HIV/AIDS. = Conditions of sex workers in Mumbai = Social workers have been given the responsibility of addressing the issues associated with sex trafficking in Mumbai, and the large amount of young girls trafficked. As the industry continues to expand the demand for young girls has begun to rise. The brothels in the red light districts of Mumbai are patrolled by goondas, thugs who work for or are part of the mafia, to ensure that enslaved sex workers do not escape or run away. Police raids are said to target mostly girls from outside India and also underage girls, who are often kept out of view by brothel owners. Many of the young women who are sex workers in Mumbai work under madams or have pimps The madams of female sex workers usually receive payment upfront for the female sex worker performing the sex act. From their wages the female sex workers typically have to pay for electricity, food, rent, interest, and bribes paid to local police. In recent years Mumbai has reported a dwindling number of brothels as a result of gentrification, heightened anti-trafficking efforts and police enforcement raids. This has resulted in the dispersal of sex workers, increasing their vulnerability. While efforts to encourage women sex workers to use condoms have been emphasized, their users often face stigmatization. Young girls who have been trafficked into sex work often have no autonomy and no choice as to whether or not they use condoms when engaging in sex work. Condoms are also not used when a girl is presented and sold to a client as a virgin ‚Äì a practice known as sar dhaki ‚Äì demonstrating that despite targeted efforts to ensure safer working conditions this remain an issue. = HIV and AIDS patterns in Mumbai = Following the first case of HIV/AIDS identified in Mumbai, efforts to prevent the disease were undertaken. With the implementation of these efforts advocates recognized they had to understand the functioning of the sex industry. As efforts to engage with sex workers for HIV/AIDS prevention increased, many of these concentrated solely on female sex workers, neglecting male and transgender sex workers. From 2006 to 2009, Mumbai experienced an intensive HIV prevention campaign and there was increased use of safer sex in brothels and among street-based sex workers. Programs intended to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS range from but are not limited to efforts that include peer based education, condom distribution, increased screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections and diseases. Between the years 2006 and 2009 the rates of women with HIV in Maharashtra went from 26% to 27.5%, with a large proportion of these infection rates coming from Mumbai. According to Human Rights Watch more than half of the population of sex workers in Mumbai have contracted HIV. It is a characteristic of some Arab and Indian men to bid for and purchase virgin sex workers from Mumbai as it is believed that sex with a virgin can cure gonorrhea and syphilis. Some female sex workers develop a relationship with their clients, considering them a lover or a partner. In this case they often will not use a condom with the partner, even if they are HIV positive.  Research  Svati P. Shah, the author of Street Corner Secrets and other works about research into the conditions of red light districts in Mumbai, has been working to broaden the discussion about the conditions there. Shah warns those interested in doing research work in Mumbai against sensationalizing the conditions of sex work and the patterns of HIV and AIDS. The anthropologist Susanne Asman has studied the lives of women sex workers who have returned to Nepal after working and living in Mumbai for some years. Over the course of ten years Susanne Asman collected information and conducted fieldwork concerning stories, lives and behaviour patterns of women sex workers returning to their home villages from Mumbai. As research has developed and more nuanced studies have been released many researchers still place much emphasis on the practices and politics of sex work.

Already in 1792 he was enrolled as a student of law at the University of Greifswald, from 1796 he studied at the University of Jena. There he received his doctorate in law in 1798. In 1800 he began studying Swedish law at Uppsala University. In 1802 he was appointed adjunct professor at the University of Greifswald, as teacher of Swedish Law. In 1806 Schildener was appointed to a Swedish commission to translate Swedish legal texts into German so that they could be adopted for Swedish Pomerania. The commission, in which Schildener collaborated with Ernst Moritz Arndt, first worked in Lund and then in Stockholm until 1807. The main translation \\"The Swedish Reich's Law, Approved and Adopted at the Reichstag in 1734\\" was published in 1807 in Stockholm, but was no longer put into effect in Pomerania. When the work was completed, Swedish Pomerania was occupied by France, so that Schildener could not return to Greifswald until 1809. In 1810 Schildener became associate professor and in 1814 full professor at the University of Greifswald, later also rector of the university. In 1818 he published for the first time in Germany the Swedish folk law of the island Gotland. Since the 1820s his health has deteriorated. On 28 December 1843 he died in Greifswald at age 66.  Family  From 1803 Schildener was married to Ingeborg Juliane Elisabeth Muhrbeck (1784-1824), a daughter of the philosophy professor Johann Christoph Muhrbeck. The two had twelve children, among them were:Erich G√ºlzow: Homeland letters Ernst Moritz Arndts.

The event took place at the Estadio de B√©isbol Monterrey in Monterrey on December 1, 2019. It marked the 27th year in a row that AAA had held a Tripleman√≠a show, and the 33rd overall show held under the Tripleman√≠a banner since 1993. The annual Tripleman√≠a show is AAA's biggest event of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines in what has been described as AAA's version of WrestleMania or their Super Bowl. Production =Background= 2019 marked the 27th year that the Mexican professional wrestling company Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (Triple A or AAA) has held their annual flagship Tripleman√≠a show. Tripleman√≠a Regia was the 33rd overall Tripleman√≠a show promoted by AAA (AAA promoted multiple Tripleman√≠a shows over the summers of 1994 to 1997). Since the 2012 event, Tripleman√≠a had taken place at the Arena Ciudad de M√©xico (Mexico City Arena), an indoor arena in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, Mexico that has a maximum capacity of 22,300 spectators. Tripleman√≠a Regia was the first Tripleman√≠a event held outside of Arena Ciudad de M√©xico since 2012 and the first outside Mexico City since 2007. AAA's Tripleman√≠a is their biggest show of the year, AAA's equivalent of WWE's WrestleMania or New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom event. =Storylines= Tripleman√≠a Regia featured eight professional wrestling matches, with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they engaged in a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match. On October 30, 2019, AAA announced that All Elite Wrestling's Kenny Omega would be defending the AAA Mega Championship at the event. On November 7 at the Tripleman√≠a Regia press conference, it was announced that Omega would face Dragon Lee, who will be making his AAA debut.

Contents Several scenarios are detailed that a game-master can develop into a series of adventures, in which the player characters must try to foil the evil machinations of a necromancer's cult. Plots include including an expedition to a tomb and an attempt to enter a guarded castle undetected. The book also includes new traps, monsters and detailed histories and descriptions of non-player characters. The scenarios are not keyed to any particular role-playing game system, so the game-master must choose a game system and adapt the material to it. Publication history Peter L. Rice and Wm. John Wheeler, through their company The Companions, had previously published two adventures in the \\"Islandia Brotherhood Campaign\\" that could be used with any fantasy role- playing game such as Dungeons & Dragons or RuneQuest. Brotherhood of the Bolt was the third in this series. The 40-page book with three maps was written by Rice and Wheeler with additional material by Ray Estabrook, Donna McKinnon, William R. Mohler, Matthew Needham, and Dennis O'Brien. The artwork was by Rice and Wheeler as well as John Carlson, Tom Cobb, Mary Coman, David J. Hutchins, Kevin LaChance, Matthew Needham, and Eric Pfusch. It was published by The Companions in 1983. Rice and Wheeler followed this book with Street of Gems and Gems for Death. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed this product twice in the pages of Dragon: * In the January 1984 edition (Issue #81), Rolston admitted that the scenarios were not the most original, nor were the production values and writing style the most professional. But he thought that \\"the novelty and virtue of the supplement lies not in the dramatic situations, but in their organization... The layout and organization displays a command of advanced technique and enlightened awareness of GM needs.\\" However, Rolston did point out that because the adventures were not designed for a specific game system, each gamemaster would have to \\"spend substantial time and effort in preparing Brotherhood of the Bolt for play.\\" But Rolston concluded, \\"Nonetheless, given the quality of the presentation and fantasy atmosphere, and the relatively small cast of NPCs who must be adapted, the GM‚Äôs investment will be well repaid.\\" * In the July 1988 edition (Issue #135), Rolston called the adventures \\"excellent\\", but noted that the book was out of print. Mike Dean reviewed Brotherhood of the Bolt for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"a word to the GM: these modules will provide your group with many sessions of play, but only if you are prepared to put in the necessary time and work for conversion and full understanding of the plots running through each of them.\\" Reviews *White Wolf #40 (1994) References Category:Fantasy role- playing game adventures ","title":"Brotherhood of the Bolt"},{"id":"62203238","text":"Aleksandra \\"Sasha\\" Belyaeva () is a Russian musician and social artist. In 2019 she independently released her debut EP \\"Greatest Illusion\\". Vice Magazine reviewed the release calling it \\"Ultra Visionary\\", while L'Officiel Magazine labeled Belyaeva as \\"The Most Anticipated Music Artist of the Year\\". Sasha is known for her unconventional and secretive performances, having performed only two shows to an invite only audience at The Light Church in Osaka, and the Secret Roxy Suite at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Belyaeva began her career as a fashion model with a Chanel contract. She is the only Russian music artist signed to a major record label in the United States. Her music is described as atmospheric innovative pop. Early life Belyaeva was born November 28, 1998 in Sosenski, a small mining town in the Kaluga region of the Russian Federation. Belyaeva is the great-granddaughter of St. Nikolai Podeski, Patron Saint of Martyrs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_Belyaeva#Early_life At age 14, she left home to pursue a career in fashion while continuing to study. She made her debut for Karl Lagerfeld in a 2016 Chanel couture show. She eventually secured a contract with Chanel before a one-year hiatus to pursue a career as an artist. Recognition and Success = Musical career = Belyaeva decided to leave Elite Model Management and set up her own talent management group with her long time agent. She then took a period of leave to carve a new path in music and art. Belyaeva is the only Russian music artist signed to a major record label in the United States. On her most recent EP, she collaborated with Tom Krell (How To Dress Well). Her debut music video which was directed by Jesse McGowan, combines elements of Ex-Machina and Alexander McQueen's famed Kate Moss hologram. = Hidden Shows = In May 2019, Belyaeva hosted her first experiential performance at Church of the Light in Osaka, Japan to a small audience of fans and journalists. In June 2019, Belyaeva held her second show at Radio City Music Hall, inside the \\"Roxy Suite\\", formerly the private apartment of the Hall's impresario, Samuel Roxy Rothafel. She immersed the attendees by having them sit in the dark room which had been filled with live butterflies under a black light while she performed. =Greatest Illusion EP= In 2019 Belyaeva collaborated with Tom Krell on her debut EP, \\"Greatest Illusion\\". Belyaeva released the EP without label support, stating that her and her management would fund the project on their own to ensure its artistic integrity. Her 1990s experimental influences are similar to Bjork, Elizabeth Fraser, Sinead O'Connor and Madonna's. =Social Organizing= Kendall Jenner In August 2019, after Kendall Jenner reportedly insulted other fashion models by stating in LOVE Magazine \\"I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the f--k those girls do\\". Belyaeva and her hacktivist associates developed a strategy to have Jenner banned from participating in the 2019 New York Fashion Week. Belyaeva and her acomplices activated the fashion community by creating and pressured the industry decision makers prior to the event. They used methods of data and digital conversation analysis to increase engagement to force the fashion leadership to choose between Jenner and the models, while utilizing conventional media such as arranging coverage in the New York Post of the activation. They succeeded, earning 30,000 comments on the page, and 700 models signing a petition to not participate in the event. =Business= Fourth Turning Belyaeva has developed a media platform called Fourth Turning, taking its name from the last phase of the Strauss‚ÄìHowe generational theory. The Platform and Newsletter shares media analysis, interviews, current art, and political analysis to individuals who sign up to its mailing list via the website.

Contents Bug City is a 160-page softcover book that was designed by Robert Cruz, Tom Dowd, Mike Nystul, Diane Piron-Gelman, and Christopher Kubasik, with interior art by Jim Nelson, Tom Baxa, Peter Bergting, Joel Biske, Earl Geier, Jeff Laubenstein, Larry MacDougall, and Jeff Miracola, and cover art by Rick Berry and Mike Nielsen. Using the Shadowrun rules system, this adventure is one of three supplements that describes the story arc of the 2057 United American and Canadian States presidential election. Bug City is set in Chicago, where giant insects have magically appeared. Government authorities have isolated the city within a \\"Containment Zone\\", trapping a million people along with the ravenous insects. Players control characters that are in the Containment Zone. =The election= FASA allowed Shadowrun players to vote on which of the six unusual candidates would win the presidential election of 2057. In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons, author Shannon Appelcline wrote \\"By the mid-'90s FASA was innovating its storyline. The game's metaplot had always been important, but now players were given the chance to influence the United Canadian and American States Election of 2057 by voting for the new president. This plot ran through Bug City (1994), Super Tuesday (1996), and Dunkelzahn's Secrets (1996). Some felt the intended outcome was pushed by FASA, but nonetheless the dragon Dunkelzahn was elected based on player votes ‚Äî then promptly assassinated.\\" Reception In the November 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue #223), Rick Swan thought the premise of the book was \\"highly amusing.\\" Swan did find the introduction section boring, although \\"once past the introduction, the book comes alive, presenting a riveting look at a besieged community that‚Äôs half ant farm, half leper colony.\\" Although he found the illustrations \\"first-rate\\", he thought the maps \\"leave a lot to be desired.\\" He found the game mastering section \\"provides excellent staging tips and a terrific set of optional rules.\\" Swan thought elements of the book needed more development, specifically the insects ‚Äî \\"Each insect species receives just a page or so of description, far too little to adequately cover their life cycles, social structures, and personalities\\" ‚Äî and a lot of intriguing but under-explored concepts. He also noted that referees had a lot of homework reading to do, since Bug City references nearly a dozen other Shadowrun sourcebooks. However, Swan concluded by giving the book an above average rating of 5 out of 6, saying, \\"a cast of characters this engaging makes Bug City hard to resist.\\" Awards Bug City won the Origins Awards for Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement of 1995.

After reintroduced worship at the former site of altar (in Solomon's Temple), the building of a new temple is initiated. Both the building of the altar and the foundation of the temple showed similarities to the one of the first temple, such as the importation of cedars from Lebanon () and the start of the project in the second month (which could be the appropriate time in early spring; cf. ). When the foundation of temple was laid, the people responded in different ways: the older ones who had seen the first temple wept loudly, while the younger ones gave a great shout of praise to God. =Verse 7= :They gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and to the people of Tyre so that they would bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, at Joppa, according to the grant they had from Cyrus king of Persia.

Contents Byzantium Secundus, the first supplement published for the Fading Suns role-playing game, is a 128-page softcover book designed by Christopher Howard, Andrew Greenberg, and Bill Bridges, with interior art by John Bridges, Tim Callender, Mike Chaney, Michael Gaydos, Craig Gilmore, Anthony Hightower, Mark Jackson, Brian Mead, Joshua Gabriel Timbrook, and J. Chadlee Stowe, and cover art by John Poreda. The planet Byzantium Secundus is the capital of a dangerous galactic segment of the Fading Suns setting. This supplement provides details of the planet in five chapters and an appendix: * \\"History\\" gives a historical background of the planet, and its rise and fall in power and influence. * \\"Places\\" details the geography of the planet. * \\"People\\" provides details on a list of notable personalities, including their personalities, aspirations, and game statistics. It also provides information about some of the indigenous creatures of the planet. * \\"Conspiracies\\" describes the many plots that are percolating among the rich and powerful. * \\"Drama\\" lists a number of plot ideas and story hooks that a referee could use to design a campaign. * The appendix gives information about the \\"Imperial Eye\\", the Emperor's secret intelligence service, and also suggests how players could design a character who is a member of the Imperial Eye. Reception In the January 1997 edition of Arcane (Issue 15), Andy Butcher called Byzantium Secundus \\"a very promising start for the Fading Suns system... There's very little here that isn't useful in some way.\\" The only downside Butcher foresaw was the amount of local politics detailed in the supplement: \\"If you if you're not really interested in politics, the book becomes much less useful... If you want your Fading Suns games to be space opera, and so simplify the issues, a lot of this book is wasted.\\" However, Butcher concluded by giving it a rating of 7 out of 10, calling it \\"a well-written, interesting sourcebook for a game with a great deal of potential, and if you do want your Fading Suns games to concentrate on politics, it really is a must.\\" In the August 1997 edition of Dragon (Issue 238), Rick Swan said this supplement \\"contains all the ingredients for a thrilling campaign\\", giving it an above average rating of 5 out of 6.

It was located on Troy Avenue and Dean Street in Weeksville, a historically black settlement in what is now Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York City. The asylum gradually deteriorated due to lack of funding, and closed in 1918 after an incident involving burst water pipes, which resulted in two students contracting frostbite and having their feet amputated.  History  The Home for Freed Children and Others was founded in 1866 by black Presbyterian minister Henry M. Wilson, black widow Sarah A. Tillman, and white general Oliver Otis Howard. It was originally used by freedwomen new to the northern United States as a place for their children while they searched for work. Their children were used as indentured servants to white and black families for a small payment going to the child in return. While it had some financial support from white patrons‚Äînamely Gen. Howard, for whom it is named‚Äîthe orphanage was staffed and managed primarily by African Americans due to Wilson's membership in the African Civilization Society which supported all-Black organizations and segregated Black schools. By 1868, the institution's finances were in disarray due to Wilson's mismanagement. In 1888, it was renamed the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum and moved to Brooklyn with Rev. William Francis Johnson (c.1820-1903), a blind preacher who was active in the struggle for equal rights, as the Superintendent. Under Johnson's leadership, the institution frequently obtained donations from Black churches, Black speakers, and more coverage in the news, creating close ties to the Black community. In the 1890s, the institution moved away from the indentured system to train students in industrial education to prepare them for the practical world of labor, business, and agriculture but which would limit formal studies. This led to the Hampton Institute recommending that four-fifths of the students should be engaged in institutional training and Booker T. Washington was tapped to secure funding from leading philanthropists. An annex was built first, and in 1899, a campaign was organized by Rufus L. Perry to build a school on an adjacent lot with funds secured from the state. In 1902, it was discovered that Johnson greatly mismanaged the orphanage's funds which spurred an investigation by the New York Comptroller and a grand jury. Johnson left the institution following the investigation in 1902, and the board of directors reorganized itself to include more white males, rather than African Americans and women. The demographic reorganization was done at the suggestion of the New York Comptroller in order to obtain more white donors. Rev. Powhattan E. Bagnall was elected as superintendent by the board as a replacement for Johnson. = Ota Benga = In September 1906, Congolese pygmy Ota Benga (aged about 23) was exhibited in the Monkey House of the Bronx Zoo. Controversy quickly ensued, and many prominent African American leaders, including Superintendent James H. Gordon, objected to the exhibit. By September 29, Benga was transferred to the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum where he was given a room to himself and treated as a visitor.  Howard Orphanage and Industrial School  View of Howard Orphanage and Industrial School. In 1908, the institution was renamed Howard Orphanage and Industrial School, and a white Quaker, L. Hollingsworth Wood, was named as its president. In 1910, the State Board of Charities deemed the Brooklyn location unsafe as a result of an investigation charging the institution with unsanitary conditions. Billed as the \\"Tuskegee of the North,\\" the orphanage moved 250 children from the Brooklyn location to a farm in Kings Park, Long Island to teach practical skills in 1911. The property had originally consisted of two large farms and later converted into a similar educational experiment for Jewish people to move away from tailoring and sweatshop occupations in the Lower East Side to agriculture, but the project later failed. Upon founding, Howard Orphanage and Industrial School planned to utilize the four existing cottages to house the 200 children with plans of building more cottages to house upwards of 1,000 pupils once funds could be secured. In 1913, Washington visited the school writing favorably of the experience.  Closure and legacy  By the mid-1910s, the institution was again in dire need of more funding to house greater numbers of orphans due to the influx of people moving north for work during World War I. In 1917, a committee that included George Foster Peabody, Oswald Garrison Villard and W.E.B. DuBois was formed to campaign for $100,000. However, by the end of the year, the campaign ended, unable to secure the funds in the midst of the war. Lack of funds and war shortages contributed to the institution's low coal supply and inability to repair burst pipes due to freezing temperatures. Following one incident where pipes froze and burst in January 1918, two students contracted frostbite and had to receive foot amputations after they warmed up their feet at the kitchen stoves. After the incident, the Commissioner of Charities, Victor F. Ridder, closed the institution. Ridder indicted the institution, but a Suffolk County grand jury declined to find the asylum guilty of negligence. The farm became property of W.P. Anderson, Commissioner of Agriculture for Russia who transformed it into an agricultural school for Russian boys. Upon its closure, trustees began using funds for tuition for Black students in Brooklyn. In 1956, it was renamed the Howard Memorial Fund.

Early life Born Minnie Winifred Gleeson on 9 February 1845 in Tipperary, Ireland, her father, Thomas Gleeson, was reputed to be a landowning squire. Gleim received a good education in England, including in the Romance languages. In 1869 she met John Edgar Gleim and the couple were married in Sussex, England the following year. John Gleim came from a wealthy St Louis family and enjoyed drinking and gambling. The family's financial affairs were entrusted to Mary so John could carry on his lifestyle without worrying about the financial matters. The couple soon emigrated to America. The couple lived in San Francisco and the New York, where Gleim was reputedly included in the \\"Rogues Gallery\\" of New York's most wanted felons. The couple settled in St Louis where they amassed a sizeable fortune, probably from prostitution. In 1888 the couple set out for Alaska to take advantage of the gold rush there. They were refused admission at the Canadian border twice, Gleim's reputation proceeding her. Missoula, Montana After failing move to Alaska, Mary Gleim came to Missoula in 1888 with her husband, and quickly saw the potential for prostitution with the large number of railroad workers in the town. She set up brothels one after another in West Front Street and ruled them with a fist of iron, becoming the \\"Queen of Missoula's Bad Lands\\". By 1890 she owned eight brothels. Commonly known as \\"Mother Gleim\\", she was one of Missoula's characters and eventually owned a considerable number of properties in Missoula and elsewhere. Weighing 300 lbs, Gleim, in addition to brothel-keeping, was reputed to be a smuggler of diamonds, opium, and Chinese railroad workers. Gleim appeared frequently before the county judge on various changes arising from her drunken rages, including verbal and physical assaults. She also appeared frequently in the civil court for refusal to pay contractors and to evict tenants who could not pay their rent. In January 1892, Gleim was convicted of assaulting two priests. Whilst drunk, she had attended church to pay respects to the \\"McCormick Child\\" who had recently died. She asked a group of priests for a candle to light in Latin. When the priests were unable to reply as they did not understand Latin, she ripped the frocks off Father J Neale and Brother Pascal Megazzini, claiming they were not fit to wear the holy raiments. Gleim was fined $50, but because she had previously fail to turn up for court forfeited bonds and the fine totalled $736.30. =Bobby Burns= Gleim has a long running feud with rival C.P \\"Bobby\\" Burns. Burns has once appeared as a witness against her in a dispute over property in Front Street. The pair had had numerous run-ins, and one occasion Burns was horse whipped and dragged half a block behind a team of horses. Bobby Burns' house was blown up in the early hours of 12 February 1894. Although the house was levelled, Burns survived the blast. Two men were soon arrested; Patrick Mason and William Reed. Reed was subsequently released and appeared as a witness for the prosecution. Mason was put on trial in August 1894 and the details of the conspiracy to kill Burns came to light. Gleim was accused of masterminding the plot and arrested. She was held in the county jail whilst awaiting trial. Gleim had taken a supply of liquor with her into the jail. Officers allowed Gleim out of the jail to collect rents from her properties in the red-light district. Whilst out, she assaulted a rival madam but no charges were brought. At her trail, future Governor of Montana, Joseph M. Dixon, was the prosecutor and Gleim was defended by Judge Newton W. McConnell and Joseph K. Wood. On 24 September she was found guilty and the following day was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment. Whilst incarcerated in Deer Lodge, Gleim was assaulted by another inmate, but never recovered fully from the stab wounds that were inflicted on her. Gleim's lawyers launched an appeal in November 1894 but this was turned down by the District Court of Missoula. That decision was appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, who overturned the previous decision. In October 1895 Gleim was released from jail pending a retrial. Two of the witnesses against her had committed suicide and others had moved away from the area. Bobby Burns died of a heart attack in March 1895. With no remaining witnesses, the state dropped the attempted murder charge against Gleim on 23 May 1896. Death Gleim died of influenza in West Front Street on 22 February 1914. Although she had lost $135,00 in a fail brick making enterprise, she left an estate of over $148,000. She died without a will and as her husband John had died in October 1896, her niece and nephew inherited her fortune. Her estate included property in Missoula, Ignatius, Ronan and Canada. Gleim left explicit instructions for her burial in the city cemetery. Whilst other headstones faced east and west, Gleim's faced the railroad so she could say goodbye to the railroad men who were her customers.

Thousands of Spaniards perished in this company and more than four hundred women, Spanish and mestizo children, captured by the victors, propped up with their blood the growing vitality of the Mapuche people and the other half of the separated territory went through a long moral crisis. That came with increasing misery to test the feeling of survival. Tom√°s Mar√≠n Gonz√°lez de Poveda. Of these Spanish troops under the command of Governor Alonso de Ribera (he arrived at February 11, 1601 to the Arauco War and died in Concepcion in 1617), Captain Don Gil de Vilches y Arag√≥n served. This young man came to the Arauco war in 1598 at 17 years of age, is a native of the city of Baeza, born in 1581, was the son of Juan de Vilches y Collados and Do√±a Mar√≠a de Arag√≥n, both with proven nobility. The historian Don Diego de Rosales quotes him: In 1609, when he was 28, he had a good situation for his services as captain, and he was awarded the following grant dated August 18, 1609, where he says: He married Mrs. Isabel de Mendoza y Valdivia, of which he had no succession, but continued his last name with natural children. He held the position of corregidor of the Maule party from 1632 to 1634. In 1641, at the age of 60, he authorized his wife to carry out tests, appointed his universal heiress and that after his days, they passed their properties to the Augustinian community, with the following condition: Captain Don Gil de Vilches y Arag√≥n is considered the first Spanish settled with all the properties in the lands of Talcamo, later called Talca. His widow Do√±a Isabel de Mendoza y Valdivia, in his last years of life was a nun in the convent of Las Agustinas de Santiago. On July 3, 1651, as a novice nun, the secretary appeared and ordered an Augustinian convent founded in his stay in Talca. After the general uprising of February 1655 in the Arauco War, the Spaniards sought refuge on the north bank of the Maule River, where camps and moats were built in these lands of the Order of San Agust√≠n. This fact could be considered as the first attempt at foundation. Successive attempts of foundation were made as a refuge for the Spaniards of the Arauco war, without any results. It is considered that the first attempt of foundation is of the governor Tom√°s Mar√≠n Gonz√°lez de Poveda in 1692, at the confluence of the Baeza and Piduco rivers, where he drew streets and squares.

The farmers of Cauquenes, Purapel, Loncomilla and Putag√°n, Rauqu√©n, Huenchullami, Vichuqu√©n, went there to their religious practices. The Augustinian Order had been installed since 1651. This formed the political and development center of the Maule party, where militias and good government gathered there. Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco was instructed to found between the city of Quillota and the Biob√≠o River, a city at the headquarters of Talcamo. This was the third time that the royal authority was going to work on this task, after the failed attempts of 1655 and 1692. The Governor of the Kingdom Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco arrived in Maule on May 12, 1742, the date of his founding act. This place should be the center of the new foundation, its main square, where its streets would be. Final settlement in the villa House of Juan Albano Pereira M√°rquez, where he grew up and studied Bernardo O'Higgins. Governor Manso de Velasco appointed Mr. Mauricio de Morales as an advisor to the corrector of Baeza, with the power to replace him. The governor gave Baeza the instructions that he should stick to the new foundation, these were: In October 1743, Manso de Velasco returned to Talca to inspect the work of the new population. He observed his prosperous state, his streets well delineated, although poor houses, since the landowners had not done theirs. This performance of the rich neighbors had a reason. The landowners, considering themselves noble, when descending from the conquerors, having lands and Indians, were reluctant to make their homes, because the fact of coming to a city placed them in the same condition as the commoners, who also acquired the status of noble by be the first founders of a city. This attitude led Governor Manso de Velasco to dictate in Talca, on October 12, 1743, a side on which serious fines were applied to those who would not come. These measures had a fast and favorable result. Since the end of 1743, they began to approach their directors and also saw their quality guaranteed by the so-called \\"Constitutions of the Villa de Talca\\". These were the provisions contained in the dictation of May 29, 1743, issued in accordance with the Royal Decree of April 5, 1744. This document was delivered to the Cabildo and rigorously preserved by him. In these Constitutions the status of the nobles, the neighbors and those who were not were regulated, and their rights and prerogatives were fixed. They said the neighbors would have free trade in their assets. ‚ÄúLandowners who can afford the privilege. Those who enjoy it, their children and descendants, only by condition that they contribute to public works. They were exempt from the obligation, the neighbors did all kinds of personal services, such as military, judicial, prisoners and couriers, to which they were obliged as mere neighbors. These landowners should only go in defense of the kingdom and the ordinances of a good government. Traded merchants, only they could sell in the nascent Villa. Those who established grocery stores would not pay real rights for ten years. They were authorized for three days, and three times a year, to hold fairs, free of the true right. Only the villagers could be lobbyists. These provisions left the neighborhood happy to have seen their privileges protected and without the burdens of war. The material advance had advanced rapidly from the inauguration of the defense of the Kingdom and the ordinances of May 12, 1742, until this date of the year 1745. The Corregidor Baeza had dedicated a lot of activity: he published the orders, notified the neighbors and told them that promised them honors and privileges. I order the priest and the employee. Thus, on April 18, 1744, he was able to make the first general registry of the nascent city and direct a relationship of his state with Governor Manso de Velasco and said: After this distribution, Juan Cornelio de Baeza continues, listing the other neighbors, without expressing their proximity or location within the plan of the new city. Their number reaches eighty-three, including all, whether noble or commoners, landowners or masters in minor arts, to the Indian executioner, Juan. This small population of 83 families, which had been grouped around the Plaza Mayor, site of the Perales, four blocks from the Agustino convent, that is, \\"site and houses inhabited by Gil de Vilches y Arag√≥n\\", formed a population, mainly composed of landowners and poor neighbors. The landowners of the north and south of the Maule brought their families and built their houses. Thus, we see in this primitive group of families, the Silva, Sep√∫lveda, Mart√≠nez de Vergara, de la Fuente, Besoain, Nieto de Silva, Rojas Vilches, Molina, Aguirre, de la Torre, Aliaga, Henr√≠quez, Verdugo, Olave, Velasco, Or√≥stegui , Albuerna, Arellano, Olivares, Toledo and Morales. The number of neighbors was increasing. Faced with such a good result, Manso de Velasco thought of giving him a Cabildo of his own, by virtue of the powers conferred on them by the royal bonds, a determination that would attract more the well-off neighbors and force them to settle in the nascent village, where the honors and prerogatives they could raise them \\"to the noble state\\" constant concern of that time. By decree of December 9, 1744, Manso de Velasco appointed the first Cabildo of the city of San Agust√≠n de Talca, with functions for the entire year of 1745. The members of this first cabildo were: Francisco de Silva, for the position of Ordinary. Mayor of first vote; Jos√© de Aguirre for mayor of second vote; to Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Or√≥stegui, by Ensign Royal, and councilors Mr. Jos√© Besoain and Mr. Jos√© Hilar√≠o de Velasco; Provincial Mayor of Bernardo de Azocar Hurtado de Mendoza and San Mart√≠n. All were rich landowners and neighbors of the town. The new population continued with its growth and material progress, new families and new public and private buildings were still arriving. On March 8, 1745, the corregidor Baeza returned to report on the state of the city, a report in which he says: 124 families live, of which 100 live in their homes; 24 with lots, of these 14 cemented and 10 with possession. In the same report, he adds, that the city has four bridges, two churches and the jail building under construction, since its walls are in a state of completion. The two churches were the Augustinian convent and the parish church, built by the priest Antonio de Molina y Cabello. On September 12, 1746, the priest Molina received from the neighbors the sum of 15,000 pesos. In 1750 the Franciscans began to build a chapel. From 1742 to 1760 more families were registered. In the census conducted by the corregidor Francisco de Echague, on October 16, 1760, the town presents 143 families, 20 were new, among which we can write Cruz, Vergara, Opazo, Gajardo Guerrero and Bravo Denaveda. The Augustinian Order Portrait of Juan Ignacio Molina The economic improvement, produced mainly by foreign trade, aroused the ambition of the Order, which saw its poor lands, converted into fertile and productive hands of working colonists. The Order planned to recover the lands and for this they made a plan. The residents of the convent of Talca, met on November 5, 1744, under the presidency of R. P. Lorenzo Guerrero, superior of the convent; of the brilliant reader R. P., Fray Luis Caldera, former provincial of the Province; and RR. PP Jos√© Sol√≠s, Alonso Soto, Justo V√©lez, etc. The provincial of the Order said that although the donation had been made without establishing the number of blocks and without consulting the convent, they now came to express the number of blocks donated. They agreed to give only \\"six blocks on each side of the square. The officers of the order subsequently met without finding any accusation against the neighboring landowners. In 1749, he came to take charge of the Order, Fray Nicol√°s Gajardo Guerrero, of a strong and reckless character. With the agreement of his convent, he learned that his brothers had not enforced their rights. Unable to contain himself, he rode a horse and headed to neighboring farms to destroy his fields and works. He attacked the weak incredibly. The neighbors suffered their threats and had to suffer many men who feared to defend themselves. At first, he tried to charge them the rent of the occupied lands and when the villagers resisted, he attacked them. The attitude of the Cabildo put an end to these activities of the Order. The Augustinians had had their supremacy for a century and a half, from the arrival of Gil de Arag√≥n until the date of the founding of Talca. Company of Jesus in the Villa Governor Manso de Velasco gave all the facilities to the new order of the Jesuits to settle throughout the kingdom of Chile. In Talca, donations of land for their respective settlement. The decree of June 10, 1748, which authorized its establishment, imposed on them the obligation to found schools. The Order was very well received and its first superior, Fray Jos√© Guzm√°n. Thus they made rich lands that exceeded 1,000 (cuadras) blocks of extension. The richest people in the city led by the Genoese Juan de la Cruz y Bernardotte and his wife Silveria Bahamonde y Herrera, who were the great protectors of the Jesuits. Mrs. Francisca Gonz√°lez Bruna, widow of Don Agust√≠n de Molina y Narveja, was also a great devotee of the order, in whose bosom her son Juan Ignacio Molina, the famous naturalist and historian, professed. Portrait of Pedro Nolasco Vergara Albano (1800 - 1867) They built their church, whose work was helped by Juan de la Cruz y Bernardotte, who had some knowledge of architecture, and had arrived in the new city brought from Concepci√≥n by Governor Manso de Velasco, who found him among the crew of the squadron of El Admiral Pizarro, to teach Talca's neighbors how to build their houses. The Genoese helped with 500 pesos for the expenses and with architectural works to the Jesuits. The order had to suffer the misfortune of seeing the recent construction surrounded by the flames, but indefatigable and encouraged by the cooperation of the Genoese, they raised it again, more splendid, full of images and with rich ornamentation The children of the richest neighbors were educated in this first school, they were called the College of Nobles, for the quality of the students. The children of his protectors, Juan, Vicente, Juan Manuel, Anselmo and Isidoro Cruz y Bahamonde, were his first students, and the brothers Jos√© Antonio and Juan Ignacio Molina, the famous naturalist and historian, also studied there. There the future Abate Molina received his first lessons from these religious. As he was of a privileged intelligence, he could soon, at an early age, with the authorization of his teachers, also teach the first letters. He had a group of students among whom were Don Vicente de la Cruz y Bahamonde, his brothers Faustino, Jacinto, Juan Esteban, Juan Manuel, Ignacio, Anselmo de la Cruz y Bahamonde, Juan and Nicol√°s, Bernardo O'Higgins, Ignacio and Dionisio . Brisio de Opazo y Castro, Francisco Olivares y Rojas, Ram√≥n Ram√≠rez, Pedro Nolasco Vergara Albano, Juan Diego, Casimiro, Nicol√°s and Carlos Manuel Albano Cruz. All these young people received lessons, from the age of seven. After the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Kingdom and, therefore, from Talca, education was in charge of the Cabildo, which paid a master of first letters 150 pesos annually. On April 8, 1793, this corporation agreed to lease a house for a seminar where to educate young people. This establishment had been running for years, since Don Ambrosio O'Higgins, who visited Talca in that year, says that in them, he taught the first letters and Latinity, where young people attend. Royal cedula of his majesty the king of Spain, who grants the title of the city Don Carlos IV, on behalf of June 14, 1794, accompanied by a testimony, said that the president of the Royal Auxiliary of Chile, Don Ambrosio O'Higgins, so hereafter referred to the Villa of San Agust√≠n de Talca mentioned above, can be called City, being placed in all the Letters, Provisions and Privileges issued by this king and by my successors.

As of 2020, Barrett has released one studio album, two EPs and one live album under the Giles Corey name. History When speaking of his plans for the debut album, Barrett said \\"Giles Corey as a project started off very differently from where it ended. Initially, I was just wondering if I could write country and western songs, and sort of turn folk music into something that sounded like it came from me. I put restrictions on the kinds of instruments I could use, and so on. That kind of faded away as the record took on a life of its own\\" as well as \\"Giles Corey was meant to have no electronic instruments (though I broke that rule) and to be influenced by country music, and the songwriting style grew out of that\\". Barrett makes frequent use of sampling in the project. The self-titled album, Giles Corey, was released on March 1st, 2011 to critical acclaim and is a favourite amongst fans of Barrett's work. The album has been described as \\"a deeply, intensely dark album of inner turmoil\\". Alongside it a book was released of the same name. It is an exploration of cult leader Robert Voor and Barrett's own stories of depression and suicide. It continues the story of the accompanying book to Deathconsciousness. It was described by Barrett as \\"an intensely personal, intimate portrait of depression\\". The song \\"Empty Churches\\" features a sample of a documentary monologue discussing ghosts and radio transmissions. Sam An of electronic music project Lana Del Rabies chose the album as one of five that changed her life. On August 25, 2012, they released their first extended play (EP), Deconstructionist. The EP, unlike the previous, was solely ambient music, described by Barrett as \\"designed to induce trances, possession states, and out-of-body experiences\\". Barrett was inspired by \\"ritual trance\\" while making the EP. Musically, the EP is composed of binaural beats. Phill Cameron described the EP as \\"disconcerting racket\\" that \\"instead of feeling claustrophobic\\" feels \\"almost lonely; every sound echoes, as if in a huge space, and the constant pressure of electronic beats adds a sense of desperate urgency to the music. It's unsettling and uncomfortable.\\" The EP was accompanied by a thirty-page primer. The second song, \\"Infinite Death\\" features a pitch shifted sample of Yale philosophy professor Shelly Kagan and discusses \\"our inability to properly imagine our own deaths.\\" It was chosen by the Independent as the fourth most chilling song of all time. It was followed by their second extended play (EP) released on 21 February 2013 titled Hinterkaifeck. Lastly, it was followed by a live album, Live in the Middle of Nowhere, released February 27th, 2013. The album was recorded at the Enemies List Home Recordings Warehouse in Meriden, CT and features accompaniment from Flenser labelmate Thom Wasluck, who played the keyboard on \\"Earthmover\\". In 2020, Barret was set to perform at the Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands as Giles Corey in celebration of The Flenser's 10th anniversary. This performance would have been the first time project had been played as a full-band with Have a Nice Life band member Tim Macuga accompanying him.

Wachter has said that she was inspired to work in technology because of her grandmother, who was one of three women admitted to the Austrian technical university. She completed her Master of Law in 2009, before starting as a legal counsel in the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health. During this time she joined the faculty at the University of Vienna, where she started a doctoral degree in technology, intellectual property and regulation. She completed her PhD in 2015, and simultaneously earned a master's degree in social sciences at the University of Oxford. After earning her doctorate Wachter joined the Royal Academy of Engineering, where she worked in public policy. She returned to the University of Vienna where she worked on the ethical aspects of innovation.  Research and career  Her work covers legal and ethical issues associated with Big Data, AI, algorithms and data protection. She believes that there needs to be a balance between technical innovation and personal control of information. Wachter was made a Research Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute in 2016. In this capacity she has evaluated the ethical and legal aspects of data science. She has argued that artificial intelligence should be more transparent and accountable, and that people have a \\"right to reasonable inferences\\". She has highlighted cases where opaque algorithms have become racist and sexist; such as discrimination in applications to St George's Hospital and Medical School in the 1970s and overestimations of black defendants reoffending when using the program COMPAS. Whilst Wachter appreciates that it is difficult to eliminate bias from training data sets, she believes that is possible to develop tools to identify and eliminate them. She has looked at ways to audit artificial intelligence to tackle discrimination and promote fairness. In this capacity she has argued that Facebook should continue to use human moderators. She has argued that General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in need of reform, as despite attention being paid to the input stage, less time is spent on how the data is assessed. She believes that privacy must mean more than data protection, focussing on data evaluation and ways for people to control how information about them is stored and shared. Working with Brent Mittelstadt and Chris Russell, Wachter suggested counterfactual explanations ‚Äì statements of how different the world would be to result in a different outcome. When decisions are made by an algorithm it can be difficult for people to understand why they are being made, especially without revealing trade secrets about an algorithm. Counterfactual explanations would permit the interrogation of algorithms without the need to reveal secrets. The approach of using counterfactual explanations was adopted by Google on What If, a feature on TensorBoard, a Google Open Source web application that uses machine learning. Counterfactual explanations without opening the black box: automated decisions and the GDPR, a paper written by Wachter, Brent Mittelstadt and Chris Russell, has been featured by the press and is widely cited in scholarly literature. = Academic service = She was made an associate professor at the University of Oxford in 2019.

Carmel is a Roman Catholic church in Bayonne, New Jersey. The name is a dedication to the Blessed Virgin Mary in her role as patroness of the Carmelite Order, hence the name Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Founded by Polish immigrants in 1898, it grew to become one the largest Polish congregation in the United States. Part of the Archdiocese of Newark, the parish merged with two others to become the Parish of St. John Paul II in 2016. Early history Following years-long effort by early Polish immigrants in Bayonne to form a parish of their own, the church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Bayonne was officially incorporated on January 25, 1898 by Bishop Winand Michael Wigger.Sinclair, Gladys Mellor.

Boleslaus Kwiatkowski, Pastor of St. Anthony of Padua Parish in Jersey City, NJ. Rev. Alexis John Iwan√≥w, a priest of nineteen years, arrived in Bayonne in August 1899 and was officially appointed Pastor of Mt. Carmel Parish on November 9, 1899. The parish initially held religious services in the basement chapel of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, the first R.C. parish established in Bayonne. At the time of Mt. Carmel's founding, the other Roman Catholic parishes in Bayonne were St. Mary's (1861) St. Vincent's (1894), St. Henry's (German, 1889) and St. Joseph's (Slovak). The Parish secured land on East 22nd Street where the Polish parishioners built the simple wooden chapel by hand (after working in the local industries).Sinclair, Gladys Mellor.

Iwan√≥w and under the threatened use of firearms they carried with them, demanded control of the parish. With the pastor banished, some 300 parishioners occupied the church, inspired by fears that the church property, funded and built by parishioners, was legally owned by the Bishop, and not the parishioners. 20th century history A new pastor, Rev. Sigismund ≈öwider, was appointed following Rev. Iwan√≥w's departure. With the church occupied, Rev. ≈öwider oversaw the construction of a new church nearby. On April 16, 1901, a Bill of Complaint was filed in the Chancery Division of the New Jersey Superior Court contesting the legal ownership of the original church property. The decree of October 26, 1903 recognized the legality of the claim of Our Lady of Mount Carmel parish to the church property, and the church was returned to the Roman Catholic congregation.

He ensured that the law that freed the slaves was enforced, and supported the black leader Toussaint Louverture, who later established the independent republic of Haiti. After the Bourbon Restoration he was Deputy for Sa√¥ne-et-Loire from 1820 to 1823. Early years Etienne Mayneaud Bizefranc de Laveaux was born on 8 August 1751 in Digoin, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, France. He was descended from an ancient and noble Burgundian family. His father was Hugues, lord of Bizefranc, Laveaux and Pancemont (1716‚Äì1781), Receiver of the King's Farms. His mother was Marie- Jeanne de Baudoin. He was the third of six children born between 1749 and 1756. As was customary for a younger son, he joined the army, entering the 16th dragoons at the age of 17. His military career was mundane. He seems to have often lived in Paray-le-Monial, near his birthplace. That is where he married Marie-Jacobie-Sophie de Guillermin, daughter of a local aristocrat, in 1784. Revolutionary period =Military leader= Haiti, formerly Saint- Domingue. Cap-Fran√ßais is now called Cap-Ha√Øtien The French Revolution began in 1789. Laveaux was promoted to squadron leader in 1790, and became a general councillor for Sa√¥ne-et-Loire that year. In 1791 he was implicated in a counterfeit money affair, but was cleared of all suspicion and acquitted. He arrived in Saint-Domingue on 19 September 1792 with the civil commissioners L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax and √âtienne Polverel as lieutenant-colonel in command of a detachment of 200 men of the 16th regiment of dragoons. The commissioners found that many of the white planters were hostile to the increasingly radical revolutionary movement and were joining the royalist opposition. The commissioners announced that they did not intend to abolish slavery, but had come to ensure that free men had equal rights whatever their color. In October news arrived that the king had been suspended and France was now a republic. Laveaux was placed in charge of the northwest part of the colony, based in Port-de-Paix. His commander, General Rochambeau, praised his conduct in taking the fort of Ouanaminthe on the Spanish border in the northeast, which was being held by black slaves in revolt. The city of Cap Fran√ßais (Cap-Ha√Øtien) at this time was in turmoil. Some of the troops helped the white settlers restore the slave order in the city, while others, particularly those under Laveaux, supported the civil commissioners and wanted to protect the mulattoes, a prime target of the planters. Laveaux was promoted to the command of the Northern province. In January 1793 Laveux led a force that included free-colored troops against slave insurgents in the town of Milot and drove them back into the mountains. That month Louis XVI was executed in Paris, and in February Spain and Britain declared war on France. In May or June 1793 the black rebel leader Toussaint Louverture contacted Laveaux and proposed \\"avenues of reconciliation\\", but Laveaux rejected his offer. Cap-Fran√ßais burning during Galbaud's revolt Fran√ßois-Thomas Galbaud du Fort was appointed Governor General of Saint-Domingue on 6 February 1793 in place of Jean-Jacques d'Esparbes. He reached Cap-Fran√ßais (Cap-Ha√Øtien) on 7 May 1793. On 8 May 1793 he wrote a letter to Polv√©rel and Sonthonax announcing his arrival. The commissioners arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais on 10 June 1793, where they were welcomed by the colored people but received a cold reception from the whites. They heard that Galbaud was friendly with the faction that was hostile to the commission, and did not intend to obey them. Polv√©rel and Sonthonax dismissed him on 13 June 1793 and ordered him to embark on the Normande and return to France. They made Laveaux acting governor in his place. On the 20 June 1793 Galbaud proclaimed that he was resuming office and called for assistance in expelling the civil commissioners. He landed at 3:30 p.m. at the head of 3,000 men, who met no resistance at first. A confused struggle followed between the sailors and white settlers in support of Galbaud, and European troops, mulattoes and insurgent blacks in support of the commissioners. On 21 June 1793 the commissioners proclaimed that all blacks who would fight for them against the Spanish and other enemies would be freed. The black insurgents joined the white and mulatto forces and drove the sailors out of the city on 22‚Äì23 June. Galbaud left with the fleet bound for the United States on 24‚Äì25 June. Commissioner Sonthonax proclaimed universal freedom on 29 August 1793. A month later the first British troops landed in Saint-Domingue, to be welcomed by royalist white planters and troops. =Governor of Saint-Domingue= L√©ger- F√©licit√© Sonthonax Laveaux was appointed governor general in an acting role until the French government confirmed Sonthonax's choice. He was governor of Saint-Domingue during a crucial period of its history. The former governor de la Salle left the colony spouting invective against the commissioners. He thought that collective enfranchisement of slaves was much worse than treason, as did all the whites and many of the mulattoes. In October 1793 Sonthonax left Port-de-Paix for Port-au-Prince, taking all his staff and funds, and leaving Laveaux in charge. Laveaux was now isolated with a force of 1,700 men in Port-de-Paix. The people of the town were largely hostile, and the country people were rebellious. The black troops under Pierrot were very reluctant to recognize his authority, and the white troops petitioned to be repatriated to France. The mulatto Jean Villatte was defending Cap-Fran√ßais and Fort-Dauphin (Fort-Libert√©) against the Spanish. Sonthonax was having great difficulty maintaining his authority in Port-R√©publicain, formerly Port-au-Prince. Rigaud was defending J√©r√©mie and Les Cayes in the south. Laveaux made contact with the French charg√© d'affaires in Charleston, South Carolina, who supplied some food and powder at the end of 1793. With much difficulty he managed to get the planters to start paying the former slaves to work. In the spring of 1794 Laveaux reported some military success in the northwest peninsula, and that the economy was starting up again. The French government's decree of 16 Pluvi√¥se an II (4 February 1794) freed the slaves, and news of this historic event reached Saint-Domingue in May 1794. On 5 May 1794 Laveaux sent a letter to Louverture asking him to leave the Spanish and join the French Republicans. Louverture accepted in his reply of 18 May 1794. On 24 May 1794 Laveaux wrote to Polverel that \\"Toussaint Louverture, one of the three chiefs of the African royalists, in coalition with the Spanish Government, has at last discovered his true interests and that of his brothers; he has realized that kings can never be the friends of liberty; he fights today for the Republic at the head of an armed force.\\" Laveaux and Toussaint met for the first time on 8 August 1794, and immediately became good friends. From then on, each would often praise and support the other. Toussaint L'Ouverture c. 1800 With Louverture's change of allegiance, the line of military posts from Gona√Øves to the border with Spanish Santo Domingo came under French control, greatly improving their position with respect to the British to the south of that line. Laveaux was able to move from his confined position at Port-de-Paix to the northern capital of Cap Fran√ßais (Cap-Ha√Øtien), now a mulatto stronghold under Jean Villatte. The British decided to impose British laws in their part of Saint Domingue, including racially discriminatory laws, and the free-coloreds in the area began to turn against them. Laveaux told them they would be better off under Republican rule, and also warned the free-colored in Saint-Marc that if they did not surrender he would tell Louverture to sack the town, only sparing the \\"former slaves\\". Alexandre Lebas and Victor Hugues, the commissioners of Guadeloupe, heard of the Thermidor upheavals (July 1794) in which the Jacobins lost power. They hastened to affirm their non-partisan loyalty to the Republic. They pointed out that in Guadeloupe they had accomplished the liberation of the slaves without trouble, whereas in Saint-Domingue most of the former slaves had abandoned the plantations and the situation was still disturbed. Laveaux had also failed to expel the British from Saint-Domingue. The commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel returned to Paris to answer charges from the exiled planters concerning their emancipation decree. When Sonthonax left the colony, Laveaux became the most senior of the French leaders. After Rochambeau capitulated in Martinique, Laveaux was completely isolated in the Caribbean. When Toussaint changed sides he brought 4,000 seasoned and disciplined soldiers, and these contributed to the series of victories in 1795. The government in France was impressed, and Sonthonax and Polverel were fully exonerated. Laveaux was promoted to divisional general on 25 May 1795. In July 1795 the National Convention praised the army of Saint-Domingue and its governor Laveaux. As governor Laveaux ensured that the abolition of slavery proclaimed on 4 February 1794 was put into effect, and organized the integration of former slaves into the republican society of Saint-Domingue. On 22 Vendemiaire, year IV (14 October 1795) he was appointed to the Council of Ancients as deputy for Saint-Domingue. Jean Villatte, the mulatto general in command of the northern military department, attempted a coup against Laveaux, and imprisoned him and his aides-de-camp on 20 March 1796. A week later Toussaint marched on Cap-Fran√ßais and freed him. In return Laveaux appointed Toussaint Lieutenant-General to the Government of Saint-Domingue. =Return to France= Later in 1796 Louverture suggested that as Saint-Domingue's deputy in the French National Convention, Laveaux should return to France to fight the growing pro-slavery lobby in Paris. Laveaux agreed, and left the island in October 1796. In the Conseil des Anciens Laveaux was active in promoting Neo- Jacobin ideas within the framework of the bourgeois republic. He believed in equal rights for all, and wanted the French constitution to apply equally to the colonies. In February 1799 on the fifth anniversary of the act that liberated the slaves, Laveaux proclaimed: On 24 Germinal year VII (13 April 1799) Laveaux was unanimously reelected to the Council of Ancients for the department of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire with 248 votes. Laveaux defended all political societies, particularly the Salle du Man√®ge in August 1799. Directory and Empire Ch√¢teau de Cormatin Laveaux was appointed the government's agent in Guadeloupe on 31 August 1799. His mission was then changed, and in October 1799 he was to go to Saint-Domingue, but he did not reach that island. By order of Napoleon he was arrested on 1 March 1800. On the way back he was captured by the English on 4 March 1800. The First Consul Napoleon dismissed Laveaux from office in 1801. Under the First French Empire Laveaux was not active in public, although he was appointed commander of the National Guard of Besan√ßon. During this period of forced retirement he acquired the Ch√¢teau de Cormatin, which he renovated. Deputy Under the second Bourbon Restoration, in the second legislature Laveaux was deputy for the department of Sa√¥ne-et- Loire from 4 November 1820 to 24 December 1823. He represented the first district of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire (M√¢con). He sat on the left, voted with the constitutional opposition, and vigorously defended the rights of the old army. Laveaux died in the Ch√¢teau de Cormatin on 12 May 1828, in Cormatin, Sa√¥ne-et- Loire. A commemorative plaque at the entrance to Cormatin Castle says that General Laveaux played a vital role in the insurrection of the slaves of Saint-Domingue that was followed by the first victory of a slave revolt leading to the creation of the first black republic in history with Haiti on 1 January 1804. His voluminous correspondence with Toussaint-Louverture has been preserved and is a major source of information for historians of the period.

On IMDb, the show is currently rated 5.0 stars. The Daily Dot had unfavorably compared the series to Punk'd and criticized the reactions, stating \\"Netflix's Prank Encounters is a riff on Punk'd, but it doesn't do anything to set itself apart.

It was originally built between 1315 and 1321 CE by amir Sunqur Sa'di. Sunqur was forced to leave Egypt in his lifetime and was never buried there, but a sheikh known as Hasan Sadaqa was later buried in it and therefore the building is often known by his name. From the 17th century onward the complex was converted into Mevlevi Sufi lodge (a takkiya, or more specifically a mawlawiyya) and is open today as the Mawlawiyya Museum or Museo Mevlevi.  History  = Foundation and construction in the Mamluk period = alt= Amir Sunqur Sa'di was the commander of the \\"royal mamluks\\" under Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, and a secretary of the army (na'ib al-jaysh). Al- Nasir's reign marked the peak of Cairo's prosperity in the medieval era, and a significant amount of construction took place at this time. The area northwest of the Citadel, in particular, was a previously sparsely-occupied district which was developed into a royal quarter with many palaces and mosques constructed by, or for, his most important amirs (Mamluk commanders or state officials). Between 1315 and 1321 CE (715-721 AH), Sunqur Sa'di built a madrasa (possibly intended as a khanqah), a convent (ribat) for women, and a mausoleum for himself. However, he later became involved in a quarrel with one of the most powerful amirs of his time, Amir Qawsun, whose monumental palace, built between 1330 and 1337, was located right next to the site of Sunqur's madrasa. Qawsun forced him to leave Egypt and flee to Tripoli (Lebanon) in 1323 and, as a result, he was never buried in his mausoleum. A contemporary sheikh by the name of Hasan Sadaqa was buried there instead. However, there is some uncertainty as to whether the mausoleum was intended to be dedicated to Hasan Sadaqa's tomb from the beginning. The cenotaph over Hasan Sadaqa's tomb cites Sunqur as the founder of the building, but states that the building is the shrine (darih) of Hasan Sadaqa himself. This would seem to suggest that Sunqur dedicated the building to Hasan Sadaqa, but this would be unusual in Mamluk architectural history and it seems unlikely that a high-ranking Mamluk amir would construct such an impressive mausoleum and religious complex with no intention to use it for himself. Elsewhere, Hasan Sadaqa is described in historical sources as a wealthy notable, possibly a merchant, who sponsored the building, while his own cenotaph describes him as a Sufi (Islamic mystic) sheikh. To add to the confusion, the cenotaph is dated to 1315, well before Sunqur fled Egypt (1323) and before the mausoleum's completion (1321), while other sources give his date of death as 1345, well after Sunqur had left. One possible interpretation is that Hasan Sadaqa was a Sufi sheikh with great wealth who co-sponsored the foundation and construction of Sunqur's building, and thus at some point was granted the privilege of sharing the mausoleum with Sunqur. If so, this arrangement would nonetheless be unusual in Mamluk architectural traditions, but the question remains unresolved. = Later history and use as a Mevlevi Sufi lodge = 275x275px The Mevlevi Sufi order (the followers of Jalal al-Din Rumi, known in the Western world simply as \\"Rumi\\"), which originated in Turkey, likely arrived in Cairo thanks to Egypt's integration into the Ottoman Empire after 1517. In 1607 the grounds of the madrasa and part of the ruins of Qawsun's palace were given over to the Mevlevi Sufi order as a donation from a Yemeni Ottoman pasha called Yusuf Sinan. It was part of a larger donation which included three other plots of land in Cairo and in other locations in the Nile Delta region. The Mevlevis adapted the site for use as a lodge (a takkiya or mawlawiyya) for their order. The original donation by Yusuf Sinan is well-documented and even contained instructions for the establishment's staff and their salaries: these included an imam, a muezzin, and 38 people required for performing the sama' (whirling dervish), along with maintenance staff. A theatre or ceremonial hall for the performance of the sama' was built in 1810 on top of the former courtyard of the original madrasa, with painted decoration dated to 1857. New tombs for the order's Sufi sheikhs were added in or near the original mausoleum over time. The Mevlevis remained here until 1945, but the building is no longer used as a Sufi lodge today. Excavations and restorations on the site started in the 1970s, led by an Italian team. This led to the building being reopened in July 1988 as a small museum known as the Mawlawiyya (or Mevlevi) Museum, or Museo Mevlevi, exhibiting the historical remains and the restored Mevlevi lodge.  Description  The madrasa structure itself only partially remains today, as the Mevlevi order built their facilities on top of it. The mausoleum and the sama' ceremonial hall are in better shape and have been restored in recent times. = The Mamluk-era structure = The detailed stucco decoration on the mausoleum exterior. The mausoleum chamber, with muqarnas squinches and Arabic inscriptions in stucco. Most of the inscriptions are from the Maqama of al- Hariri, rather than from the Qur'an. The building's entrance from the street is through a doorway under a canopy of stone-carved decorations, including . To the left is the mausoleum and the former madrasa, marked by a dome and minaret at the building's corner. The exterior surface of the mausoleum dome, as well as the exterior of the minaret, are covered in lavish carved stucco decoration that is considered uncommon in Mamluk architecture. The minaret's overall shape is typical of the Bahri Mamluk period, with a square shaft and a fluted cap with a keel-arch profile (similar to the minaret of the Mausoleum of Salar and Sanjar al-Jawli). Inside, the madrasa's remains are located beneath the 19th-century Sufi lodge's theatre. The walls of the madrasa are made of ablaq (two-coloured) stone, around a central courtyard (sahn) around which were large iwans (vaulted chambers open on one side) and multiple smaller rooms. Only the northwest iwan remains today, adjacent to the mausoleum chamber. In the central courtyard are the remains of a fountain with a lobed profile, excavated during modern restorations, which dates back to the Tulunid period in the 9th century. In another corner, an even older well (dating from before 850 CE) was also discovered. The mausoleum chamber is under the northwestern dome (visible from the street), at the structure's northern corner, and contains the cenotaph of Hasan Sadaqa. It is 7.8 by 8.4 meters, meaning it is not quite square, and the dome above is slightly elliptic as a consequence. The squinches (the transition zones between the round dome and the square chamber) are composed of pendentives with muqarnas forms, with colored glass windows in between. The chamber's decoration otherwise consists of carved stucco bands containing Arabic inscriptions, on arabesque backgrounds, running along the walls. One extraordinary feature of this mausoleum is the fact that these lengthy inscriptions are not from the Qur'an or any other religious text. Instead, they are excerpts from the Maqamat al-Hariri, a collection of stories by the poet al-Hariri which describe the adventures of a vagabond and trickster, Abu Zayd, who travels and relies on his wits and eloquence to survive. Although the Maqamat al-Hariri is valued as a work of Arabic literature and appears to have been popular with the Egyptian Mamluks of Sunqur's era, the decision to include this type of text instead of Qur'anic verses or other religious selections is considered bold and unusual. It may be that Sunqur was a connoisseur of literature, or that he simply had eccentric tendencies, which manifested here. The only Qur'anic inscription in the mausoleum is a short circular inscription of the Throne Verse at the apex of the dome. The rooms of the women's convent (ribat) which Sunqur Sa'di built are now offices for the Italian-Egyptian Center for Restoration and Archaeology, which restored the building and opened the museum. The grounds also include a garden which was part of Qawsun's palace next-door but integrated into the precinct by the Mevlevis.275x275px = The 19th-century Mevlevi Sufi lodge = The Sufi ritual hall/theatre, known as a sama'khana (Arabic, \\"House of Listening\\") or semahane (Turkish), is made largely of wood, in an architectural style reminiscent of late Ottoman baroque. It is built above the former madrasa's courtyard. The hall is square (dimensions: 15 by 15 meters) but is centered around a wide circular floor (diameter: 10.65 meters), under another wide dome, where the whirling dervish dance (sama') was performed. The floor is surrounded on all sides by a two- storied gallery, though the old northwest iwan is still accessible on one side. The theatre's current structure was built in 1810 while the decoration dates from 1857. The decoration includes scenes of landscapes, gardens, and birds painted under the dome, plus a circular Arabic inscription at the dome's apex.

He served in the federal government from 1874 to 1904 as federal surveyor and administrator, as federal advisor for western development and as Western consultant for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. As Inspector of Dominion Lands Agencies, he oversaw the \\"development and allocation of all land, forests, mineral and water resources\\" from \\"Winnipeg to the eastern foothills of the Rockies\\"‚Äîrepresenting 400,000 square miles of land, earning his nickname‚Äî\\"Czar of the West\\". He was known for his work on the Bow River watershed irrigation systems that transformed lands in southern Alberta into fertile land. Pearce moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1884 and after retiring from public service, worked for the CPR as statistician. A year before he died he donated his estate to the City of Calgary. The Pearce Estate Wetland is an urban park. Pearce \\"believed in urban parks\\" and he \\"is the reason so much of the Bow remains accessible\\" to the public as it runs through the city core. Early years William Pearce was born near Port Talbot, Dunwich Township, Elgin County, Ontario on February 1, 1848.The Glenbow Museum William Pearce family fonds archives includes documents related to the funding and \\"construction of the Calgary General Hospital (1890-1903); his articles on the Riel Rebellion, National Parks, irrigation, CPR, and oil.\\"report to the Economic and Development Commission on development of the West (1916); a genealogy of the Pearce family; architectural plans for the Pearce home (1888); survey plan of proposed irrigation ditch (1896).\\" His parents, John Pearce and Elizabeth Moorhouse, were United Empire Loyalists. Education He studied engineering for one semester at the University of Toronto. In 1869, he began a three-year surveying apprenticeship with the Toronto-based Wadsworth and Unwing, working in the woods of northern Ontario. This experienced \\"inspired his life-long interest in natural resource and wilderness development.\\" In October 1872 he was certified as a Province of Ontario Land Surveyor. Professional life ;Early career In 1873, with Wadsworth and Unwin, he worked on the \\"challenging Thousand Island survey project running surveys across open water and ice on the shores of the St. Lawrence River.\\" =Federal surveyor and administrator (1874-1884)= In 1873, Canada's first Surveyor General, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, hired Pearce for the newly-created Dominion Department of the Interior, established to \\"absorb the vast North American regions of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territories.\\" The Rupert's Land Act 1868 resulted in the transfer of Rupert's Land from the control of the Hudson's Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada‚Äîrepresenting the largest land purchase in Canada's history, which was consummated in 1870. In 1873, the federal government created the Department of the Interior‚Äîa \\"single department administrative jurisdiction\\" over all First Nations and Metis land, and all public lands west of Ontario. Pearce's professional career as federal surveyor in these years following the land acquisition, was inextricably linked to the \\"strategies to assert Canadian sovereignty and control over this vast region\\", strategies that \\"were foundation stones of federal policy.\\" He worked for the Canadian Department of the Interior for thirty years, from 1874 to 1904. ;Northwest Territories (1874-1881) As Inspector of Agencies on the Dominion Lands Board, he \\"was in charge of investigating all land claims (mostly Metis) from the Red River to the Rockies.\\" His first posting was in Winnipeg in May 1874. He worked in a climate of \\"shifting settlements, squatting, and rampant land speculation\\" involving the Metis, newly arrived settlers, and land speculators. Under the 1870 Manitoba Act, Metis settlers had \\"outer two miles\\" access,\\" which referred to access to hay two miles beyond their defined holdings to feed their livestock.\\" As Inspector, he oversaw the \\"development and allocation of all land, forests, mineral and water resources\\" from \\"Winnipeg to the eastern foothills of the Rockies\\"‚Äîrepresenting 400,000 square miles of land. With such influence, he earned the nickname the \\"Czar of the West\\". On October 21, 1880, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) signed an agreement with the federal government to build a 1,900 mile-railway from Kamloops, British Columbia to Callander, Ontario. The railway was to receive \\"$25 million and 25 million acres of land 'fairly fit for settlement.'\\" By 1884, just before he stepped down from his position as Inspector of Agencies on the Dominion Lands Board, \\"land claims protest had reached such a level that he was charged to address all outstanding land claims disputes across the Prairies south of the North Saskatchewan River.\\" During the 1887 federal election, Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Liberal Party told the House of Commons that federal surveyors had \\"mishandled western settlement\\" and blamed the \\"poor administration of Metis land claims\\" for the 1885 North-West Rebellion by the M√©tis people under Louis Riel against the government of Canada. In response to a request by Thomas White, the Minister of the Interior, Pearce submitted a detailed report in 1886 defending the work of the surveyors. Printed by MacLean, Roger & Co. =Federal advisor for western development policy (1884-1904)= In 1883, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald appointed Pearce to chair a special Lands Board Investigation Commission to resolve the growing discontent in Prairie settlements. In 1884, Surveyor General Lindsay Russell promoted Pearce to the position of Superintendent of Mines in Calgary, Alberta, reported directly to the Deputy Minister. In both these administrative positions, Pearce influenced federal \\"policies for development of land, mineral, water, and timber resources in the North-West Territories.\\" From 1884 until his death in 1930, Pearce and his family lived in Calgary.

Pearce began lobbying for the formation of an Albertan provincial surveyors association in 1905. When the 1910 Alberta Land Surveyors' Act was passed, he was elected in 1911 as the Alberta Land Surveyor Association's first president. During World War I, Pearce was asked to work in Ottawa as an national adviser on western resources. He was praised by Prime Minister Robert Borden for the 800-page report he submitted to the 1916 Royal Commission on Economics and Development. Father of Irrigation in Alberta John Stoughton Dennis, Chief Inspector of Surveys visited the United States to study irrigation laws and practices and reported his findings to the Canadian parliament, in which he recommended the passage of the Northwest Irrigation Act and cited the advocacy work of William Pearce.

On 7 October 2015 he was again tonsured by Kirill, this time with the manel with the name of Anthony after Anthony of Rome. = In Italy = From 22 March to 30 May 2011, he served as the leading clergyman of the parish of St. Nicholas Stavropegic in Rome, Italy. From 30 May to 12 June 2011 he served as the leading clergyman of the Stavropegial Church in honor of St. Catherine the Great Martyr also in Rome. On 12 June 2011 he was appointed secretary of the parishes of the Moscow Patriarchate in Italy, and elevated to the rank of Archimandrite by Patriarch Kirill. During his time in Rome, Anthony said that he felt rather lonely as for the first time in his life he was living for a prolonged period of time in a place where Russian Orthodox made a small percentage of the population. Before and during his time in Rome the Orthodox community in Italy had grown to over 50 parishes, mostly due to immigration to Italy from Orthodox populations in Eastern Europe and to a lesser extent by converts. During the same time the Romanian Orthodox community in Italy grew to 163 parishes. Despite feeling uneasy at times, Anthony said that there are many similarities between Italians and Russians in tradition and customs, so the transition to being a pastor in Italy was not hard culturally. = Metropolitan of Chersonesus and Western Europe = On 30 May 2019, Anthony succeeded John (Roshchin) as the primate of the Patriarchal Exarchate in Western Europe (Moscow Patriarchate), after the Holy Synod of the ROC decided to appoint him and to appoint John (Roshchin) as primate of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Vienna and Austria. As a result, Anthony became the Metropolitan bishop of the Russian Orthodox Diocese of Chersonesus and Patriarchal exarch in Western Europe, and the locum tenens of the Patriarchal parishes in Italy. Views on ecumenism Having spent most of his pastoral career in predominantly Roman Catholic areas, Anthony has stated that it is important for the two churches to have good relations, especially in areas where both Orthodox and Catholic faithful worship. At the Roman Catholic Basilica di San Nicola, a shrine to St. Nicholas the Wonderworker in Bari, he would lead Divine Liturgy on Thursdays. He has thanked the Catholic church in Italy for its tolerant view of the Orthodox population there and for occasionally allowing Orthodox to pray in Catholic shrines dedicated to saints that both churches venerate. He said that it is important that Orthodox worshippers do not pray together with Catholics or attend Catholic Mass, as the two churches are not in full communion with one another, and there are still theological differences between the two.

Cox, Jr. Jerome Rockhold Cox, Jr. (born May 24, 1925) is an American computer pioneer, scientist, and entrepreneur. He contributed significantly to the areas of biomedical computing, multimedia communications, and computer networking. He was the founding chairman of the Department of Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis. He is a senior professor emeritus of Computer Science at Washington University (1999 -), as well as Founder and President of Blendics, Inc., (2007 -) and Q-Net Security. Inc (2015 -). In 1998, Cox collaborated with colleagues Jonathan S. Turner and Guru Parulkar in founding Growth Networks (acquired by Cisco Systems in 2000). Cox is responsible for bringing the Laboratory INstrument Computer, known as LINC ‚Äì along with its development team including Wesley A. Clark, Severo Ornstein, and Charles Molnar ‚Äì to Washington University in 1964. LINC, which was developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs Lincoln Laboratory in 1962, is a contender for the title of the first personal computer because it can be managed by a single individual.  Early life and education  Cox was born in Washington, D.C. in May 1925. Six years later, his parents, Jerome R. Cox, Sr., and Jane Mills Cox moved to South Bend, Indiana, where he grew up and learned to love mathematics. Cox gravitated to his professional path at a young age. When he was 11 years old, he secretly took apart his radio to see how it worked. After serving in the U.S. Army from 1943‚Äì1944, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned bachelor's (1947), master's (1949), and doctoral degrees (1954) in electrical engineering, with an emphasis in acoustics. Career = Liberty Mutual Research Institute = Cox began his career in 1952 as the director of the now-shuttered Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. His research centered on industrial noise exposure and the potential impact on worker hearing loss. This work included the first longitudinal study of audiometric histories of employees in industrial noise. = Central Institute for the Deaf = In 1955, Cox was recruited by Hallowell Davis to leave Boston and come to Central Institute for the Deaf in St. Louis. Davis, Director of Research at CID, challenged Cox to implement an idea for measuring hearing in infants. In 1961, Cox and his graduate student, A. M Engrebretson, designed and built a special-purpose digital computer used by Davis to pioneer the field of early detection of deafness. This research has since led to mandated screening tests for newborn infants throughout the United States. =Biomedical Computer Laboratory/Computer Systems Laboratory at Washington University Medical School = In 1964, Cox founded the Biomedical Computer Laboratory, an organization dedicated to the introduction of small computers to biomedical research. His pioneering work in radiation treatment planning paved the way for systems in worldwide operation. His research team developed computer methods for reconstructing images from CT and PET scannersthat aid in the diagnosis of cancers and cardiovascular disease. His innovations were instrumental in developing early monitors for heart rhythm disturbances. He also worked on computer applications in mapping the human genome and in electronic radiology. In 1964, Cox brought the LINC (the Laboratory INstrument Computer) and its development team to Washington University from MIT‚Äôs Lincoln Laboratory. This team included Wesley A. Clark, Severo Ornstein, and Charles Molnar. The LINC is considered by some to be the first minicomputer, and a forerunner to the personal computer. The New York Times series on the history of the personal computer had this to say in an article on August 19, 2001, \\"How the Computer Became Personal\\": \\"In the pantheon of personal computing, the LINC, in a sense, came first, more than a decade before Ed Roberts made PC‚Äôs affordable for ordinary people. Work started on the Linc, the brainchild of the M.I.T. physicist Wesley A. Clark, in May 1961. Each Linc had a tiny screen and keyboard and comprised four metal modules, which together were about as big as two television sets, set side by side. The machine, a 12-bit computer, included a one-half megahertz processor. Lincs sold for about $43,000 ‚Äì a bargain at the time ‚Äì and were ultimately made commercially by Digital Equipment, the first minicomputer company. Fifty Lincs of the original design were built.\\" Four remaining LINCs exist, one each at the Computer History Museum, Washington University, the Heinz Nixdorf Computer Museum and at the DigiBarn Computer Museum. Both BCL and CSL played a major national role in pioneering the acceptance of laboratory computing by the biomedical research community. Their successful projects not only closely involved scientific collaborators but also introduced students from the engineering disciplines into the biomedical research laboratory. = Washington University = Beginning in 1955, Cox was an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and then Professor of Electrical Engineering. In 1975 he became the founding chairman of the School of Engineering and Applied Science‚Äôs first Department of Computer Science and guided the department‚Äôs development and growth for more than 15 years. Cox was instrumental in building a department that has an international reputation for biomedical computing applications and computer networking. With Jonathan S. Turner and Guru Parulkar, he co-founded the Applied Research Laboratory in 1988. = Entrepreneurial career = Cox, Jonathan S. Turner and Guru Parulkar founded Growth Networks in 1998. Growth Networks produced an advanced networking chip set which focused on high performance switching components for internet routers. He served as Founder and Vice-President of Strategic Planning until the company was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2000. In 2007, he launched a new company, Blendics, Inc., that provides system-on-chip design tools and services to companies that wish to develop complex, proprietary, low-power integrated circuits and aids in the development of asynchronous computing systems. In 2015, inspired by concepts created by Wesley A. Clark, Cox founded Q-Net Security, Inc., a cyber-security firm. Q-Net Security markets a purpose-built unit that creates an impenetrable barrier between defined endpoints within an existing network. QNS is intelligence-grade, quantum-resistant security. Personal life Cox married Barbara (Bobby) Jane Lueders in September 1951. They were married until her death in 2006. Cox has three children, eight grandchildren, and four great- grandchildren. He lives in Sunset Hills, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri.  Memberships, awards and distinctions  Cox has been awarded 12 patents for his work and has 150 widely cited publications.{[citation neededdate=November 2019}} Cox has also received honors from a variety of professional organizations. He was recognized by Washington University with a Distinguished Faculty Award in 1987 and with the Eliot Society Search Award in 1997. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the St. Louis Academy of Science in 2001 and received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Washington University that same year.

Logan (1931-2010) was a British Nurse theorist who was co-author of the Roper-Logan-Tierney model of nursing, and became an executive director of the International Council of Nurses, and Chief Nurse in Abu Dhabi.  Early life and studies  Winifred W. Logan was born on 9 May 1931 and trained as a nurse at the University of Edinburgh, and later took a Masters Degree there and at Columbia University, New York, did an M.A. in nursing in 1966. Earlier in her nursing career (around 1950), Logan had come across foreign patients experiencing some 'culture shock' in a Canadian tuberculosis and thoracic health care facility. This led to Logan recognising that nurses need to take cognisance of the patient's biological, psychological, sociocultural and environmental needs in caring for them properly. Logan started a teaching post at the University of Edinburgh School of Nursing from 1962.  Nursing Career  Logan was appointed as Nurse Education Officer at the Scottish Office during the 1960s to 1970s. It may be there or at the University, that she first met Nancy Roper, her collaborator on the Activities of Living model of nursing. Logan also became an executive director of the International Council of Nurses, a consultant for the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Malaysia, Europe, and Iraq. Between 1976 and 1980, Nancy Roper invited Logan and Alison J. Tierney (also an Edinburgh alumna and staff member) to collaborate on a model of nursing. After her writing on nursing theory, Logan became Chief Nursing Officer of Abu Dhabi, establishing nursing services there.  Roper- Logan-Tierney model of nursing  With fellow University of Edinburgh alumna and its School of Nursing employees, Nancy Roper and Alison J. Tierney, Logan was one of this British nurse trio who led the development of the first UK model of nursing published and improved upon, and internationally applied, since 1980. \\"The Roper-Logan-Tierney model is based upon activities of living, which evolved from the work of Virginia Henderson in 1966. The activities of daily living are the key to the model of care which seeks to define ‚Äúwhat living means:‚Äù * maintaining a safe environment * communication * breathing * eating and drinking * elimination * washing and dressing * temperature control * mobilization * working and playing * expressing sexuality * sleeping * death and dying The factors that influence activities of living are biological, psychological, sociocultural, environmental, and politicoeconomic. These factors make the model holistic, and if they are not included in assessment, it will be both incomplete and flawed.\\" The authors developed the model up unto a paperback edition (in 2000) which, according to publisher's synopsis was one of the 'author's own assessment of the Roper-Logan-Tierney (RLT) model's use in practice and its place in future nursing development, a unique set of insights... an 'authoritative and complete account of the most influential nursing model in the UK and one of the most influential in the world.' The impact of the method was also recognised as potential pioneering theory, 'since its inception to influence high quality nursing care provision.' The moswl also allowed relatives to be aware of the care being (and to be given) and its benefits; and was used for handing over care plans from one shift of nurses to another. Co-author Tierney thought that it helped bring in 'an appreciation of just how complex nursing is and has assisted the move from thinking about ill health to that of health. It has helped bring the nursing process to life.' Nursing researcher writers often refer the model into different clinical settings (in 2004) in a neonatal care unit or (in 2006) a case study on pain control.

He was the director of the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory from 1935 until his death in 1956. Biography Cecil Ernest Eddy was born in Albury, New South Wales, on 21 June 1900, the son of Alfred Eddy, a primary schoolteacher, and his wife Samuelina, n√©e Evans. He was educated in various schools in Victoria, and in 1918 joined the Victorian Education Department as a junior schoolteacher at Wangaratta High School. In 1920 he entered the University of Melbourne, where he earned his BSc and DipEd degrees in 1923. That year he was granted leave to remain at the University of Melbourne and study physics under Professor T. H. Laby. He wrote his MSc thesis on X-ray spectroscopy. In 1926, Eddy became a senior science master at Geelong College, but decided he preferred being a researcher. He accepted an offer from the University of Melbourne, paid back his bond to the Education Department, and continued his research into using X-rays for chemical analysis. He was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship to study at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory under Sir Ernest Rutherford. Before departing for the UK he married Letitia Isabella Reid at the registry office in Collins Street, Melbourne, on 19 August 1927. Not finding Cambridge to his liking, Eddy returned to the University of Melbourne after just one year, and he and Laby produced a series of papers on the use of X-rays to detect impurities in minerals. It was for this work that Eddy was awarded his DSc in 1930, and the David Syme Research Prize the following year. Eddy became a fellow of the British Institute of Physics in 1931, and served as president of its Australian branch from 1948 to 1949. In 1935, he was appointed the director of the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory, a position he held until his death. The British Society of Radiographers made Eddy an honorary member in 1945, and he became a founding fellow of the Australasian Institute of Radiography in 1950. He also became an honorary member of the College of Radiologists in 1950, and the Faculty of Radiologists, London, in 1952. He served on the council of the National Association of Testing Authorities from when it was established in 1946, and from 1947 was the chairman of the National Health and Medical Research Council's standing committee on X-rays. In 1956, Eddy was elected chairman of the United Nations' scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation. He was also appointed a member of the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee, which was set up to monitor the British nuclear tests at Maralinga. As such he viewed the Operation Mosaic tests in Western Australia in June 1956. On the way back to Melbourne he collapsed in Perth, and was taken to St John of God Subiaco Hospital, where he died on 27 June 1956. The cause of death was recorded as lobar pneumonia with myocarditis and septicaemia. His remains were cremated. He was survived by his wife and two sons.

He was born in England on 7 August 1788 and arrived in the Colony of New South Wales on 14 February 1792 in the Pitt, a convict ship. His father, William, had been sentenced to transportation for seven years, and had brought his wife and two sons with him. An older son, James, arrived as a free settler in 1808. Career as a miller James and Benjamin built and operated several water-driven flour mills in the following years. Exploration In October 1817, Benjamin Singleton set out with a party of men including William Parr and Aboriginal guides to find a route, suitable for wagons, to the Hunter River. They almost reached the Hunter Valley before turning back. In April 1818 he led a private expedition to the Hunter which was also unsuccessful. When, in 1819, John Howe managed to reach the Hunter, he followed in part the route discovered by Singleton and Parr. He had discovered some fine grazing land, but Howe was dissatisfied with the route. In February, 1820, John Howe left Windsor with a party of fifteen, including Benjamin Singleton and two Aboriginal guides. By following the advice of the guides they were able to find a route which became known as the Bulga Road. On 15 March they reached the Hunter, and followed its course upstream as far as Maitland. For his part in this expedition Singleton was granted , part of which became the site of the town of Singleton. Later occupations Singleton used his land for grazing cattle while pursuing other activities. He was appointed to be a district constable, and continued his mill building business. He also built a horse-drawn boat, which was not a commercial success. Death He died on 2 May 1853, leaving a wife and ten children, and was buried in the Whittingham cemetery, near Singleton. Singleton Council The Singleton Council publishes a brochure about Benjamin Singleton, and displays a copy on its website. It contains the story of his life and includes a photograph of the plaque on his grave. The plaque describes him as \\"Pioneer of the Hunter District and Founder of the Town of Singleton\\". It recounts that, in 1837, he donated land for a market square, which is now known as Burdekin Park.

He was an Englishman who served as prior of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre before his appointment as archbishop. A certain Odo had been consecrated archbishop of Tyre in 1122 while the city was under Seljuq control. He died before the city was captured during the Venetian Crusade of 1124, but no new archbishop was immediately appointed. In the spring of 1128, Patriarch Warmund of Jerusalem consecrated William as archbishop. Against Warmund's wishes, he travelled to Rome to receive his pallium directly from Pope Honorius II, which no other archbishop from the Latin East had ever done. In 1111, Pope Paschal II had ruled that only those parts of the ecclesiastical province of Tyre that lay within the Kingdom of Jerusalem were under the jurisdiction of the archbishop, thus removing from his jurisdiction the suffragan sees of Tripoli, Tortosa and Gibelet, which lay within the Principality of Antioch. These were placed under the jurisdiction of the patriarch of Antioch. William chose to go to Rome in 1128 to receive his pallium because of the opportunity to petition the new pope to restore his authority over Tripoli, Tortosa and Gibelet. Bishop Roger of Lydda accompanied him to Rome and the two were also carrying out a mission for King Baldwin II. In Rome, William was successful in both missions. Honorius ordered all the bishops of the province of Tyre to obey the archbishop and confirmed that the entire province lay within the patriarchate of Jerusalem. He and Roger were also successful in their secular mission, helping arrange the marriage of Melisende, heiress of Jerusalem, to Count Fulk V of Anjou. Honorius sent a legate, Cardinal Giles of Tusculum, to the east to enforce his new ruling, but Patriarch Bernard of Antioch ignored it. Since no suffragan dioceses were set up in the Kingdom of Jerusalem during Warmund's life and his actual suffragans remained loyal to Antioch, William started out as a metropolitan without suffragans. In 1129, William confirmed the former Greek Orthodox cathedral of Saint Mary in Tyre to the canons of the Holy Sepulchre, which had acquired it before he became archbishop. Probably he had his own cathedral in a new church dedicated to the Holy Cross. Whether the later cathedral of Tyre was begun during his reign is not known. In 1130, William's successor as prior of the Holy Sepulchre, William of Malines, was appointed patriarch of Jerusalem. He set about creating new suffragan dioceses for Tyre: at Beirut (1133), Sidon (1133) and Acre (1135).

A spoken phrase is repeated several times, without altering it in any way, and without providing any context. This repetition causes the phrase to transform perceptually from speech into song. Discovery and first experiment The illusion was discovered by Deutsch in 1995 when she was preparing the spoken commentary on her CD ‚ÄòMusical Illusions and Paradoxes'. She had the phrase ‚Äòsometimes behave so strangely' on a loop, and noticed that after it had been repeated several times it appeared to be sung rather than spoken. Later she included this illusion on her CD ‚ÄòPhantom Words and other Curiosities' and noted that once the phrase had perceptually morphed into song, it continued to be heard as song when played in the context of the full sentence in which it occurred. Deutsch, Henthorn, and Lapidis examined the illusion in detail. They showed that when this phrase was heard only once, listeners perceived it as speech, but after several repetitions, they perceived it as song. This perceptual transformation required that the intervening repetitions be exact; it did not occur when they were transposed slightly, or presented with the syllables in jumbled orderings. In addition, when listeners were asked to repeat back the phrase after hearing it once, they repeated it back as speech. Yet when they were asked to repeat back the phrase after hearing it ten times, they repeated it back as song. Neurological substrates of the illusion Theories of the neurological substrates of speech and song perception have been based on responses to speech and song stimuli, and these differ in their features. For example, the pitch content within spoken syllables generally changes dynamically, while the pitches of musical notes tend to be stable and the notes tend to be of longer duration. For this reason, theories of the brain substrates of speech and song perception have invoked explanations in terms of the acoustic features involved. Yet in the speech-to-song illusion a phrase is repeated exactly, with no change in its features; however, it can be heard either as speech or as song. For this reason, several studies have explored the brain regions that are involved in the illusion. Increased activation has been found in the frontal and temporal lobes of both hemispheres when the listener was perceiving a repeated spoken phrase as sung rather than spoken. The activated regions included several that other researchers had found to be activated while listening to song. Speech material conducive to the illusion Phrases that are marked by syllables with stable pitches and that favor a metrical interpretation tend to be conducive to the illusion. However, the illusion is not enhanced by regular repetitions of the entire phrase. Further, the illusion is stronger for phrases in languages that are more difficult to pronounce and when listeners are unable to understand the language of the utterance. Listeners who experience the illusion The speech-to-song illusion occurs in listeners both with and without musical training. It occurs in listeners who speak different languages, including the non-tone languages English, Irish, Catalan, German, Italian, Portuguese, French, Croatian, and Hindi, and the tone languages Thai and Mandarin; however, it is weaker in speakers of tone languages than non-tone languages. Related illusions Margulis and Simchi-Gross have reported related illusions in which different types of sound are transformed into music by repetition. Random sequences of tones were heard as more musical when they were looped, and clips consisting of a mix of environmental sounds sounded more musical following repetition. These effects were weaker than that of the original speech-to-song illusion, perhaps because speech and song are particularly intertwined perceptually, and also because the characteristics of the speech producing the original illusion are particularly conducive to a strong effect. Explanations of the illusion Repetition is a particularly important characteristic of music, and so provides an important cue that a phrase should be considered as music rather than speech. More specifically, in song, the pitches of vowels are distinctly heard, but in speech they appear watered down. It has been suggested that in speech the neural circuitry underlying pitch perception is somewhat inhibited, enabling the listener to focus attention on consonants and vowels, which are important to verbal meaning. Exact repetition of spoken words may cause this circuitry to become disinhibited, so that pitches are heard more saliently, and so as sung. Indeed, the brain structures that are activated when the illusion occurs correspond largely to those that are activated in response to song. In addition, several features of a spoken phrase that are likely to occur in song are conducive to the illusion. These include syllables with more stable pitches, and phrases with more regular distributions of accents. Other explanations invoke higher-level musical structure and memory. Listeners are better able to discriminate pitches in repeated rather than unrepeated phrases when the pitches violate the structure Western of tonal music. Long term memory for melodies may also be involved: If the prosodic features of a spoken phrase are similar to those of a well-known melody, the brain circuitries underlying musical pitch patterns and rhythms can be invoked, so that the phrase is heard as song. Relationship to musical composition Many composers, including Gesualdo, Monteverdi, and Mussorgsky, have argued that expressivity in music can be derived from inflections in speech, and they have included features of speech in their music (see for a discussion). Another relationship was invoked by Steve Reich, in his compositions such as Come Out and It's Gonna Rain. He presented spoken phrases in stereo and looped them, gradually offsetting the sounds from the two sources so as to create musical effects, and these were enhanced as the discrepancy widened. Further, in Reich‚Äôs composition Different Trains brief excerpts of speech were embedded in instrumental music so as to bring out their musical quality. Today, much popular music, particularly rap music, consists of chanting rhythmic speech with musical accompaniment.

The workshop, which was part of the Austrian art movement called Wiener Werkst√§tte, is known for its Modernist Design, has been run by Carl Aub√∂ck I, II, III, and IV for more than 120 years.  Carl Aub√∂ck I  Carl Aub√∂ck I or Karl Heinrich Aub√∂ck I was a goldsmith before he founded the family's workshop in 1906 at Bernardgasse as a bronze goods company. Aub√∂ck's workshop was particularly noted for the manufacture of the \\"Weiner Bronzen\\". These small, bronze figurines were popular collectibles in Austria until the early 20th century. Aub√∂ck died in 1925.  Carl Aub√∂ck II  Kirche M√∂llersdorf, the parish built by architect Carl Aub√∂ck II.When Carl Aub√∂ck II (born 1900), who is also known as Carl Aub√∂ck Sr., inherited the workshop from his father, he began to introduce design changes that led the company towards the direction of Modernist Design, which the workshop would be known for. He first joined his father's workshop in 1919 and later studied painting and design at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. He also attended art courses at the Bauhaus under Johannes Itten, a Swiss expressionist painter and designer. He became a leading figure of Austrian modernism. After World War II, Carl Aub√∂ck II further expanded the workshop, which was supported by the design demands of the American occupying force. Aub√∂ck adopted a strategy where a basic design had manifold varieties so that more than 500 new objects were produced in the workshop from 1946 to 1950. These designs were influenced by Bauhaus modernism. His works on smaller household and office objects during this period made Aub√∂ck a cult hero among his contemporaries. In 1954, Aub√∂ck was awarded four gold medals during the Milan Triennale for designing a range of stylized metalware. Aside from his metal ware designs, Aub√∂ck is also known for his watercolor paintings.  Carl Aub√∂ck III  In his early years, Carl Aub√∂ck III (1924-1993) began collaborating with his father at the Werkstatte workshop. He began working as a G√ºrtler, which was part of the family's tradition. Unlike his predecessors, however, he is also noted as an architect. He completed an architecture degree at the Vienna University of Technology. Aub√∂ck has designed private houses, apartments, public, and industrial buildings not just in Austria but around the world. He was also an academic and the former president of the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ICSID). Aub√∂ck also studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he met Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Ray Eames, and Charles Eames. These figures inspired Aub√∂ck to integrate American trends in the products designed at the workshop, making them more international and modern. Under his direction, the workshop achieved international status and started collaborating with other design houses such as Herm√®s and Pierre Cardin. Aub√∂ck is also the father of Maria Aub√∂ck (1951), a noted Austrian landscape architect and educator.

He is best known for his aggressive prosecution of the Hawaiian Mob during the mid 1980s, which took place after the murder of his son, which was allegedly connected to organized crime.  Early life and education  Marsland, the grandson of Norwegian immigrants to Hawaii, was born on April 11, 1923. His father, Charles F. Marsland Sr., was a deep-sea diver and his mother Sadie was a schoolteacher. Marsland attended the prestigious Punahou School and, upon graduation, attended Tufts College in Medford, Massachusetts. While enrolled, he joined the US Navy Reserve Officers Training Corps as a rifleman and was subsequently deployed to fight in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. As a Naval commander, Marsland fought in the Philippines and, after the war, remained in the Navy as a prison administration officer at Pearl Harbor. Following his discharge from the Navy, he returned to Tufts and graduated with his bachelor's degree in 1949, then enrolled at Northeastern University's school of law in Boston.  Career  = Assistant attorney general in Massachusetts (1953 - 1958) = His first job as a prosecutor was working as an assistant attorney general in 1953, serving in the office of then-Massachusetts Attorney General George Fingold. As an assistant attorney general, Marsland prosecuted cases involving gambling, organized crime, and murder. = Campaign for Plymouth County district attorney (1958) = In 1958, Marsland resigned from the attorney generals' office and entered private practice. He attempted to run for his first elected office as Plymouth County district attorney, challenging incumbent John Wheatley. However, he fell short in the Republican primary, losing with 8,463 votes to 13,569 votes. Wheatley went on to win re- election unopposed. = Deputy Corporation Counsel in Honolulu (1967 - 1979) = Marsland left Boston following his divorce and moved back to Honolulu in 1967. His first job in Hawaii was as a deputy corporation counsel, handling civil litigation for the city of Honolulu. His work involved compliance with civil rights law, pursuing civil actions on behalf of the city, and defending police officers accused of brutality. During this period of his career, he developed a good rapport with the Honolulu Police Department which he carried with him to his next job as county prosecutor. = Prosecuting Attorney in Honolulu (1980 - 1988) = After joining the prosecutors' office, he briefly led a unit focused on the prosecution of career criminals. After being fired from the office, Marsland ran for and won the inaugural 1980 election, becoming the first elected Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu. After being elected, he was credited with doubling the size of the prosecutors' office and aggressively targeting organized crime.  Personal life  Marsland married a television presenter named Jayne Watts in Boston in 1953. With her, he had two children - Charles F. Marsland Jr. (more commonly known as \\"Chuckers\\") (born in 1955) and Laurie Jane Marsland (born in 1957). In 1967, Marsland and his wife separated. Marsland gained sole custody of his son Chuckers and returned to Hawaii. Later, he formed a relationship with an interior designer named Polly Grigg, who remained his domestic partner until his death in 2007. = Death = Marsland died at his Portlock home on April 11, 2007. In his honor, his family trust donated $3 million to the Shriners Hospital for children in Honolulu. This amount was the largest donation to the Shriners in Honolulu from a single individual.

Jewish tradition states that Ezra is the author of Ezra-Nehemiah as well as the Book of Chronicles,Babylonian Talmud Baba Bathra 15a, apud Fensham 1982, p. 2 but modern scholars generally accept that a compiler from the 5th century BCE (the so-called \\"Chronicler\\") is the final author of these books.

Due to the rejection, the surrounding inhabitants mounted opposition to the building project. =Verses 1‚Äì2= : Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the descendants of the captivity built the temple unto the Lord God of Israel, they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefs of the fathers' households, and said to them, \\"Let us build with you, for, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.\\" MEV *\\"Adversaries\\" or \\"enemies\\".Notes [a] on Ezra 4:1 in NKJV *\\"Zerubbabel\\": is the leader of the group and of Davidic line (), so he is associated with the messianic hope in the book of Zechariah, although none of it is mentioned in this book.

The enemies of the exiles try to destroy that community by assimilation, pointing out important similarities among their peoples (verse 2), wanting the exiles to be entirely like them, but the enemies don't have allegiance to Yahweh and assimilation for the exiles would have meant destruction of the covenant with God. The reference to the Assyrian king recalls the story in that after the fall of Samaria in 721 BC, the genuine Israel inhabitants of the northern kingdom were deported elsewhere and the Assyrians planted people from other places (bringing their own gods; cf. ) to the region of Samaria, initiated by Sargon (722‚Äì705 BC), but from this verse apparently extended to the reign of Esarhaddon (681‚Äì669 BC). =Verse 3= A page containing Ezra 4:3‚Äì8:22 in the Codex Gigas (English: Giant Book), the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world from 13th century. :But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel said to them, \\"You may do nothing with us to build a house for our God; but we alone will build to the Lord God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.\\" NKJV *\\"Jeshua\\": or \\"Joshua\\".Notes [a] on Ezra 3:2 in NKJV His office is not named in this book, but he is identified as the \\"high priest\\" in Haggai 1:1, , ; ; . *\\"House\\" refers to \\"Temple\\".Notes [a] on Ezra 4:3 in NKJV The rejection of Zerubbabel was based on \\"spiritual insight\\". =Verses 4‚Äì5= : Then the people of the land demoralized the people of Judah and terrified them while building, and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.

Historical divergence (4:6‚Äì23) The story of Zerubbabel was interrupted by the list of some accounts of hostilities which happened in a long period of time to illustrate the continuous opposition by non-Jews of the area to the attempts of the Jews to establish a community under the law of God. =Verse 6= :And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

Evidently troubled by the thought of losing revenue (, ) and with the Assyrian and Babylonians annals available for him, possibly containing records of the \\"chronically rebellious city\\" of Jerusalem, Artaxerxes was convinced and ordered the work to be stopped ().

Actually built as the City of Milwaukee by the Detroit Dry Dock Company at Wyandotte, Michigan, as Hull 44 and launched 12 February 1881, it was initially operated by Goodrich Transportation Company, Chicago, Illinois, with vessel official number 125906.greatlakesvesselhistory.com/histories-by-name/c/city-of- milwaukee-1 It was then sold to the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee RailwayTanzilo, Bobby, Senior Editor, Wisconsin Historical Marine Society, OnMilwaukee, Tuesday 29 October 2019. (later part of the Great Western Railway), on 1 May 1883, operating between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Grand Haven, Michigan. Sold in 1897, it plied between Holland, Michigan and Chicago for the Graham & Morton Line (Graham and Morton Transportation Company), and was renamed Holland, also reported as City of Holland. She was 231 feet in length or 241 feet in length, with a gross tonnage of 1148 tons. She was sold in 1917 to the Crosby Line, of Milwaukee, and reportedly rebuilt. Crosby Transportation Company took over for the railroad's cross-lake transportation. The vessel was transferred to the Holland Steamship Company, Milwaukee, Crosby Transportation Company, manager, in 1918. Renamed Muskegon in 1919. Accident The City of Muskegon, being operated by the Crosby Line, under the command of Capt. Edward Miller, according to two sources, or Edwin Miller, according to another, departed Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Monday evening, 27 October 1919, with 72 passengers and crew aboard. The weather was clear. It was caught in a ‚Äúraging‚Äù northwester on Lake Michigan early in the morning. Rather than come about, Capt. Miller made for the port at Muskegon, but he said that the vessel struck the bar at the entrance to the harbor. ‚ÄúA wheel paddle jammed in the sand, checking headway, and the great combers threw the ship about and hurled her into the pier.‚Äù She struck the south pier of the Muskegon channel. ‚ÄúThere she hung, momentarily, pounding into wreckage, and then slipping off into the deep channel, going down in 50 feet of water and blocking the harbor entrances. ‚ÄúFifty of the 72 passengers and crew guided to safety by a single flashlight in the hands of a coast guard, are known to have been saved. It was feared several were caught between decks. Survivors, most of whom escaped only in their night clothing, were being cared for by the Red Cross.‚Äù Another source lists the number of passengers as only 37. The survivors told of the bravery of Capt. Miller, his officers and crew, ‚Äúwho remained at their posts to the last.‚Äù ‚ÄúCapt. Miller, sensing disaster as the vessel was driven toward the pier, ordered all to leap for their lives, and the time-hallowed sea rule, ‚ÄòWomen first,‚Äô was followed. Only four women, one of whom was employed on the boat, were known tonight to have been lost.‚Äù ‚ÄúCapt. Miller declared the undertow swung his ship after she struck the bar. ‚ÄòI told the cabin boys to waken the passengers and crew and ordered all over the rail.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòThose who moved quickly were saved. The ones who held back lost their lives.‚Äô‚Äù The vessel was smashed to pieces. Within four minutes of striking, no portion of it remained above the waterline. Coast Guardsman R. J. Kaknborsky was credited with saving many lives, directing the way to safety with a flashlight just before the vessel was pounded to pieces.

The armed forces of the United States captured many Italian soldiers during the North African campaign Operation Torch, which started in November 1942 and sent 51,000 of them to the United States. After the signing of the armistice by the Badoglio government in Italy on September 8, 1943, and with Pietro Badoglio and the Kingdom of Italy officially declaring war on Nazi Germany on October 13, 1943, the Americans began to see the POWs as potential allies. The capture of Rome by the Allies on June 9, 1944, motivated many POWs to change sides. About 90% joined Italian Service Units, which operated in the United States and overseas.History of Prisoner of War Utilization by the United States, by George Glover Lewis, John Mewha, 1955, page 187 to 189 U.S. Army Service Corps ISUs operated as part of the US Army Service Corps. The men who volunteered were given jobs, monetary compensation and some freedom of movement. The POWs were promised that they would not see combat or be sent abroad. The 45,000 Italian POWs who joined ISUs moved to places with a shortage of manpower. These areas included coastal, industrial and depot sites across the United States. Each ISU had 40 to 250 men, with an Italian officer as their commander. ISUs worked with both military and civilian personnel. The units supported agriculture, hospitals, Army Depots, seaports and Army Training centers. ISUs were given Italian uniforms with ISU insignia and badges. The remaining 10% of Italian POWs (about 3,000) who did not volunteer or who were deemed to be Pro-Fascist were held in isolated camps in Texas, Arizona, Wyoming and Hawaii. The largest Fascist POW Camp was called Camp No. 1 in Hereford, Texas. ISU members called it Campo Dux, which was the name of Mussolini's Fascist youth camps in Italy. Some called these camps camice nere, meaning Blackshirts, in reference to the Fascist paramilitary. Some who did not volunteer were concerned about family members living in German-occupied Northern Italy. Italian Americans in the United States began to look into the low-security Italian POW camps to find relatives, family friends or those from their hometowns. Some Roman Catholic churches hosted dinners on Sunday where local Italian-Americans visited with Italian POWs in the camps. Italian POWs could often leave the camp, escorted by a US soldier. In October 1945, the ISUs were decommissioned and their members returned to Italy. As an acknowledgment of their service, some ISU members became US immigrants. Most arrived home in Italy in January 1946. By the end of the war, the ISUs had contributed millions of hours to the Allied war effort. Some formed bonds and relationships with locals. POW-American couples traveled to Italy to be married before returning to America, due to quotas restricting immigration into the US after the war.

Biography The son of a harness maker, Irby was born in York County, South Carolina, on January 26, 1807. In 1833, he married Sardis Walraven, with whom he had two sons. He later moved to Georgia for unknown reasons. On December 18, 1838, Daniel Johnson sold Irby 202.5 acres of land (known as Land Lot No. 99) in what later became Buckhead for $650. Soon after this purchase, Irby established what became known as Irby's Tavern, a combination of a tavern and a grocery store. The previously sparsely-populated area around the tavern became known as Irbyville. Irby remained the owner of Buckhead until his death on February 20, 1879. Irby Avenue in Buckhead is named after him, as is the apartment complex \\"The Irby\\" located on that street, which was under construction but nearing completion as of February 2019. =Origin of the name Buckhead= Irby is credited with inadvertently giving Buckhead its name when he prominently displayed the head of a buck that had been shot near his tavern. Several details of this story are uncertain. For example, it is unclear who exactly shot the deer, though it may have been Irby himself, his neighbor John Whitley, or an anonymous Native American. It is also uncertain whether the buck's head was mounted on a yard post or over the door of the tavern. The year of this occurrence is also uncertain, but it was soon after Irby first purchased the area, around 1838 or early 1840.

The road stretches from Becks Road to Seven Bridges Road, and is split into West Skyline Parkway and East Skyline Parkway. It follows the ancient shoreline of Glacial Lake Duluth. The byway is known for its views of Duluth, Superior, Wisconsin, the Saint Louis River and Lake Superior.  History  = Pre-history = Skyline Parkway follows the shoreline of Glacial Lake Duluth. 18,000 years ago when the Laurentide Ice Sheet began to retreat it eventually created the shoreline and Glacial Lake Duluth. The lake was formed around 11,000 years ago. It would then drain and reveal the shoreline that Skyline Parkway follows. = Conception (1888‚Äì1892) = Skyline Parkway is considered \\"Duluth's First Tourist Attraction\\". It was conceived by William K. Rogers, the city's first park board president, in 1888. Rogers was a businessman and graduate of Harvard Law School who first arrived in Duluth in 1870. He came to Duluth to invest in the budding community. Construction began in April 1889 on Tenth Street, and by August the road was being used. The road slowly began to crawl west, but construction was difficult due to the terrain and rock. The road lacked an official name but was known locally by several names. Terrace Parkway, The Boulevard, the Boulevard Drive, Lake View Terrace, or Bay View Terrace were all used. By 1892, the Boulevard ran from Chester Bowl to Lincoln Park. = Rogers Boulevard = In 1894, the Duluth park board decided to officially name the boulevard. They voted unanimously to name it Rogers Boulevard in honor of William K. Rogers. Also in 1894, the city created two lakes that the road ran between. These are now known as Twin Ponds.  Expansion  445x445px In 1904, construction started to expand Rogers Boulevard past Lincoln Park. This part of the construction was expensive and difficult due to several ravines. By the end 1908, the road was extended to Oneota Cemetery. By 1913, it stretched to Thompson Hill. Rogers Boulevard was now in length. = Snively Boulevard = In 1899, future Duluth mayor Samuel F. Snively began work on his own scenic byway. Snively contacted many Duluthians like Chester Congdon and G.G Hartley to help finance the road. Snively Boulevard followed Amity Creek and passed Snively's farm. After difficulty maintaining the road and wooden bridges, Snively approached the park board for assistance. In 1910, the board gained control of the road, and it would eventually be added to the city parkway system. It was later renamed Seven Bridges Road. = Bardon's Peak Boulevard = In 1925, now-Mayor Snively finished \\"The Mayor's Boulevard Extension.\\" This is a section near Proctor, Minnesota, that extends from Thompson Hill to Becks Road. This extension runs along an outcrop known as Bardon's Peak, named after pioneer of the area James Bardon. This peak provides views of West Duluth, Morganpark, Smithville, Riverside, and Gary-New Duluth. 397x397px Bardon's Peak Boulevard was built over Stewart Creek, and the Stewart Creek Bridge was constructed spanning it. This bridge was registered in the National Register for Historic Places in 1989. Also along this section is the Magney-Snively Natural Area. It was named after Snively and another Duluth mayor, Clarence Magney. The section between Stewart Creek and Becks Road remains unpaved. The section between Magney-Snively Park and Becks Road is closed during the winter months. It remains open only for snowmobiles, bikes, and foot traffic. = Mission Creek Boulevard = In 1928, under Snively the boulevard extended to Jay Cooke State Park. This new section was known as Mission Creek Boulevard. It was largely ignored and today is closed to traffic, but remains a footpath. = Skyline Parkway (1929) = In 1929, after the completion of Mission Creek Boulevard, Snively declared the parkway finished. After a competition ran by the Duluth News Tribune, the parkway system was renamed Skyline Parkway. This system included Rogers Boulevard, Snively Boulevard, Bardon's Peak Boulevard, and Mission Creek Boulevard. = 2012 flooding = In 2012, a historic flood hit northeastern Minnesota. Portions of West Skyline Parkway were washed out trapping a neighborhood for a week. An area next to the Stewart Creek Bridge, and another area by Spirit Mountain trapped the neighborhood between them. Near the bridge, a monument for Samuel Snively was rebuilt following the flood.

The book has been translated into Japanese and French. Plot summary The Druids of Yamath, defeated in the previous volume, plot with the Sarks of Shembis and Tsargol to destroy their mutual enemy Thongor of Valkarth and restore their dominion. They resolve to have his beloved, Sumia of Patanga, abducted by assassin Zandar Zan, using her to lure Thongor into a trap. The scheme goes awry; Sumia falls into the sea from Zandar's airboat, and is rescued by exiled Rmoahal tribesman Shangoth, while Zandar himself, fleeing from the pursuing Thongor, crashes into a mountain. Fearing both dead, Thongor exits his own airboat to search for them, only to have Zandar, who has survived, steal it. The stranded Thongor happens on Shangoth's father, the Rmoahal chieftain, being tortured by the shaman who exiled them, and rescues him. Meanwhile, Sumia and Shangoth are taken captive by Adamancus, one of the Nine Magicians of Zaar who are the secret power behind the Yamath Druids. Thongor overtakes Zandar Zan, who falls to his doom from the airboat. In the recovered boat, Thongor arrives at Adamancus's lair in time to save Sumia and Shangoth from being sacrified to a devil the magician has summoned. With the Rmoahals' aid he goes on to defeat the combined forces of Shembis and Tsargol, which then become part of his empire.

She is the former president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). She was an advocate for women's equality through intersectionality with economics. Early life and education De Saram was born on February 27, 1939 in Queens, New York. She attended Grover Cleveland High School in Queens. In a high school music class, De Saram was given a French horn, despite no former formal music training; after intensive training, she auditioned for the All City Orchestra and made second horn, playing a French horn solo at Carnegie Hall. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics from Columbia University. Career =Wall Street= After earning her bachelor's degree, De Saram moved to Tribeca to work as a computer analyst at Chemical Bank, and was later appointed as the bank's Assistant Vice President =Women's movement= De Saram's first protest occurred in 1964, when she sent a full-page letter to Procter & Gamble stating disapproval of an advertisement for Tide and that she would try another brand. In response, she received a full-page letter reply and the company pulled the ad. While working on Wall Street, a coworker informed De Saram of a National Organization for Women (NOW) meeting in New York. The meeting, De Saram's first, took place in 1970 in the basement of a church as no other place would rent to the women. As a result, she participated in a march down Fifth Avenue in 1970 for women's rights. As she got more involved, De Saram focused on ending credit discrimination against women on the basis of their marital status. In 1971, De Saram and other members of NOW New York engaged in a zap action when they snuck into the American Stock Exchange, under the guise of a garden club. Once admitted, she and her protest partners held up a banner reading \\"Woman Power,\\" where each letter matched the size of the balcony windows. They yelled \\"We can't bear any more bull!\\" The Stock Exchange essentially shut down, as the brokers stopped their work to boo the protestors. De Saram and her protest partners had previously arranged for a van to drive around Wall Street calling out \\"Women have taken over Wall Street!\\" As the protesters left the Stock Exchanged, they marched to the Treasury steps. As a result, many gathered to see the protestors. She also caused the closure of a Citibank branch by encouraging women to close accounts with them. Upon seeing this, the bank president shut the doors and made all women line up in order to close accounts. De Saram and female protestors held banners outside the bank which was caught on film and used in a movie. As a result of NOW's pressure, Citibank changed their terminology around women and actively campaigned directly to women. In 1974, De Saram was elected president of the New York chapter of NOW and called a hearing for the New York State Human Rights Commission regarding the practice of firing pregnant women and denying them benefits. De Saram served two terms as president of the New York NOW chapter. Also in 1974, De Saram testified before the Congressional Banking Commission about discrimination in credit against women. At that time, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) required couples with two incomes to prove that the woman had been sterilized. One year later, in 1975, this requirement was banned by federal legislation. De Saram took on the State Human Rights Commission in 1974 over providing unemployment benefits to pregnant women; her activism ended the practice. She later served on the New York State Human Rights Commission Advisory Council. In that same year she participated with the National Council of Churches on stockholder actions against unfair hiring practices at corporations. In 1975, De Saram came up with the idea for a Women's Bank and was also a member of the Advisory Board of Directors and worked with a group of women to form a Feminist Credit Union. De Saram eventually left the bank in 1981 to serve in Mayor Ed Koch's administration as New York City's Commissioner of the Treasury. In 2009, De Saram resigned as chairperson of Community Board 1's Tribeca Committee but remained on the board. De Saram helped form the Tribeca Community Association (for which she also served as vice president) as well as the Committee for the Washington Market Historic District.  Personal life  De Saram and her husband. Raymond Erickson, a musician and scholar, have two children, Lisa and Douglas.

The first British edition was published in paperback by Tandem in July 1970, and reprinted in March 1973. The book has been translated into Japanese and French. Plot summary Seeking vengeance on his enemy, evil magician Mardanax of Zaar, infiltrates Patanga, capital city of Thongor's growing Lemurian empire. He succeeds in striking Thongor down and drugging his wife Queen Sumia into pliability. Under Mardanax's sway she agrees to wed the nobleman the Zaarian has marked out to be his puppet ruler. The young officer Charn Thovis, fearing for the safety of Thongor and Sumia's young son Thar, spirits the prince away, but a giant flying lizard forces their airboat down and the two fall into the hands of Barim Redbeard's pirates from the rogue city-state of Tarakus. Concealing their identities, the two at first are able to join the crew, but Thar is soon found out and taken hostage by the pirate king Kashtar. Meanwhile, Thongor's spirit-form passes through a gloomy netherworld, receiving messages regarding his destiny, culminating in a personal encounter with Father Gorm, chief of the Nineteen Gods, who tells him how he has been marked for greatness and must return to the world of the living to complete his work. He is granted visions of a future extending from his own impending conquest of the whole continent through several cataclysms in which the civilization of Lemuria is succeeded by that of Atlantis, and ultimately, \\"at the end of time,\\" early Egypt. The culmination of his historical vision is thus the beginning of our own recorded history. The author implies that Robert E. Howard's \\"Hyborian Age\\" and its premier hero Conan the Barbarian fits into this grand panorama. In Tarakus, Charn and Thar's shipmates help them escape and return to Patanga to prevent Sumia's forced wedding. Their airboat crashes the ceremony, and the machinations of Mardanax are exposed as Thongor leaps from his coffin and dispatches him. The book includes a frontispiece map by the author of \\"Patanga, City of the Flame\\" and a semifictional appendix on \\"The Source of the Lemurian Mythos\\" in which he claims to have derived the overall storyline of the Thongor books from a translation of the rare Indian scriptures known as the Upa-Puranas in combination with some of Helena Blavatsky's Theosophic notions of prehistorical races.

The first British edition was published in paperback by Tandem in August 1971, and reissued by Star in April 1979. The book has been translated into Japanese and French. Plot summary Kashtar, ruler of the pirate city-state of Tarakus, joins forces with a wizard who has dabbled in the forbidden secrets of lost Nianga, among them, a ray that causes madness--\\"the Gray Death,\\" as it is known to its victims. With it, Kashtar hopes to conquer all Lemuria, and incidentally escape having his realm absorbed into the growing empire of Patanga, ruled by the upstart barbarian conqueror Thongor. After Kashtar takes the best ship in Patanga's fleet and captures Thongor's old friend Karm Karvus, Thongor determines to free him and gain intelligence by sneaking into Tarakus. Posing as a crewman of Barim Redbeard, the pirate captain who helped his son escape Kashtar in the previous volume, he suits deed to word, only to be separated from his allies before he can reach his goal. He has to continue on to his goal on his own. As Thongor approaches the city, he meets Karm Karvus, who has escaped on his own along with an imprisoned princess, and learns the pirate invasion fleet has set out for Patanga. Fortunately, they are able to link up again with Barim's ship and infiltrate the fleet as originally intended. Taking the ship bearing the death ray, they turn it on the enemy's own vessels. Once Tarakus is defeated in battle, it is annexed to Thongor's empire. The book includes a frontispiece map by the author of part of Lemuria and concludes with an \\"Author's Note.\\" Setting The Thongor series is Carter's premier entry in the Sword & Sorcery genre, representing a tribute to both the Conan series of Robert E. Howard and the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. He pictures the lost continent of Lemuria as a prehistoric kingdom located in the Pacific Ocean during the Ice Age, where Mesozoic wildlife persisted after the cataclysm wiped them out elsewhere. An intelligent reptilian humanoid race descended from dinosaur reigned supreme as the dominant life form but was partially supplanted by humanity as the continent was colonized by fauna from outside Lemuria. Humans have gradually thrown off their subjection by the older civilization. Culturally, Lemuria is a mixture of civilization and barbarism but overall is precociously advanced over the outside world, boasting a magic- based technology that includes even flying machines. The Thongor books relate the struggle of the titular hero to unite the humans of Lemuria into a single empire and complete the overthrow of the \\"dragon kings\\". Reception Robert M. Price writes \\"[t]he Lemurian books pulse with a color and vitality that we miss in many of Lin Carter's later works. ... Yet to his relative inexperience we may also lay the blame for certain inconsistencies and failures to reckon with the implications of what he has written.\\" Among these he notes \\"Thongor eating dates from the East as if he were in Europe\\" and \\"hail[ing] from [Lemuria's] wintry North,\\" when, with the continent \\"south of the Equator, it would get hotter the further north you went!\\"Price, Robert M. \\"Thongor's Saga.\\" Chapter in Lin Carter: A Look Behind His Imaginary Worlds. Mercer Island, WA, Starmont House, Inc., 1991, pages 13-22. The novel was also reviewed by Charlie Brown in Locus no. 64, September 30, 1970, and Ted Pauls in Locus no. 74, February 14, 1971.

Biography He began his artistic training under the direction of Victor Meirelles then, in 1883, enrolled at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, where he studied with Jo√£o Zeferino da Costa, and Pedro Am√©rico. This was followed by studies in Paris with Gustave Boulanger and Jules Joseph Lefebvre at the Acad√©mie Julian. He completed his artistic education in Florence; taking private lessons from the sculptor, . He rarely participated in official exhibitions; preferring to hold private showings, of which there were four between 1888 and 1898. They were themed around love of the homeland and the final one was called the \\"Exposition of Republican Art\\": celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Republic. In 1893, together with D√©cio Villares and Virg√≠lio Lopes Rodrigues (1863-1944), he helped establish a movement devoted to creating a free academy of the fine arts and organized exhibitions to support the project financially. Their plans had to be abandoned, however, due to continuing social disruptions caused by the Revolta da Armada. After the mid 1890s, he gradually turned to sculpture. His first major work was a monument to Marshall Floriano Peixoto, now located in the Plaza of the Republic in downtown Rio de Janeiro. He also created monuments to Tiradentes, Benjamin Constant and St. Francis of Assisi. Inspiration for his work came from the positivist theories of Auguste Comte. He also worked as an architectural restorer; most notably of the roof shield at the entrance to the chapel of the . In the late 1910s, he participated in decorating the in Porto Alegre.

Life  Purchart enjoyed great devotion among his monks. Thus, several stories are told about him, for example the one that in his youth, he went with Ekkehart II to Hedwig, the Countess of Swabia, at Castle Hohentwiel. He is supposed to have amused her with his self-composed verses, whereupon she gave him lessons in Greek. However, from the time before his election as abbot, documentary validation of his career is lacking; not even the book of vows gives any indication. Henry II affirmed the immunity of the abbey and the free election of abbots on 17 June 1004. Purchart's term of office ended when he died of an epidemic that befell Henry II's army on the return from his campaign of Italy.  Works  Purchart is said to have countermanded the corruption of the Abbey of Saint Gall after Kerhart's reign. He restored the abbey breed and brought a lot of lost property, especially issued fief, back to the abbey. Moreover, he had the convent buildings repaired and enlarged, increased the church treasure and probably equipped the cloister with images from the life of Saint Gall and inscriptions written by Ekkehard IV. Under Purchart, the German language was especially cultivated, as Notker Labeo was at that time head of the convent school of Saint Gall. Purchart successfully resisted legal and financial claims of the Bishopric of Constance and the archpriests in particular.  External links  * Erhart, Peter. 2010: \\"Purchart\\".

At the Rock Coronation 2004-2005, it won in the category of ‚ÄúFestival of the Year.‚Äù  Overview  The festival director was Siarhiej Ani≈°ƒçanka. The basis of the festival was a competition of young bands from different countries, famous rock musicians were invited to the festival too. The last festival, which was held on October 26‚Äì27, 2007, was attended by 25 youth bands from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The main condition for the contestants was the presence of songs in the Belarusian language in the repertoire.  Ban  Rock-kola was banned in November 2007 as a result of a protocol of the Polotsk City Executive Committee, which stated to \\"consider inexpedient to hold events, which are alien to the historical and spiritual heritage of the city of Polotsk and Orthodoxy, such as the festival Rock-kola, in the city, recommend to the responsible persons which are answerable for the spiritual education of young people to refrain from initiating such events.\\" Nevertheless, the festival organizing committee considered other grounds for its holding, such as Minsk, Novopolotsk, Russia‚Äôs Smolensk. According to Tuzin.fm, the prohibition of the festival may have been associated with the appointment of a new chairman of the Polotsk local office of the KGB, who reportedly expressed dissatisfaction as to the holding of the event. Following the meeting of musicians in the Presidential Administration of Belarus in November 2007, Vitaƒ∫ Supranoviƒç, head of the BMAgroup label and author of the festival Be Free, came to the conclusion that the closure of Rock-kola by the authorities was a political action. Siarhiej Ani≈°ƒçanka, being interviewed by Dmitry Kustovsky from Belsat TV in 2015, echoed his takeaway. Andrey Alexandrov is his article over at Belarusian Partisan on the topic referred to the signs of a political nature too.  Reception  Tat‚Äôyana Zamirovskaya, a journalist for the Muzykalnaya Gazeta, called it \\"a decent and very nice get- together without mock glossiness, arrogant pathos, and incomprehensible show off\\" in a report on the results of the festival in Novopolotsk in 2001. Reviewing the XV edition of the festival in 2005, Muzykalnaya Gazeta‚Äôs Anastasiya Shtukina wrote, ‚ÄúToday there is not a single urban project in Belarus that could boast the same popularity among young people and such a long history.‚Äù Aliaksandra Pa≈≠lava, author of the Muzykalnaya Gazeta, described the phenomenon of the festival in the article ' as \\"an idea that helps Polotsk and Novopolotsk to be one of the most rock'n'roll cities in Belarus, because there are many bands who know what to work for, they will have their viewership.\\" Mikita Zmitra≈≠ from Narodnya Naviny Vitsebska wrote on the results of the last festival Rock-kola, \\"For two days, Polotsk lived by music.

During his lifetime he was regarded as \\"the most learned man on R√ºgen\\".Erich G√ºlzow: Heimatbriefe Ernst Moritz Arndts. .  Early life  Pistorius was born in Bergen auf R√ºgen. The son of a Bergen deacon, he lost his father at an early age. His stepfather Brandanus Heinrich Gebhardi (1704-1784) promoted his scientific education. He attended school in Bergen, the Stralsund Gymnasium and the Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig. Afterwards he studied at the universities of Greifswald and G√∂ttingen. He then spent two years as a private scholar in Hamburg and Altona. During this time he was engaged in the translation of works by David Hume. In Greifswald he obtained a magister degree in 1756. In 1757, he took over a position as Pastor substitutus in Schaprode. On 27 April 1759, he became pastor and provost in Poseritz, where he worked until the end of his life. With the pastors Lorenz Stenzler and Joh. Eberhard Christian Kr√ºger, he formed a learned circle, which had good contacts to Ernst Moritz Arndt. The University of Greifswald granted him the title of Doctor of Theology in 1790. In 1798, he died in Bergen from pneumonia at age 68.  Career  In addition to his extensive theological knowledge, Pistorius possessed excellent knowledge of languages. He was particularly interested in philosophical studies and addressed, among other matters, topics of interest to the German and English philosophers of his time. He took a moderate Skeptical position. He was neither a supporter of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian Wolff, nor of Immanuel Kant. Following a visit to his brother-in-law Johann Joachim Spalding in Berlin in 1764 he became a member of the review journal '. In 33 years he wrote more than a thousand reviews, mainly of philosophical, but also of theological publications. Almost all of Kant's works belonged to this group.Bernward Gesang: Kants vergessener Rezensent. p. XI f. Known beyond the borders of Swedish Pomerania, Pistorius was mentioned in various descriptions of journeys to R√ºgen. His guests rarely judged him harshly, like Wilhelm von Humboldt, and mostly were enthusiastic like the Kosegarten pupil Karl Nernst or the Berlin Consistorial Councillor Johann Friedrich Z√∂llner.

These revolts were encouraged by the western allies, particularly Britain, who promised the Kurds an independent state. Nonetheless, the allies provided only limited military support. British promises of an independent Kurdistan were included in the 1920 Treaty of S√®vres, which assigned a small amount of territory for a planned Kurdish state, but these plans were abandoned in 1923 with the Turkish victory in the Turkish War of Independence and the ensuing Treaty of Lausanne.  Background   Timeline  = Initial revolt (1914) = The first Kurdish rebellion during World War I took place prior to the Ottoman entry into World War I. In August 1914, the nephew of the mayor of Dersim was killed by a member of the Ferhatu≈üaƒüƒ± tribe, and in response to Ottoman reprisals the Ferhatu≈üaƒüƒ± tribe rebelled. The Ferhatu≈üaƒüƒ± were joined by the Karaballƒ±, Lower Abbas, Abbasu≈üaƒüƒ± and Ko√ßu≈üaƒüƒ± tribes. The murder of the chieftain of the Ferhatu≈üaƒüƒ± tribe ended the rebellion. = Uprising in Botan (1915‚Äì1916) = In spring 1915, a Kurdish revolt broke out in Botan. The revolt drove out the Ottoman troops entirely and as a result, the locals would govern the region for over a year. = Uprising in Dersim, Ottoman deportations (1916) = The Dersim uprising of 1916 was an Alevi Kurdish uprising led by Ali Aƒüa in the region of Dersim. Its causes laid in the Kurdish fear that they would suffer the same fate as the Armenians, as well as the desire to remove the state control in Dersim. In a bid to gain Kurdish support, Russian emissaries promised to local chieftains that Dersim would be given independence after Russian occupation. The uprising began in early March 1916. Kurdish rebels occupied and destroyed the towns of Nazimiye, Mazght, Pertek, and Charsandjak, and then marched towards the residence of the province governor (vali), Mamuret√ºlaziz (modern day Elazƒ±ƒü). As the Kurds advanced, they captured many weapons from Turkish soldiers. Turkish officials in Mezere and Harput felt extremely threatened by the Kurdish revolt, since the Russians at the time occupied the area between Erzurum and Erzincan which adjoined Dersim to the north. The Ottoman army would likely to be incapable of resisting a coordinated Kurdish-Russian advance on Harput, leading the Muslim population of that settlement to make preparations to escape. In response to the Kurdish rebellion, Ottoman authorities launched an operation to clear Dersim from Kurdish rebels on 1 April. Involved in this operation was the Ottoman 13th division, led by Galatalƒ± ≈ûevket Bey. This division included a contingent of troops led by Hasan Khayri Bey, as well as Shafi‚Äôi Kurds. On the day following the start of the operation, Kurdish rebels launched an unsuccessful counterattack on Pertek. Kurdish rebels were defeated at (13 April) and ≈ûimaligarb√Æ (16 April). By 16 April, the rebels had been reduced to an area between Nazimiye and the Ohi stream. On 18 April, after defeating 500 rebels in the area, Ottoman troops looted and the surrounding villages. The next day, they burned down the village of Lemit. As Ottoman troops advanced, they clashed with Kurds at ≈ûeyhin, Kopik (22 April), G√∂kerik Hill, Sinevarta≈üƒ± (23 April), and Zelbaba Hill (28 April). On 2 May, the Kurdish rebels surrendered. The operation had concluded with the defeat of the rebels, who had suffered heavy casualties. With the situation now having come under Ottoman control, the preparations of the Muslim civilians of Harput to escape had been rendered obsolete. After the defeat of the uprising, entire populations of the responsible tribes were deported from Dersim. = Uprisings in Botan, Dersim, and Kharput (Summer 1917) = In summer 1917, Kurdish rebellions took place in Botan, Dersim, and Kharput. = Last rebellions (August 1917) = In early August 1917, Kurdish rebellions took place in Mardin and Diyarbekir, followed by Bitlis. While the other Kurdish uprisings received no military support by the Allies of World War I, the uprisings of August 1917 received limited Russian support.

The train accident was the deadliest in Pakistan since 2005, when the Ghotki rail crash killed more than 100 people. Preliminary evidence suggested the explosion of a portable stove occurred because some passengers illegally cooked food aboard the train. Such use of gas stoves is common on Pakistan's railways; train authorities often turn a blind eye to the dangerous practice. Accident The accident occurred at 6:18 a.m. PST (01:18 UTC) on Main Line 1 in Liaquatpur tehsil, Rahim Yar Khan district, Punjab aboard the Tezgam express passenger train. Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad, the Pakistani Federal Minister for Railways, reported that two gas stoves exploded, setting the train on fire. Other reports, though, along with survivors' testimonies, suggested an electrical problem was the cause of the fire. The train was carrying 933 people, 207 of whom were in the three carriages that were gutted. Ten fire engines were dispatched to the scene of the fire and Pakistani Army troops assisted in the rescue operation. The most severely injured were taken to Bahawal Victoria Hospital in Bahawalpur and Nishtar Hospital in Multan. Those with less severe wounds were treated at DHQ hospital in Liaquatpur and Shaikh Zayed Hospital in Rahim Yar Khan. According to witnesses, the train's fire took 20 minutes to put out. Another train was dispatched to rescue stranded passengers and take them to Rawalpindi.  Victims  Some of the 75 victims died jumping from the moving train, which reportedly did not stop until about 20 minutes after the fire broke out, despite the communication cord being pulled. Fifty-seven of the dead were burned beyond recognition; DNA tests were needed for identification. At least 43 passengers were injured, 11 critically. Reaction The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, ordered an immediate inquiry into the accident. Sheikh Rasheed, the railways minister, announced a ‚Ç®1.5 million compensation fund for each of the families of the dead, as well as ‚Ç®0.5 million for those injured.

The European Union should take action collectively only when Member States‚Äô power is insufficient. The principle of subsidiarity applied to the European Union can be summarised as \\"Europe where necessary, national where possible\\". The principle of subsidiarity is premised from the fundamental EU principle of conferral, ensuring that the European Union is a union of member states and competences are voluntarily conferred to Member States. The conferral principle also guarantees the principle of proportionality, establishing that the European Union should undertake only the minimum necessary actions. The principle of subsidiarity is one of the core principles of the European law, and is especially important to the European intergovernmentalist school of thought.  EU recognition of the principle of subsidiarity  The term ‚Äúprinciple of subsidiarity‚Äù\\"Principle of subsidiarity\\". Europa. was not referred to in the first European texts. It is mentioned for the first time in 1992 in the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) as amended by the Maastricht Treaty. The Article 3b states:‚ÄúIn areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action be better achieved by the Community‚Äù Treaty establishing the European Community, Official Journal of the European Communities, No C224/6, 31.08.1992 The Treaty on the European Union (TEU), also written in 1992, states: ‚Äúdecisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.‚ÄùTreaty on European Union, Official Journal of the European Communities, No C191/1, 29.07.1992 In 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam proposes a Protocol on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality establishing the conditions of application of both principles. It is established that the Union wishes that ‚Äúdecisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens of the Union‚Äù and that ‚Äúthe overall approach to the application of the subsidiarity principle (‚Ä¶) will continue to guide the actions of the Union‚Äôs institutions as well as the development of the application of the principle of subsidiarity‚Äù Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts, Official Journal of the European Communities, C 340/1, 10.11.1997. The Treaty of Lisbon places in 2007 the principle of subsidiarity as one of the fundamental principles of the European Union. The article 3b states: ‚ÄúThe limits of Union competences are governed by the principle of conferral. The use of Union competences is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality‚Äù. Treaty of Lisbon amending the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Official Journal of the European Union, C306, Vol 50, ISSN 1725-2423, 17.12.2007 Since the Lisbon Treaty came into force at the end of 2009, national Parliaments have a role in policing the principle of subsidiarity. Under the so-called Early Warning System, they can submit reasoned opinions if they feel a new Commission proposal violates the subsidiarity principle (van Gruisen and Huysmans, 2020).https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1465116520923752 van Gruisen P. & Huysmans M., The Early Warning System and policymaking in the European Union, European Union Politics, doi: 10.1177/1465116520923752  The principle of subsidiarity in EU governance  The unprecedented development of subsidiarity in the European Union in the 1990s was caused by the increased of EU policies in the post-Maastricht period. In the 1990s, the European Union was preparing for the future enlargement of Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) as well as for the establishment of the Eurozone, and therefore needed to reinforce its task-allocation model. This model, called EU competences, is subject to the two fundamental principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Content is copied from this source, which is ¬© European Union, 1995-2018. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged. = EU competences = There are 3 competences in the European Union governance: * _exclusive competence_ : the European Union alone is able to legislate and adopt binding acts. Therefore, the principle of subsidiarity does not apply to this set. * _shared competence_ : the European Union and the Member States are able to legislate and adopt binding acts. When the union does not exercise its own competence, or refuse to, the Member States exercise their own competence. * _supporting competence_ : the European Union can legislate and adopt binding acts only to support, coordinate or complement the actions of Member States. Legally binding acts must require the harmonisation of the Member States. The principle of subsidiarity guarantees that in the area of non-exclusive competences, the Union may act only if an action cannot be sufficiently achieved at the Member States level, and could be better achieved at the Union level. = Federalist v. Intergovernmentalist school of thoughts = Since its inception, the European Community, then becoming the European Union, has faced the remarks and critics of two main school of thoughts: the federalists, defending a centralised decision-making model, and the intergovernmentalists, in favour of a broader share of competences. On one side, the federalist school is in favour of more supranational decisions. For them, most of the decisions should be taken at a central level, by the Union, in order to improve the efficiency of decision-making, enjoy scale economies and avoid negative spillovers issued from local decisions. The fiscal federalism theory therefore perceives the principle of subsidiarity as a guarantee that the decisions will be taken at central level when there would demonstrable benefits of conducting the policy by the Union. On the other side, the school of intergovernmentalism defends a decentralized model and more decisions taken by Member States, with a process in which the local knowledge enables to take the most adapted decisions and the citizens can express their disagreement by direct contact with the politicians or leaving the region (Voice or Exit principle). For the intergovernmentalist theory, the principle of subsidiarity guarantees that decisions will be taken as closely as possible to citizens, and therefore at the lowest level possible. The EU principle of subsidiarity is seen by the literature as sufficiently unbounded to satisfy both school of thoughts and approach to centralization (Golub, 1996; Teasdale, 1993; van Kersbergen and Verbeek, 1994).  The principle of subsidiarity in EU environment policy  = EU environmental policy = The Paris Summit in 1972 announced the development of an Environmental Action Programme. This European initiative demonstrated the European Economic Community's endorsement in environmental policymaking by defining medium and long-term goals and actions. Historically the task- allocation model of the EU environmental policy has been widely criticised, pointing out the lack of European coordination being an obstacle to the decision-making. Therefore, the European Union increased progressively its power over the years, mainly by a series of amendments to the Treaty of Rome and the increase of its EU bodies's influence over individual Member States. The EU environmental policy is a shared competence between the Union and Member States: the Member States are able to exercise their competence only if the Union has not already exercised its competence. = EU ordinary legislative procedure = Based on the ordinary legislative procedure, the EU Council (formed of the leader of the 28 Member States) can propose suggestions of environmental legislation to the European Commission, who has the exclusive right to propose new environmental policies to the European Parliament (directly-elected body) and the Council of the EU (made of Member States' environment Ministers). After they received the proposal, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU follow the co-decision procedure and review the proposal; they can either reject, amend or approve the proposal. If approved, the European Commission has the responsibility to ensure the implementation of the environmental legislation by Member States. = European Environment Agency = The European Environment Agency (EEA) was created in 1994 and is a European agency providing information on the environment. Its headquarter is located in Copenhagen (Denmark). Its management board is made of representatives of 33 states (the 28 European Union member states together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey), a representative of the European Commission and scientists appointed by the European Parliament. The EEA helps the EU institutional bodies in the development, implementation and evaluation of the EU environmental policy, but does not have any competence in the legislation and adoption of binding acts in this field.

It was located on the west bank of the Nushagak River. The site is approximately 6 miles southwest of the city of New Stuyahok and 3 miles northeast of the city of Ekwok. It was initially noted by the Nushagak Russian Orthodox Church vital statistics in 1863 and was visited by a missionary. In 1879, it was noted to have 47 residents. A Father Vasili Shishkin visited the settlement in 1882 and noted it was \\"one of only three\\" occupied villages along the river. The 1880 census did not mention the number of homes occupied, though the 1890 census stated there were two (surveyed by A.B. Schanz).http://libsysdigi.library.illinois.edu/oca/Books2008-07/historicsettleme61vans/historicsettleme61vans.pdf Historic Settlement Patterns in the Nushagak River Region, Alaska p.42-44 Agivavik would not be mentioned again until noted anthropologist Ale≈° Hrdliƒçka in his survey of Alaska, visited the site in 1931 and was told by his guide that the village had been abandoned around 1900. Reports and maps had erroneously placed the location of the village on the wrong side of the river or in the wrong location entirely.
