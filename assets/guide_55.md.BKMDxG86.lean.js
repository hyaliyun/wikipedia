Life Winefred Wigmore was born at Lucton, one of twelve children born to Sir William Wigmore and Anne Throckmorton. Three of her brothers, including William Wigmore, became Jesuits. She met Mary Ward in 1605, and lived with her in London on Ward's return to England in 1609. She remained \\"Mary Ward's close friend and loyal companion until Mary's death\\", helping found the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1622‚Äì23 Wigmore became headmistress of schools established in Rome and then Naples, and in 1624 she was appointed superior in Naples. In 1630 Ward sent Wigmore to deal with the foundation at Li√®ge, who were unhappy with Ward. Wigmore's loyalty to Ward led to her deposing the Li√®ge superior, Mary Copley, and the rift gave ammunition to the Institute's detractors in the papal court. Though the pope suppressed the Institute in 1631, and Wigmore was briefly imprisoned, the 'English ladies' kept up discreet communal life in Munich and Rome. Wigmore stayed in Rome with Ward, acting as her novice mistress, secretary, and nurse. She accompanied Ward to England in 1637, living with her in London and Heworth until Ward's death in 1645. After Ward's death, Wigmore and Mary Poyntz continued the Institute. The execution of Charles I made it dangerous to continue living in England, and in 1650 Institute members relocated to Paris under the leadership of Barbara Babthorpe. Wigmore was headmistress of a school of English girls there. She died in April 1657, and was buried in the cemetery of the Benedictine nuns. Ward and Poyntz composed Ward's first biography, the Briefe relation. Manuscript copies exist in both French and English.

Her research considers the design of materials for catalysis, fuel cells and sustainable chemistry.  Early life and education  Escudero-Escribano was born in C√°ceres, Spain. Her father is a technical engineer who specialises in chemistry. She attended the Camilo Hern√°ndez de Coria public school until the age of thirteen, before moving to the Norba Caesarina Institute. She studied chemical engineering at the University of Extremadura. She moved to Madrid for her doctoral studies, earning a PhD at the Autonomous University of Madrid in 2011. She worked alongside √Ångel Cuesta on the electrochemical reactions that take place inside fuel cells. During her doctorate she worked at the Residencia de Estudiantes as an intern, and completed visiting scientist positions at the Argonne National Laboratory and University of Ulm. The Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry selected the doctoral thesis of Escudero- Escribano as the best PhD in the region of Madrid. After earning her doctorate she joined the Technical University of Denmark as a postdoctoral researcher. Here she started working on novel electrocatalysts for fuel cells.  Research and career  In 2017 Escudero-Escribano was appointed as a Professor at the University of Copenhagen, where she leads the Nano-Electrochemical group. Her research considers new materials for electrochemical reactions, and investigates them using in situ optical spectroscopy and microscopy. She is interested in using these materials for sustainable energy applications; including the generation of hydrogen through water splitting. In particular, Escudero-Escribano works on new catalysts for energy conversion devices. This involves searching for alternatives for the platinum catalysts that are typically used in fuel cells. She has developed platinum alloys that contain lanthanide elements which are more efficient. She has considered the coupling of water electrolysers with other renewable sources, such as solar panels and windmills. Typically this coupling is complicated due to the intermittent power generation and low efficiency of renewable energy sources, but can be facilitated by developing the water electrolysers, where energy can be stored in the chemical bonds between hydrogen molecules. The efficiency of these electrolysers depends on the electrodes; in particular, the anode where the water oxidation takes place act as the bottlenecks of these devices. In 2019 it was announced that the Danish National Research Foundation would support Escudero-Escribano in establishing the Center for High Entropy Alloys Catalysis at the University of Copenhagen. The Centre looks to contribute toward decarbonisation, making a more sustainable chemical industry. Worldwide the chemical industry is responsible for almost 10 % of greenhouse gas emissions. = Awards and honours = * 2014 Sapere Aude - Research Talent Grant * 2016 European Chemical Society (EuChemS) Young Chemist Award * 2016 Young Researcher CIDETEC Award * 2018 American Electrochemical Society Energy Technology Division Young Investigator Award * 2018 Hyundai Young Series Talent Out of Series Award * 2018 Princess of Girona Foundation Scientific Research Award * 2019 Clara Immerwahr Award * 2019 Spanish Royal Society of Chemistry Young Researcher Award * 2019 Nature Research Award for Inspiring Science Finalist  References  Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish women chemists Category:Spanish women scientists Category:People from C√°ceres, Spain Category:University of Copenhagen faculty ","title":"Mar√≠a Escudero-Escribano"},{"id":"62234846","text":"Will Lawton (born 24 June 1974) is an English singer-songwriter, pianist, hang player, and music therapist.

As a two-year-old in 2019 he won his first race and then ran second in both the Solario Stakes and the Royal Lodge Stakes before winning the Vertem Futurity Trophy. On his first appearance as a three-year-old he won the 2000 Guineas in record time. Background Kameko is a bay or brown colt with a narrow white blaze and four white socks bred in Kentucky by Calumet Farm. As a yearling in September 2018 he was offered for sale at Keeneland and was bought for $90,000 by Sheikha Melissa Al Fahad on behalf of Sheikh Fahad Al Thani's Qatar Racing. He was sent into training with Andrew Balding at Kingsclere in Hampshire. The horse name of Kameko is taken form Japanese, meaning \\"child turtle\\" . He was sired by Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey's stallion Kitten's Joy the U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse of 2004 whose other offspring include Roaring Lion, Stephanie's Kitten, Hawkbill, Bobby's Kitten and Big Blue Kitten. Kameko's dam Sweeter Still (a half-sister to Kingsbarns) was bred in Ireland but spent most of her racing career in North America where she won five races including the Grade 3 Senorita Stakes in 2008. She was a great- great-granddaughter of Mesopotamia, an Irish broodmare whose other female-line descendants have included Halling, Mastery, Balla Cove and Just The Judge. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Kameko was ridden in all of his starts as a two-year-old by Oisin Murphy. The colt made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park on 25 July when he started at odds of 15/2 in an eight-runner field. After racing in fourth place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off a late challenge from the outsider It's Good To Laugh to win by half a length. Five weeks later, over the same course and distance, the colt was stepped up in class and started a 14/1 outsider for the Group 3 Solario Stakes. He tracked the leaders before finishing strongly but failed by a nose to overhaul the odds-on favourite Positive. At Newmarket Racecourse on 28 September Kameko started 6/5 favourite for the Group 2 Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile. Murphy positioned the colt just behind the leaders before going to the front in the last quarter mile but he was caught near the finish and beaten a neck by the Aidan O'Brien- trained outsider Royal Dornoch. The Group 1 Vertem Futurity Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 26 October attracted an unusual five-day entry of twelve, with Kameko matched against eleven colts from the O'Brien stable. As a result of heavy rain at the already waterlogged Yorkshire track the race was abandoned and rescheduled to take place six days later on the synthetic Tapeta surface at Newcastle Racecourse, with entries being reopened. In the new race Kameko started the 11/2 third favourite behind the unbeaten Kinross and Mogul, the winner of the Champions Juvenile Stakes and the best fancied of the five O'Brien runners. The other eight contenders included Verboten (representing Godolphin), Innisfree (Beresford Stakes) and Tammani (Prix Isonomy). The race was the first British Group 1 contest to be run on a synthetic track. Kameko settled just behind the leaders as Royal County Down set the pace, before moving up to take the lead approaching the final furlong. He quickly went clear and despite hanging to the right in the closing stages he won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a quarter lengths from Innisfree. After the race Andrew Balding said \\"He was impressive, but he's a very good horse who is improving all the time... How far will he stay? A mile and a quarter will be no problem, but we'll have to wait and see whether he stays a mile and a half. If he does, there is only one place he will go. We will probably start him off in the Guineas and go from there. We can still dream.\\" In the official rating of European two-year-olds for 2019 Kameko was rated the second-best juvenile of the year, level with Earthlight but ten pounds inferior to Pinatubo. =2020: three-year-old season= The flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the 2000 Guineas was run a month later than usual on 6 June over the Rowley mile at Newmarket. As racing had been cancelled in April and May Kameko went into the race without a previous run but Balding expressed confidence in his trainee saying \\"He's a big framed horse. He's not the flashiest horse in his routine exercise but he's always been the type that, every time you ask him for a little bit more, he's given and improved for it. Oisin was always saying of Roaring Lion, who was by Kitten's Joy, he seemed to just thrive on racing and every time he ran he just got better and better. I think this horse is very similar.\\" In the Guineas Kameko went off the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Pinatubo, Arizona (Coventry Stakes) and Wichita (Somerville Tattersall Stakes). The other eleven runners included Military March (Autumn Stakes), Kinross and Royal Dornoch. Murphy settled his mount in mid division as Persuasion set the early pace from Juan Elcano, Starcat and Wichita. Entering the last quarter mile Wichita went to the front with Pinatubo on his left and Military March to his right as Kameko looked to be trapped behind horses and unlikely to obtain a clear run. In the final furlong Kameko forced his way between Wichaita and Military March to gain the advantage and despite hanging right towards the centre of the track he won by a neck. Wichita took second place ahead of Pinatubo and Military March. The winning time of 1:34.72 was a new record for the race. Commenting on his first win in a Classic race Murphy said \\"It means the absolute world to me. It's the stuff of dreams. Around four furlongs he got a little bit lost but he came home really well. It was a gutsy performance. He hardly blew a candle out afterwards ‚Äì he must have a tremendous amount of ability\\". When asked about the colt's prospects for the Epsom Derby Andrew Balding said \\"To me it looks the obvious choice, there would be a stamina doubt but there's only one way to find out. Probably his optimum trip would be a mile-and-a-quarter, but I think for one day only, he might be able to stay a mile-and-a-half.\\" On 4 July Kameko started the 5/2 for the 241st running of the Epsom Derby, over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. After tracking the early leaders he moved into fourth place behind the runaway leader Serpentine but was unable to make further progress and came home fourth behind Serpentine, Khalifa Sat and Amhran Na Bhfiann.

Early years Alexandre de Vincent de Mazade was born in Saint-P√©ray, Ard√®che, France, in 1735. His parent were Louis de Vincent de Mazade (died 1779) and Fran√ßoise Victoire de Geys de Montguillard. On 31 December 1779 he married Marie Th√©r√®se Sophie Chappotin (born 1757) in Port- au-Prince, Saint-Domingue. His wife was a Creole, so he belonged to the class of proprietors of the colony. He owned shares in a sugar company in Terrier- Rouge and several coffee plantations in the Western Province. Vincent de Mazade became a mar√©chal de camp. He was made a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In the 1780s he was a brigadier in the king's armies, second-in-command in Port-au-Prince, commander of the western part of the island and commander of the French Leeward Islands (√éles Sous-le-Vent). He had a good military reputation. Governor of Saint-Domingue Vincent succeeded C√©sar Henri, comte de La Luzerne in November 1787, as acting governor. He was Governor of Santo Domingo from November 1787 to July 1789. Fran√ßois Barb√©-Marbois was the intendant, or head of civil administration, during this period. One of the problems Vincent and Marbois had to handle was the extreme cruelty that the planter Lejeune inflicted on his slaves, in violation of the laws of Saint- Domingue. A conviction could be viewed as an indictment of the institution of slavery, and would humiliate the planters in the eyes of their slaves. There would be a danger that the slaves would refuse to obey orders, and the whole system would break down. This was not an isolated incident. They ordered deportation of the planter Maguero for barbarities against his slaves, and wrote that there were other cases that were even more serious, but did not have the \\"clarity\\" afforded by the planter's confession. Marie-Charles du Chilleau, the Marquis du Chilleau, was appointed Governor General in March 1788. He did not arrive in the colony until the end of the year, and remained only until the beginning of July 1789. Vincent was replaced by Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier in August 1789. Later activity Vincent de Mazade was commander of the northern part of the colony in 1789. He tolerated the sedition of Jean-Jacques Bacon de la Chevalerie, but dissolved the insurrectionist Assembly of Saint-Marc, or L√©opardins, in 1790. Vincent de Mazade died in Saint-Thomas, Haute-Garonne in 1808.

It is loosely based on the 5th-century poem De reditu suo by Rutilius Claudius Namatianus. It tells the story of a nobleman who travels from Rome by boat to his native Gaul five years after the sack of Rome.  Plot  Five years after the sack of Rome by the Visigoths under Alaric, Rutilius Claudius Namatianus travels from Rome toward his native Tolosa in Gaul, with the intention to inspect what damages the invaders might have caused. Rutilius is a pagan nobleman with the high-ranking title of praefectus urbi. Because the land route is ruined and unsafe, he has to travel by boat. He also has a secret mission: to try to convince the Emperor, who is installed in Ravenna, to restore the dominion of Rome.  Themes  = Criticism of Christianity = The basis for the film is a 5th-century poem by the Roman writer Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, discovered in incomplete form and titled De reditu suo in the 15th century. The original poem contains strong criticism of the Christian monastic movement, but not as a main theme. In the film, however, criticism of Christianity is a major focus. Both visually and thematically, The Voyage Home ties in with Roberto Rossellini's 1972 film Augustine of Hippo, for which Claudio Bond√¨ had been an assistant director. Rossellini portrayed a corrupt Christianity but also praised the Christian faith of Augustine of Hippo. Bond√¨'s film goes further and offers no positive view of the religion. Christianity and the Christian church are presented as fanatical and in opposition to the Roman values of peace and cultivation. Christian monks are portrayed as primitive, and in one scene evoke the Cyclops of the Odyssey, throwing rocks at Rutilius and his company. This sets The Voyage Home apart from many 20th-century films set in late antiquity. Not only is there a positive identification with the Romans, but the positive aspect of Rome is equated with its pre-Christian elements, rather than the Christianity of Constantine or Theodosius. The role of \\"barbarians\\", present in 20th- century films like Douglas Sirk's Sign of the Pagan (1954), is not occupied by Goths or Huns, but by Christian fundamentalists. Similar perspectives on late antiquity appear in other early 21st-century films, such as Alejandro Amen√°bar's Agora from 2009. = Language = Several different languages appear in the film. In addition to the characters who speak Italian, there is an Albanian-speaking Isis priestess, a Polish-speaking helmsman, and an Eritrean maid. The intention was to show how the Roman Empire had lost the unifying element of a shared language. = The sack of Rome and 9/11 = Bond√¨ thought the setting shortly after the sack of Rome made the story relevant in the early 21st century, saying that the protagonist's \\"difficulty is very similar to ours with the Islamic world\\". Both Bond√¨ in interviews and Italian journalists who wrote about the film when it was released likened the sack of Rome to the September 11 attacks. Bond√¨ described it as \\"a traumatic and unbelievable event, something like the tragedy of the Twin Towers, that is, a direct attack at the core of the world's greatest power\\". The same analogy was made when a new English translation of the poem was published in 2016.  Cast  * Elia Schilton: Claudio Rutilio Namaziano * Rodolfo Corsato: Minervio * Romuald Andrzej Klos: Socrate * Marco Beretta: Rufio * Caterina De Regibus: Sabina * Roberto Accornero: Vittorino * Xhilda Lapardhaja: priestess * Roberto Herlitzka: Protadio  Production  Claudio Bond√¨ became familiar with De reditu suo when he studied Latin literature at the Sapienza University of Rome as a 20-year-old in 1964. He was attracted to the poem for its understanding of ancient culture. He also thought it had an \\"extraordinary modernity\\". Bond√¨ characterised Rutilius as a Stoic and Epicurean and wanted to make a film where the poet's political and philosophical themes are apparent. The film was produced by Misami Film. It received support from the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. It was made on a budget of three million euros. Bond√¨ aimed to be historically accurate when depicting phenomena like slavery, and at the same time make the film relevant for contemporary viewers. The actor Elia Schilton won the leading role because Bond√¨ thought his face looked ancient, because he spoke French, and because he had a peculiar accent.  Reception  The film was released in Italian cinemas by Orango Film Distribuzione on 16 January 2004. It received little attention and performed poorly at the box office. Emiliano Morreale wrote in FilmTV that it seems to be modeled on Roberto Rossellini's television works, and therefore \\"appears like a UFO in the Italian cinema of today\\". He found problems with the \\"economic poverty of the staging\\", parts of the casting, and the lack of intensity, but wrote that \\"a few well-chosen sets\\" partially save the film. It was shown at the 2005 Philadelphia Film Festival. Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that it has \\"an odd static quality about it\\" where \\"only the talk seems to linger on ‚Äì and on\\". He saw influences from Pier Paolo Pasolini and Rossellini, but also how the limited budget on occasions makes it feel \\"like a Monty Python parody\\". Todd Brown of Twitch wrote that \\"those looking for a violent toga epic a la Gladiator are looking in the wrong place ‚Äì this film is far more concerned with politics and frame of mind ‚Äì but history buffs will find a lot to love\\".

The case became a finale in a series of First Amendment battles which impacted across American media and culture. Weisfeld went on to create a popular line of irreverent pin-on humor-buttons that became an infatuation with college students and an enduring emblem of 1960s American pop-culture.  Prosecution  In the early sixties, Irwin Weisfeld owned The Bookcase, a small retail book store on Lexington Avenue in midtown Manhattan. On September 4, 1963, a 16-year-old girl entered the store and purchased a copy of Fanny Hill, a 1748 erotic novel by John Cleland which had been at the object of censorship disputes over pornography since first publication. A reprint of the book had been newly published by the venerable and respected company G. P. Putnam's Sons. Weisfeld had promoted the fresh release in his store's window with a sign: \\"is now, in the new era of Publishing and Reader Freedom, at last available .... We feel that with the publication of this book almost all of the barriers are now down, and it is happening in our time.\\" The mother of the girl who had bought Fanny Hill from Weisfeld's store filed a criminal complaint. Weisfeld, and the clerk who had sold the book, John Downs, were both charged and convicted of violating Section 484-h of the New York State penal code. This incident took place soon after major court rulings which found that such controversial books as William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch and Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer were not obscene and could be sold to the public; so the arrest of Weisfeld and Downs occurred at a flashpoint in First Amendment law, coming after other major rulings on controversial literary works and during the era when comedian Lenny Bruce was repeatedly prosecuted for obscenity. Weisfeld's case (New York v. Bookcase, Inc.) became a media event with ongoing coverage prominently featured in The New York Times, Time, and other mainstream news outlets.  Prosecution prompted by powerful interests  It was soon reported that the purchase of the Fanny Hill from Weisfeld's store and subsequent complaint by the girl and her mother were orchestrated by Operation Yorkville, a New York‚Äìbased interfaith pro- censorship group that was determined to stop distribution of the book, and had considerable influence and alliances with New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. (who was seeking to sanitize New York City's image before the 1964‚Äì1965 World's Fair), Cardinal Francis Spellman, and Norman Vincent Peale. After being released from jail, Weisfeld fought the charges in court while receiving crucial assistance from Barney Rosset, then owner of Grove Press (which had led a successful legal battle to publish D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, and was American publisher of Miller's Tropic of Cancer) and lawyers from G. P. Putnam's Sons.  Court rulings  New York v. Bookcase, Inc. worked its way through three levels of the New York State judiciary. Meanwhile, at the prompting of Operation Yorkville, district attorneys from New York's five boroughs jointly argued that Fanny Hill was obscene under state law and could not be sold to anyone, minor or adult. For a time, the case against both Weisfeld and the book, Fanny Hill, meandered through the courts. In 1964, to the outrage of Operation Yorkville and its allies & New York prosecutors, the guilty verdicts for Weisfeld and Downs were overturned; the New York appeals court concluded that NY obscenity laws were too vague, and the New York case against the book was thrown out. In 1966, The U.S. Supreme Court (after agreeing to hear a separate Massachusetts case) concluded that Fanny Hill was not obscene. These were the cumulation of a long line of court rulings that experts on constitutional law view as setting new standard for what is permissible (under First Amendment protection) and so led to changes in the nature of American media. Portrayal in media In 1969, The Seven Minutes, a best selling novel by Irving Wallace, featured a storyline (a small bookstore owner is prosecuted and persecuted by powerful and corrupt interests, after selling a provocative book) which seemed a salacious and much fictionalized version of Weisfeld's case. In 1971, 20th Century Fox released a movie version of The Seven Minutes, directed by Russ Meyer. Ironically, the movie features conservative actor Tom Selleck portraying a liberal lawyer who makes strident arguments for expansive view of First Amendment Protection. Creation of hippie-era \\"kooky buttons\\" Even as the court cases against Bookcase, Inc and Fanny Hill came to a close, Irwin Weisfeld found his small bookstore under pressure from large chain bookstores that had opened in midtown-Manhattan. During 1966, Weisfeld closed his bookstore and began to write and manufacture a line of joke pin-on buttons (or badges) that displaying mostly irreverent statements of Weisfeld's creation. The project began as a bet between Weisfeld and close friend Martha Foley (Weisfeld had studied under Foley at Columbia University and she had included Weisfeld's short story \\"SAUL\\"‚Äîwritten as I. W. Vanetti‚Äîon her 1961 Roll of Honor in The Best American Short Stories 1962). For years Foley had encouraged Weisfeld to develop a project that could capitalize on his wit and biting use of language and some of Weisfeld's initial buttons were created from Foley's memories of Weisfeld's sly off the cuff remarks. A Selection of Irwin Weisfeld's 1960s Buttons After a good response from the New York literary scene, Weisfeld began to mass produce some of his joke buttons and sell them through ads in magazines. Weisfeld's buttons caught on with \\"smart-aleck\\" college students and hipsters across the America. Unlike \\"hippie\\" or \\"psychedelic\\" images that were featured on most 60s pin-on buttons, Weisfeld's buttons featured a design and fonts which showcased Weisfeld's irreverent and ironic copy writing. Among a large number of popular mid-1960s buttons Weisfeld created: \\"AMERICA: MURDER-MADNESS-SEX... and THE BEST DAMN ICE CREAM in the world\\", \\"DEATH IS NATURE'S WAY OF TELLING US TO SLOW DOWN\\",\\"KILL FOR PEACE\\", \\"SEX: THE BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS\\", \\"if it moves, fondle it\\", \\"SHAKESPEARE ATE BACON\\", \\"HERMAN MELVILLE EATS BLUBBER\\",\\"SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH or I'LL KILL YOU\\",\\"HAPPINESS IS A NICE WARM PUSSY\\", \\"ANARCHISTS UNITE\\", \\"PLEASE BE KIND: I'M ONLY A LITTLE GIRL IN A STRANGE TOWN\\", \\"ESKIMO POWER\\", \\"SAVE WATER: SHOWER WITH A FRIEND\\", \\"IF IT'S LIQUID, I DRINK IT\\", \\"GREAT SOCIETY: NEW LEECH ON LIFE\\", \\"PILLS, PLEASE\\", \\"STAMP OUT FIRST MARRIAGES\\", \\"FRODO LIVES\\", \\"WOMAN SHOULD BE OBSCENE AND NOT HEARD\\", \\"I'M MANIC DEPRESSIVE: BE WARNED\\", \\"GOD IS ALIVE: HE JUST DOESN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED\\", \\"YOU, I DON'T LIKE\\", \\"YOU STINK!\\", \\"MARY POPPINS IS A JUNKIE\\", and \\"WHERE IS LEE HARVEY OSWALD NOW THAT WE REALLY NEED HIM?\\". In the late 1960s Weisfeld's buttons were sometimes worn on air by TV comedy personalities. In later years Weisfeld's buttons sometimes appeared as visual reference to the 1960s, as in Jeremy Kagan's 1975 film Katherine', in which a selection of Irwin Weisfeld's buttons are shown (along with The Vietnam War, Fidel Castro and student demonstrations) in a montage of \\"1967\\".  Death  As the 1960s button fad peaked, Weisfeld designed what he hoped would become a new fad: a line of dart boards featuring the faces of various political figures. The dart boards were in early stages of marketing and distribution when Irwin Weisfeld died in 1968, at age 36, of lingering heart damage as a result of contracting Rheumatic fever as a child. Zodiac Killer demands buttons In a greeting card postmarked April 28, 1970, San Francisco's notorious Zodiac Killer made a threat to murder children unless the killer saw: \\".. some nice Zodiac buttons wandering about town... Everyone else has these buttons like, (peace sign), black power, melvin eats bluber (sic)...Please no nasty ones like melvin's..\\". The button text of this Zodiac card is read aloud by actor Anthony Edwards in David Fincher's 2007 film Zodiac over a montage at 61 mins. In January 2012, an article in Heavy Metal magazine detailed the exact connection between the Zodiac's button request and Weisfeld's buttons: the first two buttons referenced by Zodiac in the card, \\"(peace sign)\\" & \\"Black Power\\", were ubiquitous popular slogan buttons made and sold by Weisfeld's company, while \\"Melvin Eats Bluber\\" is Zodiac's particular distortion of Irwin Weisfeld's original button creation, \\"Melville Eats Blubber\\". (an otherwise irreverent comment regarding the author of Moby Dick). In switching \\"Melville\\" to \\"Melvin\\", the Zodiac Killer twisted Weisfeld's copy to mock portly San Francisco native Melvin Belli, a legal and media personality with whom The Zodiac had communicated and seemingly become annoyed. While a popular film like 1971's Dirty Harry presents a distorted version of The Zodiac Killer (renamed Scorpio in Dirty Harry) as a money hungry extortionist, buttons were (aside demanding his communications be printed in the papers) the real Zodiac Killer's only demand. Subsequent Zodiac letters included increasingly frustrated demands for \\"Zodiac Buttons\\". Some letters threatened Paul Avery, a flamboyant crime reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle with whom the Killer had apparently become disenchanted. While no buttons were made to satisfy the Zodiac Killer's particular demands for his own \\"Zodiac Button\\", staff at the San Francisco Chronicle (including Avery) begin wearing a button that read: \\"I AM NOT PAUL AVERY\\".

Baral is a native of Pokhara, Nepal. Baral was a college teacher and painter when he began drawing cartoons in the 1960s when he was asked to by the publisher of Naya Sandesh. He later said \\"I took the job of a cartoonist not our of interest, but much like a profession, and simply as a job. I had no idea or knowledge about cartoons. The editor explained to me what and how I was supposed to make cartoons. I made whatever he told me to do and I did it for four years.\\" Initially he drew comics secretly; he adopted the name Batsyayana, the name of a Hindu sage, because teachers were not allowed to publicly comment on politics. He later said \\"I could have lost my job, been imprisoned and tortured.\\" Due to media censorship, many of his cartoons were not published. He drew regular cartoons for the weekly Naya Sandesh from 1964 to 1967. He drew the comic strip Chyangbaa for the literary magazine Prangan from 1977 to 1978. In the 1980s, he drew the strip Aveyentar in Suruchi. In the 1990s, he drew the strip Pale Punya Bahadur for the UNICEF magazine Nawadrishya. Baral never drew King Birendra or Gyanendra, but frequently commented on the monarchy indirectly. He also frequently criticized the violence of the Maoist insurgents in Nepal. He drew many politicians, including prime ministers Prachanda, Baburam Bhattarai, Madhav Kumar Nepal, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and especially Girija Koirala, depicted with a prominent nose. One of his most notorious cartoons was published in 2005 and featured Koirala, then an opposition leader, carrying a dead horse labeled \\"constitutional monarchy\\" away from a garbage bin. (One commentator later noted this invoked the story of a grief-stricken Shiva carrying the corpse of his consort Sati.) The implication that King Gyanendra had \\"consigned the constitutional monarchy to the garbage bin\\" prompted outrage. Narayan Wagle, editor of Kantipur, and Prateek Pradhan, editor of The Kathmandu Post, were arrested. The next day, Kantipur published a statement that concluded \\"This newspaper affirms its commitment to the constitutional monarchy and democracy.\\" Critics even called for the execution of Baral. Baral's son Ajit Baral compiled and published a collection of his father's cartoons called Batsyayana and His Barbs: A Cartoonist's Take on Post-1990 Nepal (2006).

It uses a sequence-based hi-lo pattern to generate values. It can be used with domain-driven design (DDD). Hi/Lo is used in scenarios where an application needs its entities to have an identity prior to persistence. It is a value generation strategy. An alternative to Hi/Lo would be to generate keys as universally unique identifiers (UUID).  Explanation  The preconditions are: * There is a constant defined to hold the maximum low value. The value must be greater than zero. A suitable value could be 1000 or 32767. * There is a variable defined to hold the currently assigned high value and it is assigned the value 0 (zero). * There is a variable defined to hold the currently assigned low value and it is assigned the value of the maximum low value plus 1 (one). The steps are: # If the currently assigned low value is greater or equal than the maximum low value then call a function to fetch a new high value and reset the currently assigned low value to 0 (zero). # Assign a key by multiplying the currently assigned high value with the maximum low value and adding the currently assigned low value. # Increment the currently assigned low value by 1 (one). A sequence diagram of the Hi/Lo algorithm.  Algorithm  The (integer) and (integer) variables are internal state variables. The internal state is retained across invocations. The (integer) constant is a configuration option. \`get_next_hi\` is a function that retrieves a new high value from a database server. In a relational database management system this could be through a stored procedure.

After the massive demographic changes of the 1990s in central Pretoria, the Bronberg, Arcadia (which had earlier absorbed Meintjieskop, Burgers Park, and Harmonie congregations were all absorbed by the Pretoria Reformed Church (NGK).  Foundation  Until the evening of October 15, 1942, the congregation's area made up the western portions of the then enormous Pretoria East Reformed Church (NGK), which had four pastors and around 90 council members. The congregation started off with large parts of Sunnyside, Muckleneuk, and Arcadia. The congregation took its name from the original name of Muckleneuk Ridge, the Bronberge. Beeld described the etymology as follows: > The Bronberg NGK congregation in Sunnyside celebrating its 50th birthday > next year was named by a charter deacon who served as a recorder of deeds at > the time. Mr. Carl Basson (78) of Lynnwood, Pretoria had access as such to > the office of the Surveyor-General. He visited that office looking for > inspiration when it came time to name the congregation, finding an 1875 map > showing the ridge from Die Wilgers to near UNISA in Muckleneuk, first > labeled the Bronberge. Fountains Valley was then known as De Bronen (\\"the > source\\"). Several names were considered at the following congregation > meeting, including Sunnyside, Ebenaser, and Immanu√´l, but Mr. Basson > reported that the majority was in favor of the last suggestion, his own. Services were at first held in the renovated Sunnyside Hall, formerly used by the main Pretoria congregation and then by Pretoria East until the latter's current church (the \\"Ooskerk\\") was built. The Rev. Hendrik Dani√´l Alphonso du Toit (later pastor of the Paarl Reformed Church (NGK)) was confirmed on the first ballot on the evening of Monday, November 2, 1942, and he served the congregation until June 1948. The Rev. Herman Kinghorn (later working in the Robertson Reformed Church among others) was co-pastor from May 1947 to June 1950, joined by Dr. Louis Viljoen Rex from August 1948, who would work alone afterwards until 1953.  Later developments  The Arcadia congregation officially seceded at the June 19, 1951 council meeting, several months after the Ring (Sub-Synod) Committee approved of it. The Bronberg congregation was dominated by transient students and youth. However, they secured a church site for themselves quite early. The building, designed by architect Hendrik Vermooten, was inaugurated on January 22, 1955 and now belongs to the Pretoria congregation. In 1952, Ons gemeentelik feesalbum wrote: > Bronberg was known for the high level of volunteering among the around a > thousand young people in its congregation, especially in the civil service, > who lived in temporary housing or apartments for significant periods of > time.

It records the original endowment to the temple by Mushika Validhara Vikrama Rama in 929 CE. He donates land for nanda vilakku (the permanent lamp) and nivedyam (the food offering) to the deity Narasinga Vinnakar Thevar. The so-called Agreement of Muzhikkulam is quoted in the record. Merchant guild manigramam was appointed as the guardian of the temple. * The second inscription, dated to 1075 CE, is engraved on obverse sides of three granite blocks in the base of central shrine of Narayankannur Temple. This is the second dated inscription of Alupa king Kunda Alupa who probably extended his influence to northern parts of the Kannur district in the 11th century CE.

First developed in the 1890s, the district was originally planned to be an upper-class suburban neighborhood of Chicago with spacious homes. Development in the early twentieth century made the neighborhood denser, and while it was still a wealthy neighborhood by 1930, it featured many apartment buildings as well. The district's houses reflect Chicago's architectural development at the turn of the century; while its nineteenth-century homes have Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival designs, its twentieth-century houses exhibit newly popular styles such as the Prairie School and Classical Revival. The district's apartment buildings were designed in part to match the character of its houses, as doing so portrayed a sense of luxury and domesticity to its affluent residents; as a result, they largely used the same styles as the twentieth-century homes and often included courtyards to replace lawns. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1984.

Jablon first came across Thailand's old stand-alone theaters while studying at Chiang Mai University, and was inspired to photograph and document the disappearing buildings. He started publishing photos through his blog in 2009, and has since continued with the project. His work has been exhibited and published in book form. Biography Jablon is from Philadelphia. He says his interest in Asian culture began around age 12‚Äì13, when he saw the Hong Kong film Police Story 3: Super Cop. He graduated in Asian studies from Temple University, and began graduate studies in sustainable development at Thailand's Chiang Mai University in 2006. His project documenting stand-alone movie theaters in Thailand began in 2009, after coming across an old theater in Chiang Mai, only to find that it had already been demolished when he returned to visit a few months later. He started the blog as a side project during a time when he was having difficulty with his master's thesis. Eventually, he adopted the subject as his thesis topic, and continued working on the project after graduating. Jablon has photographed and documented old stand-alone theaters throughout Thailand, as well as in Myanmar, Laos and, to a lesser extent, Cambodia and Vietnam. He would travel from town to town, photographing the buildings and interviewing staff and locals. He has received sponsorship from the Jim Thompson Foundation and the Thai Film Archive, though more recently he has been paying out of his own pocket. Jablon's documentation effort came as the buildings were fast disappearing‚Äîhe reckons about thirty stand-alone theaters were still operating in Thailand when he began the project, a number that had fallen to four by 2016. Of the almost 250 buildings he had photographed by 2019, probably half had disappeared. Jablon's work has been shown at various international exhibits, and he has written as an advocate for architectural conservation. His first book, Thailand's Movie Theatres: Relics, Ruins and the Romance of Escape, was published in 2019.

Fry founded the Dunnville Chronicle in 1896, a weekly newspaper serving Dunnville, Ontario. He managed local hockey and baseball teams in the 1910s, then became president of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) from 1922 to 1924. At the national level he was president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) from 1928 to 1930, was a Canadian Olympic Committee member and British Empire Games committee member from 1927 to 1938, and served as president of the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU of C) from 1934 to 1936. He sought better working relationships with the National Hockey League and the American Amateur Athletic Union, to compensate Canadian teams for developing senior ice hockey players. He aimed to implement standardized ice hockey rules for all leagues under CAHA jurisdiction. He recommended control of the Allan Cup be transferred from its trustees to the CAHA, who then reinvested profits into minor ice hockey in Canada. This coincided with growing interest in the playoffs for the Allan Cup and Memorial Cup. He presided over the AAU of C when it was losing direct control of amateur sport in Canada, and had recently split ways with the Canadian Track and Field Association. The CAHA, the Canadian Lacrosse Association and the Canadian Amateur Basketball Association were each challenging the definition of what was an amateur athlete. He was against profiting from sports, believed in maintaining the ideals of amateur sport and wanted the younger generation \\"to play the game for the game's sake\\". When it became apparent the CAHA was close to breaking away from the AAU of C in 1936, he said the decision was \\"the most important matter ever to come before an amateur body in Canada\\". In defending the old definition of amateur, journalist Ralph Allen compared Fry to a captain sinking with his ship; whereas journalist and former Olympian Bobbie Rosenfeld remembered Fry as a man who fought for true amateurism in sport, in the face of growing professionalism. He retired from sports in 1938, and his career was recognized with life membership in the CAHA and the OHA, and an appointment to Ontario Athletic Commission. Early life and newspaper business alt=The Dunnville Chronicle building exterior pictured in 2019 Fry was born on September 7, 1872, in Dunnville, Ontario, the son of Dr. and Mrs. J. S. Fry. He attended Dunnville Secondary School until age 16, then began working full-time in the newspaper business.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 430 He was hired in 1888 as apprentice by Robert White, publisher of the Dunnville Gazette. Fry worked for two years at the Gazette then moved to Ingersoll, Ontario, at age 18. He apprenticed four years with the Ingersoll Chronicle, then later worked six- month tenures in Tillsonburg, and Buffalo, New York.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 311Sorge, Lorne (March 1984), Vol. 7 During the five years as a newspaper apprentice, he learned the trade including editorials, advertising, typesetting and running printing presses. Fry returned to Dunnville in 1896 at age 24, and founded his own paper named the Dunnville Chronicle. He purchased the printing business owned by A. M. Moote, and added a hand-operated Washington press with financial assistance from his brother. The first issue was published on September 4, 1896, and competed directly with the Gazette and Monck Reformer in a town of approximately 2,000 people. He priced subscriptions for the Chronicle at $1 per 15 months, which undercut his Gazette competition at $1 per 12 months. He adopted a motto for the Chronicle; \\"For the Cause that Lacks Assistance ‚Äì 'Gainst the Wrongs that Need Resistance ‚Äì For the Future in the Distance ‚Äì And the Good that We Can Do\\". Writer Harold Melick stated the motto was likely derived from a poem by Scottish Anglican divine Thomas Guthrie.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 312 Fry also grew his business by handling printing contracts for local municipalities. He regularly upgraded printing equipment to stay ahead of his competitors, and maintain printing contracts. He installed a hand-powered Taylor drum cylinder in 1900, then added a natural gas engine in 1902 to run the press. He installed a linotype machine in 1907 which enabled his paper to run its own stories in a quicker timeframe, rather than republishing material from out of town papers. He upgraded the linotype in 1921, and expanded the format from six to eight columns per page when he installed a Babcock Optimus press in 1928. Fry moved his business to a larger building in 1903, and again in 1926. He outlasted the Monck Reformer which ceased operation in 1925, then bought the assets of the Gazette in 1940 after its owner died. Fry was a member of the Canadian Weekly Newspapers Association, and participated in its annual conventions. He wrote a weekly editorial in the Chronicle known as \\"Old Bill's Column\\", including his own wit and observations. In an interview given with the Toronto Star in 1935, Fry explained his desire to stay with a weekly paper by stating, \\"I'm smarter than the daily paper guys. The weekly doesn't get you down\\". =Community involvement= Fry was involved in local sports including baseball and ice hockey teams. He was the baseball manager of the 1907 Dunnville club, which won 17 games, lost six and tied one game during the season. The team played home games at Jubilee Park in Dunnville, and regular opponents included teams from Brantford, Buffalo, Hamilton and Welland.Sorge, Lorne (April 1988), Vol. 11MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 314 Fry stated in a 1935 interview, that his first love for a sport was ice hockey. He served as the business manager and secretary for the Dunnville Mudcats hockey club, which competed in the intermediate division of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) during the 1910s. The team's name derived from Fry's interest in mudcat fishing in the nearby Grand River.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 422 Fry was a member of the local Lions Club and the Masonic lodge.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 315 He provided space upstairs from his printing shop for the Dunnville Masonic Temple. His service to local organizations included being a director and treasurer of the Dunnville Agricultural Society Fair in 1908,MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), pp. 84‚Äì85 the local chamber of commerce, the board of governors for the Haldimand War Memorial Hospital, and the Dunnville public utility commissioner. Despite his involvement in service groups, he declined more than once to be a candidate for mayor of Dunnville when asked.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 379 Fry had community musical interests, and played cornet in the Dunnville band. He managed the local opera house, directed and produced performances of H.M.S. Pinafore at several theatres, sang as a tenor, and served as choir director of St. Paul's Anglican Church in Dunnville during World War I. After the war, Fry and fellow members of the Canadian Weekly Newspapers Association travelled to France and Belgium and visited graves of fallen Canadian soldiers. He located the graves of two soldiers from Dunnville on request of the parents of Arthur Smith and Fla Vanderburgh. He negotiated with authorities in Europe to let him take the wooden cross grave markers back home to Canada. He reportedly never let the crosses out of his sight until delivering them personally to the parents.MacDonald, Cheryl, ed. (1992), p. 119 One of the two crosses is displayed on the wall above the front door of St. Paul's Anglican Church in Dunnville, and was featured in a Remembrance Day ceremony in 2014. Ontario Hockey Association alt=Toronto Granites hockey team at the 1924 Winter Olympics Fry served as a convenor with the OHA in the late 1910s, before being elected to the league executive committee. Fry was the OHA's vice-president from 1920 to 1922, then served as president from 1922 to 1924.Young, Scott (1989), p. 347 He was acclaimed as president of the OHA, succeeding A. E. Copeland of Midland. Fry's executive committee included W. A. Hewitt as secretary, and J. F. Paxton as treasurer. Fry and his committee were re-elected in 1923. Fry represented the OHA at the 1923 general meeting of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) in Winnipeg. He asked for a discussion on body checking, and a clearer definition of what was legal. The CAHA declined to include women's hockey in its organization at the same meeting, and Fry voted against inclusion since he felt women had ample opportunity in other sports where physical contact was not a factor.Wong, John Chi-Kit (2009) p. 139 Fry nominated Toby Sexsmith for a second term as CAHA president explaining that a two-year term was necessary to be effective and familiar with the issues, rather than a customary one-year term. Fry recommended on behalf of the OHA to have the Toronto Granites as the 1923 Allan Cup champions represent Canada in ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics. After the Toronto Granites won gold at the 1924 Winter Olympics, he sat on the committee to arrange a victory reception for them. At the 1923 general meeting of the OHA, Fry introduced a motion to put $2,000 towards a World War I memorial educational scholarship at the University of Toronto for those who served in the Canadian Armed Forces. At the semi-annual CAHA meeting later in 1923, he made successful motions to eliminate commercial names from teams in the CAHA, and to strengthen the abilities for the provincial association to decide on matters under its jurisdiction. In April 1924, Fry spoke out against the migration of senior ice hockey players to the United States, without Canadian teams being compensated for developing those players. He looked for a working relationship between the CAHA and professional teams. At the 1924 general meeting of the CAHA, he requested better representation for Canada at the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which was represented by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU of C). On December 2, 1924, Fry was succeeded by William Easson of Stratford as president of the OHA. At the 1925 general meeting of the OHA, Fry advised on several issues as the past- president. He spoke against a proposal by Conn Smythe to have the Ontario Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union champion go directly into the Eastern Canada Allan Cup playoffs, that would bypass the OHA playoffs and not guarantee an Ontario representative in the Allan Cup.Young, Scott (1989), p. 163 When western provinces in Canada wanted to raise the junior age limit to 21, Fry noted that the OHA had more junior teams that the rest of the country combined, and there was no reason for \\"the tail to wag the dog\\", and keeping the lower age limit was a bargaining chip to gain concessions from professional teams.Young, Scott (1989), pp. 166‚Äì167 When proposals were tabled to prevent an OHA team from using any player who had a pending professional contract, he recommended seeking clarification from the AAU of C for the status of those players.Young, Scott (1989), p. 168 Canadian Amateur Hockey Association alt=Allan Cup trophy Fry was elected vice-president of the CAHA on March 26, 1926, and served in the role for two years.Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (1990). p. 126 In November 1926, he recommended profits from Allan Cup playoff games exceeding $5,000 be turned over to the CAHA whose work had earned the money, instead of Allan Cup trustees dictating how the money was spent. At the CAHA general meeting in March 1927, he formally requested to have the CAHA take control of the Allan Cup and its profits from the trustees, and use the funds to build amateur hockey in Canada. He felt the move justified as the CAHA had evolved and was able to manage its own affairs. His motion asked for H. Montagu Allan to donate the cup to the CAHA, and establish an Allan Cup committee which included current trustee William Northey. Fry was re-elected vice-president on March 28, 1927. He presided over the 1928 general meeting of the where commercial team names were discussed again, and the handling of expenses for the Canada men's national ice hockey team. Fry succeeded Frank Sandercock as president of the CAHA on March 29, 1928, and the Maritime Amateur Hockey Association was welcomed as a new branch of the CAHA. He was re-elected as CAHA president and AAU of C governor on March 29, 1929. During his tenures as president, he set up a separate finance committee to oversee income and expenditures Allan cup profits. He aimed to implement standardized ice hockey rules for all leagues under CAHA jurisdiction. He was also part of the AAU of C group which selected the first members of its committee to choose which teams would represent Canada at the Olympics. In response to the Trail Smoke Eaters being disqualified in the 1929 Allan Cup playoffs for an unsigned player, Fry motioned for any active professional athletes being banned from holding management positions on am amateur team. The CAHA executive set aside 5 percent of profits from Allan Cup and Memorial Cup games for a minor ice hockey development fund. At the end of his term as president, Fry stated that \\"remarkable progress\\" was made in Canadian amateur hockey with respect to growing interest in the playoffs for the Allan Cup and Memorial Cup, and loyalty to amateur principals of the AAU of C. On March 29, 1930, Fry was succeeded as CAHA president by Jack Hamilton. Fry was immediately named to a committee to establish a better relationship with the professional leagues. In May 1930, Fry and W. A. Hewitt attended the 1930 general meeting of the National Hockey League (NHL) asking for a better working agreement. The CAHA recommended players remain in amateur hockey until a year after graduating from junior hockey, and offered to sanction its players to attend NHL practices, and standardize playing rules with the NHL. The CAHA continued negotiations after the NHL appointed Conn Smythe and James Strachan to a working agreement committee. Results of the negotiations where discussed at the 1933 general meeting of the CAHA, and Fry recommended that players who unsuccessfully tried out for a professional team would still retain amateur status. Amateur Athletic Union of Canada =Committee member= Fry accompanied the Toronto Varsity Blues team (pictured) which won the gold medal representing Canada at the alt=Toronto Varsity Blues men's ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics. Fry was a standing committee member for the AAU of C from 1927 to 1934, and participated on the Canadian Olympic Committee and the British Empire Games committee. He regularly travelled to international sporting events at his own expense, on behalf of the CAHA and the AAU of C. At the 1927 AAU of C general meeting, he spoke against the intermingling of professionals and amateurs in baseball as proposed by Alberta, and wanted to keep amateurs separated. He accompanied the Toronto Varsity Blues men's ice hockey team won the gold medal representing Canada in ice hockey at the 1928 Winter Olympics hosted in St. Moritz, Switzerland. He was a committee member of the 1930 British Empire Games, hosted in Hamilton, Ontario. In November 1930, Fry gave a lengthy prepared speech in response to criticism of the management of amateur sport in Canada. He stated that, \\"I feel that we should reiterate our continued confidence and belief in our work, and our determination to pursue it to our objective\\". He further defended the CAHA and the AAU of C by stating, \\"There was never a time in the history of the world when civilization realized more its responsibility to our youth, to the unfortunates and underprivileged, and there is no nation in the world where more time and money is being spent in living up to that responsibility than in Canada\\". At the 1931 general meeting of the AAU of C, Fry was named to the legislation committee, and named chairman of the registration committee. He was also appointed as a member-at-large to the AAU of C executive committee. Fry served on the Canadian Olympic Committee's winter sports committee to prepare for the 1932 Winter Olympics hosted in Lake Placid, New York. When the 1931 Allan Cup champions Winnipeg Hockey Club were chosen to represent Canada in ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics, Fry said the team was the \\"best bet\\" Canada had in team sports at the Olympics. He accompanied the team to the 1932 Winter Olympics in which they won the gold medal representing Canada. Fry attended the 1932 Summer Olympics (opening ceremonies pictured) at alt=1932 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies Fry was named to the Canadian Olympic Committee's summer sports committee to prepare for the 1932 Summer Olympics hosted in Los Angeles, California. He was part of the delegation that went to Ottawa to lobby Edgar Nelson Rhodes, the Canadian Minister of Finance, for funds to cover travel expenses for athletes. He travelled with the Canadian delegation to Los Angeles, and self-published his own book covering Canadian achievements at the winter and summer games. His 1933 book, Canada at the tenth Olympiad, 1932 : Lake Placid, New York, Feb 4 to 13 - Los Angeles, California, July 30 to Aug. 14, was printed by the Dunnville Chronicle presses and dedicated to Canadian sportsperson Francis Nelson who died in 1932. At the 1932 general meeting of the AAU of C, delegates discussed whether professionals in one sport could play as an amateur in another sport. The association upheld current ban against it, but agreed to further study as to how it relates to the Olympic Games and international sporting organizations. Fry called for maintaining the ideals of amateur sport and said, \\"it was a question of implanting proper ideals in the young generation\\", and \\"to play the game for the game's sake\\". In February 1933, Fry was named again as chairman of registration committee, and as a member-at-large on the executive committee. He recommended suspension of the Alberta branch due to breaking AAU of C principles, when five active \\"class A\\" professionals were reinstated as amateurs. He and fellow executives met with members of the Alberta branch regarding not waiting long enough to reinstate former professionals as amateurs. They agreed that a proposal would be submitted for the next AAU of C general meeting to reinstate a \\"class A\\" professional after a two or three-month trial. The AAU of C made no suspensions, and the players in question were expected to apply for reinstatement at the general meeting. At the AAU of C general meeting in November 1933, Fry urged for means to keep branch registrations committees in close touch with the national committee. He requested the power for national committee to be able to act when irregularities were reported. The registration committee was empowered to reinstate athletes as amateurs who had not been professionals in three years. His resolution to allow professional and amateur teams to play each other in sanctioned games was defeated. Delegates to the meeting moved forward a proposal for players attending tryouts to remain as an amateur, after Fry had explained that the CAHA would not change its mind on the matter whether or not approved by the AAU of C. In 1934, Fry was named chairman of the Canadian delegation committee to the 1934 British Empire Games. He oversaw the pregame trials in Canada, and travel arrangements to the games in London, England. AAU of C president J. Howard Crocker declined another term due to health reasons, and Fry became the presumed heir since he had been appointed vice-president for the last two years. =President= First term alt=University of Manitoba administration building Fry was acclaimed as president of the AAU of C on November 18, 1934. He took over the reigns at a time when The Canadian Press reported the AAU of C was losing direct control of amateur sport, since the Canadian Track and Field Association was no longer under its direct control. The Winnipeg Free Press stated that the AAU of C was \\"on the verge of becoming a registration only organization\\". The AAU of C set up a committee to oversee amateur boxing and amateur wrestling which were still under its control, and decided to reduce its expenses by sending a smaller delegation of Canada's best chances to win medals at the upcoming Olympic Games. Fry also named himself chairman of the amateur reinstatement committee. The AAU of C recommended to its branches to spend a portion of registration fees to promote and increase team sports. In December 1934, the University of Manitoba appealed to Fry and the AAU of C regarding a decision by the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA) which did not require university students be released from a private club team to play for the school team. Fry agreed with the university, stating that students are under the jurisdiction of the school unless released by the school to play for a club team. He also stated that AAU of C rulings should be respected by affiliated organizations, such as the MAHA. In January 1935, Fry warned Canadian amateur sports bodies to beware of persons looking to profit from sport. He reminded everyone that the AAU of C was there for sport's sake and for the youth, whereas professional leagues were antagonistic and would stop at nothing to make a profit. He cautioned sports bodies of being too accommodating towards professional requests, and cautioned AAU of C branches against misinterpreting rules for their own benefit to register athletes. Fry sought a better working arrangement with the United States' Amateur Athletic Union to track the movement of athletes across the border. He later upheld a decision by the OHA which prevented players who went to the United States from returning to competition in Ontario. At the 1935 CAHA general meeting, he supported a by James T. Sutherland to establish more cooperation with professional teams, and speak out against the continuous raiding of amateur team rosters midseason. Fry reversed his stand in 1932, and now felt it was okay for professionals in one sport to be registered as an amateur in another sport. Delegates to the 1935 general meeting of the AAU of C voted against allowing any mixing of amateur and professionals. The same meeting saw Fry allow the AAU of C's advisory committee on the Women's Amateur Athletic Federation to investigate cancelling an affiliation with the federation due to internal problems within the women's group. alt=The Ottawa Rough Riders playing against the Toronto Argonauts in 1924 On November 19, 1935, Toronto's The Mail and Empire accused the Ottawa Rough Riders of using an illegal player in a recent match against the Toronto Argonauts. Editor Edwin Allen stated that the player \\"Roy Berry\\" was an alias for Bohn Hilliard, a Texas Longhorns footballer who had played semi-professional baseball. The Ottawa branch of the AAU of C took a strict view of amateurism, and called for the suspension of all players in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU) who played against Hilliard, which would also prevent any IRFU team from playing for the 23rd Grey Cup. A day later, Fry stated the Ottawa branch had no authority to suspend IRFU players, but cautioned playing against Ottawa until the issue was rectified. On November 22, 1935, Fry suspended the entire Ottawa team citing proof of an illegal player, but lifted the suspensions a day later when empowered by the AAU of C executive to deal with future developments from this as he saw fit. In February 1936, Fry announced the suspension of nine members of the Ottawa team from amateur sport. Second term Fry was re-elected president of the AAU of C on November 23, 1935, at the general meeting. At the same time, the AAU of C adopted resolutions to ask its sports bodies to investigate and eliminate hypocrisy and dishonesty in the pursuit of profits. The union imposed a one-month delay for players transferring to Canada before a registration card would be issued, to give time to investigate a player's background and amateur eligibility. Fry had proposed to declining registration to players who had not been out of professional sports in the last three years, but the union rejected the idea. He later appointed Jack W. Hamilton as chairman of the AAU of C registration committee, which The Canadian Press reported was the most important committee within the AAU of C. Fry attended the alt=Aerial view of Garmisch- Partenkirchen, Germany The AAU of C had yet to decide by November 1935, which team would represent Canada in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics, since the Halifax Wolverines who were the most recent 1935 Allan Cup champions had disbanded. Fry stated attempts were made to bring the Wolverines team back together for the Olympics, but its players had gone separate ways for personal and financial reasons. In December 1935, he announced the Port Arthur Bearcats who were runners up in the 1935 Allan Cup, as \\"the logical choice\\" to represent Canada. In January 1936, four members of the Wolverines were invited to play with Port Arthur at the Olympics, but declined when travel expenses were not covered for their families. Fry defended the decision by CAHA president E. A. Gilroy and the AAU of C, stating that it was not their responsibility to cover expenses beyond the players. Canada's dominance at the Olympic hockey tournament ended in 1936, when the Great Britain men's national ice hockey team which included British-Canadian dual citizens captured the gold medal over Canada who won silver. In the wake of Canada not winning the Olympic gold medal, the CAHA pushed for changes and proposed a new definition of amateur at the April 1936 general meeting of the CAHA, which were contrary to existing AAU of C principles. The new definition mentioned four points including; payments allowed for work time lost while playing games, players are allowed to make money as a hockey player but not have a second job, professional and amateur teams could play one another in games sanctioned by the CAHA, and professionals in another sport could be amateurs in hockey. The Winnipeg Tribune speculated that support would be strong for the measures which could cut ties with the AAU of C, and the \\"old guard\\" of amateurism would lose. Fry was in attendance at the meeting, and cautioned delegates that the decision was \\"the most important matter ever to come before an amateur body in Canada\\". He further stated, \\"It would be a sorry day for the AAU of C should it split with its strongest supporter, the CAHA. As a former CAHA president, he sympathized with the resolution, but did not give approval. Fry was reported to have agreed with the first three points, but disagreed with professionals in one sport being amateurs in hockey. Journalist W. G. Allen noted that Fry had changed his mind again when it came to professionals in one sport being amateurs in another. In May 1936, Fry stated in a letter to the new CAHA president Cecil Duncan, that the AAU of C would not entertain proposals to change the definition of amateur. Fry went on to say that changing the definition of amateur would sever ties with the AAU of C, and leave the CAHA not in good standing with the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG), meaning that Canada could not play in the Olympics, World Championships, and go on exhibition tours. Duncan was critical of Fry for publishing quotes from the letter in the Dunnville Chronicle, before the letter was received. CAHA first vice-president W. G. Hardy asserted that Fry broke a promise to conduct a mail-in vote of AAU of C to decide on the matter, and consider updating the antiquated definition of amateur at the next AAU of C general meeting. CAHA second vice-president George Dudley referred to Fry as \\"Somersault Bill\\", due to the changing stand on the vote. In defending the AAU of C definition of amateur, journalist Ralph Allen compared Fry to a captain sinking with his ship. IOC president Avery Brundage defended Fry and the \\"old guard\\" position on amateurism, and eligibility for the Olympics. Berlin's Olympic Stadium pictured).alt=1936 Summer Olympics at Berlin's Olympic Stadium Fry travelled with the Canadian delegation to 1936 Summer Olympics hosted in Berlin, and self-published a second book on Canadian achievements. His 1936 book, Canada at eleventh Olympiad 1936 in Germany : Garmisch- Partenkirchen, February 6 to 13, Berlin, August 1 to 16, was printed by the Dunnville Chronicle presses and subtitled an official report of the Canadian Olympic Committee. He wrote that Canadians did very well at the 1936 Olympic games despite having one-tenth of the population of other countries. He opined that the length of the Canadian winter negatively affected summer training, and that Canadian athletes were underfunded compared to other countries. In October 1936, Fry called for AAU of C branches to attend the upcoming general meeting in November, and uphold \\"the continued safeguarding\\" of amateur principles. The statement was made after the British Columbia branch sponsored a change to the amateur definition in the Canadian Lacrosse Association and the Canadian Amateur Basketball Association (CABA), and in reference to the \\"four points\\" changes by the CAHA. He stated that during his visit to the 1936 Summer Olympics, he was assured by the LIHG and the International Amateur Athletic Federation would not recognize organizations who supported professionalism in sports. At the AAU of C general meeting in November 1936, the CABA threatened withdrawal unless grievances were resolved over registrations. Fry's motion was passed that made three years become the waiting period to be reinstated as an amateur. Delegates rejected three of the CAHA's four points, accepting only exhibition games between amateurs and professionals. The status of the alliance with the CAHA was left in limbo and unclear. The general meeting concluded on November 23, 1936, with Jack Hamilton succeeding Fry as president of the AAU of C . =Past-president= Fry served on the committee for the Canadian delegation to the 1938 British Empire Games, hosted in Australia at the alt=Sydney Cricket Ground during the 1930s. In May 1937, Fry was named to the AAU of C committee for the Canadian delegation at the 1938 British Empire Games hosted in Sydney, Australia. Fry remained vocal in his opposition to growing professionalism in sport. AAU of C vice-president Sydney Halter tabled a proposal in November 1937, which allowed each member sports association to accept the definition of amateurism as defined by its respective international sport governing body, in an attempt to reunite the associations under the AAU of C umbrella. Fry stated that the AAU of C should not allow payments to amateur athletes as was now allowed by the CAHA. In November 1938, he was appointed to a commission to explore uniting the four separate branches in the AAU of C in Ontario. Fry attended 25th anniversary banquet of the CAHA at the Royal Alexandra Hotel in Winnipeg in April 1939, which included 11 of the 13 past presidents. Honours and awards Fry was made a life member of the CAHA on April 6, 1932, and was made a life member of the OHA in 1934. He was appointment to Ontario Athletic Commission in 1937, by Mitchell Hepburn, the Premier of Ontario. His appointment to the Commission was honoured at a banquet in Toronto on January 10, 1938, where he was presented a silver plate by the OHA. Fry was made an honorary president of the Haldimand County Hunters and Anglers Association, and the Hamilton Old Boys Football Association. He also had honorary membership bestowed upon him by the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club, the Dunnville Kinsmen Club, the officer's mess of the Dufferin-Haldimand Rifles of Canada, and the officer's mess of the No.6 Service Flying Training School. Personal life Fry met and married his wife Pearl Campbell while in Ingersoll for work. He and his wife had one son and three daughters. The couple maintained a residence in Dunnville, and a summer cottage on the Lake Erie shore. He was a member of both the Dunnville Golf and Country Club and the lawn bowling club. He called Hamilton, Ontario his adopted city, and frequently travelled there to attend home games for the Hamilton Tigers football club. Death and legacy alt=Fry's gravestone Fry died at the Hamilton General Hospital, on Friday, April 21, 1944. He was interred at Riverside Cemetery in Dunnville. The Dunnville Chronicle and the Welland Tribune reported that Fry was well known throughout the Niagara Peninsula, and that his funeral was well-attended by members of the sports associations with which he served. He was remembered by journalist and former Olympian Bobbie Rosenfeld as a man who fought for true amateurism in sport, in the face of growing professionalism. His son, William C. Fry, took charge of the Dunnville Chronicle in 1944. In 1961, the business was purchased by County Newspapers Limited, becoming part of the Thomson Newspapers chain. The paper later became part of Sun Media, who published the paper until closing operations due to cost-cutting measures. The final issue of the Dunnville Chronicle was issued on November 28, 2012, 116 years after its founding by Fry.

Developed between 1891 and 1929, the district is a collection of single-family homes, small apartment buildings, and a handful of larger apartment hotels. The homes were built early in the district's development, with nearly all of them completed by 1910; at the time, the district was planned as a spacious suburb and categorized with North Shore communities. The apartments were all built in the twentieth century as the dense city core of Chicago expanded into the district. The district includes a large collection of six-flat apartments in particular; small apartments such as these, which were only three stories tall, fit neatly among the single-family houses of the original neighborhood. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 1985.https://www.chicago.gov/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Dover_Street_District.pdf Despite the federal historic designation, in the 1990s and 2000s, many of the finer homes in the district were torn down to be replaced with new condominium developments. These teardowns included the oldest home in the district located on the 4600 block of North Beacon Street. Teardowns in the district continue and most recently in early 2020, two mixed-use, residential-commercial buildings on the east side of the 4600 block of North Clark Street were demolished. The lack of protection afforded by the federal historic district designation led residents on Dover Street in 2005 to begin seeking city landmark district designation. The process was completed in 2007. Since that time, a number of historic properties on Dover Street have been successfully renovated and expanded while maintaining their historic facades. Among the noteworthy architects whose work can be found on Dover Street are James Gamble Rogers, who later designed many buildings for Northwestern and Yale universities, and E.E. Roberts, a prairie-school contemporary of Frank LLoyd Wright.

He is best known for co-founding Vodien Internet Solutions, growing it to be the largest hosting provider in Singapore.  Early life and education  Poh was born in Singapore. He came from a working-class family in Kovan, where his mother worked as a clinical assistant while his father worked multiple jobs. Poh has claimed that the lack of an allowance spurred him to find ways to have an income, and eventually was one of the reasons that led him to co-found the company with his school-mate. After nearly flunking out of high school, Poh started focusing on his grades. Eventually, he managed to do well enough to become a scholarship recipient of the National Infocomm Scholarship, which provided for his university education. He made the Dean's List for both years that he was in Singapore Management University and graduated with a BSc (IS Management) summa cum laude, from Singapore Management University, and winning the Monetary Authority of Singapore Academic Excellence Award. He also graduated with a MSc (IS Management) summa cum laude from Carnegie Mellon University.  Career  In 2002, Poh was 17 when he co-founded his first company, Vodien Studios, a web design firm that provided services such as graphic design, web design, web development, and web hosting services. Later, the company pivoted, restructuring and removing several business functions and services. In August 2005, Vodien Studios renamed itself Vodien Internet Solutions and became a specialised web hosting services provider. On July 30, 2009, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore approved the incorporation of Vodien Internet Solutions Pte Ltd, a registered private limited company to reflect the next stage of the company's growth. Subsequently, the company grew rapidly over the next decade. In July 2017, Poh sold the business to Dreamscape Networks (DN8:ASX), a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, most popularly known for operating the domain name registry, Crazy Domains. The deal was valued at SGD30 million, and allowed the combined entity to expand into Southeast Asia through Singapore. In July 2018, Poh stepped down from his position as Vodien's CEO and currently remains as a significant shareholder of Dreamscape Networks, where Poh owns 5.5 per cent of the company.  Philanthropy  Poh's philanthropy work focuses primarily on tertiary education. In 2018, Poh donated to and created the Alvin Poh Endowed Scholarship at Singapore Management University with a donation of SGD250,000.

At the time of description there were only two known specimens of S. clypeata, but now there are at least six known specimens. In 2012 a second species S. buckorum was described from the Emu Bay Shale of Australia.  Etymology  The genus Squamacula is derived from the Latin word squama, meaning scale, and the diminutive suffix -culus, indicating that the animal is relatively small. The species clypeata is derived from the Latin word clypeatus, meaning shield- shaped. It was named this in reference to its shield-like outline.  Description  Squamacula clypeata is flattened (dorsoventrally). It has 11 segments in total: the cephalon (the head), nine thoracic tergites (each of which covers a somite), and one pygidium. It has a doublure, a piece of exoskeleton that covers part of the underside of the animal. Its doublure is, on average, about twice as long as the length of its cephalon. It has been hypothesized that this large doublure could have aided the animal in digging through sediment to find food, as it was thought to have been both a predator of small animals and a scavenger. Squamacula clypeata has one pair of antennae attached to its cephalon, but no other appendages or auditory or visual structures. No mouth is present in the specimens, but the gut is present, so S. clypeata must have had a mouth, which is thought to have been between the cephalon and doublure on the underside. Squamacula clypeata has one pair of biramous appendages (an appendage which branches into two) per thoracic tergite. The endopod (inside branch) has seven segments, the first six of which are roughly even in size and shape, with small spines on the underside, and the last of which terminates with a claw and appears to have been used for walking and eating, as the claw could be useful in grabbing hold of and tearing up food. The exopod (outside branch) was not segmented, but flap-like, with setae (bristles) near the tip, which may have been used for both locomotion and respiration.

Lynching of Paul Jones On Sunday, November 2, 1919, Paul Jones allegedly attacked a white woman about outside of Macon. Paul Jones was chased through town until he was cornered in a rail boxcar, there the woman positively identified him. A white mob of 400 people quickly assembled and over the protests of Sheriff James R. Hicks they seized Jones. His body was riddled with bullets, \\"saturated with coal oil\\" and lit on fire. He was still alive as the flames consumed his body and the mob watched as he writhed in pain. There were no arrests. Aftermath These race riots were one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so- called American Red Summer of 1919, which included terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively.

Prosecution for adultery per se ceased to be possible in English law in 1970.  Early medieval England  Prior to the unification of England in the tenth century, various forms of adultery were punishable in laws codified by Anglo-Saxon kings.Theodore John Rivers, 'Adultery in Early Anglo- Saxon Society: √Üthelberht 31 in Comparison with Continental Germanic Law', Anglo-Saxon England, 20 (1991), 19-25 .Jeremy D. Weinstein, 'Adultery, Law, and the State: A History', Hastings Law Journal, 38.1 (1986), 195-238. These laws usually conceptualised what is now called adultery in terms of damage to men's property, since women were understood to be under the control of male relatives or, after marriage, their husbands. Compensation payments were linked, as in many other kinds of crime, to the social rank of the offended man, and the laws do not indicate a religious dimension to the conceptualisation of adultery in the law. The probably seventh-century Law of √Üthelberht, king of Kent, permitted men to seek compensation or revenge in cases where men had sex with women under their control. Clause 31, for example, reads 'if a freeman lies with [another] free-man's wife, he shall pay [the husband] his wergeld and procure a second wife with his own money, and bring her to the other man's home'. The ninth-century Laws of Alfred of Wessex include similar provisions, including an explicit statement that it was legal for one man to attack another 'if he finds another with his wedded wife, behind closed doors or under the same blanket; or [if he finds another man] with his legitimate daughter (or with his legitimate married sister); or with his mother, if she has been legally married to his father'. Following the unification of England around the early tenth century, English kings promulgated further law-codes that began to conceptualise adultery in terms of Christian sin. These included the law codes of Cnut. Not unlike previous laws, the code specified fines in the case of an adulterous husband, or religious penance in cases viewed as minor (adultery with a slave), but also prescribed corporal mutilation for female adulterers‚Äîcutting off their nose and ears‚Äîas well as the forfeiture of all the woman's property to her husband. Although Cnut's laws show the influence of Wulfstan, Archbishop of York, it has been argued that this violent punishment of women reflects long-standing custom that had simply not previously been codified rather than religious influence.A. L. Klinck, 'Anglo-Saxon Women and the Law', Journal of Medieval History, 8.2 (1982), 107‚Äì21 (p. 111); . Later medieval England The principle that men might legally kill adulterers found with women under their control persisted following the Norman Conquest in the Leis Willelmi, but the Leges Henrici Primi of around 1114-18 decreed that the King should have the executive authority to punish an adulterous man, and that adulterous women should be punished by bishops. During the twelfth century, as English common law emerged, the punishment of adultery was shifted from the secular authorities to the ecclesiastical ones. Ecclesiastical authorities did not impose death penalties, but the killing of a male adulterer by a male cuckold was not outlawed in secular law, leaving scope for lawful revenge-killing. In time, however, adultery came exclusively to be a concern of the Church courts, and was not a crime at common law. There is evidence, however, that local secular courts sometimes exercised judgements in adultery cases; in one thirteenth-century or early fourteenth-century case, for example, a monk was put in the stocks for adultery. Moreover, juries would at times refuse to condemn cuckolds who killed adulterers in flagrante delicto, in practice facilitating the ancient custom of revenge-killing by cuckolds. Meanwhile, although adultery might not be prosecuted in the secular courts per se, adulterous acts might become part of the basis for prosecution for rape or abduction, though by the late fifteenth century such prosecutions had fallen out of use. Modern period Ecclesiastical jurisdiction over adultery cases continued from the medieval period until the passage of the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857 brought jurisdiction over marriage, divorce and adultery from the ecclesiastical courts into the secular ones. Ecclesiastical punishments for adultery prior to 1857 involved forms of penance, sometimes public, such as appearing before the parish congregation in a penitential white sheet.Marita Carnelley, 'Laws on Adultery: Comparing the Historical Development of South African Common-law Principles with those in English Law', Fundamina (Pretoria), 19.2 (February 2013), 185-211. Adultery was outlawed in secular statute law briefly under the Commonwealth of England in the 1650s. Following a long series of attempts to legislate against adultery in Parliament which failed to win the vote, the Rump Parliament passed the Commonwealth (Adultery) Act in May 1650, inter alia imposing the death penalty on both men and women for adultery. However, like all legislation passed by the Commonwealth, the act was repealed following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660.J.P. Kenyon, \\"The Interregnum, 1649‚Äì1660\\" in J.P. Kenyon, The Stuart Constitution (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1969) page 330 However, during the early modern period, it did become possible to prosecute for adultery in English common law due to developments in the common-law concept of loss of consortium, which made it possible for a cuckold to bring a civil case against an adulterer under tort law. 'Consortium' in this context means '(the right of) association and fellowship between two married people';\\"consortium, n.\\", OED Online, 1st edn (Oxford University Press), accessed 3 November 2019. 'loss of consortium' was an act that deprived one spouse (initially only the husband) of the services which the other spouse was expected to provide. In the 1619 case Guy v. Livesey, it is clear that precedent had been established by that time that exclusive access to sexual services was considered to fall within the concept of 'consortium', and that an adulterer might therefore be prosecuted for depriving a cuckold of exclusive access to the sexual services of his wife. From the early eighteenth century, the term for this kind of crime came to be 'criminal conversation' (where 'conversation' is a euphemism for 'sexual intercourse').\\"criminal, adj. and n.\\", OED Online, 3rd edn (Oxford University Press), accessed 3 November 2019. Another avenue for prosecuting an adulterer for loss of consortium was to accuse them of 'enticement' (wooing a spouse such that she desired to leave her husband). The possibility of seeking damages against an adulterer in tort law persisted until the passage of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1970. Adultery also had an important position in English law to the extent that between 1660 and 1857 it was the only possible ground for divorce, and between 1857 and the Divorce Reform Act 1969 it was one of a limited range of legal grounds for divorce. Successful prosecution might lead the complainant to win damages from the adulterer (though these did not extend in function to being punitive or exemplary). Adultery ceased to be specified as a basis for divorce with the passage of the Family Law Act 1996.

The chieftaincy was named after the town of Gidhaur in Jamui district but its territory extended into the wider region. Origins Lalkothi palace which belonged to the Gidhaur estate The Gidhaur chieftaincy was founded by Bir Bikram Shah who was a Chandel Rajput. The family accounts detail that his family originally held a small chieftaincy in Mahoba in Bundelkhand but were driven out by various foreign incursions including the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni. From here they arrived in the Rewa area where they established the estate of Bardi(khatai). Bir Bikram Shah, who was the younger brother of the chief of Bardi(khatai), left his home and arrived in South Bihar where he established his power in the region by defeating the Dusadh chief, Nagoria in 1262. From here, he continued to expand the extent of his chiefdom. The Gidhaur chiefs were part of a larger movement of Rajput immigrants into Bihar from the 13th century onwards which included the rulers of Kharagpur Raj and Deo Raj. History =Mughal period= After Bir Bikram Shah's death in 1339, he was succeeded by various descendants however Raghunath Singh was the first of his descendants to receive much attention in sources from the time. The 16th-century historian, Abbas Sarwani noted that Raghunath Singh accepted the rule of Sher Shah Suri and assisted him in his war against Humayun. Such was Sher Shah's trust in him, that he was even deputed to escort Saif Khan. His son was Bariar Singh who ruled Gidhaur till 1572. After Bariar Singh came Raja Puran Mal who was a contemporary of the Mughal Emperor Akbar. In 1580, Puran Mal joined a rebellion against the imperial authority which was led by Masum Khan Kabuli. Abu Fazl detailed that Puran Mal rescued Masum Khan and his soldiers from Munger where they were trapped by Mughal soldiers. Puran Mal's disloyalty to the Mughal's seems to have been temporary however as later sources note that he served with the Mughal commander, Shahbaz Khan Kamboh in an expedition against the Afghans. His son, Hari Singh, was kept as a hostage for the Mughals to ensure his continued compliance with the imperial authority. Puran Mal also engaged in multiple clashes with the neighbouring chief of Kharagpur Raj, Sangram Singh. After Pural Mal's death, the chiefs of Gidhaur seemed to have maintained their loyalty to the Mughal authorities and supported them in various expeditions. In the war of succession between Dara Shikoh and Shah Shuja in 1658, both princes appealed for the assistance of Raja Dal Singh of Gidhaur who ended up supporting the former. =British period= The British East India Company assumed control of the region in the 18th century. The Gidhaur chief, Raja Jai Mangal Singh assisted them during the suppression of Santhal rebellion and the Indian rebellion of 1857. For his services, he was granted the title of Maharaja and made an Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1865.

The company, which was founded by the Hasterlik family, was one of many German-owned breweries in Chicago at the time. Architect Oscar Beyer designed the building, which features decorative brickwork, arched windows, and a cornice. The company brewed beer at the plant until Prohibition, when it switched to other goods such as ice and malt syrup. After Prohibition ended, the company began brewing beer again, and it brought innovations to the Chicago market such as canned beer and private labels for the chain stores it sold to. While the company was bought out by the Metropolis Brewing Company of New York City in 1950, beer was brewed at the plant until 1961.

The building dates to Timurid Era, 1437-1438 is located north of Varamin, near local railway station and is located in the city's main cemetery. The building was enlisted among National Works of Iran in 20 December 2000 by the number 2937.  Architecture  The building is octagonal with a recessed blind arch on each face. It was originally free-standing, but at a much later stage an entrance aiwan was built against the east side and a small domed tomb against the south side. Two of the original four entrances have been blocked up. Brickwork is the sole means of exterior decoration. The bricks measure 23 x 23 x 6 cm., many re-used ones being employed. The brickwork is clumsy. Angled bricks were not used on the corners; the ensuing vertical gap was covered by a thick coat of brownish mortar. The mortar and bricks in vertical lay at the top of the octagon and on the dome differ in color from those used elsewhere on the monument; they are undoubtedly indicative of restoration. A pyramidal roof may have been intended originally. Although the height of the tomb tower is only slightly greater than its width, a strong feeling of verticality is created by the tall blind arches on each panel. Unusually, no scaffold holes are visible on the exterior. The interior is square with four recesses. All surfaces are covered with plaster, which has recently been given an unhappy coating of green on the inscription, light blue below it and white above. The lower panels have modern round arches. The zone of transition is divided into eight and sixteen-sided areas. an Aluminium zarih was installed inside the tomb in 1991. The most interesting feature of the mausoleum is its stucco decoration. Two patterns are used to frame the arches of the squinch zone; one, mainly geometrical, round the squinch arches, the other mainly vegetal, round the arches in between. The elegant thulth inscription just below the squinch zone begins on the back wall of the west recess. A Quranic scription accompanied the following phrase at the end:\\"At the beginning of the month of Jumdda I year 841 \\"/November 1437. The decade of the figure is not quite clear; a case could also be made for 821. Structurally the monument presents no innovations. The fourteenth century tomb towers of Qom, e.g. the Imamzada Ja'far, present close parallels. Had the monument not been dated one might have been tempted to ascribe it to the fourteenth century. The remains of stucco decoration on the double minaret portal at Qum was probably one factor in its attribution to c. 1325 when in fact the date 830/1426-27 is preserved on one of the minarets.The importance of the Imamzada Husain Rida lies in the extension of the terminus ante quem for this type of stucco decoration, which had died out by the middle of the fifteenth century.

In March 1592 he was thought to be in hiding in Northumberland with the earl, the Laird of Niddry, and others who had tried to access the king's presence by force at Holyroodhouse. In June 1592 he was declared guilty of treason in the Parliament of Scotland. In November 1592 Hercules and a number of Bothwell's supporters, including John Wemyss of Logie, were pardoned for their treasons.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 650, 687, 818, 821.

A pulsed plasma thruster (PPT) provides propulsion. It is the first PPT to use sulfur as a fuel. Students at Raisbeck Aviation High School designed an onboard camera. The satellite will test an experimental 24 GHz data transmitter, after which it will become an amateur radio satellite operated by AMSAT. The high data rate will enable much more data to be transferred during the 9- to 15-minute time windows the satellite is visible from the control station.

She is an associate professor of Physics and Astrophysics, University of Toronto, Scarborough, and of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Toronto. Valencia, with her Ph.D. advisory team of Richard J. O'Connell and Dimitar D. Sasselov at Harvard University, coined the term Super-Earths to describe extra-solar planets (solid) with masses up to ten times Earth‚Äôs mass. Valencia‚Äôs research characterizes planets with masses between gas giants and Earth‚Äôs. Biography Diana Valencia immigrated from Colombia to Canada with her parents while working toward a B.A. in Physics from University of Los Andes, Colombia. Though from a family of engineers, she intended to become a historian or economist in Colombia. Ultimately, she was influenced by her chemical engineer mother, despite her mother's misogynistic experiences in Colombia. Once in Canada, she realized there were career opportunities for women in the sciences and earned a B.A., then M.S. in Physics at University of Toronto. Valencia was inspired to apply for post- graduate programs and was accepted into Harvard University as a doctoral student. A simple question from a professor provided one of her greatest academic motivations: What would the Earth be like if it were twice its mass? From this point she dedicated herself to extra-solar planet investigations. Valencia's success in her career includes being the mother of two children, a son and a daughter. Selected academic work In 2006, Valencia's first major publication, \\"Internal Structure of Massive Terrestrial Planets\\", proposed the first mass-radius relationship for rocky exoplanets that associated mass, radius, and internal structure of solid planets more massive than Earth. 2007's publication, \\"Radius and Structure Models of the First Super-Earth Planet\\", recognized that exoplanets of different compositions would have different mass and radius measurements as quantified by degeneracy pressures, including exoplanets with iron cores, rocky mantles, and icy/liquid shells. Recognizing that human interest in the habitability of extra-solar planets drives much of their investigation, and that plate tectonics plays an important role in life on Earth, another 2007 publication, \\"Inevitability of Plate Tectonics on Super-Earths\\", was the first published investigation to propose that larger-massed terrestrial planets should experience plate tectonics due to thinner, weaker lithospheres and higher stresses. In 2013, \\"Bulk Composition of GJ 1214b and Other Sub-Neptunian Exoplanets\\", attempts to show an atmospheric exoplanet's composition was attained based on planetary mass and radius, and its evolution and internal characteristics. 2018‚Äôs \\"Habitability from Tidally Induced Tectonics\\" introduced the mechanism of vertical recycling of carbon through a planet's volcanic activity and sequestered carbon onto, and with, the basaltic oceanic crust settling (\\"foundering\\") and re-entering the mantle. This heat-pipe tectonism is equivalent to Earth's plate tectonics, enabling carbon-silicate cycling, thereby maintaining Earth habitable for billions of years. \\"Can a Machine Learn the Outcome of Planetary Collisions?\\", published 2019, explores improved methods of predicting the outcome of planetary collisions thought to be important in the last stages of planet formation. This machine learning approach seems a promising avenue. The methodology identifies variables needing further investigation to build better predictive models as large ratio of target to impactor masses and low velocities.

Sir Thomas Cokayne or Cockayne (27 November 1520 ‚Äî 15 November 1592) was an English soldier, huntsman, and MP for Derbyshire in March 1553. Early life and education Thomas Cokayne was born on 27 November 1520 to Francis Cokayne of Ashbourne, Derbyshire and his wife, Dorothy (daughter and heiress of Thomas Marrow of Berkswell). He was born into the family of Cokayne, who first settled in Ashbourne in the mid-12th-century, and were one of the oldest families in Derbyshire, obtaining many estates in their home county, Staffordshire, and Warwickshire. On 5 August 1538, aged 18, Cokayne came into his father's inheritance. Francis had been the head of the family for only 16 months, and his death left the underage Cokayne its new head. The following year, he was admitted to Gray's Inn, and Cokayne put himself into the service of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury. Military career Cokayne, like his grandfather, Thomas Cokayne \\"the Magnificent\\", was a keen soldier, commended by contemporaries as \\"a bold and [...] worthy knight\\". In 1544, he took part in the Rough Wooing of Scotland, alongside Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, and was knighted on 11 May 1544, for his part in the Burning of Edinburgh. In a 13 August 1548 muster, he was listed among the captains selected \\"For the Battaile\\", as part of the relief for George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury at the Siege of Haddington. Later in life, Cokayne credited \\"many extraordinary favours\\" to the earls of Shrewsbury, evidently grateful for his military service. He served under Henry VIII in France; attended the Field of Cloth of Gold, a 1520 diplomatic summit between Henry and Francis I of France; and was among those who, in the reign of Elizabeth I, confronted the Spanish Armada at the Battle of Gravelines. In 1587, on her way to her final imprisonment and eventual execution at Fotheringhay Castle, he attended Mary, Queen of Scots' travel \\"with but a small trayne\\" as far as Derby. He was evidently a trusted subject, selected on this occasion as \\"sound in religion [...] and faithful to her Majesty\\". Public offices and duties According to C. J. Black, writing for The History of Parliament: \\"under Elizabeth, Cokayne was evidently one of the local pillars of church and state\\". His first public office was as the commissary of musters for Derbyshire in 1546 (an office he held again in 1577 and 1584). From thereon, he held the offices of Justice of the peace for Derbyshire in 1547, 1555, and for Warwickshire in 1554, alongside sheriff for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from 1549‚Äì50 and 1559‚Äì60, and Derbyshire alone from 1569‚Äì70, 1579‚Äì80, and 1585‚Äì6. Occupying these offices, he effectively \\"wielded authority in his shire\\" according to Black. He held several more miscellaneous offices: commissary for relief in 1550, for subsidy in 1563, and \\"to inquire into Jesuits and seminarists\\" in 1585; keeper of Ravensdale Park in May 1553; collector for loans in Derbyshire in 1562; and steward for the manors of Ashbourne and Hartington by 1590. In the parliament of March 1553, Cokayne was the Member of Parliament for Derbyshire. He probably obtained this office thanks to the lobbying of the Earl of Shrewsbury, as the Earl had been vocal in his support of summoning the parliament; this was no doubt assisted by Cokayne's previous qualifications as a soldier, sheriff and justice of the constituency. Black gives no detail on his actions during this occupancy past a pithy statement that he \\"was probably more happily seated on a horse than in the Commons\\". Cockayne performed several less official duties as a respected and Conformist subject. In 1564, he advised Scottish Protestant, Thomas Bentham, on the religious conformity of his fellow justices of the peace in Derbyshire; he was charged with investigating the dispute between the Earl of Shrewsbury and his Glossopdale tenantry in 1581; he questioned a correspondent of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1584; and he impounded the belongings of the Derbyshire-born attempted assassin of Elizabeth, Anthony Babington, in 1586. He showed his faith in the crown with a donation of ¬£50 to the Armada loan in 1588. A Short Treatise of Hunting (1591) Dog in the frontispiece of the Treatise (1591). Being \\"a professed hunter, and not a scholler\\", as he admitted in its dedication, Cokayne compiled a collection of hunting tips in old age \\"for the delight of noblemen and gentlemen\\", and published them under the title A Short Treatise of Hunting in 1591. With 52 years' experience in hunting, Cokayne was quick to commend the sport as a pastime; \\"hunters\\", he wrote in its preface, \\"by their continual travail, painful labour, often watching, and enduring of hunger, of heat, and of cold, are much enabled above others to the service of their prince and country to the wars [...] and their minds also by this honest recreation the more fit and the better disposed to all other good exercises\\". He also drew attention to its use in saving England \\"from the hurt of foxes and other ravenous vermine\\". Though he was wont to shield hunting from the \\"carping speaches of the enemies thereof\\", he warned his readers against using the sport as \\"an occupation to spend therein daies, moneths, and yeres, to the hinderance of the service of God, her maistie or your Countrey\\". Cokayne dedicated the Treatise to his patron, the 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, and illustrated the book with woodcuts of various game animals. Personal life, death and monument Marble monument to Thomas Cockayne and his wife Dorothy in St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. About 1540 (and definitely by 1545), he married Dorothy, the daughter of Sir Humphrey Ferrers of Tamworth (his stepfather). Thomas and Dorothy had seven daughters and three sons. Their joint funerary monument lists their children in Latin as: Cokayne was frequently visited by the chronicler Raphael Holinshed, Holinshed being a steward of an estate neighbouring Cokayne's Pooley Hall in Warwickshire. Cokayne composed his will on 8 December 1591, naming Dorothy and Francis, his eldest son, as his executors, with Sir Humphrey Ferrers and Sir Edward Littleton as supervisors. His will made mention of a previous incident, \\"in regard of some debts he was then entered into\\", that made him mistrust Francis, but by the time of his death, he evidently had no misgivings. Cokayne specifically mentioned that his executors \\"use no vain pomp nor foolish ceremonies which I have always accounted superstitions\\" in his funeral. Cokayne died on 15 November 1592 and was buried that night; Dorothy died 3 years later, on 21 December 1595. After their deaths, Thomas and Dorothy had a joint memorial raised in St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. Many of his ancestors had similar memorials in the church, but Thomas was the last of the family to erect one. The monument is a large alabaster and marble tomb in the Renaissance style. Its main feature is a recess, where full-length figures of Thomas and Dorothy face each other, while kneeling over a prayer desk (which is inscribed with a Latin memorial). Beneath these figures are two panels, with kneeling figures of their children in miniature: three sons under Thomas and seven daughters under Dorothy.

Rickard, 572 U.S. 765 (2014), is a United States Supreme Court case involving the use of force by police officers during high-speed car chases. After first holding that it had jurisdiction to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. Near midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase ending in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car as he continued to flee. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for summary judgment, arguing they were entitled to qualified immunity because their actions did not violate law that was clearly established at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed. On May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9‚Äì0) decision authored by Justice Samuel Alito, the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \\"grave public safety risk\\" and that the officers \\"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \\"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.  Background  = Prior case law = The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by the federal government, and the Fourteenth Amendment extends this prohibition to state governments under the incorporation doctrine. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The use of force by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as Tennessee v. Garner (1985) and Graham v. Connor (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \\"objectively reasonable\\" in light of the circumstances confronting them. Prior to Plumhoff the Supreme Court had also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically. In Brosseau v. Haugen (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the use of force by a police officer who fired her gun into the back of a suspect's car after chasing the suspect on foot. The Court held in Scott v. Harris (2007) that a \\"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\\"Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007), slip op. at 13 (U.S. April 30, 2007). In both cases, the Court confirmed that the standard of review for force against fleeing motorists is the same \\"objective reasonableness\\" standard as that in Graham v. Connor. If a person believes that the use of force against them is unjustified, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß1983 allows them to file a civil action, claiming a violation of their constitutional rights. In general, police officers are protected from individual liability from these claims by the qualified immunity doctrine, which prevents government officials, including police officers, from being held individually liable for federal civil rights violations unless their conduct violated clearly established law at the time in question. In Johnson v. Jones (1995), the Supreme Court held that a defendant entitled to qualified immunity in these kinds of cases cannot immediately appeal a district court's order regarding a motion for summary judgment \\"insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial\\".Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995). = Facts of the case = Around midnight on July 18, 2004, Lieutenant Joseph Forthman of the West Memphis, Arkansas, Police Department pulled over a white Honda Accord driven by Donald Rickard because the car had only one working headlight. A woman named Kelly Allen sat in the car's passenger seat. During the traffic stop, the lieutenant noticed an indentation in the car's windshield that, according to him, was \\"'roughly the size of a head or basketball'\\". He then saw beer in the car and asked whether Rickard had been drinking, which Rickard denied. Rickard appeared nervous and failed to produce a driver's license when asked; the lieutenant asked him to step out of the car, but Rickard sped away. The lieutenant, later joined by other officers, pursued Rickard in a high-speed car chase down Interstate 40 that reached speeds beyond per hour.Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 2. The chase lasted approximately five minutes. According to a video of the car chase, Rickard nearly struck 29 other drivers, struck two different patrol cars, and nearly struck another patrol car. Rickard drove east, crossing the Mississippi River into Tennessee. The officers attempted unsuccessfully to use a \\"rolling roadblock\\" to stop Rickard. After exiting Interstate 40, Rickard collided with the cruiser of one of the officers and spun out into a parking lot in Memphis, Tennessee. Rickard temporarily stopped next to a building, and officers approached his car on foot. Rickard then began to back up, and an officer pounded against his passenger-side window with his firearm. Rickard subsequently collided with another police cruiser, and even though Rickard's bumper was flush against the cruiser, he continued to use his accelerator. At this point, Sergeant Vance Plumhoff fired three shots into Rickard's car. Then, as Rickard continued \\"fleeing down\\" a street, officers Troy Galtelli and John Gardner fired twelve additional shots in the direction of Rickard's car, making the total number of shots fired in the incident fifteen. Rickard then lost control and crashed into a building. He and Allen died from a combination of gunshot wounds and crash injuries.Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 3. = Lower court proceedings = Whitne Rickard, Rickard's minor daughter, filed a legal action under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 against Plumhoff and the other officers, alleging that the officers had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by using excessive force against her father. The officers filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee denied this motion on January 20, 2011, holding that the officers' conduct violated clearly established law at the time of the incident.Estate of Allen v. City of West Memphis, Nos. 05-2489/2585, 2011 WL 197426 (W.D. Tenn. Jan. 20, 2011). Before the case could proceed, the officers appealed the district court's denial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson v. Jones, but later vacated that judgment and instead affirmed the District Court's holding on October 9, 2012.Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 4.Estate of Allen v. City of West Memphis, 509 F. App'x 388, 389 (6th Cir. 2012)  Supreme Court  Justice Samuel Alito wrote the unanimous opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in Plumhoff v. Rickard The officers filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. The petition was distributed for conference six times before the Court granted certiorari on November 15, 2013. Two questions were presented in the petition: (1) \\"whether the Sixth Circuit wrongly denied qualified immunity to Petitioners by analyzing whether the force used in 2004 was distinguishable from factually similar force ruled permissible three years later in Scott v. Harris [...]\\", and (2) \\"whether the Sixth Circuit erred in denying qualified immunity by finding the use of force was not reasonable as a matter of law when, under Respondent's own facts, the suspect led police officers on a high-speed pursuit [...]\\". = Opinion of the Court = Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court on May 27, 2014. Writing for a unanimous Court, Alito first addressed whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear the case as an interlocutory appeal. Alito then wrote that the officers' conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Finally, Alito stated that the officers would still be entitled to qualified immunity even if their actions had violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court reversed the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 15.  Jurisdiction  In general, federal law (specifically ) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \\"final decisions\\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \\"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of ¬ß1291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 5. However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \\"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\\". Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in Johnson v. Jones prevents the Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in Johnson, the summary judgment order was not appealable because \\"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', i.e. which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 6. In the case of Plumhoff v. Rickard, however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \\"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 6‚Äì7.  Fourth Amendment  Moving to his constitutional analysis of the case, Alito explained that he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers violated \\"clearly established law\\" by answering whether the officers actually violated the Fourth Amendment, citing the Court's decision in Saucier v. Katz (2001).Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 7. Alito reaffirmed the Court's decisions in Graham v. Connor and Tennessee v. Garner that excessive force claims against law enforcement officers are evaluated under the \\"objective reasonableness\\" standard of the Fourth Amendment, which \\"requires analyzing the totality of the circumstances\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 8. Examining the facts of the case \\"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment, stating: > Under the circumstances at the moment when the shots were fired, all that a > reasonable police officer could have concluded was that Rickard was intent > on resuming his flight and that, if he was allowed to do so, he would once > again pose a deadly threat for others on the road.Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, > slip op. at 8‚Äì10. Alito wrote there was \\"no basis for reaching a different conclusion\\" from the Court's decision in Scott v. Harris, stating that \\"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\\" and that \\"the police acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 10‚Äì11. Furthermore, Alito stated that the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was also reasonable, writing that \\"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 11. In Rickard's case, Alito stated that \\"during the 10-second span when all the shots were fired, Rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee\\" and that the case would be different \\"if petitioners had initiated a second round of shots after an initial round had clearly incapacitated Rickard and had ended any threat of continued flight, or if Rickard had clearly given himself up\\". The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \\"whether petitioners violated Rickard's Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen's\\".  Qualified immunity  Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \\"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 12. Alito reiterated that an official is \\"entitled to qualified immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was '\\"clearly established\\"' at the time of the challenged conduct\\". Citing the Court's decision in Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (2011), Alito stated that a defendant in a qualified immunity case is said to have violated a \\"clearly established right\\" only when \\"the right's contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in the defendant's shoes would have understood that he was violating it\\". In the case of Plumhoff, Alito wrote that the Court's decision in Brosseau v. Haugen, in which the Court found reasonable the conduct of a police officer who fired shots at a fleeing vehicle, \\"squarely demonstrates that no clearly established law precluded petitioners' conduct at the time in question\\".Plumhoff, 572 U.S. 765, slip op. at 13.  Analysis and reception  = Legal implications = In a legal analysis published in Criminal Justice Review, a peer-reviewed academic journal published by SAGE Publishing, Darrell L. Ross of Valdosta State University discussed the legal and practical implications of Plumhoff. According to Ross, \\"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\\". Specifically, the \\"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court‚Äîwhich was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit‚Äîis whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\\" During the course of the Court's review of the case, the justices watched audiovisual recordings of the car chase that led to Rickard's death. In an analysis published in the Fordham Law Review, Denise K. Barry compared Plumhoff to the case Tolan v. Cotton (2014), in which the Supreme Court summarily vacated a motion which granted summary judgment to a police officer on the basis of qualified immunity. In Tolan, no audio-visual evidence was available for the Court to review. In comparing the cases, Barry argued that \\"the Court decided Tolan and Plumhoff as it did because in Tolan, the evidence was purely testimonial, while in Plumhoff, an audiovisual record was available to the Court\\". In her analysis, Barry proposed that judges \\"must undergo further education regarding the near impossibility of experiencing audiovisual evidence objectively\\", concluding that rather than judges, \\"more often than not, a jury should view the audiovisual evidence, bringing to this purported objective evidence a variety of viewpoints and perspectives\\". = Effect on law enforcement = In his analysis of Plumhoff, Ross also commented that police are reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with Graham, especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \\"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\\" Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired: police officers \\"are not trained or required to shoot to wound\\", he wrote, \\"nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force\\". According to Ross, \\"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped\\". Finally, Ross wrote, \\"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\\" Ross recommended that \\"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from Rickard, Graham, Scott, and Brosseau\\". In an article published in the UC Davis Law Review, Sharon R. Fairley, a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, wrote that \\"law enforcement experts and agencies generally agree that firing at or into moving vehicles is an unsound police tactic\\", arguing that \\"the Court should reconsider its opinion [in Plumhoff] that using deadly force is almost always a more effective way to end a vehicle pursuit than merely abandoning the pursuit\\". In the Michigan Journal of Race & Law, Jonathan M. Smith of the David A. Clarke School of Law wrote, \\"While the Plumhoff Court emphasized the dangerousness of a high-speed chase, it ignored the fact that the chase would cease as soon as the police stopped chasing the suspect.\\" Given the danger posed by high-speed chases, Smith commented that \\"the National Institute of Justice issued recommendations in 1990 to limit the use of high-speed chases and to pursue alternatives, including ceasing the pursuit and tracking down the car at a later time through its license plate number\\". In an article published in the Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Review, John P. Gross, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, discussed Plumhoff in the context of multiple cases related to qualified immunity and commented that they \\"give little guidance to law enforcement agencies attempting to develop use of force policies\\". Gross compared Plumhoff to the 2015 case Mullenix v. Luna, describing both as \\"especially problematic\\" because both \\"approved of shooting into a car in an effort to stop a fleeing suspect despite the fact that the vast majority of law enforcement agencies instruct officers to never fire into a moving car\\". = Reactions and criticism = Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law, wrote an opinion piece published in The New York Times, in which he described the Court's decision as \\"deeply disturbing\\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at fleeing vehicles, such as \\"shooting out the car‚Äôs tires\\" or \\"taking the license plate number and tracking the driver down later\\". In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights. In a blog post published in The Hill, Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at Emory University School of Law, argued that the Court's decision in Plumhoff was inconsistent with the precedent it set in Scott, commenting that the Court \\"jettisoned Scott's careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\\". Nash stated there were differences between the facts in Plumhoff versus the facts in Scott, which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion. For example, in Scott, the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in Plumhoff, the police used their firearms. Additionally, in Scott, the driver was the only one in the fleeing car, whereas in Plumhoff, Rickard had a passenger. In a post published in the blog Crimes and Consequences, Kent Scheidegger commented that in light of Scott, \\"it is clear enough that there was no Fourth Amendment violation on the straight merits of the case, and it is virtually beyond dispute that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity\\". On that basis, Scheidegger speculated that the reason Plumhoff was distributed for conference numerous times was because the Court was considering reversing the Sixth Circuit as a summary disposition.

Posted - Jul 22nd, 2019 @ 9:00pm He was also instrumental in the acquisition of a number of significant properties for the LDS Church, including the Hill Cumorah. Biography Willard Washington Bean was born on May 16, 1868, the seventh of ten children, to George Washington Bean and Elizabeth n√©e Baum. In 1875, when he was about seven years old, his family moved to Sevier County, Utah. They lived on the west side of the Sevier River, about three miles east of the village of Richfield. Vicki Bean Topliff, Rand H. Packer. Early Years. From 1894 to 1895 he studied at Brigham Young University. He then went on to be a Physical Education Instructor at the University of Utah for two years. He also served as a member of both the Salt Lake City and Richfield police departments, and edited the Richfield Reaper. Bean married Gussie Dee n√©e Felts in the Manti Utah Temple on May 3, 1899, and they had two children. They divorced in August 1908. On 18 September 1914, he married Rebecca Rosetta Peterson, with whom he had another four children.  Boxing record  He had his boxing debut on September 4, 1897, losing on a points decision. His career lasted for 18 fights, with a record of eight wins, three draws, and seven losses. However these are only the recorded fights, it is likely that Bean fought in additional contests that haven't been acknowledged. In 1905, Bean claimed the title of middleweight champion of the world. Although it was not until 1910 with the formation of the International Boxing Union that world title fights were created, until that time champions were generally recognized by public acclamation. The World Middleweight boxing champion at the time was Tommy Ryan.  Missionary work  In 1907 the LDS Church purchased the farmhouse and surrounding land in Palmyra, New York, that was originally owned by Joseph Smith Sr. In 1915 Bean was sent as a missionary to live at the farm, the first members of the church to live in Palmyra for eighty-four years. He was instrumental in acquiring additional properties of historical significance to the church, including the Hill Cumorah. Through his and his family's work three branches of the Church were subsequently established in the area. They were released from their mission in 1939, and returned to Salt Lake City, where Bean died on September 25, 1949.  In the media and popular culture  The Fighting Preacher is a 2019 drama film depicting the 24-year missionary service of Willard and Rebecca Bean in Palmyra, New York.

Early life Heather George was born on 29 April 1907 in Gordon, New South Wales to father Wesley, a builder, and mother Helen. She attended public primary schools and then a boarding school in the Blue Mountains which was a better climate for her asthma. After secondary education she went to East Sydney Technical College to study art and commercial art amongst fellow students including Dahl Collings, Elaine Haxton, Joshua Smith, taught by sculptor Rayner Hoff, and later continued her studies in British-born James S. Watkins' private Sydney art school in order to concentrate on drawing. On leaving Technical College in 1927 George went to live with her family in Canberra after its official opening, where here father and his partner had built a number of early Canberra buildings. There, she taught art at St Gabriel's Church of England Grammar School and arts and crafts at the Y.W.C.A. She joined the Artists' Society of Canberra and was the first woman to be on the council. On return to Sydney some years later George practised as a commercial artist designing in the then-emerging field of neon signs for businesses and theatres. After a break from study of some years Heather again took up training in painting with fellow students Helen Lempriere, Matcham Skipper, Lesley Sinclair and Madeleine Jorgensen under the tonalist artist Justus Jorgenson in Melbourne, where she worked in textile design at Vida Turner's firm at 191 Queen Street. Photographer By 1938, at the age of 31, she had taken up photography professionally and worked at the Noel Rubie‚Äôs (1901‚Äì1976) portrait and industrial photography studio in Sydney. A wistful portrait of George taken by Rubie, who was an actor and artist as well as a photographer, appears full-page in a 1938 issue of The Home : an Australian quarterlyThe Home : an Australian quarterly. Vol. 19 No. 7 (1 July 1938) Sydney : Art in Australia, 1920-1942 over the caption \\"Miss Heather George, of Artarmon, is a youthful Sydney artist who has lately abandoned painting for photography\\". She later practiced at a series of Melbourne and Victorian country photography studios. By the late 1950s George had become a freelance photographer and photojournalist, photographing Sydney‚Äôs older suburbs, and stately homes in Hunters Hill She moved to Victoria and recorded the nineteenth-century slate-tiled warehouses of the St James Buildings, the demolition of the Eastern Markets and the construction of the King Street Bridge, the watch-tower of Melbourne‚Äôs fire station, and mud-brick buildings in Eltham. In 1952 George stayed for months in the outback of the Northern Territory, where her sister and her sister's husband were stationed at several reservations, and there photographed indigenous subjects for whom she developed great respect and love, including the Warlpiri people whom she described as among Australia's \\"most hardy and interesting aborigines\\", and others on the reserves, including school children at Areyonga Aboriginal Reserve, or working in cattle stations including Wave Hill. George shared her time between Melbourne and Sydney, and after 24 years based in Melbourne, settled in Paddington in the sixties, the suburb in which her grandfather Tom George was for many years an alderman and at one time Mayor. She continued to be a regular contributor of photographs for Walkabout, and many articles of the 60s feature her pictures of that suburb, of Woolloomooloo, Castlecrag, and of other features of Sydney, including Taronga Park Zoo, the Butler Stairs of Kings Cross, the multi-storied Chevron-Hilton hotel at Potts Point under construction, the emerging street caf√©s Macquarie Street, and the Mitchell Library. She travelled to Hobart for pictures of the Cat and Fiddle Square Her work also appeared in Hoofs and Horns, Pix, Women's Day, as well as the National Trust Magazine.

The line operates every 25‚Äì38 minutes during peak hours, 60 minutes during weekday off peak hours, and 58‚Äì62 minutes on the weekends. Trips roughly take 50‚Äì60 minutes. History The Chillum Road Line initially started off as a streetcar line in the 1940s and simply consisted of the F3 Line, which operated between the Historic Mount Rainier streetcar terminal at the intersection of 34th Street & Rhode Island Avenue and intersection of Eastern Avenue NW & Laurel Avenue in Takoma Park, MD, and Eastern Avenue NW mostly operating via Rhode Island Avenue, Eastern Avenue NE, Queens Chapel Road, and Chillum Road. The F2 line operated as a completely different streetcar line between Mount Rainier terminal and Farragut Square in Downtown D.C. Both streetcar lines were later converted into bus routes in the 1950s and ultimately converted into Metrobus Routes on February 4, 1973 when WMATA acquired four failing private bus companies across the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area, and merged them together to form its own system. =Service Changes= 1978 Changes On February 19, 1978 when Takoma station opened, route F3 was rerouted to terminate at the newly opened station, instead of terminating at Eastern Avenue NW & Laurel Avenue in Takoma Park, MD creating the ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤‚Ä≤Chillum Road Line‚Ä≤‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. Route F2 also joined the Chillum Road Line, and was rerouted to operate alongside F3 between the intersection of 34th Street & Rhode Island Avenue in Mount Rainier, MD & Takoma station, instead of operating all the way up to Farragut Square. The only difference would be that routes F2 & F3 would operate separately on their same exact streetcar routing between the intersection of 34th Street & Rhode Island Avenue & the intersection of Arundel Road & Russell Avenue in Mount Rainier while F2 would remain straight on 34th Street past the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue, then make a turn onto the intersection of Rainier Avenue, then make another turn onto the intersection of Upshur Street, and another turn onto the intersection of 28th Place, another turn onto the intersection of Russell Avenue to reach the intersection of Arundel Road but would make a right turn onto the intersection of Arundel Road, instead of making a turn onto Arundel Road. Route F3 would make a turn from 34th Street onto the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue, then make a turn onto the intersection of Eastern Avenue NE, and then another turn onto Varnum Street, which turns into Arundel Road after a block north. Route F3 completely took over the segment of F2's routing along Varnum Street and Arundel Road between the intersections of Eastern Avenue & Russell Avenue, which was discontinued. At the intersection of Arundel Road & Russell Avenue, both F2 & F3 would rejoin each other and operate parallel to each other on the exact same routing to Takoma. On December 3, 1978 shortly after Cheverly station opened, routes F2 and F3 were extended from the Mount Rainier terminus to operate to Cheverly, while F3 was further extended to operate to Columbia Park (East Marlboro Avenue & East Spring Street) replacing parts of the former streetcar line route 88's routing between the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue & Eastern Avenue NE in Mount Rainier and the intersection of Cheverly Avenue & Columbia Park Road, in Cheverly, MD, when route 88 was discontinued. Route F2 was also rerouted to make a turn onto the intersection of Eastern Avenue NE, and another turn to get back onto the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue while route F3 was rerouted to make a turn from the intersection of Eastern Avenue onto the intersection of Rhode Island Avenue and no longer operate between the intersections of Rhode Island Avenue & 34th Street. Both routes would then operate parallel to each other between Rhode Island Avenue and Cheverly, following route 88's former routing via Rhode Island Avenue, 38th Street/38th Avenue, Bladensburg Road, Annapolis Road, Landover Road, Prince George's Hospital, Landover Road, Cheverly Avenue, and Columbia Park Road. Route F3 would then operate further east of Cheverly to its terminus at the intersection of East Marlboro Avenue & East Spring Street in the Columbia Park subdivision of Landover, via Columbia Park Road, Kent Village Drive, Flagstaff Street, and East Marlboro Avenue. 1993 Changes On December 11, 1993, route F3 was discontinued and renamed, \\"Route F1\\", while F2 kept its route number the same. Route F1 was truncated to only operate between Takoma & Cheverly, similar to Route F2. The segment of Route F3 former routing between the Cheverly & Columbia Park, was replaced by new route F12, which was extended from Landover to Cheverly. Routes F1 and F2 were rerouted to operate between Cheverly station & Prince George's Hospital, by serving Prince George's Hospital from the inside, instead of operating on Cheverly Avenue between the intersections of Columbia Park Road & Landover Road, and entering Prince George's Hospital from the intersection of Landover Road. Both routes would still exit the Prince George's Hospital when operating westbound towards Takoma station and still enter Prince George's Hospital from Landover Road when operating eastbound towards Cheverly. Route F2 former routing on Cheverly Avenue between the intersections of Columbia Park Road & Landover Road, was replaced by the extended route F13 from New Carrollton to Cheverly, and provide weekday service between Cheverly & Washington Business Park, and also fully taken over by route F8. In addition to the change, both routes went through minor rerouting change to serve West Hyattsville by deviating onto Queens Chapel Road before turning onto 25th Ave heading to Cheverly or straight towards Takoma.

Her research considers stress-activated kinases and the development of diseases associated with obesity. She was awarded the Princess of Girona Foundation Scientist Prize in 2012 and selected as one of the Top 100 Women Leaders in Spain in 2017.  Early life and education  Sabio was born in Badajoz in 1977. She attended the Colegio del Santo √Ångel and the Institute of San Fernando. She studied veterinary sciences at the University of Extremadura, and graduated in 2000 with an extraordinary award. She has said that she chose to study veterinary science as she liked animals very much, and that this could help her understand the origins of diseases. She moved to the United Kingdom for her doctoral studies, where she joined the University of Dundee as an Medical Research Council European graduate student. She completed her doctorate on p38 delta kinases in 2005. Whilst her PhD had taught her how to research in vitro, Sabio was keen to translate her research into mouse models. She joined the research group of Roger Davis at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute where she studied the impact of stress on kinases proteins. In 2009 she was awarded Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal funding to join a biotechnology laboratory in Spain.  Research and career  Sabio joined the Spanish National Cardiovascular Research Centre in 2011. Sabio is investigating the molecular mechanisms that are associated with obesity, and how they can predispose patients to other conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of liver carcinoma, and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Whilst there is chemotherapy available, it can only increase a patient's life by three months. Sabio researches p38gamma, a kinase protein that is expressed excessively in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and whether inhibition of this protein could reduce the cancer. She is developing drugs that inhibit p38gamma for the treatment of liver cancer. She has also investigated the C-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) protein, which is known to control obesity. She believes that obesity will be a major challenge for future generations, and it should be taken as seriously as smoking. By considering fat, adipose tissue, as an endocrine organ she believes people will think more carefully about how to care for it. She believes that the best antidotes to obesity are exercise and diet. In 2017 Sabio was inducted into the European Molecular Biology Organization.

The Pyongyang Defence Command (), also known as the Pyongyang Defense Corps is a military area and corps of the Korean People's Army based out of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang. The PDC is composed of 70,000 KPA personnel who, alongside the Supreme Guard Command and the III Corps, are responsible for the defense of the capital. According to North Korea analyst Joseph F. Bermudez, the command operates, unlike its two counterparts, inside the Pyongyang area.Bermudez, Shield of the Great Leader, Allen and Unwin, 2001, 58, 64. It reports directly to the General Staff Department and is considered to be one of the many levers of power in the KPA. History The command was established under the Ministry of National Defence (now the Ministry of People's Armed Forces) in 1955 with the aim of defending the national capital from the South Korean Army and the Eighth United States Army following the UN offensive into North Korea. It was incorporated into the KPA order of precedence command in the 1960s and became independent 30 years later in the 1990s. In the 1980s, it reported to Unit 963, but was later removed from its order of battle. The 2014 Defense White Paper, published by the ministry on 21 December 2012, said the Pyongyang Defense Command subordinated artillery units were transferred to the General Staff Department of the KPA to unify the artillery command system. A notable commander of the command was Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, who commanded it from 2003 to 2009 and later became the KPA Chief of the General Staff. He was the last person known to have commanded the PDC. Another notable commander was Pak Ki So who was the predecessor to Ri who served from 1995 to 2003. Duties It is primarily responsible for the protection of the capital and its state and party assets. The command utilizes the Youth Hero Motorway as a military route for the southern DPRK alongside the III Army Corps. During a potential Coup d'√©tat or a foreign invasion, tank divisions are deployed to the highway to cut off access to the capital. The airspace of the capital is defended by the Pyongyang Air Defense Command of the Korean People's Army Air and Anti-Air Force. The commanding officer of the command is usually a billet of Colonel general and is traditionally in charge of all ceremonial military parades on Kim Il Sung Square.

Life and career Patron was born in Vannes in 1997, and raised in Saint-Av√©. His father was a driving instructor and his mother a childminder. He played football for his hometown club, Vannes OC from age 10 to 15, before spending the next four years with Brest. During that time, he passed his baccalaur√©at and began a college course in sports studies. As a 17-year-old, he played in the senior squad that won the 2015 Coupe de Bretagne Senior, and the following season, he made one appearance in the fifth-tier Championnat de France Amateur 2 (CFA2) and was part of the under-19 squad that reached the semi-final of that season's Coupe Gambardella, in which they lost to a Monaco under-19 side featuring the already first-team regular Kylian Mbapp√©. He was however second-choice goalkeeper behind Gautier Larsonneur at under-19 level, and was released in 2016. After trials with Lorient, Angers and Clermont, Patron signed for the latter as fourth-choice goalkeeper, with the prospect of moving up the pecking order if he had a good season with the B-team in the CFA2. He played 19 matches, and in his second season trained regularly with the professional group while playing 20 matches in the 2017‚Äì18 Championnat National 3 (successor to the CFA2). In August 2019, he was one of several younger players selected to start the Coupe de la Ligue first round match against third-tier Laval, which Clermont won 3‚Äì0. He was named as substitute goalkeeper for the Ligue 2 team on 12 occasions that season, but never took the field. He signed for Le Mans, newly promoted to Ligue 2, in June 2019. Initially third choice goalkeeper, a dislocated finger for Yoann Thuram gave Patron a seat on the bench, and when J√©r√©my Aymes was injured while making a clearance 11 minutes into the Coupe de la Ligue round of 32 match against Nice on 30 October, Patron made an unexpected first-team debut.

Biography At the age of 13 years, Vlardimir Kozlovsky entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he studied with Konstantin Korovin and Isaac Levitan.. His professional development was heavily influenced by his friends as well as his teachers, Alexei Savrasov, Vasily Polenov and Vasily Perov. After graduation in 1887, Vladimir went back to Kiev and was soon accepted by the Kiev Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts (1890 - 1896). Kozlovsky's early paintings won multiple awards in Kiev and Moscow during these years, including \\"Quiet Monastery\\" (1892), \\"Sweet home\\" (1893), \\"Noon\\" (1894) and \\"Pine Forest\\" (1895). By the beginning of the XX century, Kozlovsky became one of the Russian impressionists, joining the growing art movement in the country. In his paintings, Vladimir connected the landscape painting traditions of his teacher, Vasily Polenov, with genre scenes of Vasily Perov, vividly describing simple life of Ukrainian peasants. In 1915, Vladimir Kozlovsky was a founding member of the Kiev Society of Artists (1914-1919) and served as Secretary of this society for 5 years. His paintings were exhibited throughout the Russian Empire, including Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kiev, Odessa, Kharkov, Zhytomyr and other cities. Several of his most famous pieces, such as \\"Winter\\", \\"Printemps\\", \\"Road to Zhytomyr\\", \\"Pond\\", \\"At the river\\", \\"Fishermen\\" were published as postcards. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, many painters had to leave the country. The new communist ideology was particularly hostile to the \\"bourgeois\\" impressionist art movement, deemed to be incompatible with the communist values. Vladimir Kozlovsky remained in Kiev and started working as an illustrator of children's books, cooperating with the same publishing houses that earlier were publishing his paintings.

Alice Davies joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to protest for women's right to vote. Davies became the Liverpool WPSU Branch organiser from June 1910 to September 2012, trying to move the approach of the four branches in the area to holding more large indoor events and social functions, away from the frequent street meetings outside factories and smaller 'At Homes' in more affluent areas that were a feature before her. The groups in the Cheshire side of the Mersey continued the street events with speakers from Liverpool and beyond, and from November 1910 WSPU had toned down its militancy for a period. The branch shop did not do well during that time with a drop from over ¬£18 annual profit from written material sales to just over19shillings (less than ¬£1) as it became a more exclusive 'members meeting' place. As most of the suffragette literature had been sold at street meetings to spread the message about 'votes for women' to the public, the change in management may reflect lost opportunities to increase support for the cause. Davies organised Holiday Campaigns' in the Lake District, and used Vida Goldstein and Beatrice Harraden, from the national movement to support this. In 1911, Davies was writing to encourage local members to join a deputation to London to attempt to speak to Prime Minister Lloyd-George on 21 November. During 2012, Davies was one of the two hundred women arrested during a protest which took place on 1 and 4 March 1912, which was a second wave of window smashing protests in the wealthy London shopping area, the West End, in Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea. This took place at the same time as the Parliament was debating a Conciliation Bill (which was to have given some women the right to vote but was not passed). Davies said at her trial that 'women were determined to fight for the same human rights enjoyed by men. They were tired of being treated as aliens & would continue their struggle until they had reached their objective.' Davies's sentence was three months and she went on hunger strike. Whilst she was away the Liverpool WSPU continued and members praised Patricia Woodlock as a public speaker, the temporary branch organiser. In recognition of Davies suffering in prison, the WSPU awarded her a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' designed by Christabel Pankhurst, with the ribbon in the colours of the movement - green, white and purple, representing 'hope, purity and dignity' and dated 4 March 1912. The presentation box was inscribed > ALICE DAVIES - BY THE WOMEN'S SOCIAL & POLITICAL UNION IN RECOGNITION OF A > GALLANT ACTION, WHEREBY THROUGH ENDURANCE TO THE LAST EXTREMITY OF HUNGER > AND HARDSHIP, A GREAT PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL JUSTICE WAS VINDICATED. National Archive record lists those who were imprisoned and later subject to the pardon granted to all suffragettes when the WSPU discontinued militancy at the start of World War One; she was listed there as Alice 'Davis', but the record states it was created from later recollections of suffragette activists and not from original prison or court documents. political poster against force-feeding hunger strike women Women imprisoned who went on hunger strike were frequently force-fed and despite not being treated as 'political prisoners' were supportive of each other, in whatever way they could. One example of this that Davies took part in Holloway Prison, was the creation by sixty-eight women of what became known as The Suffragette Handkerchief: secretly embroidering their name, initials or full signature on a common piece of cloth, right under the eyes of the prison wardresses (probably in the exercise yard), and smuggled out by Mary Ann Hilliard and now in The Priest House Museum, West Hoathly on display there and with similar items it can also be viewed online. On return to Liverpool, Davies may have been hesitant for the abilities of her team so organised a campaign meeting at the Sun Hall, Liverpool jointly with two other organisations (NUWSS and the Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association (CUWFA), for the first time, as well as building relations with the local Men's League for Women's Suffrage and the newly developing Church League, but the publicity focussed on the CUWFA role. Davies also organised a visit by Emmeline Pankhurst to the Hardman Hall, which was written up in Votes for Women, February 2012. Dr. Alice Ker spoke warmly of Davies, during their time in Holloway together, and Davies gave her an appropriate low key release 'welcome' and garden party, rather than the big public events for the release of Patricia Woodlock and others. It appears that Davies moved away from the area after the next summer campaign in the Lake District.  Later life  Davies became a Nursing Sister at Westminster, and served in the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (during World War One) but does not seem to appear in later key records of the suffragette or the women's rights movements. She wrote to her nephew Frederick Lesley Stuart Davies, a private in the Army Cyclist Corps. King's Liverpool Regiment and Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, who was discharged injured in 1919. Davies's date of death is unknown.

Wimbush (January 1854 ‚Äì 15 March 1914) was an English landscape and portrait painter. Born in London, England, Wimbush first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1889 and went on to mount several other exhibitions there over the years. The spelling Wimbush is not found in his birth record. It is believed that letter 'L' did not stand for anything. It was just an initial. He died at Totnes ‚Äì an artistic area in Devon on the South Coast ‚Äì age 60 on 15 March 1914. Bishopsgate and Warwick John L. Wimbush's father was Edward John Winbush, Licensed Victualler (from 1856) of the Magpie and Punchbowl hotel, Bishopsgate. From records at the General Register Office, a 'John Winbush' was born in London in January 1854 probably at the hotel. He was baptised in the family church, St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate, on 12 February 1854. John was the second born and the second son of a family of 11. He ultimately had 5 brothers and 4 sisters. The building 100 Bishopsgate now stands on the original site of the Magpie and Punchbowl. On the 1871 census Winbush was registered as living at 58 Bishopgate Street London. He was listed as an 'Artist student'. At this time he was 17 years of age. On the census document his name was given as John Winbush. Old Fourpenny Shop hotel, Warwick His grandfather John Wimbush (also spelt Winbush and born circa 1791), was the Licensed Victualler (from 1849) of the Old Fourpenny Shop hotel, Warwick. John L. Wimbush possibly spent some time living with his Wimbush grandfather in Warwick. In both 1891 census and the 1901 census he had registered as being born in Warwick. In those days, there were many alternative spellings for family names. As all the Winbush children were well educated, it appears that there was a definite decision on his part to change the spelling of his name. As there was another artist, Henry B Wimbush, John Wimbush may have wanted to differentiate the two Wimbush names and added the 'L.' From then on he went by the name John L. Wimbush. However, in his final years (for the 1911 census in Devon) he used the name, John Lewis Winbush. John Wimbush developed as an artist and around 1874 had his own studio. Initially he may have shared the studio with other artists. Fitzroy Street Initially Wimbush was based in London. He became a friend of the American painter, James McNeill Whistler. Whistler lived for a time at No. 8 Fitzroy Square in Camden Town. John Wimbush's career as an artist was centred around this same area for the last part of the 19th century. Wimbush moved in artist circles and his path would have crossed with many other major artists of the day. There was a vibrant community of artists around Fitzroy Square and Fitzroy Street. He was friends with the artist Albert Ludovici. One of Wimbush's friends was Walter Sickert. Sickert took up painting in 1881. He then became a pupil and etching assistant to James Whistler. Although Sickert was 8 years younger than John they may have been fellow students. Sickert later became a prominent art teacher and the subject of the book, Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper‚ÄîCase Closed. An opium den at Lime Street ‚Äì titled in 1889 as ‚Äì Lingering Clouds A painting by Wimbush, An opium den At Lime Street was painted in 1889. It is the only painting known that includes an address. The Lime Street referred to is in the district of Limehouse. Lime Street is less than 1 kilometre from Bishopsgate. Limehouse and Lime Street sometimes mistakenly thought to be derived from the nickname for the seamen that disembarked there, who had earned the name Lime‚Äîjuicers or limeys after the obligatory ration of lime juice the Royal Navy gave their sailors to ward off scurvy. The area achieved notoriety for opium dens in the late 19th century, often featured in pulp fiction works by Sax Rohmer and others. The name Limehouse, originally spelt Lymehouse, actually goes back to the 1300s and referred to the lime kilns that were once there. Wimbush exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1889, 1899, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904. The painting An opium den At Lime Street was exhibited (as work 1772) in 1889, then titled Lingering Clouds. The Mutualart website notes: > John L. Wimbush is a 19th Century painter. John L.

Lucien Freud was the grandson of Sigmund Freud and was himself a well known British artist specialising in figurative art. Marianne Faithfull, was the girlfriend of Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones. A letter from James McNeill Whistler refers to John Wimbush. In the letter to a Mrs Pennell, dated 28 November 1897, Whistler closes with: > I wish you would send for Ludovici ‚Äì and read him my letters, that he may > know, for I am fond of him, and he will then be ready to meet Sickert when > he comes upon him in the little restaurant in Charlotte Street. He might ask > Walter if he is writing a pleasing article for the Baronet on the trial. > Ludovici must tell Wimbush. Take care of this letter ‚Äì we may require it. 'Ludovici must tell Wimbush' was written in the right-hand margin at right angles to the main text. Charlotte Street starts just a couple of houses from 8 Fitzroy Street and is a continuation of Fitzroy Street. The painting Waiting for a Bite is signed J. L. Wimbush/1901 (lower left) and signed ‚ÄòRoyal Academy Exhibition/No 2/J. L. Wimbush/8 Fitzroy Street/Fitzroy Square/Waiting a Bite‚Äô (on the artist‚Äôs label, attached to the reverse). This gives us an address for John Wimbush as 8 Fitzroy Street but also Fitzroy Square. There is a bit of confusion here as 8 Fitzroy Street is a few doors away from Fitzroy Square. 8 Fitzroy Square is a separate place. 8 Fitzroy Square is where Whistler lived for a time. This painting, Waiting for a Bite, has been made into a jigsaw. It is known that Whistler used Wimbush's studio at Fitzroy Street for photography late in the 1890s. He brought in some photographers to take pictures of his paintings. > As the light was not good for the photographer, some canvasses were moved > out in the hall, some were put on the roof, but the best place was > discovered to be Mr. Wimbush‚Äôs studio on the same building. In 1901 Wimbush's studio was in Fitzroy Street. This and Fitzroy Square is the address for Wimbush's studio while he was in London in the 1890s and early 1900s. James Whistler died in 1903. For a time early in the 1900s, after Wimbush left for Dartmouth in Devon, 8 Fitzroy Street became Walter Sickert's studio. In 1907 Sickert formed the Fitzroy Street Group, an organisation created to support artists. This group first met at 8 Fitzroy Street before moving to 19 Fitzroy Street. In 1917 Sickert painted Entrance to 8 Fitzroy Street, Whistler's Studio. Although, Sickert's painting refers to 'Whistler's Studio' it may have been Wimbush's studio that Whistler was using at the time. From the 1800s and into the early 1900s Fitzroy Street developed a reputation as a Bohemian area. Numerous people of note lived in the vicinity. The artists, writers and intellectuals who lived and worked in the area in the late 19th and early 20th century included Clive Bell, Ford Madox Brown, Quentin Crisp, Thomas Musgrave Joy, John Maynard Keynes, Karl Marx, George Orwell, Lytton Strachey, Dylan Thomas, Arthur Rimbaud, George Bernard Shaw, and Virginia Woolf. Lord Salisbury served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times over 13 years starting in 1885. His home was at 21 Fitzroy Square. Dartmouth Untitled drawing by John L. Wimbush ‚Äì at St Gennys, Crackington Haven, North Cornwell, UK According to Whistler's web-site John Wimbush moved to Dartmouth around 1902. Why he moved to Dartmouth and where exactly his studio and residence was is in that location is also unknown. Interestingly the painter Henry B. Wimbush also did numerous illustrations and drawings around Devon and Cornwall at this time and possibly the website devoted to Whistler above confuses the two. Henry B. Wimbush was a book illustrator and postcard artist. In Dartmouth, he painted the mayor, Charles Peek. This painting is currently held at the Dartmouth Guildhall. Charles Peek was mayor from 1911‚Äì1914 and then again from 1919‚Äì1921. The date on the Charles Peek painting is 1912. This would have been one of the last paintings done by Wimbush as he died 2 years later in 1914. Some of his paintings included a small white dog with black marking which was thought to be his.

The Physics and Technology School is the only high school in Russia belonging to the Russian Academy of Sciences, and regularly places students in international math, physics, and science olympiads.  History  The Physics and Technology School was founded in 1987 by Nobel laureate Zhores Alferov and colleagues at the Ioffe Institute, originally under the administrative umbrella of the Ioffe Institute. The groundwork for the school was laid by two employees of the Ioffe Institute, Igor Alexandrovich Merkulov and Mikhail Georgievich Ivanov, beginning in 1983, who were later joined by the current head of the Ioffe computer center, Andrei Aleksandrovich Fursenko. In 1984, the three convinced Vladimir Maksimovich Tuchkevich, the director of the Ioffe Institute, and with his help received permission to create a vocational school. However, the funds were still not in place in 1986. Towards the end of 1986, Zhores Alferov became a supporter of project, and with Alferov taking over from Tuchkevich as the director of the Ioffe Institute in 1987, funds were secured to found the school in 1987. The first classes began in September 1987. In 2009, PhTS was officially joined with the St. Petersburg Academic University, also founded by Zhores Alferov. The St. Petersburg Academic University was first founded by Alferov as the Research and Education Center of the Ioffe Institute in 1997, and then received a charter to become a university in 2002. The Physics and Technology secondary school and the Academic University had been located on the same campus site, but the organizational change in 2009 integrated them into the same administrative structure. The St. Petersburg Academic Institute has a three-part structure; it joins the Russian Academy of Sciences, a national organizing body for professional scientists, with the university structure of the Academic Institute, offering M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, as well as with the Physics and Technology School secondary school. Due to this unique structure, the PhTS is the only high school in Russia that is a part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. One of Alferov's goals in creating the Academic Institute structure was to invigorate a leading scientific research institute with the exposure to gymnasium students, creating a pipeline of future scientific researchers.  Class body and achievements  PhTS class body is roughly 200 students, with grades 8 through 11. The available majors include physics, mathematics, computer science, and English. Students of PhTS place annually in the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), and additional International Science Olympiads. The Physics and Technology School is regularly ranked second overall among high schools in St. Petersburg, with the Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239 specializing in mathematics placing first.  Teaching staff  A significant portion of the Physics and Technology School teaching staff have PhDs, due to the integration with the Saint Petersburg Academic University. A number of the teaching staff graduated from PhTS lyceum themselves; as of 2019 twelve of the 26 full-time and 25 part-time teachers were graduates of the PhTS.  Notable alumni  From 1989 through 2018, 1514 students graduated from PhTS. Notable alumni include * Dmitry Feichtner-Kozlov (1990)  Partnerships and funding  PhTS has several learning exchanges with the United States, an initiative begun by Alferov. One such exchange is with the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy high school founded by Leon Lederman. Alferov spent 6 months at the University of Illinois in 1970 and built lasting relationships with scientists there. In addition to the Foundation for Support of Education in Society (Alferov Foundation), PhTS lists the Open Society Institute founded by George Soros and Siemens in Russia as funding sources.

It reports and visualizes scraped data on the property rental marketplace company Airbnb, focusing on highlighting illegal renting on the site and gentrification caused by landlords buying properties to rent on Airbnb. History Cox, an Australian-American community activist who moved to Brooklyn in 2008, first scraped information from the Airbnb website in 2014 and compared it to a public data release from the company in December 2015 for New York City. Working with a Canadian, Tom Slee, he found the company had removed over 1000 listings that violated New York's multiple dwelling law just before the data was released. They published a report titled \\"How Airbnb‚Äôs Data Hid the Facts in New York City\\" in February 2016. Airbnb said the listings were removed for violating policy, and it has since enforced a \\"one host, one home\\" policy in New York. Inside Airbnb has since published several more reports, including on how the service affects affordable housing in Los Angeles. After initially welcoming Airbnb with little regulation, Australian local government has used Inside Airbnb data following concerns about pressure on housing supply and affordability. As of 2019, the site provides data on 80 cities around the world. Reception Airbnb says Cox's scraped data are inaccurate, because not all listings are active, some properties may be listed multiple times, and Inside Airbnb reports mean income rather than their preferred metric of median income, but Prof. David Wachsmuth of McGill University says the data are a good representation. Nicole Gurran and Peter Phibbs of the University of Sydney found that \\"This data source has some critical limitations ... Nevertheless, the data provide a useful basis for examining and monitoring Airbnb practices and penetration across local and regional housing markets\\". Airbnb has repeatedly criticised the site, including calling it \\"garbage\\", though Cox met with representatives from the company in February 2019. Funding As of 2019, the site costs around $10,000 per year to operate, with those costs covered by cities, researchers, and the hotel trade paying for data access.

Directed by Amy Winfrey and written by Nick Adams, it was released on Netflix on October 25, 2019, alongside the first half of the sixth season. At the 47th Annie Awards, this episode was selected to represent the show in the category of Best General Audience Animated Television/Broadcast Production and went on to win the award.  Plot  Princess Carolyn's nanny quits her job after complaining about the schedule. From then on, the episode uses visual copies of Princess Carolyn to represent her multiple maternal responsibilities. At work, her assistant Stuart reminds her about a photoshoot for Manatee Fair magazine's \\"Hollywoo Women Who Do It All\\" issue. Due to her duties with the baby, Princess Caroline tells Amanda Hannity she cannot go to the shoot, but soon changes her mind when Hannity tells the story of Karen Kitada, the creator of a successful television series whose career started to collapse after having a baby. After Todd is fired from What Time Is It Right Now, Princess Carolyn asks him to babysit while she is at the photoshoot. Princess Carolyn dozes off as Todd speaks and misses what he says, only hearing \\"Sure, I'd be happy to\\", leading Princess Carolyn to drop the baby with him. At the photoshoot, the other guests discuss organizing an event in support of women like themselves. Though exhausted, Princess Carolyn reluctantly agrees to participate, and eventually winds up with all of the responsibilities of organizing. Overtired and overwhelmed by demands from the event, her career, and motherhood, Princess Carolyn is mistaken as drunk, and is checked into BoJack's rehab facility. She falls asleep on a porch and wakes up two days later. Upon arriving at the now-finished event, she converses with Vanessa Gekko about her struggles and doubts as a mother. Gekko reassures her that her baby is just another job. Ahead of the women's event, Princess Carolyn, on her way out of the clinic, calls Todd asking about the baby. Todd actually said he was busy, but since Princess Carolyn did not hear, she forced him into caring for the child. At a meeting he had scheduled, Todd mentioned \\"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project\\" (the baby's temporary name) and rumors spread among television producers about a potential Princess Carolyn project. Princess Carolyn takes advantage of the situation‚Äîduring a meeting with Pinky, she sells Pinky on the Birthday Dad script as a television show, with Kitada as showrunner. The episode ends with Princess Carolyn settling on the name 'Ruthie' for the baby.  Critical response  \\"The New Client\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Les Chappell of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating, commenting, \\"It's an episode about trying to have it all that almost manages to have it all itself.\\" He also praised Princess Carolyn's lead, the episode's visual effects, and the overall story arc. Hannah Giorgis of The Atlantic glorified the scene between Princess Carolyn and Vanessa Gekko, noting the potential changes in the former character. She wrote, \\"Though it focuses on a character with relative financial comfort and career stability, 'The New Client' effortlessly weaves Princess Carolyn's struggles into the show's ongoing critique of the capitalist entertainment industry. In the past, BoJack has taken aim at greedy studio executives, mega- conglomerates, and wealthy celebrities, and the new episode also nods to the recent writers' strikes that have shaken up Hollywood.\\"  References   External links  * \\"The New Client\\" on Netflix * Category:BoJack Horseman episodes Category:2019 American television episodes ","title":"The New Client"},{"id":"62238302","text":"Ragna Ahlb√§ck (1914-2002) was a Finnish ethnographer and archivist.

Biography  Hussein Mohammed was a Muslim and either a Nubian or Kakwa. At some point, he joined the Uganda Army, and rose in the ranks despite being illiterate, serving as corporal by 1968. Ugandan Colonel Bernard Rwehururu speculated that Hussein was deeply involved in the preparations of the 1971 Ugandan coup d'√©tat which brought Amin to power. He quickly rose to higher commands under the new regime, though the exact timing of his promotions is disputed. Rwehururu stated that Hussein was directly promoted to lieutenant colonel after the coup, whereas businessman Conrad Nkuutu claimed that Hussein was colonel and served as \\"Garrison Commander\\" of the Gaddafi Barracks in Jinja by 1973. Journalist Faustin Mugabe described Hussein as lieutenant colonel and \\"Commanding Officer\\" in Jinja by March 1974. In contrast, the BBC reported that Hussein was still major by 1975, and was appointed lieutenant colonel in April of that year. In any case, Hussein played an important role in quelling dissent during Amin's rule. In January 1973, Military Intelligence officers kidnapped Minister for Works Shaban Nkutu at Jinja. Nkutu's family asked Jinja's District Commissioner Mzee Hezron Kakuyo for help. Suspecting that the Gaddafi Battalion was involved in the minister's disappearance, Kakuyo contacted Hussein. The two met at Crested Crane Hotel, where Hussein angrily rebuffed Kakuyo's appeals for Nkutu's life, falsely claiming that the minister \\"has already been freed by the army and returned to his residence at Rippon Gardens (Jinja). Find him there and never ask me about him again!\\" Idi Amin's government later declared Nkutu a traitor; the minister's body was eventually found floating in the Nile. In March 1974, Amin was almost overthrown in a coup attempt. To appease the disquieted soldiery, he appointed Mustafa Adrisi Chief of Staff. Adrisi promptly vowed to \\"crack down on errant soldiers\\" who abused their power, one of whom was Amin's own brother Idi Nebbi (alias \\"Moshe Amin\\"). To teach the latter a lesson, Adrisi forced Nebbi into the boot of his car and ordered him driven to Jinja. Upon arriving there, the driver reported to Hussein who telephoned the Chief of Staff, telling him that \\"your driver has reported to me with the 'luggage' inside the boot.\\" He then sent the two back to Adrisi. Terrified by the experience, Nebbi consequently behaved better; other soldiers heard of the story, and discipline in the Uganda Army improved. In April 1975, Hussein was promoted to head of the entire Gaddafi Battalion by President Amin during a meeting at Nakasero officers' mess, succeeding Isaac Maliyamungu. When the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War broke out, the Gaddafi Battalion helped to secure eastern Uganda. Rebels crossed the border and attacked the town of Tororo on 2‚Äì4 March 1979. The Gaddafi Battalion helped to repulse the raid. Regardless, the war turned against Uganda, and the country's capital Kampala fell to the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) and allied rebels on 10‚Äì11 April 1979. The new Ugandan government was installed and appealed to the remaining Uganda Army forces to give up. Hussein was reportedly inclined to do so, and addressed his men at the Gaddafi Battalion barracks. A police officer later claimed that many soldiers were violently opposed to surrender, as they belonged to the West Nile tribes and feared execution as partisans of Amin. Fighting broke out among the troops, and the battalion disintegrated. With his troops no longer following orders, Hussein deserted his post and fled to Kenya in early April, accompanied by \\"many\\" other soldiers of the battalion. He surrendered at the border crossing of Malaba. The Kenyan government granted him asylum, and he consequently relocated to Nairobi. According to journalist Jonathan C.R., Hussein's defection was \\"the final proof that Amin was abandoned by all but the diehards\\". His flight reportedly left \\"no one\\" in control of Jinja. Regardless, some troops of the Gaddafi Battalion continued to resist until Jinja was captured by the TPDF on 22 April 1979.

Tudor Revival features include \\"distinctive round-head windows in the English Tudor style\\" and its \\"steeply-pitched front gables\\". According to its National Register nomination, \\"the history of the property begins in 1935, when the Smoot family obtained the land and transferred a herd of dairy cows to Centerville. Until a devastating fire in 1963, the Smoot Dairy was one of the largest privately owned dairy farms in Utah. The farmhouse, which also served as an office, was one of only two buildings to survive the fire. Within a year of the fire, with aid from their Centerville neighbors, the Smoot family built the most modern dairy operation in the state. The period of significance ends in 1964 with the phoenix-like rise of the Smoot Dairy. During the historic period, the Smoot Dairy sold milk on site and made deliveries to an estimated 2,000 households in Centerville and the surrounding communities. The Smoot Dairy provided dairy products to numerous restaurants and hotels in the larger cities of the Wasatch Front, and was the regional dairy provider for United Airlines for thirty-two years.

A large white mob seized Jameson after he allegedly shot the local sheriff. They tied him to a stake and burned him alive. Background Arkansas was on edge after the deadly Elaine massacre (September 30‚ÄìOctober 1, 1919) in Elaine in rural Arkansas. During the riots, hundreds of black people were killed and according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, \\"the Elaine Massacre was by far the deadliest racial confrontation in Arkansas history and possibly the bloodiest racial conflict in the history of the United States.\\" On November 7, 1919, Columbia County Sheriff Benjamin E. Greer, was heading to the Jordan Jameson house along with deputies Duke Emerson and John Althin. While at the house an altercation broke out which escalated to a shoot out where Greer was shot in the head. In the confusion, Jameson escaped into the forest. Lynching Picture shows the view from the public square where Jameson burnt to death As word spread that Greer had been killed a white mob quickly formed and started to patrol the area on the lookout for Jameson. At 1:00 AM on November 11, 1919, a posse of ten men: J. T. Bussey, Will Moody, Otha Dickson, Charles Dickson, Charley White, J. A. Sands, Monroe Henry, Ernest Kimball, W. M. Owen, and Will Toland found Jameson and his wife in a house. He was coaxed outside with a promise that the men wouldn't hurt his wife. After Greer had been killed Governor Charles Hillman Brough appointed Dave Futch as the new sheriff of Magnolia. He tried to bring the situation under control and arrest Jameson but the mob refused to listen or listen to the local law enforcement. On November 11, 1919, at around 5:00 a.m., Jameson was taken to the public square of the city of Magnolia and tied to a stake. Flammable material was stacked around him and in front of a growing crowd of people, it was lit on fire slowly burning Jameson alive. His body was eventually turned over to the black community. Aftermath These race riots were one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. Terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively. Both had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching into the millions of dollars.

The event commemorated the creation of The Crash Lucha Libre in November 2011 and is their biggest show of the year. The main event was a traditional lucha libre best-two-out-of- three falls six-man tag team match, the most common match type in Mexico, that saw independent circuit top workers Jeff Hardy, Rey F√©nix, and Rey Mysterio Jr. facd and defeat Jeff Cobb, Nicho el Millonario, and Teddy Hart two falls to one. Flamita successfully defended The Crash Cruiserweight Championship against Extreme Tiger when the referee stopped the match after Extreme Tiger hurt his shoulder during the match. The show also introduced the brand-new The Crash Women's Championship, which Sexy Dulce won by Keira in a Singles match. The show featured three additional matches. Production =Background= The Crash Lucha Libre began operating on 2011, focusing mainly on promotion professional wrestling event in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. Their first show was held on November 4, 2011 with a main event of El Hijo del Santo and Latin Lover defeating El Hijo del Solitario and Marco Corleone. The Crash held shows on a limited schedule over the next couple of years; 4 in 2012, 4 in 2013, 2 in 2014, and 5 in 2015. The Crash V Aniversario show on November 26, 2016, was the first time they billed one of their shows as a direct celebration of their anniversary. In subsequent years The Crash has held an Aniversario show each year, building them into their biggest show of the year. Event The Crash V Aniversario show featured six professional wrestling matches scripted by The Crash with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform in the ring. Aftermath Flamita would remain The Crash Cruiserweight Champion until June 2, 2017 where he lost the title to Rey Horus, ending his reign after 293 days. After becoming the first The Crash Women's Champion, Sexy Dulce held the title for 290 until April 5, 2017 when she lost a match to Keira that also included Lacey Lane and Santana Garrett where she was not pinned.

It is the oldest known described member of the Rajiformes, and is based on a single tooth from Pliensbachian of Northern Germany. It was recovered fom the Grimmen Clay Pit, on Spinatum strata that belongs in the region to the Komorowo Formation.Menning, M., Pie≈Ñkowski, G., K√§ding, K. C., Maletz, J., Kemnitz, H., Kramer, W., ... & Hi√ü, M. (2020). Korrekturen und Erg√§nzungen zur Stratigraphischen Tabelle von Deutschland 2016 (STD 2016). Zeitschrift der Deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Geowissenschaften. The holotype is a single antero- lateral tooth, very small and slightly asymmetrical, measuring 0.25 mm in maximum height and 0.26 mm in maximum width, that has an overall morphology, that suggests a consistent referral to Batomorphii, encompassing all skates and rays. The tooth has an overall rather gracile crown morphology, different from any other know jurassic batomorphs, indicating closest affinities to the monotypic genus Engaibatis schultzei from the Kimmeridgian-Tithonian of Tanzania. Paleoenvironment The Late Pliensbachian level of the Grimmen clay pit was trougth to be part of the Allenstein (Olsztyn Formation), but due to be composed by sandstones there was an strong disagreement linking the fluvial Olsztyn with Germany, as comes from the Mazury area - easternmost part of the Polish basin and there is no link with the local Amaltheenton Beds, unlike the Komorowo Formation. The described tooth of Antiquaobatis is considered to come from allochthonous origin, as it has suffered massively from post-mortem breakage in many cases, most probably due to extensive reworking and redistribution generated by current activities. This taxon probably lived on the marine areas that were located in closer proximity to the Fennoscandian mainland, such as the paralic depositional environments of the Sorthat Formation of Bornholm, Denmark.Michelsen, O., L.H. Nielsen, P.N. Johannessen, J. Andsbjerg, and F. Surlyk. 2003. Jurassic lithostratigraphy and stratigraphic development onshore and offshore Denmark. Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland Bulletin 1: 147‚Äì216. But also can have been moved from the Polish Basin, as on the deposition of this Tooth it was flooded by the sea, as proven by the find on ammonites on central Poland.Barth, G., Pie≈Ñkowski, G., Zimmermann, J., Franz, M., & Kuhlmann, G. (2018). Palaeogeographical evolution of the Lower Jurassic: high-resolution biostratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy in the Central European Basin. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 469(1), 341-369. A Nectobenthic lifestyle has been suggested for Jurassic batomorphs, specially complete taxa such as Belemnobatis and Spathobatis, that are superficially similar to extant members of which are generally characterized by sharing a bauplan similar to extant Rhinobatidae, adapted to eat hard-shelled prey.Delsate, D., and L.

Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© des Naturalistes Luxembourgeois 102: 131‚Äì143. Antiquaobatis grimmenensis appears to have used different, less specialized and probably more opportunistic feeding strategies, as suggested by the gracile and high tooth morphology.

Early years Gƒôbarowicz was born in Jaros≈Çaw, one of three sons in a patriotic Polish family. His mother was Bronis≈Çawa, n√©e Smolek. with an extensive bibliography, from a lecture given at the Archdiocese of Warsaw Museum His father, Teofil, was a railway engineer who served as assistant station master in Stanis≈Çaw√≥w and later as station master in Buczacz. In 1912 he completed his schooling at Buczacz Lyceum and was already a member of two youth organisations, \\"Zet\\" and \\"Zarzewie\\".Sprawozdanie Dyrekcyi C. K. Gimnazyum w Buczaczu za rok szkolny 1912. Buczacz: Nak≈Çadem Funduszu Naukowego, z Drukarni Stanis≈Çawa Ku≈∫niarskiego w Ja≈õle, 1912, p. 91. He went on to study History and the History of Art at Lw√≥w University. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I when he served in the ranks of the Austro-Hungarian Army (1915‚Äì1918). At the end of that conflict he took part in the Defence of Lw√≥w with Polish forces during the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War, after which he was able to graduate. Between 1920 and 1922 he was a lecturer in the History faculty of Jan Kazimierz University in a newly independent Poland. In 1921 he was awarded a doctoral degree at the university. In 1922 he took up a post in the National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute, known as the \\"Ossolineum\\" in Lw√≥w, where the following year, he was promoted to curator of the Lubomirski Museum. He continued with academic duties and undertook research and lecturing assignments in Italy, France. Belgium, Spain, Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. In 1928 he became an Assistant professor in the History of Art the Department of Humanities at the university. In 1936 he became Honorary professor at Jan Kazimierz University. Between 1923 and 1938 he also lectured in Art History in the faculty of Architecture at Lw√≥w Polytechnic. World War II After the outbreak of the war and the sudden death on 18 September 1939 of Ludwik Bernacki, the director of the Ossolineum, Gƒôbarowicz found himself alongside Kazimierz Tyszkowski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wis≈Çocki, one of three directors of the Institute. In December 1939 the Soviet authorities had inserted as director, their Polish Communist place-man, Jerzy Borejsza. Following the German occupation of Lw√≥w in 1941 and the murder, in unexplained circumstances, of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wis≈Çocki who had been lead director of the Institute, the patron of the institute now allied with the Baworowscy Library, prince Andrzej Lubomirski, covertly nominated Gƒôbarowski as lead director of the institute. Throughout this period until the return in July 1944 of the Soviet occupiers, Gƒôbarowicz strove to safeguard the priceless collections of the Ossolineum. In 1944 still under German occupation, he arranged secretly to despatch with a Krak√≥w-bound German train consignment, 2,300 literary manuscripts. These included works by Juliusz S≈Çowacki, Aleksander Fredro, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Reymont, Henryk Sienkiewicz and Adam Mickiewicz's original of Pan Tadeusz. In addition there were 2,400 Polish works on paper, prints and several hundred numismatic items which would later become the nucleus of the relocated Ossolineum in Wroc≈Çaw. Gƒôbarowicz decided to remain in Lwow when the renewed occupation began. Post-war Commemorative plaque at 9, Senatorska street in Lviv where Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz lived for 50 years 1946 saw Gƒôbarowicz become deputy manager of the Faculty of Theory and History of Art of the renamed Ivan Franko National University of Lviv. Thanks to his efforts, in July 1946 as \\"a gift of the Soviet People to the People of Poland\\" a further 7,083 manuscripts, 35,565 antiquarian books and 107,397 prints from the 19th and 20th centuries arrived in Wroc≈Çaw. In March 1947 a further 67,000 books followed. His decision to stay in the city as custodian of the remaining Polish heritage in Lw√≥w was conditional on his accepting Soviet citizenship and rejecting not only the offer to become director of the National Museum in Krakow, but also the offers of professorships at the Universities of Wroclaw and Toru≈Ñ. Along with other long-term employees of the Library, in February 1950 he was dismissed on the grounds of being an \\"undesirable element\\". He was later able to find work as a librarian in various Lviv institutions that recognised his status as that of a \\"junior researcher\\". He first travelled to the Polish People's Republic in 1957 and declined an offer to become director of the Ossolineum in Wroc≈Çaw. Not until 1962, when he was aged 69, did the Soviet authorities offer him advancement to \\"senior researcher\\". Later that year he was forced into retirement as a probable reprisal for the publication in Poland of his \\"Study of the history of the arts in Late Renaissance Poland\\". An additional punishment was to bar him from access to the archives in his erstwhile national collection. Nevertheless, Poland awarded him a medal in 1970 for developing the National Ossoli≈Ñski Institute. In 1981 the Historical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences commissioned him to write an autobiography as part of a compendium of biographies of leading Polish academics. The Polish authorities balked at his completed manuscript and it could only be published a year later by a small Catholic publisher, ZNAK.Mieczys≈Çaw Gƒôbarowicz, Autobiografia. Jeden ≈ºywot w s≈Çu≈ºbie nauki. Znak 5. 1982 He was the author of a considerable number of research papers despite his straitened circumstances and no access to the Ossolineum sources. Two well received studies on the art of the Ukraine and of Lw√≥w were published posthumously: his The oldest iconostasis of the volosian orthodox church in Lw√≥w (Wroc≈Çaw 2016) and Mater Misericordiae - Pokrow - Pokrowa in the art and legends of East-Central Europe (Wroc≈Çaw 1986). Gƒôbarowicz died in Lviv in 1984 and was buried at Lyczakow cemetery in the city. He was remembered as the \\"Pope of the Polish diaspora\\" in Lw√≥w.

Jewish tradition states that Ezra is the author of Ezra-Nehemiah as well as the Book of Chronicles,Babylonian Talmud Baba Bathra 15a, apud Fensham 1982, p. 2 but modern scholars generally accept that a compiler from the 5th century BCE (the so-called \\"Chronicler\\") is the final author of these books. The section comprising chapters 7 to 10 mainly describes the activities of Ezra the scribe and the priest. This chapter focuses on the commission of Ezra by Artaxerxes I of Persia, and the start of his journey from Babylon to Jerusalem. Text This chapter is divided into 28 verses. The original text of verses 1‚Äì11 is in Hebrew language,Note g on Ezra 6:19 in NKJV: \\"The Hebrew language resumes in Ezra 6:19 and continues through 7:11\\". verses 12‚Äì26 are in Aramaic,Note b on Ezra 7:12 in NKJV: \\"The original language of Ezra 7:12‚Äì26 is Aramaic\\". and verses 27‚Äì28 are in Hebrew again.Note i on Ezra 7:27 in NKJV: \\"The Hebrew language resumes in Ezra 7:27.\\" =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew/Aramaic are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). An ancient Greek book called 1 Esdras (Greek: ) containing some parts of 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah is included in most editions of the Septuagint and is placed before the single book of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah (which is titled in Greek: ). 1 Esdras 8:1-27 is an equivalent of Ezra 7 (In Artaxerxes' reign).Catholic Encyclopedia: Esdras: THE BOOKS OF ESDRAS: III EsdrasJewish Encyclopedia: Esdras, Books of: I Esdras Ezra the man and the mission (7:1‚Äì10) This part introduces Ezra, a priest and devout teacher of the Mosaic Law, the leader of another group of Jews leaving Babylonia for Jerusalem during the reign of Artaxerxes the king of Persia, thereby skipping almost sixty years of history about the remaining years of Darius and the entire reign of Xerxes. Ezra's priestly heritage (verses 1‚Äì5, cf. ) connects him to the great priests in history (ultimately to Phinehas, Eleazar, and Aaron the high priests) to validate his authority, before presenting his devotion and integrity (verse 6). Verses 7‚Äì10 contains the summary of Ezra's journey. =Verses 1‚Äì6= : Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the high priest‚Äî this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, given by the Lord God of Israel. Because the hand of the Lord his God was upon him, the king granted him all his requests. MEV *\\"A scribe\\": Ezra was a \\"teacher\\" well versed in the Law of Moses, which was given by \\"the LORD, the God of Israel\\". The term \\"teacher\\" can also translate as \\"scribe\\", denoting \\"a person skilled in the study, practice, and teaching of the Torah\\". This position gained importance in the postexilic community and increased in influence through the time of Jesus. Ezra's highest commendation was that he was a skilled student of the Pentateuch and an effective teacher of its laws, therefore he was commissioned because the Persian government sought to solidify Jerusalem and Judea as a temple state, but for the Jews his arrival is \\"the next essential step\\" to follow the completion of the temple with the establishment of \\"religions purity as prescribed by the Mosaic Law\\". The king had granted Ezra everything he asked, although it remains uncertain what was requested, but the statement indicates the high regard in which he was held by the Persian court. Nonetheless, 'the ultimate determination of blessing and judgment rested with God'. =Verse 7= :And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.

The straightline distance from Babylon to Jerusalem is over 500 miles, but following traditional route, Ezra‚Äôs caravan should make a long detour by Carchemish to avoid the desert area, so the total journey could hardly have been less than 900 miles (cf.

In 1997 while an official in the Moscow-based Russian mission in Jerusalem, Mark (Golovkov) played a critical role along with then Patriarch Alexy II in conving Yasser Arafat in expelling the owners of Mount of Olives Monastery, the only Eastern Orthodox monastery and church in the city of Hebron. The church had been under the property of the Russian Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), but after dispute over custody, the hierarchy of the Moscow Patriarchate asked the Palestinian authorities to forcibly remove the current contingent. Mark (Golovkov) spoke to the media, saying: \\"We're ready to receive them all, but for a long time, the Mount of Olives Monastery did not allow Russian priests to enter. Muslims, Jews, atheists, Buddhists can enter, but God forbid that a Russian priest enter.

The switchover itself took place between 24 July 2011 and 31 March 2012, and involved television stations across all five major commercial networks, the entire network of NHK's broadcast transmitters, and television stations that are part of the JAITS group. Japan was the first country in eastern Asia to cease broadcasting television signals in analog. Background On 1 December 2003, the five major television stations in Tokyo became the first broadcasters to begin broadcasting in digital. Unlike analog television (which used NTSC-J and relied mainly on VHF signals (channels 1‚Äì12) in large markets and UHF signals (channels 13‚Äì52) in smaller markets), digital television (which uses ISDB) totally relies on the utilisation of UHF signals. For this reason, the digital channels had to be amended in some areas of the country so that they do not coexist with the then-existing analog channels. This process took place between February 2003 and March 2007. This was not the first time, however, that digital television began appearing in Japan, as the NHK's Broadcasting Satellite services began broadcasting in digital in December 2000. Those services, however, were open only to those with digital satellite systems. The MUSE Hi-Vision system, which began broadcasting in 1991, was switched off permanently on 30 September 2007, almost four years after the first digital terrestrial broadcasts began. Technology Televisions without digital receivers required ISDB-T converter boxes or DVD recorders in order to convert the digital signal into a receivable analog signal. Many of the old analog-era devices had standard image quality, but the digital televisions and tuners that were distributed in the first few years of digital terrestrial broadcasts were only usable for a limited amount of time. As a result of this, the initial cost of digital equipment was expensive; in mid-2007, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications requested television manufacturers to release specialized digital tuners for around ¬•5,000 or lower. Although digital television tuners became widely available to the general population, low income households could not be able to afford the cost of the tuners themselves, even after the prices of the tuners themselves decreased between 2008 and 2010. The ministry responded by distributing tuners free of charge to all low income households; this prevented a situation that would have been similar to the coupon-eligible converter box program during the 2009 digital switchover in the United States. Unlike the United States, however, new antenna equipment was also required on the top of any building that was equipped with a digital television tuner. This led to reception issues in the months preceding the planned switchover. Digital broadcasts could be received with little or no issues within the transmission error's processing capability, but could not be received at all if this capability is exceeded. Process As a result of the confusion that was arisen with regards to the transmission of the analog and digital broadcast signals at the same time, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications implemented several measures to ease confusion in the time leading up to the digital switchover. Beginning on 24 July 2008, three years before the planned shutdown of the analog transmitters themselves, a permanent DOG was placed on the top right corner of the screen to indicate the analog broadcast. This would change as follows: * July 2008‚Äìearly 2009: Analog and digital transmissions would look the same with the exception of the permanent DOG indicating the analog broadcast. * Early 2009‚Äìearly 2010: The analog signal would begin to be broadcast in a 16:9 letterbox format until the end of the transition, with the permanent DOG being placed in the top right corner of the letterbox area. * Early 2010‚Äìlate 2010: All programs on the analog signal, except for some commercials, would be broadcast in a letterbox format. * Late 2010‚Äì2011: Information regarding the analog signal's shutdown date, as well as telephone numbers set up by the ministry for inquiries, would have to be displayed inside the letterbox areas at all times during all programming, except for some commercials. This would continue until shortly before the shutoff of all analog transmitters. =2008‚Äì2009= Between October 2008 and February 2009, the ministry opened up the local service in all 47 prefectures of Japan, which would serve customers who had inquiries about the digital transition. These agencies were available as alternatives to the national service, which itself utilized Navi Dial. On 6 April 2009, the northeastern portion of Ishikawa Prefecture (corresponding to the cities of Suzu and Noto) was chosen by the ministry as the test market for the digital transition; other areas of the country were expected to conduct similar tests. Periodically throughout the year, analog broadcasts would be suspended for a certain amount of time on some days. Delivery of all digital tuners to the mentioned areas of northeastern Ishikawa was expected to be completed by 30 November 2009. =2010= Letterbox format of analog broadcasts used between 2009 and the middle of 2011. Information regarding the digital transition began to appear in the letterbox areas in late 2010. Beginning on 22 January 2010, analog broadcasts of all commercial television stations in the northeastern part of Ishikawa Prefecture were suspended for a total of 48 hours; KTK, HAB, MRO, and ITC participated in the digital television transition test. NHK was excluded from the test as they were the official conduit of emergency information in the area. On 24 July 2010 at noon, the first phase of the digital switchover began in the northeastern part of Ishikawa Prefecture (which served approximately 8,800 households at the time of digitalization); the auxiliary transmitters of all five television stations serving the area were immediately switched off at that time. Beginning in September 2010, all television stations were required to display information about the digital television transition in the area of the analog television broadcast that is covered by the letterboxes. This continued until just before noon on the day of the digital switchover, albeit with minor updates being inserted periodically. =2011= T≈çhoku earthquake reaction The 11 March 2011 earthquake in Tohoku devastated many households in the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima, where major power and water outages were reported. Rolling blackouts in some areas of the country that were not seriously affected by the earthquake would take place for the remainder of March; this required the analog auxiliary transmitters in the Kant≈ç region to stop broadcasting for a short period of time. On 22 April 2011, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that the shutdown of analog transmitters in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures would be postponed for up to a year following the original shutdown date of 24 July 2011 out of respect for the victims of the disaster; the television stations licensed to those three prefectures would be subsidized for half the cost of maintaining the old analog equipment. The final transition date in those areas would be moved to 31 March 2012 per an announcement made on 5 July 2011. Shutdown of analog services Warning broadcast after the end of regular programming on the analog signal as broadcast by commercial stations. On 1 July 2011, television stations across 44 of the 47 prefectures that were scheduled to shut down their analog services on the original date began displaying a countdown clock in the lower left corner of the screen indicating the number of days remaining until the analog services ended. Seventeen days later, the ministry's digital television call center hours were temporarily extended to accommodate additional inquiries. On 24 July 2011 at noon, regularly scheduled programming ended on all analog signals in 44 of the country's 47 prefectures, as well as on WOWOW and the NHK's BS1 and BS Premium channels (the Open University of Japan shuttered analog broadcasts three days earlier). The end of the transmission of regular programs took place minutes before the start of the third game of the 2011 Nippon Professional Baseball All-Star Series, which was being transmitted by TV Asahi. In addition, special episodes of Waratte Iitomo! (which was aired on Fuji Television) and other variety shows covering the digital transition were aired by other television stations. At the stroke of noon, all programming on the analog signal was replaced with a white-on-blue warning message signifying the end of regular programming, as well as the phone numbers of the digital television call center and the television station's inquiry helpline. This message, which varied between stations in different prefectures but maintained the same basic format, was aired continuously for about twelve hours; the transmitters themselves signed off the air shortly before midnight on that day (with stations in most areas airing legal sign-off notices as well). This was necessary because the ministry changed the transmitter shutoff time from noon to midnight due to technical reasons. =2012: Shutdown of analog services in eastern T≈çhoku= In February 2012, there was a consolidation of digital television call centers in areas where the switchover was already completed. On 12 March 2012, the sixteen television stations serving the area that was impacted by the 2011 earthquake (Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures) began displaying the aforementioned countdown clock. As with the earlier shutdown, the business hours of the digital television call centers in all three prefectures were temporarily extended as well. When regular programming on the analog signal ended at noon on 31 March 2012, the aforementioned warning messages were still displayed as usual, but there was no fanfare except for those that were broadcast by both NHK and TBC shortly before regular programming ended. At midnight that same day, the analog transmitters themselves switched off, marking the completion of the digital switchover in Japan. Cable television Cable television providers across Japan were not initially affected by the digital switchover, as analog cable services were expected to continue for a short amount of time after the transmitters themselves ceased operations. However, some stations that were not part of the country's five major commercial television networks were no longer offered on analog cable after 24 July 2011. By 2015, most analog cable systems ceased operations.

In addition to its overall layout and decoration, it is notable for the first stone domes in Cairo to be carved with geometric star patterns.  Historical background  Complex of Amir Qurqumas (and Sultan Inal) Sultan al-Ashraf Sayf al-Din Barsbay ruled from 1422 to 1438 CE, a relatively long reign for the standards of the Mamluk period in Egypt. During that time, he built at least three notable buildings: the Madrasa of Barsbay, built in 1423-24 (near the beginning of his reign) on al-Muizz Street; his mausoleum complex in the Northern Cemetery, described on this page; and a Friday mosque in the town of al-Khanqa, north of Cairo, in 1437. He apparently had a reputation simultaneously for being greedy and bad- tempered but also for being generous to the poor and to Sufis (the latter tendency being evident in this mausoleum and khanqah complex). His reign was marked by relative security and stability, with few wars or rebellions. However, in 1427 he invaded Cyprus, captured its king (from the House of Lusignan) and forced him to pay tribute. He also diverted the Indian Ocean trade routes through Jeddah (closer to Cairo) and introduced a state monopoly on sugar and pepper. The revenues from this military victory and these trade policies may have helped him finance his construction projects, and may have encouraged him to build this new mausoleum complex in the Northern Cemetery later in his reign (after having already built a madrasa with attached mausoleum in the city center, mentioned above). When Barsbay built this mausoleum and khanqah complex, Faraj ibn Barquq's own nearby khanqah and mausoleum had already been completed a couple decades earlier and a north-to- south road (still present today) had developed between here and the Citadel. Barsbay's own complex was clearly designed around this road, and features elements on both sides of it. His complex was completed in 1432.  Architectural description  The stone dome of left = The mosque and the sultan's mausoleum = This funerary complex includes Barsbay's own royal mausoleum, to which is attached a mosque and prayer hall to the south which is accessed from the street through an entrance portal and vestibule. To the right of the entrance are also two sabils. The minaret on the exterior of the mosque appears to be a crude reconstruction from a later period and does not correspond to the Mamluk architectural style.  The mosque (prayer hall)  alt= The mosque measures about 15 by 20 meters, its longer side being aligned with the road. The interior of the mosque is split into three aisles (running parallel to the street), of which the central one is sunken or lower in relation to the others. The aisles are separated from each other by rows of three arches resting on columns with classical capitals (presumably Roman or Byzantine). The interior's most remarkable feature is the rich and varied multi-coloured marble mosaic pavement which covers the floors (although often obscured under the mosque's carpeting) and even appears on the windowsills. By contast, the walls and the mihrab (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer) are very plain; something seemingly common to Sufi khanqahs but not to regular mosques of the time. The mosque interior receives much light compared to other mosques of the period thanks to the structure's layout and its many windows, which include modern stucco windows carved in traditional patterns. The mosque's painted ceiling is also a later restoration. = The mosque's minbar = Details of the mosque's alt= The mosque today also contains a minbar (pulpit next to the mihrab) that is sometimes cited as the most beautiful and accomplished work of its kind in Cairo. Like most Mamluk minbars of the period it is made of wood and inlaid with ivory across a surface decorated with complex geometric star patterns. One detail that differs from other minbars of this type is that the geometric patterns have slightly curved lines instead of straight lines, subtly enhancing their visual effect. The minbar originally belonged to the Mosque of al-Ghamri which was built in 1451 in the Bab al-Shari'a area of Cairo. It was moved to Barsbay's mosque when al- Ghamri's mosque was demolished in 1884. The craftsman of the minbar is known from historical sources and is named as Ahmad ibn 'Isa al-Dimyati, who was also responsible for constructing minbars for the Mosque of Mecca and the later Mosque of Qijmas al-Ishaqi. The construction of the minbar was originally financed by a merchant and scholar named Ibn al-Radadi.  Barsbay's mausoleum and dome  Barsbay's mausoleum is accessed through the mosque. The interior of the mausoleum, unlike the interior of the mosque, has a mihrab and walls that are lavishly decorated with marble paneling and mosaics inlaid with mother-of-pearl, as are the floor and the sultan's cenotaph/tomb. Just below the dome, the pendentives of the chamber (the transition between the square chamber and the round base of the dome) are sculpted with muqarnas, as was common in Mamluk architecture. The exterior of the stone dome of the mausoleum is carved with a remarkable interlacing geometric star pattern. Along with some of the adjacent tombs in this mausoleum complex (see below), this is the first example of such a geometric pattern carved into the stone domes of Cairo or of Mamluk architecture, marking an important evolution from the earlier, simpler \\"chevron\\" or zig-zag patterns found on the nearby Mausoleums of Faraj ibn Barquq or on the dome of Barsbay's own earlier Madrasa-Mausoleum in the center of Cairo. The arrangement of the mausoleum at the northern end of mosque, standing next to the street and unencumbered by any other architectural elements on three sides, allowed it to be both highly visible from the road as well as accessible to Muslims inside the mosque who could offer prayers to the Sultan's tomb; both important considerations in Mamluk funerary architecture. = Other structures related to the complex =  The khanqah  Remains of the khanqah and its lodgings for the Sufi residents Further south, extending from the mosque and mausoleum but now ruined, is a long structure that acted as part of the khanqah (a lodge and establishment for Sufis) and included living cells for the Sufi residents. Further to the south of the khanqah, on the same side of the street, is another long, semi-ruined building that was once the Takiyya (another type of khanqah) of Ahmad Abu Sayf, also built in the 15th century but not part of Barsbay's original complex.  The other tombs  alt= On the eastern side of these main structures is a musalla (open area for Islamic funerals), and all around this is a cemetery with tombs and several smaller mausoleums belonging to Barsbay's family members and favourite amirs. Two domed mausoleums stand behind the mosque, to the east. The one closest to the mosque has lost its dome and may have been dedicated to Barsbay's parents. The one a little further away, now standing against the eastern wall of the cemetery, consists of a dome raised on top of a structure with open arches and is dedicated to Barsbay's brother Yashbak. The dome of the tomb furthest to the north belongs to an amir called Gani Bak al-Ashrafi, who built his own madrasa complex in the city but who was beloved of Barsbay and buried here instead. According to one author, his tomb is dated to 1427 (earlier than the main complex built in 1432). However, another analysis proposes that it was either built after Barsbay's main dome or that the carved pattern on its dome was executed later, judging by the increased sophistication of the geometric patterns and their arguably better adaption to the curved surface of the dome. The dome of Yasbhbak's tomb (mentioned above) may also be one of the earliest domes carved in this way. Between Barbsay's mausoleum and Gani Bak's tomb stands another tomb (distinguished by its plain dome) which belongs to a Mamluk named Qurqumas (not the same Qurqumas who built his monumental complex further north). It was originally built in 1511 in front of al-Hakim's Mosque on al-Muizz Street, but was moved here when that mosque was restored in the 20th century.  The zawiya and other structures on the west side of the street  zawiya of Barsbay's complex, which was devoted to Sufis of the al-Rifa'i order To the west, across the street from the mosque and mausoleum, was once a zawiya consisting of a domed chamber and a hospice for Sufi travelers. Only the domed structure remains today, which is sometimes identified as the Qubba al-Rifa'i (\\"Dome/tomb of al-Rifa'i\\", referring to the founder of the Sufi order to which the zawiya was dedicated). It was likely used as an oratory or ceremonial hall where Sufi ceremonies such as the dhikr were performed. The interior of the dome chamber was probably redecorated in the 19th century, featuring scallop-shell carving in the triple-niche pendentives, as well as other plasterwork. Further south from here, on the same side of the street but surrounded by modern buildings, is an anonymous tomb which is thought to belong to Barsbay's mother, known as Khadija Umm al-Ashraf, possibly dating to 1440.  Function  While the focus of the complex was the sultan's mausoleum, the attached structures were designed to offer services to a small group of Sufis, a function that was common to many Mamluk funerary establishments in Cairo's cemeteries. The khanqah was devoted to serving 17 Sufis and their leader. The Sufis were from the al-Rifa'i order, which was popular with the common people. The mosque was also listed in the waqf document as a madrasa for teaching 4 Sufi students in Islamic law within the framework of the Hanafi madhhab.

Negative gearing can arise in a number of contexts; for example, with real estate investments, it arises when the net rental income is less than the mortgage loan interest payable, and with shares, when net dividend income is less than the interest payable on a margin loan. General For income tax purposes, Australia allows the offsetting of property losses against other types of income, such as wage or business income, with only a few limits or restrictions. Negative gearing by property investors reduced personal income tax revenue in Australia by $600 million in the 2001/02 tax year, $3.9 billion in 2004/05 and $13.2 billion in 2010/11. Negative gearing continues to be a controversial political issue in Australia and was a major issue during the 2016 and the 2019 Australian federal election, during which the Australian Labor Party proposed restricting but not eliminating negative gearing and to halve the capital gains tax discount to 25%. Analysis found that negative gearing in Australia provides a greater benefit to wealthier Australians than the less wealthy. Federal Treasurer at the time, Scott Morrison, in defence of negative gearing, cited tax data that showed that numerous middle income groups (he mentioned teachers, nurses, and electricians) benefit in larger numbers from negative gearing than finance managers. History Traditionally, Australian taxpayers have been allowed to negatively gear their investment properties, in the strict sense of investing in property at an initial loss. Negative gearing was restricted by a prohibition on the transfer of contingent property income and the property losses could not offset income from labour.Avoidance, Evasion and Reform: Who Dismantled and who's rebuilding the Australian Income Tax System It is assumed this applied to losses as well as income, but this is unclear in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936 In 1983, the Victorian Deputy Commissioner of Taxation briefly denied Victorian property investors the deduction for interest in excess of the rental income, so losses could not be transferred nor moved to a future tax year. That ruling was quickly over-ruled by the federal tax commissioner. The Hawke government's reversion to the earlier system in which property losses could not offset income from labour was unpopular with property investors. These investors claimed this reversion had caused investment in rental accommodation to dry up and rents to rise substantially. This was unsupported by evidence other than localised increases in real rents in both Perth and Sydney, which also had the lowest vacancy rates of all capital cities at the time. Taxation In general, an investor can claim the loss on holding an investment property, reducing the investor's total taxable income accordingly. On the other hand, in some contexts the investment losses are ignored, such as in the case of determining the thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge, the private health insurance rebate and in calculating the HELP Repayment Income, as well as other Centrelink income-tested allowances and benefits. In addition to the tax benefits of negative gearing, the investor would typically would take account of the anticipated increase in the market value of the property and the tax treatment of capital gains under Australian law, which offers a further benefit to investors. For example, if the investor has held an investment property for more than twelve months, then only 50% of the capital gain is taxable. Arguments for and against > It's true, according to Real Estate Institute data, that rents went up in > Sydney and Perth. But the same data doesn't show any discernible increase in > the other state capitals. I would say that, if negative gearing had been > responsible for a surge in rents, then you should have observed it > everywhere, not just two capitals. In fact, if you dig into other parts of > the REI database, what you find is that vacancy rates were unusually low at > that time before negative gearing was abolished. Eslake is referring to changes in inflation-adjusted rents (i.e., when CPI inflation is subtracted from the nominal rent increases). These are also known as real rent changes. Nominal rents nationally rose by over 25% during the two years that negative gearing was quarantined. They rose strongly in every Australian capital city, according to the official ABS CPI data.http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6401.0Mar%202013 However, as nominal changes include inflation, they provide a less clear picture of how rents changed in effect, and of how changes such as disallowing property losses to offset other types of income affect rent. Effect on housing affordability Chart 1: House Price Index and CPI. Source ABS In 2003, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stated in its submission to the Productivity Commission First Home Ownership Inquiry: > there are no specific aspects of current tax arrangements designed to > encourage investment in property relative to other investments in the > Australian tax system. Nor is there any recent tax policy initiative we can > point to that accounts for the rapid growth in geared property investment. > But the fact is that when we observe the results, resources and finance are > being disproportionately channelled into this area, and property promoters > use tax effectiveness as an important selling point. They went on to say that \\"the most sensible area to look for moderation of demand is among investors\\", and that: > the taxation treatment in Australia is more favourable to investors than is > the case in other countries. In particular, the following areas appear > worthy of further study by the Productivity Commission: ::i. ability to > negatively gear an investment property when there is little prospect of the > property being cash-flow positive for many years; ::ii. the benefit that > investors receive by virtue of the fact that when property depreciation > allowances are \\"clawed back\\" through the capital gains tax, the rate of tax > is lower than the rate that applied when depreciation was allowed in the > first place. ::iii. the general treatment of property depreciation, > including the ability to claim depreciation on loss-making investments. Chart 2: Investor Lending ‚Äì New construction vs Existing property. Source ABS, RBA In 2008, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia echoed the findings of the 2004 Productivity Commission report. One recommendation to the enquiry suggested that negative gearing should be capped: \\"There should not be unlimited access. Millionaires and billionaires should not be able to access it, and you should not be able to access it on your 20th investment property. There should be limits to it.\\" A 2015 report from the Senate Economics References Committee argues that, while negative gearing has an influence on housing affordability, the primary issue is a mismatch between supply and demand.

Early life  Arthur W. F. Bligh was born on 27 May 1905 in Mosman, New South Wales to A.C.V. Bligh a grazier and his wife. He became an articled pupil of architect William Hodgen in Toowoomba, Queensland from 1922-1926. He began his own practice as an architect from 1926-33 in Toowoomba and then from 1933 in Brisbane. He became a registered architect in 1929. After taking on domestic, commercial, industrial and ecclesiastical projects in Toowoomba, he moved to Brisbane in 1934. He formed a partnership with Colin Jessup. Bligh was a well known architect of Art Deco style blocks of flats during the 1930s until the war intervened. He volunteered during WW2 in the Australian Army. He was employed by the USA Service Drawing Office in 1942. Following the War he returned to private practice. In 1956 Bligh and Jessup entered into partnership with Athol Bretnall and Ronald Voller. Their practice was named Bligh Jessup Bretnall and Partners. His son, Graham entered the partnership in 1965. The firm is now called Bligh Voller Nield Architects and operates as BVN Architects. In the 1960s the Nicklin government of Queensland was keen to move forward with the 'Bligh Plan' put forward by him for significant urban planning changes. It proposed inner city revival and urban planning, blocking off areas of the city from vehicular access, developing pedestrian precincts, open parkland and the redevelopment of the Roma Street Markets. Arthur Bligh retired in 1974.  Personal life  Bligh married Millie Gaydon in 1930. He died on 8 August 1998 in Brisbane. He was survived by his wife and two sons.

The building opened in August 2019 with a capacity of nearly 4,000 patrons. Operated by AEG Presents Rocky Mountain, the venue is viewed a competitor to the Live Nation operated Fillmore Auditorium. Background The ballroom is a project that took 11 years to come to fruition. Chuck Morris, CEO of AEG Presents Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, helped spearhead the project. After searching for the right spot, it was finally settled on the North Arts District, near the historic Denver Coliseum. With assistance from Westfield Development, the music venue will be the anchor for the North Wynkoop District. This will be a mixed-use development space featuring retail and commercial spaces, a boutique hotel and residential housing. This project is expected to be complete by 2023. The venue was announced to the public in April 2018, with construction beginning shortly afterwards. Initial designs and concepts were submitted in 2016. Morris cites the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Brooklyn Steel and The Anthem as design inspiration. Financed by FirstBank, the 60,000 sqft space will provide patrons with a club experience providing clear sight lines and state-of-the-art lighting and sound. With a sound system designed by D&B; Audiotechnik, the venue will be the first to use a noise- cancelling system that will eliminate muddled noise caused by sounds emanating from the sides and rear of the system's speakers. The space is also designed with a moving stage to accommodate crowds of 2,200 to 3,950. Each configuration can utilize a large dance floor area for general admission, with reserved seating allocated on both sides of the stage. VIP sections are available with a bar area. Speaking about the venue, Don Strasburg, Co- President of AEG Presents Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest stated: > \\"We wanted to come up with a room that was purely focused on live music, but > able to function properly for multiple types of audiences [...] We created a > front row along the balcony rail that will always be general admission. We > know there are certain people who want a higher level of experience, > however, it's really important that the energy from the most die-hard fan, > no matter what their income, goes directly to the artists.\\" Construction completed July 2019. The venue opened on August 7, 2019 with a performance by The Lumineers.

Jewish tradition states that Ezra is the author of Ezra-Nehemiah as well as the Book of Chronicles,Babylonian Talmud Baba Bathra 15a, apud Fensham 1982, p. 2 but modern scholars generally accept that a compiler from the 5th century BCE (the so-called \\"Chronicler\\") is the final author of these books. The section comprising chapters 7 to 10 mainly describes of activities of Ezra the scribe and the priest. This chapter follows Ezra‚Äôs journey to Jerusalem and includes a genealogy of those returning with him (parallel to chapter 2). Text This chapter is divided into 36 verses. The original text of this chapter is in Hebrew language.Note i on Ezra 7:27 in NKJV: \\"The Hebrew language resumes in Ezra 7:27.\\" =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). An ancient Greek book called 1 Esdras (Greek: ) containing some parts of 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah is included in most editions of the Septuagint and is placed before the single book of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah (which is titled in Greek: ). 1 Esdras 8:28-67 is an equivalent of Ezra 8 (List of latter exiles who returned).Catholic Encyclopedia: Esdras: THE BOOKS OF ESDRAS: III EsdrasJewish Encyclopedia: Esdras, Books of: I Esdras The Caravan (8:1‚Äì14) Large groups of Jews had returned to Jerusalem in past years, but many faithful men and their families still lived in Babylonian territories, some of whom at this time packed their belongings and assembled with Ezra to return to Judea. The list in this part is a parallel to the famous Golah List of Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7, but notable here is the predominance of priestly associations before any Davidic identification. =Verse 1= :Now these are the chiefs of the households of the fathers and the genealogical register of those who went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of King Artaxerxes: MEV Emboldened by God‚Äôs involvement (chapter 7), Ezra recruited family heads and those registered with them to accompany him to Jerusalem (as noted in Ezra 2, 'Jewish society was organized around men and their extended families'). =Verse 2= :of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; :of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; :of the sons of David, Hattush, MEV The list begins with the priests, reflecting 'Ezra's own station as a priest', formed by two patriarchal families: the descendants of Phinehas (Gershom) and Ithamar (Daniel), as the two descendants of Aaron the high priest. After listing the priestly line, Ezra registers the political line of Israel, which is the descendants of David (royal line), indicating that 'the memory of Davidic ancestry continued in the postexilic community'.. One family accompanying Ezra, Hattush, is a descendant of David (so called \\"Davidide\\"), and he would be the fourth generation after ZerubbabelSee: Blenkinsopp, J. (1988), \\"Ezra-Nehemiah\\", The Old Testament Library (London: SCM). p. 162; apud Smith-Christopher 2007, p. 316 (cf. : \\" ‚Ä¶the sons of Zerubbabel‚Ä¶ Hananiah‚Ä¶ And the sons of Hananiah‚Ä¶ the sons of Shechaniah. And the sons of Shechaniah‚Ä¶ Shemaiah: and the sons of Shemaiah‚Ä¶ Hattush‚Ä¶\\"). The record of \\"Hattush\\" 'makes any other date than 458 [BC] difficult'. Final preparations (8:15‚Äì30) Before departing from Babylonia. Ezra enlisted Levites to join his caravan, as well as 'called for a general fast to petition God's protection, and entrusted the money and valuable articles to consecrated priests'. =Verse 15= :Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And I looked among the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there. NKJV The presence of the Levites (\\"sons of Levi\\") was significant to Ezra because, under Law of Torah, the Levites were 'responsible for the transport of temple articles'. =Verse 22= :For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him. MEV In contrast to Nehemiah, who accepted an armed guard, Ezra chose to rely on God's protection (cf. ; ). The journey (8:31‚Äì32) Completing all the preparations, Ezra and his caravan 'embarked on the journey' from Babylonia to Jerusalem. =Verse 31= :Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. KJV *\\"The river of Ahava\\": Vulgate: \\"the river Ahava\\"; Latin: \\"a fiumine Ahava\\"; the meeting place probably takes its name from the stream. Ahava was reached by Ezra and his company on the ninth day after they left Babylon (cf. Ezra 7:9, Ezra 8:15), which helps Rawlinson to identify Ahava with \\"Is\\" as mentioned in Herodotus (i. 179), which is eight days' journey from Babylon.Exell, Joseph S.; Spence-Jones, Henry Donald Maurice (Editors).

Ezra 8. Accessed 28 April 2019. Taking care of business (8:33‚Äì36) This part records that Ezra meticulously transferred the articles and finances, performed the required rituals of sacrifices, and delivered the edict of the Persian king. =Verse 35= :Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the Lord. KJV After Ezra's group safely arrived in Jerusalem (verses 31‚Äì32), they offered sacrifice (verse 35), not because king Artaxerxes ordered them to do (), nor as an \\"isolated act of thanksgiving\\", but because \\"they were reconstituted as the people of God and therefore must worship\\" God.

History  The congregation takes its name from the admiration that Claire Monest√®s had for the missionary work of Francis Xavier, who was one of Ignatius of Loyola's early companions. Ignatius, soon after founding the Society of Jesus, decided that the Society would not accept women. There are therefore no women Jesuits or Jesuit sisters as such, but many women's communities are inspired by Ignatian spirituality.

It was not until 1960 that the community foundations in France came together again, those at Cr√©teil, Toulouse, Nice, La Rochelle, and Aix-en-Provence. In 1967 they extended their work to Abidjan, Africa, in response to the call of the Jesuits to collaborate with INADES (African Institute for Economic and Social Development, now CERAP). Other foundings followed: in Korhogo, also in Ivory Coast, in 1972; in N'Djamena, Chad, in 1983; in Abobo, Abidjan, in 2002; in Yaound√© in 2006. The last foundation was in 2012. In July 2017, Sister Christine Danel became the Superior General of Congregation. In May 2019 Pope Francis named Xaviere Sister Nathalie Becquart along with two other women as consultors for the General Secretariat for the Synod of Bishops on Young People, Faith, and Vocational Discernment, marking a historic first for the Church. She had earlier served as the Director of the National Service for Youth Evangelization and Vocations in France, and was the first woman to hold that position. Whether they are secretaries, youth leaders, doctors, engineers, librarians, theologians, teachers, chaplaincy leaders, psychologists, nurses, managers; whether they work in a company or provide school support, the Xaviere live in small communities, close to people's homes and workplace. The Xaviere number about one hundred. They are spread over twenty communities on three continents: Africa, Europe and America.

Jewish tradition states that Ezra is the author of Ezra-Nehemiah as well as the Book of Chronicles,Babylonian Talmud Baba Bathra 15a, apud Fensham 1982, p. 2 but modern scholars generally accept that a compiler from the 5th century BCE (the so-called \\"Chronicler\\") is the final author of these books. The section comprising chapters 7 to 10 mainly describes the activities of Ezra the scribe and the priest. This chapter and the next deal with the problem of intermarriage, starting with the introduction of the crisis, then Ezra‚Äôs public mourning and prayer of shame. J. Gordon McConville suggests that this chapter is central to the Book of Ezra because it draws a sharp contrast between what the people of God ought to be and what they actually are. Text This chapter is divided into 15 verses. The original text of this chapter is in Hebrew language.Note i on Ezra 7:27 in the New King James Version: \\"The Hebrew language resumes in Ezra 7:27.\\" =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century; only Ezra 9:9 to end), Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). An ancient Greek book called 1 Esdras (Greek: ) containing some parts of 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah is included in most editions of the Septuagint and is placed before the single book of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah (which is titled in Greek: ). 1 Esdras 8:68-90 is an equivalent of Ezra 9 (Repentance from mixed marriages).Catholic Encyclopedia: Esdras: THE BOOKS OF ESDRAS: III EsdrasJewish Encyclopedia: Esdras, Books of: I Esdras The report (9:1‚Äì2) Some Jewish leaders in Jerusalem reported to Ezra about 'the misconduct of various leaders and members of the community'. =Verse 2= : \\"For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed is mixed with the peoples of those lands. Indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this trespass.\\" NKJV * \\"The peoples of those lands\\": are associated with 'Hebrew Text Analysis: Ezra 9:1. Biblehub (\\"abominations\\"), which is \\"the most common cultic term for idolatrous practices\\", and also denoting the \\"objectionable actions and behavior\\". Verse 1 lists the origins of the mixed marriage partners as Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites. NKJV The response (9:3‚Äì5) Hearing the report, Ezra responded with a \\"public act of contrition\\" in his function as \\"the official representative of the community\\". =Verse 3= :And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. KJV *\\"Rent my garment and my mantle\\": Here Ezra is rending (tearing) his 'under-garment' or 'tunic' (Hebrew ') and the 'long loose robe' (Hebrew: ') that he was wearing. The act of rending one's clothes is frequently mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as a sign of grief, such as: * Reuben rent his 'clothes' (plural of ') on not finding Joseph () * Jacob rent his 'garments' (plural of ') on seeing Joseph's blood-stained coat () * Joseph's brethren rent their clothers (plural of ') when the cup was found in Benjamin's sack () * Joshua rent his 'clothes' (plural of ') after the repulse at Ai () * Jephthah rent his 'clothes' (plural of ') on meeting his daughter () * the messenger from the field of Ziklag came with his clothes (plural of ') rent (, cf. ) * Job rent his mantle (') on hearing of his children's death () * Job's friends rent their mantle (‚Äò‚Äô) when they came to visit him (). The action also denoted 'horror' on receiving shocking intelligence or hearing shocking words, such as: * Hezekiah and his ministers rent their clothes (plural of ') after Rabshakeh's speech (; ) *Mordecai rent his clothes (plural of ') on hearing of Haman's determination () * See also ; ; . In the New Testament is also recorded: * the High-priest rent his garments on hearing the testimony of Jesus ().Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges. Ezra 9. Accessed 28 April 2019.

It introduces the character of Laurie Blake (Jean Smart), formerly the vigilante Silk Spectre but now a member of the FBI's Anti-Vigilante's Task Force. Synopsis Laurie Blake - formerly the second Silk Spectre but now a member of the FBI Anti- Vigilante Task Force - is instructed by Senator Joe Keene Jr. and the FBI to investigate the situation in Tulsa. Instead of a large team, she opts to only bring Dale Petey, a novice agent who is well-versed in the history of the Minutemen. On arrival, Laurie finds the police are preparing for Judd's funeral and concerned that a full investigation of Judd's death was not completed. Laurie and Dale meet Angela before the funeral, and Laurie offers to talk to Angela over coffee later. At the funeral, a Seventh Kavalry member wearing a bomb vest with a killswitch based on his heartbeat emerges from a nearby tomb and seizes Senator Keene. Laurie uses a hidden gun to kill the hostage taker, and Angela drags his body into Judd's grave and pushes the casket atop it, smothering the explosion. Police investigate the tomb. Laurie comes by with coffee as Angela explores the origin of the tunnel used by the Kavalry. Laurie makes it clear to Angela that she knows there are many questions around Judd's death, including the empty space in his closet where something had been hung and the wheelchair tracks near the tree Judd was lynched from. Angela remains cold to Laurie's warnings, pouring out the offered coffee. That night, Laurie pulls a large blue vibrator from her luggage, but after a moment, goes to sleep with Dale instead. Later, Laurie uses a special phone booth to leave a recorded message for Doctor Manhattan on Mars. She tells Manhattan a \\"brick joke\\" incontestably about her former allies Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, and Ozymandias, shown in pieces throughout the episode. Exiting the booth, Laurie is nearly hit by Angela's car falling out of the sky. Laurie looks up to see Mars in the night sky, and lets out a laugh. The Lord of the Country Manor unsuccessfully tests a survival suit made from pieces around the castle with one of the Phillips clones. The Lord asserts he needs stronger material and attempts to hunt bison, but the Game Warden appears on a hillside to warn him off. The Lord issues a defiant response to a written warning from the Game Warden about his imprisonment and signs it \\"Adrian Veidt\\". He prepares to return to hunt in his Ozymandias costume. Production This episode introduces the character of Laurie Blake portrayed by Jean Smart, who received positive reviews for her performance. \\"She Was Killed by Space Junk\\" is focused on the character of Laurie Blake previously known as the second Silk Spectre, played by Jean Smart. Showrunner Damon Lindelof said that of the main characters from the limited series, Laurie's was left unfinished: in the aftermath of the squid attack on New York City, Laurie joins up with Daniel Dreiberg, the Nite Owl, to return to vigilantism despite it being outlawed, and considering if she will become like her father, Edward Blake known as The Comedian. Lindelof had to consider what would likely happen to Laurie in the thirty-years' time between the limited series and the movie: one idea he came up with was that Laurie had experienced how to be a vigilante in her mother's footsteps during the events of the limited series, so in the years after, she would try to see what is was like to do the same in her father's. From those combined experiences, Lindelof felt Laurie would come to see vigilantism as troublesome, and thus why she joined the FBI's Anti-Vigilante Task Force. As such, Laurie was written as a very defensive character, trusting few others and rarely showing feelings or talking about her past, having closed up on that period of her life. Lila Byock wrote Blake's scenes so that her level of agency would contrast with the younger Silk Spectre character in the limited series. She also explained that the vibrator scene was pitched as a joke until Lindelof responded approvingly. The Haliburton briefcase Blake uses to transport it has elicited comparisons to Pulp Fiction. Lindelof likened Laurie's character to that of Sigourney Weaver in Working Girl, and had considered Smart as an actor that could play a similar role. Smart had not read the limited series before hearing about the role, but signed on as she considered Laurie an interesting character with \\"all sorts of baggage\\" from her past. The episode also affirmed that Jeremy Irons played Adrian Veidt, previously the vigilante Ozymandias. Up until this episode, HBO had listed Irons' role as \\"A Lord of a Country Manor\\", though following the premiere, many television critics and viewers guessed Irons was playing Veidt. Damon Lindelof considered Veidt's return essential for the show, as Veidt was Lindelof's favorite character from the book and who raised a number of \\"contradictory feelings\\" when considering how to write for him. Lindelof said that while Veidt within the limited series was nearly in full control of every action, he wanted to write Veidt in a situation where events were out of his control. Irons said he was drawn to play the character after hearing a summary of Veidt's story from the original limited series and the ideas he had for Veidt in the television show, calling the character an \\"enigma\\" and that the proposed role \\"was fascinating, off-the-wall, bizarre and thoroughly mesmeric to play\\". The opening of the show features Laurie Blake leading a faked bank robbery to capture the vigilante Mister Shadow, played by Lee Tergesen. Mister Shadow was written as a parody of Batman. Costume designer Meghan Kasperlik drew out a Batman-like outfit which had included high-tech gadgetry, which became part of Mister Shadow's character as a rich person with too much money using it for crime-fighting. The costume was fabricated with help of one of the local Atlanta fabricators that had previously done work on the various Marvel Cinematic Universe films. The episode's exact title is a line taken from the lyrics of \\"Space Junk\\" from the Devo album Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!, which Laurie is shown listening to when Senator Keene arrives. Reception =Critical= On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 8.82 out of 10, based on 31 reviews. The site's summary states \\"Not only does Jean Smart's brilliant performance as the former vigilante turned FBI agent Laurie Blake raise the stakes, but her arrival in Tulsa connects \\"She Was Killed by Space Junk\\" to its comic book past in an exciting way.\\" =Ratings= The episode had an estimate 648,000 viewers on the first night of broadcast.

She is a professor of comparative literature at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the former president of the Celtic Studies Association of North America. She is known for her calls for a more international and multicultural perspective on translation. Education and career Tymoczko is of Slovak descent through her grandmother, and grew up speaking English, Slovak, and (from neighbors) Italian. She lived in her grandmother's house in Cleveland, Ohio at a time and place where \\"it was assumed that most people spoke at least two languages\\", and has stated that this upbringing strongly influenced her view of translation. She earned a bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College in 1965, majoring in Romance languages with a minor in biochemistry. After a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Aix-Marseille University, she returned to Harvard University for graduate study, earning a master's degree in 1968 and completing her Ph.D. in Celtic and Romance languages and literatures in 1973. Her dissertation, The Personal Names in the Ulster Sagas: A Tool for Understanding the Development of the Cycle, was supervised by John V. Kelleher. After postdoctoral research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, she became an assistant professor of Irish studies for the Five College Consortium in 1974, and in 1977 moved to the comparative literature department of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the Five Colleges. Books Tymoczko's first book, The Irish \\"Ulysses\\" (University of California Press, 1994) was co-winner of the 1995 Book Award for Literary and Cultural Criticism from the American Conference for Irish Studies. The book argues that in Ulysses, James Joyce was seeking to create an Irish literature, and teases out many parallel passages from Ulysses to the Irish literary tradition that, according to Tymoczko, were deliberate references by Joyce. calls some of the comparisons stretched and suggests that many readers will not be convinced, but still calls it \\"a book that every Joycean must read\\". And although criticizes her style of reasoning, \\"from like to like\\", as being weak without a comparison of how many other things are also like, he nevertheless says that she \\"establishes [it] beyond any quibble\\". supports her thesis as unsurprising, pointing to Joyce's later use of Irish texts in Finnegans Wake. Her next book forms a bridge between this early work on Irish literature and her later work on translation as a general topic. Translation in a Postcolonial Context (St. Jerome Publishing, 1999) was winner of the Michael J. Durkan Prize of the American Conference for Irish Studies for best book in Irish language and cultural studies. It studies multiple 19th- and 20th-century translations of old Irish literature, particularly concentrating on the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge, and the ways in which these translations were colored by the context of the colonization and decolonization of Ireland. It also expresses a clear preference for literary translation over scholarly translation, as would later be exemplified by Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf. It is in her third book, Enlarging Translation, Empowering Translators (St. Jerome Publishing, 2007), that Tymocko clearly articulates her call for a new view of translation bringing greater diversity into its theory and practice. She argues that the view of translation as faithfully transmitting the original meaning of a text is only one way of looking at translation, stemming from its origin in the translation of the bible. Instead, following Gideon Toury, she argues that any text viewed within its culture as being a translation should be considered as one, that there are many types of translation, that the boundaries of what makes a translation are fuzzy and dynamic, and that viewing translation in this way can help bring a diverse and international viewpoint to the subject.

Jewish tradition states that Ezra is the author of Ezra- Nehemiah as well as the Book of Chronicles,Babylonian Talmud Baba Bathra 15a, apud Fensham 1982, p. 2 but modern scholars generally accept that a compiler from the 5th century BCE (the so-called \\"Chronicler\\") is the final author of these books. The section comprising chapters 7 to 10 mainly describes the activities of Ezra the scribe and the priest. This chapter and the previous one deal with the problem of intermarriage, especially the solution of it, ending with a list of those who sent away their \\"foreign\\" wives and children; a somber note which finds relief in the Book of Nehemiah, as the continuation of the Book of Ezra.

This chapter is divided into 44 verses. The original text of this chapter is in Hebrew language.Note i on Ezra 7:27 in NKJV: \\"The Hebrew language resumes in Ezra 7:27.\\" =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century). An ancient Greek book called 1 Esdras (Greek: ) containing some parts of 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah is included in most editions of the Septuagint and is placed before the single book of Ezra‚ÄìNehemiah (which is titled in Greek: ). 1 Esdras 8:91-9:36 is an equivalent of Ezra 10 (Putting away of foreign wives and children).Catholic Encyclopedia: Esdras: THE BOOKS OF ESDRAS: III EsdrasJewish Encyclopedia: Esdras, Books of: I Esdras The consensus (10:1‚Äì6) Ezra's public humiliation and prayer attracted a group of people who joined him in 'demonstrations of sorrow over the sins of Israel', and as a result, they made a consensus of the resolution. =Verse 1= :Now while Ezra was praying, and while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down before the house of God, a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him from Israel; for the people wept very bitterly. The Hebrew shows that the people were assembling during Ezra‚Äôs prayer.Ryle, H. E. (1901), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ezra 10, accessed 28 June 2020 The Jerusalem Bible describes the prayer of Ezra as \\"also a sermon\\".Jerusalem Bible (1966), note d at Ezra 9:6 =Verse 2= :And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, ‚ÄúWe have trespassed against our God, and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this. The people acknowledged that that been unfaithful to God,Note a at Ezra 10:2 in the New King James Version in breach of the law. The laws to which Ezra must have referred would have been those found in , and . These passages contain prohibitions, very similar in character, directed against intermarriage with the nations that dwelt in Canaan, on the ground that such marriages would inevitably lead to idolatry and to the abominations connected with idolatrous worship. =Verse 5= :Then Ezra arose, and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear an oath that they would do according to this word. So they swore an oath. NKJV Although Ezra has been given Persian authority, his choice of action to make the leaders, priests, Levites, and all Israel \\"swear an oath\\" to abide by a covenantal agreement reflects \\"internal politics\\", in contrast to Nehemiah, who prefers 'to command and order'. The assembly (10:7‚Äì15) The whole community was assembled \\"in the street of the house of God\\" : King James Version to \\"confront the intermarriage issue and to decide on the divorce proposal\\". The commission (10:16‚Äì17) Following the majority opinion, Ezra appointed a commission by selecting 'men who were family heads' to form the official investigation of the intermarriage cases. The guilty (10:18‚Äì44) After the results of the commission's investigation were announced, an official list was created to record 'those found guilty of marrying pagan women.

It has received regular airplay on AOR stations since its release in 1972. It, like the album it's on, is based on The Book of Revelation. Background 666 was created as a concept album, telling the story of Revelation, the Apocalypse of John.Aphrodite's Child ‚Äì The Four Horsemen That book of the Bible that was an attack on the tyranny of the Roman empire at it was written, and the album goes through a number of famous passages and themes, including the Whore of Babylon (Rome), The Beast (Nero), and in this case the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The song's lyrics mostly paraphrasing the text of Revelation 6. The song's structure is marked by a dynamic contrast, with Roussos singing over an echoed keyboard drone and wind chimes in the verses, and the chorus containing traditional rock instrumentation highlighted by Sideras' drumming. The song culminates in a two-minute wah guitar solo by Koulouris over heavy drumming by Sideras and a repeated \\"fa fa fa\\" background chant by Roussos. In the song, as in , \\"The Lamb\\" is presented with a sealed scroll. This lamb is often taken to mean Jesus (who was referred to as The Lamb of God who will take away the sin of the world\\" in ). But this lamb has \\"seven horns and seven eyes\\", and may represent seven Christian groups in the Roman world, oppressed by Nero's tyranny, to whom John is instructed in visions to send the book. The scroll may, indeed, represent the Book of Revelation, itself. Either way, the Lamb begins opening the scroll in both the book and the song. It has seven seals, and as each of the first four is opened, it releases some crisis represented by a horseman. These horsemen are described in part, by the color of their horses, especially in the song: Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, an 1887 painting by Victor Vasnetsov. The Lamb is visible at the top. The leading horse is white The second horse is red The third one is a black The last one is a greenThe Four Horsemen ‚Äî Genius The first horseman holds a bow, and is said to represent either Plague or evangelism of the Gospels. But more specifically it seems to historically refer to Nero, who expelled the author from Rome and plays the role of the Beast in Revelation. The sword-wielding second horseman may represent war, or genocide. \\"Red\\" is a legitimate horse color, a reddish brown. The third horseman, mounted on black, is famine, which carries a balance because this is how grain was handed out when food was scarce: The fourth horse is described using a word \\"khloros\\", which probably should be translated from the original greek as \\"pale\\". But the Greek-speaking songwriters make a pun here, another meaning of khloros being \\"green\\", the origin of the word chlorophyll. The fourth horseman is explicitly named Thanatos, meaning \\"death\\" in Greek, the same word from which Thanos got his name in the Marvel universe. Impact Receiving significant airplay on album-oriented radio, the song went on to be covered or sampled by a number of bands.The Four Horsemen ‚Äî Whosampled \\"The Four Horsemen\\" influenced Beck's \\"Chemtrails\\", which has a similar structure, and The Verve's \\"The Rolling People\\", which quoted the \\"fa fa fa\\" chant. The chorus was also sampled, in a slowed-down fashion, on Daniel Lopatin's \\"A7\\", from Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1. The song is very popular among metal and techno acts, forming a significant list of covers and samplings. =Covers= *In 2001, the german Heavy Metal band Axxis included a cover on their album Eyes Of Darkness. *In 2004, Gregorian released a cover of \\"The Four Horsemen\\" on their album The Dark Side. *In 2005, German dance group Scooter released a Techno version of \\"The Four Horsemen\\" called The Leading Horse on their album Who's Got The Last Laugh Now?. *In 2015, the Greek band Cyanna Mercury (formerly known as Cyanna) covered \\"The Four Horsemen\\" on the Death Roots Syndicate compilation The End. *\\"The Four Horsemen\\" has proven an especially popular cover among European heavy metal bands. Bands that have covered the song include the Italian band Death SS (on their 2006 album The 7th Seal), the Swedish doom metal band Grifteg√•rd (on an EP released through V√°n Records in 2015), and the Greek black metal band Rotting Christ (on their 2016 album Rituals). =Samples= *The Verve's song \\"The Rolling People\\" (from their 1997 album Urban Hymns) borrows its title from \\"Altamont\\", while also containing musical elements of \\"The Four Horsemen\\". Frontman Richard Ashcroft reportedly mentioned 666 as a strong influence on his music. *Beck's song \\"Chemtrails\\" (from his 2008 album Modern Guilt) also resembles \\"The Four Horsemen\\". * Oneohtrix Point Never used a sample on his track \\"Untitled A7\\". * Scooter used a sample in their song \\"The Leading Horse\\". * Gregorian sampled it in their own \\"The Four Horsemen\\".

Early life and career  The son of Dirk Willebrandts and Sara Bongers, Dick Willebrandts was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He married Maria Margaretha Lucas on 9 October 1935. In 1925 Dick Willebrandts started his career as a pianist in the sextet set up by his brother Philip Willebrandts, for whom he wrote several arrangements. Around 1928 Willebrandts became a member of German and Danish big bands who performed in the Netherlands. Between 1935 and 1937 Willebrandts was a pianist with ‚ÄúThe Internationals‚Äù, a big band formed by Jack de Vries (1906-1976) and his brother the jazz trumpeter Louis de Vries (1905-1935). Louis died in a car crash in 1935.Dutch Jazz Archive, The Story of Dutch Jazz: Jazz Heroes.Wim van Eyle, Louis de Vries, The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz, 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld, 1988. From 1937 to 1940 Willebrandts was employed by the Dutch broadcaster AVRO as a pianist with the AVRO Dance Orchestra, the band leader of which was Hans Mossel. Willebrandts also wrote arrangements for the AVRO Dance Orchestra.  World War II  When Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the AVRO Dance Orchestra was forced to disband. Willebrandts continued to perform for the Dutch radio from 1940 to 1942. In 1942 he found a sponsor who helped him to form a big band: Dick Willebrandts and His Dance Orchestra. Recordings were made by Decca Records, the label that also sponsored his concert tours in the Netherlands. As the war continued the big bands had to commit to a special repertoire in order to be allowed to perform before an audience. Each big band had to be a member of the ‚ÄúNederlandsche Kultuurkamer‚Äù, the Dutch equivalent of the German Reich Chamber of Culture, a government agency in Nazi Germany that was extended to the occupied territories. A rejected inscription resulted in an occupational ban. The ‚ÄúNederlandsche Kultuurkamer‚Äù played an important role in the Nazi oppression of modern art and music that was considered \\"degenerate art\\", such as American jazz and swing music. This supposedly \\"degenerate music\\" was much more popular with the public than the Nazis thought. Advertisement in the Algemeen Handelsblad, 5 June 1943, announcing a concert on 6 June 1943. Among the members of Willebrandts' big band were Wim Kroon (bass), Aldert Dekker (drums), Bep Rowold, Cees Verschoor, Tinus and Kees Bruyn (saxophone), Tony van Hulst (guitar), Kees van Dorsser, Francis Bay en Frans van der Meer (brass instruments). Willebrandts himself played the piano. Trombonist, composer and arranger Pi Scheffer played the trombone in Willebrandts‚Äô big band.Keeping Swinging. Dick Willebrandts and his band blended jazz and entertainment.The Dutch Jazz Archive. The vocalists were Jan de Vries and Nelly Verschuur. During World War II Nelly Verschuur was very successful, especially with two songs both written by Jaap Valkhoff: ‚ÄúDiep in mijn hart‚Äù (‚ÄúDeep in My Heart‚Äù) (1943) and ‚ÄúDenk je nog aan die tijd' (‚ÄúDo You Remember Those Days‚Äù) (1943). Both songs were recorded between August and December 1943 in Hilversum for the Deutsche Europasender (D.E.S.) in Studio B of the Dutch Broadcasting Corporation. Nelly Verschuur also sang the English version ‚ÄúDeep in my Heart‚Äù. Dick Willebrandts‚Äô big band often performed for the by the Nazis controlled Dutch radio. From August 1943 until September 1944 several recordings were made for propaganda purposes which were broadcast via the broadcaster Calais II, the new name of the Dutch radio station Hilversum II. Dick Willebrandts was \\"dienstverpflichtet\\" by the German occupiers to work for the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft. It was agreed upon with the sixteen members of his orchestra that Dick Willebrandts and his orchestra would continue to play because they all had families to support. Calais II was part of the German Europasender during the Nazi regime, and the counterpart of the British black propaganda broadcaster Soldatensender Calais. After Mad Tuesday, September 5, 1944, the situation changed dramatically. Broadcasts had alleged that Breda had been liberated which caused rumours that the liberation of the occupied Netherlands by the Allied forces was at hand. Dick Willebrandts' big band was disbanded. Some musicians were arrested, others had to go in hiding, like Willebrandts himself. Dick Willebrandts gave financial help and shelter to two Jewish families in his family home in Rotterdam and in Hilversum so as to avoid their deportation during the Holocaust years.Nationaal Archief, The Hague: Research in 1946 based on two letters dated August 1946 and 28 August 1946 by Holocaust survivors.  Later career  Nazi Germany was defeated between 4 and 8 May 1945 during which the remaining German armed forces surrendered unconditionally. This resulted in the liberation of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. Now life became briefly difficult for Dick Willebrandts. Just like Theo Uden Masman, another famous Dutch big band leader of The Ramblers, who had equally played for the Germans during the occupation, Willebrandts was not allowed to lead a big band for a period of six months. During this time Willebrandts worked as a pianist in a bar in his home town of Rotterdam. In 1947 Willebrandts was re-employed by the AVRO and in 1955 he once again became a band leader of an orchestra and a dixieland band.Music Encyclopedia, Dick Willebrandts. In 1960 the trombonist and band leader Pi Scheffer asked Willebrandts to join the radio orchestra, the ‚ÄúOK Wobblers‚Äù. To honour Willebrandts the record label Grannyphone published in 1989 a cd ‚ÄúDick Willebrandts and his Radio-Orchestra‚Äù with previously unrecorded numbers which Willebrandts had played for the Deutsche Europasender (D.E.S.) in 1943. This cd was rewarded with an Edison Award, an annual Dutch music award for outstanding achievements in the music industry.  Retirement and death  In 1963 Dick Willebrandts had a heart attack of which he recovered, yet it ended his career. He died on 29 December 1970 as the result of a fatal heart attack.Leeuwarder Courant, 31-12-1970.

Russia was the first western country that ninja confronted and among the earliest countries that recognized the existence of ninja and researched them.  Under isolation of Japan  In Hirosaki Domain, there was a group of ninja troops named Hayamichi no mono (Êó©ÈÅì‰πãËÄÖ) which it was established from the 17th century to 1872. Originally established by Sugiyama Yoshinari (ÊùâÂ±±ÂêâÊàê), the grandson of Ishida Mitsunari and the K≈çga ninja Nakagawa Kohayato (‰∏≠Â∑ùÂ∞èÈöº‰∫∫), they dealt with Ainu issues such as Shakushain's revolt. When Russian ships began to come to Ezo, Hayamichi no mono was mobilized for guarding. In Bakumatsu era, about 60 ninjas served Hirosaki Domain as Hayamichi no mono.„ÄÇ In 1807 Nikolai Rezanov ordered his subordinate Nikolai Khvostov to attack Ezo. During this battle Hirayama Gyozo, descendant of Iga ninja suggested to the Shogunate to send troops consisting of criminals similar to the ninja troops. However, this plan was never executed.  Ninja research in Russia  In the early 20th century, some research about ninja developed. Roman Kim, the Koryo-saram born in Vladivostok went to Japan to study at 7 years old. After returning to Russia he became an instructor in Japanese language and history of far east of Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies. He gave a detailed account of ninja and ninjutsu in the annotation of \\"The Roots of the Japanese Sun\\" (1927) by Boris Pilnyak. This was the first study of ninja in Russia and one of the earliest foreign researchers of Ninja. Until the 1930s, Kim ordered sources from Japan and planned to complete a new paper about ninja. Actually, Kim himself was a spy of the Soviet Union. In 1937 he stole a confidential document from the Japanese Embassy and received Order of the Red Star. However he was arrested as Japanese spy in the same year, and engaged in the translation of Japanese confidential documents in prison till the end of WW‚Ö°. A new paper about ninja was never finished. After the war, he became an author of spy fiction including a novel about ninja.„É≠„Éû„É≥„Éª„Ç≠„É†ÂõΩÈöõ‰ºöË≠∞Â†±ÂëäË®ò„ÄÅÂùÇ‰∏≠Á¥ÄÂ§´„ÄÅÊó•Êú¨„É≠„Ç∑„Ç¢ÊñáÂ≠¶‰ºö  Anti-Soviet activity by Ninjutsu Practitioners  Seiko Fujita, 14th Headmaster or Soke of K≈çga-ry≈´ taught arts such as Ninjutsu,Taijutsu in Nakano School.

Solidarity Network with Migrants Japan was founded in 1997 by 66 migrant support groups and 72 individuals, who started to meet on a regular basis at the ‚Äúnationwide forum for solidarity with migrant workers‚Äù (ij≈´ r≈çd≈çsha to rentai suru zenkoku f≈çramu) in 1996. Since June 2015 SMJ is legally incorporated as Non-Profit Organization (NPO) under the Japanese NPO-law. Among the SMJ‚Äôs members are organizations as well as individuals. The SMJ‚Äôs office is located in Bunky≈ç ward, Tokyo. The largest part of its revenue comes from membership fees and subscriptions.  Activities  SMJ describes its activities as advocacy, networking, and publicity. Authors observed the organizations‚Äô potential for deliberative democracy and global citizenship education. = Publications = SMJ publishes the monthly Japanese language magazine Migrants Network. One issue costs 500 Yen and can be purchased via subscription. The SMJ has also edited several non-fiction books on different migration issues. Most of them have been published by Akashi Shoten, a publisher in Tokyo specializing in education, social and minority issues in Japan. = Policy demands = In 2002 the SMJ demanded wide-ranging reforms of foreigner policies in Japan. As the SMJ‚Äôs proposal touched all aspects of migration and foreigners living in Japan, it has been one of the most encompassing in Japan so far. In ten chapters it recommended policy revisions that concerned the rights of foreigners as workers, women‚Äôs rights, education and citizenship of children, the role of the local self-government, the treatment of asylum seekers, the rights of foreigners in court and proclaimed the aim of ending racism and xenophobia in Japan. A central demand of SMJ is abolishing the Technical Intern Training Program and creating a visa category for foreign nationals finding employment in Japan without restriction on skills and educational attainment. Further legal changes proposed by SMJ include the introduction of a basic law on the human rights of foreigners, a law that prohibits discrimination based on race and ethnicity, a constitutional reform that guarantees more basic rights to foreigners, a separation of the law on immigration and refugee recognition and abolishing of the Alien Registration Act. It also urged the Japanese government to completely ratify all international human rights conventions, as well as to withdraw its reservations concerning the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). = Advocacy = The SMJ has no formal ties to political parties in Japan. In July 2008, the former Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which was in power from August 2009 to December 2012, published a report on foreign workers policies. Besides other institutions and interest groups, the DPJ‚Äôs committee also invited SMJ representatives as external advisors during the drafting process. Since its establishment in 1997, SMJ and its partner organizations regularly met with bureaucrats from several ministries at least twice a year in March and November, and SMJ members have appeared as external councilors in parliamentary commissions of the National Diet in 2003, 2004 and twice in 2009.  In the media  SMJ regularly serves as information sources for journalists reporting on migration issues in Japan. Ippei Torii, the secretary general of SMJ, appeared in the 2009 documentary movie \\"Sour Strawberries ‚Äì Japan‚Äôs Hidden Guest Workers\\". On 17 September 2019 the Japanese public broadcaster NHK aired a 40 minutes feature on Torii.  International recognition  When in 2010 the UN Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, visited Japan he also met with SMJ. As a result, Bustamante‚Äôs report widely adopted SMJ‚Äôs view on the Technical Intern Training Program stating that \\"situations amount to slavery or trafficking,\\" and that since there was > \\"no effective system [...] in place to monitor the situation of trainees and > technical interns and offer them protection and referral mechanisms, they > remained particularly vulnerable and became victims of serious abuses\\". In July 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry awarded Ippei Torii with the title of \\"TIP Report Hero,\\" for being > \\"a forceful leader in anti-trafficking efforts as the secretary general for > Solidarity Network with Migrants Japan (SMJ), which has provided shelter and > assistance to more than 4,000 foreign workers in Japan who have escaped from > exploitative conditions or sought help recovering unpaid wages.

It is on Granada's south-western coast, 70 kilometres east of M√°laga.  History  La Herradura's first settlers have been dated to prehistoric times. In the 19th century, in El Pago de la Mezquita, several tombs with remains of bronze weapons were found and in 1950, in El Sapo, there was another discovery with similar characteristics, but better documented, dated to the 15th century BCE. There are vestiges of habitation from Roman times, in places such as in the country house de la Argentina, in the ravine of Las Tejas, and in the construction of the old road M√°laga-Almer√≠a. There are also the remains of a hermitage or rural mausoleum from the sixth century AD, of Byzantine design, in the upper course of the river Jate. More information is available from the Islamic period and it is also known the existence of a farmhouse called \\"S√§t\\" or \\"Xat\\". It is known that Abd al-Rahman I arrived to La Herradura in 755 from Damascus, prior to the foundation of the Califato de C√≥rdoba. Numerous details are known about this period, such as the fact that it was the scene of a battle in the Muwallad revolt in the 9th century. The raisins exported from the area were considered the best in the Islamic world at this time. The watchtower of Punta de la Mona, restored in the 18th century and now serving as the base for a lighthouse, dates from the Nasrid period. It was part of a chain of watchtowers running along the coast that were rebuilt in the late 16th century to guard against corsairs. Cerro Gordo has a similar 10.5-meter- high tower that was part of this warning system, using smoke signals during the day and fire at night. In 1764, Charles III of Spain ordered the construction of nine fortresses along this coast and La Herradura castle was finished in 1768. This defensive system of forts and towers was reinforced before the Peninsular War. French forces later took La Herradura castle before guerilla soldiers under the Mayor of Otivar recaptured it. It served as the barracks of the Carabineros and then the Civil Guard before becoming a cultural centre, used for concerts and similar events. Originally on the seafront, the castle now stands well back from the shore because of sea-level changes. On 19 October, 1562, 25 Spanish galley warships from a fleet of 28 sank in La Herradura Bay in the La Herradura naval disaster, with the loss of up to 5,000 of those aboard.https://hdnh.es/el-desastre-naval-de-la-herradura/  El desastre naval de La Herradura A monument on La Herradura‚Äôs seafront commemorates the tragedy. Erected in 1990, it is by Granada-based sculptor Miguel Moreno. In the 19th century, several families of Italian fishermen settled in La Herradura. Two of these families were the ancestors of the current Barbero and Garciolo families. During the 20th century the rapid growth in tourism experienced throughout Spain caused major changes in La Herradura. In modern times, there has been a call by a small group for separation from the municipality of Almu√±√©car, without any success to date.  Geography  La Herradura is on the Spanish shore of the Mediterranean, standing on the horseshoe-shaped bay from which it takes its name (\\"La herradura\\" is Spanish for horseshoe). Its two-kilometre-long sand and pebble beach is divided into several parts by rocky promontories and a river outlet. An unusual feature of Playa La Herradura is its stands of palm trees. Behind the beach is the main street, Paseo Andr√©s Segovia, lined with caf√©s, restaurants, bars, shops and apartments. The older town of La Herradura was built with typical whitewashed Andalucian houses on the steep sides of a wadi of the same name running down to the eastern side of the beach. As the settlement has grown from a fishing village into a tourist resort, more modern developments have spread along both sides of the bay and into the surrounding hills. It is the most western coastal urban area of the province of Granada and borders the town of Maro, in the district of Nerja. Inland is the Sierra de la Almijara, popular for hiking. La Herradura is the only coastal town in Granada with an indigenous nature reserve. The Maro Cerro Gordo Cliffs Reserve is a small area of natural vegetation and unspoilt fauna between Cerro Gordo, the headland at the western end of La Herradura Bay, and Maro. Both the land and the seabed, which preserves corals and endangered species, were declared a Natural Site in the 1980s by the Autonomous Government. The flora includes Mediterranean pines, carob, juniper, boxwood, olive and palm trees, while the fauna is most notable for numbers of wild mountain goats (Iberian Ibex). There are various coastal hiking trails of varying lengths and difficulty. The reserve is a major attraction for La Herradura‚Äôs many diving centres and also draws large numbers of kayakers in summer.https://andaluciabirdsociety.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/10/pdf-files_Maro-Cerro-Gordo-Cliffs.pdf The eastern headland of Punta de la Mona separates the town from the marina of Punta de la Mona, formerly called Marina del Este, the beach of Los Berengueles and the naturist beach of El Muerto which borders Cotobro ravine. To the west of Cerro Gordo is the naturist beach of Cantarrij√°n, which borders the province of M√°laga. = Limits = La Herradura is bordered to the north by the municipality of Ot√≠var, to the east by the ravine of Cotobro and the town of Almu√±ecar, to the south by the Mediterranean Sea and to the west by the ravine of Cantarrij√°n and the municipality of Nerja.  Demography  According to the Spanish National Statistical Institute, in 2012 La Herradura had 4,248 inhabitants.  Culture  = Celebrations = Saint Joseph (San Jos√© [sa≈ã xoÀàse] in Spanish), the town‚Äôs patron saint, is honoured every year with a fair and other events around 19 March. Fiesta de las Cruces (Day of the Cross), or Cruz de Mayo (May Cross), is celebrated from 1 to 3 May. The night of San Juan from 23 to 24 June sees bonfires lit on the beach. At midnight, people wash their eyes in the sea, for good luck throughout the year. Traditionally, this marked the first bathe in the sea of the summer season. Holy Week with a unique brotherhood that has as headlines all the images that come out during Holy Week and San Jos√© and the Virgen del Carmen (Brotherhood of La Herradura). La Virgen del Carmen, patron saint of fishermen and sailors, is celebrated on 16 July. A flower-covered effigy of the Virgin Mary ‚Äì Stella Maris, \\"Queen of the Sea‚Äù ‚Äì is paraded through the streets and taken out to sea in a flotilla of fishing boats, with a firework display at night. Traditionally, the sea is not considered safe enough to swim in until after it has been blessed on this date. Dawn Rosary takes place in the early hours of 21 to 24 December, a tradition that dates back to the end of the 19th century. An image of the Virgin Mary On a banner, flanked by two lanterns, is carried through the streets of the town. The parade is accompanied by musicians with string instruments, bells and triangle and singers praising the Virgin. The parade ends with a mass, and typical Andalucian carols.  Eminent personalities  Jes√∫s Espigares Mira, president of Interpol between 2000 and 2004, was born in La Herradura in 1946. He was the first Spaniard and first Spanish speaker to run the institution.https://www.interpol.int/en/Who-we- are/Governance/President/Former-Presidents  References  Category:Almu√±√©car Category:Towns in Spain ","title":"La Herradura"},{"id":"62246594","text":"The Speedway Grand Prix of Russia is a speedway event that is a part of the Speedway Grand Prix Series.

He did not stay there long, and before reaching mastery, which he will accomplish after his return to Mechelen, he went to England where, following the London fire and his rebuilding, there was a strong demand in the crafts.

(C.) v. K. (J.) [2004 IESC 21; [2004] 1 IR 224], is an Irish Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the doctrine of estoppel (where the court can prevent someone going back on his/her word) could not be used to change the status of a person, when the status, as a matter of law, never actually changed.  Background  The respondent had previously been married. This marriage had failed and the respondent sought to secure a divorce against it. He was assured by an attorney he met socially that a divorce could be secured for him without any difficulty, despite the absence of certain required legal requirements of residency among other matters. Documents had been prepared based on incorrect information regarding the address of residence referring to Ohio. The respondent then travelled to Ohio to attend the divorce hearing and the divorce had subsequently been secured. In 1983, the appellant and respondent were married at the Registry Office in Dublin. The application of registry was on the basis the respondent was a bachelor. There had been no reservation or impediment noted during the marriage ceremony. When the appellant's and respondent's relationship broke down in 2001, the appellant sought a decree of judicial separation in the Circuit Court. In response to this, the respondent, filed his counter claim, seeking a declaration pursuant to s29(1) of the Family Law Act 1995 that the divorce he obtained in the United States of America could not be recognised in Ireland, and a declaration pursuant to s29(1) of the Family Law Act, that the marriage originally entered into by the appellant and the respondent was void and had no effect. The question was whether the Circuit Court had the jurisdictions, regarding the findings it made, to conclude that the respondent could be estopped from denying his marriage to the appellant. The Circuit Court Judge set out his findings as follows: > \\"I have found that in this case, given the particular facts of the case, > justice can only be achieved by the use of estoppel whereby the respondent > would not be allowed challenge, at this remove, the validity of his original > divorce.\\" He held: > \\"I believe that justice between the parties can only be achieved by > prohibiting or estopping the respondent from attacking the validity of his > divorce and by definition the validity of his marriage to the applicant. > However, given the law as stated, I accept that the concept of estoppel as a > remedy, well suited to offer a solution in this case, is a judge made and > developed principle. I believe it is preferable for the parties to this > action that prior to a final determination of the case that the Supreme > Court be consulted on this issue.\\" The question posed by the Circuit Court Judge set out for the Supreme Court was: > \\"Whether [the Circuit Court is] entitled to hold in these proceedings as a > matter of law...that the respondent is estopped from denying that he is > married to the applicant\\"  Holding of the Supreme Court  The Court accepted that the Ohio divorce would not be recognised in the Irish State. Consequently, the ceremony of marriage between the appellant and the respondent that took place in 1983 was invalid. However, it was acknowledged that such a situation would allow for considerable injustice to the appellant and also the respondent's previous wife who believed she had been divorced from the respondent. In answering the question posed, however, the Supreme Court answered in the negative - the respondent could not be estopped from denying that he was married to the appellant. It was held the injustice flowed from the fraudulent actions of the respondent inducing the appellant into an invalid marriage. However, legal marital status is a matter of importance not just to the parties to the marriage and their family, but for the world at large. An invalid marriage could not be made valid when it was void from the very beginning. Denham J, in delivering her judgment made her conclusion in light of the decision set out in Gaffney v Gaffney[1975] I.R. 133 where it was established \\"that estoppel may not be used, to change a person's status when that has not occurred, to prevent a party demonstrating that a foreign divorce decree was given without jurisdiction\\". The Court held that \\"[u]nless Gaffney is overruled by this court it is a governing authority on this issue\\" McGuinness J, Fennelly J and McCracken J agreed with this conclusion. Murray J also, fully agreed with this judgement, added that the appellant would have an actionable remedy on the grounds of fraudulent misrepresentation. Murray J went on to note that \\"[i]n order for such an action to be considered...an appropriate remedy for the infringement of constitutional rights any order which a court may make where deceit is established should provide a reasonable measure of compensation for the consequential and foreseeable loss which a plaintiff has sustained\\".  Subsequent developments  This case was considered in AR v DR, where it was highlighted that Denham J had observed the decision in Gaffney v Gaffney regarding how \\"the prohibition on the use of estoppel in cases where marital status is relevant has been a kernel concept of Irish law\\". Acknowledging the wariness of the courts in allowing for the reliance on estoppel regarding a party's legal or family status.

It was designed by Richard Cromwell Carpenter and Edmund Blacket and built from 1848 to 1850 by William Munro. The property is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust Diocese of Sydney. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 August 2018.  History  = Traditional owners = The original inhabitants of the Liverpool area were the Gandangara people. The pre-European landscape of the area consisted of open eucalyptus woodland. Across this country the Gandangara people utilised many of the flora and fauna resources during everyday life. Many aspects of the local landscape would have held spiritual importance for the Gandangara people. It is unknown if the land upon which the Cabramatta village or the church lands associated with the Church of the Holy Innocents was used for any specific economic, settlement, or spiritual/sacred purposes by the Gandangara. = British invasion and settlement = From the early 1800s European settlers began to encroach on Gandangara lands and settle on what they named the Liverpool plains. Directly organised British colonisation of the area commenced in the 1810s during the governorship of Macquarie (1810‚Äì1821) through the alienation of land and the imposition of the rule of British law. Land alienation proceeded through the issuing of large land grants to prominent settlers who had the means to establish extensive stock runs. This resulted in the area being sparsely settled with family estates dotted throughout the landscape.Rosen, 2014:6 These stock runs were often quite isolated with the main meeting and social places being the few local churches or other public amenities such as stores, pubs, and post offices situated along the main thoroughfares of the region. Colonisation of the area continued during the 1820s and 1830s under Governors Brisbane (1821‚Äì1825) and Darling (1825‚Äì1831). However, by the mid-1820s there was a change in the surveying system of the colony undertaken under the orders of Lord Bathurst, which took a more progressive outlook to the future of the colony. This was in response to difficulties in the land surveying department in the early and mid-1820s where the surveying of the numerous grants allocated by Governors Macquarie and Brisbane had not yet been carried out. Lord Bathurst's plan required that the colony be systematically surveyed and split up into counties, hundreds, and parishes and that township, village, public road, school, burial ground, and church reserves be situated in appropriate locations for future need as the local population increased and more free settlers immigrated to the colony. This systematic survey of the entire colony, the Nineteen Counties or the Limits of Location, was eventually carried out by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, Surveyor General from 1828.Foster, 1985 Overall, the imposition of this settlement model on the Australian landscape was one of the early attempts by the British authorities to recreate a British agricultural landscape, dotted with small farms and villages, in the colony. Lord Bathurst's also ordered that one-seventh of the land of each county, according to extent and value, was to be put aside as the Clergy and School Estate. The purpose of this estate was to fund and support the Established Church of England and its clergy in the colony, as well as the education of the colony's youth in Anglican principals. To manage these grants, Lord Bathurst detailed that a Clergy and School Lands Corporation should be established to manage their sale, which would then provide funds for the religious and educational development of the colony. During the surveying of the colony a township reserve was situated in the Parish of Cabramatta, within the County of Cumberland, located to the southwest of Liverpool on the east bank of South Creek. This township was also named Cabramatta and formed the only township reserve allocated to this parish, as the remainder had been granted away during the 1810s and early 1820s. This township reserve was close to the estates of Horningsea Park (Joshua John Moore) and Cow-de-knaves (John Jamieson) and in 1830 the Bellfield Farm estate was established to its north. A school and church reserve was allocated to the Cabramatta village reserve when it was created around 1827. This reserve was one acre in size and came, over time, to comprise an eastern half for a school and church and a western half for a burial ground.NBRS&P;, 1989 Due to the excesses of Governor Macquarie with regard to the construction of public buildings in Sydney and other areas of the colony during his period in office, Colonial officials in London dictated that public needs be met more modestly by Governor Brisbane during his tenure. As a result of this and Lord Bathurst's new plan for the surveying of the Colony, Brisbane established the Clergy and School Lands Corporation in 1826 to manage the provision of education and religious needs to the colony. This corporation was run by a committee of Anglicans which included Archdeacon Thomas Hobbs Scott, the Reverend Samuel, and three prominent Anglican laymen. One of its goals was to provide simple schools and rectories for the local populations in rural areas. It was to have been financed by the sale of the Clergy and School Estate lands, as well as other investments, but funds were slow to be amassed via this method since no land was allocated to the corporation until 1828 (due to issues in the colonial surveying department). As a result, the corporation had only limited funds to operate during its early years. Thus, they operated by building modest, often timber, vernacular buildings in places of need that could serve as both schools and churches. To facilitate this the architects, Joshua Thorp and William Aird, provided the corporation with some designs for simple chapels and school-church buildings. Ultimately, the Clergy and School Lands Corporation was not a success and its activities were suspended in 1829, before its charter was finally revoked in 1833, following complaints from the other denominations about the dominance of the Anglicans.Cable, 1966 In 1827 the Clergy and School Lands Corporation built a simple slab timber school/church hall on the southeast corner of the church reserve in Cabramatta township. This small building was typical of those constructed by the corporation in rural areas to serve the educational and religious needs of these small communities. The hall had a capacity of 100 people and from its opening the acting school master was the Reverend A. Lideliard. This new hall was located in the vast parish of the Cow Pastures which was under the stewardship of the Reverend Thomas Hassall (1794‚Äì1868) from its conception in 1826. It is likely that Hassall occasionally visited this hall to perform services as he toured his parish, with regular services being conducted by a local curate. Soon after the construction of the school/church hall in 1828 the building required further additions and repairs. These works were carried out by an Edward Pender and consisted of laying flooring and skirting, providing church furniture (sofas, a table, and seating for children), and lining and jams for the windows and doors. By 1829 the building was being used once every Sunday for services and in 1830 Reverend Hassall was noted as being the rector or officiating minister of Cabramatta which still had a population of a 100. This suggests that in the years following its construction the hall was used by the populations of the surrounding estates regularly for worship and teaching, along with perhaps other community purposes. Education was the purview of the Church of England during this period and it is likely that the local minister, Reverend Hassall, arranged for the appointment of a qualified headmaster or mistress of the school. After the school/church hall at Cabramatta was erected a cemetery was established at the rear of the school and church reserve. The first recorded burial in this cemetery was a four- month old baby boy, William Fox, on 22 November 1829. This burial and several others during the 1830s and 1840s were registered at surrounding churches (such as St Lukes, Liverpool). It is possible that earlier burials from 1825 or 1827 onwards occurred in the church grounds, but these were unregistered. From 1848, when new lands were granted to the Anglican Church under the Church Act for the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents, this cemetery was officially granted as a burial ground and a register of burials kept from 1851. Despite the repairs made in 1828, by 1832 the slab timber school/church hall was beginning to fall into disrepair and Archdeacon William Broughton advised Reverend Hassall that the building needed to be repaired or demolished. Consequently, in December 1832, Hassall commissioned substantial repairs to the hall by Joseph Heron to improve the buildings suitability as a church. The documentation for these repairs reveals that the building had a school room and two small \\"back\\" rooms. At this time there was still one chaplain (Hassall) servicing Cabramatta and the surrounding region, which was now described as the Cook district and also included Mulgoa, South Creek, Camden, and Stone Quarry Creek. The following year (1833) Robert Bell, the owner of the estate to the north adjoining the Cabramatta town reserve, petitioned the government to finally establish a township and offer the town allotments at auction. Bell hoped to add to his estate through this process and provide himself with a road access to his property via Bringelly Road. Following this request the government further investigated the site, but the Surveyor General reported to the Colonial Secretary that the reserve was not on the great road, was \\"ill-watered\\" and, therefore, not suitable for the establishment of a town. Consequently, it was not until 1840 that the town allotments were put up at auction and Robert Bell was able to purchase the majority to add to his estate. Plans for a permanent church at Cabramatta In 1836 the local Anglican community were using the hall (log built school house) for services on a fortnightly basis with its capacity being recorded as 60 people. The passing of the Church Act this year encouraged Bishop Broughton to begin plans to construct a permanent and substantial church at Cabramatta for this district. At this time the populations of the surrounding estates were growing and a need was seen for a more permanent and auspicious church. Two hundred pounds was soon subscribed, mainly by the local population, for the cost of this church. The local community felt that this new church should be dedicated to the Holy Innocents. This name indicates the \\"high church\\" leanings of the local congregation and their designs for the church. In contrast \\"low church\\" churches are normally named after saints. The Feast of the Holy Innocents, after which the church is named, is more of an orthodox catholic tradition. Governor Burke's (1831‚Äì1837) 1836 Church Act granted state recognition and support for the main denominations operating in Australia: the Church of England, Presbyterian Church, and Catholic Church. It provided extra funding through a pound for pound subsidy for new churches costing between 600 and 2000 pounds. However, before a church could be built the local area was required to prove, through a petition, that at least 150 residents of the particular denomination were present and would use and support the church. This Act was designed to forward the construction of churches of these denominations across the colony while also providing funding for the stipends of ministers and, generally, improve the moral condition of the still largely convict population. To further encourage new church construction the Act also made additional land grants available for churches and schools. However, it required new churches to be designed by a professional architect and approved by the colonial architect. Through recognising and assisting other denominations this Act served to diminish the power of the Church of England in Australia, which had previously been the de facto Established Church of the colony. This was especially so after Bourke later extended the Act to include the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Baptist Christian denominations, as well as Judaism. In this manner, the Act helped to foster a religious pluralism in the colony. Broughton had arrived in Australia in 1829 to fill the post of Archdeacon of NSW. He was a High Churchman and firm supporter of the Church of England and would not countenance deviation from its established rules in the colony. At the time of his arrival there were only eight parish churches in the colony (of which the majority had been constructed by Macquarie) and Broughton soon sought to remedy this situation. When back in England in 1835‚Äì1836 he organised for an annual 1000 pound grant from the English Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, as well as other immediate gifts, that allowed him to bring clergy to Australia and begin the work of building churches and rectories throughout the colony. As an amateur architect and enthusiast in ecclesiological architecture Broughton also procured suitable drawings and working plans for churches. While the 1836 Church Act gave considerable impetus to church expansion, great organisation was required to see a church constructed, and Bishop Broughton was a tireless and long travelling organiser who helped see the construction of many churches. He consecrated or dedicated almost a hundred church buildings throughout his long episcopate career demonstrating his organisational skills and dedication to this cause. In 1836 Broughton was elevated to the Bishopric of the new see of Australia. Just prior to this, in 1835, he had been exposed to the work of the Oxford scholars that came to be known as Tractarians.Appendix 1 Although Broughton never considered himself a Tractarian, he was influenced by their work and sympathised with and supported them by giving them appointments where possible. This support of the Tractarians, and by extension the Cambridge Camden Society, led Broughton to establish Gothic architecture as the most suitable for ecclesiological architecture in the colony. Prior to the mid-1830s gothic ornamentation had only been used on the exterior of new churches in an amateur fashion and it was only just beginning to be seen as a suitable style for \\"modern\\" ecclesiological architecture. This state of affairs continued into the early 1840s due to a lack of skilled tradesmen and competent and knowledgeable architects, despite the incentives of the Church Act. It was not until the mid-1840s that an influx of Scottish tradesmen and architects such as Edmund BlacketAppendix 3 began to alleviate this situation. Prior to this the Anglican Church Act norm had been small symmetrical churches with almost double cube proportions, symmetrical north and south porches placed midway along the length of the church, western bell-cotes, and detailing such as buttresses, hood-moulds, and pinnacles. From the 1840s there was a definitive move toward medievalism in Anglican ecclesiological architecture as the Gothic Revival movement took hold in the colony and by the mid-1840s there was a definite commitment to archaeological fidelity (a commitment to correct medieval detail) in gothic architecture. The construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents Throughout the early 1840s efforts continued towards the construction of a permanent church at Cabramatta, but it appears that funds were slow to be raised due to the collapse of the colonial wool industry. This is likely as many of the local large estates holders were among those who subscribed towards the construction of the church, including the holders of \\"Vermont (J. J. Riley Esq)\\", \\"Berling (Mrs S. Lowe)\\", \\"Bellfield (Robert Bell Esq)\\", \\"Retreat Farm (Alfred Kennerley Esq)\\", \\"Newstead\\", \\"Eastwood\\", \\"Wilton Park (A. J. Lidingtone)\\", and \\"Exeter Farms\\". In 1845 when the Reverend George Vidal was appointed to the Parish of Denham Court and the Cabramatta area was subsumed into this parish it was reported that services at the school/church hall were held fortnightly and attended by an average of 20 people. However, while services were held as Cabramatta regularly, confirmations and marriages were held at St Mary's Denham Court. Despite the incentive of the Church Act and the assistance of Bishop Broughton it took the local congregation and the Anglican Church until 1846 before the necessary funds (311 pounds) were gathered to commence the design and construction of the new church at Cabramatta. Bishop Broughton chose a Gothic Revival design produced by one of the Cambridge Camden Society's leading architects, Richard Cromwell Carpenter.Appendix 2 Carpenter had designed and built St John the Baptist Church at Cookham Dean in Berkshire, England in 1844‚Äì45 and it was a copy of this design that Bishop Broughton had acquired through Reverend William Horatio Walsh, a correspondent of the Society's journal. Reverend Walsh had met Edmund Blacket when he had been appointed to finish Christ Church St Laurence in 1843 and been introduced to Gothic architecture by him. They, subsequently, became close friends as Christ Church was Blacket's parish church and Reverend Walsh, therefore, his Rector and one of his great supporters. The finished design of Christ Church in 1845 was unapologetically High Church and Tractarian and caused a great scandal among the Evangelical Anglicans in the colony . Reverend Walsh became a leader among the colonial Tractarians, which explains his promotion of Carpenter's Gothic Revival inspired church design to Bishop Broughton. The Church of St John the Baptist, Cookham Dean, had been described and lauded in the societies' journal \\"The Ecclesiologist\\" when it was completed in 1845, to which Bishop Broughton and other members of the colonial clergy subscribed. In this article it was described as a fourteenth century style church of \\"a very simple\\" and \\"most satisfactory design\\" but \\"not mean or starved\\" and \\"of unpretending but solemn character\\". It is highly likely that it was these properties of the design that brought it to Broughton's attention and inspired him to acquire copies of the drawings. Previously a copy of this design had been acquired by Bishop Nixon of Tasmania and it was used to construct a church at Buckland, Tasmania between August 1846 and January 1849. Edmund Blacket, soon after his arrival in the Colony in 1842, had come to the attention of Broughton. He subsequently made use of Blacket's knowledge of Gothic architecture to further his plans to provide proper ecclesiological buildings within his diocese. Blacket, as Diocese Architect, amended and drew up the construction plans for the new Cabramatta church based on the Carpenter design provided to him by Bishop Broughton. The dictates of Gothic Revival architecture at this time commended and encouraged the authentic replication of medieval designs. In this tradition Blacket kept most of the prominent elements of Carpenter's design, while decreasing the size of the church, changing its construction materials from stone to brick, adding to some aspects of the design, and designing the interior nave and chancel furniture and trimmings. He likely also set out the tracery geometry for the building. Blacket also definitely designed the beautiful fourteen century style stone font as this design is extant within his papers at the Mitchell Library. In this manner, the Church of the Holy Innocents remained an authentic Carpenter design while being adapted to an Australian location and landscape. In December 1849 Blacket became the Colonial Architect and in this capacity had the responsibility of supervising the continued construction of the church.Morton, 1977:11 Prior to the construction of the church, a survey was undertaken of the church lands in March 1848 in association with the granting of additional lands for the new church under the Church Act (this included the original church reserve). Following this grant the church lands now comprised three acres which were described as: two roods for a school house associated with the United Church of England and Ireland; two roods for a dwelling house, garden, and other appurtenances for the clergyman; and one acre for a burial ground. The trustees of these church lands were John Campbell, James John Riley, and Edward Lummas Moore. Two road reserves were also added to the Cabramatta town plan to the east and west of the new church lands at this time. The foundation stone for the Church of the Holy Innocents was laid on 28 December 1848 (Holy Innocents Day) by Bishop Broughton with an accompanying ceremony. Holy Innocents Days or the Feast of the Holy Innocents is a festival held by the Christian Churches that commemorates or mourns the massacre of male children by King Herod during his attempts to kill the infant Jesus (the Slaughter of the Innocents).Matthew 2:16‚Äì18 These children were considered to be the first martyrs by the early church. For some years prior to this the local congregation had continued having services in the school/church hall and on this day a service was held in the building that was officiated by the Reverend George Vidal. Bishop Broughton's speech at the ceremony was somewhat political in tone, referring to recent events that had eroded the position of the Church of England as the colony: It is likely that Broughton was making a statement with the design and construction of this church about the status of the Church of England in colonial society and what its future directions should be (i.e. High Church and Tractarian). Its first reverend, George Vidal, was a recognised \\"High Churchman\\" and Tractarian and was sympathetic to the ideals of Bishop Broughton and the Camden Cambridge Society. Construction of the Church began immediately afterwards and was overseen by the builder William Monroe. Monroe was a local Liverpool builder already with some experience in church construction within the local area. He had immigrated to the colony in the early 1840s as part of a scheme to encourage tradesmen to settle in the colony. Munro's detailed accounts of the building works are extant at the NSW State Archives, which shows that he was a skilled and experienced builder and able to produce a first rate result with minimal drawings and supervision. His later building work included a Catholic Church at Berrima that brought him to the attention of Bishop Polding who became his patron. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he steadily gained in experience so that he could act as an architect and by the late 1850s he had been appointed Diocese Architect of the Sydney Catholic Church, a position he served throughout the 1860s. Later in 1873 he also acted as the architect for the Presbyterian College of St Andrew at Sydney University. However, he has been described as a poor architect, despite his experience in building a number of churches designed by prominent architects. According to the common procedures of the Church Act the construction work was regularly inspected by Edmund Blacket acting as Colonial Architect. His inspections allowed him to certify the accounts for the construction and report to the Colonial Secretary so the government funds for the work, 350 pounds, could be paid out. The church was completed in October 1850, just under two years after the commencement of construction, and it was consecrated by Bishop Broughton on 7 November 1850. The following year a brief report appeared in the Ecclesiologist, authored by Canon Horatio Walsh, describing its small nature but commenting that \\"its forms and details within and without show[ing] a most satisfactory example of ecclesiological development\\". Operation of the Church of the Holy Innocents Throughout its life the Church of the Holy Innocents at Cabramatta, and then Rossmore, has been situated in two Parishes: Denham Court and Cobbitty. It was attached to the Parish of Denham Court up until 1877 when it was moved into the boundaries of the Parish of Narellan-Cobbitty. It was then moved back into the boundaries of the Parish of Denham Court in 1901. From 1901 to 1925 this \\"parish\\" was known as the Mission District of Denham Court and Rossmore (which included Minto until 1916). In 1926 Denham Court and Rossmore were made a parish.Nepean Times, 3 August 1907:2 At the time of the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents the incumbent for the Parish of Denham Court was the Reverend George Vidal (1815‚Äì1878) who became one of the High Churchmen of the colony. He is known to have had some sympathy for the ideals of the Cambridge Camden Society and Tractarianism. Reverend Vidal was ordained by Bishop Broughton as a Deacon in 1840 and as a Priest in 1841 before being appointed to the Parish of Denham Court in 1846. He remained in this parish, serving at St Mary the Virgin Church at Denham Court and the Church of the Holy Innocents at Cabramatta until 1855 when he was transferred to the parish of Mulgoa (near Penrith). In 1867 he was appointed incumbent of Christ Church, St Laurence, Sydney and soon after appointed a canon. He remained in this position until his death in 1878. After the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents the original timber slab school/church hall continued to be used as a community hall (and possibly a school) until c.1886 when a new weatherboard and galvanised iron hall was built. This was during the early years of the Parish of Cobbitty's management of the church. This new Church Hall was intended to serve as a place where community gatherings could be held and funds raised for the upkeep of the church and church yard. From 1902 the hall was also used as a school until 1920 when Rossmore Public School was established on the opposite side of Bringelly Road, During WWII the hall was again used as a government school for a brief period from 1939 onwards. Community gatherings continued to be held in the hall until 1982 before the building was demolished in 1987. The current brick rectory to the southeast of the churchyard was constructed in the same year with the Reverend Ross Nicholson serving as the first curate. The old school/church hall was not demolished when the new church hall was built in the 1880s and it appears to have continued in some form of use up until 1931 when it was destroyed by bushfires according to oral tradition. =Appendix 1: The Tractarian Movement and Cambridge Camden Society= The early nineteenth century was a time of revolution in doctrine and liturgy for the Church of England as it faced challenges to its dominance and a curtailment of its privileges in Britain as the UK moved more towards secularism and religious pluralism. These changes led many Anglicans to fight back against what they saw as unjust attacks against the proper English Church and attempt to revitalise it to restore its prominence.Elliot, 1995 The Oxford or Tractarian movement, named after their publication \\"Tracts for the Times\\", was formed at Oxford in 1833 as a new school of churchmanship. Initially, it was a focussed on ascertaining the rightful position and nature of the Church of England within contemporary society. It had been formed as a protest against the State and liberal pressure being directed against the Church of England at the time and was part of the Church taking stock of its purpose and mission. However, as it rapidly grew and was influenced by the Romantic Movement it morphed into a widespread affirmation of the spiritual and historical integrity and apostolic character of the Church of England. It insisted that the sacramental character of the Church be given proper reverence. The movement argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. Overall, Tractarianism focussed on the Catholic heritage of the church and the apostolic succession, espoused that the liturgical emphasis should be on the sacraments, and was strongly opposed to any segregation in church based on social differentiation. At this time the liturgical emphasis of the Church of England was on the spoken word with the pulpit being the focus of attention and there was commonly social segregation through the use of rented pews for the wealthy and open galleries for the poor.Judd and Cable, 2000 The emphasis of Tractarianism on the sacraments reflected the devotion of the movement to the supernatural. For them the sacraments acted as \\"an outward sign of an invisible inward happening\\" where the minister was the magical link between the congregation and God. Symbolism served as the means by which the link between the real and supernatural worlds were expressed. In this manner the following architectural forms symbolised or represented: the nave the Church Militant; the rood the Church Expectant; the chancel the Church Triumphant; three steps the Trinity; the octagonal form Eternity; the eagle for St John; the alb purity; and the stole as the priest's reminder of the yoke of his responsibilities. The Tractarians also incorporated the Gothic (or medieval) spirit into their movement. This involved both the incorporation of this spirit into theology, but also the interrelating of Gothic architecture with \\"historical Anglican thought and practice\\".Lucas, Stapleton, and Partners, 2001 Tractarianism was, overall, a divisive movement, as among its supporters it generated much excitement, but at the same time it brought about resolute and firm opposition among its, often Evangelical, opponents. The nature of the movement to look towards the medieval past for inspiration led its liberal critics to label it as retrogressive and its Evangelical opponents as pro-Roman Catholic and a threat to the Protestant Church. Indeed, several of the movement's leaders seceded to the Roman Catholic Church. There was some focus by this movement on colonial spheres where a lack of establishment allowed greater scope for change, particularly in contrast to the restrictive conditions in England. This was especially the case during the earlier phases of the movement when its ambitions were Empire wide in scope. The early nineteenth century was a period of expansion of the British Empire and in each new colony the Church of England was forced to establish itself. The Tractarians perceived this to be an excellent opportunity to create models of their new order to demonstrate to their British audience and acted to provide support for colonial bishops in terms of clergy, funds, and designs, just when they were most needed. In NSW the reduction of the Church of England to denominational status after the 1836 Church Act garnered the movement some sympathy among colonial clergy. It became established in the colonial church in the 1840s under the patronage of Bishop Broughton and invigorated the local church, but at the cost of more than a century of conflict within its circles. Generally, \\"High Churchmen\\", such as Bishop Broughton were persuaded by the Tractarian arguments, but the older, usually Evangelical, colonial clergy were opposed to and infuriated by it. The Cambridge Camden Society, later the Ecclesiological Society, was originally established to study the design and execution of ecclesiastical ornaments and buildings. This organisation was closely allied with the Tractarian movement as their goal was to provide structural expression for the liturgical and doctrinal ideals they developed. They eventually settled on Gothic architecture as being the most fitting for church construction and promoted these designs in Britain and across her colonies. In accordance with their goals they had very stringent architectural standards and design requirements. The society advocated an architectural form known as \\"symbolic sacramentality\\" which was a system where the material fabric of the structure was designed to symbolise or embody some abstract meaning and through which an expression of liturgy could be articulated structurally. In essence the society aimed to develop a style that could best embody \\"both liturgical and architectural beauty without striving for effect\\". This society aimed to implement the reformations of the Tractarian Movement through igniting a change in ecclesiological architecture in England. The favoured design or icon of the society ultimately came to be an idealised version of the 14th Century English country parish church and particularly the designs modelled after this type by its favoured architects in the 1830s and 1840s. This design stressed the proper definition and separation of the nave and chancel; the allocation of the chancel with fair proportions; the placement of the font at the entrance to the church; the addition of an exterior porch; the provision of aisles with the subsequent threefold division of the nave symbolising the holy trinity; the provision of an un-galleried nave furnished with open benches; the establishment of the chancel, sanctuary, and altar as the focus of the congregation through their elevation with steps (ideally three each); the sub- division of the chancel into a chorus cantorum and sacrarium; and the alignment of the church so that it faced east. Church design should also encourage the exclusion of the congregation from the chancel. A tower was not considered an essential element, but if provided should be at the west end or at the crossing of the church if it featured transepts. The most ideal gothic style was the Decorated dating to between 1260‚Äì1360 (13th‚Äì14th Centuries) and building materials stone, or less so flints, with bricks only being used as an alternative when neither was available. In this manner, a church should emphasise auditory and hierarchal values in its architecture. This design was in contrast to the traditional early nineteenth century style that featured high box pews, triple-decker pulpit, and a western gallery containing harmonium and choir. The society's development during the 1830s‚Äì1850s coincided with an intense period of church building in England which was often rationalised as being a response to population growth associated with the Industrial Revolution. At this time the society was optimistically encouraging the building of churches and growth of the faith in anticipation and in response to population growth, as well as a means of re-converting much of the wayward rural population that were in need of redemption. As such, many of its members held a missionary zeal to spread the word of Tractarianism and develop a common faith across the Empire. This period lasted until the early 1860s (after 50 years of intense church building) when the emergence of a secular alternative eroded the power of the church and led to a decrease in church attendance and patronage. In accordance with the interest of the Tractarian movement in Colonial spheres the Cambridge Camden Society also attempted to spread their influence in this direction. This took the form of dispersing acceptable drawings for a range of ecclesiological correct church designs, including most prominently those of the rural country parish church design, through clerical networks and their own publications to assist in educating and training colonial clergy and architects in ecclesiology. This was particularly achieved through colonial clergy gathering appropriate designs and information on their visits back to England. There was some attempt to provide suitable designs for different climates, but usually faithful English designs were favoured by local populations, despite their unsuitability in some cases.Kerr, 1977 Ultimately Tractarianism and the Cambridge Camden Society brought about a gradual move towards a more sacramental form of worship and the introduction of a separate choir within the Church of England over the second half of the nineteenth century. This resulted in most churches across England being converted in accordance with the Cambridge Camden Society's requirements (through the construction of new churches or the restoration or remodelling of existing churches) and the substitution of music for speech in common doctrine in accordance with the shift from the word and the pulpit to the altar and the sacraments. Consequently, over this time Tractarianism gradually replaced Evangelicalism as the norm in the Church of England in Britain. In the colony Tractarianism, despite some crises, continued to develop under Bishop Broughton up until his death in 1853. The new Bishop of Australia was the Evangelical Bishop Barker and he encouraged the Anglican Colonial Church to move towards an Evangelical revival that generally preferred the Low Church approach to Anglican worship. =Appendix 2: Richard Cromwell Carpenter (1812‚Äì1855)= Richard Cromwell Carpenter throughout his career rose to become one of the most prominent ecclesiastical architects in England. He was strongly associated with the Gothic Revival Movement, Victorian High Church, and Cambridge Camden Society.Oxford DNB Carpenter was born in Clerkenwell, London, in 1812 and educated at Charterhouse School. His professional career began in 1827‚Äì1828 when he was apprenticed to John Blyth and it was soon discovered that he had an inclination for ecclesiastical architecture. His architectural career began to take off in the 1830s with his first executed commissions being for secular projects. In 1840 he married Amelia Dollman (1821‚Äì1891) and together they had four children. Carpenter's career as an ecclesiastical architect blossomed during the 1840s. Between 1840 and 1841 he was introduced to the Cambridge Camden Society by A. W. N. Pugin, a leading architect of the Gothic Revival movement, and became a convert to the movement and soon one of the society's favoured architects. He was strongly associated with the \\"High Church\\" and the Cambridge Camden Society over his career with these connections providing a great many of his firm's commissions. Over his career he designed 28 churches, of which half were built, and several cathedrals, which all remained unexecuted. He also restored 36 churches, two cathedrals, and an abbey. Among his church designs were characteristic plans for town and rural churches that came to mark a \\"Carpenter\\" church. His \\"town\\" churches were usually substantial hall churches that were intended to be accompanied by a dominant spire. His \\"rural\\" churches were an idealised reproduction of a fourteenth century country parish church. They were small and simple and featured a separate chancel and nave and western bell cote, as well as an emphasis on mass in their design. They had the following characteristics: a dominant nave and chancel that featured a structurally evidenced division; aisles that were subsidiary spaces; a bell-cote to summon the laity to worship and which signified the consecration; nave and chancel featuring sharply pitched roofs and aisles with lean-to roofs and a lack of a clerestory; an elevated chancel and raised altar; buttresses serving structural and symbolic purposes; the use of local and honest building materials; and the overall style being first or second pointed. Towards the end of his career several of Carpenter's designs were included in the Cambridge Camden Society's second edition of the Instrumenta ecclesiastica, which was the premier design book of the society. This edition was published in 1856, a year after Carpenter's death from tuberculosis at the age of 42 at his home in London. At his death some members of the society considered Carpenter architectural skill to be superior to that of Pugin as he was \\"safer and more equable\\" and had an exquisite eye for colour. His success was deemed to lie in his ability to ensure the keeping of \\"the harmony of parts and general unity of proportion\\" within his designs. The Church of the Holy Innocents is based on Carpenter's \\"rural\\" church design. In particular the design of St John the Baptist, Cookham Dean, Berkshire (1844‚Äì1845) which was exported to Australia and resulted in the design of the Church of the Holy Innocents and St John the Baptist, Buckland, Tasmania (1846‚Äì1848). Specifically, the followings aspects of the Church of the Holy Innocents are characteristic of this design: the steep roofs (unnecessary in the Australian climate), dominant bell cote and gable cross, symbolic buttresses, wooden porch, and geometric widows. In this manner, the Church of the Holy Innocents is strongly associated with this strand of Carpenter's ecclesiastical career and demonstrative of his notable designs and his connections with the Cambridge Camden Society and Tractarianism. =Appendix 3: Edmund Thomas Blacket (1817‚Äì1883)= Blacket is recognised as one of Australia's leading architects of the nineteenth century, especially in the field of ecclesiological architecture. He was an innovator in ecclesiological architecture from the 1840s through to the 1880s, who, over his long career, produced a large number of high quality churches. Blacket was born at St Margaret's Hill, Southwark, Surrey, England on 25 August 1817. His father was the merchant James Blacket and his mother was Margaret Harriet (nee Ralph). He was educated at Mill Hill Congregational College and then spent three years in the family trade business before deciding to pursue a different calling. Initially he found employment in his brother's mill in Yorkshire before joining the Stockton and Darlington Railway Company around 1837 as a surveyor and engineer. While working for this company he became a skilled draftsman and surveyor, which were skills that were to serve him admirably later in life. His success as an engineer prompted his father to reward him with the funds to undertake a year travelling England sketching and recording details of medieval architecture. Between 1838 and 1841 he undertook many similar smaller journeys during which he produced many picturesque sketches of medieval architecture. After leaving Yorkshire in 1841 Blacket spent a year in London employed in inspecting schools for the Archbishop of Canterbury. Blacket married Sarah Mease (1818‚Äì1869) on 21 May 1842 at Holy Trinity Church, Wakefield, Yorkshire, after overcoming considerable opposition to the match amongst both families. His father's reluctant approval allegedly required that Blacket leave the country, but it is also possible that the new couple sought the opportunities of the new Australian colony for their own purposes. Soon after they married, Edmund and Sarah sailed to Sydney, arriving on 3 November 1842. Blacket is thought to have carried letters of introduction to Bishop Broughton and Charles Nicholson, which allowed him to be appointed valuator to Bourke ward, Sydney and, most importantly, the inspector of the Church of England schools in the colony at the start of 1843. This position required that he design and supervise the construction of many school buildings, parsonages, and churches, and he was allowed to establish a private practice in May 1843. This role allowed him to present his architectural skills to Bishop Broughton who at the time was undertaking a rigorous campaign of church building and required someone with good architectural skills to assist him. Therefore, Blacket was soon able to establish a modest architectural practice and become known colloquially as the \\"Church Architect\\". Over the following years, he won respect for his sound work on a number of commissions and demonstrated his outstanding knowledge of Gothic styles through the construction of a number of new churches, as well as the redesign and completion of a number of unfinished cathedrals. This led him to be officially appointed Diocese architect by Bishop Broughton in 1847. On 1 December 1849 Blacket was appointed Colonial Architect, replacing Mortimer Lewis, and he remained in this position until September 1854. During this time he remained Diocese architect and continued to oversee work on a number of cathedrals and churches he has begun previously to this appointment. However, generally, this period was a time of stagnation in the colony's building industry due to the gold rushes that drew away the local workforce. On 30 September 1854 Blacket became The University of Sydney official architect, while retaining the right of private practice, and he subsequently designed many of its original buildings. From this time his reputation spread and grew throughout the colony and his architectural practice thrived accepting commissions on schools, colleges, banks, hospitals, commercial buildings, domestic buildings, and numerous Anglican churches. This diversity of work allowed him to be more creative architecturally and further develop the Gothic style in his ecclesiological work, while also experimenting with the Italianate style for commercial buildings. Sarah Blacket died in 1869 leaving Edmund with four sons and four daughters to raise and provide for. Three of his sons, Cyril (1858‚Äì1937), Arthur, and Owen, spent time in Blacket's practice. Cyril had joined the practice in 1872 and afterwards spent time travelling Britain, Western Europe, and North America, before returning in 1880 and becoming a partner. This caused the firm to become Blacket & Son. Edmund passed away only a few years later, on 9 February 1883, at his home in Petersham. Blacket was a stout and steadfast Anglican known for his good public character. He was respected and admired across the colony for his honesty, diligence, accuracy, fortitude, and propriety. Through his architectural career he scattered the colony with many handsome gothic churches and fulfilled one of his life's great ambitions. Blacket was a self-taught architect and dedicated adherent of the \\"archaeological\\" or correct school of Gothic architecture and was in this way not a Tractarian, but an Anglican of the Established Church. Archaeological gothic was the Early Victorian fashion, as publicised by the Camden Cambridge Society, and required strict adherence to and understanding of medieval gothic styles. As an archaeological gothicist Blacket's goal when building new churches was to create replicas of English medieval parish churches. To accomplish this during the early portion of his career (up to around 1860) Blacket operated by basing his designs on existing English churches (usual contemporary Gothic Revival churches) and then incorporating published medieval details available in copy or pattern books, magazines, newspapers, or his own note books. This was the approach any colonial architect had to use when designing a gothic building in Australia. While operating in this manner Blacket created some beautiful and imposing churches and he was particularly well known for his meticulous detailing and how he exploited good craftsmanship to reveal the intrinsic qualities of building materials. Blacket had a deep knowledge of gothic architecture and he continued to keep abreast of developments in the Gothic Revival movement and this allowed him to consistently, knowledgably, and effectively piece together the stylistic motifs of his churches.Kerr, 1980 During the early stage of his colonial career Blacket's ecclesiological work was dominated by Bishop Broughton and his amateur architectural desires and motivations for the colonial church based on his High Church ideals and support for the Cambridge Camden Society and Tractarian movement. Broughton's connections in England (and his trips back there) allowed him to keep abreast of ecclesiological advances which influenced his designs for ecclesiological architecture in the colony. Blacket's youth, inexperience, and social obligations required that he submit to Broughton's architectural designs and the requests of other clerics and influential laymen that he design exact replicas of notable English village churches. Consequently, between 1843 and 1845 Blacket was merely involved in drawing up designs developed or provided by Bishop Broughton and ensuring that they were faithfully and competently built. The trend for English replicas in ecclesiological architecture continued through the 1840s and 1850s due to the English and Anglican backgrounds of Blacket's clients. This was in order to recall the glories of medieval England, as well as demonstrate the manner of proper Anglican worship. In time Blacket became the leading colonial architect specialising in catering to this Anglomania. The 1840s was Blacket's time of major experimentation. It is possible to view his early ecclesiological works as experiments with the wide range of forms and styles permitted within the strict English tradition and precepts of the Gothic Revival. This was despite the fact that the majority of the churches he designed during this period were replicas of English designs. These churches and cathedrals were created by following specific designs sent from England or available in magazines, newspapers, and pattern books. This was in accordance with the dictates of the premier Camden Cambridge Society architects, such as Pugin, who encourage the following of English tradition in church design and not personal originality. Overall, Blacket's work during this period allowed him to develop a series of prototypes for specific styles he would consistently use throughout his career.Kerr, 1983 After Blacket became Diocese architect in 1847 and Colonial Architect in 1849 he grew in confidence and assurance and began to be more resolute with relation to his design choices for new buildings, allowing him to express his own voice. His time as colonial architect did not produce many public buildings, but it was successful in terms of routine maintenance and administration. Bishop Broughton died in 1853 and his successor Bishop Frederic Barker abhorred Tractarians and ecclesiologists and had no interest in architecture which gave Blacket free rein on further church designs. However, he still heavily favoured Gothic designs over the rest of his career according to his conviction that Early English styles were proper for small churches and Perpendicular styles for collegiate buildings.Woffenden, 1969 During the 1850s and 1860s Blacket moved beyond imitation utilising his experience from the 1840s to create his own vision of the English medieval parish church based on his own repertoire of designs and building details. This resulted in him refining a type of small stone rural church that was to be reproduced a large number of times across different areas of the colony throughout the remainder of this career. These churches were based on the medieval English ideal and featured \\"separately- roofed parts, little bellcotes, gabled roofs, and pointed windows\\" and Blacket's variant was perfect for the predominately rural NSW colony. This became the archetypal Victorian Church of NSW and it was continually requested by Blacket's clients. The 1860s also became the era of the Blacket town church which became archetypal among Anglicans throughout the rest of Blacket's Career. By this time, as ecclesiological architecture moved away from Pugin's strict emulative medievalism, more innovative and original Gothic Revival churches were beginning to be produced in the High Victorian style. Blacket kept up with this architectural trend throughout the late 1860s and 1870s actively bringing in the High Victorian style into his ecclesiological work. Unfortunately, Blacket's later churches are less inventive or varied than his early ones as once he became the dominant authority on ecclesiological architecture in the colony he tended to safely reproduce churches of particular styles based on the design repertoire he developed in his youth. In conclusion, Kerr (1983:13) has characterised Blacket's architectural career as containing three periods: the 1840s experimental period which created the most important churches for the development of church architecture in the colony of the time; the 1850s‚Äì1860s period of individual expression and development of a repertoire of designs for specific building types and features which resulted in the construction of his most loved churches; and the late 1860s to early 1880s experimentation with High Victorian Gothic styles which created his major ecclesiological works.  Description  This item comprises the Church of the Holy Innocents (and its original furnishings), its associated cemetery and churchyard, and the archaeological site of the original slab timber school/church hall. These features are situated on four lots which were granted to the Church of England in 1848 under the 1836 Church Act. They are nonsequentially arranged from north to south as 1, 4, 2, and 3. = Archaeological site of the original school/church hall = The original slab timber school/church hall was constructed in 1827 by the Clergy and School Lands Corporation. It was located in the southeast corner of the original 1825 Church Reserve and is thought to have been a simple, cheap, multipurpose building like others constructed by the corporation. According to oral tradition it was destroyed by a bushfire in 1931 after it had been replaced by a new Church Hall in . Its archaeological remains are potentially extant within the churchyard in the southeast corner of the current Lot 4.Austral Archaeology, 2011:21 This area comprises an indistinct flat platform area adjacent to two pepper trees. Unfortunately, no archaeological features or artefacts are evident besides this platform.Site Inspection 28 November 2016 However, this site could feasibly contain archaeological resources such as foundation remains and preserved construction materials including post-holes, hearths, or wall-base slots. Other occupational deposits, such as underfloor layers or rubbish pits, may also be present within, and surrounding, the site. = Cemetery = The cemetery was originally contained within the western half of the original church reserve (the present Lot 4) to the rear of the original school/church yard. The first known burial in the cemetery was conducted in 1829 and it continued to be used throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A few burials are present from the twenty-first century, with the most recent being from 2007. The cemetery continues in use today and is mostly confined to Lot 4, but intrudes slightly into Lot 2. Due to how the cemetery was originally located at the rear of the original church reserve, burials have spread from the rear fence of the churchyard towards the Church Street frontage over time. After the construction of the Church of the Holy Innocents in 1848‚Äì1850 this involved the burials spreading along its south side in the area that provided access to the church (via the porch). Some burials are located directly behind the church, and a few are present on its north side (where the vestry entrance is located). As such, the oldest burials in the cemetery, which comprise a typical variety of Georgian and Early Victorian graves and monuments, with some featuring fine detailing, are located in the rear section. This section includes graves for a number of members of the original pioneer families of the local area such as the Bells from nearby Bellfield Farm. Burials from the early twentieth century are located closer to the west side of the church and around the current path from the church porch to the parking area. The most recent burials are located on the east side of the cemetery. In all, the cemetery comprises approximately 100 extant graves or memorials. Those with visible inscriptions date from the 1840s through to the recent past. However, there are several sandstone graves that are now too eroded for their inscriptions to be made out. Around a dozen headstones have also fallen over and become disassociated with their original graves. Some of these are lying across the cemetery and others have been rested up against the north side of the church. The remaining graves and headstones range in condition from poor to good with subsidence being a major issue. A fair number of headstones are listing to one side and are in danger of collapsing. However, there are plans in 2017 for conservation works by the Diocese of Sydney to stabilise these headstones. Remarkably the cemetery has suffered little to no vandalism likely due to its semi-rural location. According to available historical recordsNepean Family History Society, 1984 there must be a fair number of unmarked graves in the cemetery, particularly those dating to the earliest periods of use (late 1820s‚Äì1840s). An unusual hardwood engraved gravestone is preserved in the vestry that possibly belongs to John McKaughan and dates to 1848. It is unknown where this gravestone was originally located. As of a site inspection on the 28 November 2016 the cemetery has recently been subjected to good gardening maintenance following the acquisition of the property by the Diocese of Sydney. This has resulted in the removal of much of the previous vegetation overgrowth at the rear of the cemetery and the general cleaning-up of the whole area. = Churchyard = The churchyard is confined mostly within Lot 4 (but perhaps partially within Lot 2) and is generally well kept and features scatted various trees plantings, but mostly eucalyptus. However, due to a lack of fencing around this feature it blends into the undeveloped Lot 1 to the north and the carpark and modern buildings to the south in Lots 2 and 3. As such, today the Churchyard is to some degree indistinct and difficult to demarcate, where in the past it featured fences to separate it from the surrounding lots. The church property only features a complete fence along its west and south boundaries: on the west side this consists of a modern wire fence and on the south side a modern corrugated metal fence. However, there are elements of an older fence along the east boundary which is evident as a long low mound. Other extant fence elements include corner posts at the north and south ends and four matching posts and a surviving panel of a white picket fence in poor condition around the driveway entrance to the churchyard. These large hardwood posts have decorative \\"onion dome\\" carved tops and their associated picket fence features turned timber pickets. Square wooden posts from a former picket gate are also located at the rear of the cemetery along the west boundary of the property where a former grass pathway from the church porch to the rear of the property was located. A modern driveway leads from the front gate of the churchyard to the south side of the church. A few remnant pine and cypress trees from former more extensive plantings along this feature are extant along its length. Another paved path leads from the church porch to the dirt carpark on Lot 2 adjacent the new Church Hall. It bisects the early 20th Century section of the cemetery. One or two pine trees from former extensive plantings along the Church Street frontage are also extant. The southern Lots 2 and 3 contain the dirt carpark, brick rectory (1987), and stone and brick church hall (1980s). The rectory is currently leased out to tenants and the Church Hall is leased to the local Baptist Church for services and other community uses. The brick rectory, stone and brick church hall, and dirt carpark do not add to the significance of the place and are considered to be non-contributory features. The northern Lot 1 is undeveloped and is covered in a small stand of immature eucalyptus trees (dating to after the 1940s). Recently the grass beneath them has been mowed back and cleaned up removing any high grass or low bushes. This lot is considered to add to the significant setting of the church and is a contributory feature. = The Church of the Holy Innocents = The following is summarised from the 1989 Conservation Study by Noel Bell, Ridley Scott & Partners except where otherwise noted. It includes comparisons of the Church of the Holy Innocents with the available historical drawings of Carpenter's design for the Church of St John the Baptist, Cookham Dean that illustrate how Blacket reinterpreted and amended this design adding his own distinct flavour to the church. = Exterior = The Church of the Holy Innocents is a small rural church with a two-bay nave, a disproportionally large chancel/sanctuary, a north vestry, a south open timber porch, and a simple brick bell-cote at the western end of its steep shingled gabled roof. It is orientated in the traditional manner, east-west, with the sanctuary at the east end. The layout of the church is of the English type (rather than the antipodean) with the porch on the south side of the nave, the vestry on the north side of the chancel, and the pulpit in the northeast corner of the nave. Usually in Australia these features are on the opposite sides. The church is founded on clay or slate and is built on brick foundations. It features a sandstone plinth course with a chamfered weather which projects out from the walls. Above this is a slate damp proof course. The church walls are constructed of fine-quality red-blue mottle sandstock bricks within a soft lime mortar in English bond face brickwork. They are reinforced with engaged brick buttresses placed at all the corner returns and along the wall length at regular intervals. At sill height along the nave walls and the east wall of the chancel is a continuous projecting sandstone string course. The entire church also features sandstone tracery and trimmings on the doors, windows, and buttress caps. The brickwork at the top of the walling is corbelled out to form the eaves detail and support the thrust of the roof framing. Overall, the buttress and string courses of stone trim break the wall at regular intervals and create a pleasing contrast . The bricks used in the church construction are of a very regular gauge (230 x 65mm) showing that they are of good quality. The sandstone dressings on the building have been tooled to a very high standard, but the very fine grained sandstone if of an inferior quality. It was quarried locally at Cobbitty. The use of brick, highlighted with sandstone, to construct the church is illustrative of Blacket's adaption of the Cookham Dean design (which was built in stone) to suit local conditions. All six church windows are of a gothic style and feature elaborate stone tracery. The four nave windows and the single example in the vestry all have two lights and simple quatrefoil tracery in the heads. The large east chancel or sanctuary window is far more detailed with three lights and a very elaborate tracery panel (varied quatrefoil) and features a brightly coloured geometric glass design. This glass design was funded by the women of the parish in 1850. Research by Robin Hedditch suggests that the stained glass east window was likely locally made by a glazier using a restricted palettepalette of coloured stained glass. These types of windows are characterised by the use of plain, unpainted coloured (stained glass), a restricted colour palette, and simple geometric patterns favouring straight lines. During this period it was costly to import stained glass windows from Britain and there were no trained stained glass artists in the colony until the early 1840s. Consequently, many churches built during this time conquered this situation by employing a local glazier (lead and plumbing tradesmen) to make a \\"stained glass\\" window using local materials. These materials consisted of sheets of imported stained glass in a limited range of colours (generally crimson, purple, green, blue, yellow, and amber) that the glazier would cut into simple, non-figurative, geometric designs. This naive style was shortlived as by the 1850s the goldrushes brought wealth to the colony and the ability to commission windows from Britain or from newly arrived British trained stained glass artists. This research is ongoing and when completed could prove that this style of stained glass windows represents a rare, local response to the fashionable Gothic Revival movement by non-trained glass artists using locally available materials. This could mean that the east window is one of the earliest known surviving examples of \\"stained glass\\" in Australia while also being a rare example of naive 1840s locally-made stained glass windows. The east window is also likely an excellent example of this naive style as the local glazier when to great lengths to create a suitably rich, gothic design with the limited means available. The glazier was also largely successful in devising simple lead lines to showcase the rich, but limited, colour range of available stained glass. The design also appears to be attempting to emulate the highly prized \\"mosaic\\" effect that was a hallmark of Gothic Revival windows combined with a Victorian love of \\"crazy\\" design. The glazier's skills is also apparent in the use of clear glass in the background to highlight the bright colours and the repeating geometric pattern. This creates an effect of restless colour within a strong vertical repeating framework that is impressive within the church given its size and the east window being its main decorative object (submission provided by Robin Hedditch). Another element of the church design elaborated by Blacket is the well-shaped hood moulds terminating in an uncarved label stop which each window features. This is a common Blacket detail that was designed to allow the carving of bosses or decorative features in the future. Blacket's reinterpretation of the design is also evident in the internal form of the windows as each features chamfered stone reveals that follow the external gothic pointed arch. In contrast, the windows on Carpenter's drawings have revealing arches. All the church windows feature wire mesh security fittings on the exterior. One of the north windows in the nave and the vestry window have been modified and fitted with a small rectangular hinged section to allow air flow into the building. The church features three doors: two external and one internal. All are constructed of solid cedar (60mm thick) and are ledged and hung internally and close boarded externally and retain their original Gothic style hardware. The external arched porch entry door is of a double door type, and hung on hard forged decorative \\"gothic\\" strap hinges and features catches and a rim lock. It originally was grained in imitation of oak but is now painted. The single type external vestry door is of a similar design but is square headed. Due to its greater exposure to the elements this door is showing signs of weathering and is deteriorating. It appears to have had one panel replaced in the recent past in an unsympathetic manner. The single type interior arched vestry door is similar to the other doors, but its external face is different with it featuring alternating higher and lower panels (a ribbed design). Each of the gabled roofs of the church (nave, chancel, vestry, and porch) are pitched at 60 degrees in order to give perfect balance to the proportion of the wall below. The nave roof is the highest indicating its importance as the home of the congregation. Each of the three other roofs break down far below the line of the nave roof indicating their subordinate function. The roofs were originally covered in hardwood shingles, but those on the nave were replaced in the 1940s with asbestos shingles. The nave roof is capped with a rolled ridge capping and features a fine stone capped bell cote at its western end. The east end of the Nave roof originally featured a stone cross that was removed sometime after the 1970s. In contrast to Cookham Dean this bellcote is provided with added emphasis by being separated from the main wall plane by the gable verge. This change is further evidence of the refinement of the design by Blacket as he commonly used this design feature on smaller churches throughout his career. Otherwise the bell cote is in keeping with the Carpenter \\"Rural\\" church design of the church. The bell cote was restored in 1991 as part of works on the west facade.Peel, 1992 The hardwood (cedar) shingles covering the chancel, vestry, and porch roofs were removed during restoration work between 1991 and 1993 and replaced with hardwood \\"she oak\\" shakes.Peel, 1993 Unfortunately, this replacement lining on these roofs has now become weathered and is deteriorating. However, there are plans by the Diocese of Sydney to undertake conservation works in the near future. The chancel roof appears to be in good condition except for its guttering on the north side which has become dislodged at the east end and is caught on the vestry roof. The timber framed open porch is finely detailed and features a sharply pitched timber shingled roof and stone flagging. It leads straight into the southern entry of the nave. While today this feature is open its lower panels were originally filled in with cedar planking to make this structure half-open. It was completely restored in 1992‚Äì1993 which involved it being dismantled and rebuilt with any deteriorating elements being replaced with appropriate replacements. This restoration process also involved re- levelling and re-aligning the porch with the chancel entrance. This porch is different from the Carpenter drawings and marks another refinement or amendment of the design by Blacket. It is markedly different in terms of proportion (being far larger in relation to the church proportionally than its Cookham Dean counterpart) and is far less elaborate as it lacks the carvings and cusping of Cookham Dean. Comparatively this feature of the church is likely unique for this period (late 1840s) in NSW/Australia. = Internal = The church interior is generally plain or restrained in detail and economical in style, but is well proportioned and fitted out. Originally, the internal walls were lime washed and the stone window reveals bare, but both these surfaces have been painted in the recent past. The interior walls of the nave have also been rendered to create a dado to counteract rising damp. The exposed, stained, hammer beam truss roof ceiling and the dark Australian red cedar interior furnishings provide a pleasing contrast to the otherwise white interior of the church. This interior design of the church would have almost wholly been the responsibility of Blacket as the Cookham Dean drawings to not provide any details or instructions on how the church interior was fitted out. The entire interior space of the church is floored with sandstone flagging. On top of this in the nave are two banks of open timber seating on raised timber platforms. Open pews on raised timber boxes such as these are common in Blacket churches and are evident of his addition to Carpenter's design. This design also results in the centre of the nave featuring a narrow stone flagged aisle leading to the chancel. On the north and south sides of the nave exterior small modern ventilation holes have been created to air the space beneath these timber platforms. At the rear of the nave in the southwest corner is a large sandstone font designed in a fourteenth century style by Blacket directly adjacent the interior entrance from the porch. This beautifully carved feature has in the past been considered to be over elaborate when compared to the general plain and economical nature of the church interior. A simple Australian red cedar pulpit is located in the northeast corner on a raised sandstone platform and is accessed by possibly concrete steps (these may be a modern addition). The pulpit has been lowered sometime in the recent past by around 50 cm as indicated by marking on the surrounding walls. The nave contains several memorials fitted on to its walls including: An honour roll inscribed with the names of 23 men from the district who served in both World Wars (north wall). A marble plaque sacred to the memory of Lieutenant William Brown who fell at Mouguet, France, on 3 September 1916 (north wall). A marble plaque sacred to the memory of Henry Robert Lowe , born 2 November 1831 ‚Äì died 19 October 1880, of \\"Briling\\" Farm (east wall); and A marble plaque scared to the memory of Laura Lowe, born 1830 ‚Äì died 9 July 1902 (south wall). The chancel is separated from the nave by a brick chancel arch. This section of the church is narrower than the nave and two steps higher. The sanctuary is separated from the chancel by another step and a low cedar communion rail (sacred to the memory of Mr and Mrs A. V. McCann ‚Äì 1962). Within the sanctuary there is a decorative carved stone sedilia on its southern wall and decorative plaster dados on the walls. During the site inspection on 28 November 2016 a small range of furniture was arranged throughout the chancel and sanctuary, including four chairs, an alms box, a pray kneeler, and a rectangular timber altar along the east wall of the sanctuary, beneath the window. Generally the existing furniture, with the exception of the modern communion table, is similar to that described in Munro's accounts suggesting that they are original. In 1989 the original communion table was known to survive, but its location was not mentioned. As of 1989 the original High Victorian Gothic design communion set survived and was still in use. They comprised a solid silver Chalice and Pattern housed in a wooden carry case and were of English manufacture and possibly of an A. W. G. Pugin design. Within the chancel are also two small brass vases and a brass cross that lack any subscriptions and a book of common prayer scared to the memory of Charles Henry Thorsby. The alms dish, bible, and prayer book in the church are all thought to be original furnishings. The vestry opens off the north side of the chancel and during the site inspection (28 November 2016) was used partially as storage. It is decorated in the same manner as the nave and chancel, but its sandstone flagging appears to be subsiding in the northwest corner and the walls in the southwest corner have been water damaged from a leak in the roof. The church ceiling consists of a simplified hammer beam roof with close butted boarding and an arched brace and collar tie. This design is considered to be extremely fine and is evidently more elaborate than Carpenter's drawings indicating that it is another refinement of this design by Blacket. = Condition = As at 10 July 2017, The Church of the Holy Innocents retains most of its original fabric and has not been modified in an extensive manner. However, poor maintenance during the recent past has resulted in the deterioration of some of the wooden elements of the structure, such as the porch, chapel, and vestry roofs, and external vestry door. This has in turn resulted in some water and pest damage to the church interior, particularly along the south wall of the chancel and the southwest corner of the vestry. However, recent efforts by the Diocese of Sydney at improving maintenance of the church has enhanced its condition and there are plans to conduct restoration works on the church and its grounds in the near future. The Church of the Holy Innocents has good integrity and intactness as the majority of its original fabric is extant. The churchyard has fair integrity and intactness as it retains most of its original fabric, but is in need of maitenance works. The churchyard has only poor integrity and intactness as its boundary fence has been removed, although it still exists as an open space. = Modifications and dates = The Church of the Holy Innocents features no major modifications ‚Äì it is still largely original in form ‚Äì although there has been some small alterations to different aspects of the building (i.e. removal of stone cross on nave roof, lowering of the pulpit, replacement of the original cedar shingles on the nave roof with abestos shingles, etc.). Previously, there have been three renovation projects undertaken to restore the church: one in the late 1940s, one in the 1960s, and the other in the early 1990s. In 1946 prior to the celebrations for the centenary of the church a refurbishment project was undertaken. This involved restoring the roof, repairing the stone flagging, and re-varnishing the ceiling The third phase of restoration works proceeded on from the conservation study undertaken in 1989. It had identified several elements of the building that required urgent attention and consequently, between 1990 and 1993, work was undertaken to: * Replace damaged stonework on the bell turret; * Repair or replace damaged flashing; * Repair or replace damaged eaves material; * Repair the pointing to damaged brickwork to a high level; * Level the font to avoid further damage or collapse; and * Relay uneven stone flagging and remove cement pointing. These works were undertaken with the assistance of a financial grant from the Heritage Council (Heritage Assistance Program) and were conducted in a sympathetic manner. Until recently this item existed in an open rural setting, but the surrounding landscape has been progressively becoming semi-rural over the past few decades as development has extended along Bringelly Road associated with the proposed second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek.  Heritage listing  As at 28 July 2017, The Church of the Holy Innocents, churchyard, and cemetery is of state heritage significance because of its historical, associative, technical, aesthetic, research, rarity, and representative values. The church is the result of an unusual partnership of two prominent ecclesiastical architects: Richard Cromwell Carpenter, one of the leading English architects of the Cambridge Camden Society, and Edmund Blacket, the most prominent Australian ecclesiastical architect of the nineteenth century. It is the only church in NSW based on a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter and only one of three in Australia. This church is one of the earliest Gothic Revival churches in NSW recognised as being correct in its medieval detail and thus, an important, rare and representative example of this new wave of church architecture. Its highly detailed, Gothic Revival design renders it remarkable in a state context as a small rural church. The church is also designed according to the principles of the Tractarian Movement, facilitating a change in liturgical emphasis from the pulpit and the spoken word, to the altar and the sacraments associated with a separate choir. The application of a Tractarian design in this small rural church embodies wider debates within the Church of England under Bishop Broughton. The church is also strongly associated with the main group of proponents of the Gothic Revival and Tractarian Movements operating in, or in association with, the Church of England during the 1840s in NSW: Bishop Broughton, Edmund Blacket, Reverend Horatio Walsh, and Reverend George Vidal. The church, churchyard, cemetery, and archaeological site are associated with several important pieces of legislation relating to the governance and position of religion, and specifically the Church of England, in colonial society during the early nineteenth century. As such, these original features and the church land is able to tell a story about the changing nature of religion and the position of the Church of England in the early colony. The retention of the semi-rural nature of the church, churchyard, and cemetery into the twenty-first century also demonstrates the historic rural landscape and isolation that made the finely designed Gothic Revival Church of the Holy Innocents a remarkable and rare place of worship. Church of the Holy Innocents was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is of State historical significance due to its Tractarian design that forms an important early example of this type of architecture in NSW. Bishop Broughton's decision to use the English Tractarian design of Richard Cromwell Carpenter illustrates the progressive changes in the Church of England during this period associated with the Tractarian Movement and Cambridge Camden Society, which controversially promoted a change in liturgical emphasis from the pulpit and the spoken word to the altar and the sacraments associated with a separate choir. Through its design, this church reflects contemporary debates within the Church of England under Bishop Broughton. The Church of the Holy Innocents is an important early example of the Colonial Church's participation in the Gothic Revival movement, which was Empire wide in scope. The Gothic Revival movement, under the influence of Edmund Blacket, was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the colony for the majority of the nineteenth century. This item is of State historical significance as the site and its development materially demonstrate a range of early nineteenth century legislation related to church building, religious development, and the provision of education within the colony of NSW. The original small reserve for the church, cemetery, and school within the Cabramatta village reserve from 1825 is linked to the restructuring of the colonial surveying system carried out by Governor Brisbane. The archaeological remains of the slab timber church/school hall and the early portion of the cemetery are linked to the Clergy and School Lands Corporation (1826‚Äì1833), and the Church of the Holy Innocents and the land from the second land grant are linked to the 1836 Church Act. In this manner, the item illustrates the attempts by Colonial authorities during this period to develop and improve the colony's moral condition through the establishment of strong religious institutions that had a widespread presence throughout society. It also demonstrates the slow loss of pre-eminence of the Church of England in the colony during this period. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Church of the Holy Innocents and its stone font potentially have a strong historical association of State significance with Edmund Thomas Blacket (1817‚Äì1883), a prominent ecclesiastical architect renowned for his contributions to the Gothic Revival movement. As Diocesan Architect, Blacket adapted and executed Richard Cromwell Carpenter's design for the Church of the Holy Innocents, and he oversaw its construction as Diocese and then Colonial Architect. While it is still recognisably a rural \\"Carpenter\\" church, Blacket's elaboration of Carpenter's design is clearly apparent. This church belongs to the experimental period of Blacket's career when he was still developing his design repertoire and confidence in Gothic Revival architecture. It could be considered to be one of his early successes in Gothic Revival architecture as it has been described as \\"perfect a mediaeval replica as was ever realised in the colony\\". Blacket also designed the church's stone font, as well as potentially all the internal fittings and furniture. This item is one of the finest small rural churches Blacket built over his long career. The church is also strongly associated with the main group of proponents of the Gothic Revival and Tractarian Movements operating in, or in association with, the Church of England during the 1840s in NSW. This group included Bishop Broughton, the main promoter of the Gothic Revival; the Reverend Horatio Walsh a leading Tractarian in the Colonial church; Edmund Blacket, the leading architect of the Gothic Revival; and the Reverend George Vidal, the first minister of the church and a well-known Tractarian and promoter of the Gothic Revival. These clergy and architects encouraged the use of Carpenter's design for this church and oversaw its successful completion as part of a wider effort of promoting these two movements within the Church of England. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is of technical significance at a state level due to its Tractarian design which was cutting edge at the time. This design was approved by the Cambridge Camden Society, and prepared by one of their favoured architects, Richard Cromwell Carpenter. While many of the other churches Blacket designed early in his career were based on English designs in the same manner, they do not have the architectural precedents of the Church of the Holy Innocents, which is recognisably a \\"Carpenter\\" church embodying the principles of the Tractarian Movement. Thus, it is archetypal of the early stages in NSW of the Empire-wide Gothic Revival movement that was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the colony for the next several decades. Its architecture and its high level of detailing for a small rural church renders it exceptional within the state context ‚Äì the vast majority of small churches were built to vernacular designs with much less exacting attention to construction. Historically the Church of the Holy Innocents was also exceptional aesthetically for its rural location and picturesque backdrop that finely expressed its isolation, and made this a remarkable and rare place of worship. Over recent decades this rural landscape has been gradually developed to the stage that it is now semi-rural in nature, but the historic rural and isolated nature of this place is still appreciable at the site through the undeveloped lot to the north. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the only church associated with Richard Cromwell Carpenter within NSW, and only one of three in Australia, the Church of the Holy Innocents has great research potential within the context of Gothic Revival architecture, and the state's ecclesiastical architecture in general. It can also contribute positively to the study of the Tractarian Movement and High Church within the Church of England in the colony during the early nineteenth century. The archaeological site of the slab timber school/church hall potentially has good research potential due to its connection with the Clergy and School Lands Corporation. The corporation primarily built plain, cheap, and multi-purpose school/church buildings during its existence between 1826 and 1833 and reportedly only one of these is extant. This archaeological site potentially provides an important resource to investigate the simple wooden buildings erected during this program through any foundation remains or construction materials preserved at the site (post-holes, hearths, wall base slots, etc.). Through other occupational deposits (underfloor layers or rubbish pits) it also has the potential to provide information on activities undertaken within the structure throughout its lifetime. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is rare in NSW as an early small scale rural Gothic Revival church and a small rural church of a Tractarian design. It is also rare in the context of NSW ecclesiastical architecture as being the only church in NSW, and one of three in Australia, based on a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter. This design had been purposefully imported to the Colony by the adherents of the Tractarian movement to stimulate the construction of ecclesiastically correct churches in the Australian context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Church of the Holy Innocents is representative in the state context as a small rural church of Gothic Revival design of good integrity and intactness. It is representative of a well-designed and executed small rural church, innovative in its application of Tractarian design principles. Most other small rural churches of this period were of vernacular design. Its design is also representative of the early stages of the Gothic Revival and Tractarian Movements in the Church of England in the colony during the 1840s and the expression of the values and goals of these movements in the context of a small rural church.

Tax revenue is a primary constituent of the government's fiscal policy. The Government of Sri Lanka imposes taxes mainly of two types in the forms of direct taxes and indirect taxes. As of 2018 CBSL report, taxes are the most important revenue source for the government, contributing 89% of the revenue. The tax revenue to GDP ratio is just about 11.6 percent as of 2018, which is one of the lowest rates among the upper-middle income earning countries. At present, the government of Sri Lanka also face major challenges regarding the continuous budget deficits where government expenditures have exceeded the government tax revenue. Indirect taxes in the forms of excise duties, VAT and tariffs are the key contributors to the government tax revenue with 74% while direct taxes including income tax, Pay-as-you-earn tax and Economic Service Charge contribute only around 9%. However the tax regime is expected to witness major changes following the 2019 Sri Lankan presidential election which took place on 16 November 2019. The Maithripala Sirisena led government also announced that the carbon tax will be removed with immediate effect as of 1 December 2019. In November 2019, newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa approved mandate to abolish taxes such as PAYE, NBT, Withholding tax, Capital Gain tax, Bank Debit tax and to reduce VAT tax rate from 15% to 8%.  Income taxes  As of 2016, income tax contributes to 15% of the overall government tax revenue. The highest ever income tax proportion to the tax revenue was recorded at 35% in 2007. However the income tax contribution, started to decline from that point. The income taxes are collected by the Department of Inland Revenue under the provisions of Inland Revenue Act, no 24 of 2017. In addition to the income tax, PAYE tax is also charged by the Department of Inland Revenue in accordance with the terms of Section 114 of Inland Revenue Act no 10 of 2006 or Section 83 of the Inland Revenue Act No 24 of 2017.  VAT  VAT remained as the main contributor to the government revenue until 2014, later it was surpassed by the excise duty. VAT is imposed on mainly goods and services under the provisions of Act no 14 of 2002.  Excise duty  The tax became the most significant tax from 2015. It is imposed mainly on the production of drugs, alcohol, petroleum products and motor vehicles.  Tariffs  Until 2019, tariffs provided the third major contribution to the government tax revenue with nearly 20%. However in 2019, the Sri Lankan government implemented measures to curtail import expenditure and to promote exports inorder to avoid the trade deficit. Subsequently, the import levy imposed on the imports also reduced from 19% to 16%. Tariffs are highly imposed on imported motor vehicles at present. However Duty-free permit, a tax concession is also granted specially for the government officials to import vehicles into Sri Lanka.  Maral tax  Maral prevailed in Sri Lanka as a quite unpopular tax during the ancient times. It was imposed on the properties owned by those who were dead. The tax system was scrapped during the British rule in the country.  Complications and issues  Sri Lankan tax system is regarded as one of the most complicated tax structures in the world. Inefficiencies in the administration of taxes, social attitudes among general public about the tax system, lack of knowledge among the public on their obligation are some of the issues which have made severe problems to the government when financing the budgetary expenditures. In addition, the tax system of the country is also treated as inequal.

It is located in the region of Poniente Almeriense, about 14 kilometres from the city of Almer√≠a, along the national road (N-340a) and 14 km along the dual carriageway (A-7) In 2018, it had a population of 16176 inhabitants (INE), although during summer the population triples due to tourism, the main economic engine of the town.  History  The towns of Aguadulce, Las Hortichuelas and Campillo del Moro did not originally belong to the municipality of Roquetas de Mar, but they were added in the first third of the 20th century. The reason was that the Enix Town Council, to which these places belonged, proposed to cede to Roquetas de Mar if this municipality undertook the payment of the debits that Aguadulce had. This decision was communicated to the residents of Aguadulce, no claim was made, and on 24 June 1927 the Roquetas Town Council agreed to add this town with the proposed conditions. In the years 1928 and 1929 the boundaries were made, adding also a part of the municipality of V√≠car. However, in 1931 the Town Council of Enix, requested that the land previously ceded be returned, to which Roquetas agreed, but there was a protest from a resident of Aguadulce and in 1932 the Town Council of Roquetas agreed to rescind the decision taken in 1931. From then on, a series of disputes between the two municipalities followed. In Aguadulce it was not the same as in El Parador de las Hortichuelas, because its census was more significant. There were a few numbers of houses, having a bit more of 200 neighbours. The houses were on each side of the main road, but there were also some other streets perpendicular to this main street, and almost all of them were in direction to the mountain. There were some important houses, if we compare them with those of that time. These road houses, a rudimentary petrol pump, a grocery store and a chapel were the most characteristic of this locality. During the first third of the 20th century, modern means were incorporated, causing a change in the lifestyles of the population, such as the construction of a new road, means of communication: telephone, telegraph and transport, it took place the installation of the first bus line, and the first public lighting for electricity was hired in 1936 thanks to a workers society called ‚ÄúDesde la Buena Uni√≥n‚Äù, which in that year requested the change of the street lights. Aguadulce was more populated that El Parador, and although service were scarce, it had two schools and they celebrated their patron celebrations in honor of the Virgen del Carmen. In the summers, the population increased slightly due to the incipient tourism that began in those times. We must not forget that it was in Aguadulce were the influx of tourists began to arrive. In 1964 Aguadulce was declared the First National Interest Center of Spain. The few holidaymakers who arrived in this town did not stay in luxurious chalets or splendid mansions on the shore of the beach, but in modest houses that they rented or bought in the center of the neighbourhood, making on the shore of the beach a hut to enjoy sunbathing and sea bathing, and that once they finished the holidays they were disarmed until the next year. And so it went from having 27 houses and 300 inhabitants in 1950 to become the headquarters of a stable population that exceeds 15,000 inhabitants and that during the summer months the figure triplies, reaching about 45,000 people.  Demography  = Population evolution = Demography of Aguadulce  Transport and communications  By road, the Mediterranean Highway (A-7) connects Aguadulce with the rest of the province of Almeria and all Spain. In addition, the N-340a road runs through all the locality and connects it with the city of Almeria and with El Parador de las Hortichuelas, La Puebla de V√≠car, La Gangosa and Roquetas de Mar. The nearest airport is 25 km away. As for maritime communications, it has a marina and the commercial port of Almeria is 8 km away. It has no railway connection on its own, although the Almeria railway station is very close by and the buses can be taken at the same railway station connect continuously with Aguadulce.  Art, monuments and sites of interest  The archaeological site of La Ribera de Algaida or Ribera de Turaniana is a set of archaeological remains discovered in 1859 that chronologically cover from the end of the Bronze Age, through the Argaric culture, fundamental during Roman times, to the Muslim period. Is located along the coast. It occupies an area of between 12 and 13 hectares approximately. La Ribera de la Algaida was declared an Asset of Cultural Interest (BIC) with the category of Archaeological Zone by Decree 174/1991 on 17 September 1991, code 40790004, inscribed as \\"Archaeological Zone\\" (BOE number 249, page 33777, 17 October).

He was removed and executed by the Turks because he could not make the Crimeans fight in Persia. His conflict with the Turks was unusually violent. Ancestry and early life He was a son of Gazi II Giray (1588‚Äì1608). Gazi‚Äôs sons were, at least, Tokhtamy≈ü, Sefer, Inayet, Husam, Saadet and Aivaz. When Gazi died he appointed his son Toqtamƒ±≈ü Giray as khan. The Turks rejected this and appointed Sel√¢met I Giray (1608‚Äì1610). Tokhtamysh and his brother Sefer were killed by Selyamet‚Äôs men. The remaining brothers, Inayet, Husam, Saadet and Aivaz were sent to Turkey for safety. Members of the Giray family living in Turkey were potential replacements if the Turks chose to remove the ruling khan. Selyamet was followed by Janibek in 1610, Mehmed III Giray in 1623, and Janibek again in 1628. In 1635 Janibek was removed by the Turks. Inayet was chosen as his replacement with the support of Khan Temir. He promised to lead the Crimean army against Persia. Background From 1538 the Turks began demanding Crimean troops to fight in their wars. Crimeans would generally fight in the west but disliked fighting the Persians, apparently because of the long distance and lack of loot. In 1551, 1584 and 1628 (partly) khans were removed by the Turks for refusing to fight in Persia. This was the time of the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì1639). Also at this time the steppe warlord Khan Temir was very active and a problem for all his neighbors. A major event in this period was a shift in the nomadic population. In 1618 the Kalmyks began moving west and reached the Volga around 1630, a process that continued until, perhaps, the fall of 16351635 from Gaivoronsky,p200, without details.. They allied with the Russians in Astrakhan. As a result the Volga Nogais began moving west toward Crimea. The newcomers were settled on the steppes north of Perekop, greatly increasing the potential number of Crimean troops. Khan Temir tried to gain control of some of them, without much success. Reign In March 1635 Inayet and his brothers left for Crimea. After reaching the capital he spent several months getting to know the local nobles and organizing the Persian expedition. He appointed his brothers Husam and Saadat as kalga and nureddin. By fall his army was in Circassia. Since it was near the end of the campaigning season, he marched back to Crimea. Next spring (1636) ambassador Asan-Aga arrived from Istanbul. In the name of Murad IV, he demanded that the khan immediately lead 60000 Crimeans to Persia, otherwise threatening to execute Inayet and his brothers. Ships to transport them were sent to Balaklava. Inayet called a meeting and the nobles unanimously refused to go to Iran. When Inayet insisted the nobles bluntly told him that if he were removed, they could live with another khan. Several things made the problem worse. Khan Temir was to the north and might attack if troops left Crimea. In addition to the unusually violent threat, the ambassador had not brought the usual gifts and the Kaffa governor had refused Crimea the usual share of taxes. When the Crimeans would not budge the ambassador threatened to make the Crimeans pay a tax as if they were non-Muslim subjects. Given this final insult, Inayet called a kurultai Gaivoronsky, p203, without explanation. He does not seem to mention any previous kurultais, so this needs a fuller explanation. in which the khan, nobles and commoners all swore the resist the Turks. If they were defeated they swore to burn their houses and retire to the steppe. The ambassador left for Istanbul. Inayet now found himself in the same position as Mehmed III Giray in 1624 and 1628. He expected to be attacked by Khan Temir from the north and the Turks from the south. He did the obvious thing and took Kaffa by surprise. The first time the Crimeans took Kaffa was 1624 He executed the Turkish governor and appointed a Crimean governor for Kaffa and the whole south coast. The sultan was tied down by the Persian war so he sent an ambassador revoking the command to fight Persia and asked Inayet to go fight the Poles. Inayet assumed that they planned to invade when his troops were out of Crimea so he threw the ambassador in jail. The next problem was Khan Temir. Khan Temir rejected an offer of alliance. At some point Inayet had sent a letter to the Polish king suggesting friendship. In the summer of 1636 he sent another letter announcing his break with Turkey and offering a kind of subjection in return for a joint war against the Turks. Wladislaw IV had better sense, although, as usual, he would not necessarily restrain the Zaporozhians. Inayet offered to pay the Cossacks for help. They offered 5000 men but sent only 600 under ataman Pavel Bout. In January 1637 Inayet set out for Budjak. It is said that he had 150,000 Crimeans and Nogais, as opposed the Khan Temir‚Äôs 12000. Khan Temir had asked for Turkish support and received none. He told his men to make the best deal they could and fled south to Kiliya, where he stored his treasures, and then on to Istanbul. At Akkerman Inayet met the Budjaks under Urak, Salman Shah and the sons or brotherssons p208, brothers p209 of Khan Temir. The khan forgave them and told them to move east toward Crimea. He sent a letter to the Sultan threatening invasion if Khan Temir was not surrendered. Husam Giray captured Kiliya and returned with Khan Temir‚Äôs treasure. Murad IV first tried diplomacy. He said that he was not displeased with the removal of the Budjaks, would not dethrone Inayet and suggested that Inayet prove his prudence by going back to Crimea. In May he learned that the Turks were assembling a fleet, so he withdrew to Crimea. Inayet led the captured Budjaks eastward. He crossed the Dnieper and left his brothers Husam and Saadet in charge of the Budjaks. The brothers spent a few days feasting with the Budjak leaders at the Jan Kerman fortress. On the night before the Budjaks were to cross the river the brothers set up their tent on the edge of the camp. At dawn they were awakened by shouts and gunshots and found themselves surrounded. Salman Shah tried to restrain his men, but both brothers were cut down. The Crimeans from Jan Kerman could only bury the dead. On 13 June 1637 a Turkish fleet arrived at Kaffa. Along with janissaries was Inayet‚Äôs replacement, Bahadƒ±r I Giray. Inayet decided to give up. Gaivoronsky does not explain his decision. Although he had lost control of the Budjaks, they were disorganized and probably not a threat unless Khan Temir was released. If he still had 150,000 men he could have prevented an invasion, although he probably could not have captured the walled port of Kaffa. The gunpowder he had ordered from Poland had not arrived. Polish contemporaries thought that the loss of Husam and Saadet Giray was important (Gaivoronsky, footnote 49). Gaivoronsky does not say whether the Crimeans nobles would support him, something that must have been central. The Turkish re-capture of Kaffa is easily explained if the port was unfortified on the seaward side, which seems likely. Inayet probably hoped he would be exiled, even though the Turkish ambassador had threatened to execute him. The next day he sailed for Istanbul to explain himself to the sultan. On 1 July 1637 both Inayet and Khan Temir appeared before the sultan. Since he had captured Kaffa and Kiliya, killed a Turkish governor and threatened to attack Istanbul, he had no case. He was taken away and strangled. Inayet was given a proper funeral and buried at Aziz Eyub-Ansai in Istanbul. Khan Temir was sent away to be a governor of a province in Anatolia, but, nine days after Inayet, he was also strangled.

Much of his reign was spent dealing with Azov which had been captured by the Don Cossacks. Unlike many khans, he died of natural causes. He was the father of Selim I Giray and, through him, the ancestor of all khans who reigned after 1700 except for Devlet III. Early life and enthronement He was the son of Sel√¢met I Giray who reigned from 1608 to 1610. During his father‚Äôs reign he was sent to Turkey as a ‚Äòrekhin‚Äô or honorable hostage. He grew up on an estate near Yambol.Gaivoronsky, page 236 has the 'Balkan city Yanbol',which is probably an alternative spelling or misprint. He was described as handsome, learned, eloquent and something of a poet. In June 1637 the Turks deposed ƒ∞nayet Giray and placed Bahadir on the throne. As kalga and nureddin he chose the brothers Islyam and Safa Girai. Gaivoronsky, p 168 says Inayet was a cousin of khan Janibek and therefore a grandson of Devlet I. Islyam was captured by the Poles circa 1629 (p. 168) and released circa 1632 (p 179), but spent ‚Äòfive years‚Äô in Polish captivity (p. 233). Just after coming to the throne he learned that the Don Cossacks had captured Azov. Reign and Azov problem Azov, or Azak as it was then called, lies at the northeast corner of the Sea of Azov, at the mouth of the Don River. In 1471 the Turks captured it from the Genoese. They used it mainly to collect customs, control trade and to prevent the Don Cossacks from raiding into the Black Sea. Around 1630 the Kalmyks arrived from further east and drove many of the Nogais westward. This removed a screen that protected Azov from the Don Cossacks. In the spring of 1637, when ƒ∞nayet Giray was away fighting the Budjaks, the Don Cossacks besieged Azov. The garrison thought it was safe behind its walls, but the Cossacks dug a mine under the wall, filled it with gunpowder and blew it up. They burst through breach and killed everyone in the fort (28 June). The news reached Crimea just after Bahadir came to the throne. This was a major problem for all the neighboring powers. Some thought that it might be the beginning of a Russian push south similar the Russian capture of Astrakhan 81 years before. It also raised the possibility of a Russo-Turkish war, something that neither of the two powers wanted. The matter was complicated by the murder of Foma Kantakuzin. He was a Christian in the Ottoman service who was sent as an ambassador to Moscow. Like all such people, he travelled along the Don, where the Cossacks were expected to provide supplies and guards. He passed through just as the Cossacks were preparing their attack on Azov. He tried to warn the Turks and the Cossacks killed him. In September the Bahadir sent an army under Safa Giray to the Muscovite border. He did little damage but achieved the khan‚Äôs purpose of reminding the tsar that Crimea was dangerous. The tsar sent ambassadors to Crimea and Istanbul claiming that the Don Cossacks acted on their own, which was basically true, although Russia informally provided them with gunpower and other supplies. Sultan Murad, who was tied up with the siege of Bagdad, ordered the Crimeans to retake Azov. He also ordered them to send 10,000 soldiers to Armenia. The khan called a meeting of his nobles. There was no objection the eastern campaign, so Safa Giray left with part of the army Gaivoronsky does not say what Safa did. He was back in Crimea in 1639. The nobles objected that the Crimean horsemen could not take a walled fort without artillery and engineers. Since this was true, Bahadir chose a policy of diplomacy and delay. In the spring of 1638 ambassadors were sent to Azov, but the Cossacks refused to leave. Murad threatened to remove Bahadir. Toward the end of summer Piyale Pasha arrived with a fleet. The khan accompanied him to Azov where he cut off supplies from Russia but could do nothing with the fort without artillery. When winter approached, he returned to Crimea. In 1639 the same pattern threatened to repeat itself. Bahadir proposed to attack the Dnieper Cossacks since they were more dangerous than the Don Cossacks. Murad rejected this. Further delay was imposed by the Mansur conspiracy (below). As winter approached, the Azov campaign was put off until next year. Late in the year Murad ordered the khan to raid Poland and bring back at least 8000 slaves for the Turkish galleys. Kalga Islyam Giray obtained the required number near Kiev. Konetspolski pursued him but was stopped by snowstorms (February 1640). On this campaign Nureddin Safa Giray died. Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1623‚Äì1639) ended, thereby freeing up troops for Azov. In the spring of 1641 the Turks sent large forces Gaivoronsky, p 261 claims over 200,000 and 60,000 Crimeans, citing Cossack and Turkish sources. This needs to be checked against other sources. to Azov under Deli Hussein. Since there was now artillery the Crimeans had no objection to the campaign. By July they reached the Don. Deli Hussein first tried to storm the fort and lost hundreds of men. He then tried bombardment. Soon most of the walls and buildings were destroyed, but the ground was soft and trenches soon replaced walls. Both sides dug gunpowder- filled mines and blew them up. The Crimeans served mainly as a screen to prevent supplies from reaching the fort. The Turks began to run low on gunpowder. As autumn approached Bahadir announced that he was going home because the Crimeans could not winter on the steppe. If Crimeans could not endure a steppe winter then neither could janissaries, so Deli Hussein lifted the siege. Gaivoronsky's account differs in detail from other sources, so this may need to be checked. Bahadir, who had been growing ill for several years, died at Gozlev soon after returning to Crimea. Deli Hussein spent the winter in Kaffa, returned to Istanbul, and was not punished for his failure. In the spring of 1642 the tsar ordered the Don Cossacks to abandon Azov. (Azov was taken by Russia in 1694, lost in 1711 and finally taken in 1774.) Budjaks, Cossacks and the Mansur conspiracy At this time the Budzhak Horde was very active and a problem to all its neighbors. The sultan wanted them out of the way. In early 1637 Inayet Giray defeated them and led them east toward Crimea. They revolted, killed Inayet‚Äôs two brothers and returned to Budjak. Bahadir sent kalga Islyam Giray and Gulum Bey of the Mansurs to Akkerman to bring them back. Fearing punishment for the murders and lacking Turkish support, the horde offered to submit to Poland, its traditional enemy and victim. When the Poles did nothing they submitted and moved back toward Crimea. (1637 or 1638) The Zaporozhian Cossacks were growing increasingly disobedient to their Polish masters. In 1635 the Poles began building the Kodak Fortress near the head of the Dnieper rapids to control the Cossacks and block Crimean raids. Within a few months the place was destroyed by Cossack rebels. In the summer of 1637 the rebels chose Pavel Bout as their hetman, but he was soon defeated. The rebels gathered at Zaporozhye planning a new campaign. They appealed to Crimea, but the khan refused. A group of Nogais joined them. In the spring of 1638 a Polish army went to Zaporozhye and was defeated by the Nogais. The Poles eventually won, Kodak was restored and the rebellious Cossacks spread out, increasing the Cossack population east of the Dnieper. The Mansur clan held the northwestern steppe-like part of Crimea and had connections with the steppe peoples. Gulum, the Mansur bey, saw that the Budjaks were discontented and disorganized. Knowing that they had been good fighters under Khan Timur, in 1639 he began planning to take them over. To support this risky plan he made contact with the Azov Cossacks, who, in turn, were trying to gain support of the local Nogais. Bahadir soon learned what was going on. He invited the Budjak nobles to his palace and killed them all. Salman Shah and the last son of Khan Temir fled to the Volga nomads, but were sent back and killed. Safa Girai was sent to slaughter the Mansur leaders including Gulum bey. This coup was authorized by a fatwa from the Kaffa mufti, which implies the Bahadir had good evidence of a plot.

He is President of University Debating and Literary Club (UDLC) and instrumental in organizing AMU Literary Festivals. which is popular literary fest in north India. He is also Secretary of People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Aligarh Unit.  Stand on Indo-Palestine relations  Haque supports India's stand in favor of Palestine. In an interview, he said, India has opposed the creation of Israel right from the days of its freedom struggle. Tilting toward Israel will definitely isolate India from the Muslim world. We should know that the conflict between Israel and the Muslim world is inevitable because of Israel‚Äôs contempt for international resolutions and international law. India‚Äôs interest will be best served by Supporting Palestine‚Äôs legitimate aspirations.  Views on terrorism  He views terrorism as an act against Humanity. \\"An act of terror which involves the killing of innocent people is contrary to the spirit of Quran and Islam because the holy book itself declares that to kill one human life is to kill entire humanity, and to save one human life is to save entire humanity. (Quran, 5:32). Islamic militancy is a misnomer in another sense also. The so-called Islamic militancy has killed more Muslims than any other community. In fact the Muslims are the worst affected victim of terrorism.\\"  Views on nuclear weapons  Haque is of the view that the politics of maintaining monopoly over the nuclear weapons and other WMD's by the Nuclear Weapons States (NWS) is characterized by double standards and is counterproductive for nuclear weapons free-world. The fact is that the presence of large number of dreaded nuclear weapons in a turbulent world is a serious threat to the very existence of living creatures on our planet.

Education and career Salamon studied mathematician at the Leibniz University Hannover. In 1982 he earned his doctorate at the University of Bremen with dissertation On control and observation of neutral systems. (See control theory.) He subsequently spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematical Research Center at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, followed by one year at the Mathematical Research Institute at ETH Zurich. In 1986 he became a lecturer at the University of Warwick, where he was appointed full professor in 1994. The summer semester 1988 he spent as a visiting professor at the University of Bremen and the winter semester 1991 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. From 1998 to 2018 he was a full professor of mathematics at ETH Zurich, retiring as professor emeritus in 2018. Salamon's field of research is symplectic topology and related fields such as symplectic geometry. Symplectic topology is a relatively new field of mathematics that developed into an important branch of mathematics in the 1990s. Some important new techniques are Gromov's pseudoholomorphic curves, Floer homology, and Seiberg-Witten invariants on four-dimensional manifolds. In 1994 he was an Invited Speaker with talk Lagrangian intersections, 3-manifolds with boundary and the Atiyah-Floer conjecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Zurich. In 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2017 he received, with Dusa McDuff, the AMS Leroy P.

The name of the theory is derived from the philosophical concept mimesis (/m…™ÀàmiÀês…™s, m…ô-, ma…™-, -…ôs/;[1] Ancient Greek: ŒºŒØŒºŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ mƒ´mƒìsis, from ŒºŒπŒºŒµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ mƒ´meisthai, \\"to imitate\\"), which carries a wide range of meanings. In mimetic theory, mimesis refers to human desire, which Girard thought was not linear but the product of a mimetic process in which people imitate models who endow objects with value. Girard called this phenomenon mimetic desire. Girard described mimetic desire as the foundation of his theory: ‚ÄúMan is the creature who does not know what to desire, and he turns to others in order to make up his mind. We desire what others desire because we imitate their desires.‚Äù Girard, ‚ÄúGenerative Scapegoating,‚Äù in Robert G. Hammerton-Kelly, ed., Violent Origins: Walter Burkert, Ren√© Girard, and Jonathan Z. Smith on Ritual Killing and Cultural Formation, p. 122 Mimetic theory posits that mimetic desire leads to natural rivalry and eventually to scapegoating, which Girard called the scapegoat mechanism. In his study of history, Girard formed the hypothesis that societies unify their imitative desires around the destruction of a collectively agreed-upon scapegoat. The Colloquium on Violence & Religion is an international organization of scholars and practitioners interested in mimetic theory.  Bibliography  * Girard Ren√©. I See Satan Fall Like Lightning.

Biography Born in the city of Babol along the Caspian Sea, Bassari received a PhD in Persian language and literature and lectured at secondary schools in the Iranian capital Tehran. She was the first woman to be appointed as vice-chancellor of a university in Iran when she worked at the Jondishapur University in Ahvaz, during the 1960s. The university was instated in the 20th century by the Pahlavi dynasty to commemorate the ancient Sassanian academy of Gundeshapur. In the aftermath of the Islamic revolution in Iran and because of her Bahai faith, she was dismissed from her university position and eventually migrated to the United States. Bassari published extensive critiques on Persian literature including the national epic Shahnameh written by the celebrated Persian poet Ferdowsi. Her critiques have been listed by prominent Iranian historian Iraj Afshar as recommended descriptive reading surrounding the literature of Shahnameh. In 2018, she published a 347-page book titled Women of Shahnameh that studied the female characters in the epic. Each character is individually analysed and include Soudabeh the wife of the Shah Kay KƒÅvus, Tahmineh the wife of the protagonist Rostam, Gordafarid a champion who symbolised courage and hope to women, and Faranak, mother to Fereydoun who is a hero from the Kingdom of Varna. In 1967, she had also published a biography on Zandokht Shirazi, a pioneer in the feminist movement in Iran. She resided in New Jersey. She also worked on the editorial board of the New Jersey-based magazine, Persian Heritage. She identified as Bahai. Bassari also assisted in books on the life of the influential Persian Bahai poet T√°hirih, and contributed with Persian to English translations in academia. =Recognition= A portrait of her was amongst those exhibited at the Women of Persia art exhibit in Issaquah Highlands, Seattle, United States of America.

Having gained control of the Crimea after an attack on the country of the Russian army led by Field Marshal Burkhard Minikh and the resignation of Kaplan I Geray, the following year he faced the same problem as his predecessor: the Russians moved to Crimea again under the command of Field Marshal Peter Lassi. Despite a good combat training, Fetih II Gerai, due to the fragmentation of the army, could not protect the Crimea from invasion and it was repeated on a previous scale. He was removed from the throne. He died in 1746 in the city of Vise, where he was buried near a mosque. After two catastrophic failures of 1736 and 1737, the Ottoman government decided to return to power a man who had once proved his extraordinary abilities of the ruler - Mengli II Geray, who, after the resignation of Fetih II, was re-appointed khan.

The Ottoman government , seeing that a powerful uprising erupted in the Crimean Khanate, led by Kyrym Geray , popular among the people, and that the khan actually lost control of the situation, decided to remove Halim Geray. The failure of the khan was explained by the fact that, in his youth, distinguished by many virtues, he took the throne already as a sick old man and therefore was inactive. Halim Gerai settled in Saraj Eli (Turkey) and died there a year after his resignation.  Literature  * O. Gaivoronsky \\"Constellation Geraev\\" * O.

Life  Under Arslan Geray (1748‚Äì1756) he held the post of kalgi. The reign of Selim III Geray brought about major changes in the life of the Crimean Khanate. Reigning for the first time, Selim III convinced the Ottoman Sultan of the need to conclude peace with Austria for a joint confrontation between Russia , but was soon deprived of the khan's rank. In the first reign, Selim III Gerai appointed his brothers Mehmed Gerai and Kyrim Gerai as kalga and nureddin. In the second reign, Selim III appointed the kalga of his brother Mehmed Geray, and Nureddin - Kyrym Geray, the son of Khan Halim Geray. By his repeated return to the throne, the Ottoman Empire had already entered the war with Russia and was unable to protect its possessions in the Northern Black Sea region. Local Nogais, seeing the military superiority of the Russians, came out of obedience to the khan and Turkey, having sided with Russia. The proposal to leave the Turkish vassality came from St. Petersburg and the Crimea. Selim III Gerai refused the Russians and stopped all negotiations on this subject - and then in June 1771 the Russian army invaded the peninsula under the command of General-General-Chief Prince V. Dolgorukov . The Russian troops, having defeated the 70,000th army of the Crimean Khan, captured Perekop , and two weeks later, another 95,000th Tatar army was defeated in the battle of Kafa . Russian troops occupied the cities of Arabat, Kerch, Yenikale and Balaklava. Among the Crimean Beys and even among the Khan‚Äôs relatives, a pro-Russian party had already arisen by this time, and this, along with the unsuccessful Khan‚Äôs command, led to the fact that the enemy occupied the country in the shortest possible time. The Beysk assembly signed an alliance with Russia and decided from now on to elect the khan independently, which meant the country's exit from Ottoman rule and the independence of the khanate. Selim III Gerai initially obeyed the Beys' hope in the hope of a change in the situation, but soon, realizing his powerlessness to change something, abdicated and retired to Turkey. Selim III Gerai was remembered as a brave man, at the same time reproaching him for inaction and indecision. He died in 1786 in the city of Wiese.  Literature  * O.

Elected at the LWF 12th Assembly in Windhoek, Namibia 13 May 2017, Archbishop Panti Filibus is the 13th president and second from Africa to head Lutheran World Federation's highest authority established in 1947 to oversee the church with about 72 million members in 147 countries. After his election, he led a delegation of seven Regional Vice-presidents to meet Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church to strengthen relationship between the two churches. Archbishop Filibus told the Catholic pontiff that the past 50 years of improved relationship in worship had seen a departure ‚Äúfrom conflict to communion‚Äù. Pope Francis who had in 2015 participated in the Lutheran Church 500th anniversary of reformation in Sweden urged LWF delegation to continue on the road of reconciliation to full unity. In 2002, Filibus was the area secretary for Africa in the Department for Mission and Development (DMD) working with several churches under Mission Africa until 2010, when he was elevated to the position of Director of DMD. He was consecrated the first bishop of his local diocese of Mayo Belwa in Nigeria's north east state of Adamawa in 2013 after its creation at the peak of violent campaign against Christians by lslamist extremist Boko Haram that led to a forced closure of several churches in the area. In 2016, he was elected the Archbishop of the Nigeria church. Archbishop Filibus is noted for his humility, sympathy for the poor, commitment to interfaith relationship and peace, gender equality and spartan life style. For instance, in spite being the leader of the Lutheran World Federation, Filibus still maintains his small cathedral residence in Numan, north east Nigeria where there are frequent clashes between sedentary farmers and nomadic herders. In November 2017, dozens were reportedly killed in the area in a clash between farmers and herders but Filibus choose to stay helping victims of the attacks. His life style is a sharp contrast to many Nigerian clergy men who live in opulence flaunting private jets.  Humanitarian work  Archbishop Filibus is recognised as a strong voice against modern day slavery, human trafficking, irregular migration, oppression and injustice of all forms which is rife in his home country Nigeria and other African countries and helping those on the margin of society, weak and tired without a voice find voice and hope. In 2017 he led a joint effort of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria, LCCN and Lutheran World Federation, LWF to found a non-governmental organization ‚Äì Symbols of Hope whose focal objective is to create awareness against human trafficking and irregular migration especially of Nigerians traveling through Sahara Desert crossing Mediterranean Sea en-route Europe under inhuman conditions. Extreme poverty and internal conflict are cited as key factors that increase vulnerability to trafficking in Nigeria. Ranked 32 out of 167 countries according to the 2018 Global Slavery Index, Nigeria remains a source of transit and destination country for human trafficking. In August 2019, Archbishop Filibus launched interfaith network to bring people of different faith together to help victims of modern-day slavery find hope and confidence for the future.  Development of the church in Nigeria  Archbishop Filibus in February 2019 saw the need for the LCCN to have a standard media to serve its information needs, thus started Reformation Tabloid ‚Äì a monthly publication of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria to help spread the gospel through the print. The Newspaper was publicly unveiled by Nigerian Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo at the 2019 annual convention of the church in Demsa, Adawama state of Nigeria. At the same convention he flagged off the building of LCCN mega convention ground after obtaining approval from the government of Adamawa State. In May 2019 Dr Filibus launched a ‚Äòstrategic plan‚Äô for the development of the church in Nigeria. Archbishop Filibus in 2019 told a large gathering of LCCN that he was leading efforts to establish a University known as the Lutheran University of Nigeria (LUN) in Adamawa state, \\"to produce people with integrity, that would govern the country in future\\".  Climate change campaign  Archbishop Filibus is a climate change campaigner and desert encroachment ravaging northern Nigeria- an agriculture-heavy region. Filibus has often said the issue of climate change and desertification is very important to him and the Lutheran church and often uses the pulpit to enlighten locals on the impact of illegal logging, bush burning, use of woods as source of energy for domestic cooking on the environment while teaching them to adopt climate friendly activities such as planting of trees to protect the environment. During the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria, LCCN 2019 annual convention, Filibus in a major speech called on Nigerian government senior officials which included the vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the government of Nigeria, Boss Mustapha and Jubrila Bindow the governor of north eastern state of Adamawa who were present at the convention to convey the climate message to Nigerian government to speed up action against climate change and desertification in northern Nigeria to ease hardship. The economy of northern Nigeria largely depends on agriculture but many of them are peasant farmers and herders who have increasingly watched as their farmlands are encroached by desert, and crops and pastures get dried up causing more hardship to people who are already impoverished. Lake Chad which provides a source of livelihood to hundreds of agrarian communities has shrunk by 90 percent, going from 25,000 km2 in 1963 to less than 1,500 km2 in 2001. Climate change has been partly blamed for farmers-herders conflict in Nigeria due to struggle over diminishing land resources.

Not all of the residents of the hostel were taken from their families and the hostel accommodated many Aboriginal children from more remote parts of the region whose families paid for their stay there.  Background  St. Mary's Hostel was located on the Stuart Highway, just south of Alice Springs, and it was built on the site of the Lady Gowrie Rest Home for Service Women which was in operation during World War II. Following the war it was purchased cheaply by the Australian Board of Missions (higher tenders were received for the property) and named St. Mary's Church of England Hostel (most often simply referred to as St. Mary's). The first superintendent of the hostel, Sister Eileen Heath, arrived in Alice Springs with her friend, Lillian Schroder, who would serve as the housekeeper and seamstress. They welcomed their first residents on 2 March 1946, four children (two girls and two boys) from Newcastle Waters Station and from there the numbers continued to grow. Eight months later there were 18 children. In January 1949, a major event in the life of the hostel was Heath travelling to Mulgoa NSW, to 'bring back' some of the women and children who had been evacuated there during the war (1942); many of the evacuees chose to stay but Heath made the return journey with 3 children and 9 children and re-settled at St. Mary's. In 1953 film director Charles Chauvel visited St. Mary's (for the second time) during an exhaustive search for his lead and \\"discovered\\" Ngarla Kunoth (Rosalie Kunoth-Monks) who he cast as the title role in Jedda. Records are available of all residents of St. Mary's in 1953 that give an \\"undated list of inmates\\" showing that, of the 71 students, 31 were wards of the Native Affairs Branch. In addition to this, there are 6 \\"working girls\\" listed; women who worked in Alice Springs and paid board at the hostel. The second superintendent of the hostel was Captain, later Reverend, Colin Steep who worked there from 1956 - 1959 and it is he who struck up a friendship with Robert Czak√≥, a Hungarian artist, who he allowed and supported to paint the Robert Czak√≥ Mural at the onsite chapel. This mural depicts biblical themes and was heritage listed in 2014. The final two superintendents were Archdeacon Bott (1962 - 1966) and Bob Gaff (1971 - 1972). Bob Gaff continued as superintendent when the home closed and became St Mary's Children's Village. In 2016 Archbishop Freier claimed that the hostel had been \\"appropriated\\" by the post-war government to wrongfully remove children from their families and said that the Anglican Church:  St. Mary's Hostel residents  * Freda Glynn, co-founder of CAAMA * Pat Ansell-Dodds, artist, elder and lecturer * Rona Glynn, first Indigenous teacher and nurse in Alice Springs * Rosalie Kunoth-Monks, actress, Aboriginal activist and politician * Tony Liddle, truck driver and Aboriginal activist  Alternate names  * Mount Blatherskite Hostel * St Mary's Church of England Home * St Mary's Home for Children  References   External links  * Find and Connect; \\"St Mary's Hostel (1947 - 1972)\\" * Centre for Indigenous Family History; \\"St Mary's Hostel, Alice Springs\\" * National Archives of Australia; Tracking Family: A Guide to Aboriginal Records Relating to the Northern Territory Category:Child-related organisations in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Alice Springs ","title":"St. Mary's Hostel (Alice Springs)"},{"id":"62247296","text":"Aloysius Chen Guodi (; 7 November 1875 - 9 March 1930) was a Chinese Catholic priest and Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fenyang from 1926 to 1930 until his death.

The eldest son of Tsarevich Akhmed Geray (d. 1750) and the grandson of the Crimean Khan Devlet II Geray .  Life  In 1777, Prince Bahadir Gerai became the leader of the Abaza people. In 1781, he was appointed and approved by his brother, the Crimean Khan Shahin Gerai, seraskir of the Edichkul horde. Ruling since 1777, Khan Shahin Gerai carried out pro-Russian radical reforms in Crimea, in particular, equalizing Muslim and non-Muslim populations. Reforms were extremely unpopular, and in 1781 led to an uprising that began in the Kuban and quickly spread to the Crimea. By July 1782, an uprising completely swept the entire peninsula, the khan was forced to flee, and his administration officials, who had not managed to escape, were killed. At the center of the uprising were the brothers Shakhin, princes Bahadir Gerai and Arslan Gerai . Bahadir Gerai was elected khan and is considered the last independent Crimean khan, since the short reign of Shakhin after him was a puppet character. Bahadir Gerai appointed his younger brother Arslan Gerai as a kalga-sultan. The new Crimean government applied for recognition to the Ottoman and Russian empires. The first refused to recognize the new khan, and the second sent troops to crush the uprising. The troops were commanded in the Crimea by Anton Bogdanovich Balmen , and in the Kuban by Alexander Vasilievich Suvorov. By November 1782, the uprising was completely crushed, most of Bahadir's supporters through the North Caucasus went to Turkey, and Bahadir himself was captured and was imprisoned in Kherson. In 1783, he managed to escape to the Caucasus , and since 1789 he lived in Turkey. He died in Turkey on his estate in 1791 near Istanbul.  Sources  * Gaivoronsky Alex.

Life In 1910, after the death of his father, Muhammad Rahim Khan II, Isfandiyar Khan came to power in Khiva. Unlike his father, he did not have many special talents. Initially, the enlightened vizier Islam Khodja played a large role in the running of the state. Using his money, a cotton gin plant, a hospital, a post mail, a telegraph and a secular school was built. Between 1908 and 1910, Islam Khodja built an emsemble of buildings in the Southeast of Itchan Kala, consisting of the smallest madrasa and the largest minaret of Khiva. Islam Khodja was later killed without Isfandiyar Khan's consent. Tsar Nicholas II awarded Isfandiyar Khan with the Orders of Saint Stanislaus and Saint Anna. In 1910, Isfandiyar was awarded the title of Major-General of the Russian Empire. In 1911, he was enrolled in the Tsar's retinue. In 1913, he received the title of Royal Highness from the Tsar. In 1912 the Khanate of Khiva faced a revolt by Yomud Turkomans. It ended in 1913. The February Revolution in Russia influenced the Khanate of Khiva. On April 5th, 1917, the Young Khivans presented Isfandiyar Khan with demands for reform. The Khan was forced to publish a manifesto in which he promised to create a representative body - the Majlis, which also included members of the Young Khivans. The power of the Khan was limited by this document. The chairman of the Majlis was Young Khivan politician Boboahun Salimov. However, as Isfandiyar was a conservative, he hindered the reforms as much as he could. Many were dissatisfied with Isfandiyar Khan's actions, especially after the October Revolution, when Khivans learned about the reforms in Russia. Eventually, the political situation escalated to the point where reactionary forces took over. As a result, the Young Khiva government was overthrown and all the reforms Isfandiyar Khan announced were cancelled.–ì—É–ª–æ–º–æ–≤ –•. –ì. –î–∏–ø–ª–æ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤ –°—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –ê–∑–∏–∏ —Å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–µ–π –≤ XVIII ‚Äî –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–æ–≤–∏–Ω–µ XIX –≤–µ–∫–∞. ‚Äî –¢–∞—à–∫–µ–Ω—Ç, 2005.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –£–∑–±–µ–∫–∏—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞. –¢. 3. ‚Äî –¢–∞—à–∫–µ–Ω—Ç, 1993. However, the leader of the Turkmen Yomud tribe, Junaid Khan, had returned to Khiva. He launched a coup in Spring 1918 and was appointed commander of the armed forces of the Khanate, and took power almost effortlessly, soon concentrating all the power in his hands. With Isfandiyar Khan executed by Junaid Khan in the palace of Narallabay, his relative, Sayid Abdullah, became Khan. Cultural Policies During the reign of Isfandiyar Khan, new madrasas and mosques were built in Khiva. In 1912, he built the complex of Narallabay Palace (also known as the Isfandiyar Palace), in the form of a separate building which housed several ceremonial halls in rooms of various shapes. Among them, there was the throne room, built and decorated in a modern Russian style. Isfandiyar Khan ordered many elements of the new building from the St. Petersburg Imperial Porcelain Factory. Photographer and first Uzbek film director Khudaibergen Devanov shot the first documentary in Uzbek about Isfandiyar Khan with his heir riding in the front of a car in 1910. Together with the Emir of Bukhara Mohammed Alim Khan, Isfandiyar Khan took part in the opening of the Saint Petersburg Mosque on February 22nd, 1913.¬´–°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–µ–¥–æ–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏¬ª, 23 —Ñ–µ–≤—Ä–∞–ª—è (8 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞) 1913, ‚Ññ 44, —Å—Ç—Ä. 3 Gallery File:Said Isfandiyarkhan.jpgPortrait of Isfandiyar Khan File:Isfandiyar Jurji Bahadur (Gorskii 20154u).jpgIsfandiyar Khan in St. Petersburg S.M.

Hassan Isfahani Karbalyi was a student of Mirza Shirazi, who wrote this book at the request of Muhammad Hossein Naini, about the events of Tobacco Protest in 1892 AD (1271 SH, 1310 AH). The second edition of Tarikhe Dokhanieh was published in Iran in 1998 after being revised by Rasoul Jafarian, who also wrote an introduction to the book. In 2003, Jafarian again edited and re-published the text.  Hassan Isfahani  Isfahani also known as Hassan Isfahani Karbalyi, is the author of Tarikhe Dokhanieh. He was a distinguished scholar among Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi and Ayatollah Ismail as- Sadr's students. He emigrated to Samarra around 1883 AD (1300 AH, 1261 SH), and attended Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi's lectures, mapping his lessons in Jurisprudence (Fiqh) and Principles of Islamic jurisprudence. He completed the compilation of the Tarikhe Dokhanieh in 1892 AD (1310 AH, 1271 SH). He stayed in Samarra until the death of Mirza Shirzai, then returned to Karbala in 1896 AD (1314 AH, 1275 SH) and became Ismail as-Sadr's student.ÿ®ÿ∫€åŸá ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿëÿßÿ∫ÿ®€åŸÜÿå ÿ™ÿßÿ±€åÿÆ ÿØÿÆÿßŸÜ€åŸá He died in Kadhimiya and was buried there on 1 June 1904 AD (1322 AH, 1283 SH). His masters included Seyed Mohammad Esfahani, Sheikh Fazlollah Noori and Sayyed Muhammad Tabatabai Fesharaki. Hassan and Muhammad Hossein Naini were close friends. At that time, Hassan was a prominent mujtahid but not conversant as Naini. Naini told him to write Tarikhe Dokhanieh, among the most comprehensive books on this subject. After Hassan's death, Naini took charge of his family.

History =Colonial period= The first Jews arriving to Costa Rica were mostly Sephardic Jews from Spain escaping persecution. Most of them New Christians and marranos. Although some may have been crypto-Jewish it's impossible to know how many were Roman Catholics and how many weren't. As part of the Spanish Empire the Spanish Inquisition was in place in the province of Costa Rica, however there's no registry of any Jew ever to have been trialed or executed, as the only registry of an Inquisition trial in Costa Rica was against a couple of young women accused of Witchcraft who were absolved. =Independence= After gaining independence the first Costa Rican Constitution, the Pact of Concord of 1821 established the Catholic religion as the mandatory religion (not only official but compulsory) banning all other creeds for the citizens of Costa Rica and only allowing the practice of other religions for foreigners who were temporary in the country. This, of course, affected the Jews already living in the country who had to practice their religion in secret, inspiring the myth of the \\"witches of Escaz√∫\\". Escaz√∫ had one of the largest Jewish communities and the Jewish rites (using black clothes and speaking in \\"strange languages\\" [Hebrew] among other things made some observers to think that it was some sort of magical ritual). However freedom of religion was established in the following Constitution, 1925's Fundamental Law of the State of Costa Rica as in the Federal Republic of Central America in general of which the State of Costa Rica was a member, allowing Jews to practice freely. =First Republic= Successive migration from Sephardic Jews from places like Curacao, Panama and Jamaica faced relative tranquility, though Jews didn't had their own graveyard and Sephardic Jews were buried (alongside Protestants, Muslims, Bah√° º√≠s and other minorities) in the Foreigners‚Äô Cemetery, a practice that continues to this date.Guzm√°n Stein, Miguel. La migraci√≥n sefardita en Costa Rica y la lapidaria f√∫nebre como fuente de investigaci√≥n de una comunidad in√©dita V Congreso Centroamericano de Historia. 19 de julio de 2000. After the foundation of Freemasonry in Costa Rica anti-Masonic publications mostly from the Church also associated Masonry with Judaism, as did the publication of the anti- Masonic Catholic party, the Catholic Union in 1891 accusing it of being the \\"flesh and bones of Talmudism\\". The first major waves of Jewish migrations came in the late 19th century and early 20th century mainly from Ashkenazi Polish Jews who did not mix with the Sephardic. These migratory waves escaping the European anti-Semitism and the rise of Nazism were controversial in the Costa Rican society and caused heated debates in the press, producing also a large number of anti-Semitic articles and the births of far-right anti-Semitic groups like the Patriotic Union and the Anti-Jewish Committee. Anti-Semitic laws were enacted during President Le√≥n Cort√©s Castro's administration. Cort√©s was a well known anti-Semite and Fascist sympathizer. Future president Otilio Ulate also spread anti-Semitic canards in his own newspaper even accusing Jews of poisoning the milk of children and was a prominent anti-Semite. =World War II= During the interwar period the NSDAP/AO tried the nazification of the Costa Rican German community. The Nazi Party of Costa Rica existed at the time lead by engineer Max Effinger, who would be a minister in Cortes' cabinet. The issue split the German community among pro and anti-Nazis. Cortes' successor, Dr. Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Guardia, has also being accused of anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic ideas, however Calder√≥n was closer to Spanish National Catholicism than any form of Fascism and was loyal to the United States even visiting the White House during his tenure. After the Pearl Harbor attack Calder√≥n declared war on Germany and aligned the country with the Allies following a persecution of Germans, Italians and Japanese (including Effinger who was deported to the United States although release after the war). However most laws limiting the rights of Jews were kept in place until Calder√≥n successor's presidency, Teodoro Picado Michalski, himself son of a Polish mother and thus friendly toward the Polish Jewish community. The outbreak of the Costa Rican Civil War after the 1948 election in which Otilio Ulate was the alleged winner split the country in two sides; opponents and supporters of the government. The Jewish community was seen as pro-government whilst Germans and Italians were overwhelmingly anti-Calder√≥n due to the persecutions. After the triumph of rebel forces the Synagogue of San Jos√© was set on fire, but no more anti-Semitic attacks happened in part due to the opposition of war caudillo Jos√© Figueres. =Second Republic= Most of post‚Äì48 period of Costa Rica was characterized by its political stability. The country developed a two-party system between the center-left Figueristas and center-right Calderonistas and in general avoided the extremes with both far- left and far-right parties receiving testimonial results. Costa Rica (as a founding member of the United Nations) was also one of the countries that voted in favor of the creation of Israel and for many years was alongside El Salvador one of the only two countries with the embassy in Jerusalem and not Tel Aviv. During the Cold war period the far-right Free Costa Rica Movement was born and active, with a strong paramilitary anti-leftist organization. Although some members of the group were openly anti-Zionist others were simply Conservative and Libertarian hardliners whose anti-Communism was not mixed with anti-Jewish ideas. Controversies regarding Luis Fishman's Jewishness arise during the 2002 Costa Rican general election when presidential candidate Abel Pacheco de la Espriella separated Fishman as his running mate in the presidential ticket. Fishman accused Pacheco and his team of making anti- Semitic comments. On the 2010‚Äì2014 period, then deputy Manrique Oviedo of the Citizens' Action Party (although he later defected to National Restoration) accused then Vice President Luis Liberman of using his influence for benefiting fellow Jewish. And in 2019 anti-establishment right-wing candidate Juan Diego Castro generated uproar due to his video making accusation against businessman and newspaper owner Leonel Baruch, of Jewish origin, calling him \\"evil banker\\" and mocking the Holocaust. Anti-semitic comments have been reported in social media including against Eli√©cer Feinzaig, president of the Liberal Progressive Party and of Jewish religion. =21st century and rise of Neo-nazism= Around the early 2000s the so call National Socialist Party of Costa Rica was founded, mainly as a fringe neo-Nazi group, accused of minor violent hate crimes and vandalism, but with little to non impact in Costa Rican politics aside from the media coverage. Some other minor neo-Nazi groups also appeared with mostly online activity. In 2012 a police officer identify as Ronald \\"Murdock\\" Herrera Borges came into the spotlight for his association with Nazism and being openly neo-Nazi. Herrera was fired from the police and committed suicide a few years later. In 2015 the Simon Wiesenthal Center denounced that shops selling Holocaust denial literature and Nazi symbols existed in San Jos√©. In 2018 an anti-immigration rally was controversial due to the presence of neo-Nazis in it using Swastikas and Nazi salutes and administrating far-right Facebook pages that spread xenophobic material and Fake news. Several far-right organization were dismantled during the 2019 including a terrorist group that owned one of these pages named Resistencia Costarricense (Costa Rican Resistance).  Data and analysis  A 2009 poll measuring the perception of Jews in Costa Rica showed that 32% of Costa Rican have a positive view of the Jews, whilst 29% have a negative and 38% have neither. 8% of Costa Rican considered Jews to be honest citizens, 10% considered that they help each other, 4.7% considered that they help the economy, 4.5% believed they respect the family and 4.8% that they have a clear identity. 7.5% of Costa Ricans believed that Jews discriminate non-Jews, 6.5% believed they exploit who works for them, 11% that they know how to handle money and 4% believed they disrespect the Christian faith. Negative ideas were more prominent among men than women. Only 1.3% expressed they distrusted Jews (the most distrusted group was that of the Colombian immigrants at 34%), and only 0.5% expressed that they have a problem with Judaism as a religion (65% expressed no problem with any religion), 67% expressed no problem with Jewish institutions, 13% express a little of discomfort and only 7% expressed a lot of discomfort. 37% thought that Jews should be more loyal to Costa Rica than to Israel, and 35% were indifferent if they were. 41% of Ticos answered that they think the Jews killed Christ or took part in his death, whilst 37% do not answer and 21% think the Jews were not responsible.

The 303rd episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on November 6th, 2019. The episode parodies Donald Trump‚Äôs victimization tactics, as well as media censorship in China, ICE detention centers and the 2019 film Joker, continuing from previous episodes in the season. Plot As marijuana farmer Randy Marsh and his partner Towelie are broadcasting a podcast about Tegridy Farms, police interrupt the broadcast and take away Randy, taking him to the South Park City Council. Mayor McDaniels and the council tell Randy that the Tweaks have brought video footage proving that Randy was responsible for blowing up local marijuana farms in the episode \\"Mexican Joker\\". This footage, along with other examples of Randy's behavior over the course of the episodes of the past few weeks, leave McDaniels no choice but to have Randy arrested and put in jail. When Randy's wife Sharon breaks the news to their children Stan and Shelly, they are all giddy as they realize that this may be the opportunity they have wanted to leave the farm and return to normal lives in South Park. As a group of children play football in the park, fourth-grader Eric Cartman throws a pass to Jason White, but when Jason runs into the street to catch the pass, he is run over by a police car and killed. Father Maxi leads the funeral service for Jason at the church and he brings up Jason's father Robert White (who was introduced in the episode \\"Splatty Tomato\\"). Robert expresses his frustration at the lack of people who have arrived to mourn for Jason and his ongoing belief that no one cares about the Whites. At the White House, President Herbert Garrison receives a call from Randy in jail as Randy asks Garrison for help. Randy visits the jail's infirmary and complains that he is starting to feel remorse for his actions as he no longer has access to his marijuana. While there, he attempts to use a technique of blame reversal taught to him by Garrison, but it is rejected since he is not the President. Gerald and Sheila Broflovski bring a lasagna to a party being held at Tegridy Farms as the Marsh family celebrates. When the Whites arrive, Robert is angry that no one brought food or properly mourned for Jason, and he is upset about the impending demise of Tegridy Farms as he was a loyal customer. When the Whites leave, Cartman runs after them and suggests to them that they consider adopting a child that has been abandoned at one of the ICE detention centers, where Cartman had previously seen children in need. The Whites look at several children who are displayed similar to animals in an animal shelter, and decide to adopt a \\"pure-bred Mexican\\". The White family names the boy Alejandro, and share with him their feelings about how everyone else will not care about the Whites and that he will experience this for himself. As they watch television, President Garrison and his attorney Rudy Giuliani speak out against the charges made against Randy Marsh and call on people to make their voices louder. Robert promises to take action for his family, while at the same time disciplining Alejandro for attempting to make a call to Mexico on a cellular phone after 7 pm, their designated cutoff time for phone usage. When Alejandro refuses to join the Whites in a protest in support of Randy, the Whites decide to get Alejandro his own child to adopt from an ICE detention center. Their continued discipline of Alejandro along with responding to all of his Spanish statements with \\"Bien, gracias, ¬øy t√∫?\\" (translating to \\"Good, thanks, and you?\\") makes Alejandro grow increasingly angry. In a therapy session in jail, Randy shares that his moral values are lower due to him comparing his values to that of the President, and that as long as his values were better than the President's, he should be okay. Randy is later visited in jail by Giuliani who gives Randy a marijuana cigarette. Randy's arraignment begins and most of the citizens of South Park arrive in support of Randy being convicted, chanting \\"lock him up\\". The Whites are the only ones who are protesting in support of Randy. As Randy begins to use a defense given to him by Garrison and Giuliani, who are also present at the arraignment, he gives up on their defense strategy. He states that the marijuana given to him by Giuliani was poor quality, and it reminded him of why he got into marijuana farming in the first place. As Randy extols the virtues of his marijuana farming, a series of explosions occur outside. Alejandro, who now has his face covered in white sunscreen put on him by Robert, is on a rampage of destruction in the town, and the police believe he is now the Mexican Joker. They attempt to shoot Alejandro but he escapes. Randy is exonerated of all charges and solely thanks the Whites for their support. At Tegridy Farms, snow begins to fall as Randy tells his family that this year's marijuana farming season has now ended due to the colder weather.

Reception Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, praising how the episode managed to tie loose ends in a satisfying way, and explaining, \\"It may not actually be the season finale, but this South Park episode succeeds in bringing together a number of ongoing plot threads and bringing the Tegridy Farms saga to a close. Some of the material involving the White family grows repetitive, but this is still one of the stronger chapters of Season 23 so far.\\" John Hugar of The A.V.

The current geographical area of the panchayat is 18.66 km2 . Though 70% of people in the panchyat depends upon agriculture, the income source is overseas jobs.  History  Vengara panchayat is situated 16 km away from Malappuram district headquarters. There were separate panchayats existed between 1954‚Äì55 in the Valiyora and Kannamangalam portions of the Malabar District Board. There were no elections conducted for president of panchayat during that time. The panchayat president was elected by the voters by raising their hands. = Formation of Panchayat = Vengara panchayat was constituted in 1961 December 11 by including Vengara , Kannamangalam villages and by merging Valiyora and Kannamangalam panchayats. This was headquartered at Vengara. There were 11 wards at the initial time. The first election was in 1964. Shri. Chakkeri Ahmed Kutti Sahib who was later became the Minister of Education in Government of Kerala served as the first president. = Partition = For many geographical and demographic reasons, the development process of Vengara Panchayat was more in Vengara when comparing to other places in the panchayat. Due to the low population density of Kannamangalam, it did not achieve significant development until 1995. Due to this, government divided this panchayat into Vengara and Kannamangalam in 2000 December 2. In the next election, Shri. Kallan Muhammed and Shri. K Saitalavi was elected as the President and vice president respectively.  First governing body  The first governing body was elected for 1964‚Äì69 years.

Several persons worked for the education here. The most prominent among them were Chakkiri Ahmed Kutti. = History of education = Until 1958, there were only 13 LP schools with 5th standard and one higher elementary school with 8th standard in the panchayat. The first Kerala government led by E. M. S. Namboodiripad granted a high school to Vengara in 1958. Due to the lack of suitable space to build a school in Vengara this school was set up in Neduparamba in Orakam Panchayath. This school is still known as Vengara school. = Educational institutions = There are six LP schools, four UP schools, one Higher Secondary School and one Vocational Higher Secondary School in Vengara Panchayath. Out of these, one LP school, two UP schools and one vocational higher secondary school are in the government sector. The rest are under private management.

The sect incorporates some aspects of Christianity with those of traditional Kikuyu religious beliefs. The sect was officially registered in 1959. However, it traces its origins between the years 1926 - 1930 in Limuru, Kiambu County, Central Kenya.  History  The origin of the word akurinu is not clear. It is said by some to come from the Kikuyu question ‚ÄòMukuri-ni‚Äô which translates to ‚Äòwho is the redeemer?‚Äô. Others say that it comes from the growling sounds made by early adherents to the sect when possessed by the spirit, an act described as gukurina. In his book Facing Mt. Kenya, Jomo Kenyatta states that the akurinu referred to themselves as Arothi, people of God. The akurinu identify Joseph Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa as the founder of the sect. It was Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa who ascended Mt. Kenya (then known as Mt. Kirinyaga) with the first four akurinu prophets - Joseph Kanini, Henry Maina, Philip Mukubwa and Lilian Njeru. It was on this ascension that the akurinu say Njeru was instructed to remove all adornments she had worn, throw them into the River Nyamindi and cover her hair. They also claim to have been instructed by God to lift their hands in the air as they pray. These two practices form an integral part of akurinu religious beliefs today. Henry Maina is credited with composing most of the 544 hymns in the akurinu hymn book. It is said that he was given the gift of music by God on condition that he would not marry. However, after marrying a woman from Nyahururu, he lost his musical prowess. His name was replaced by that of David Ikegu in the Akurinu New Testament. In the 1950s at the height of tension between the British colonial government and natives, the movement came under heavy suppression from the colonial government which was opposed to any indigenous religious movement. Joseph Ng‚Äôang‚Äôa was shot dead on 2nd February 1934 by British soldiers while praying in a cave.  Differences with Mainstream Christianity  Adherents to the sect are known to be reserved about their religious beliefs and do not interact freely with non-Akurinu. They are conspicuous in their white robes and turbans as their scripture dictates that they should discard all forms of European dressing. The white turban is also meant to show that they are peace- makers. These are some of the main differences between the akurinu sect and mainstream Christianity. * They believe in the third person of the trinity and place him above God the father and the son. * Elders seclude themselves for 7-14 days before any important event. * Akurinu men are not allowed to marry before attaining the age of 25. For women, the minimum age limit for marriage is 22. This is however more of a guideline than a rule. * Consumption of alcohol is forbidden * They do not believe in having idols in the church or homes. As such, it is forbidden to have any idols of the Virgin Mary or Jesus Christ. This, they say, is drawn from the 10 commandments which states ‚ÄúYou shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.‚Äù * Akurinu baptism is not necessarily by water. It can also be done using oil or by the laying of hands. This, they say, is drawn from the Bible in Matthew 3:11 where John the Baptist says, ‚ÄúI baptize you with water but after me comes one who is more powerful than I. . . who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.‚Äù * Dead bodies are not allowed near church premises. Praying for the dead is done at the burial site. The dead are not supposed to be taken to a mortuary. Instead, they are preserved using ice and other traditional methods. * Consumption of pork and pork products is forbidden * The Akurinu prefer traditional medicine to modern/ Western medicine. They believe that the use of modern medicine shows lack of faith in the healing power of God. Today, the church has split into several different sub-sects, each with its own style of dress.

He is known in China for revitalizing the scholarship on Chinese Confucian scholar Liang Shuming. He is also often quoted in popular Chinese media sources. He is best known in America for his scholarship and for his role as translator for the first official Chinese delegations to the United States after Richard Nixon's first visits to China. Career Alitto received his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1975 in Chinese history. His advisors were Benjamin I. Schwartz and John Fairbank. History of History Tree Alitto did not immediately find a faculty position in the United States. Instead, he took a part-time role in Donghai University in Taiwan. His first book, published by University of California Press in 1979, The Last Confucian: Liang Shu-ming and the Chinese Dilemma of Modernity won the John K. Fairbank Prize. In it, Alitto studies Liang as a forward looking Confucian who put his thought into action. Liang, along with James Yen and Tao Xingzhi, was a leader in the Rural Reconstruction Movement of the 1920s and 1930s. His Rural Reconstruction project in Zouping County, Shandong, drew national attention but was destroyed in the Japanese Invasion of 1937. Alitto was one of the first foreign academicians allowed into rural China and observed Zouping between 1987 and 1991. He continued visiting the area throughout the 80s and 90s, and it is reported in China Daily that the academic became a regular figure in the area. Influence Alitto is best known in China, where he was instrumental in revitalizing scholarship into Liang Shuming, one of the last major Confucian scholars. Alitto wrote his book The Last Confucian: Liang Shu-ming and the Chinese Dilemma of Modernity in 1979. Before this book, Shuming had been \\"consigned to the dustbin of history.\\" Alitto was widely popularized in the China Central TV episode The Last Confucian and Me. Alitto is often cited in Chinese national media sources. Examples include Alitto's support of Chinese jurisdiction in the Senkaku Islands dispute, his statement that the Falungong \\"represents more of a rupture than a continuity with Chinese religious traditions,\\" or his interest in rural areas of China.

Life and work The son of a shipwright, he was born at Stoke Damerel. In 1845 he was appointed secretary of The Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. He resigned in 1855 to take the position of secretary at the Liverpool Compass Committee. Concurrently he was the Secretary of underwriters Registry for Iron vessels, Liverpool. In 1855 and 1886, Rundell presented two reports to the Board of Trade and the Houses of Parliament giving his observations on the deviation of the compass in vessels having the compasses corrected by magnets. At the 1851 Great Exhibition, Rundell exhibitied a carbonized cast-iron magnet He proposed a way of marking ships to mark percentages of every ships volume as a guide to determine her freeboard He conducted experiments on the with Frederick J Evans RN. The work with Evans related to dealing with the disturbing elements arising from the iron and the magnetisation of the ships. Evans published his work in conjunction with Archibald Smith In 1889, Rundell created charts showing the horizontal variation in the magnetic force acting on a ship's compass needle by the iron within the ship (Dygograms) for HMS Polyphemus, HMS Curlew and HMS Dreadnought are held at National Maritime Museum, Greenwich He published many articles in The Engineer between 1857 and 1883.

Smith later confessed to killing eight women while stationed as a marine in West Germany, for which he was never prosecuted, and authorities believe he could be involved in other murders, both in the USA and overseas. Early life Smith was born at the Illinois Masonic Hospital, to marine Charles Gilbert Smith and Delores Rechlin, who had another four children. The couple separated when Mark was 2 to 3 years old, with his mother receiving primary custody. At the age of 7, his mother remarried, and the family moved out to McHenry County, Illinois, where Smith grew up. He attended the local grade school, but anger issues and the difficulty of adjusting to a new locale resulted in his return to Chicago. A year later, while a student at Edgebrook Public School, Smith attempted to strangle a female classmate behind the school building. One year after that, he stabbed a 6-year-old playmate with a pen knife more than 20 times. The boy managed to survive, and Mark was sent off to a psychiatrist. In 1966, he was enlisted in the army during the Vietnam War and stationed in West Germany, where, in 1967, he was court-martialed for assaulting four African-American colleagues. After three years in the army, he returned to the USA, settling in McHenry County. Murders =Obie Faye Ash= On December 3, 1969, Smith abducted 20-year-old Cotter woman Obie Faye Ash, before proceeding to rape, strangle and repeatedly stab her in the nearby city of Mountain Home. There is no other public information on the case. Smith later admitted Ash's murder in a bench trial. =Jean Bianchi= On January 27, 1970, the 27-year-old housewife and mother of two Jean Bianchi, from McHenry, was last seen at a local laundromat on Elm Street. In the evening, she had phoned her husband to inform him that she would come home shortly, but she didn't return. Bianchi's laundry and an unfinished letter were all located at the laundromat, with no sign of her. Three days later, her body was found in a partially frozen creek near one of the town's bridges, having been sexually assaulted and stabbed multiple times. After chancing upon her, Smith forced Bianchi into his car at knifepoint, whereupon he repeatedly stabbed and raped her. He then drove outside of town and dumped the body in a local stream, but as he was leaving, he saw that she was trying to climb up an embankment and escape. He quickly caught up with her, and inserted his fist up her vagina. Then, he pulled her shirt over her head and continued stabbing Bianchi, to the point where he could clearly hear that her lungs had collapsed. After assuring himself she had died, Smith dumped the body into the stream again, where it was later found at the creek. =Janice Bolyard= On February 27, 1970, Smith was working at the Resin Research Laboratory, part of the Desoto Chemical Company, situated in Mount Prospect. He was left to work in the late evening hours, along with 22-year-old Janice Bolyard, from Evanston. Taking the opportunity to follow her into the basement, Smith began making sexual advances on her, which Bolyard resisted. Infuriated, he began beating her, before choking her into unconsciousness. Smith then moved her to another room, where he took off her undergarments and tampon, before proceeding to rape her. After he had finished, he took her pantyhose and wrapped it around her neck, strangling her to death. She was discovered on the next day, after she'd been reported missing by her fianc√©. =Jean Lingenfelter= On May 27, 1970, exactly three months after the Bianchi murder, 17-year-old Jean Ann Lingenfelter, an honors student at McHenry's local high school who had triple-dated Mark Smith at the school prom, left her home so she could study at a friend's house, as she was only a week away from graduation. After two hours, she left the house so she could meet Smith, and was last seen entering his vehicle. After she did not return home, he parents reported her missing. On the next day, her naked body was found by a young couple on a beach, lying motionless at the Lakeland Park subdivision. Her body showed signs of rape, severe beating and strangulation, as well as sexualt assault on her vagina and rectum. Smith admitted that he raped and strangled Lingenfelter, later inserting a beer bottle in both her vagina and rectum after she had died. He then put the lifeless body in the trunk of his car, and then dumping the body at McCollum Lake. =Suspected= Aside from these murders, Smith himself confessed to killing between three and eight women in West Germany during his enlistment, which he later recanted to just two. German authorities never prosecuted him for these alleged killings, despite his confessions being credible. The prosecutors at his trial alleged that his victim count likely exceeds 20 in number, but because his crimes covered a two-year period over a large geographic area, they were largely ignored. Authorities have questioned him regarding murders in South Vietnam, South Korea, five other states and in Washington, D.C., as well as the still- unsolved Kenilworth 1966 murder of 21-year-old Valerie Percy, daughter of businessman and Republican politician Charles H. Percy. Capture, trial and imprisonment The murders of Bianchi and Lingenfelter had shocked the population of McHenry, and large amounts of people aided in the search for the killer‚Äîone of them being Mark Alan Smith himself. He was arrested and charged with murder, after he discovered Lingenfelter's body \\"by accident\\", with surprising accuracy. He was interviewed shortly after his arrest, where he displayed cold-blooded indifference towards the victim. Additionally, prosecutors recalled a quote from an earlier parole hearing, where he claimed that \\"everybody has got to die sometime\\". He later confessed to the two killings, as well as those of Ash and Bolyard. He was sentenced to 500 years' imprisonment for the Illinois murders in 1971. He dodged the death penalty, as there was a moratorium for it at the time. On April 27, 1977, Smith was caught trying to escape from the Pontiac Correctional Center through the boiler room, to which he later plead guilty and was given another 18 years. While serving his time, Smith's defense attorney, Harold C. McKenney, aided by Jon K. Hahn, helped Smith co-author a book, titled \\"Legally Sane\\", in which Mark described his life and crime spree in vivid detail, where he also admits the killings in Germany. He now claims to be a changed man who can reintegrate into society, having chosen a new identity for himself‚ÄîRemingston Steele. Every 3 years, he has a mandatory hearing for parole, but he claims to know that being released in unlikely. Even if he was to be released, he would have to be transferred to Arkansas, where he will serve a life sentence for the killing of Obie Faye Ash. Smith currently remains incarcerated at Pontiac, where he earns an income through selling oil paintings to guards, and is currently studying for his third college degree.

He had previously suggested parties be held the night before a performance, which suggestions went unheeded. The second reason he gave was his rejection of broadcasting symphony concerts for which the Symphony Association would not be paid. The third reason he gave for his ouster was that he had complained about lack of dressing facilities for concerts at Arizona State College and the fact that no hotel arrangements had been made for musicians imported from out of the Tempe area, and finally, claimed that the Phoenix Symphony Association‚Äôs Board of Directors was ‚Äúantagonistic toward the musicians union.‚ÄùIbid.

One of the purposes of touring Japan was to foster good relations with the country, which was also being courted by the Soviets during the height of the Cold War. Barnett said in a Los Angeles Times article dated September 22, 1957 that the goal of the Orchestra (and the American Embassy) was to put on higher-quality concerts for the average Japanese for the same low price the ‚Äúleftists‚Äù were providing, and also to show camaraderie between Japanese and American musicians working together to overcome any lingering resentment still existing after the war.Ibid.

Acting as Musical Director of the National Orchestral Association from 1930 to 1958, Barzin was looking to retire. National Orchestral Association alumnus John Barnett was an obvious choice as his replacement.‚ÄúBiography of Maestro John Barnett‚Äù, supra. Barnett was intimately familiar with the workings of the National Orchestral Association. He had played as a youth in the Association‚Äôs trumpet section and had benefited from its conductor-training program when he went abroad in 1936 to study conducting with some of the world's most famous conductors. Paul Affelder described the National Orchestral Association in his original liner notes circa 1968 from the Composers Recordings Inc. (CRI) LP of ‚ÄúMusic of Wallingford Riegger‚Äù (conducted by John Barnett in 1967). Affelder stressed that the National Orchestral Association, in addition to being ‚Äúa training school for young musicians,‚Äù provided a bridge between music students graduating from conservatories and music schools and preparing to enter the real world of professional orchestral performance. Members went through grueling rehearsals with a professional conductor, were coached by distinguished professional symphonic players, and gave regular concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Their repertoire was vast as well, requiring the students to learn about 100 standard pieces of the symphonic repertoire each season, in addition to unknown and newly-composed works. This enhanced the ability of the student musicians to quickly read, learn and perform complex works on sight. They were also given the opportunity to accompany great guest soloists from time to time. In a way, it was a ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù orchestra for the major symphony orchestras of the time, similar to minor league baseball teams serving as ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù teams for the major league teams. It was from this ‚Äútraining orchestra‚Äù that many professional conductors chose musicians for their orchestras, many of them going on to hold principal positions in major orchestras around the world.Affelder, Paul. ‚ÄúAlumni of the National Orchestral Association‚Äù (Original liner notes circa 1968 from Composers Recordings Inc.
