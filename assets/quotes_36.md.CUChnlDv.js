Gaye's personal life, mainly documented in the biography, Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye, included religious faith, child abuse by his father, personal relationships with his two wives, friends and girlfriends, and bouts with depression and drug abuse. Childhood religion and abuse Marvin Gaye and his five siblings were brought up in a strict religious Pentecostal sect known as the House of God by their minister father Marvin Gay, Sr. Marvin began singing church solos at the age of four. The House of God took its teachings from Hebrew Pentecostalism, advocated strict conduct, and adhered to both the Old and New Testaments. Gaye remembered the family having to observe an extended Sabbath starting from \\"Friday night at sundown\\" into Saturday. He later explained, \\"We kept the Sabbath in the purest sense. Father anointed converts with olive oil and baptized them in the river. The Sabbath was his day, it was God's day, and it was also a day for singing. Every member was blessed with a good voice. The joy of music was the joy of God.\\" At times, Gaye's father would force his children to answer Biblical questions, disciplining them if they answered wrong. Gaye's relationship with his father was troubled from childhood. According to his sister, Jeanne, Gaye suffered at the hands of his father, who would strike him for any shortcoming, including putting his hair brush in the wrong place or coming home from school a minute late. Gaye's sister recalled that Marvin would \\"constantly provoke Father. He disappeared on Saturday mornings when it was time to go to church.\\" Jeanne Gaye explained that between the ages of 7 well into his teenage years, young Marvin's home life \\"consisted of a series of brutal whippings.\\" Gaye explained his father's abuse to author David Ritz years later, stating \\"It wasn't simply that my father beat me, though that was bad enough. By the time I was twelve, there wasn't an inch on my body that hadn't been bruised and beaten by him.\\" He stated what made the beatings worse was his father prolonging the time before punishing Marvin, making him remove his clothes, and having him hear his father's belt buckle loud enough before he received the punishment. Gaye felt a part of his father was \\"enjoying the whole thing\\". Marvin and his siblings were also bed wetters, which was the result of more whippings. The beatings deeply affected Marvin to the point that whenever he needed to express his need for attention, he would do it through antagonism and projections of violence. While Gaye would later describe living with his father was \\"like living with a king, a very peculiar, changeable, cruel and all-powerful king\\", he embraced the love of his mother, explaining, \\"if it wasn't for Mother, who was always there to console me and praise me for my singing, I think I would have been one of those child suicide cases you read about in the papers\\". Air Force tenure In 1956, a 17-year- old Marvin ran away from home to enlist in the United States Air Force. Sent to bases in states such as Kansas, Texas and Wyoming, Marvin quickly grew tired of having to do menial tasks and began rebelling against the sergeant's strict orders. Eventually, Gaye told officers he had a mental illness and was honorably discharged shortly afterwards in early 1957. Before leaving the Air Force, Gaye lost his virginity to a prostitute. Gaye explained the experience as \\"freaky\\" and started an obsession with what he liked to call, \\"love for sale\\". Gaye noted he saw \\"a world of pure sex where people turned off their minds and fed their lusts, no questions asked. The concept sickened me, but I also found it exciting.\\" Upon his exit from the Air Force, his sergeant stated that Marvin refused to follow orders. Marriages Anna Gordy Gaye Marvin first met Anna Gordy (January 28, 1922 ‚Äì January 31, 2014), 17 years his senior, while Marvin was a staff drummer for the label, Anna Records, in 1960. They began dating shortly afterwards. Anna recalled in an interview in 1987 how Marvin had begun flirting with Anna to get her attention.Marvin Gaye: Motown on Showtime, 1987 After a three-year courtship, the couple married on June 8, 1963 in Chicago. During Gaye's early years in Motown, he was inspired by his relationship with his wife, often writing songs dedicated to her, including his 1963 top ten hit, \\"Pride and Joy\\". Of that song, Gaye later told David Ritz, \\"When I composed 'Pride and Joy', I was head over heels in love with Anna. I just wrote what I felt about her, and what she did for me. She was my pride and joy.\\" The marriage was reportedly volatile with accusations of infidelity and accounts of physical violence committed by the both of them. Anna occasionally helped out in Marvin's compositions, including two hits for Motown group The Originals and several tracks from What's Going On. By the time the couple relocated to Los Angeles in early 1973, their marriage was in turmoil and that spring, they filed for legal separation. Devastated by his marriage's decline, Gaye re-wrote the ballad \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\", as a solemn love song describing the demise of a marriage. In November 1975, after two years of legal separation, Anna Gordy Gaye filed for divorce. The contentious divorce that followed would last more than a year and a half before it was finalized on March 17, 1977. In the divorce decree, Gaye agreed to remit a portion of his royalties to go to Anna for his next album, Here, My Dear, which was released to dismal sales in December 1978. Marvin and Anna maintained a friendship in Marvin's final years. =Birth and adoption of Marvin Gaye III= On November 17, 1966, a baby boy was born to Denise Gordy, just days after her seventeenth birthday. The boy was subsequently adopted by Marvin and Anna. The boy was christened at Detroit's Bethel AME Church and was named after his adopted father. Prior to Marvin III's birth, 44-year-old Anna had faked a pregnancy in public. It was later reported that Gordy was told that she could not naturally conceive a child. Despite his acrimonious relationship with his father, he named him Marvin III \\"to keep up with tradition\\". Denise Gordy admitted in 1998 that she had mothered Marvin III. Gaye's son found the truth after his father's death. Later named as a co- executor of his father's estate after Gaye's death in 1984, Marvin III later had two sons, Marvin IV (b. 1995) and Dylan (b. 2000). Janis Gaye Gaye met 17-year-old Janis Hunter (born January 5, 1956) in March 1973 while working on his Let's Get It On album with producer Ed Townsend. Hunter was the child of jazz musician Slim Gaillard. Townsend's former girlfriend Barbara Hunter arrived in the studio with Janis that month. Janis's presence served as inspiration for Gaye during the making of the album. After their first date, Gaye was inspired to record the composition, \\"If I Should Die Tonight\\". The couple later moved in together, first to Gaye's one-room apartment outside Hollywood and then at Topanga Canyon. During Gaye's 1974 concert tour, he performed the ballad, \\"Jan\\", to his new love. Janis first received public notice when she was featured with Marvin on a November 1974 issue of Ebony. On September 4, 1974, the couple welcomed their first-born, daughter Nona, in Los Angeles. Son Frankie Christian followed a year later on November 16, 1975, a day before Marvin III's and his namesake uncle's birthday. After Gaye's divorce to Gordy was finalized, Gaye married Janis in October 1977 in New Orleans. It was alleged Gaye married her due to concurrent tax issues,Marvin Gaye: Behind the Legend, 2000 but Janis would contend they married after surviving a car accident. Janis later stated Gaye sometimes coerced her into having relationships with other men. The contents of Gaye's 1976 album, I Want You, was heavily inspired by Gaye and Hunter's torrid affair. Author Michael Eric Dyson stated that their relationship in inspiration to the creation of I Want You was \\"nearly palpable in the sensual textures that are the album's aural and lyrical signature\\". Their \\"open\\" marriage, domestic abuse and the couple's drug dependence became too disastrous and Janis filed for legal separation in 1979. Janis later admitted she went \\"back and forth across the ocean, around and around, just chasing this relationship that never worked, but I wasn't willing to give up and neither was he.\\" Despite divorcing in February 1981, the former couple kept in touch and tried to renew a relationship during Gaye's final tour only to separate after another argument, having their final conversations by phone prior to Gaye's death. In 1997, Nona Gaye had a son, Nolan Pentz. Other relationships During the 1960s, it was often debated that Gaye dated his female singing companions such as Mary Wells and Kim Weston; Wells denied any romantic ties to Gaye and Weston later stated their relationship was strictly platonic. The same was said of Gaye's relationship with his most successful duet partner Tammi Terrell. Gaye was deeply devastated following Terrell's collapse at a concert in Virginia where they were performing in 1967. Terrell's later diagnosis and death from a brain tumor would help to send Gaye to a depression. Gaye often blamed himself for Terrell's illness and death despite the fact that Terrell may have developed her tumor since her early childhood.Unsung: Tammi Terrell, 2011 Gaye's devastation over Terrell's death fueled his cocaine addiction.\\"Autopsy: The Last Hours of Marvin Gaye.\\" Autopsy. Nar. Eric Meyers. Exec. Prod. Ed Taylor, Clare Hollywood, and Michael Kelpie. Reelz, February 25, 2018. Television. Following Gaye's separation from Janis, Gaye began dating Dutch-based model Eugenie Vis for two years. Gaye was also involved with British socialite Lady Edith Foxwell during the early 1980s. At one point, according to author Bernard J. Taylor, Foxwell explained that her and Gaye's relationship became serious enough to consider marriage by 1982. Gaye's final girlfriend was an Englishwoman named Deborah Decker. In 1984 Decker later told Parade magazine that she carried Gaye's unborn child during Gaye's final year alive. When family tension became too much, Gaye moved her to an apartment in West Hollywood. Decker later miscarried Gaye's child. Drug abuse Marvin was a heavy marijuana user, during the beginning of his tenure as a member of Harvey and the Moonglows, and he would remain a heavy user throughout his life. Marvin was first introduced to cocaine in the early 1960s. At first, Marvin had issues snorting, so he would use it by either rubbing it on his gums or eating it, but by the late 1970s, he had developed a serious dependence and addiction to the drug and would later begin freebasing while in London. The singer was also a user of PCP. Gaye was briefly sober after having moved to Belgium under the watchful eye of Freddy Cousaert, only to relapse when he returned to the United States from Belgium in October 1982. His addiction led to increasing paranoia and depression. During the promotion of his Sexual Healing Tour, he wore a bullet-proof vest and brought along bodyguards with loaded pistols because he feared for his life as he was convinced that someone was plotting to kill him. When an autopsy was produced on Marvin, they found minor traces of cocaine in his system. Judge Ronald George believed that PCP (or angel dust) was present in Marvin's system, but this was due to a misreading of the coroner's report. Suicide attempts Gaye attempted suicide at least three times. The first occurred in 1969 when he was holed up at a Detroit apartment. Gaye, despondent from his failing marriage at the time, sought to shoot himself with a handgun. Berry Gordy's father, \\"Pops\\", eventually stopped this attempt. In 1979, while in Maui, Gaye ingested a full ounce of cocaine in a second suicide attempt. Gaye explained later, \\"I'd given up. The problems were too big for me. I just wanted to be left alone and blow my brains on high-octane toot. It would be a slow but relatively pleasant death, certainly less messy than a gun.\\" Four days before his death, according to his sister Jeanne, Marvin again attempted suicide by jumping out of a speeding sports car only to suffer minor bruises. According to Frankie Gaye, after he found him dying from his gunshot wounds, Gaye explained that he had his father shoot him because he \\"couldn't do it himself\\". In an interview a year before his death in 1984, he explained his bouts with depression, stating that during his exile, he was \\"a manic-depressive. I was at my lowest ebb. I really didn't feel like I was loved. Because I didn't feel love, I felt useless.\\" References Sources  * * * Gaye, Marvin Category:Marvin Gaye ","title":"Personal life of Marvin Gaye"},{"id":"39425145","text":"Treasury Holdings was an Irish property development company headed by Johnny Ronan and Richard Barrett.

The church then studied expanding the school into a full university with an exploratory committee formed in 1986. The church planned to move forward in 1990, but the First Liberian Civil War delayed the creation of the school, which the goal was re-affirmed in 1997. On 9 October 1998, the Liberian Legislature chartered United Methodist University, with the school, then opening in January 2000 under the leadership of Rev. Dr. Emmanuel F. Bailey. In April 2011, the school and Starz Institute of Technology began a partnership in which Starz would operate the university's information technology program. The next March, UMU discontinued the program after the country's National Commission on Higher Education informed UMU it would have to end the partnership due to Starz not being an authorized degree granting school.

The first journey departed on 11 June 1857 from Gravesend and arrived in Lyttelton on 3 October 1857 with about 194 passengers on board. Joseph Colborne-Veel and his wife were among the passengers. The ship was nearly lost when she was thrown on her beam ends during a squall.

It depicts Dorothea Berck at age 51, the wife of the prosperous Haarlem merchant Joseph Coymans, whose portrait Hals also painted. Both paintings were executed on the occasion of their daughter Isabella's wedding, whose marriage pendants Hals also painted. Detail of her hands The painting, like many of Hals's portraits, is inscribed and signed, but there is no mention of the identity of the sitter, and it was only identified as Berck in 1908.Frans Hals: Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862‚Äì1962., pp 63‚Äì64, publication Frans Hals Museum, 1962 The portrait is noted for its classical similarity to the Mona Lisa. Like the Mona Lisa, she sits upright in a dark chair and rests her hands on either a dark desk or perhaps a large dress that surrounds her. Her ungloved hand may be clasping a book or part of her sleeve. The loose brushwork is typical of Hals and shows a fleeting gesture with the casual way her finger is hooked over her wrist. Portraits of subjects with one glove on and one glove off are common in Dutch 17th-century marriage pendant portraits. Gloves symbolize the wedding vows where the husband and wife each hold one of a pair of gloves. In this case, her husband Joseph Coymans is wearing the \\"other glove\\" in his pendant portrait. In Hals' marriage pendant portraits, the husband is always situated on the left and the woman on the right, and the light always comes from the left, shining fully on the woman. In 1639 the portrait of Baldassare Castiglione by Raphael was auctioned in Amsterdam and caused a sensation, making this posture popular at that time among the sitters for portraits in the Netherlands. Hals is sure to have seen the Castiglione portrait, but it is not certain he was familiar with the Mona Lisa, though works by renaissance masters such as Titian were actively collected and studied throughout the Netherlands and neo-classicism was on the rise at that time.

Starring Fifi Young, Rd Ismail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego, it followed a mother who raises her children lovingly but is ultimately betrayed by her eldest sons when she falls upon hard times. The film, billed as a \\"musical extravaganza,\\" featured a soundtrack by R. Koesbini, and an eponymous title song written by Njoo. The last production completed by Fred Young's Majestic Film Company, Air Mata Iboe was released in December 1941, shortly before the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. This film, now possibly lost, received positive reviews. A remake was produced under the same title in 1957; Young retook her role.  Plot  Soegiati (Fifi Young) is the mother of four children: sons Achmad (Rd Ismail), Idris (S Poniman) and Soemadi (Ali Sarosa), and a daughter named Soepinah (Soelami). She loves them all, but Soemadi receives the most of her attention because he receives little from his father, the merchant Soebagio (Ali Joego). As the children grow, they marry and move away, and eventually only Soemadi is left. Although he begins a relationship with a young woman named Noormala (Soerip), he does not marry her as his income is not enough to support them. On the night of Eid al-Fitr, the family gathers for the holiday. Unknown to the family, Soebagio is leading a double life as a robber, and that evening the police come to arrest him. To protect his father, Soemadi declares himself the culprit, and he is exiled. Feeling guilty for his sins, Soebagio falls ill and dies soon afterwards. Because of their debts, their home and belongings are repossessed, leaving Soegiati to fend for herself. Though wealthy, Achmad and Idris refuse to take Soegiati in, fearing their respective wives Moedjenah (Titing) and Mariam (Ning-Nong). Soepinah and her husband Bakar (Koesbini) are willing to take her in, but they live in poverty. Unwilling to burden them, ultimately Soegiati decides to leave and find her own way, depending on the kindness of strangers. Years pass, and Soemadi returns from exile. Encountering his mother, who now lives in poverty, he decides to take revenge on his brothers.  Production  The cast of Air Mata Iboe The Malang-based Majestic Film Company announced Air Mata Iboe in June 1941 together with two other films, Boedi Terbenam (Hidden Wisdom) and Bachtera Karam (Wrecked Ark). Production began soon afterwards and, by early December 1941, over 55 reels had been shot, as well as 60 sound reels. Air Mata Iboe was written and directed by Njoo Cheong Seng under his penname M. d'Amour; he had previously directed Djantoeng Hati (Heart and Soul; 1941), which also had a tragic ending, for the company. The film was produced by the company's owner, Fred Young. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young (no relation to Fred), Rd Ismail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego. Other roles were held by established singers of keroncong (traditional music with Portuguese influences), including Soerip, Titing, Soelami, Ning Nong, and Poniman. The film, which used make-up to make Fifi Young age into an old woman over the course of its plot, was the actress' first for Majestic; she had been ill during the production of her husband's debut for the company. The black-and- white film featured eleven keroncong songs written by music director R. Koesbini, who also had a role in the film. Backing music was provided by Koesbini's troupe, the Krontjong Syncopaters, while songs were performed by the cast.; ; Notes and lyrics for the film's title song, \\"Air Mata Iboe\\", were published in the December 1941 edition of Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film.  Release and legacy  Fifi Young, made up as an old woman for the film; she retook the role of Soegiati in the 1957 remake. Air Mata Iboe, which was rated for all ages, was distributed by Columbia Pictures and premiered at Sampoerna Theatre in Surabaya on 24 December 1941. Also advertised under the Dutch title Tranen Eener Moeder (a literal translation from Malay), the film was promoted as a \\"musical extravaganza\\"; other advertisements emphasised the size of the cast. An anonymous review in the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad noted the extensive use of keroncong and praised the acting and singing, suggesting that native audiences would flock to see the film. Air Mata Iboe was the last film produced by Majestic Film Company, which closed following the Japanese occupation. During the occupation Njoo, Fifi Young, and Fred Young established their own travelling theatrical troupe, Pantjawarna, though all returned to cinema in the 1950s.; ; Joego likewise returned to film after spending the occupation in theater. Poniman, Sarosa, Ismail, and Soerip all returned to cinema,; ; the men in the 1950s and Soerip in 1973. Soelami is not recorded as acting in any further productions. A remake of Air Mata Iboe was produced in 1957, after Indonesia had obtained its independence. Directed by Fred Young, the film had Fifi Young retake her role as Sugiati, while Rd Ismail took the role of Subagio. The remake's other cast members had not appeared in the original film. The sons Achmad, Idris, and Soemadi were portrayed by Sukarno M. Noor, Boes Boestami, and Kamsul, respectively. The couple's daughter, renamed Atikah, was played by Farida Arriany. Air Mata Iboe may be lost. As elsewhere at the time, films in the Dutch East Indies were shot on highly unstable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, earlier films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that all Indonesian films made before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

He made his debut in 1915. He won two top division tournament championships. His highest rank was ≈çzeki. He retired in 1930 and became a sumo coach. Early life Takahashi had a very large build from a young age. When he was registered for military service at age twenty he measured in at 181 centimeters tall and weighed 80 kilograms. When he joined the Kokura artillery battery, his size was noticed by his commanding officer and he was released from service to enter professional sumo. Career The expectations placed on Takahashi when he debuted in sumo are clear from the ring name of that he was given. It combined one the characters of the recently retired with one of the characters of the former ring name of the then current yokozuna Nishinoumi Kajir≈ç II, which had been . From his entry into sumo in January 1915, he lived up to these expectations and rose steadily through the ranks. In his fourth tournament in January 1917, at jonidan 12 he earned his first championship with a 5‚Äì0 record. After four more years of tournaments with straight winning records he reached the top-tier makuuchi division in the May 1921 tournament. On this occasion he would take the new ring name of Onogawa. In this tournament his record was 4‚Äì5 with one draw. This was his first losing tournament in over six years of sumo. He was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç 1 for the following January 1922 tournament. A 5‚Äì3 record was enough to put him back into makuuchi for the next tournament, where he would remain for the rest of his career. His success continued and he rose steadily through the ranks of maegashira and a very strong showing of 9‚Äì2 at the rank of komusubi in May 1926 would see him promoted to sekiwake. All three of his sekiwake appearances were winning records and in his second and third tournaments at sekiwake he came in second to yokozuna Tsunenohana for the championship. He was promoted to ≈çzeki for the following October 1927 tournament. In his rise to ≈çzeki after his initial losing tournament in his makuuchi debut in May 1921, he had only recorded one more losing record in a span of over six years. Ironically, he would miss his entire first tournament at ≈çzeki due to a bout of influenza. Two tournaments after becoming an ≈çzeki he changed his name to Toyokuni because a sumo elder in ≈åsaka sumo had the name Onogawa. As an ≈çzeki, Toyokuni's winning streak continued, and in the January 1929 tournament he would come one win short of the championship, losing it to then sekiwake Tamanishiki. The following March tournament, Toyokuni attained his first makuuchi championship. Two tournaments later, in September of the same year he was again the runner up for the championship. The following tournament in January 1930 he attained his second and final makuuchi championship. The following tournament in March of that year, he would finally record his first losing tournament in the san'yaku ranks. He bounced back in the following May tournament with an 8‚Äì3 record, but in the subsequent October tournament he withdrew due to a back injury after achieving only a 1‚Äì3 record. Afterwards, he soon announced his retirement. Post wrestler life Upon retiring, Toyokuni would take the elder name Kokonoe and soon after became the head of Kokonoe stable, a previous incarnation of the current Kokonoe stable. Later on his health began to suffer and in May 1937 he was obliged to disband the stable and his wrestlers moved to Asahiyama stable. He died in May 1942 at the age of 48.

Just as all engineering fields incorporate safety considerations into design parameters, sustainability thinking is built into transition engineering. Transition engineering is emerging as a field to give engineers the tools necessary to address sustainability in design and management of engineered systems. Transition engineering is a cross-disciplinary field that addresses the issues of future resource-availability and identifies, then realizes opportunities to increase resilience and adaptation.  Overview  Engineering professions emerge when new technologies, new problems or new opportunities arise. This was the case when safety engineering grew in the early 1900s to combat the high workplace injury and fatality rates. In the 1960s, Environmental engineering emerged as a discipline to reduce industrial pollution and mitigate impacts on environmental health and water quality. Quality engineering came about with the increase in mass production techniques during WWII and the need to confirm the quality of the products. There are two serious problems driving the emergence of Transition Engineering; the exponential growth in the concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and the lack of growth and imminent decline of conventional oil production known as peak oil. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere recently exceeded 400ppm, a level that Earth has not known for 800,000 years. Transition engineering aims to take advantage of the current access to the remaining lower cost and higher EROI energy resources to re- develop all aspects of urban and industrial engineered systems to adapt as fossil fuel use is dramatically reduced.  Origins  The idea behind transition engineering has sprouted from many different roots, both technical and non-technical. The concept of sustainable development has been around since 1987 and the problem of sustainability was a driving force in the development of transition engineering. The Transition Town movement provided further inspiration as it showed that there were many groups of people around the world motivated to prepare for peak oil and climate change. Transition towns and ecovillages demonstrate the need for engineers to build systems that manage un-sustainable risks and provide people with sustainable options. Engineers are ethically required to \\"hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public\\" and answer society's need for sustainable development The origins of safety engineering provided much of the inspiration for transition engineering. At the beginning of the 1900s, business owners viewed workplace safety as a wasted investment and politicians were slow to change. After the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire in New York City killed 156 trapped workers, 62 engineers came together to investigate how to make the workplace a safer place to be. This eventually lead to the formation of the American Society of Safety Engineers. As safety engineering manages the risks of unsafe conditions, transition engineering manages the risks of unsustainable conditions. To give engineers a better grasp of sustainability, transition engineering defines the problem as UN-sustainability. This is similar to the problem of un-safe conditions that is the purpose of safety engineering. We do not necessarily know what a perfectly safe system looks like, but we do know what unsafe systems look like and how to improve them; the same applies to unsustainability of systems. By reducing unsustainability issues we take steps in the right direction  The Seven Step Method  The Transition Engineering method involves 7 steps to help engineers develop projects to deal with changing unsustainable activities. As a discipline, Transition Engineering recognizes that \\"Business as Usual\\" projections of future scenarios from past trends are not valid because the underlying conditions have changed sufficiently from the conditions of the past. For example, the projection of future oil supply in 2050 from data prior to 2005 would give an expectation of a 50% increase in demand over that time-frame. However, the actual production rate of conventional oil has not increased since 2005 and is projected to decline by more than 50% by 2050. #History: First, historical data are gathered and historical trends understood in cultural and political contexts. All historical aspects of the system are considered. Transition Engineering investigates the effects that technology and social developments have on energy and resource demand. How did we get to where we are now? Why are we here? What factors put us here? #Present: This step assesses the current situation. All current capabilities, investments, assets and condition/age of the assets, and liabilities are considered. Energy use is audited and its end- use behavior is assessed #Future: Scenarios from all areas of study are considered to get a consensus view of both inertial trajectories of current trends, and limitations of carrying capacity and resource scarcity. Transition Engineers apply the science of climate change, petroleum geology, ecology, hydrology etc. to describe the \\"forward operating environment\\". Determining the probability of each future outcome creates a future operating environment envelope. This gives engineers and decision makers constraints with varying levels of risk. #Path Break Concepts: Innovation takes place in this step when current assumptions about behavior and economics are set aside in favor of consideration of the forward operating environment at the end-point of the time-frame of study. The TE innovator places him/herself in the future and uses the future design constraints to come up with realistic and workable concepts. The path-break concept is not futuring. #Backcasting: The path break concepts are analysed to see how they differ from the current situation. In this step, the barriers and strategies to change existing systems are also analysed #Trigger Events: Although existing systems carry a large amount of inertia, if the right trigger is applied at the right time, a great amount of change is possible. Triggers can be either disastrous events such as economic collapse, or external changes such as a corporate merger, new law, or new staff. They can also be engineered change projects. The trigger event for safety engineering was the ‚ÄúTriangle shirtwaist factory fire.‚Äù (reference) The challenge is to communicate the advantages and benefits of adaptive change, and to initiate a disruptive event that enables an organization to get out of the rut. See Change Management #Shift Projects: Finally, by planning for future supply and demand, change projects are realized to make best use of the current available resources. Through these projects, society will be more resilient to peak oil and climate change events.  Global Association for Transition Engineering (GATE)  GATE opened the first group in the UK in Feb 2014. GATE is a Professional Engineering Institution; a membership association and learned society, and comprises an emerging network of engineers and non- engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other unsustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for example manufacturing, sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame are at odds with most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid stranded investment by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed. The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016. It is a \\"Charitable Incorporated Organisation\\" or CIO.

Berg and written by Nicole Holofcener, based on a 2004 novel of the same name written by Laura Lippman. The film stars Diane Lane, Elizabeth Banks, Dakota Fanning, Danielle Macdonald, and Nate Parker, and is notable for being Academy Award- winning actress Frances McDormand's debut as producer. The film was released theatrically on May 15, 2015 and on home video on August 4, 2015. Plot The movie is told in non-chronological order, with present scenes intercut with flashbacks that slowly reveal the details of the past as the movie progresses. 18-year-old Ronnie Fuller and Alice Manning have just been released from Juvenile Hall after serving 7 years for the kidnapping and murder of the bi- racial infant granddaughter of the county's first black judge. When asked about the crime, Alice continually insists that she is innocent, a victim of Ronnie's machinations, including Ronnie planting her jack in the box at the scene of the murder to frame her. In flashback we see the girls walking home from a pool party, when Ronnie sees the baby unattended in a stroller on a porch. Despite Alice's pleas not to, Ronnie takes the baby and runs off with her, insisting to Alice that they can take better care of the baby and that it is theirs now. In the present Ronnie is working at a bagel shop in town, while Alice spends most of her days apparently aimlessly walking around town eating junk food, but lying and telling her mother she is searching for employment as per her request. Alice also secretly dreams of finding validation through reality TV stardom, and is shown several times practicing a speech about being a \\"victim\\" of the justice system. Alice's mother Helen Manning is a teacher at the elementary school, and it is apparent she and her daughter have a contentious relationship. Helen is ashamed of Alice being overweight, her unsophisticated tastes, and her lack of interest in the kind of things Helen likes. It is also shown in flashback that before the kidnapping Alice and Ronnie were forced to hang out and go to the pool party together by Helen, who showed favoritism toward Ronnie in front of Alice, connecting with Ronnie over art and with her more free-spirited attitude. Two weeks after Ronnie and Alice return home a couple are shopping in a furniture store with their young curly- haired bi-racial daughter, Brittany Lyttle. While the couple are arguing about couches their daughter goes missing, prompting panic. The two detectives assigned to the case that come to visit the parents include detective Nancy Porter, who worked on the Fuller/Manning case, which still haunts and traumatizes her. Soon the connection between the current case and the previous kidnapping becomes apparent, including the resemblance between Brittany and the previous kidnap victim. Porter and her partner question both Alice and Ronnie. Ronnie is evasive and withdrawn, while Alice tries to subtly suggest Ronnie is responsible. Helen Manning is hostile when questioned. Porter and her partner then dig into the girls lives during juvenile hall and discover some disturbing truths. Ronnie tried to kill herself several times and frequently got into fights. But more alarmingly, it turns out Alice gave birth to a young bi-racial baby girl in prison. Bringing in both Alice and Helen for questioning, the truth begins to unravel. It turns out at age 15 in Juvenile Hall Alice fell into a sexual relationship with a janitor named Rodrigo who worked there, and who was eventually fired when their affair was uncovered. By the time Alice realized she was pregnant it was too late for her mother to force her to get an abortion, so instead her mother forced her into relinquishing the child for adoption. According to Helen, Alice remained fixated on her child, obsessing over it endlessly. In an attempt to placate Alice, Helen lied to her, saying that she had seen her child living with a family in a nice part of town. She said that the girl had beautiful curly hair, and had a heart shaped birthmark on her back. However, unknown to Helen, upon being released from prison, Alice reconnected with Rodrigo, the janitor who had previously impregnated her. Alice‚Äôs supposedly aimless \\"walking\\" had actually been her combing the town, searching for her child. Upon seeing Brittany in the furniture store Alice took her and found that she had a heart- shaped birthmark on her back. Believing Brittany to be her child, Alice took her with the help of Rodrigo, who then took the child to stay at his mother‚Äôs house. Their plan was to keep Brittany there while Alice framed Ronnie for the crime, after which they would go be with their child. After being shown birth certificates that proved Brittany was not her child, Alice was convinced by Porter to take her to Rodrigo's mother's house, where Porter collects Brittany. This is intercut with Ronnie at home in her bathroom, where still overwhelmed by guilt over the original kidnapping and murder, she commits suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Porter returns Brittany safely to her grateful and tearful parents. It is revealed shortly after that Alice made a deal with the district attorney, and that all charges against her have been dropped while Rodrigo is arrested for the kidnapping and statutory rape. Porter and Jones watch in disgust and Alice revels in the media attention, and gives the speech she practiced about being an innocent victim of the justice system for the news cameras. Finally, the details of the ending of the first kidnapping are revealed. It shows Ronnie worrying about the baby, and begging Alice to let her take the baby back. Alice is then shown manipulating and forcing Ronnie into strangling the baby, running away as Ronnie does it. Horrified, Ronnie goes to Helen and confesses what has happened. Helen says that she can make sure that Alice is punished equally along with Ronnie, and we discover that it was Helen who gave Ronnie Alice's jack in the box, telling her to plant it at the scene of the crime. Finally, in the last scene we are again shown the porch on the day of the original kidnapping, except this time Alice is shown standing over the baby carriage instead of Ronnie. This implies that it was actually Alice who instigated the whole kidnapping to begin with, and that it was Ronnie who was the innocent tag-along, not Alice.

On July 31, 2012, Variety posted the news that Nicole Holofcener had dramatized the script for the film from Lippman's novel and Amy J. Berg was slated to direct the film; it would mark her narrative directorial debut.  Casting  Diane Lane, who was added to the cast by producer McDormand, was signed to the role of Helen Manning, the mother of Alice Manning, an 18-year-old girl who becomes a suspect in the disappearance of a missing child. On September 9, Elizabeth Banks also signed to co-star with Lane. Banks's character, Detective Nancy Porter, finds herself emotionally involved in the case. On February 7, 2013, Dakota Fanning and Danielle Macdonald joined Lane and Banks in the cast of the film. Fanning was signed for the lead, Veronica \\"Ronnie\\" Fuller, 18-year-old, who is suspected in the disappearance of a missing child. Macdonald was signed to the role of 18-year-old Alice Manning, who is also suspected in the missing child's disappearance. Nate Parker also joined the cast in March 2013, in the role of a police officer partnered with Banks.  Filming  Principal photography of the film began in March 2013 in New York City.  Release  Every Secret Thing premiered in the Spotlight section at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2014. The film generated a fair amount of buzz at the festival and sold out all of its three screenings and a fourth screening was added that also sold out. The film got positive reviews. The actors were particularly praised, especially Diane Lane's performance. It was widely reported in October 2014 that Starz and Anchor Bay Entertainment had acquired the rights to distribute Every Secret Thing in the United States. The deal was completed shortly after the Toronto Film Festival at which the film was again widely acclaimed. WME Global negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmakers and it was for theatrical release, home video and pay TV. \\"This is an amazing film,\\" said Kevin Kasha, head of acquisitions for Starz. \\"It's a gripping story with a great cast and we're excited to have it on Starz and to handle distribution via Starz Digital Media and Anchor Bay.\\" \\"Every Secret Thing is a remarkable collaboration of females in film and offers a unique look into the minds of teenagers,\\" commented Amy Berg. \\"I am so pleased it will be in theatres in the spring.\\" On March 12, 2015, the film was screened at a New York Film Critics Series event and a Question and Answer session was conducted afterwards with stars Diane Lane and Dakota Fanning, director Amy Berg, and producer Frances McDormand. This was a pre-release event, with the actual theatrical release date being later in May 2015. The trailer, website and poster became active and available on April 15, 2015, officially announcing the film's theatrical release date for May 15, 2015.  Reception   Box office  Every Secret Thing grossed $103,536 in the United States and Canada. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 32% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.26/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Every Secret Thing has a sterling pedigree both on and off the screen, yet all that talent adds up to little more than a listless, predictable thriller.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100, based on 15 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Plot Alicia (Juno Temple), making her first trip outside the United States, arrives in Chile where her cousin Sara (Emily Browning) is studying, to accompany her on a road trip with Sara's boyfriend Agust√≠n (Agust√≠n Silva), as well as his sister B√°rbara (Catalina Sandino Moreno) and his friend Brink (Michael Cera). However, Sara soon receives a call which reminds her of an important exam that she cannot miss. Alicia is nervous about being left alone with a group of Sara's friends, but is reassured that Sara will be back in only a day. She leaves, while the rest of the group continue on to the island where they are to stay. Several unexpected events along the journey result in Alicia becoming concerned that B√°rbara is irritated with her presence. They all finally reach the island, where Alicia grows increasingly isolated due to both the lack of a phone signal in which to reach Sara, and the behavior of Brink, whom she finds self-centred and antagonizing. Having not had much sleep, Agust√≠n invites her along for a walk the next morning, where she becomes upset after Brink kills a macaw with the air rifle he had brought along. She runs off into the hills and finds a phone signal to call Sara, who says that she'll have to stay in the city for one more day. Alicia becomes exasperated, calling the group \\"sadists\\", but the signal dies before Sara can respond. Alicia returns to Agust√≠n and Brink, and also finds a wandering sheepdog, which she happily pets until she realizes that it is humping her leg. She recoils in disgust and Brink laughs as Agust√≠n chases the dog away. Later that night, Alicia continues to be mocked by Brink about the incident; he begins to play wrestle with her until she becomes frightened and kicks him in the nose. Alicia becomes increasingly uncomfortable feeling unwelcomed and humiliated by the group. She tearfully manages to call Sara again, who arrives on the island the next day and speaks to Alicia in private. Alicia references the call from the previous night, but Sara says she did not get a call from her. In a whispered conversation Sara reveals she did not have to take a test but had an abortion. The group decides to cliff dive into the water later that day. Agust√≠n, Brink and Sara all manage to perform the dive, yet Alicia becomes extremely fearful of the jump. Ultimately, she has an attack of vertigo and is brought back to the cabin. Sara is concerned that Alicia does not seem well due to a lack of sleep, but the group does not pay much attention. That night, Agust√≠n demonstrates hypnosis on Alicia, who they think begins to loosen up when she performs the tasks Brink playfully orders her to do. However, she snaps out of her trance when he tells her to put her hand in the fireplace and she burns herself. Sara puts Alicia to bed after the incident and leaves with Agust√≠n. Alicia, however, begins to suffer hallucinations of Sara and Brink in the room. Later in the night, she wanders around the house and hears voices of the others talking about her disparagingly, but finds only Brink asleep when she investigates. In his room, she finds the air rifle and momentarily aims it at him, before pulling down her pants and waking him up by forcing his face into her crotch and leaving. When Sara returns to the cabin, she notices that Alicia has covered all of the mirrors. The next day, Brink angrily confronts Alicia, but she becomes distraught and denies that it ever happened. As Sara and Agust√≠n attempt to calm the situation, Alicia runs off and breaks down in tears in front of Melda (Roxana Naranjo), another resident of the island. Melda takes her and the group to her home, where she treats Alicia's burn with herbal remedies. They all then return Alicia to the cabin and put her to bed again. Sara suggests to the group that Alicia should be taken to a hospital, but is told that the nearest one is five hours away. They then discover that she has escaped her room under the cover of darkness and has consumed all of B√°rbara's sleeping pills; after intensively searching the island, the group discover Alicia back at the cliff face. They all attempt to talk her down, but she finally jumps in and is recovered. The group desperately bring Alicia back to Melda, where she finally suffers a complete mental breakdown. Melda brings her to the island's only healer, who begins an ancient ritual that involves the body of a lamb and ritualistic music. Sara begins to panic as Alicia becomes calm and is convinced that she has died; the healer insists that Alicia's soul has only left her body temporarily for purification. The film ends as the group brings Alicia to the mainland on a motorboat, as Sara desperately tries to revive her cousin.

Werley became the first nurse researcher at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Army Nurse Corps converted to a baccalaureate- prepared group under her leadership. She was a founding editor of Research in Nursing and Health. She co-created the Nursing Minimum Data Set in 1991. Biography Harriet Werley was born on October 12, 1914 in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Though her father died when she was young and she grew up poor, Werley was able to complete a diploma from the Jefferson Hospital School of Nursing in 1940. She joined the Army Nurse Corps the following year and served in the Mediterranean during World War II. Werley completed an undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley between 1946 and 1948. She returned to an active military duty and completed a graduate degree in nursing administration in 1951. While in leadership roles with the Army Nurse Corps between 1951 and 1955, Werley moved the corps to an entirely baccalaureate- prepared group. She then developed a nursing research department at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Werley retired from the military in 1964 as chief nurse of the US Eighth Army. She completed a doctorate in 1969 from the University of Utah. After leaving the military, Werley was on the nursing faculty at Wayne State University, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Missouri and the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee. During her academic career, Werley became a founding editor of Research in Nursing and Health and she helped to create a data classification system known as the Nursing Minimum Data Set. Werley was named a Charter Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing in 1973; she was designated a Living Legend by the organization in 1994. She became a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics in 1991. Legacy The University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee is home to the Harriet H. Werley Center for Nursing Research and Evaluation.

Reception Low Down was met with mixed reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 47 critics' reviews, 24 positive and 23 negative, bringing the score to 51%, averaging 5.68/10. The film's consensus reads: \\"Rich in mood and on-screen talent but lacking in narrative depth, Low Down tells an oft-told tale with a troubling dearth of imagination.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator, gives the film 58 out of 100 based on reviews from 21 critics (six of them positive, thirteen mixed, and two negative), with its general agreement being \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com, gave the film three- and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \\"a very good jazz movie and a very good heroin movie,\\" while Rex Reed described Elle Fanning's performance as \\"heartbreaking.\\" George Varga of the San Diego Union-Tribune deemed Low Down \\"a grimly gripping movie\\" but was less effusive than Seitz, giving it two-and- a-half stars. David Edelstein, in Vulture, praised the performances by Hawkes, Fanning, and much of the supporting cast, but felt that the film was \\"not as entertaining as\\" the book on which it was based: \\"The weakness of Low Down is that it misses the wry tone and scruffy, eccentrically funny parts of [Amy-Jo] Albany‚Äôs memoir.\\" References External links * * Category:2014 films Category:2010s musical drama films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American independent films Category:American musical drama films Category:American films Category:Biographical films about musicians Category:Jazz films Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about heroin addiction Category:Films about pianos and pianists Category:Films set in the 1960s Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners Category:Cultural depictions of American men Category:Cultural depictions of jazz musicians Category:2014 drama films ","title":"Low Down"},{"id":"39425576","text":"Johnny Ronan is an Irish businessman and property developer known for establishing Treasury Holdings in 1989 along with Richard Barrett. Following the Irish property crash in 2008, the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) took over the loans of Treasury Holdings resulting in its ultimate demise. While the company itself was liquidated in 2012, many of the assets were later rolled into a residual entity named Ronan Group Real Estate (RGRE) owned by Ronan and Colony Capital while Richard Barrett went on to establish Bartra Capital Property. The \\"Pink palace\\", the former home of Ronan at Burlington Road, Dublin 4 Early life Ronan was born into a well-off farming family in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary. He was educated at Castleknock College before going on to train as a Chartered Accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers. He initially became involved in property deals with his property developer father before setting out on his own in the late 1970s. Treasury Holdings Ronan teamed up with his former school friend Richard Barrett from Mayo to form Treasury Holdings in 1989. The company grew to become one of the largest Irish commercial property developers and was known for landmark buildings on Dublin's skyline. Among Treasury Holdings‚Äô high-profile developments were the Montevetro (later to become Google's European Headquarters) and Alto Vetro buildings on the Grand Canal Dock basin, the Convention Centre Dublin, the Ritz Carlton in Powerscourt, the Treasury building which housed the offices of the NTMA and the Irish headquarters of PwC at One Spencer Dock. Real Estate Opportunities (in which Treasury Holdings had a 60% stake), was responsible for building and agreeing with the sale of the Montevetro office building on Barrow Street in Dublin to Google for ‚Ç¨99.9m. It was Dublin's tallest commercial office building at the time of construction and was sold via a receivership process. Battersea Power Station In November 2006, Real Estate Opportunities purchased Battersea Power Station and the surrounding land for ‚Ç¨532 million (¬£400 million). This was Treasury's biggest single scheme and in 2012 it secured the largest planning permission ever granted in central London ‚Äì approximately 8.5 million square feet of residential, office and retail space masterplanned by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi√±oly. The scheme also included an extension of the Northern Line Underground. On 30 November 2011, it was officially announced that the scheme's lenders Lloyds Bank and NAMA would put it into Administration. It was subsequently sold to a Malaysian consortium led by SP Setia, which had been in negotiations with Treasury Holdings prior to the Administration to buy the scheme. Setia later hired the Treasury management team to manage the construction of the scheme. Decline In October 2012, following the effects of both the collapse of the Irish property bubble and the Great Recession, the High Court appointed liquidators to Treasury Holdings and 16 related companies. The move followed a decision by Treasury not to resist a winding-up application by one of its banks, KBC, over a debt of ‚Ç¨55m. Treasury had debts of ‚Ç¨2.7bn, ‚Ç¨1.7bn of which was owed to NAMA.RTE News  Ronan Group Real Estate  Ronan retained substantial assets outside of Treasury Holdings and in April 2015 these were refinanced in a ‚Ç¨300 million deal with backing from Colony Capital, M&G; Investments, and Deutsche Bank. Ronan repaid his debts at par and exited NAMA. The refinancing for the deal was secured on RGRE's portfolio of 24 assets in Dublin - including three Grafton Street retail properties, the Treasury Building, a number of other buildings in Dublin 2, Kilmore House in Spencer Dock, and Connaught House in Burlington Road. RGRE was soon involved in notable ventures with a combined worth of more than ‚Ç¨1bn including restarting the planning phase of the mothballed 23 storey Aqua Vetro skyscraper adjoining Tara Street station in Dublin. Other projects include the ‚Ç¨150m Vertium office building on Dublin's Burlington Road and a ‚Ç¨350m Facebook office campus in Ballsbridge on what was previously the head office of AIB. RGRE also signed off on a ‚Ç¨600m deal to develop Spencer Place, on Dublin's North Docks which will be Dublin's biggest property development since 2008 and will be adjacent to Treasury Holding's earlier Spencer Dock development.

The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915. Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail. Once it no longer served as the county jail, the Gardnerville jail took on another, racially charged purpose. Gardnerville was a sundown town, and it rang a bell every night to order American Indians out of town. In addition, the unemployed were considered vagrants and were not allowed on the town's streets after dark. The jail housed violators of both of these policies until it closed in the 1950s. The jail was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 16, 2003.

It is most often attributed to Joe \\"King\\" Oliver, though some have argued that Louis Armstrong was in fact the composer. This is partly because \\"Dippermouth\\", in the song's title, was a nickname of Armstrong's. Also, the phonograph recordings from 1923 gave credit to Armstrong and Oliver jointly. The song is a strong example of the influence of the blues on early jazz. There is a twelve-bar blues harmonic progression, with frequent bent notes and slides into notes. Armstrong plays second cornet on the April 6, 1923, recording, with Honor√© Dutrey on trombone, Johnny Dodds on clarinet, Lil Hardin on piano, Baby Dodds on drums and Bill Johnson on banjo and vocal. Oliver's plunger mute solo on first cornet became one of the most frequently- imitated solos of his generation. Notably, Oliver pre-composed this solo, playing the same solo on the second recording two weeks later for Okeh. During Armstrong's tenure in the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, the song was recorded on May 29, 1925 in a new arrangement by Don Redman under the title Sugarfoot Stomp.Frank Driggs. A Study In Frustration. Columbia Records C4L 19, 1961, liner notes. Redman selected this tune out of a book of manuscripts shown to Redman by Armstrong; in the arrangement, Armstrong paraphrases Oliver's solo without the plunger effects. After his departure, the Henderson Orchestra recorded the tune again as \\"Sugarfoot Stomp\\" on March 19, 1931; both versions can be found on the compilation A Study In Frustration (1961). Dr. John covered the song on his 2014 album Ske-Dat-De-Dat: The Spirit of Satch.

The competition is principally concerned with the effectiveness of navigation technique used by competitors to swim an underwater course following a route marked on a map prepared by the competition organisers, a compass and a counter meter to measure the distance covered. The sport was developed in the Soviet Union during the late 1950s and is currently played mainly in Europe. It is known as Orientation Sub in French and as La Orientaci√≥n Subacu√°tica in Spanish. Historically, the sport has also been known as Technical Disciplines.  Equipment  Each competitor has the following recreational diving equipment: a diving mask, fins, a diving weighting system, an open circuit scuba set including diving cylinder filled with only breathing air of atmospheric origin and the following instruments: underwater compass and distance counting meter. Each competitor also must tow a buoy to identify his/her position underwater at all times when in the water. Competitors in the Monk Competition (refer below) are permitted to use one buoy between a pair of competitors provided a buddy line is used (i.e. wrist to wrist). An exposure suit (i.e. wetsuit with hood) is required where the water temperature is less than 14 degrees Celsius. Competitors are not permitted to use underwater search techniques and aids (such as rope assisted searches or sonar) or to use underwater communication devices. The equipment used in this sport has evolved since the sport's creation in order to improve competitor performance. Firstly, all of the scuba equipment and instruments are now usually mounted together in a housing to create a streamlined form that can be held in front of the competitor to reduce resistance whilst swimming underwater and with a bracket to locate the instruments in front of the competitor allowing use whilst swimming and navigating the event courses. Secondly, competitors use monofins in order to move faster underwater. Competitors are permitted to use survey equipment such as a theodolite or a total station to check maps issued by the competition organisers with exception to the maps for the Monk Competition (refer below). However, competitors are not permitted to check distances and directions by swimming or operating a boat on the course.  Competition area  The competition is usually held in natural water bodies such as freshwater lakes. Site selection criteria include a maximum current of 4 metres/minute, water depth no less than 3 metres, underwater visibility to be at least 1 metre (measured with a secchi disk) and water quality is to be in accordance with World Health Organization requirements for bathing water. Competition sites are not permitted to be located in shipping lanes and areas intended for boating and swimming activity. The site when in use for competition is marked by buoys anchored 50m from the course.  Events  M-course 5-point course Star course Parallel course Four individual events and three team events are currently described in the International Rules.  Individual events  The M-Course is a ‚ÄòM‚Äô shaped course of a total length of 590 metres consisting of a starting buoy, three rounding buoys and a finish line. Competitors are required to swim underwater around the rounding buoys in sequence and cross the finish line within the time limit of 15 minutes 20 seconds. Competitors are ranked using a point scoring system for correctly rounding the three buoys and for course accuracy at the finish line. The 5-Point Course is a course of a total length of 650 metres consisting of a starting buoy and five orienteering points of which the last is the finish, all laid out in an irregular shape. Competitors are required to swim underwater around the course in sequence and to confirm the discovery of each orienteering point ‚Äòby clearly pulling or spinning it‚Äô. Competitors are ranked using a point scoring system for each orienteering point found and for the speed of the swim around the course. The Star competition is a star-shaped course of a total length of 600 metres consisting of a starting buoy, five rounding buoys and five orienteering buoys of which the last is the finish. Competitors are required to swim underwater around the course in sequence and to confirm the discovery of each orienteering point ‚Äòby clearly pulling or spinning it‚Äô. Competitors are ranked using a point scoring system for correctly rounding the five buoys, for each orienteering point found and for the speed of the swim around the course. The Parallel Race is a single-elimination tournament where pairs of divers from a pool of competitors usually numbered at 32 race against each other over five rounds until one competitor is left un-eliminated and therefore is the winner. The course consists of a pair of two triangular- shaped courses (known as Course A and Course B) of equal overall length and located next to each other. Each course has a total length of 220m and consists of one start buoy, one rounding buoy, one orientation buoy and a finish line of three to four metres width.  Team events  Monk course Team course option A Team course option B The Monk Competition is an event where a team of two competitors is required whilst underwater to plan and then navigate from the start to the finish of the course via a number of orienteering points (also called control points) shown on a waterproof map provided at the start of the event within a maximum time of 18 minutes. The map contains details of the shore lines, boundary of the competition area, and the exact position of start, finish and the control points to be located. The course consists of one starting buoy and at least five control points of which the last to be located is the finish point. All of the control points with exception to the finish point are not visible above the water's surface. The overall length is 650 metres with control points spaced at 100 to 150 metres apart. The teams are ranked using a point scoring system for the number of control points located and for the speed of the swim around the course. 'The Team event is an event where a team of three or four competitors start alone and progressively meet each other during the underwater swim within specified time limits and finish the course as a group within 15 minutes 20 seconds. Two variants of the event can be used subject to the water conditions at the competition site: Version A where the visibility is less than 2 to 3 metres and Version B where the visibility is greater than 2 to 3 metres. Competitors are ranked individually using a point scoring system for the number of orienteering points reached and for the speed and precision of the swim at the finish around the course, multiplied by a factor determined by the number of competitors completing the course. The Relay orienteering event is a relay race offered in the International Rules as an optional event for CMAS and national championships.  Competitor admission requirements  Competitions organised under the auspices of Conf√©d√©ration Mondiale des Activit√©s Subaquatiques (CMAS) are open to both men and women in separate competition categories as well as mixed gender teams. Competitors are also divided by age where adults are older than 21 years and youths are persons between the ages of 15 to 21 years. Each competitor is required to be a member of a national diving federation affiliated to CMAS, have a CMAS Sports license valid for the year of competition, and be able to provide evidence of their nationality, their medical fitness to use scuba and their qualification to scuba dive.  Governing body  The governing body is the Orienteering Commission of the CMAS Sport Committee. As of May 2013, the following countries and territories have affiliated with the Commission - Austria, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain and Ukraine.  Origins and history  The creation of the sport is attributed to underwater divers in the USSR. The first international competition was held in Crimea during 1965 with participants attending from Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy and the USSR. Within Central Europe, the first competitions were held in Angera on Lake Maggiore in Italy during 1961 and at W√∂rthersee in Austria during 1962. The program at the first European Championship in 1967 consisted of two underwater swimming races over distances of 40 and 1000 metres, an M-course and a team competition for three competitors involving two swims of 1,150 metres and the completion of an underwater task at the end of the first swim. The underwater swimming races were retained until 1969. The M Course was substantially revised in the proposed international rules tabled by the USSR at the CMAS General Assembly in 1969 with a change from precision to speed by the introduction of the points system. The 5 point course was introduced as an individual competition in 1968, followed by the Monk Competition during the 1970s and the Star competition in 1987. The Orienteering Commission was established within the CMAS Sports Committee in January 1969 under the name of the Technical Discipline Commission (French: Commission Technique Subaquatique) with Valentin Stachevski of the USSR as its first president.  Championships  Prior to 1967, all competition was held in Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Major championships have been conducted at continental level within Europe since 1967 and at world level since 1973. A regional event called the European Cup which was awarded for the best result in five regional competitions within Europe was introduced in the early 1970s. Regular attendance at the European Cup by competitors from South Africa resulted in its renaming as the World Cup in 1989.

It is classified as a part of the Corso Italia-Davenport neighbourhood by the City of Toronto. and is situated on the western crest of the Davenport escarpment. This neighbourhood has many distinguishing characteristics including very large turn of the century houses, winding tree- lined streets, and an elevation atop the Davenport escarpment that offers many home owners excellent views of the Toronto skyline. Its main commercial shopping area is along St. Clair Avenue West between Dufferin Street and Oakwood Avenue. History European Settlements In 1830, Bartholomew Bull built the first brick house in York Township, north of Davenport Road. A map of the area from 1852, with Davenport Road highlighted. Previously used as a footpath used by the First Nations, it was widened in the 1850s, and named Davenport Road. In 1824, an Irishman, Bartholomew Bull, bought land east of Dufferin Street and south of St. Clair Avenue West. He first built a log cabin and cleared land for a farm. In 1830, he constructed the first brick house in York Township, and called it Springmount. The house was located north of Davenport and west of Springmount Avenue, with a view of the lake. During the winter, the Bull children would dam a nearby tributary of Garrison Creek to create a skating rink. Prior to the 1860s, the Bull family built a new house near the corner of Dufferin Street and St. Clair Avenue West. When Springmount was demolished in 1883, Bartholomew's oldest son saved a hand-carved bookcase as a family treasure. Once he built his brick home in 1830, Bartholomew Bull volunteered the use of his log cabin not only as the first school in the neighbourhood but also as a site where travelling Methodist clergy could preach. This was the first church in Regal Heights. Life was hard on early Ontario farms. The John Carroll wrote about his youth on his brother's farm in York County in the 1820s recalling \\"frugal fare and work, work, work.\\" (John Carroll, My Boy's Life, Toronto: 1882 quoted in Peter Baskerville, Ontario - Image, Identity and Power, Toronto: 2002.) In the 1850s, the old Indian path at the base of the hill was widened and called Davenport Road, after the village of Davenport, which was established near Davenport Road and Symington Avenue‚Äîwest of today's Regal Heights neighbourhood. Although originally improved by the colonial government, for many years during the 19th century the road was privately owned and people using it had to pay tolls. The 1830s cottage of the toll keeper at Bathurst Street and Davenport Road survives and is located in a park at the northwest corner of the intersection. Travel on Davenport Road was not easy in the 19th century. A grandson of Bull described the road as \\"an epic of mud.\\" Davenport Hill was a challenge as well. Locals used to observe that horses tired from pulling wagons along muddy Davenport Road would drop to the ground at the thought of having to pull a load up the hill. By the 1890s, the Bull family sold off the farm at Dufferin and St. Clair so that the land could be developed as city lots. Roads were surveyed and schools built following 1910, however the widespread construction of homes did not occur until the 1920s. Between 1900 and 1914, the land northwest of Regal Heights was developed by British immigrants who would buy property and build temporary shelters for their families before constructing their homes. This area was known as the shacklands. Judi Coburn has written The Shacklands (Toronto: Sumach Press, 1998), about the life of girl growing up in the neighbourhood. Twentieth century Oakwood Collegiate Institute is a public secondary school located in the northern area of Regal Heights. Opened in 1908, it is operated by the Toronto District School Board. During the First World War (1914-1918), the City of Toronto expanded as new factories were built to meet the needs of Canada's war effort. In 1916, the Ford Motor Company built a factory at the corner of Dupont Street and Christie Street. The following year, Canadian Aeroplanes Ltd., opened the largest aircraft factory in the British Empire at Dupont Street and Dufferin Street. The people working in these factories needed homes to live in. Brick homes - both detached and semi- detached‚Äîwere built in the Regal Heights neighbourhood for both workers and executives. Many homes featured porches, while their interiors were graced with wood paneling, and leaded and stained glass influenced by the arts and crafts movement. Building these homes was relatively easy because during the term of Toronto Mayor George Reginald Geary (1910-1912), streets were laid out and construction started on two schools, Regal Road elementary and Oakwood Collegiate Institute. Davenport Road was paved, making it a safe, swift link between the neighbourhood and downtown Toronto. During this period, Toronto artists were attracted to the scenery and the colour of a growing community. Before he became a leading member of the Group of Seven, Lawren Harris painted pictures of the homes and temporary shacks of residents in the Bathurst Street and St. Clair Avenue West area. In 1926 and 1932, George Agnew Reid and Doris McCarthy painted murals in the Dufferin/St. Clair Branch of the Toronto Public Library. Although these art treasures were painted over in 1964 and considered lost forever; they were restored in 2008 as part of an expansion of the branch by the public library board. The illustration below is \\"The Family\\", one of a series of panels painted by Reid who described his goal to present community life in an idealistic fashion through a series of pastoral landscape. The murals include the names of 12 British authors and eight literary themes throughout the composition. McCarthy's murals were painted in the children's club room in 1932 and feature bright, energetic scenes from familiar British and American fairy tales, such as Jack the Giant Killer, Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella. Prior to the expansion of the branch library, local residents David Self and John McAuley worked with the local librarian and the library board to develop a strategy for restoring the murals and recruited conservationist Laslo Cser to show how this could be done. The Regal Heights Residents Association raised funds to support this work and was recognized for its effort by Heritage Toronto in the 2008 heritage awards. The restoration of the murals is a symbol of the community's active involvement in the creative arts, encouraged by local organizations such as Art Starts. Regal Heights thrived during the 1920s. In the 1940s, the demand for housing grew quickly and some of the larger homes were subdivided to provide privacy for individual members of extended families, or extra income for the owner. The population of Regal Heights has changed over the years. Initially home to many British immigrants, it was also home to a significant Jewish community during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, many of whom were merchants on St. Clair Ave. In the postwar years, the area changed dramatically with an influx of immigrants from Italy. In recent years, the area has become more multicultural, including many Latin Americans. An active neighbourhood in Canada's largest city, Regal Heights provides the kind of environment that encourages people to do their best. Nathan Phillips, a Mayor of Toronto, lived in Regal Heights during the 1940s and '50s. Marilyn Bell, the first swimmer to conquer Lake Ontario, lived in the neighbourhood as a child and swam in a pool now occupied by the parking lot for a local supermarket. Charmaine Crooks, a successful amateur athlete who has represented Canada at the Olympics, the Pan-American Games and the Commonwealth Games, grew up in Regal Heights. Since the 1970s, the Regal Heights Residents' Association has helped neighbours work with neighbours to make our community a good place to live and work. In 2000 and 2001, the Association's garden committee won awards from the City of Toronto's Green Committee. Geography View of Toronto from Regal Heights, 1920.jpg While much of Toronto is flat land, unique geographic features set the Regal Heights neighbourhood apart. The most prominent is the 50 to 75 foot bluff‚Äîcalled Davenport Hill or the Davenport Escarpment‚Äîjust north of Davenport Road which marks the shoreline of a prehistoric lake that was formed at the end of the Ice Age, about 12,000 years ago. Today the bluff is a picturesque feature that gives homes on Regal Road a view of Lake Ontario, the Niagara Peninsula and the city of St. Catherines, and helps capture cooling breezes from the lake on hot summer days. Tributaries of Garrison Creek, which supplied water to Fort York‚Äîthe military camp that helped found Toronto in the 1790s‚Äîalso shaped the local landscape. Springmount, Alberta and Mount Royal Avenues were built on top of or close to the actual creek bed. Garrison Creek was treated as a garbage dump in the 19th century and to protect public health it was put in an underground sewer pipe between 1880 and 1914. Gardeners in the area find the soil in the Regal Heights neighbourhood to be largely heavy clay. Treated well, the land can be productive and during the 19th century small farms and market gardens were established to feed surrounding communities such as the Villages of Carlton, Davenport, Brockton and Yorkville, as well as the City of Toronto. Before farmers tilled the land, stands of white oak and pine covered the landscape. A handful of century old white oak trees can still be found in the neighbourhood. Towering Norway Maple trees, planted by the city in the 1920s, shade the front yards of many homes. In addition to cash crops, settlers planted ornamental gardens around their homes. In 1853, printer, editor, politician and businessman, George Thomson bought a house in the nearby Carleton Village, at St. Clair Avenue West and Old Weston Road. He recalled growing lilac, lobelias, orchids, prairie rose, and cacti, as well as bushes such as spiraea and St. Johns-Wort.

It is a shrub with mostly pinnate leaves, with white to pale pink four-petalled flowers in leaf axils. Description Boronia anemonifolia is an erect shrub that grows to a height of with pimply glands on its branches. The leaves are usually pinnate, sometimes simple or bipinnate, mostly long and wide in outline on a petiole usually long. The leaflets or simple leaves are wedge- shaped to elliptic or egg-shaped, mostly long, wide, the same colour on both sides and often with the tip divided into three lobes. The flowers are white to pale pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to nine in leaf axils, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The four sepals are broadly egg- shaped, long and wide. The four petals are long and with their bases overlapping. There are eight stamens with those near the sepals slightly longer than those nearer to the petals. Flowering occurs from August to April and the fruit is a glabrous capsule, long and about wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia anemonifolia was first formally described in 1825 by Allan Cunningham and the description was published in the book Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales. The specific epithet (anemoniifolia) is a reference to the similarity of the leaves of this species to those in the genus Anemone. In 2000, Peter Neish and Marco Duretto described four subspecies of B. anemonifolia, that have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Boronia anemonifolia A.Cunn. subsp. anemonifolia has leaves that are simple, pinnate or bipinnate, less than wide and with three teeth on the end, the petiole about the same length as the leaflets, the leaflets hairy when young and the petals not remaining on the fruit; * Boronia anemonifolia subsp. aurifodina P.G.Neish has simple leaves , or if trifoliate, the petiole is much longer than the leaflet and has petals that are long; * Boronia anemonifolia subsp. variabilis P.G.Neish has leaves that are simple, pinnate or bipinnate, the petiole about the same length as the leaflets, the leaflets glabrous and the petals not remaining on the fruit; * Boronia anemonifolia subsp. wadbilligensis P.G.Neish has leaves that are simple, pinnate or bipinnate, the leaflets without teeth on the end and wide, the petiole about the same length as the leaflets, the leaflets hairy when young and the petals not remaining on the fruit. Distribution and habitat * Subspecies anemonifolia grows in woodland and heath, often on exposed rocky outcrops on the coast and nearby tablelands from near Rylstone in New South Wales and south to the Brisbane Ranges in Victoria. * Subspecies aurifodina grows in low, open eucalypt woodland in a few areas in central Victoria. * Subspecies variabilis is the most widely distributed subspecies and grows in heath, open woodland or open forest in south-east Queensland, on the coast and ranges of New South Wales and in northern and south-eastern Tasmania. In Victoria it only occurs on two islands near Wilsons Promontory. * Subspecies wadbilligensis grows in eucalypt woodland or low heath on rocky outcrops and is only found on the Wadbilliga plateau in New South Wales.

This ancient temple, more than 600 years old, is situated at Karikkakom, around 7 km north of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram. The temple enshrines a Panchaloha idol of the goddess Karikkakathamma ‚Äì an incarnation of Chamundi. The rare fact about this temple is that Chamundi Devi is worshiped here in three different forms: Maha Chamundi, Raktha Chamundi, and Bala Chamundi. During the period of King's rule this temple was the venue for imparting justice and truth. Truth and justice were tested on oath and solemnization and the punishmentsf meted out accordingly. Main Shrine Chamundi Devi herself is considered a fierce form of Kali, but the same Chamundi Devi is worshipped here in three different forms in three different adjacent sanctums situated adjacently. An idol of the Devi is located in the extreme left main sanctum. Other shrines Though the cardinal deity is Chamundi Devi, Rektha Chamundi, Bala Chamundi, Sastha, Ganapathi, Yakshiyamma, Bhuvaneshvari, Ayiravalli and Yogeeswaran are also accommodated in the temple. Also, just to the north of the Devi Temple, there is an old house known as Guru Mandiram. This is believed to be the ancestral house or tharavad of the Yogeeswaran who brought Devi to this place. Rektha Chamundi On the right side of the Devi Nada is the Rakta Chamundi nada. There is no vigraha (idol) in this nada but only a wall painting of the Devi in a Rowdra Bhava. The Karikkakom temple has historical importance since this temple was utilized during the reign of the Maharajas to prove the truth of certain crimes. Accused culprits were brought to the temple and were allowed to proclaim their innocence in front of Raktha Chamundeswari's sanctum. They had to put 21 panam or coins in the nada and promise to tell the truth. The Devi was believed to protect them if they were truthful and punish them if they were not. So nobody dared to tell a lie in front of the deity. This nada was opened only for this particular ritual. The Chamundi Devi form in the main sanctum is considered as in a calm state, whereas Raktha Chamundi is considered as fierce, but helps devotees to fulfill their wishes. It is believed that if offerings and prayers are given to Raktha Chamundi Devi, she will remove obstacles and problems caused by enemies, cure chronic ailments, and so on. Bala Chamundi Bala Chamundi Devi, as the name suggests, is in childhood form. Couples without a child worship her and present articles like cradles and toys to be blessed with a child. Offerings given to the Devi also help cure ailments in children. Nagar kavu Outside the Devi Temple wall, the nagar kavu and pond belonging to the temple are located. This nagar kavu is rich in numerous varieties of trees and creepers as well as medicinal plants. To remove Sarpa dosha, devotees can offer Ayilya Pooja and Nurum palum, Archana for Nagar and more every month on the Ayilyam day. Pongala festival Devotees offering Pongala at Karikkakom Devi Temple in Thiruvananthapuram The annual festival is in the month of Meenam for seven days. Millions of women gather every year in the month of Meenam around this temple and prepare Pongala (rice cooked with jaggery, ghee, coconut as well as other ingredients) in the open in small pots to please the goddess. The idol of Devi is carried out in a golden chariot around the temple on the day before Pongala and thousands of devotees gather to witness it.  Other festivals  The other festivals in this temple are: # Mandala Vratham - Festival in connection with the annual Utsavam of Sabarimala # Vinayaka Chathurthi - Pooja to the Lord Ganapathy # Pooja Vaypu - Identical to Dussera festival (Saraswathy Pooja and Vidyarambham) # Sivarathri - Siva Pooja # Karthika - Karthika Deepam # Ayilya Pooja - Milk, flowers etc. offered to serpent God and special rites # Aiswarya Pooja - On all full moon (Pournami) days # Shasta Pratishta Dinam - Every year in the month of Makaram on the Rohini day Shasta Pratishta Dinam is celebrated in the temple. # Vishu Kani - On the first day of the month of Medam people come here for the Vishukani Darshanam. Special rituals Bali Sadhya This ritual takes place in the month of Karkatakam on the Karthika day. On this day inside the temple special poojas are performed for the Guru and Mantramoorthi. Brahmins are given food and dress. After this ceremony devotees are given Bali Sadhya. This is a very old custom of the temple, which is followed even today. Nirayum Puthiriyum The paddy taken from the land belonging to the temple is first offered to the Devi. Uthrada Taneerkuda This is another important festival conducted during the month of Chingam on Uthradam day. This is a very ancient and important pooja. Kodi Charthu This is a ritual conducted in the month of Chingam on Thiruvonam day after the Nirmalya Darshanam. The devotees offer the Devi yellow dress during the festival. Ayilyam Ootu The temple performs poojas for the Nagas on the ayilyam day in the month of Makaram. This is known as Vallya Ayilyam. From ancient times this pooja is performed for propitiating the Nagas and removing Naga Dosha. Transportation Karikkakom is just 7 km from Thiruvananthapuram city.

Biography  The construction of the Elisabeth Bridge in Kom√°rom, Hungary on the River Danube (today between the cities of Kom√°rom, Hungary and Kom√°rno, Slovakia) Gregersen was born on 17 April 1824 to farmer Nils Gregersen (1804‚Äì1868) and Anne Trulsdatter (1803‚Äì1838) in Modum, Norway. A young man and a crafter, Gregersen came to Budapest, Habsburg Empire in the 1850s, where he established a company within general contracting. After a few years, the company had become one of the leading in the Kingdom. Living in the town Szob, near to Budapest, Gregersen was married with Aloyzia (Luise) S√ºmegh (1836‚Äì1906), a daughter of Josef S√ºmegh and Katharina Stitz. They had 19 children together, of whom seven died as infants. Gregersen designed the Elisabeth Bridge between the two parts of the city of Kom√°rom, Austria-Hungary (today between the cities of Kom√°rom, Hungary and Kom√°rno, Slovakia. He also designed and lead the carpenter works on the building of the Hungarian Parliament and the Museum of Fine Arts and on the former building of the National Theatre in Budapest. In 1884 Gregersen with wife and (some) children were ennobled by Francis Joseph, Apostolic King of Hungary. They were also granted a coat of arms which, in the upper field, displays the Norwegian Lion. Gregersen died on 24 December 1910 in Szob, Hungary. He remained a Lutheran all his life.

However, despite this progress, gender inequality in the United States continues to persist in many forms, including the disparity in women's political representation and participation, occupational segregation, and the unequal distribution of household labor. The alleviation of gender inequality has been the goal of several major pieces of legislation since 1920 and continues to the present day. As of 2018, the World Economic Forum ranks the United States 51st in terms of gender equality out of 149 countries. In addition to the inequality faced by cisgender women, inequality, prejudice, and violence against transgender men and women, as well as gender nonconforming individuals and non-binary individuals, are also prevalent in the United States. Transgender individuals suffer from prejudices in the workforce and employment, higher levels of domestic violence, higher rates of hate crimes, especially murder, and higher levels of police brutality when compared to the cisgender population. Current issues for women Social attitudes More recent research in 2012 has found that attitudes towards gender and societal roles have changed very little since the mid-1990s, with attitudes hovering at about sixty to seventy percent egalitarian. This study theorized that a \\"egalitarian but traditional\\" gender frame emerged in popular culture during this period, which supports each gender assuming their traditional roles without appearing sexist or discriminatory, and is responsible for this backlash. Benevolent sexism, sometimes referred to as chivalry, which holds women as something to be protected, also has psychological effects. Women who hold these views are more likely to have less ambitious career goals and men who hold these views tend to have a polarized and stereotyped view of women, made up of both very favorable and very unfavorable traits. In such cases, the stereotyped view of women is \\"favorable in content and yet prejudicial in [its] consequences,\\" and attempts to provide justification for discriminatory behaviors presented as helpful or paternal. =Sexual assault= Research conducted at Lycoming College has found the enjoyment of sexist humor to be strongly correlated with sexual aggression towards women among male college students. In addition, studies have shown that exposure to sexist humor, particularly humor related to sexual assault, can increase male aggression and their tendency to discriminate against women. One study also asserted that the attitudes behind such humor creates an environment where such discriminatory and possibly violent behavior is acceptable. Men's tendency to self-report the likelihood that they would commit sexually violent acts has also been found to increase after exposure to sexist humor, as reported by researchers from the University of Kent. Political participation Women running for Congress The Center for American Women and Politics reports that, as of 2013, 18.3% of congressional seats are held by women and 23% of statewide elective offices are held by women; while the percentage of Congress made up of women has steadily increased, statewide elective positions held by women have decreased from their peak of 27.6% in 2001. Women also make up, as of 2013, 24.2% of state legislators in the United States. Among the one hundred largest cities in the United States, ten had female mayors as of 2013. In 1977, political science professor Susan Welch presented three possible explanations for this underrepresentation of women in politics: one, that women are socialized to avoid careers in politics; two, that women's responsibilities in the home keep them away out of both the work force and the political arena; and three, women are more often than men members of other demographic groups with low political participation rates. In 2001, M. Margaret Conway, political science professor at the University of Florida, also presented three possible explanations for the continuation of this disparity: one, similar to Welch's first explanation, sociological and societal norm discourages women from running; two, women less frequently acquire the necessary skills to hold a political leadership position from nonpolitical activities; and three, gatekeeping in party politics prevents women from running. Workplace Inequality The United States is falling behind other Western countries in the percentage of women engaged in the workforce. Researchers from the Institute for Women's Policy Research at the University of California Hastings College of Law argue that this growing gap is due to a lack of governmental, business and societal support for working women. They ranked the United States last out of 20 industrialized countries in an index that measured such programs as family leave, alternative work arrangements, part-time employment, and other means to make workplaces more flexible and family-friendly. The United States is also the only industrialized nation that does not have a paid parental leave policy mandated by law, and is one of only four countries worldwide that does not; in addition, fully paid maternity leave is only offered by around 16 percent of employers in the United States. =Sex discrimination in employment= Jane Wilke from the University of Connecticut found that men's support of the idea that men should be the sole source of income in a married couple decreased from 32 to 21 percent from 1972 to 1989; in practice only 15 percent of households were supported by a male spouse's income alone at the time of the study. Women continuously are being mistreated and sexually discriminated against explicitly in the workplace today. This has been an ongoing issue and will most likely continue until something changes in the occupational sphere. According to a study conducted by researchers at California State University, Northridge, when an individual with a PhD applies for a position at a university, that individual is significantly more likely to be offered a higher level of appointment, receive an offer of an academic position leading to tenure, and be offered a full professorship if they are a man when compared to a woman of comparable qualifications. However, these findings have been disputed, with multiple studies finding universities pushed to hire more women, resulting in females being given a 2:1 advantage over males in science, technology engineering and mathematics fields. Another study found that women were significantly less likely to receive a job offer or an interview for a high-paying waiter position when compared to equally qualified men; this study also found that such hiring discrimination may be caused in part by customer's discrimination of preference for male wait staff, but that it could not be concluded, since the male/female gap could be explained by the fact that more female waiters than male, such that the preferred hiring of male waiters could actually help equality. Similarly, research conducted at the University of California, Davis focusing on academic dermatology revealed a significant downward trend in the number of women receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health, which the authors concluded was due to a lack of support for women scientists at their home institutions. Research from Lawrence University has found that men were more likely to be hired in traditionally masculine jobs, such as sales management, and women were more likely to be hired in traditionally feminine jobs, such as receptionist or secretary. However, individuals of either gender with masculine personality traits were advantaged when applying for either masculine or feminine jobs, indicating a possibly valuing of stereotypically male traits above stereotypically female traits. =Occupational segregation by gender= Occupational gender segregation takes the form of both horizontal segregation (the unequal gender distribution across occupations) and vertical segregation (the overrepresentation of men in higher positions in both traditionally male and traditionally female fields). According to William A. Darity, Jr. and Patrick L. Mason, there is a strong horizontal occupational division in the United States on the basis of gender; in 1990, the index of occupational dissimilarity was 53%, meaning 53% of women or 47% of men would have to move to a different career field in order for all occupations to have equal gender composition. While women have begun to more frequently enter traditionally male-dominated professions, there have been much fewer men entering female- dominated professions; professor of sociology Paula England cites this horizontal segregation of careers as a contributing factor to the gender pay gap. Housework Cleaning a toilet in Sumas, Washington. Her comment: \\"Woman's work is never done: not very exciting for day 100. I worked all day. cleaned the toilet before I left for work. it was so gross i didn't even want to pee in it\\" US women spend over twice as much time on housework as men, averaging an extra 65 minutes per day (7.6 hours per week) . If the women are employed, or highly-paid, they don't do less housework. In fact, when women work or earn more than their husbands, they do more housework. This has been explained as a way to make their career success less threatening, and reassert traditional sexuality. US women are reluctant to delegate housework to men partly because they believe that it won't be done properly. Women are, on average, more concerned about undone housework, an attitude gap that has been attributed to socialization and societies that hold women responsible for the state of the home. In households and societies where gender equality is more highly valued, less time overall is spent on housework. Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family history at Evergreen State College, noted that one of the factors contributing to the gender inequality in the United States is that most men still expect women and men to assume traditional gender roles in the households and for women to carry out a larger share of the housework. This has been confirmed by a number of other studies; for example Makiko Fuwa from University of California, Irvine noted that while there has been movement towards greater equality, \\"in 1995 American women still spent nearly twice as much time on housework than men\\" and there is also a segregation of household tasks. This gendered division of household labor creates what is known as the second shift or double burden, where working women in a heterosexual couple with a working partner spend significantly more time on childcare and household chores. Researchers from the University of Maryland have found that while men have steadily begun to perform more household labor since 1965, most of the essential and traditionally feminine tasks are still carried out by women; men generally carry out more nonessential or infrequent tasks, such as taking out the trash or mowing the lawn. While both genders tend to have roughly equal amounts of leisure time, men have more uninterrupted leisure time when compared to women. Childcare Researchers from the University of Michigan have found that from 1970 to 1985, the percentage of men and women who supported traditional social roles for wives and believed that maternal employment damages mother-child relationships or children's development decreased. Working mothers tend to get less sleep when compared to their working husbands. =Pay gap= Women's median usual weekly earnings as percentage of men's, for full-time workers, by industry, 2009 With regards to the gender pay gap in the United States, International Labour Organization notes as of 2010 women in the United States earned about 81% of what their male counterparts did. While the gender pay gap has been narrowing since the passage of the Equal Pay Act, the convergence began to slow down in the 1990s. In addition, overall wage inequality has been increasing since the 1980s as middle-wage jobs are decreasing replaced by larger percentages of both high- paying and low-paying jobs, creating a highly polarized environment. However numerous studies dispute the claim that discrimination accounts for the majority of the pay gap. When adjusting for industries commonly chosen, \\"choices\\" often being the result of gender stereotypes, hours worked, and benefits received, the pay gap returns to 5%, which has been attributed to less aggressive pay negotiating in women. One study actually found that before 30, females made more than males, and hypothesized that choosing a family over a career resulted in the drop of the female wage advantage during the thirties. According to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, the primary cause of this gap is discrimination manifested in the tendency of women to be hired more frequently in lower paying occupations, in addition to the fact that male dominated occupations are higher paying than female dominated occupations, and that, even within comparable occupations, women are often paid less than men. In medicine, female physicians are compensated less, despite the fact that evidence suggest that the quality of care female physicians provide may be higher than that of male physicians. In addition to the gender pay gap, a \\"family gap\\" also exists, wherein women with children receive about 10-15% less pay when compared to women without children. According to Jane Waldfogel, professor of social work and public affairs at Columbia University, this family gap is a contributing factor to the United States' large gender pay gap. She also noted that men did not seem to be affected by this gap, as married men (who are more likely to have children) generally earned higher than unmarried men.  Racial Pay Gap  The gender pay gap has continued to grow throughout the years due to a plethora of reasons. The gender pay gap refers to the median annual pay of all woman who work full-time and year-round, thus compared to the pay of a similar background of men. There is not one reason behind this gender pay gap, rather the pay gap is a result of many factors. Another topic of discussion regarding the gender pay gap is the racial pay gap that exists in our country today. Not only are women discriminated against for their gender, but also women are discriminated against for their race. The racial pay gap in the workplace is just another aspect of the pay gap issue that our society needs to overcome as soon as possible. Overall, different groups of women experience distinct gaps in pay in the workplace due to solely their race.  Asian  Generally, among women of all ethnicities and races, the hourly earnings of Asian and white women tend to be higher than African American and Hispanic women A 2016 study by the Pew Research Center reported that Asian women, on average, receive about 18 dollars an hour, while white women earn 17 dollars, African American women get 13 dollars, and Hispanic women receive 12 dollars. The study also found that in 2015 Asian women earned about 87 cents per dollar earned by white men in median hourly earnings. About 45 percent of Asian American mothers provide nearly 40 percent of their families' income, making these households reliant on this income.  Hispanic  Female Hispanic women earn wages far less than their women and male counterparts. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research, in 2017, the median salary for a white male was $60,388, $46,513 for white women, and 32,002 for Latina women. They earn the lowest among all ethnicities including Asian and Black women workers. In 2017, for every 1 dollar a white male worker earns, a Hispanic woman earns 53 cents. Whereas, the white female employee makes 80.5 cents for each dollar a man makes. That is 47 percent less than white males and 31 percent less than white females. The Institute for Women's Policy Research stated that in 2016, 31.2 percent of Latina women were unmarried and the primary provider for their family and 21.3 percent were married and still the families' primary source of income. This struggle to provide, while earning low salaries, interferes with affording childcare services, and taking off days from work to take care of themselves or their children. Some of the most attractive jobs for Latinas includes retail and customer service. In sales, the median wage for white men is $20.12, whereas Latinas earn $11.44. In customer service, they earn $14.24, while their male counterparts earn $19.89. Hispanics put aside a day called \\"Latina Equal Pay Day\\", usually in November, that spreads awareness about the fact that Latinas have to work 10 months longer than a white male to make as much money as them. In terms of educational level, Latinas make less than the average white women. According to AAUW, the weekly income of white women with a bachelor's degree is $1,031, and Hispanic women with the same degree earn $915. No matter the education level, they earn less than their white female counterparts.  Native American  The pay gap between women and men is clearly evident. However, the several subgroups that pertain to women show how race, alongside gender, cause innate disadvantages in the workplace for certain individuals. In general, a woman would have to work nearly four extra months per year in order to earn the same annual salary an average man receives. For Native American women specifically, equal pay would not be received for an extra nine months per year. This notion is supported by the fact that the average Native American female earns approximately $0.58 per every individual dollar a white male earns. In comparison, a white woman earns $0.77 per each dollar earned by a white male. Historical wage disparities that derived from the unequal treatment of races from years prior still persist. This is argued as dangerous because it can also stem from the unequal placement of racial groups in specific neighborhoods, thus resulting in inferior education. In turn, this can be one of the causes, alongside discrimination, for why Native American women experience a larger than normal wage disparity. As well, this continues neighborhood association causes a continuous cycle of a more impoverished lifestyle for Native Americans. The annual wage gap between a Native American woman and a white woman is approximately $24,443. Given the fact that woman in general are already at an alarming wage gap compared to men, this large number indicates a serious disparity and large role race also plays in wage disparities within genders. As a benchmark, the median annual pay in the United States for a full-time, year round working Native American woman is $33,571. This, alongside the fact that 67% of Native American mothers are breadwinners, or in other words the person who's wages support the family, shows how the wage disparity has a direct effect on the impoverished lifestyle of certain racial groups.  Caucasian  The pay gap between Caucasian women and Caucasian men is substantial. In 2018, the median weekly pay for all Caucasian women with full-time job was $789 while the median weekly pay for men was $973. These numbers depict that on average, white women make around 81% of what white men do. While these numbers clearly describe the inequality between white men and white women, the pay gap between them is much closer than other races including Hispanic, Native American, American Indian and Native Hawaiian. New awareness of gender inequality in the workplace has caused the annual earnings for women to increase by 1.6% from 2016‚Äì2017. While women's median annual earnings may not increase significantly every year, it is generally on an upward trend. One of the biggest factors that leads to the gap between white men and women is parenting. While many white women are staying home to take care of their family, men are continuing to work and earn money. When white women eventually go back to work, their average earnings decrease around 39% compared to women who were not parenting a child. If the government were to implement free child care services, women would have a greater opportunity to work. Despite the gradual decrease in pay gap between men and women, the government needs to implement more laws so that this pay gap eventually disappears. A big difference in the salary earnings between Caucasian men and women is due to job titles and experience. Despite these differences, studies have shown that women will make $.98 to every man's $1 even if they have the same exact job title and experience. This is a prime example of the inequalities Caucasian women face in the workforce. Despite all of these inequalities for Caucasian women in the workplace, there are many ways to reduce the pay gap. One way the government can help women even the playing field would be to add mentoring programs. These programs could help women negotiate their salaries and working conditions.  African American  As of 2017, African American women make 61 cents to the white man's dollar. This is much lower than the earnings ratio for all women in this country, which is 80 cents to the white man's dollar. According to data from the Economic Policy Institute, the median earnings of full-time, full- year workers for black men is about $5,000 higher than the earnings of Black women. So even within their own race they also receive the lower end of the stick. In the top 25 states with the largest numbers of Black women working full-time, year-round, the pay compared to white men ranges from about 48 to 68 cents for every dollar. For example, in places like Washington, D.C. and Mississippi, Black women still only make 55 cents to the white man's dollar even though they have the highest share of full-time working black women. The Black female pay disparity is worth paying attention to because 80% of Black women are the sole source of income in their households. 4 million Black women are reported to be the heads of their households. Of this 4 million, 1.2 million are living below the poverty line. There are many reasons why these disparities exist. Black women are more likely to be found occupying lower paying service jobs than any other demographic, meaning that the chances of finding them in engineering or managerial positions, higher paying jobs, is very slim. Only 2.2% of all board seats in Fortune 500 companies are held by Black women. Very few black women advance to executive leadership positions due to lack of finding other black women in those positions to be a mentor or to network with, which is something that their white counterparts have more access to. Black women also report dealing with micro-aggressions and workplace harassment at high rates due to their race or to their sex by colleagues in the workplace . They constantly feel like they have to outwork or outperform their work counterparts in order to seen as equal in the work place. These barriers prevent African American women from occupying the working positions that they need to get to higher, better paying positions in this country. Education Literacy and enrollment in primary and secondary education are at parity in the United States, and women are overrepresented in tertiary education. There is, however, a notably gender segregation in degree choice, correlated with lower incomes for graduates with \\"feminine\\" degrees, such as education or nursing, and higher incomes for those with \\"masculine\\" degrees, such as engineering. Females started outnumbering males in higher education in 1992. = Gender inequality in elementary and middle schools = To study gender inequality in elementary and middle schools, researchers from NYU and Indiana University used data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, specifically the 1998 to 1999 and 2010 to 2011 cohorts. When comparing average math test scores of boys and girls in kindergarten, they did not discover an average gender gap. However, when looking at data from students in second or third grade, the researchers discovered that boys perform better on the math tests (by a standard deviation of 0.25 average gender gap). The researchers also found that when teachers were asked to compare a boy and a girl of the same socio-economic status and race who received the same scores on math tests and had similar behavioral records in school, teachers overwhelmingly stated that the boy had superior mathematical abilities, a finding replicated in a study over a decade later. It is therefore possible that the gender gap in mathematical abilities among kindergarteners could be much less apparent in the United States today if teachers exhibited less gender bias in evaluating students' abilities, as evidenced by these replicated studies that demonstrate a systematic undervaluing of girls' mathematical abilities by teachers, which has likely contributed to a false perception of girls' abilities as being lower than test scores would indicate. From kindergarten through college, girls on average spend more time studying and receive better grades than their boy peers. However, 95% of the executive directors and CEOs in the largest public companies in the United States remain men. Researchers believe that this stark gender disparity is due to a lack of confidence in girls rather than a lack of competence. Most men, even those who may be underprepared or less qualified, never hesitate to pursue leadership roles or advancement in their careers. However, most women, even those who are overly qualified and overly prepared hold back from pursuing leadership roles or advancement. This lack of confidence in girls stems from their early years of education. Starting in elementary school, boys will often do the minimum amount of work needed to pass. When boys succeed in school by putting in a very small amount of effort, they become extremely confident in their abilities. During elementary, middle, and high school, boys continue to become more confident in their abilities and rely on their intelligence to succeed. However, girls slave over their homework, notes, and study materials until they are absolutely perfect. For example, girls will complete extra credit even when they have an A+ in the class. Especially as they enter middle and high school, girls become extremely anxious about their schoolwork and devote hours and hours to perfecting their assignments and acing their tests. Some stress is normal and healthy, however, being overly-stressed at all points of the day (as many young girls are) is not healthy. As adolescent girls work vigorously on their homework assignments, they develop competence but not confidence. Girls will attribute their success to external factors while boys will attribute their success to their own intelligence. In the workforce, confidence often goes farther than competence. When girls enter the workforce, they are competent in their field, but lack confidence to seek promotions or advancement. Thus, the lack of female leadership roles is partially due to the socialization of girls and boys beginning in elementary school. When favoritism occurs in the classroom, the majority of teachers declare they do not purposefully favor one gender over another. Research demonstrates that teachers end up silencing girls in their classes. Oftentimes, girls are rewarded in school for good behavior. Usually, this means sitting silently and attentively in class. However, these types of rewards can have very negative societal consequences. When girls are taught to be silent in class, they will often remain silent in the greater years of their life. The fact that young girls are commended to be silent may be the reason that they do not speak up when they are older, especially in serious cases such as sexual assault. Research also shows teachers divide time unequally between boys and girls. They ask boys more questions, provide them with more feedback, and allow them to speak out of turn more often. Conversely, teachers do not call on girls as much, which causes them to raise their hands less frequently. Research shows that teachers will spend 65% more of their time speaking with male students than female students. Additionally, they will allow boys to interrupt girls more often than they allow girls to interrupt boys. At the same time, girls are praised for being orderly and quiet in class. Research has also found that teachers give boys more chances to exhibit their knowledge to the class and they will often look at boys (instead of girls) after posing a question to the class. For female students of color (specifically African American female students), the problem is even worse. African American female students are 6 times more likely to be disciplined in school than white female students. They are often told that they are \\"defiant\\" and \\"disobedient\\". These biases that girls face from such a young age engrain an understanding in their mind that gender inequality is normal. During a study of almost 20,000 young students, only 8% of females and 4% of males favored female leaders in politics. The results of this study demonstrate that from such a young age, girls are trained to believe that men are better leaders than they are. This knowledge never leaves them and hurts them as they enter the workforce. Additionally, dress code is a school policy that has very serious emotional consequences for young girls. They feel as though they are constantly being judged, especially by male faculty members. In this case, when boys watch girls receive praise for being silent, they begin to always expect silence from their female classmates. When boys speak up the most in class, they start to internalize the idea that their opinions are more important than their female classmates' opinions, and they begin to internalize the idea that it is okay to interrupt girls in class. So often in our society, girls receive signals from an early age that they are not good at math, or that boys are simply better. This can occur at home, when wives ask their husbands for help when it comes to math. In 2013, women received 57% of all bachelor's degrees, however they only received 43% of math degrees, 19% of engineering degrees, and 18% of computer science degrees. At school and at home, many young girls receive the message that they either \\"have the math gene or they do not.\\" When a mother tells her daughter that she wasn't good at math in school, oftentimes, the daughter's mathematical achievement will decrease. Oftentimes, women do not realize they are sending these messages to their daughters. = Gender differences in degree choices = Specific to university and college campuses, gender inequalities can be seen when looking into the demographics of particular majors. This initial entrance into a particular field of study is shaped by an individual's desires to take a certain set of classes, leading to somewhat specific career opportunities and subsequently, salaries. When exploring the depths of college majors, there is a tendency for each gender to cluster into certain majors. These stereotypical \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine\\" degrees are key indicators to the inequalities women face in certain fields, specifically within the sciences and mathematics. Based on the Department of Education collections of data from the College Class of 2015, \\"women earn the large majority of degrees in health professions, psychology, education, English and communication, while men earn the large majority of degrees in engineering, computer science, and theology.\\" These exact percentages can be seen in the table distributed by the Department of Education, exemplifying the overall majority men have in the STEM field. Although not designated for specific genders, majors and minors at universities and colleges carry different stigmas for who should/shouldn't be part of the program. The results of Sylvia Beyer's 1995 study surveying 154 female and 111 male students from the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, to test the accuracy of gender stereotypes, conclude that students believe men and women are concentrated in different fields and that specific majors are deemed \\"masculine\\" and \\"feminine.\\" The participants categorized the masculine majors with computer science, chemistry, business, history, and mathematics, while they placed the feminine majors as psychology, communication, music, and art. These perceptions may not accurately describe the gender percentages in each field, but prove that men are more likely to be seen in STEM concentrations than women. Additionally, Yale researchers have published studies which prove that young male scientists are more likely to be favored than female scientists with the same candidacy. As of 2013, only of Physics PHDs were awarded to women and only 14% of physics professors were female. A large factor in the major and minor inequalities seen at the college level come from the encouragement of peers and educators to go forth in certain subjects. Ultimately, women are not receiving the same support and backing as their male counterparts, and thus, do not pursue STEM fields. Since a large sum of money lies in these occupations, women are not receiving an equal share, further perpetuating gendered salary inequalities. = Gender inequality in graduate school expectations = According to researchers at the University of Mississippi, undergraduate women have higher rates of expected educational attainment than men at the bachelors, masters, professional, and PhD degree levels. Women also report higher rates of marriage, desire to be married, parenthood, and lower average age of expected marriage. The study links these higher rates of a desire to have children with higher expectations for educational attainment at the masters and professional degree levels for females. Respondents who indicate they are likely to stay at home to help care for their children are less likely to expect a master's degree, professional degree, or PhD compared to those expecting to solely acquire a bachelor's degree. The latter category of respondents contains higher rates of women than men (by a ratio greater than 10:1) due to societal norms in the United States for women to take care of children in the family. Child-rearing may account for a contributing cause of inequality in educational outcomes among men and women in the United States. The research shows negative associations between both marriage and expectations of achieving a master's degree or PhD, and having children and expectations of achieving professional degrees or PhDs for women, but not men. A larger positive association was found between anticipated age at parenthood and an expectation to achieve a graduate or professional degree for women than for men. The relationship between expected age of marriage and expectation to achieve a PhD was also higher for women. While women earned a majority of total graduate school degrees in 2016 (57.5% female compared to 42.5% male), men still earned more graduate degrees among higher-paying disciplines, such as in business (54.9% male compared to 45.1% female), engineering, (75.3% male compared to 24.7% female) and mathematics and computer science (68.5% male compared to 31.5% female). = Gender inequality in representation at elite institutions = Women have recently surpassed men in the ratio of students enrolled in colleges around the nation. In 2017, women were awarded a majority of doctoral degrees, at 53%, for the ninth year in a row. With striking progress from the late 1900s, gender inequality in higher education persists with the consideration of female representation at elite universities. The higher representation of women is largely attributed to schools with \\"higher acceptance rates, lower faculty/student ratios, lower standardized test scores, and lower fees\\"; thus, underrepresentation still persists amongst the top schools in the nation. The effects of a less-notable degree proceed to play out in the workplace and job recruiting processes. Scholars have reasoned this inequality to be the effect of part-time enrollment and the advanced engineering characteristic of elite universities. With fewer females enrolling in STEM programs, they are less likely to attend universities notable for these programs. Other scholars argue that gender inequality at elite institutions is not an issue of access, accrediting the issue to decentralized school systems, such as the existence of female-only universities (which individually draw a large segment of women attending college). = Gender inequality in faculty = Women in academia face many challenges in terms of pay, rank, and composition in faculty. Although female faculty members' salaries are gradually increasing, the pay gap continues to widen or remain unchanged. The reason for this lies in the fact that male faculty members already earn significantly more than their female counterparts. The wage gap is greatest in private independent colleges. The explanations that have been brought forward for this persistent disparity relate to women's positions in institutions and disciplines. Within doctoral-granting institutions, containing the highest salary scales, women are outnumbered two to one. Women are extremely underrepresented in high-paying academic disciplines, like science, business, and law, yet overrepresented in low-paying fields, such as English, romance languages, and education. Not only is there a gap in salary but rank as well. Research has shown that top universities average only 34 percent female in full-time faculty. The disparity only worsens as faculty rank increases. Within top universities, the only category in which female faculty hold the higher proportion is \\"Non-Eligible for Tenure.\\" In universities overall, men continue to make up a disproportionate ratio of full professors, while women make up a majority of assistant professors, instructors, and lecturers. Though major strides have been made in increasing female faculty salaries and drawing attention to the issue, action must still be taken to further the progress. Health care Gender inequality is still seen in health care, in cases of women seeking emergency room care for serious conditions such as stroke and heart attacks they are 33% more likely to receive a misdiagnosis in comparison to men (Miller). On top of receiving incorrect treatment, when seeking treatment for autoimmune disorders which affect more women than men. It takes an average of seeking care from five different doctors and a span of 4 years to receive a diagnosis (Miller). Women's health has come a long way and with help from the FDA and NIH making new policies to include more research gender specific for women, the gap is slowly closing. Current issues for men Achievement gap in school For the past fifty years, there has been a gap in the educational achievement of males and females in the United States, but which gender has been disadvantaged has fluctuated over the years. In the 1970s and 1980s, data showed girls trailing behind boys in a variety of academic performance measures, specifically in test scores in math and science. Data in the last twenty years shows the general trend of girls outperforming boys in academic achievement in terms of class grades across all subjects and college graduation rates, but boys scoring higher on standardized tests and being better represented in the higher-paying and more prestigious STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). Graduation rates According to recent data (from 2007), 55 percent of college students are females and 45 percent are males. From 1995 until 2005, the number of males enrolled in college increased by 18 percent, while the number of female students rose by 27 percent.Digest of Education Statistics 2007 Males are enrolling in college in greater numbers than ever before, yet fewer than two-thirds of them are graduating with a bachelor's degree. The numbers of both men and women receiving a bachelor's degree have increased significantly, but the increasing rate of female college graduates exceeds the increasing rate for males. A higher proportion of men (29.4%) hold bachelor's degrees than women (26.1%). In 2007, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 18,423,000 males ages over the age of 18 held a bachelor's degree, while 20,501,000 females over the age 18 held one. In addition, fewer males held master's degrees: 6,472,000 males compared to 7,283,000 females. However, more men held professional and doctoral degrees than women. 2,033,000 males held professional degrees compared to 1,079,000, and 1,678,000 males had received a doctoral degree compared to 817,000 females.U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement 2007. Selective service Congressman Alexander Pirnie (R-NY) drawing the first capsule for the Selective Service draft, December 1, 1969. In the United States, most male US citizens and residents must register with the Selective Service System within 30 days of their 18th birthday. Those who fail to register may be punished by up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, although no non- registrants have been prosecuted since January 1986. They may also be ineligible for federal student financial aid, federal job training and federal employment, and for certain states, state employment and even driver's licenses. Suicide In the United States, the male-to-female teenage suicide death ratio is estimated at 3:1. Typically males are three to five times more likely to commit suicide than females. The reported difference in suicide rates for males and females is partially a result of the methods used by each gender. Although females attempt suicide at a higher rate, they are more likely to use methods that are less immediately lethal. Males frequently complete suicide via high mortality actions such as hanging, carbon-monoxide poisoning, and firearms. This is in contrast to females, who tend to rely on drug overdosing. The higher male suicide rate is also associated with traditionally masculine norms such as hyper-independence, reluctance to seek help, emotional unexperessiveness and social exclusion, according to all the available research on the matter. A research paper done by the Portland University provided evidence that the risk of male suicide could be social environmental factors (unemployment, discrimination, poverty), homophobic alienation, and stressful jobs. The traditional male roles in combination with psychosocial stress are some of the main causes of the male suicide epidemic. Divorced men are 2x as likely to commit suicide as married men, whereas for women there is no statistically significant difference in the risk of suicide by marital status categories. Male suicide became especially apparent in the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased male suicide exponentially due to the vast increase in unemployment, joblessness, relationship strains, and failure at work. Homelessness At least 70% to 85% of all homeless are men.The 2015 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress However, it is estimated that there is a larger female homeless population than counted, due to the fact that many women who would be considered homeless do not identify themselves as homeless and are not seen with groups of homeless people or in homeless shelters, because they fear that they will face increased chances of being sexually assaulted. Occupational segregation into dangerous jobs Men are over-represented in dangerous jobs. The industries with the highest death rates are mining, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and construction, all of which employ more men than women. In one U.S. study, 93% of deaths on the job involved men, with a death rate approximately 11 times higher than women. Disproportionate victimization from police brutality Men are vastly overrepresented in police shootings. According to a study done by Frank Edwards, Hedwig Lee, and Michael Esposito, the lifetime risk of being killed by police as a man in the United States is about 52 out of 100,000 (for black men it is nearly 1 in 1000); whereas for women, it is only 3 out of 100,000. After controlling for legal and extralegal characteristics, a study done by the journal Justice Quarterly found that young, black and Hispanic males are at increased risk for citations, searches, arrests, and uses of force by the police. Biases in the criminal justice system According to a study done in 2014, men (on average) receive 63% longer sentences for the same crime than women do. A meta-analysis done on experimental research about mock jurors found that it was advantageous for defendants (in sentencing) to be physically attractive, female, white, and of high socioeconomic status. After controlling for extensive criminological, demographic and socioeconomic variables, a paper done by the University of Georgia found that blacks, males and offenders with low education and low income receive substantially longer sentences. After analyzing data from 9,966 felony theft cases and 18,176 felony assault cases in California, a large gender disparity was found when females were more likely to similar males (and minorities) to get charge reductions and probation. A multivariate analysis done by the United States Sentencing Commission found that women of all races get much lighter sentencing than white male offenders. Other papers have confirmed the hypothesis that women get significantly more lenient sentences than men in the criminal justice system. Current issues for transgender people Visibility, awareness, and public attitudes One of the largest factors that causes and perpetuates transgender inequality is a lack of understanding and awareness among cisgender people. A 2002 survey found that, of the American respondents polled, only 70% had heard of the term transgender, while 67% agreed that it is possible for a person to be born as one gender, but inside feel like another gender. In addition, the survey found that 61% of Americans believe that the country needs anti-discrimination laws to protect transgender individuals, 57% incorrectly believed that it was not legal to fire someone on the basis of their gender identity if they are trans, 53% believed being transgender was acceptable while 37% did not, 77% believed that transgender students should be allowed to attend public school, and 8% said they would refuse to work with a transgender co worker. A 2012 study found that the heterosexual cisgender individuals who believe there are natural binary genders and there are natural differences between men and women are more likely to have negative attitudes toward transgender individuals. Events in the LGBT+ community such as Transgender Awareness Week and the International Transgender Day of Visibility are focused on educating and informing the public about transgender individuals and the challenges they face. Legal rights According to the Transformative Justice Law Project of Illinois, transgender people are \\"over-represented in the criminal legal system due to institutionalized oppression and increased poverty and criminalization.\\" Many transgender individuals have difficulties correcting their name and gender on their ID and personal documents. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, \\"only one-fifth (21%) of transgender people who have transitioned in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey have been able to update all of their IDs and records with their new gender and one-third (33%) had updated none of their IDs or records. At the time of the survey, only 59% had been able to update their gender on their driver's license or state ID; 49% had updated their Social Security Record; 26% their passport; and just 24% their birth certificate.\\" In addition, those transgender people who are successful in correcting their ID and records often must undergo heavy invasions of privacy, including presenting proof of gender reassignment surgery, and those who cannot correct their identification documents often face higher levels of discrimination, since it effectively \\"outs\\" them as transgender. Some state appellate courts- including Kansas, Ohio, Texas, Florida, and Illinois- have upheld that the gender an individual is assigned at birth is their legal gender for life, even if the individual has undergone gender reassignment surgery or similar treatments, and therefore refuse to acknowledge the gender that transgender people identify as. There have been several legal cases in which transgender parents have lost custody and other parental rights on the basis of their gender. There have also been cases of the validity and legality of married heterosexual couples in which one partner is transgender being contested and, in some cases, the marriage has been voided. Work life and economics A 2007 study reported that between fifteen and fifty-seven percent of transgender individuals report some kind of employment discrimination; of these thirteen to fifty-six percent reported being fired due to their gender identity, thirteen to forty-seven percent reported that they were denied employment due to their gender identity, twenty-two to thirty-one percent reported harassment due to their gender identity, and nineteen percent reported being denied promotion due to their gender identity. Another study found that transgender respondents reported twice the national rate of unemployment, while transgender people of color reported four times the national rate of unemployment. This study also found that 90% of respondents reported some kind of workplace harassment, mistreatment or discrimination. =Transgender pay gap= According to the American Psychology Association, around 64% of transgender people have annual incomes of less than $25,000. Another study found that transgender individuals are nearly four times more likely to make less than $10,000 annually when compared to the general population; on the other end of the spectrum, only 14% of transgender respondents reported making more than $100,000 annually compared to 25% of the general population. In addition, transgender women reported their wages decreasing by nearly one-third following their gender transitions but transgender men reported their wages increasing slightly (about 1.5%), according to one study. Social life Since many public spaces, including schools, are highly gendered with features such as gendered bathrooms and locker rooms, transgender people often face violence in these gendered areas. Transgender people are often asked to present their ID or other invasive question when using a public restroom designated for the gender they identify as and can often face discrimination and violence if their ID has not been correct or if they do not \\"pass\\" as the gender they identify as. One study found that 71% of transgender respondents made efforts to hide their gender or gender transition to avoid discrimination, while 57% reported delaying their gender transition to avoid discrimination. Transgender individuals also face discrimination within the LGBT+ community, especially from cisgender gay men and lesbians. As a result, they often do not receive the same social support from the community that other queer individuals do. Education One study found that 78% of transgender individuals interviewed reported harassment in primary or secondary school, 35% reported physical assault, 12% reported sexual violence, and 6% reported being expelled. According to the study, the effect of this harassment was so severe that 15% of the respondents were forced to leave school at either the primary, secondary, or tertiary level. Transgender individuals also face barriers when applying to higher education, as was the case with a transgender woman rejected from the all-girls Smith College because she was not legally recognized as female in her home state. Health and violence Transgender individuals, especially transgender women, are at a high risk of suffering from domestic abuse due to invisibility, lack of access to support facilities such as shelters, and a lack of legal and social protection. Transgender individuals are also more likely to be sexually and physically assaulted, both by strangers and acquaintances, than cisgender individuals are. In addition, there are several factors that limit transgender people's access to health care facilities and proper medical care, including transphobia and the tendency of gender-segregated homeless and domestic violence shelters to refuse service to transgender and gender nonconforming individuals. The Anchorage Equal Rights Commission lost a lawsuit to force a woman's shelter to admit a transgender woman. One study reported that 19% of transgender individuals interviewed reported being refused medical care due to their gender identity, while 28% reported being harassed in a medical setting and 2% reported violence toward them in a medical setting due to their gender identity. In the same study, 50% percent of transgender respondents reported the need to educate their medical providers about the health care needs of transgender individuals. Transgender individuals also reported four times the national average of HIV infections when compared to cisgender individuals in one study conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. The NCAVP's 2012 Report on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-affected Hate Violence reported that over fifty percent of anti-LGBTQ homicide victims in 2012 were transgender women, a considerable increase from the percentage of transgender women victims in 2011 at 40%. In addition, the report also found that, compared to cisgender people, transgender people were more than three times more likely to experience police violence. In terms of mental health, transgender individuals have much higher rates of suicide attempts than cisgender individuals and it has been reported that between nineteen and twenty-five of the trans population have attempted suicide. Government policy In 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which insured women's suffrage (although some individual states allowed women the right to vote as early as 1869), was ratified. In addition, the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor was created to monitor working conditions for women in the workforce. In 1961, the President's Commission on the Status of Women was started, initially chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt. This commission found that women were suffering considerable workplace discrimination. In 1963, the Equal Pay Act was passed, which made it illegal for a woman to be paid less than a man working in the same position. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 also made discriminatory hiring on the basis of gender illegal. The affirmative action policy of 1965 was expanded in 1967 to cover women as well as racial minorities. In 1973, women's right to safe and legal abortion was established by the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade. In 1968, sex-segregated job advertisements were declared illegal by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, this decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1973; this allowed women to apply for higher-paying jobs formally restricted only to male applicants. In 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments, which reads \\"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance,\\" was passed. In 1986, in the decision of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, sexual harassment was established as illegal and discriminatory. The Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 guarantees that new parents can retain their jobs for 12 weeks after the birth of the child; this unpaid leave is the only form of paternal leave protected by law in the United States. In 1994, the Violence Against Women Act provided legal protection, as well as funds and services, for rape victims and victims of domestic violence. United States v. Virginia established in 1996 that gender-based admission practices violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and establishing a separate all-female school would not suffice as an alternative to integrating an all-male school. Most recently, in 2009 the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 provides employees (usually female) who suffer from pay discrimination to file a complaint with the government. The Equal Rights Amendment, which reads, \\"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex\\", was first introduced to Congress in 1923 and successfully passed both houses of Congress in 1972. However, it failed to be ratified by an adequate number of states and died in 1982. The United States is one of only a few countries which have not ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (US has only signed the treaty). Rankings The World Economic Forum's Gender Gap Index for 2012 ranked United States 22nd best out of 135 countries for gender equality. The primary indicators for inequality were related to political empowerment, where the US was ranked 55th (32nd for women in ministerial position and 78th for women in parliament). USA was ranked 33rd for health and survival, 8th for economic participation and opportunity, and tied for 1st (no inequality) in education. Since the Gender Gap report was first published in 2006, the US position remains relatively stable in that index. However, the United States' score decreased between 2011 and 2012. United Nation's Gender Inequality Index (part of the Human Development Report) shows that the US scored 19% in gender inequality in 2017 ranking in the13th place out of 173 countries in terms of the Human Development Index. In addition, the OECD's Better Life Index discusses a number of differences, but does not stress any in particular when it comes to gender.

History The Left Faction was formed on 20 February 1952 (during the second Knesset) as a breakaway from Mapam in the aftermath of the Prague Trials. The show trials in which mostly Jewish leaders of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia were purged, falsely implicated Mapam's envoy in Prague, Mordechai Oren, as part of a Zionist conspiracy. This, and later Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech at the 20th Party Congress in the Soviet Union, led to Mapam moving away from some of their more radical left wing positions, and towards social democracy. Unhappy with the move, several Mapam MKs left the party; Moshe Aram, Yisrael Bar-Yehuda, Yitzhak Ben-Aharon and Aharon Zisling set up Ahdut HaAvoda-Poale Zion, Hannah Lamdan and David Livschitz created the Faction independent of Ahdut HaAvoda, whilst Rostam Bastuni (the first Israeli Arab MK representing a Zionist party), Adolf Berman and Moshe Sneh established the Left Faction.

He was a long-term member of parliament representing Phrae, leader of the United Thai Party and the Justice Unity Party. He was publicly known as the \\"godfather\\" (jao pho) of Phrae or even \\"godfather of the North\\".  Life and career  Narong Wongwan was born in Phrae, where his grandfather had acquired a fortune from wood production. Narong studied economics in the United States. After working for the family's saw mill for some time, he went into tobacco growing and curing in the 1950s. During the 1970s the tobacco business in Northern Thailand boomed and Narong became a multi-millionaire. Many peasants of Phrae and the neighbouring provinces were employed on Narong's and his family's plantations and in their curing plants. Therefore, he accumulated considerable economic and social influence in the region. This was used by him as a base for his political career. Narong was a member of Phrae's provincial council as early as 1949. He founded the United Thai Party and was elected member of parliament in 1979. He was steadily re-elected in all elections until 1992. He joined the government of prime minister Prem Tinsulanonda, becoming deputy interior minister in 1980, deputy minister of agriculture in 1981, rising to be minister in 1983. After the election of 1986, his party was in the opposition. In 1989, he merged his party with three minor parties and renamed it Solidarity Party. After a cabinet reshuffle, the party became part of Chatichai Choonhavan's government coalition and Narong was again made minister of agriculture. After the coup d'√©tat of 1991 and ahead of the election in March 1992, he joined other provincial businessmen, bureaucrats and supporters of the military coup group to form the Justice Unity Party, of which he became the chairman. The party won the election and Narong was designated prime minister, when media alleged that the United States had refused him entry admission due to the suspection of involvement in drug trafficking. The US government threatened that relations between the two countries could worsen in case that Narong became head of government. He had to relinquish premiership and the parliament instead nominated the putschist General Suchinda Kraprayoon. Really, Narong had not been prosecuted as there was not sufficient evidence. As the leader of the biggest coalition party, Narong still became deputy prime minister under Suchinda. After the bloody crackdown on the oppositional movement protesting against the military-backed government, the Justice Unity Party was discredited and dissolved. Narong instead joined the Thai Nation Party. After the party's electoral success in 1995, Narong was poised to become minister of interior, but again he was hindered by allegations of criminal activity. In 2000, Thailand's Supreme Court condemned the tabloid newspaper Khao Sot for spreading false allegations against Narong.

He was the youngest and longest surviving signatory of the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Interviews with Signatories of the Declaration. Meir Vilner, by Dan Izenberg. Born in Vilnius, German-occupied Lithuania, Vilner's political life began as the leader of the Marxist-oriented socialist-Zionist group HaShomer HaTzair (Young Guard). However, he soon grew disenchanted by what he viewed as a tendency in Zionist groups to dream of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, rather than change their current situation. Thus, he started working for the banned Polish Communist Party - now under the pseudonym Meir Vilner - until 1938, when he left Poland to go to the British Mandate of Palestine. Most of his family perished in the Holocaust. Vilner then studied history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In what would soon become Israel, Vilner was disenchanted with the politics, claiming that the hatred directed at Jews in Vilna was now directed at the Arabs. He joined the Palestine Communist Party (PCP), which accepted Arab and Jewish membership, and initially opposed partition of Palestine; in his testimony to the Anglo- American Commission of Inquiry in March 1946, he said that it would strangle economic development, strengthen the dependency of both states on the British and widen the gulf between Arabs and Jews. However he supported the 1947 UN Partition Plan after the Soviet position changed in 1947. Vilner criticized both the British and Israeli government, but justified signing the Israeli Declaration of Independence on the grounds that this would eliminate another British colony. Besides, the PCP stressed that the Charter contained a promise to help implement the UN resolutions providing for two independent states, Israel and Arab Palestine, and to uphold full equality and civil liberties for all Israeli citizens.Israeli Communist leader Meir Vilner dies at 84. By Hans Lebrecht. People's World, Jun 28, 2003. In 1949, he was elected to the Knesset as a member of Maki. He resigned from the Knesset in December 1959, six weeks after the 1959 elections, but was re-elected in 1961. However, he resigned again two months after the 1961 elections. As the Jewish leader of the Communist Party of Israel (CPI), 95% of whose members were Arabs, he rejected Zionism, publicised the Israeli nuclear weapons programme in 1963, and opposed the imposition of martial rule on Israeli Arabs (it was lifted in 1966). In 1965 Vilner and several other Maki members broke away from the party to form the new party Rakah following disagreements about the Soviet Union's increasingly anti-Israeli stance (Vilner was on the USSR's side), and was elected to the Knesset on the new party's list in the 1965 elections. On June 5, 1967, Vilner was the sole Jewish deputy (joined only by fellow Communist Party of Israel deputy Tawfik Toubi) to speak out in the Knesset against the Six-Day War. Calling that day the darkest in Israel's history, Vilner demanded an immediate halt to the Israeli invasion of Arab-occupied lands. Vilner stressed that there was no other way to solve the conflict between Israel and its neighbors but mutual recognition of the national rights of Israelis and Arabs, including the right of the Palestinians to self-determination and independent statehood. On October 15, he was badly wounded by a member of the right-wing party Gahal.Editorial: 40 years later. People's World, June 9, 2007.Israeli Red leader stabbed. The Daily Gleaner, October 16, 1967, p. 21. Rakah became part of Hadash before the 1977 elections, and Vilner remained an MK until 1990 when he resigned as part of a seat rotation agreement, making him the third longest serving after Tawfik Toubi and Shimon Peres. Vilner's Soviet loyalist line was highly appreciated by the USSR; in 1978 he was awarded the Order of Friendship of Peoples.https://eleven.co.il/article/10919 He did not accept perestroika and regarded the fall of communism in the USSR as a coup.

Born in Trieste, Luttazzi began playing the piano at Radio Trieste and composing his first songs when he was student in law at the University of Trieste during the Second World War. After the war, he had from SIAE a gain of 350,000 lire, a considerable sum for the time, so he decided to become a full-time composer and in 1948 he moved to Milan where he began working with fellow Teddy Reno at the record company CGD. He was among the first composers to place jazz structures in the Italian songs. A multifaceted artist, he worked in revues and cinema as actor and composer of soundtracks; he was also a successful television and radio presenter, and probably the peak of his popularity was the radio program Hit parade, one of the longest radio programs broadcast in Italy. In the early 1970s Luttazzi was involved together with Walter Chiari in a story of drug dealing; Luttazzi went to prison for a month before being acquitted with the formula \\"because the fact does not exist\\" but from then he basically semi-retired, leading a life reserved and returning rarely into the spotlight.

The group produce a variety of creative events from experiential environments, live concerts, festivals, immersive theatre, art exhibitions, arts awards, parties and masquerade balls. Early Events The group fronted by James Elphick curated a series of irregular happenings starting in April 2005 at The Corsica Studios encompassing live art, live music & performance art. These events gain equal measures of popularity and notoriety and culminated with their last event at the venue in early 2010. William S. Burroughs On Friday 28 March 2008 at The Synergy Centre in Oval, London, Guerrilla Zoo held an event in homage to the works of cult writer William S. Burroughs which marked a changing point in the direction of its events. The popularity of the experiential event which combined all the elements of previous events but within an immersive environment set the precedent for future shows. Interzone was influenced by the strange and seedy city of Interzone described by Burroughs in his books, inspired by his time living in the north Moroccan city of Tangier during the late 1950s. On Friday 7 February 2014 at Bunker 51 in North Greenwich, London, Guerrilla Zoo returned to Interzone to celebrate Burroughs centennial with a new experimental event, with blessing from his estate. Dazed and Confused Magazine cited it as \\"The ultimate centenary party for the late creative rebel\\". For ten days over August and September 2014, Guerrilla Zoo's artistic director James Elphick and Yuri Zupancic curated an exhibition entitled 'Animals in the Wall' featuring over 50 original artworks by William S Burroughs, alongside artists such as Brion Gysin, Shepard Fairey, Cleon Peterson and Matt Black of Coldcut, amongst others. The exhibition was premiered in Shoreditch at Londonewcastle Project Space. Alejandro Jodorowsky In November 2009 Guerrilla Zoo celebrated the work of iconic figure of the arts Alejandro Jodorowsky in a season presenting his work through theatre, film and music at venues in London. Events such as: The premi√®re of Alejandro Jodorowsky and his wife Pascale Montandon collaborative visual art at The Horse Hospital, also Brontis Jodorowsky starred in the solo production The Gorilla based on Franz Kafka's Report to an Academy at Leicester Square Theatre, and the first Modern Panic exhibition was held at The Old Abbatoir, plus many other Jodorowsky-related events. Modern Panic The Modern Panic series is inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky's Panic Movement and launched in 2009 originally as part of Season of Jodorowsky. The now annual exhibition features provocative and controversial international artists and live art's practitioners. It has established \\"a reputation for introducing new and edgy art\\" and been cited as \\"livening up modern art.\\" The Goblin King's Masquerade Ball In September 2010 Guerrilla Zoo launched a yearly themed and costumed ball which explores the darker side of fantasy. The Goblin King's Masquerade Ball features promenade theatre, interactive creatures, puppetry, art installations & site-specific immersive games alongside live music, performance and occasionally market traders. In part inspired by the British conceptual designer and artist Brian Froud and the trend of Renaissance events in USA. The event attracts large audiences from around UK and across Europe and has been featured on Arte TV. Make Believe Festival In May 2013 the Make Believe Festival was launched, a festival designed to explore the world of immersive experiential story-telling alongside traditional festival staples of live music and performance.

Prior to its creation, Aryeh Eliav had broken away from the Alignment and merged with Ratz to form Ya'ad. On 3 February the new faction was renamed the Independent Socialist Faction.

Early life and education Born in Washington, D.C., Abunimah spent his early years in the United Kingdom and Belgium before returning to the United States to attend college. His mother is originally from the village of Lifta, now part of Israel, but became a refugee in the 1948 Palestinian exodus. His father is from the village of Battir, now in the West Bank, and is a former Jordanian diplomat who served as ambassador to the United Nations.Ali Abunimah, 'Forward' to Rich Wiles, Behind the Wall: Life, Love, and Struggle in Palestine, Potomac Books, Inc., 2010 pp.8ff. According to his friend Max Blumenthal, in an article for the Mondoweiss website, part of the Abunimah family members say their forefathers came from Spain to Palestine following the expulsion of Muslims from Spain in 1492.Max Blumenthal, 'Spanish Jews resisted oppression in tunnels and, exiled, clutched their keys,' Mondoweiss 2 May 2015. Abunimah received degrees from Princeton University and the University of Chicago. He first began to participate in activism while at Princeton. While at the University of Chicago, his work as a researcher for a community-based organization resulted in encounters with that city's Arab community, with which he became actively involved.

Views on Israel and Palestine In 2009, Abunimah wrote an article entitled, \\"Israeli Jews and the one-state solution,\\" covering some of the same arguments as he raised in his book, One Country. Abunimah's position is that the two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict has \\"no chance of being implemented\\" and has been superseded by a \\"de facto binational state\\" under Israeli control. He supports the creation of a single democratic state, based on the equality of citizens and taking into account the legitimate concerns of Israel's Jewish population. Naomi Zeveloff has described Abunimah as \\"the leading American proponent of a one-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, which calls for a shared democratic state from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River. It is a state, in Abunimah's view, in which all residents of Israel and the territories it now occupies would enjoy equal rights and obligations. But in the eyes of his detractors, Abunimah's idea is tantamount to the destruction of the State of Israel, a proposal that would obliterate the Jewish character of the country in favor of majority Arab rule.\\" Abunimah opposes Zionism, which he describes as \\"a dying project, in retreat and failing to find new recruits.\\" He argues that Zionism's promotion of Jewish self-determination in Israel and Palestine's \\"intermixed population\\" has the effect of maintaining \\"a status quo in which Israeli Jews exercise power in perpetuity.\\" Abunimah's position is that Palestinians should pursue coercive measures against Israel such as the non-violent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (B.D.S.) movement, while also putting forward a positive vision of a single democratic state.Ali Abunmiah,, 'Why Israel won't survive,' Electronic Intifada, 10 November 2009. \\"Ultimately, I believe,\\" he wrote in January 2012, \\"the logic and inevitability of a single state will be accepted. As in South Africa and Northern Ireland, any just solution will involve a difficult and lengthy process of renegotiating political, economic and cultural relationships. But that is where the debate, unstoppably, is shifting.\\"Ali Abunimah, 'When the facts change, the solution should too,' New Statesman 18 July 2012. In a post on Electronic Intifada in January 2009, headlined \\"Why Israel Won't Survive,\\" Abunimah wrote that Israel was created by \\"the ethnic cleansing of Palestine‚Äôs non-Jewish majority Arab population,\\" and \\"has been maintained in existence only through Western support and constant use of violence to prevent the surviving indigenous population from exercising political rights within the country, or returning from forced exile.\\" Abunimah expressed his belief that the intention of the peace process was to normalize Israel as a Jewish state and gain Palestinian blessing for their own subjugation. He compared Israel to apartheid South Africa, saying Israel makes \\"South Africa's apartheid leaders look wise, restrained and humane by comparison.\\" In addition, he also approvingly cites comparisons of Israel to Nazi Germany made by Gerald Kaufman.Ali Abunimah, 'Why Israel won't survive,' The Electronic Intifada 19 January 2009. In 2010, he tweeted that \\"Supporting Zionism is not atonement for the Holocaust, but its continuation in spirit\\" and has also said \\"Zionism is one of the worst forms of anti-Semitism in existence today\\". He has acknowledged the potential for anti-Jewish violence in Israel should a one-state solution be realized, stating in a Q&A; at a 2009 conference at Hampshire College: \\"You can never have an absolute guarantee about what the future will be like. ... You cannot guarantee that if there was a one-state solution it wouldn't, it would be‚Ä¶the best scenario is if it's more in the direction of South Africa and Northern Ireland than Zimbabwe. But we couldn't rule out, you know, some disastrous situation, like Zimbabwe.\\"http://palestinevideo.blogspot.com/2009/11/campus-bds-conference-q- aliabunimah.Html Abunimah has given two theories about the strong relationship between the U.S. and Israel: first, he said Israel plays an important role in U.S. imperialism by allowing it to control the Middle East and their resources; second, he believes \\"there are powerful organizations and networks that consider support for Israel very important and they influence the politics of the United States through elections and contributions to political campaigns to make candidates adopt to Israel's position.\\" \\"The Arab-Zionist conflict did not begin in 1948 but rather long before it,\\" Abunimah maintained in a 2009 lecture. It began, he said, \\"when the Zionists came to Palestine in the beginning of the last century, and was exacerbated with the appearance of the refugee problem.\\" He made the following argument: \\"If for example the Jews returned to their original countries, those countries would be shocked, and those are their countries who exported them to Palestine. So how can these countries, most of which sing the praises of democracy and human rights, be silent about the right of return of the Palestinian people, the people and owners of the land, to their villages and cities?\\" He also claimed that \\"Zionism is strong, but it has not been renewed or rooted in the land of Palestine, and the Palestinians hold their land and identities dearly and are on their way to a majority.\\" The Great Book Robbery In an Electronic Intifada posting dated May 13, 2012, Abunimah praised the documentary film The Great Book Robbery, which \\"tells the story of the systematic looting in 1948 of tens of thousands of Palestinian books in a joint operation by the Haganah ‚Äì what became the Israeli army ‚Äì and the Israeli national library. ... Using eyewitness interviews, secretly shot footage, and historic images, and shots of the books themselves, The Great Book Robbery tells the story of the books and their owners, despite ongoing Israeli official denial. Gilad Shalit case Abunimah believed that Gilad Shalit ‚Äì an Israeli soldier captured in 2006 via cross-border Hamas raid into the Israeli town of Kerem Shalom, released in a prisoner exchange in 2011 ‚Äì should not have been considered a captive but rather a prisoner of war (POW). As such, he does not believe that Shalit would necessarily be entitled to an ICRC visit or contact with his family ‚Äì both of which Hamas routinely denied. Abunimah said that if he were to be considered a POW, his status would fall under the guidelines set forth at the Third Geneva Convention. Under these guidelines, the right of the ICRC to visit prisoners of war is never unconditional, and the ICRC never claims an unconditional right. Abunimah noted that the such visits are subject to the measure which the detaining powers consider essential to their security ‚Äì which is the justification given by Hamas for denying visitation. Allowing visits presents the risk of revealing the location of the Israeli POW, and would run the risk of an Israeli military attack. Hamas would not have been obligated to release any POW until the end of hostilities or until the POW is severely injured or in critical condition. Joshua Trevi√±o In an August 2012 article for Al Jazeera headlined \\"What's gone wrong at The Guardian?\\", Abunimah criticized the British newspaper's hiring of Joshua Trevi√±o as a political correspondent, calling Trevi√±o \\"a Republican party operative, paid political consultant and ideologue for hire\\" with a \\"propensity to call for violence.\\" His reference was to a June 2011 tweet by Trevi√±o about the Gaza flotilla: \\"Dear IDF: If you end up shooting any Americans on the new Gaza flotilla ‚Äì well, most Americans are cool with that. Including me.\\" Responding to this and several other articles and posts by Abunimah about Trevi√±o's hiring, the CiF Watch website cited Abunimah's tweet calling for a \\"third intifada\\" as evidence of \\"selective outrage\\" and \\"double standards.\\" The Guardian dropped Trevi√±o shortly thereafter. The Palestinian Authority \\"For years,\\" wrote Abunimah in a December 2012 article for Al Jazeera, \\"the PA has been equipped and trained under US supervision to act as an auxiliary for Israeli occupation forces to suppress any and all forms of Palestinian resistance, to beat and suppress Palestinians expressing their views and to arrest and harass journalists who dare to criticise it. ... The Abbas PA's record of collaboration with Israel, against the interests of the Palestinian people is long, shameful and well documented. It includes plotting secretly with Israel, the US and the former Mubarak regime in Egypt to overthrow the elected Hamas-led Palestinian Authority after 2006, colluding with Israel to bury the Goldstone report into Israel's war crimes in Gaza in 2008‚Äì2009, begging Israel not to release Palestinian prisoners so as not to give credit to Hamas, and more recently Abbas' public renunciation of the Palestinian right of return, a reflection of his longstanding position in negotiations.\\" West Bank settlements Debating Jonathan Tobin of Commentary on Democracy Now! in July 2012 about the legality of West Bank settlements, Abunimah argued that Israel's \\"violent settler colonial enterprise in the West Bank has no international legitimacy\\" and is \\"maintained through violence and a system of military apartheid.\\" He called the settlements \\"war crimes,\\" described the IDF as \\"Israel's Jewish sectarian militia,\\" and spoke of \\"the Jim Crow-like racism at the core of this Zionist ideology.\\" In answer to Tobin's argument that a necessary first step toward agreement on settlements is Palestinian recognition of Israel's right to exist, Abunimah said: \\"How can Palestinians ever possibly recognize or give legitimacy to an entity that views their mere reproduction as human beings as a mortal threat?\\" Third intifada Abunimah has publicly supported the idea of a third intifada. On January 20, 2012, he posted on Twitter: \\"Isn't it the time for a popular Palestinian revolution in the form of a third intifada?\\" He also supports the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, writing in the New Statesman in July 2012 that \\"Increasingly among Palestinians, the focus is shifting away from statehood towards a discourse on rights. Nowhere is this embodied more succinctly than in the 2005 Palestinian civil society call for boycott, divestment and sanctions on Israel. Without stipulating one state or two, this call demands the end of the Israeli occupation that began in 1967; recognition of the fundamental rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality; and that any outcome respect, protect and promote the rights of Palestinian refugees to return home.\\" Gaza Freedom March and Freedom Flotilla I Abunimah played a key role in the Gaza Freedom March in 2009, a joint effort with Codepink to bring humanitarian relief to Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Though he did not join the later Freedom Flotilla I voyage and was not part of the Free Gaza movement boat projects, Abunimah asserted that the participants in the flotilla had acted peaceably and that they did not intend to kill the IDF soldiers who boarded the ship. Brian Stelter of The New York Times commented in an article on June 1, 2010, that video evidence appeared to contradict Abunimah's account of events on the Mavi Marmara. Among the evidence were two videos which were uploaded by the North American Desk of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Spokesperson‚Äôs Office on May 31, 2010, and which show flotilla activists on the Mavi Marmara attacking Israeli soldiers attempting to board the ship. However, most of the video footage from passengers had been confiscated by the IDF. Footage that was smuggled out later clearly showed the commandos attacking the passengers. Abraham Foxman Abunimah accused Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League in August 2011 of having influenced the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik: \\"After Norway, Foxman may fear that the Islamophobic genie he helped unleash is out of control, and is a dangerous liability for him and for Israel.\\" Criticism of Gilad Atzmon In March 2012, Abunimah was among those Palestinian activists who signed a statement criticizing the views of Gilad Atzmon as racist and antisemitic. The signatories to the statement called for \\"the disavowal of Atzmon by fellow Palestinian organizers, as well as Palestine solidarity activists, and allies of the Palestinian people\\". Visit to Maghazi camp Abunimah visited the headquarters of the Popular Committee for Refugees in the Maghazi camp in the Gaza Strip in May 2013. He \\"expressed his overwhelming joy at being in the camp,\\" saying that the experience \\"reinforced his spirit of resistance.\\" Views on Barack Obama Abunimah met Barack Obama personally in 2004 when the latter was a member of the Illinois State Senate. Abunimah wrote in 2007 that he had met Obama around half a dozen times before Obama held elective office. The events were often at Chicago-based Arab-American and Palestinian events, including a 1998 fundraiser at which Edward Sa√Ød was the keynote speaker.How Barack Obama learned to love Israel Abunimah has since accused Obama of having cut off his relationships with American Arabs after his election to the U.S. Senate. \\"Obama said that he is sympathetic to the Palestinians,\\" Abunimah has declared, \\"but I do not believe that. ... I believe that he is political and he does not sympathize with the Palestinians in light of his recent positions and actions. He said he was sympathetic to the Palestinians because he needed their votes in order to be elected.\\" Abunimah has strongly criticized Obama's approach to Mid-East affairs, writing that the president has \\"entrenched\\" the policies of his predecessor, George W. Bush, and has not contributed to \\"even the pretense of a serious peace effort.\\"Ali Abunimah, \\"'Israel resembles a failed state'\\" [editorial], Al Jazeera English, 26 December 2009, 01:41. A 2007 article in New York's Jewish Week reported that Palestinian activist and Israel critic Rashid Khalidi had held an Obama fundraiser in his home when Obama was running for the House of Representatives, and quoted Abunimah as saying that Obama ‚Äúconvinced me he was very aware of the issues [and] critical of U.S. bias toward Israel and lack of sensitivity to Arabs....He was very supportive of U.S. pressure on Israel.'\\" Abunimah said on the TV and radio program Democracy Now! in 2008 that he had known Barack Obama \\"for many years as my state senator‚Äîwhen he used to attend events in the Palestinian community in Chicago all the time.\\" Abunimah added that he had introduced Obama in 1999 at a \\"community fundraiser for the community center in Deheisha refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. And that's just one example of how Barack Obama used to be very comfortable speaking up for and being associated with Palestinian rights and opposing the Israeli occupation,\\" Abunimah said. In May 2012, Abunimah wrote that the United States under Obama was leading a campaign \\"to close every door to justice for Palestinians,\\" and that his ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice is leading \\"a relentless anti-Palestinian crusade at the UN.\\" He also wrote that \\"the Susan Rices and William Hagues of the world are not only silent about these crimes, but fully complicit in them,\\" referring to the Palestinian hunger strikers in Israeli prisons.Slamming the door to justice on Palestinians Published work Abunimah wrote the book One Country: A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli- Palestinian Impasse, which proposes to revive the idea of one state shared by two peoples. Booklist wrote that \\"Abunimah's approach, inspired by ongoing reconciliation processes in South Africa (and, to a lesser extent, Northern Ireland), is fresh, energetic, and ultimately optimistic that those tired of violence will eventually gravitate toward an inclusive, unified Israel.\\" The International Socialist Review called the book \\"refreshing\\" and concluded that \\"In the struggle for liberation, we must never lose sight of what we are ultimately fighting for, no matter how far off it may seem. When many others have moved away from this discussion, Ali Abunimah's book refocuses it on the right goal, even if he's not clear about the path from here to there.\\" The Arab Studies Journal, noting that \\"any book proposing a one-state solution to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict\\" faces major challenges, such as \\"how to propose a vision of a shared future without papering over the history of injustice\\" and \\"how to instill hope without succumbing to naivete,\\" said that Abuminah \\"navigates these challenges admirably.\\" In response to the Gaza War Abunimah wrote an article in The Guardian headlined: \\"We have no words left\\". In the article, Abunimah commented about the end of the truce: \\"But what is Israel's idea of a truce? It is very simple: Palestinians have the right to remain silent while Israel starves them, kills them and continues to violently colonise their land\\" and \\"any act of resistance including the peaceful protests against the apartheid wall in the West Bank is always met by Israeli bullets and bombs. There are no rockets launched at Israel from the West Bank, and yet Israel's extrajudicial killings, land theft, settler pogroms and kidnappings never stopped for a day during the truce.\\" Abunimah said on the TV and radio program Democracy Now! in 2008 that he had known Barack Obama \\"for many years as my state senator‚Äîwhen he used to attend events in the Palestinian community in Chicago all the time.\\" Abunimah added that he had introduced Obama in 1999 at a \\"community fundraiser for the community center in Deheisha refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. And that's just one example of how Barack Obama used to be very comfortable speaking up for and being associated with Palestinian rights and opposing the Israeli occupation,\\" Abunimah said. Articles by Abunimah on the Palestinian issue have been published by The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Al Jazeera and other publications.

Red Guards were a transitional military force of the collapsing Imperial Russian Army and the base formations of Bolsheviks during the October Revolution and the first months of the Russian Civil War. Most of them were formed in the time frame of the Russian Revolution of 1917, and some of the units were reorganized into the Red Army during 1918. The Red Guards formations were organized across most of the former Russian Empire, including territories outside the contemporary Russian Federation such as Finland, Estonia, Ukraine, and others. They were not centralized and were formed by decision of a local political party and local soviet members. By fighting to protect and extend the power of the soviets, they aided the creation of a new state that (according to its original conception) would give \\"all power to the soviets\\": the Soviet Union. Overview Composing the majority of the urban population, they were the main strike force of several radically oriented socialist political factions. Red Guard units were created in March 1917 at manufacturing companies by Factory and Plant Committees and by some communist- inclined party cells (Bolsheviks, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, others). The Red Guards formations were based on the worker's strike forces of the Russian Revolution of 1905. Lenin gave a following evaluation of the phenomenon: A number of other militarized formations created during the February Revolution, such as \\"people's militia\\" (–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –º–∏–ª–∏—Ü–∏—è), created by the Russian Provisional Government, \\"squads of self-defence\\" (–æ—Ç—Ä—è–¥—ã —Å–∞–º–æ–æ–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã), \\"committees of public security\\" (–∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—ã –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏), \\"workers' squads\\" (—Ä–∞–±–æ—á–∏–µ –¥—Ä—É–∂–∏–Ω—ã) were gradually unified into the Red Guards. Creation On March 26, 1917, the Bureau of the Central Committee of the RSDRP(b) published a resolution \\"About the Provisional Government\\" since then the term, Red Guards, received the widest usage. The biggest centralized Red Guards formations were created in Petrograd and Moscow. Soon thereafter a series of attempts took place to legalize those formations. On April 14, 1917, the Moscow Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks) (RSDLP(b)) adopted a resolution for the creation of its Red Guard. On April 17 in Petrograd, the council of workers' squad's representatives created a commission for the formation of workers' guards and on April 29 in the Pravda newspaper has appeared a draft of its statute. The Vyborg raion (district) council of Petrograd on April 28 declared to transform the squads of workers' and factory militia into the Red Guard squads. On May 17 the Samara council of workers' representatives (deputies) established a commission in the creation of Red Guard squads. A big role in the creation of the Red Guard squads played the Factory committees. Before April 1917, seventeen Russian cities created Red Guard squads, which by June increased in numbers to 24. Red Guards were the base for the forming of the Red Army. Therefore, the term is often used as just another English name for the Red Army in reference to the times of the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War. In Petrograd, the head of the Red Guards (30,000 personnel) was Konstantin Yurenev. At the time of the October Revolution, the Russian Red Guards had 200,000 personnel. After the revolution, the Red Guards performed some of the functions of the regular army, between the time the new Soviet government began demobilizing the old Russian military and the time the Red Army was created in January 1918. Organization During the revolution, training of the Red Guards was arranged by the Military Organization of the RSDLP. Enlistment was voluntary, but required recommendations from Soviets, Bolshevik party units or other public organizations. The military training of workers was often performed without disengagement from the work at plants. There were both infantry and mounted regiments. At different places, the organization was nonuniform in terms of subordination, headcount, degree of military training. This state was often called \\"half-partisan\\". While successful at local conflicts (e.g., with ataman Alexander Dutov in Orenburg guberniya), this loose organization was inefficient when combating larger, organized forces of the White Army. Therefore, when the creation of the Red Army was decreed, Red Guards had become the Army Reserve and the base for the formation of regular military detachments.

Deutsch left the group in 1884 when he was arrested and sent to Siberia and Sergei Ingerman joined in 1888. The group published the first Russian language translations of many works by Karl Marx and distributed them. It became the major adversary to the Narodniks on the left wing of politics in the Russian Empire. Two drafts (1883 and 1885) of a program for the Russian Social Democrats, written by Plekhanov, were also published by the group, marking an important step to what would become the building of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). At the first congress of the Second International in Paris (1889) onwards, the group represented the RSDLP.

Leake of Castle Leake, County Tipperary. He matriculated from New College, Oxford, on 13 June 1735. Following his studies he went to Rome, where he became friendly with the Neoclassical painter Anton Raphael Mengs who painted his portrait. On his return to Britain he published his Inquiry into the Beauties of Painting (1760). Winkelmann later accused him of having plagiarised the work from the unpublished manuscript of Mengs' treatise Gedanken √ºber die Sch√∂nheit. In later life he lived mainly at Bath. He was married twice, first, to Jane Lloyd and, later to Elizabeth Creed. He died, leaving no children, on 2 August 1798.

Romanticism needed to develop a new theory of knowledge that went beyond the method of inertial science, derived from the study of inert nature (natura naturata), to encompass vital nature (natura naturans). Samuel Taylor Coleridge was at the core of the development of the new approach, both in terms of art and the 'science of knowledge' itself (epistemology). Coleridge's ideas regarding the philosophy of science involved Romantic science in general, but Romantic medicine in particular, as it was essentially a philosophy of the science(s) of life. :What is Life? Were such a question proposed, we should be tempted to answer, what is not Life that really is?  Background  European thought had come through the scientific revolution concerning heaven (astronomy) and earth (physics), and emerged, full of optimism about man's power of cognition, into the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. In facing the mystery of life itself, researchers first sought to apply the method that had worked so effectively for inertial nature to the realm of vital nature. In this approach Man himself was seen as a static entity and a tabula rasa, onto which was written sense- experience, considered as the source of all knowledge. Thus, life and knowledge were increasingly regarded from a mechanical and materialistic perspective. As William Godwin stated succinctly about the age, \\"the human mind‚Ä¶ is nothing but a faculty of perception,\\" that all knowledge \\"comes from impression,\\" and the mind starts with \\"absolute ignorance.\\" (Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, 1793) However, this approach faced a problem: the experience of a split between subject (man as experiencing) and object (the thing being experienced), the inner world of the mind and the outer world of things. This very real experience created a growing unease and doubt in Western philosophy regarding the reliability of sense-experience as the basis for knowledge: did what was perceived bear any true relationship to what was or was perception simply at best a representation of reality and at worst an illusion. The epistemological dilemma arising from man's existential reality eventuated in two positions - materialism and idealism. The materialism of Hobbes elevated matter, and the sense-experience of matter, to the level of sole reality, life being but an epiphenomenon. The contrary position of Hume was that the only reality man could be certain of was his inner experience of thought so that reality was not object-ive (things outside of us), but a creation of the mind. The materialist position was combatted initially by the works of the Cambridge Platonists, notably More and Cudworth, who set out to show how Nature, Man and the Divine were connected through a 'plastic power' that was accessible to the mind if it were approached rightly. :Cudworth had challenged the rising tide of empiricism in his day by asserting that the universe was not (as Hobbes and others believed) composed merely of inert material atoms governed by mechanical laws; rather, the natural world was symbolic of a transcendent reality that lay beyond material appearances. The idealist position was challenged by the Common Sense Philosophy of Thomas Reid. The German philosopher, Immaunuel Kant, whose ancestors came from the same part of Scotland as Reid, set out to rescue scientific knowledge from the idealism of Hume. While his critical analysis set the foundation for a more rigorous philosophy and science, his solution to idealism was to accept Hume's limits to human knowledge as well as the idea of a transcendent reality, but then to assert the legitimacy of natural science in delineating the reality of sense-experience, and to operate 'as if' what one perceived was indeed reality, an approach that served to 'save the appearances'.  Central role of Samuel Taylor Coleridge  Romanticism was inspired by Kant's critical approach to the problem of knowledge, but rejected his limits to that knowledge, seeing it as confining the science of vital nature to the materialist approach, making life an epiphenomenon of \\"the chance whirlings of unproductive particles\\" as Coleridge put it succinctly. There was a profound feeling that a new epistemology, or 'science of knowledge' was needed to deal with the question of vital nature and the nature of life itself. Art, and in particular poetry, provided a vehicle to explore vital nature and to get to its essence, but for it to be scientific required an epistemological foundation. The central figure in the development of this epistemology was Samuel Taylor Coleridge (along with J.W. von Goethe in Germany); this was recognized in his time, after his time and even most recently. : Certainly he stood athwart his age in many respects‚Ä¶and not least his seminal presence in the more ordered oeuvres of his friends and critics‚Ä¶continues to grow. : ...he was so seminal a thinker that his insights and apercus tend to \\"sprout in the brains\\" with a fertility that is positively dangerous. : The influence of Coleridge, like that of Bentham, extends far beyond those who share in the peculiarities of his religious or philosophical creed. He has been the great awakener in this country of the spirit of philosophy, within the bounds of traditional opinions. He has been, almost as truly as Bentham, 'the great questioner of things established'; for a questioner needs not necessarily be an enemy. (John Stuart Mill, in Coleridge, 1840) Coleridge was strongly influenced in his initial study of philosophy by Kant, but also from the re- introduction of Platonic thought via the Cambridge Platonists, particularly the discovery of Cudworth's history of thought [Hill, Introduction], and the ideas of Plotinus and neo-Platonism, not to mention the common sense philosophy of Thomas Reid. The view of the mind as passive was challenged, as it seemed to leave no room for creativity and individuality. His own experience of creative powers of the mind, as experienced in and through poetry in particular, led him to seek out the role of imagination in human thought, and necessarily to distinguish it from fancy.  Role of imagination  The meeting with Wordsworth in 1795 marked a turning point in Coleridge's thinking about thinking. In Wordsworth, Coleridge found a congenial mind, one that helped to foster the \\"innate platonising quality\\" of his mind. This collaboration led to an enhancement of his own poetic creativity and the growth of his critical faculty. : If Coleridge plunged impulsively into the Rubicon in 1795, it is equally clear that he emerged on the further shore in the late summer of 1802 and advanced directly on Rome with confidence and a firmly defined sense of mission. Coleridge went to Germany with Wordsworth in 1798-99, learned German and became more acquainted with German philosophy, both the Kantian stream and German Idealism (Fichte, Schelling). Coleridge came to realize that the mind was not an associative faculty governed by blind, mechanical laws, as Hartley's doctrine of mechanical association presented it, but rather was essentially a product of a creative shaping power (imagination) that ruled perception and governed our mentation but could also in its higher form be used to create new \\"things\\", resulting in the evolution of consciousness and mind itself. Coleridge distinguished between imagination and fancy, which only fabricated illusions. For Coleridge, the creative capacity of the imagination, the \\"prime agent of all human perception,\\" was the key to connecting to the essence of things outside of ourselves and overcoming the apparent split between self and object occasioned by man's self-consciousness. The driving force of that connection and the activation of the creative imagination to get at the inherent essence of external objects was love, a deep desire to know other than ourselves. As Dorothy Emmet (1952) noted, the entire basis of Coleridge's new approach to knowing nature was that \\"we should be able not only to look, but to love as we look\\" making philosophy and science a romantic endeavour.  Relation of matter and sense-experience to reality  For Coleridge, Western philosophy was intellect-bound and driven, containing no power of creative imagination, such as could be discerned in the Greek term nous (\\"noetic capacity\\"), as expressed most maturely in neo-Platonic philosophy (Plotinus). Philosophy, for Coleridge, was scientia scientiarum (the science of science), and critical to any advance in knowledge was its ability to go beyond a mere compilation of facts to the use of the creative imagination to create a true epistemology, or the 'true and original realism.' :The final object and distinctive character of philosophy, is this: for all that exists conditionally (i.e. the existence of which is inconceivable except under the condition of its dependency on some other as its antecedent) to find a ground that is unconditional and absolute, and thereby to reduce the aggregate of human knowledge to a system. Philosophy itself becomes the supplement of the sciences, both as the convergence of all to the common end, namely, wisdom; and as supplying the copula, which modified in each science in the comprehension of its parts to one whole, is in its principles common to all the sciences, as integral parts of one system. And this is METHOD, itself a distinct science, the immediate offspring of philosophy, and the link or mordant by which philosophy becomes scientific and the sciences philosophical. The office of philosophical disquisition consists in just distinction; while it is the privilege of the philosopher to preserve himself constantly aware, that distinction is not division. In order to obtain adequate notions of any truth, we must intellectually separate its distinguishable parts; and this is the technical process of philosophy. But having so done, we must then restore them in our conceptions to the unity, in which they actually co-exist; and this is the result of philosophy. This capacity for seeing in a new light required a new capacity, and just as 'all the organs of sense are framed for a corresponding world of sense' so 'all the organs of spirit are framed for a correspondent world of spirit' so that the first principle of a true philosophy is 'to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual in man' that is, that which lies on the other side of our natural awareness from sense-experience. And it is the sense-world that derives from a higher super-sensible world, not the converse as materialism would have it. \\"I teach a real existence of a spiritual world without a material, but no matter without Spirit.' This world beyond the confines of space and time involved an 'ethereal element' by means of which individual entities, at base non- material, could communicate via 'the tremulous reciprocations of which propagate themselves to the inmost of the soul'. And these tremulations operate on and between entities via one's deep desire (love-resonance) that creates a circuit between subject and object, such that one has access via an inner organ (Coleridge's \\"inmost mind\\" or Goethe's Gem√ºt) and the corresponding 'philosophic' or re-emergent Greek noetic organ. All knowledge for Coleridge rests on the \\"coadunation\\" of subject and object, of the representation in the mind (thought) of a sense experience with the object itself, which can only occur where there is a connection between subject and object ('a reciprocal concurrence of both') beyond pure sense-experience, such that the thought that arises out of 'the mind's self-experience in the act of thinking' produces not a representation but a phenomenon (in the Heideggerian sense) that is the re-enactment in the mind of reality (such as for Collingwood in his Idea of History) and as such is knowledge that is apodictic, heuristic and hermeneutic all at the same time.  Dual basis for the epistemology of life  Coleridge based his epistemology on two facts of experience: that of self (I AM) and that of a world co-connected with self. Our being is something we can know intuitively and certainly, but the existence of things outside is less certain and subject to doubt, unless one acknowledges that a world outside is 'not only coherent but identical, and one and the same thing with our own immediate self-consciousness', that is, that the experience of things without is a function of our experience of self. If we use only the intellect, we separate things that are not in reality separated, and this then gives only a knowledge of the outer appearances (Bacon's natura naturata), termed in German, Wissen, known as natural science (Natur-Wissenschaft). Upon irradiation from the noetic (from Greek nous) ideational capacity, however, this natural science of inert nature then becomes a useful means to render rational and analytical (therefore public knowledge or science) what is otherwise experienced only internally as a private ('subjective') knowledge. The presupposition of material science of an objective world 'out there' separate from us that causes sense-experience and is then responsible for our thoughts and feelings is replaced for Coleridge by 'the truest and most binding realism' that is grounded in a \\"coeducation\\" between subject and object, mediated by the creative imagination, a very real power of mind that reunites in 'the human mind above nature', what is always united, but only separate by a 'prejudice of our mind' due to our self- consciousness arising out of the self-awareness created by the mental capacity (Latin mens). Coleridge's ‚Äútrue and original realism‚Äù accepts that the object perceived is itself real and not an illusion of the mind, as Hume and Kant would have it, but also that 'an object is inconceivable without a subject as its antithesis. Omen perceptum percipientum supponit [Everything perceived supposes a perceiver].' At the same time, the underlying principle of this realism can be neither subject or object, but that which unites the two, and this is a self-consciousness presence of mind ('self-consciousness is not a kind of being, but a kind of knowing' - Biographia Literaria) :Thesis VI: This principle, and so characterised manifests itself in the SUM or I AM; which I shall hereafter indiscriminately express by the words spirit, self, and self- consciousness. In this, and in this alone, object and subject, being and knowing, are identical, each involving and supposing the other. In other words, it is a subject which becomes a subject by the act of constructing itself objectively to itself; but which never is an object except for itself, and only so far as by the very same act it becomes a subject. Sense-experience for Coleridge does not cause mind but is a means of revealing and evolving mind. As a result, being and thinking are not related as cause to effect, but as co-determinant. ‚Äú... the principium essendi does not stand to the principlum cognoscende in the relation of cause to effect, but both the one and the other are co-inherent and identical.‚Äù (Biographia Literaria) Self- conscious, being a self-contained principle, can then be made into a pure thought, containing a polarity, \\"with two opposite and counteracting forces,\\" which is the minimum needed for motion (‚Äúlife‚Äù), that then leads to self- discovery and \\"the fullness of the human intelligence.\\" (Biographia Literaria) :If the intelligent faculty should be rendered more comprehensive, it would require only a different and apportioned organization‚Äìthe body celestial instead of the body terrestrial‚Äìto bring before every human soul the collective experience of its whole past existence. (Biographia Literaria)  Method  The means by which philosophy, or the general principles for seeking knowledge, is rendered into actual knowledge or science is ‚Äúmethod.‚Äù Method involves the considered, thoughtful arrangement of parts that reflects the inner essence of things (association by continuity), and not simply their apparent association in space and time (association by contiguity). This involves a \\"preconception\\" a \\"leading Thought\\" - Bacon's 'forethoughtful inquiry' or 'dry light' (lumens siccum) - and a\\"progressive transition\\" not \\"a mere dead arrangement.\\" :But as, without continuous transition, there can be no Method, so without a preconception there can be no transition with continuity. The term, Method cannot therefore, otherwise than by abuse, be applied to a mere dead arrangement, containing in itself no principle of progression. Coleridge uses the example of electricity which had been known as an empirical fact for centuries, but it was not until science took on the organizing Idea of polarity (out of the genius of mind that derived this from the ‚Äúgiven‚Äù of the world order), that rapid progress was made in revealing the nature and governing laws of this fact of nature. This is in contrast to magnetism, also known for centuries, but still 'unknown' scientifically in his day as being still without an organizing Idea. :The naturalist, who cannot or will not see, that one fact is often worth a thousand (the important consideration so often dwelt upon, so forcibly urged, so powerfully amplified and explained by our great countryman Bacon), as including them all in itself, and that it first makes all the others facts; who has not the head to comprehend, the soul to reverence, a central experiment or observation (what the Greeks would perhaps have called a protophenomenon)‚Äì; will never receive an auspicious answer from the oracle of nature. The fact of a relationship of parts to wholes derives from man's inherent experience of himself as apart from nature and yet somehow connected with it, ‚Äúthe instinct, in which humanity itself is grounded: that by which, in every act of conscious perception, we at once identify our being with that of the world without us, and yet place ourselves in contradistinction to that world.‚Äù :The arrangement of parts must be into a consciously perceived real whole where the whole is in each of the parts (though some parts may contain more of the whole), and is not merely the sum of the parts (mechanism) or even greater or above the parts (mysticism). Arranging the parts into their governing whole involves two forms of ordering or relations: ordination, or the hierarchicial arrangement of discoveries using the 'leading Thought\\" such as in medicine, physics and chemistry, and \\"LAW\\", which is the correlative to the Platonic 'IDEA', In other words, Idea and Law are the Subjective and Objective Poles of the same Magnet i.e. of the same living and energizing Reason [Wisdom]. What is an Idea in the Subject, i.e. in the Mind, is a Law in the Object, i.e. in Nature. (from a letter by Coleridge of 23 June 1829) Both determine the relation of the parts to the whole, and create the governing 'truth originating in the [noetic] mind, and not abstracted or generalized from observation of the parts.\\" There is divine or spiritual LAW and Natural Law, and between these two lies the laws governing human culture or the arts, for every work of the genius of man contains 'a necessary predominance of the Ideas (i.e. of that which originates in the artist himself), and a comparative indifference of the materials'. The goal of philosophy is to make systematic and conscious that which otherwise happens naturally, but unconsciously, namely access to the higher realm of Idea and Law (what Coleridge termed revelation), so as to then unfold through reason the various principles of application. :Deep Thinking is attainable only by a man of deep Feeling, and all Truth is a species of Revelation.\\" The development and progression of mind and consciousness from and to this realm of what the Greeks termed wisdom (philosophy being the systematic means of bringing wisdom from the Superconscious Mind (\\"The vision and the faculty divine\\") and individual sub-consciousness into the conscious mind) is what Coleridge terms ‚ÄúMethod.‚Äù From this Coleridge is led to conclude that there is a functional polarity: the productive power (dynamis), \\"which acts in nature as nature, is essentially one‚Ä¶with‚Ä¶the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature.\\" (BL) Given this ‚Äúself-organising‚Äù power in nature, form then follows function, or form is developed not from without, but from within. While developing and once developed, it can be influenced from without (stimuli), but its formative forces lie within and work outward. The correlative of this is ‚Äúthat as the forms in all organized existence, so must all true and living knowledge proceed from within.‚Äù Knowledge is a proper exercise of mind, not the blind, mechanical collation of data along some presumed criteria for ordering. As Coleridge wrote of Bacon, who he saw as misunderstood and misinterpreted, \\"the truths which have their signatures in nature, and which (as he himself plainly and often asserts) may indeed be revealed to us through and with, but never by the senses, or the faculty of sense.\\" Thus, the role of mind becomes paramount. Where in Nature there are laws to keep everything in harmonious, dynamic whole, powered by a blind force (living principle), there must also be a similar force, but rational in essence, that works on and in man, what the Greeks termed the Logos, and its executive organ, the nous. Coleridge sees two directions for the mind - outward and inward - reflecting the two givens of man's existence - the world ‚Äúout there,‚Äù experienced through the physical senses and the world ‚Äúin here,‚Äù experienced through man's thinking capacity. The \\"Sense\\" (German Sinn) polarically contrasted with \\"the inmost Mind\\" (Goethe's Gem√ºt) - \\"A science which derives its name and character from the Logos.. as distinguished from ... the Sense and from the Nous.\\" (Treatise on Logic II, 38 and 39) and in his Essays on Method, Essay XI, \\"[There are] two forms of method, inseparably co- existent.\\" :If the artist copies the mere nature, the natura naturata, what idle rivalry! If he proceeds only from a given form, which is supposed to answer to the notion of beauty, what an emptiness, what an unreality there always is in his productions, as in Cipriani‚Äôs pictures! Believe me, you must master the essence [Wesen], the natura naturans, which presupposes a bond between [mother]nature in the higher sense and the soul of man [human nature].\\" (On Poesy or Art 1818) There is a method for discovering both: the sensible world of nature out there (though also within us), via a simple desire to explore; and the super-sensible world of man's thought activity within. In essence, as Coleridge says: ‚ÄúThe potential works in us [virtually] even as the actual works on us.‚Äù Coleridge challenged two basic assumptions of inertial science: the absolute dichotomy between mind and matter (or subjective and objective), or the severed ‚Äúoutness‚Äù of nature; and the assumption as fact, that physical nature has acted always and at all times the same (‚Äúuniformitarianism‚Äù) ‚Äì that is the assumption of a fixed ‚Äúoutness‚Äù of perceived objects (natura naturata). The first follows from the second as uniformitarianism presupposes the fixed ‚Äúoutness‚Äù of appearances. However, as Coleridge understood, ‚Äúoutness‚Äù is not tenable philosophically or historically. For Coleridge, scientific method cannot be based on the absolute ‚Äúoutness‚Äù of things, but must involve accepting that an ‚Äòobject as experienced‚Äô is, in plain terms, the object itself; and that there is no other, and somehow still more objective, object lurking coyly behind it (as Kant would have it).  Theory of life  Man, being his own ground and starting point, (the scriptural I AM in that I AM or YHWH) is then confronted with the mystery of life. There is an apparent chain of being from the lowliest form of biological life to the highest. The highest is man himself, the one with the unique capability for self-awareness and self-reflection, thinking about things and even thinking about thinking, the highest form. It is also obvious that there are different kinds as well as degrees, seen in the distinction between minerals and animals, and between these two kingdoms and the plant kingdom. In the latter distinction, there also generally is seen the presence or absence of life. Matter, in the mineral form, is not dead, but what Saumarez termed \\"common matter,\\" whereas plants and animals involve \\"living matter.\\" This is what Coleridge terms ‚Äúlife biological‚Äù as for him, there is life in all of creation, life consisting of a dynamic polarity of forces, that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestation: \\"Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing‚Äîa self- subsistent hypostasis‚Äîbut an act and process..\\". (Biographia Literaria) This dynamic polarity produces motion, acts throughout all of creation, and via the power of the creative imagination, leads to the evolution of mind and consciousness. And the direction of this motion of the universe is towards increasing individuation, though there is also equal and opposite tendency of connection, the interaction of which leads to higher and higher individuation, \\"the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object.\\"(Biographia Literaria) This productive or generative power of life (Blumenbach's Bildungstrieb- Coleridge sat in on his lectures during his visit to Germany) exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but its \\"productive energy is not extinguished in this product, but overflows, or is effluent‚Ä¶as the function of the body.\\" (BL). Thus, the very nature of the ‚Äúgiven‚Äù (IT IS) is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity ('multeity in unity') in Coleridge's sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting or 'gathering' state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form, a new creation or emergent, of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form. :But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (Biographia Literaria) :To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence. Matter, for Coleridge is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power but a resultant. It is also forms the mass of a given body. The entire process of nature is this progressive unfolding of principle into matter, and then the increasing tendency to move inward that which was previously external, that is, to individuate forms. With Coleridge, there is also a four-fold or bi-polarity of powers, forces and energies represented by the cross. Each power has itself two poles. In ancient philosophy this bi-polarity was represented by the four element theory - air, water, fire and earth and more modernly by the four-fold composition of matter - carbon (earth), hydrogen (fire), oxygen (water) and nitrogen (air). This progressive unfolding of the initial dynamic principle into the dimensions of space and time leads to a trinity of 'life biological'. :My hypothesis will, therefore, be thus expressed, that the constituent forces of life in the human living body are‚Äîfirst, the power of length, or REPRODUCTION; second, the power of surface (that is, length and breadth), or IRRITABILITY; third, the power of depth, or SENSIBILITY. With this observation I may conclude these remarks, only reminding the reader that Life itself is neither of these separately, but the copula of all three‚Ä¶ (Here we can also see the interchange between Schelling and Andreas R√∂schlaub in Germany in the context of Romantic medicine). :The study of sensibility gives rise to the issue of mind and consciousness. As a medical colleague lectured in this regard, the ‚Äòultimate end of organic nature is presented in the achievement of that sensibility ... by which the animal exists from itself, in itself, and, though imperfectly, for itself .... Now, this position is the same as to assert that a mind must be added to life, and consequently, that a transition from life to mind . . . must be assumed.‚Äô Coleridge also sees that the instincts - hunger, thirst, mating - motivate growth and evolve into higher powers, the most important being that of desire which 'has something of the quality of the concept of imagination\\". As Bostetter states: ‚ÄúThe fact that he derives all the passions from the third vital power [Desire]‚Äìfundamentally a sexual power‚Äìshows how much aware he is of its importance.‚Äù And in linking it also to the mind elsewhere, shows how thought itself is a ‚Äúsexual‚Äù function (Eureka!). With the study of the passions, the intermediate stage between life and the emergence of mind, Coleridge had in mind a system in which mind was both the passive goal and active agent in ‚Äúlife universal.‚Äù For Bostetter, his was a transcendentalism ‚Äúin which a universal mind or life force created, flowed through, and, by process of evolution, shaped the physical universe.‚Äù  Mind and polarity of powers  The Mind is bipolar in that intellect and reason comprise the 'sense' and nous poeticos and nous patheticos, the dual aspects of the nous itself, \\"the inmost nature\\" of mind. :The flux and reflux of the mind in all its subtlest thoughts and feelings‚Ä¶in its inmost nature - in modes of inmost being - the tremulous reciprocations of which propagate themselves even to the inmost of the soul. (Biographia Literaria) For Coleridge, the mind was an action, a power not a thing, ('the mind's self- experience in the act of thinking') and in this power there are two powers, active and passive, with the imagination functioning in-between. :There are evidently two powers at work, which relatively to each other are active and passive; and this is not possible without an intermediate faculty, which is at once both active and passive. (BL) :Thus, the act of thinking presents two sides for contemplation, ‚Äì that of external causality, in which the train of thought may be considered as the result of outward sensations, of accidental combinations, of fancy, or the associations of memory, ‚Äìand on the other hand, that of internal causality, or of the energy of the will on the mind itself. Thought therefore, might be thus regarded as passive [reactive] or [pro]active. (BL)  Imagination, desideration and polarity  Coleridge goes on to deal with this power of imagination that emerged from the third power of the passions - desideration. The emotions, if contemplated and ‚Äúrecollected in tranquility‚Äù produce objective, as opposed to subjective, feeling that can then be expressed aesthetically via symbols (Suzanne Langer). The 'poetic' imagination is essentially projective, producing projective art works, whilst the philosophic imagination of Coleridge is evocative and is used to draw out the meaning and essence of the symbols already extant in our surroundings. And these objective feelings, being linked to reality and the over-riding super-sensible determinant of that reality, act powerfully within the forms of nature and culture. As was expressed in the Preface to the Lyrical Ballads, \\"the power of the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as might almost appear miraculous‚Ä¶\\" (This would point to the founder of the American New Thought movement, Phineas Parkhurst Quimby) In a famous passage from his Biographia Literaria, Coleridge distinguishes between the primary imagination, which is the underlying agent of human perception, and the secondary imagination, which operates more in the conscious mind, and this is further polarized between its highest effort - new re-creation (unity through re-creation) - and its fallback - a struggle to unify through idealization. :The primary Imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM. [It acts by creating a oneness, even as nature, the greatest of poets, acts upon us when we open our eyes upon an extended prospect. ] The secondary Imagination I consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will, yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency, and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate: or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still at all events it struggles to idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead.(Biographia Literaria) For Coleridge, poetry is idealistic and man needs to go beyond the projective forms of art, the belletristic arts, to another art form, this time where man as subject, draws out of nature, including human nature, the potential that is there in what we actually experience. For Romantic medicine, in particular, Andreas R√∂schlaub and Samuel Hahnemann, the art of remediation, to achieve a true health for the individual, was an evocative art, Heilkunde and Heilkunst, that sought, as in the ancient Greek idea of education, to educe, to elicit or draw out of the suffering individual what was potential (state of health) into actuality.  Imagination and understanding  Imagination is active and acts while ‚Äúhovering between images,‚Äù and when it fixes on a given image, it then becomes understanding. Communication of these images of the understanding is what Coleridge terms 'noetic ideation'. ‚ÄúCommunication by the symbolic use of the Understanding is the function of Queen Imagination on behalf of Noetic Ideation.‚Äù In contrast, fancy is static and idealising, creating nothing real, but it does, as Colerdige notes, provide a ‚Äúdrapery‚Äù for the body of thought. The power of imagination is evident in the relationship of reality between parts and whole, and the ability thereby to associate parts of the same whole (phenomenon) (association by contiguity) that are not ordinarily so associated in time and space (association by continuity), \\"the perception of similitude in dissimilitude\\" which \\"principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds, and their chief feeder.\\" (Wordsworth's Preface to the Lyrical Ballads) Indeed, it is in the ability to see what is similar in what appears dissimilar, and what is dissimilar in what presents as similar (continuity) that resides the creative genius of a man. Art is an artificial arrangement, that is to say, not that of crude nature, but nature re-arranged is ‚Äúre- presented‚Äù to the mind of man so that there is a condensed unity of parts in a given representation (compare Literature with History). It is not an illusion, but a re-creation of nature's innate unity, unconscious and promiscuous, into a new unity. :[Art] is a figurative language of thought, and is distinguished from nature by the unity of all the parts in one thought or idea... Hence nature itself would give us the impression of a work of art, if we could see the thought which is present at once in the whole and in every part; and a work of art will be just in proportion as it adequately conveys the thought, and rich in proportion to the variety of parts which it holds in unity. In re- presenting nature, the ‚Äúpoet‚Äù is not simply copying or distorting nature. But in order to do so, he \\"must master the essence, the natura naturans, which presupposes a bond between nature in the higher sense and the soul of man\\" or human nature. The wisdom of nature, the primal wisdom, is in man in the form of the body; it is participative, unconscious and instantaneous (instinctual). The wisdom of man has to be produced, re-created and given a conscious value or appraisal. It needs to be made coadunative, compresent by an act of will through objective feeling and noetic ideation. In this regard, the body wisdom (Walter Cannon) is striving to become conscious wisdom \\"in the human mind above nature.\\" :...to make the external internal, the internal external, to make nature thought, and thought nature‚Äîthis is the mystery of genius in the fine arts. Dare I add that the genius must act on the feeling, that body is but a striving to become mind‚Äîthat it is mind in its essence? (Biographia Literaria)  Intellect  The intellect is \\"the faculty of suiting measures to circumstances,\\" or \\"the faculty judging according to sense.\\" Intellect is linked initially to fancy, such that their functioning forms a law by which man \\"is impelled to abstract the changes and outward relations of matter and to arrange them under the form of causes and effects.\\" This law is necessary for man's awareness and freedom, but if not conjoined with a new participative capacity (the Goethean Gem√ºt) would \\"prevent or greatly endanger man's development and progression.\\" The intellect in man, as contrasted with animals, is the ability not only to obey rules, but to create them and to know what the term \\"rule\\" means. It is the possibility of sense experience. Sensation is \\"already intelligence in process of constructing itself.\\" Thus, \\"intelligence is a self-development and sensation itself is but vision nascent, not the cause of intelligence, but intelligence itself revealed as an earlier power in the process of self-construction\\" working on the sense-data to provide names of objects and the relationships of their outer forms in terms of cause and effect (what Suzanne Langer terms 'figuration').  Intellect and reason  The intellect also is to be distinguished from reason. The intellect, unirradiated by reason, is a faculty of the instinct, which man shares with the higher animals (cunning). It is subject to the physical laws of heredity, and the evolution from sense to passive understanding is an identical one in man and animal. In man, there is in addition its polar opposite, namely \\"active\\" intellect, which, in the form of conscious intent, is there in man all along as potential in contrast to the animal and forms the basis for criminal law (mens rea). The intellect is reactive as regards the sense pole and proactive as regards the pole of reason (the conceptual faculty). :For the [intellect] is in all respects a medial and mediate faculty, and has therefore two extremities or poles, the sensual, in which form it is St. Paul's œÜœÅŒøŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ± œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ [phronema sarkos - Romans 8., carnal mind] and the intellectual pole, or the hemisphere (as it were) turned towards the reason. Reason essentially deals with principles and the intellect with concepts, both factual (physical) and functional (etheric). The noetic faculty deals with Ideas, which then are elaborated into principles by reason, whilst the intellect establishes concepts arranged using scalar logic (for ordination of facts) and polar logic (for functions). This provides a trinity of mind, wherein the intermediate faculty of imagination is the matrix connecting all of them. Reason is present in the whole process of nature, yet is accessible only to the intellect. It is responsible for the awakening process in human consciousness from unconsciousness, through sleeping and dreaming to waking. Coleridge understood an ascent of consciousness from sense perception, wherein reason lies as potential only (Sleeping Beauty) to the apprehension of reason itself. For Coleridge, intellect is \\"the faculty of rules\\" and reason \\"the source of principles.\\" Intellect is the world of man, and human law, where the end can and often does justify the means. It is not the world of reason. It is the fact of reason's presence in nature that allows us to speak of it becoming apparent or \\"present to\\" the intellect, such that we have an ulterior consciousness that is behind the natural awareness (the \\"unconscious\\") of all animals, one that is self-reflective or \\"philosophic\\" though there is a purely 'mental' philosophy that Coleridge termed 'psilosophy' and that which involves also the noetic capacity of mind (the nous rather than just the mens) which is true philosophy in the Greek sense of 'love of wisdom' ‚Äî philia \\"love\\", sophia \\"wisdom.\\" :Plants are Life dormant; Animals = Somnambulists; the mass of Mankind Day-dreamers; the Philosopher only awake. And this creates a functional identity between the philosophic imagination and instinct, as those who have the first, \\"...feel in their own spirits the same instinct, which impels the chrysallis of the horned fly to leave room in its involucrum for antennae yet to come. They know and feel that the potential works in them, even as the actual works on them.\\" What renders the intellect human (that is, active) is precisely the ability to identify by naming (nominalism), that is, to abstract or generalize, for it is from this ability that we get the human ability of speech. And it is in speech or language that we first see this irradiation of the intellect by reason. Animals may generalize, but they do not name, they do not have the power of abductive inference. Reason makes its mark in the form of the grammar of a language. Thus, the higher understanding is concerned not only with names, but then only with names (denominating) as describing appearances, not content. :...in all instances, it is words, names or, if images, yet images used as words or names, that are the only and exclusive subject of understanding. In no instance do we understand a thing in itself; but only the name to which it is referred. Reason exists in language in the form of grammar (principles of language), though not in idioms which transcend the rational structure). :It is grammar that reflects the forms of the human mind, and gradually familiarises the half-conscious Boy with the fram and constitution of his own Intellect, as the polished Glass does the unconscious infant with the features of his own countenance‚Ä¶bringing about that power of Abstraction, by which as the condition and the means of self- knowledge, the reasoning Intellect of Man is distinguished in kind from the mechanical [intellect] of the Dog, the Elephant, the Bee, the Ant, and whatever other animals display an intelligence that we cannot satisfactorily reduce to mere Instinct‚Ä¶ It is the power to abstract from experience that makes us human, but this power must become a means to an end, not an end in itself, as in material science. That end is imagination and reason, and then, for Coleridge, on to the 'organ' of noetic ideation, the Greek nous.. In instinct we are united with nature, in intellection we are detached from nature, and in imagination re-united with nature. If we make passive understanding (intellection)- the power of abstraction - an end in itself, we become according to Coleridge \\"a race of animals, in whom the presence of reason is manifested solely by the absence of instinct.\\" This means that we become slaves to the idols of our own making (the appearances of things) \\"falling prostrate before lifeless images, the creatures of his own abstraction, [man] is himself sensualized, and becomes a slave to the things of which he was formed to be the conqueror and sovereign.\\" Without reason, we are but animals and commit existential suicide, submitting, as earlier Sophists, \\"all positions alike, however heterogeneous, to the criterion of the mere [intellect].\\" By shutting out reason we end up in a world of opinions, authority-based law, instruction, material science, and the death of spirit and soul. Enlightenment becomes the tyranny of the intellect and good intentions end up on the guillotine of the intellect. Abstraction turned back on itself, becomes dependent on the senses and the outer appearances, or the despotism of the eye and \\"leads to a science of delusion\\" as Coleridge stated. The so-called Enlightenment was more the \\"deliberate shuttering of the [intellect] from the light of reason.\\" Without reason, the intellect becomes active under the impulsion of fancy, such that \\"the omission to notice what not is being noticed will be supposed not to exist\\" or \\"to limit the conceivable within the bounds of the perceivable\\", which is the tyranny or despotism of the physical eye. Reason irradiates the human psyche at all levels as it is, for Coleridge, in seed form even at the lowest level of consciousness. It is the original impetus for self-projection or individuation as Coleridge put it. Reason is a unity not itself divisible, as it can only be used in the singular, unlike intellect and intellects. The intellect operating at the sense pole provides the power that leads to abstraction and man's separation from nature, but also awareness of self as separate from nature and God. However, detachment can lead to existential despair without the 'light of reason' to provide a new attachment or relationship to nature and God, one based on individual sovereignty. With reason, the nisus is from sense to consciousness and finally to self-consciousness, that is, individuation. Until reason is consciously apprehended, we remain in a plant or animal-like state of consciousness, but when apprehended, we are \\"awake\\" (reborn in spirit). The last stage requires the active understanding, which is the intellect fully irradiated by reason, itself irradiated by Nous. :There are evidently two powers at work, which relatively to each other are active and passive; and this is not possible without an intermediate faculty, which is at once both active and passive...In philosophical language, we must denominate this intermediate faculty in all its degrees and determinations, the IMAGINATION, the compleating power which unites clearness with depth, the plenitude of the sense with the comprehensibility of the [intellect], impregnated with which the [intellect] itself becomes [understanding]‚Äì an intuitive and living power. (Biographia Literaria) This then allows for ‚Äúspeculation,‚Äù which is the Baconian realisation of the natural idea out of natura naturata, or the outer appearances of things, guided by the forethoughtful inquiry (lumens siccum) coming from what Coleridge termed the more inmost part of the mind, the noetic capacity or nous. Without such irradiation from both the nous and reason, we end up with ‚Äúlawless flights of speculation‚Äù (Coleridge). Lawful speculation, however, could then be processed by the new Greek or Goethean participative (coadunative, compresent) capacity (Gem√ºt), and worked up into a phenomenological presentation. Reason without the focus on sense experience is ‚Äúpure reason‚Äù (Rudolf Steiner's ‚Äúpure thinking‚Äù or pure sinnen) and in that condition, reason is able to make contact with and be irradiated itself by wisdom. Copernican reason (Aristarchus) allowed us to comprehend the universal verus the Ptolemaic intellect which kept us 'earthbound' in terms of our point of reference. Our individuation culminates in what Coleridge terms \\"the fullness of intelligence.\\" The light of reason is thus both the origin and the abiding basis of individuality. Without the positive presence of reason to the understanding [intellect], there is no individuality, only the detachment which individual being presupposes. Reason, in both its negative and its positive aspect, is the individualiser. Reason itself unirradiated (by the Nous) leads to the dominance of the collective (Hegel's State) over the individual.  Reason and self-consciousness  Reason operating consciously in us through the imagination is the act of self-consciousness, the ‚ÄúI AM.‚Äù Reason, via the intellect also enables initially the mind's detachment from nature, creating 'subject' and 'object.' It provides for the power to behold polarities and indeed shows itself \\"out of the moulds of the understanding only in the disguise of two contradictory conceptions.\\" To avoid being propelled into existential nihilsm, we then need to use the active side of reason ('productive unity'), such that reason is \\"the tendency at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment.\\" To go from the indirect moonlight of mere intellect (mirrored through sense experience) to the direct sunlight of active understanding (irradiated by reason) is to go from exterior perception (of appearances) to a universal ulterior appercetion of phenomena (phenomenology); \\"it is to pass on from fancy's business of arranging and re-arranging the 'products of destruction, the cadavera rerum,' to imagination's business with 'the existence of absolute life,' or Being, which is the 'correlative of truth.'\\" (Biographia Literaria) It is also to go from the delusion that diversity is division or that a concept held by two minds is two concepts, rather than two exemplars of one concept. The power that allows reason to act on the intellect so as to raise it and make it active, as understanding, is the creative or secondary imagination. :... all the products of the mere reflective faculty [moulds of intellect] partook of death, and were as the rattling twigs and sprays in winter, into which a sap was yet to be propelled from some root... (Biographia Literaria) :... the IMAGINATION, the compleating power which unites clearness with depth, the plenitude of the sense with the comprehensibility of the [intellect], impregnated with which the [intellect] itself becomes [understanding]‚Äì an intuitive and living power..(Biographia Literaria) And the apparent contradictions revealed initially by passive reason, are really the dynamic functions of life, and this can only be perceived by the active power of reason, which involves the imagination. :Polarity, being 'incompatible with the mathematical calculus,' is not graspable by the understanding [intellect], but only in the imagination; in fact we have already had occasion to specify it as the basic act of imagination. And reason is also part of the Logos for Coleridge (\\"the Word or Logos is life, and communicates life\\" and it is also \\"light, and communicates light,\\" the light of positive reason, or Nous). The negative form of reason, which is the capability God gave man to comprehend the divine light, is light in its potential form, though the darkness of the mere intellect may fail to comprehend it.  Theory of language  \\"Words are living powers, not merely articulated air.\\" Language is to consciousness what geometry is to space and mathematics to time. It is language, not sense experience, that orients mind to reality. For Coleridge, language in its highest form, is the very tool and vehicle for understanding reality and the basis for the evolution of mind and consciousness. He takes as the foundation our immediate living experience of things (Thomas Reid's Common Sense) as well as of our very self - the mind as dynamic act. Words, for Coleridge, reveal the creative mind, working via the power of imagination (versus the power of fancy) to reveal reality (not to create artifacts of experience). However, there is a difference between the popular, descriptive use of language, which \\"as objects are essentially fixed and dead,\\" and the more serious discursive, scholarly use of language. Beyond that there is the 'best part of language', the language of disclosure, which discloses by the very use of precise, desynonimized terms. This 'disclosive' language emerges as a result of the cultivation of profound (objective) feeling (Suzanne Langer), and deep thought (involving the inmost mind (nous), in both its nether (the nous patheticos, or Goethe's Gem√ºt) and upper aspects (nous poieticos or Rudolf Steiner's Geist). Here, the full mind, both mental and noetic, not just the intellect and reason, is active in establishing the meaning of words. Disclosive language taps into and contains the 'fullness of intelligence', expressing living experience (Erlebniss in German). This disclosive language is also one that evolves along with man's consciousness and the progress of science, in that terms come more and more to be desynonymized, such as the famous distinction Coleridge made between imagination and fancy and awareness and consciousness. Coleridge's view was in contrast to the predominant Lockean tradition: for Locke, static concepts and their verbal exponents arise from experience, whereas for Coleridge the proper use of language is a dynamic or romantic event between mind and nature. :Coleridge's definition of \\"word\\" represents language as participating intimately in the complex relation between mind and world\\" \\"Coleridge presents language as the principal vehicle for the interaction of the knowing mind and known reality. Thus, for Coleridge, language, that is, the different true forms of the one Logos, discloses to us the very content and activity of cognition, and that since 'mind is an act', language is the means for the evolution of mind and consciousness (Logos, the evolver). Initially, Coleridge focussed on poetry as the source of living experience in words, but later came to understand that poetry was 'essentially ideal\\" and that the poetic imagination 'struggles to idealize' and to \\"spread (project) a tone around forms, incidents and situations.\\" One had to go beyond poetry and the poetic imagination, into the 'verbal imagination' to get at the true power of language to use \\"words that convey feelings and flash images\\" to disclose reality via the common ethereal element of our being. This involves a participative capacity of mind to create a dynamic between mind and word, so that the minds of the reader or listener and the writer or speaker create a co-adunation or compresence (Samuel Alexander). This capacity involves not just the abstracting Latin intellect (mens), but the re-emergent participative Greek nous. Coleridge referred to this new capacity of mind, using the nous to irradiate the Latin mens, as an 'ulterior consciousness'. And this capacity of mind to participate mind is an 'ethereal medium.\\" Mind is at the very foundation of being of man and much more than the sum of sense experience, and the purpose of his method is \\"to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual [non-sensible] in man\\" and develop \\"this ulterior consciousness\\". The medium of the compresence of minds (\\"spiritual intercourse\\") is \\"the common ethereal element of their being, the tremulous reciprocations [tremulations] of which propagate themselves even to the inmost of the soul.\\" (BL) Language is both an expression and motive force for the evolution of consciousness; the history of words is a history of mind (see Owen Barfield's History in English Words). For Coleridge, creation is \\"the language of God\\" (Logos), and this can be read in the realms of nature, culture and spirit.  Romantic cognosis  At the core of the idea of romanticism is romantic cognosis, or 'co-gnosis', the dynamic interplay of masculine and feminine forces and energies in the mind and imagination, involving a dyadic unit of consciousness right from the beginning (Genesis: 'male and female made he them'). Coleridge speaks of \\"the feminine mind and imagination,\\" and provides the polaric example of the two giants of English literature, Shakespeare (\\"darts himself forth and passes into all the forms of human character and passion\\") and Milton (\\"attracts all forms and things to himself\\" which \\"shape themselves anew\\" in him). For Coleridge, \\"imagination is both active and passive\\", that is, masculine and feminine in nature. He also provides a similar polarity between the essentially passive primary imagination, that (spontaneously, reactively) configures sensory experience (\\"a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM\\"), and the active secondary imagination that 'dissolves, diffuses and dissipates in order to re-create' via the higher state of mind and consciousness. Coleridge also distinguished between the poetic imagination, which is essentially projective, and the philosophic imagination, which is essentially pro-active (\\"the scared power of self-intuition, [which] can interpret and understand the symbols\\" inherent in the world around us). For Coleridge, the life which is in each of us is in other people and things out there as well, allowing for communication between Mother nature and human nature, as well as between individuals. At the level of mind, ideas are 'mysterious powers, living, seminal, formative' and \\"essentially one with the germinal causes in nature. Goethe's identification and elaboration of the Gem√ºt as the organ of mind for participatiing the living essence or Wesen of nature, whether in Mother or human nature, is what Coleridge termed our 'inmost mind'. In addition to the dynamic polarity between masculine and feminine principles of mind and consciousness, Coleridge identified \\"the pleasure principle\\" as the \\"chief principle\\" and \\"great spring of activity of our minds\\", from which \\"the sexual appetence and all the passions connected with it take their origin.

Rijeka, proljeƒáe 2010. Later in life he converted to the Catholic faith. He believed that for Jews in Croatia the only right way is total assimilation or identification with the Croatian national identity. Singer political activities began during his studies in Zagreb at the end of the 1920s and in early 1930s. He publicly led the University of Zagreb academics organized in the society called \\"Kvaternik\\". Singer with his colleagues, Branimir Jeliƒá, Mladen Lorkoviƒá and Dido Kvaternik, believed that the former political formations were dead and that a new movement which will be in charge of the revolutionary struggle needs to be created. On 6 March 1932 Singer organized a demonstration at the University of Zagreb against the dictatorship of Alexander I of Yugoslavia. In March 1933 he started and edited nationalist paper \\"Na≈°a gruda\\" (Our land). After only two published issues Singer was forced to exile in 1933. He moved to Vienna, Austria. In March 1934 he was arrested by the Austrian police at the request of the Yugoslav authorities in connection with an alleged assassination attempt of Petar Oreb against Alexander I of Yugoslavia. After six months he was released and moved to Italy. In Italy he resided in the Usta≈°a camps. Singer was again arrested after the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, France. He was a commissioner of the supreme organ of Usta≈°a ‚Äì Croatian Revolutionary Movement called Main Usta≈°a Headquarters and was described as a skilled organizer. While in Italy, according to Eugen Dido Kvaternik, only Singer critically looked at Ante Paveliƒá's way of life, but remained loyal. In April 1941, Singer returned to Zagreb with Paveliƒá and other Usta≈°e leaders and was shortly after put in charge of the Special department of the Main Usta≈°a Headquarters. In mid-June 1941, he was put in charge of the Usta≈°e Surveillance Service (UNS) office. On 14 September 1941 members of the communist movement performed a sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb. At the Nazis' request Singer was arrested in connection with this incident and he was imprisoned in Jasenovac concentration camp. While there, he was detained with Vladko Maƒçek. In October 1943, after two year imprisonment, Singer was executed in the Stara Gradi≈°ka concentration camp.

Kiefer Ferenc, Akad√©miai, Budapest, 2003, 273‚Äì279. o.A magyar nyelv k√∂nyve, szerk. A. J√°sz√≥ Anna, Trezor, Budapest, 2004, 664‚Äì679. These are, for the most part, mutually intelligible, and don't differ significantly from standard Hungarian. They are mostly distinguished by pronunciation; although there are differences in vocabulary, these are usually small and don't hinder intelligibility. Due to increased internal migration and urbanization during the 20th century, most of the characteristics of the different dialects can only be observed in smaller towns and villages, and even there mostly among the elderly; the population of the larger cities and especially the capital has been mixed for generations and the dialectal differences have been lost. A notable exception is the Western Transdanubian pronunciation, which is distinctly noticeable even in Szombathely, the largest city in the region. The dialects currently distinguished by researchers: # Western Transdanubian, # Central Transdanubian ‚Äì Little Hungarian Plain, # Southern Transdanubian, # Southern Great Plain, # Pal√≥c, # Tisza‚ÄìK√∂r√∂s, # Northeastern, # Transylvanian Plain (Mez≈ës√©gi), # Sz√©kely, # Moldavian (Cs√°ng√≥). The latter three are spoken outside the current territory of Hungary, in parts of Romania. The Cs√°ng√≥ dialect is spoken primarily in BacƒÉu County in eastern Romania. The Cs√°ng√≥ Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other Hungarian people, and they therefore preserved a dialect closely resembling an earlier form of Hungarian.http://mek.oszk.hu/02700/02789/html/119.html A former classification, distinguished the following dialects: Great Hungarian Plain, West Danube, Danube-Tisza (territories between the two rivers), King's Pass Hungarian (Pass in Apuseni Mountains), Northeast Hungarian, Northwest Hungarian, Sz√©kely, West Hungarian and Cs√°ng√≥. This classification was also used by Ethnologue, with the exception of the Cs√°ng√≥ dialect, which was mentioned but not listed separately. For the seven dialects of Hungarian Sign Language see its article. The dialects ;Western Transdanubian dialect Formerly called West Hungarian. Due to the proximity of Austria its vocabulary is somewhat affected by German; for \\"yes\\", German ja is commonly substituted for standard Hungarian igen. Its pronunciation is characterized by the shortening of long vowels (t√ºz instead of standard t≈±z, buza instead of b√∫za) and the lengthening of consonants (ess≈ë instead of standard es≈ë, sz√∂ll≈ë instead of sz≈ël≈ë). Uses the √´ (closed \\"e\\") vowel profusely. The consonant \\"l\\" is often lost after a long vowel or at the end of words. Consonants are often palatalized (irnyi instead of standard √≠rni), however, \\"ly\\" (originally a palatalized \\"l\\" in the dialect from which standard Hungarian evolved) becomes \\"l\\" instead of the more common \\"j\\". ;Central Transdanubian / Little Hungarian Plain dialect and Southern Transdanubian dialect Formerly called Transdanubian dialect. Central Transdanubian has several subdialects including the Csall√≥k√∂z, the M√°tyusf√∂ld and the Szigetk√∂z dialect. These dialects share some similarities with Western Transdanubian, both in pronunciation and in vocabulary, but the latter was also affected by the Southern Slavic languages, due to their geographical proximity. Ja for igen is common; they distinguish between open and closed e sound, though here it's the open e that differs from standard Hungarian, sounding more like a short a. ;Southern Great Plain dialect or Southern dialect Spoken mostly between the rivers Danube and Tisza, also, in the Banat. This was also the dialect of Budapest and its surroundings. Its vocabulary doesn't show significant differences from standard Hungarian; its dialect words come from Transdanubian, Pal√≥c and Tisza region. This has historical causes: the area suffered the most significant losses during Hungary's Ottoman occupation in the 16th-17th centuries, and was repopulated from different regions of the country. In pronunciation it often uses a vowel which is a cross between \\"e\\" and \\"√∂\\". ;Pal√≥c or Northwestern dialect Spoken in the northwestern part of the Cisdanubian region; mostly in the counties N√≥gr√°d, Heves and the former county Borsod (now the western half of Borsod-Aba√∫j-Zempl√©n), a part of Pest and B√°cs-Kiskun; also spoken in Southern Slovakia. Its vocabulary may use words from Slovak language. Standard a is substituted with a short √°, while standard √° is substituted by a vowel closer to standard √≥. Its best known distinguishing characteristic is the use of diphthongs (au in place of standard o, ie in place of √©). It is one of the few dialects that still pronounce ly, the palatalized version of l which, in other dialects, has already merged into another consonant (in standard and in most dialects into j, in some dialects into l.) ;Tisza-K√∂r√∂s dialect or eastern dialect Formerly called Tisza dialect. It is spoken east of the river Tisza, also by Hungarians living in Romania and Ukraine. It has vocabular similarities with the nearby Transylvanian Plain dialect. Its pronunciation is marked by the use of √≠ instead of the standard √©: n√≠z instead of n√©z, p√≠z instead of p√©nz. East of Debrecen the vowel e is commonly pronounced instead of standard √∂ (ser instead of s√∂r), though not in all words. As common in dialects this side of the Danube, open and closed e is not distinguished. The consonats l, r and j at the end of a syllable often lengthen its vowel. ;Northeastern dialect Spoken in the eastern part of Borsod-Aba√∫j-Zempl√©n County (mostly in the former county Zempl√©n), also in Szabolcs-Szatm√°r-Bereg County and parts of Slovakia. It was the main dialect of the region where important literary figures such as Ferenc Kazinczy (leading figure of the reforming and revitalizing of Hungarian language in the 18th century) and Ferenc K√∂lcsey (also a language reformer, author of the National Anthem) lived and worked; also, of Vizsoly, where the first extant Hungarian Bible translation was published. Due to the dialect forming the basis of standard literary Hungarian, it doesn't have significant differences from it, although it is not identical with it. The small differences are mainly in vocabulary, though in some parts, close to the connecting Tisza-K√∂r√∂s region √≠ is commonly pronounced instead of standard e and there are differences in verb conjugation ‚Äì a distinctive characteristics that was not adopted by standard Hungarian is the different future tense of auxiliary verbs kell (\\"must\\", \\"have to\\") and lehet (\\"may\\", \\"might\\"), with kell lesz and lehet lesz used instead of the standard kell majd and lehet majd. The dialect's characteristics, such as not differentiating between open and closed e, and pronouncing the consonant ly had a lasting effect on the standardized spelling of the Hungarian language. ;Transylvanian Plain dialect Formerly called King's Pass, after a mountain pass in Transylvania. It is spoken in the non-Sz√©kely parts of Transylvania, a region of Romania formerly belonging to Hungary. Its characteristics is the pronunciation of a instead of standard o (bag√°r instead of standard bog√°r), and √° instead of a. In several parts of the region the vowels are shortened (h√°zbol instead of h√°zb√≥l). Interestingly, it retains the preterite tense, the use of which has been steadily declining in other dialects since the Middle Hungarian period; in standard Hungarian its last appearance was in literary texts of the second half of the 19th century, and has been obsolete since then. ;Sz√©kely dialect The dialect most commonly associated with Transylvania has a distinctive and colourful vocabulary; together with the region's rich traditions and folk culture it has given rise to significant literary works. The dialect makes use of several Romanian loan words, which are not always understood by speakers of standard Hungarian. ;Moldavian dialect Formerly and commonly called Cs√°ng√≥ dialect, it is the one that differs the most from standard Hungarian, due to it being the most isolated one. The region where it is spoken is completely separated from the current territory of Hungary. The dialect has two subdialects: the archaic dialect and the Sz√©kely-Cs√°ng√≥ dialect, the former being the only independently developed dialect of Hungarian, and could also be considered a regional language, while the latter was heavily influenced by the neighbouring Sz√©kely dialect. Romanian census lists Cs√°ng√≥ speakers separately from Hungarians. Archaic Cs√°ng√≥ dialect still retains several characteristics of Middle Hungarian, the medieval version of Hungarian, but has a number of Romanian loanwords. Due to its extensive use of archaisms and words specific to the dialect, it is difficult to understand even for Hungarians who also speak Romanian. It has about 10-15,000 speakers, with a further 10-13,000 speakers who use a mixture of Archaic and Sz√©kely- Cs√°ng√≥ dialects. Sz√©kely-Cs√°ng√≥ dialect shows similarities with Sz√©kely subdialects, but it lacks words created during the language reform and has a larger amount of Romanian loanwords. The majority of Cs√°ng√≥s, around 40,000 persons speak this dialect. ;Romungro dialect Romani people in Hungary is a version of the Hungarian language used by Roma people living in Hungary in various stages of assimilation. A large number of Hungarian Roma don't speak their original languages (Lovari or Boyash) any more, but Romungro has a large number of loan words from them. Original Romani words are conjugated in accord with the rules of Hungarian grammar; the Romani effect on Romungro can be observed mostly in the vocabulary. Some words have meanings that in standard Hungarian are expressed by a related word (for example a sly person using other persons for personal gain would be referred to as a snake in standard Hungarian and as a reptile in Romungro). The dialect also has its own proverbs. It has regional differences, which are hard to ascertain, as the dialect is poorly researched, but several typical characteristics are known, such as pronouncing √° instead of standard a, ≈± instead of ≈ë, u instead of o, √≠ instead of √©. Several words or suffixes are shortened, for example the inessive suffix -ban and the illative suffix -ba are merged (in standard Hungarian this is usually a sign of someone being uneducated, which doesn't help the dialect's status in the public opinion). The dialect has a distinctive intonation which easily lends itself to imitation by comedians mocking Roma or lower-class Hungarian people. Despite its low status, several of its Romani loanwords found their way into standard Hungarian, although mostly as slang words. This means that the dialect is completely intelligible for speakers of standard Hungarian.

During Tang Dynasty  Zhang Juhan was born in 858, during the reign of Emperor XuƒÅnzong of Tang, but it is not known where he was born or how he came to become a eunuch. Early in the Xiantong era of Emperor XuƒÅnzong's son and successor Emperor Yizong of Tang (860-874), he was adopted by the eunuch Zhang Congmei (ÂºµÂæûÁé´). (Therefore, it appeared likely that his original name was not Zhang.) Because Zhang Congmei was a eunuch official (director of the office of ladies in waiting), Zhang Juhan was able to, through that heritage, become a eunuch official as well. At one point, he served as the eunuch monitor of the army at Rong District (ÂÆπÁÆ°, headquartered in modern Yulin, Guangxi).History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 72. In 883, during the reign of Emperor Yizong's son and successor Emperor Xizong, Zhang Juhan was recalled from Rong District to serve as an assistant at the Hall of Imperial Scholars (Â≠∏Â£´Èô¢, Xueshiyuan). He was subsequently made an assistant to the directors of palace communications (Ê®ûÂØÜÊâøÊó®, Xumi Chengzhi), as well as the director of office of palace treasury (ÂÖßÂ∫ú‰ª§, Neifu Ling). During the time that Emperor Xizong's brother Emperor Zhaozong was in exile at Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) ‚Äî i.e., from 896 to 898Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 260, 261. ‚Äî he gave Zhang the greater title of Zhong Changshi (‰∏≠Â∏∏‰æç) and sent him to Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), to serve as Lulong's eunuch monitor. Later, when Emperor Zhaozong was set to summon Zhang back to the capital Chang'an, Lulong's military governor (Jiedushi) Liu Rengong submitted a petition that Zhang be kept at Lulong, and Zhang ended up staying at Lulong. In 903, when Emperor Zhaozong, then under control of the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), under the urging of both Zhu and Zhu's ally the chancellor Cui Yin, issued an edict for a general slaughter of eunuchs,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Liu hid Zhang and executed an inmate in his stead, claiming that he had already executed Zhang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. In 906, Zhu launched a major attack on Liu's domain, attacking Yichang Circuit (Áæ©Êòå, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), then governed by Liu's son Liu Shouwen. Liu Rengong sought aid from Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li agreed, but under the provision that Liu send troops to Hedong so that the Hedong and Lulong troops could jointly attack Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), which had fallen under Zhu's control at that time, to try to relieve the pressure on Yichang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Liu sent Zhang and the secretary Ma Yu (È¶¨È¨±) with an army to Hedong, to join the attack on Zhaoyi. After the campaign, however, Li kept Zhang and did not return him to Lulong. After Li captured Zhaoyi and put his adoptive nephew Li Sizhao in command of the circuit, Zhang was made the eunuch monitor of the Zhaoyi army, personally commanding the 3,000 soldiers from Lulong.  During Jin  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang. Li Keyong and several other regional warlords (Li Maozhen, Wang Jian, and Yang Wo) refused to recognize the new regime, and effectively became independent rulers of their own domains ‚Äî in Li Keyong's case, as Prince of Jin. Shortly after, Later Liang launched an army to put Zhaoyi's capital Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û) under siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Zhang Juhan aided Li Sizhao in defending the city, until (after Li Keyong's death early in 908) Li Keyong's son and successor Li Cunxu arrived to defeat the Later Liang army and lift the siege. After that battle, whenever Li Sizhao accompanied Li Cunxu on campaigns away from Zhaoyi, Zhang would be in charge of Zhaoyi in Li Sizhao's absence. It was said that every spring he encouraged the people to be attentive in growing vegetables and trees, and he did what he could to aid the farmers. In 923, Li Cunxu was planning to declare himself emperor of a new Later Tang, and therefore summoned Zhang and the assistant to the military governor of Anyi (ÂÆâÁæ©, i.e., Zhaoyi, changed to Anyi to observe naming taboo for Li Sizhao), Ren Huan, to his presence at Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). This act caused apprehension in the heart of Li Sizhao's son and successor Li Jitao,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. who had taken control of the circuit without the approval of Li Cunxu after Li Sizhao's death in battle.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. As he thought that Li Cunxu summoned Zhang and Ren to prepare to act against him, he thus submitted the circuit to Later Liang's emperor Zhu Zhen.  During Later Tang  Shortly after, Li Cunxu declared himself emperor of Later Tang. He made Zhang, as well as Guo Chongtao, his chiefs of staff (Shumishi), but it was said that Guo had recommended Zhang in order to bypass Li Shaohong, causing Li Shaohong's resentment. Meanwhile, Zhang was said to be careful and not liking to be involved in disputes, so effectively, Guo made all of the important decisions. After Li Cunxu conquered Later Liang later in the year, he gave Zhang a grand general title and put him in charge of the eunuch bureau (ÂÖß‰æçÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng), but continue to have him serve as a chief of staff with Guo. During Li Cunxu's reign, the eunuchs had substantial involvement on policy decisions, but Guo (not a eunuch) continued to oversee the final policy decisions. Zhang continued to not engage himself in those decisions, for the most part. By 926, the Later Tang realm was engulfed in various mutinies against Li Cunxu, partly caused by a famine and partly caused by the army's discontent after Li Cunxu killed Guo and Zhu Youqian on false suspicions of treason. Believing that Wang Zongyan (Wang Jian's son and successor), the emperor of the defunct state of Former Shu, which a Later Tang army under Guo's command had conquered in 925, who was then in the process of being transported to the Later Tang capital Luoyang, would create trouble, Li issued an edict ordering Wang's death, and further stated in the edict, \\"Wang Yan and his entire procession should be executed.\\" Zhang reviewed the edict, and decided by his own to alter the edict to read, \\"Wang Yan and his entire family should be executed,\\" thus saving more than 1,000 Former Shu officials and palace attendants accompanying Wang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Later in the year, Li Cunxu was himself killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself. His adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who had rebelled against him earlier, quickly arrived at Luoyang and took control, initially using the title of regent (although he would later claim imperial title himself). Shortly after Li Siyuan claimed the regent title, Zhang begged him for retirement, and Li Siyuan agreed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Zhang thereafter returned to Chang'an, and Li Siyuan gave his adoptive son Zhang Yangui (ÂºµÂª∂Ë≤¥) an official position at Chang'an in order to have Zhang Yangui be able to attend to him. He died of illness in 928.  Notes and references  * History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 72. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 38. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 264, 272, 274, 275.

Blackburn was also an editor of the Englishwoman's Review. Life Blackburn was born in Knightstown, co. Kerry, Ireland, the daughter of Bewicke Blackburn, a civil engineer, of co. Kerry and Isabella Lamb of co. Durham. When her family moved to London in 1859, she soon came into contact with the women of the Langham Place Group, especially Jessie Boucherett and Emily Faithfull. Over the years Blackburn and Boucherett worked together in a number of endeavours. Both were editors of the Englishwoman's Review (Blackburn, editor, 1880‚Äì90; joint editor, 1890‚Äì95). Together they established the Women's Employment Defence League in 1891, to defend women's working rights against restrictive employment legislation. They also together edited The Condition of Working Women and the Factory Acts, 1896. Blackburn joined the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872 and was secretary of the executive committee of the society from 1874 to 1880. She subsequently held similar positions in a number of related organisations. She also took opportunities to study, first in 1875, taking a class in Roman Law at University College London, and later (1886‚Äì88) classes at University College, Bristol. In the early 1890s, she assisted Charlotte Carmichael Stopes in her writing of British Freewomen: Their Historical Privilege by supplying her own notes on the subject, then by purchasing the whole of the first edition in 1894. She retired in 1895 to care for her aged father, though later returned to take up her work. Portrait of Caroline Ashurst Biggs by Elizabeth Sarah Guinness associated with the bookcases now at Girton College Blackburn inspired and funded two collections. The first was an art collection in 1885 that included pictures and work done by professional women to show the result of women's industry. She was insistent that this would not include voluntary or amateurish work but it work show the products of female professionals. This loan exhibition included portraits of leading women like Florence Nightingale and Mary Carpenter. This was donated to Bristol University, but recent enquiries indicate that this work is now lost. Her second collection was focussed on a book collection by women. The books were from her collection, friends and from second hand sources. Bookplates were commissioned and two bookcases. The bookcases were decorated with paintings of Lydia Becker and Caroline Ashurst Biggs who had been the previous chairs of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women‚Äôs Suffrage. These bookcases were given to Girton College and are extant. In 1880 Blackburn was secretary of the West of England Suffrage Society in Bristol and was the main organizer of a large demonstration. Her long term connection with the women's movement allowed her to write her history of the Victorian women's suffrage campaign, Women's suffrage: a record of the women's suffrage movement in the British Isles, with biographical sketches of Miss Becker, finished in 1902, shortly before her death the following year, at Greycoat Gardens, Westminster, on 11 January 1903, aged 60, and was buried at Brompton cemetery. She left her archives, and the decorated book collection, to Girton College, Cambridge. Her will also made provisions for establishing a loan fund for training young women. In 1903 collaboration with Nora Vynne created the book Women under the Factory Act. In the book they criticised legislators for treating women as if they had not the intelligence of animals i.e. as if they always needed to be cared for to protect them. She and Vynne argued that women should be allowed to take risks with their health in the workplace or they may find themselves always in need to protection as if they were incapable. The book was noted for its accuracy, but the Economic Journal recognised its authors as Freedom of Labour Defence members and suspected that it may have political motives arguing for the \\"equality of men and women\\".

It can be proven mathematically that stellar aberration is due to the change of the astronomer's inertial frame of reference. The formula is derived with the use of Lorentz transformation of the star's coordinates. As the astronomer John Herschel has already explained in 1844, the stellar aberration does not depend on the relative velocity of the star towards Earth. Otherwise eclipsing binary stars would appear to be separated, in stark contrast to observation: both stars are rotating with high speed ‚Äîand ever changing and different velocity vectors‚Äî around each other, but they appear as one spot all the time. Stellar aberration is only due to the change of the astronomer's inertial frame of reference In the year 1926 the astrophysicist Robert Emden published the article Aberration und Relativit√§tstheorie in the journal Naturwissenschaften. (14. Jahrgang, Heft 16) In this article he states that the direction of a light ray isn't influenced by the motion of the star or by the motion of Earth.R. Emden's (rhetorical) question \\"How will the direction of the light rays of stars incident upon Earth be influenced by the motion of Earth and the motion (not the location) of the star at the time of emission?\\" is answered by him with \\"Not at all.\\" At that time, the opponents of the special theory of relativity reasoned that the theory must be flawed, because it would state that the stellar aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star ‚Äî which would be in contradiction to observation ‚Äî and R. Emden's article explains that the special theory of relativity does not predict this. Today, the special theory of relativity isn't contested anymore but there are still articles that suggest that the aberration would depend on the relative velocity of the star.See for example equation (4) in Although a (relativistic) velocity-addition formula can be used to explain stellar aberration, (see Aberration of light), another (relativistic) explanation using only the Lorentz transformation is also possible, as will be demonstrated. This derivation only uses the star's coordinates at the time of emission, and therefore has the formal advantage there is no place for the relative velocity of the star towards the astronomer and therefore it is evident that the observed position doesn't depend on the star's velocity ‚Äî provided that the resultant change of position is much smaller than the distance between star and Earth.I.e. the stars can rotate very fast like eclipsing binary stars as long as the change in position is much smaller than the star-earth distance. The observed position of the star wouldn't depend on Earth's motion either, if the astronomer could use the same inertial frame of reference all the time. But of course that is technically impossible,It's easy to (technically) compensate the deviation of the direction of the axes due to Earth's rotation and earth's orbit but it almost impossible to (technically) compensate a velocity in the order of several 1000 m/s. This can only be achieved with help of mathematics. the astronomer uses his current rest frame and these current rest frames are different at different times as Earth orbits around the Sun. It is mathematically convenient to declare the position of the source star in the rest frame of the Sun (more exactly: the center of mass of the Solar System) as the \\"real\\" position and that the difference to this \\"real\\" position derives form the \\"aberration\\".Of course every inertial frame of reference is physically equal, but the rest system of the barycenter has the mathematical advantage, that it's the mean frame of reference and since the time of Galileo Galilei it's the preferred frame of reference Sample calculation path of light signal in reference frame S path of light signal in reference frame S' S and S' are (quasi-)inertial frames of reference and the reference frame S' is in uniform motion with vx = 0.5c relative to S, such that in the future the star comes nearer to the origin of the coordinate system (and consequently further afar in the past). The x-,y- and z-axes of both systems ought to be parallel and at time t=t'=0 the origins of both systems ought to coincide. Therefore, one gets according to Lorentz transformation: \\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta=v/c , \\\\scriptstyle \\\\gamma=1/\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^{2}}: y'=y ; z=z'; \\\\scriptstyle x'=\\\\gamma\\\\cdot(x-\\\\beta\\\\cdot ct) Suppose now that the star emitted a light signal at time \\\\scriptstyle c\\\\,t_1=-5\\\\,Ly at location \\\\scriptstyle x_1=4\\\\,Ly\\\\;,\\\\;y_1= 3\\\\,Ly\\\\;,\\\\;z_1=0 (S coordinates) and that this light signal is received by an astronomer at time \\\\scriptstyle c\\\\,t_2=0 at location \\\\scriptstyle x_2=0\\\\;,\\\\;y_2=0\\\\;,\\\\;z_2=0. In S the star's position and the x-axis form an angle \\\\delta with \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tan \\\\delta =3/4 \\\\; \\\\rightarrow \\\\;\\\\delta =36.87^\\\\circ But in S' \\\\scriptstyle x_1'=\\\\gamma \\\\cdot (x_1-\\\\beta \\\\cdot c\\\\,t_1)=1,1547\\\\cdot (4 Lj - 0,5\\\\cdot(-5 Lj))=7,50555 Lj; \\\\quad y_1'=y_1=3 Lj and therefore the angle \\\\delta' between the star's position and x'-axisThe lines of x-axis and x'-axis lie on top of each other is \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tan \\\\delta'=y_1'/x_1'=3/7,50555\\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\;\\\\delta' = 21,79^\\\\circ Calculation with help of the formula in aberration of light#Explanation gives the same result: \\\\scriptstyle \\\\tan (\\\\delta'/2) = \\\\tan (\\\\delta /2) \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt {(1-0,5)/(1+0,5)} = \\\\tan (36,87^\\\\circ/2) \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{1/3} = 0,19245\\\\; \\\\scriptstyle\\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\;\\\\delta'/2= 10,89^\\\\circ\\\\;\\\\rightarrow\\\\;\\\\delta'=21,79^\\\\circ. Two-dimensional problem Derivation of the formula for motion along the x-axis For the derivation it is assumed, that the light signal only travels through space regions where the gravitation field is negligible. Hence is suffices to use special relativity and the path of the light signal is a straight line in any inertial frame of reference. Observation in the rest frame S of the center of mass of our Solar System The rest frame of the center of mass (barycenter) is a very goodAn even better quasi-inertial frame of reference would be a frame of reference in which the center of mass of the Milky Way would rest or be in uniform motion. quasi-inertial frame of reference for periods of time in the order of thousands of years, since our solar system needs about 230 million years (galactic year) to move completely around the center of the Milky Way. The space coordinates of this frame of reference form a Cartesian coordinate system. In the reference frame S (x_1y_10c\\\\,t_1) with c\\\\,t_1<0 and (x_1y_1) e (00) are the (space-time) coordinates at which the star emits a light signal and (0000) are the coordinates at which the astronomer receives the light signal. In reference frame S the light signal starts at t_1<0 and stops at time t_2=0 and therefore the light signal did cover the distance d = c\\\\cdot(0-t_1) = -c\\\\,t_1 . In S the path of the light signal is a straight line and it forms an angle \\\\delta with the x-axis with: \\\\sin \\\\delta = \\\\frac{y_1}{d}=\\\\frac{y_1}{-c\\\\,t_1} and \\\\cos\\\\delta=\\\\frac{x_1}{-c\\\\,t_1} Observation in the inertial frame of reference S' which is in uniform motion (relative to S) along the x-axis The origin of the reference frame S' is in uniform motion relative to S with (v00), i.e. moves along the x-axis, and the x-,y- und z-axes of S' and S are parallel to each other and at time \\\\scriptstyle t=t'=0 the origins of S and S' coincide. Let \\\\beta = \\\\frac{v}{c} , \\\\gamma = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta^2}} S' now is an equally good quasi-inertial frame of reference as S: the space coordinates form a Cartesian coordinate system and the path of the light signal is a straight line. According to the Lorentz transformation one gets: x_1' = \\\\gamma \\\\cdot(x_1-\\\\beta \\\\cdot c\\\\,t_1) , y_1'=y_1 , z_1'=0 , c\\\\,t_1' = \\\\gamma \\\\cdot (c\\\\,t_1-\\\\beta \\\\cdot x_1) In reference frame S' the light signal starts at t_1'<0 and stops at time t_2'=0 and therefore the light signal did cover the distance d\\\\,' = c\\\\cdot(0-t_1') = -c\\\\,t_1' . In S' the path of the light signal is a straight line, too. It forms an angle \\\\delta' with the x'-axis and one gets: \\\\sin \\\\delta' = \\\\frac{y_1'}{d\\\\,'}=\\\\frac{y_1}{-c\\\\,t_1'} =\\\\frac{y_1}{-\\\\gamma \\\\cdot (c\\\\,t_1-\\\\beta \\\\cdot x_1)} =\\\\frac{y_1}{-c\\\\,t_1 \\\\cdot \\\\gamma\\\\cdot \\\\left(1-\\\\beta\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x_1}{c\\\\,t_1}\\\\right)}=\\\\frac{\\\\frac{y_1}{-c\\\\,t_1}}{\\\\gamma\\\\cdot\\\\left(1+\\\\beta\\\\cdot\\\\frac{x_1}{-c\\\\,t_1}\\\\right)} =\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\delta}{\\\\gamma\\\\cdot(1+\\\\beta\\\\cdot\\\\cos\\\\delta)} \\\\cos\\\\delta'=\\\\frac{x_1'}{-c\\\\,t_1'} =\\\\frac{\\\\gamma \\\\cdot(x_1-\\\\beta \\\\cdot c\\\\,t_1)}{-\\\\gamma \\\\cdot (c\\\\,t_1-\\\\beta \\\\cdot x_1)} =\\\\frac{-c\\\\,t_1 \\\\cdot \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\left ( \\\\frac{x_1}{-c\\\\,t_1}+\\\\beta \\\\right)}{-c\\\\,t_1 \\\\cdot \\\\gamma \\\\cdot \\\\left( 1 + \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x_1}{-c\\\\, t_1} \\\\right) } =\\\\frac{\\\\frac{x_1}{-c\\\\,t_1}+\\\\beta}{1 + \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\frac{x_1}{-c\\\\, t_1}} =\\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\delta +\\\\beta}{1 + \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\delta} Hence: \\\\tan \\\\delta' = \\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\delta'}{\\\\cos \\\\delta'}=\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\delta}{\\\\gamma\\\\cdot(\\\\cos \\\\delta +\\\\beta)} These are the same formulas as in aberration of light#Explanation.

Formula for motion along the y-axis Let \\\\theta be the angle between the light ray (=path of the light signal which is a straight line) and the y-axis whereby Œ∏ is positive if the y-axis would have to rotate counter-clockwise to coincide with the light ray. Then the derivation of the formula of angle Œ∏' for the motion along the y-axis is the same as the derivation of the formula of angle Œ¥' for the motion along the x-axis.

The astronomer orbits (with Earth) around the Sun and furthermore rotates around the axis of Earth. His current rest frame S' therefore has different velocities relative to the rest frame S of the barycenter of the Solar System at different times. Hence the astronomer observes that the position of the star changes. The formula is derived under the condition that the change of the position of the star and of Earth is negligible in the period of observation.For the star this period lies in the past. That is correct for almost all stars: the amplitude of the parallax of a star, for a distance of ‚â• n parsec, is ‚â§ 1/n\\". Stellar aberration due to the orbit of Earth (around the Sun) The mean orbital speed of Earth is v_e = \\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot \\\\pi \\\\cdot 1\\\\,AE}{365,25\\\\,d} = 29,78\\\\,km/s , and therefore \\\\frac{v_e}{c} = 0,00009935. -> \\\\frac{v}{c} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{180^\\\\circ}{\\\\pi} = 20,5^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}. k_A= 20,5^{\\\\prime\\\\prime} is dubbed constant of aberration for the annual aberration.see e.g. The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax Stellar aberration due to Earth's rotation An astronomer at the latitude \\\\varphi rotates in 24 hours around the axis of Earth. His speed of rotation is therefore v_r= \\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\cdot 40000\\\\,km}{1\\\\,d} = \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\cdot 463\\\\,m/s. Hence \\\\frac{v_r}{c} = \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\cdot 1,54\\\\cdot10^{-6}. Form this so-called diurnal aberration one gets an additional contribution of (at max.) \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\cdot 0,32^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}. Stellar aberration due to the orbit of our solar system around the center of the Milky Way The rest frame of the center of mass of our solar system isn't a perfect inertial frame of reference since our solar system orbits around the center of the Milky Way. An estimation for the time of period of circulation is 230 million years (estimations vary between 225 and 250 million years).see hypertextbook.comNASA - StarChild Question of the Month for February 2000 As the estimation for the distance between our solar system and the center of the Milky Way is about 28000 Ly, the assumed orbital speed of our solar system is \\\\scriptstyle v = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi \\\\cdot 280000 \\\\cdot 9,461\\\\cdot10^{15}\\\\,m}{230\\\\cdot 10^{6} \\\\cdot 365,25 \\\\cdot 24 \\\\cdot 3600} \\\\approx\\\\, 230\\\\,km/s. This would cause an aberration ellipse with a major semiaxis of 2,6' (arcminutes). Therefore, in one year the aberration angle could change (at max.) \\\\scriptstyle 2,6^\\\\prime \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2 \\\\pi \\\\cdot 1\\\\,a}{230000000\\\\,a} = 4,3 ¬µas (microarcseconds). This very small value isn't detectable now, perhaps it's possible with the planned mission of the Gaia spacecraft.This is a hint from H.-H. Voigt: Abriss der Astronomie, 6. Auflage.

Princi was an attorney who served as Collector of Customs for the Port of Boston and as a United States magistrate judge. Early life Princi was born on November 7, 1915, to Joseph M. and Teresa M. Princi, immigrants from Reggio Calabria, Italy. His father worked as a tailor on Newbury Street in Boston. Princi had three brothers, one of whom was actor Carl Princi. Princi graduated from Northeastern University School of Law in 1938 and began practicing law in 1940. During World War II he was a first lieutenant in the Army Intelligence Corps in Italy, Sicily and North Africa. From 1949 to 1959 he was a member of the board of directors and secretary of the Lincoln Settlement House in Boston's South End. Political involvement Princi was an active member of the Democratic Party. He was a delegate to the state Democratic convention in 1954 and an alternate delegate to the 1956 and 1960 Democratic National Conventions. He was close to President John F. Kennedy. Princi also served on a number of boards in his hometown of Winthrop, Massachusetts. He was a member of the Finance Committee, chairman of the board of selectmen, and Town Counsel. In 1960 he was president of the City Solicitors and Town Counsel Association of Massachusetts. Legal career From 1961 to 1971, Princi was a senior partner of the Boston law firm of Princi and Lecomte. In 1964 he also served as assistant district attorney for Suffolk County. Collector of Customs On September 13, 1961, Princi was appointed Collector of Customs for the Port of Boston by President John F. Kennedy. He received his commission from President Kennedy on September 29 in a ceremony held at Hammersmith Farm, the home of Kennedy's mother-in-law. He was sworn into office the following day by Walter A. Van Dalla, chairman of the Winthrop Board of Selectmen, at Winthrop Town Hall. While serving as Customs Collector, Princi worked 60 to 70 hours a week and continued to work at his law practice. During his tenure Logan International Airport became a port of entry for foreign airfreight. Princi resigned in 1962 and was succeeded by state Democratic party chairman John M. Lynch. Northeastern University Princi was president of the Northeastern University Alumni Association from 1963 to 1964. In 1971 he was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University. From 1975 to 1984 he was a member of the Member of the Northeastern University Corporation. United States magistrate In February 1971 Princi was sworn in as a United States magistrate judge by Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr., chief judge of the District of Massachusetts. Princi was a member of the first group of magistrates for the Massachusetts District. Princi's most famous case was the bail and legal preliminaries involved in the Daniel Ellsberg case. Princi recommended that Ellsberg be removed to California to face the indictment charging him with possession of the Pentagon Papers. He also presided over Susan Edith Saxe's appearance in federal court under a federal warrant, the arraignment of former state senator James A. Kelly, Jr., and set bail for the local PATCO president for his part in the 1981 air traffic controller strike. Princi retired as a magistrate in 1981. After leaving the bench, he worked at his son's law firm. Personal life and death Princi was married to Dorothy (Vitagliano) Princi from 1940 until her death in 1975. They had five children. Princi died in his sleep on August 10, 1984, at the home of one of his daughters in Centerville, Massachusetts. He had resided there for ten years prior to his death.

It is preceded by Adian no Tsue (1986), and followed by Chitei Tairiku Orudora (1987). In the game, Allan Colada journeys from his home in the foothills into the mountains to retrieve a remedy for his sister Leela's fever. Gameplay To progress through most game screens, the player must push, kick, or pull logs to clear a path to the exit, as well as to solve arithmetic equations and inequality statements involving fractions. The mechanics of the log-pushing puzzles are comparable to those in the Eggerland video game franchise, which in turn derive from Sokoban (1982). However, by using a rope (which are in limited supply), Allan can also pull a log away. Kicking a log toward an enemy defeats the enemy. The design of the game world is patterned on Nintendo's action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda (1986).

It is located south of the village of Anth√©e. The chateau was built near the intersection of the main road from Namur to Luxembourg and the road from Dinant to Li√®ge. The chateau lies to the south of the village of Anth√©e in a valley surrounded by woods. The chateau replaced a medieval castle, of which there are remains in the north east corner. It was the seat of the lordship of Fontaine, which included Anth√©e, Morville and Miavoye, spanning the counties of Namur and Agimont in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The chateau is built of limestone, and is U-shaped, open to the south, with towers on each corner. There is a farm to the east with the same plan, with the open side facing the chateau. The two-story chateau was probably built in stages in the 16th century. The other buildings were erected in the 16th and 17th centuries. The chateau was renovated in neo-traditional style between 1907 and 1909. The chateau was given a uniform appearance, with the towers raised and the present windows and other decorations added.

Genealogy and birth Nuadu‚Äôs genealogy does not seem to have survived. Archbishop Ware incorrectly states he was the son of Segene but this is a misreading of John Colgan (Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae, 19 February, p. 373), who was referring to a Nuadhat, son of Seigen who was killed in Offaly in 843. Nuadu was from the parish of Estersnow, barony of Boyle, County Roscommon. Two adjoining townlands in the parish are associated with him. Firstly the townland of Estersnow which is a corruption of the Gaelic, Ath- Disert-Nuadhain, meaning The Ford of Nuadu‚Äôs Hermitage, where he lived as an anchorite. John O‚ÄôDonovan in a note under the year 1330 in the Annals of the Four Masters states- ‚ÄòHis holy well, called Tobar Nuadhain, is still in existence, but at present very seldom resorted to by pilgrims. There is a tradition in the country there was a town here, but no trace of it now remains.‚Äò The following extract from an Inquisition taken in the reign of Elizabeth seems to corroborate this tradition: ‚ÄòQuod est quoddam forum sive mercatum in die Sabbatis qualibet septimana quondo non est guerra in patria, juxta templum Sancti Wogani vulgarite Temple-Issetnowne in baronia de Moy Lurg.‚Äò In another part of this Inquisition it is anglicised as Issertnowne. It is also called Tirs Nuadhain locally. O‚ÄôDonovan also writes in his O.S. Letters of 1835- \\"The original site of the church is still occupied by the Protestant one, and there is a holy well not far from it called Tobar Nuadhain, which is said to have been blessed by a monastic old gentleman of the name of Noone (a surname numerous in this country of Moylurg) but at what period no one remembers. This well is fast losing its sanctity and is now but seldom resorted to for cure. When it was in vogue it was visited by great numbers, and when the patient was not to recover from his malady, when he came to drink of its water, the blessed trouts of the well turned their bellies up, and seemed to be sickish and languid, but when he was to recover through the blessed waters of the well, they looked healthy and swam about briskly\\". The cave beside the well was where Nuadu lived as an anchorite and is marked as \\"Issertnowe\\" on the Ordnance Survey maps of the townland. The second townland is Cavetown, which is an Anglicisation of the Gaelic Loch Uama, meaning The Lake of the Cave. It is also called Ballynahoovagh. John O‚ÄôDonovan under the year 1487 in the Annals of the Four Masters states- \\"Baile-na-huamha, i.e. the town of the cave. This place is now called Baile na h-√ömhach in Irish, and Cavetown in English. It is situated between the lakes of Clogher and Cavetown.\\" The Juvencus Manuscript The Juvencus manuscript in Cambridge University was mainly written in the 9th century by a scribe named Nuadu. He signs off at the end with a request in old Welsh- \\"araut di nuadu\\" (A prayer for Nuadu). 19th century scholars assumed this was Bishop Nuadu of Armagh but modern scholarship tends to ascribe it to an Irish scribe working in Wales in the second half of the 9th century, which would be 50 years after bishop Nuadu‚Äôs death. However, the matter is still in debate. Bishop of Armagh On the death of Torbach mac Gorm√°in, the bishop of Armagh, on 16 July 809, Nuadu was appointed as the 32nd bishop in succession to Saint Patrick. Nuadu reigned as bishop for 3 years. Visitation of Connacht In 811 Nuadu made an official visit to the province of Connacht, two years after his appointment as bishop, in order to prohibit certain abuses in the Connacht Church. He carried a relic of St. Patrick with him, an armarium, which was a chest for keeping vestments in a church sacristy. The annals give the following accounts of his visit- Annals of the Four Masters 810- \\"Nuadha, Abbot of Ard-Macha, went to Connaught\\" Annals of Ulster 811- \\"Nuadu, abbot of ArdMacha, went to Connacht with Patrick's law and his casket\\" Chronicon Scotorum 811- \\"Nuadu, abbot of ArdMacha, went to Connacht with Patrick's law and his c√°in.\\" The Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii gives the following reasons for Nuadu‚Äôs visit to Connacht- \\"Then they reared the son in the territory of Enda Artech, that is to say, bishop Domnall in Ailech Mor, which the community of Clonmacnois took away, bishop Coimid in Cluain Senmail, bishop Do-Bonnein Cluainna Manach .... their pupil on All Saints day .... veneration for his fosterer (S. Patrick) when he would come, a cow from each man to him. That servitude clave to the churches until Nuada abbot of Armagh released them. Cormac Snithene was the son‚Äôs name. Snithene‚Äôs field is before Dermag Cule Coennai. Tir Onma Snitheni (the land of Snithene‚Äôs tree) it is named. It is a regret to Patrick‚Äôs community that it was not given to them.‚Äù The Tripartite Life of Patrick, Whitley Stokes (ed.), London 1887, Part I, p. 83. \\"Then Patrick went into the district of Mag Luirg, and his horses were forcibly taken by the tribe of the Sons of Ere, and he cursed the people of that country. But bishop Maine of the Hui-Ailella besought Patrick to forgive his brethren, and Patrick weakened the malediction. And Maine washed Patrick‚Äôs feet with his hair and with his tears, and he drove the horses into a meadow and cleansed their hoofs in honour of Patrick. And Patrick said;-'There will be weeping and wailing and lamenting with the people of that country, and there will not be neighbourhood there in saeculum'; as is fulfilled, And Patrick said that he would have a great part of that country afterwards, as hath been fulfilled in Nodain of Loch Uama. Bishop Maine, moreover, is of Patrick‚Äôs household, and Geintene in the Echanach in Hui-Ailella.\\" The Tripartite Life of Patrick, Whitley Stokes (ed.), London 1887, Part I, p. 145. Death Nuadu died on 19 February 812. The Annals of Ireland give the following obits- Annals of the Four Masters 811- ‚ÄúNuadha of Loch-Uamha bishop, anchorite, and abbot of Ard-Macha, died\\" Annals of Ulster 812- \\"Nuadu of Loch Uama, bishop, anchorite and abbot of ArdMacha, fell asleep\\" Chronicon Scotorum 812- \\"Nuadu of Loch Uama, bishop and abbot of ArdMacha, rested\\" Annals from the Book of Leinster- \\"Nuado, abbot of Armagh, rested\\" Feast Day After his death Nuadu was venerated as a saint and his feast was celebrated on 19 February, the day of his death.

Putna (Hana Rysov√°).JPG Prof. Mgr. Martin C. Putna, Dr., (born 30 May 1968 in P√≠sek) is a Czech literary historian, university teacher, publicist and essayist. He works at the Faculty of Humanities, Charles University in Prague.  Biography and career  Putna was born in P√≠sek, Czech Republic. Between 1986 and 1991 he studied Philology at the Charles University in Prague. Since 1992 he has worked at the Charles University. He also studied Theology at the University of South Bohemia in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. He was visiting scholar at the University of Regensburg. He worked as a director of Vaclav Havel Presidential Library during the years 2009-2011. He is a regular contributor to the daily paper Lidov√© noviny, replacing Ludv√≠k Vacul√≠k as a core column author after Vacul√≠k¬¥s death in 2015.  Academic research  In his work, Putna focuses on Czech Catholic literature and Catholic influences on Czech culture. According to Putna¬¥s definition ‚ÄúCatholic Literature‚Äù (or ‚ÄúCatholic Culture‚Äù) was being born during the 19th century (in different countries at different time periods) as a consequence of the process of secularisation, as ‚Äúcommunity-building literature‚Äù. The Catholic literature served as the vehiculum of self-expression and self- identification of the ‚ÄúCatholic milieu‚Äù. Putna¬¥s work brings first comprehensive historical description of the history of Czech Catholic Literature from 1848 till 1989.http://torst.cz/czech/detail.php?pk=716 In connection with the research Putna prepared several commented editions of previously unknown literary sources (most importantly: Karel VI. Schwarzenberg: Torzo d√≠la. Vybral, sestavil a √∫vodn√≠ studi√≠ a pozn√°mkami opat≈ôil Martin C. Putna. Torst, Praha 2007, 1216 stran).http://torst.cz/czech/detail.php?pk=494 Since 2014, Putna is the editor-in chief of the first complete edition of collected works of Jakub Deml, one of the most complex Czech Catholic writers. Putna also researches other than Catholic streams of Czech spirituality. In the biography ‚ÄûV√°clav Havel. A Spiritual Portrait in the Contet of Twentieth-Century Czech Culture‚Äúhttp://www.iliteratura.cz/clanek/28667/putna-martin-c-vaclav-havel- duchovni-portret-v-ramu-ceske-kultury-20-stoleti (2011) he explored the influences of V√°clav Havel¬¥ family tradition (Masarykian civic and ethic religion, esoteric philosophy) and of post-modern Catholic philosophers (Zdenƒõk Neubauer and others) on Havel¬¥s thought. In the book ‚ÄûObrazy z kulturn√≠ch dƒõjin rusk√© religiozity‚Äú (Chapters from the Cultural History of Russian Religion, 2015) Putna used the methods of post-colonial history and histoire crois√©e. The result is a complex view of various national, cultural and religious traditions (many different ‚ÄûRussias‚Äú). Simultaneously, the book follows specifically Czech tradition (K. Havl√≠ƒçek Borovsk√Ω, T. G. Masaryk, V√°clav ƒåern√Ω) of critical intellectual analysis of Russian culture in its ambivalence toward Europe. The Ukrainian culture is presented here as an ‚Äûalternative‚Äú, pro-European Eastern Slavic tradition. Among his other academic interests are Late Ancient Culture, Ancient impact on European culture, Russian exile literature in the 20th century and the relationship between Christianity and homosexuality.  Civic Engagement  Putna is an outspoken civic opponent of pro-Russian, authoritarian and far-right streams in contemporary Czech society. During the presidential campaign of 2013, he strongly criticised Presidential Candidate Milo≈° Zeman for his pro-Putin leaning. Several months after that, Zeman as newly elected president refused to confirm Putna¬¥s nomination for the title of Professor of social and cultural anthropology. Zeman publicly claimed that the reason for this denial is Putna¬¥s involvement in Prague Gay Pride in 2011. After numerous protests from academic and broader circles, Zeman capitulated. Putna was appointed in June 2013.Putna se doƒçkal profesorsk√©ho dekretu, m√≠sto Zemana mu ho p≈ôedal Fiala, iDNES.cz, 25. 6. 2013 Since 2015, Putna has repeatedly engaged in public actions in support of the Ukraine, against Russian political influence in Czech Republic and against xenophobia.http://forum24.cz/martin-c-putna- rusove-jsou-zvykli-na-styl-ivana-hrozneho-proto-se-jim-putin-tolik-libi/  Selected works  * ƒåesk√° katolick√° literatura v evropsk√©m kontextu 1848-1918.

Over the 69-year period, the journal published 59 volumes and 132 issues, including over 1,300 articles. It was published twice a year at the Rangoon University Estate in both English and Burmese. Until its closure in 1980, the journal was the country's principal scholarly publication. By the mid-1910s, it was also the leading platform in the field of scholarly reviews of Burmese fiction. The journal analyzed a wide range of Burmese culture and Burmese history topics and published ethnographic studies, translations and reviews of Burmese literature, folklore, music and theology, fauna, geography and archaeology reports, historical essays, and annotated texts and essays of historical significance, translated from Burmese, Pali, Mon, and other languages. The journal came under government regulation after 1962. In 1980, it was closed, alongside its publishing body, the Burma Research Society, by the Burma Socialist Programme Party government.

She was the lead ship of her class, which included one other vessel, . Her primary offensive armament consisted of a bow-mounted torpedo tube, and she was armed with a battery of light guns to defend herself against torpedo boats, a sign of the growing importance of torpedoes as effective weapons in the period. The Blitz class featured a number of innovations in German warship design: they were the first steel hulled warships and the first cruiser-type ships to discard traditional sailing rigs. For much of her career, Blitz served as a flotilla leader for groups of torpedo boats. In the 1880s, these duties included conducting demonstrations of torpedo boat capabilities under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz, then the head of torpedo development in the German Navy, who frequently used Blitz as his flagship. She also made numerous trips abroad, including several occasions escorting members of the House of Hohenzollern on visits to Britain, Russia, and elsewhere. By the 1890s, she began to be used in a variety of secondary roles in addition to her normal duties, including as a fisheries protection vessel, a training ship, and a tender. She began to operate as a dedicated tender for various units in the German fleet in the early 1900s. The ship's activities during World War I are unclear, with one historian stating she was employed as a coastal defense vessel until 1915 and then as a tender until the end of the war in 1918, and another trio of historians who state that she remained in service as a tender for the fleet's battleships through 1917, took part in Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea in October 1917, and was slated to participate in Operation Schlu√üstein, the occupation of St. Petersburg, Russia in August 1918 before the operation was cancelled. Blitz was struck from the naval register in March 1921 and subsequently broken up. Design Illustration of Blitz Designed in 1879, the s marked a significant advance in naval technology for the German fleet; they were the first steel- hulled vessels, and they were the first cruiser-type vessels to abandon traditional sailing masts. Their armament‚Äîa torpedo tube and a battery of light guns‚Äîreflected the growing importance of the torpedo as a weapon, since the guns were necessary to defend against the increasingly powerful torpedo boats of the period. Blitz was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. She and her sister ship were the first steel-hulled warships of the German fleet. Blitz had a crew of 7 officers and 127 enlisted men. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2-cylinder double expansion engines. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal-fired locomotive boilers. The ship's propulsion system was rated for and provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . As built, the ship was armed with one K L/23 gun placed in a pivot mount. The gun was supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with four K L/23 guns, also in single pivot mounts and one torpedo tube mounted in the bow. In 1892‚Äì1893, the ship was rearmed with six SK L/30 quick-firing guns in single mounts and three 35 cm torpedo tubes, one in the bow and one on each broadside, all submerged in the hull. She carried no armor protection. Service history Construction ‚Äì 1887 Blitz in Kiel in the late 1880s or early 1890s Blitz was laid down at the Norddeutsche Schiffbau-Gesellschaft shipyard in Kiel in mid-1881. She was launched on 26 August 1882 and commissioned on 28 March 1883 to begin sea trials. Initial testing lasted until 30 April and design defects that were discovered during the trials necessitated corrections at the shipyard. A second round of trials were held between 24 July and 15 December, after which she was decommissioned. The ship was recommissioned on 22 April 1884 and assigned to the armored division to serve as the unit's aviso. The ships conducted training maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas that year, and from 20 to 24 December, they visited Frederikshavn, Denmark during a cruise through the Kattegat and Skagerrak for a test of torpedo boat endurance. The ship spent the first half on 1885 as the aviso for the fleet's ironclads, but beginning on 21 July, she joined the torpedo boat flotillas, serving as the flagship of I Torpedo-boat Division; the ship's commander, Kapit√§nleutnant (KL‚ÄîCaptain Lieutenant) Hugo Zeye also served as the divisional commander. From 6 to 22 August, Blitz led the division on a cruise to Trondheim, Norway as another demonstration of torpedo boats' ability to operate at sea. During the summer maneuvers in August and September, she led her torpedo boats with an armored warship division composed of , , and , and an unarmored division that comprised three old sail corvettes and . At the time, Alfred von Tirpitz, the future architect of the High Seas Fleet, was the Deputy for Torpedo Matters for the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty), and he directed the exercises conducted by the torpedo flotillas. He used Blitz as his flagship during this period. Starting in March 1886, Tirpitz led the flotilla on training exercises that lasted until July. Thereafter, Blitz and her accompanying torpedo boats joined the annual fleet maneuvers as III Division. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers in September, Blitz and the flotilla visited Christiana, Norway. On the way back, Blitz accidentally rammed the British steamer Oakland on 10 September; she was able to rescue only two crewmen from Oakland before she sank. Blitz suffered minor damage, which necessitated repairs in Kiel. After repairs were completed, she joined the fleet for maneuvers that lasted until 23 September. She was decommissioned on 27 October for the winter and returned to service on 4 May 1886. She again served as the flagship of the torpedo boat flotilla for the year, which concluded with the annual autumn maneuvers in September. She was again withdrawn from service on 4 October in Kiel. Blitz was recommissioned on 27 April 1887, again with Tirpitz aboard. She was present for the ceremonial start of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Kiel, after which she steamed around Denmark to Wilhelmshaven. There, she embarked Princes Wilhelm and Heinrich and took them to Britain for the Golden Jubilee of their grandmother Queen Victoria on 20 June. Blitz and the torpedo boats made a favorable impression on observers at the Cowes Regatta, though Wilhelm's complaints about the British doctor treating his terminally-ill father Kaiser Friedrich III achieved the opposite effect for the soon-to-be kaiser. Blitz and the torpedo boats left Britain on 26 June and arrived in Kiel two days later. Training exercises were then held in the Baltic and North Seas, during which Blitz and the torpedo boats formed IV Division, and on 28 September she was decommissioned. 1888‚Äì1899 Blitz in port, 1895 The year 1888 followed the same routine of training exercises in previous years, though now she operated with III Flotilla. In July, she accompanied the fleet that the newly-crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II on a state visit to Tsar Alexander III of Russia from 14 to 31 July. The voyage also included stops in Sweden and Denmark. During the August‚ÄìSeptember fleet maneuvers, she led the fourteen torpedo boats of III Flotilla as part of a squadron defending Wilhelmshaven from a simulated hostile squadron; she led the torpedo boats in a mock attack on the fleet. Blitz was decommissioned in late September; the outbreak of the Abushiri revolt in German East Africa prompted the navy to consider sending Blitz to join the East Africa Squadron, but the proposal was abandoned. She remained in German waters in 1889, conducting training maneuvers with the torpedo boats in July and escorting Wilhelm II on a voyage to Britain in mid- September. She was present for a torpedo demonstration that involved the sinking of the old gunboat . The year 1890 passed without incident; Blitz escorted Wilhelm II on a visit to Norway and she was present for the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control (by way of the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty). The year's fleet maneuvers that August‚ÄìSeptember followed a similar arrangement to the previous year's, with Blitz and the torpedo boats defending Germany's Baltic coast against a simulated Russian blockade. During the 1891 training year, the torpedo-boat flotilla was joined by the Training Squadron for exercises. Blitz was used to train boiler room personnel in 1892, and over the winter of 1892‚Äì1893, the ship was modernized with new quick-firing guns. Her conning tower and chart house were relocated, along with other alterations to the ship. She was recommissioned on 1 July 1893, and from 17 to 24 July she accompanied the Kaiser's yacht Hohenzollern on a cruise to Gotland, followed immediately by another visit to the Cowes Regatta from 27 July to 10 August. She was decommissioned on arrival in Kiel on 18 August. Blitz initially served as a training ship for boiler room crews in 1894, and beginning on 18 April she became the flotilla leader for I Flotilla. During a night attack practice in late July, Pfeil and the torpedo boat accidentally collided and Blitz had to tow the torpedo boat back to port. During the 1894 maneuvers, which postulated a two-front war against France and Russia, Blitz remained in the Baltic to defend against the simulated Russian attack. The next year followed the same pattern and passed without incident until August, when she was relieved as the flotilla leader by . Blitz thereafter served as the tender for the artillery training ship for the rest of 1895. In 1896, the ship served as a flotilla leader and later as a dispatch boat for the corvette , which served as the fleet flagship during training exercises that year. She was present for the naval review held for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia during his visit to Kiel that August. The ship served as a tender for the pre-dreadnought battleship , the flagship of I Squadron in 1897. During the summer maneuvers that year, Blitz and Pfeil served in the simulated hostile squadron. She spent most of 1898 as a training vessel, though she was briefly used as a squadron tender. The ship was assigned to the Naval Artillery Inspectorate and was used to train auto- cannon crews from February to April 1899. Beginning on 16 September, she was employed as a fishery protection vessel, along with the old aviso . During this period, she patrolled off the mouth of the Humber, the Dogger Bank, and in the southern North Sea. She returned to Kiel on 26 November and thereafter reverted to the Naval Artillery Inspectorate. 1900‚Äì1921 Blitz or at sea c. 1914 She performed fishery protection duties in 1900 until 14 April, when she returned to the torpedo boat flotillas. During training maneuvers on 10 May, the torpedo boat struck Blitz and seriously damaged her rudder, forcing her to go to the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel for repairs. She served as a scout for the Maneuver Fleet during the autumn exercises that lasted from 15 August to 15 September. She operated as part of the simulated German fleet under the command of Admiral Wilhelm B√ºchsel Following the conclusion of the exercises, she was decommissioned in Kiel on 22 September. She was moved to the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for a thorough overhaul that included the installation of new boilers; work lasted until early 1903. She was recommissioned on 25 April, thereafter joining the fleet's scouting unit on 2 May. She steamed with the fleet on a major training cruise into the Atlantic in July and August, during which she was used as a dispatch boat and a squadron tender. Beginning on 25 September, she became a tender for the fleet's battleships, a role she filled for the next fifteen years. She initially served with the fleet flagship, . In 1904, Blitz was transferred support the battleships of I Battle Squadron, though during the summer training exercises she reverted to Kaiser Wilhelm II. She joined the fleet for a cruise to the Shetland Islands and Norway, after which she had to return to the shipyard in Kiel on 1 September for repairs to her engines and boilers, which had suffered breakdowns during the cruise. The work was completed quickly and she was able to take part in the autumn maneuvers that year. The year 1905 followed the same routine, with the ship alternating between I Squadron and Kaiser Wilhelm II, though she also served temporarily with the scouting unit. She was present for a cruise to Norway in 1906, along with a fleet review in Hamburg involving the German Flottenverein (Navy League) from 29 April to 20 May. The years 1907, 1908, and 1909 passed uneventfully and Blitz remained in Germany during the fleet cruises to the Atlantic and to Spain in those years. In need of another overhaul by 1910, Blitz went into dry dock at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for repairs that lasted from 30 April to 1 August. She was transferred from the list of cruisers to the list of special ships on 8 December. She was reassigned to Wilhelmshaven for her home port in 1911, but she was damaged on the way, requiring repairs in Danzig that were completed by early 1912. She finally arrived at her new home port on 1 April. She saw little activity in 1913 and remained in port when the fleet made its annual summer cruise to Norway. She was present at the ceremonies at D√ºne, Helgoland on 23 May for the unveiling of a memorial to the crews of the torpedo boats and , the transport vessel Unterelbe, and the zeppelin L 1, the latter having been lost in the Helgoland Island air disaster the previous year. Blitz and Pfeil carried observers from Cuxhaven to Helgoland and back. The ship accompanied the fleet on its cruise to Norway from 6 to 25 June, which included stops in Odda and Balestrand. The ship's activities during World War I are unclear; according to the historian Erich Gr√∂ner, Blitz was mobilized for coastal defense patrols in August, serving in this capacity until 1915 when she reverted to tender duties. Gr√∂ner states that she saw no other use until the end of the war. The historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz disagree, stating that she remained in her tender role for I Squadron for the first three years of the war, before serving in the fleet that conducted Operation Albion‚Äîthe amphibious assault on the islands in the Gulf of Riga‚Äîin October 1917. They also note that she was slated to take part in Operation Schlu√üstein, the planned occupation of St. Petersburg, Russia, in August 1918. The other ships included in the special unit created to carry the operation out included the battleships , , and . The ships entered the Baltic on 10 August but the operation was postponed and then cancelled, with the special unit being dissolved on 21 August. Both agree that she was struck from the naval register on 8 March 1921 and then broken up in Wilhelmshaven.

Daniel Clemente (born October 14, 1936) is a prominent American attorney, business executive, and consultant. He is the founder and CEO of Clemente Development Company, Inc., a real estate property management and development company based in Tysons Corner, Virginia. Clemente is a noted expert on real estate bankruptcy and corporate liquidation and has served as a court- appointed Receiver and Trustee for numerous companies. He is the former chair of the Board of Visitors for George Mason University, holding the position from July 2012 through June 2014. He currently serves on the Board of Directors for the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. Early life Clemente was born Costantino Daniel Clemente in Manhattan to Louis James and Amelia T. Clemente. His father was a surgeon who served in World War II as a Major in the U.S. Army. Clemente grew up in Brooklyn, attended the Brooklyn Preparatory School and matriculated to Fordham University, where he received his B.S. in economics in 1958. Following a year of postgraduate work at Marquette University, Clemente attended Georgetown University Law Center and was a member of the law review. He graduated with a J.D. in 1963 and was admitted to the bar in the same year. Business career Clemente began working as an attorney dealing with defaulted real estate transactions and bankruptcies for local banks in Springfield, Virginia. He opened his first law firm and development company in 1965 with his business partner Charles Edward Taylor. The company developed and built Tower Villas, the first residential condominium complex in Virginia. All of the condominiums in the complex were sold before construction was completed. Following a series of additional residential and commercial projects, Clemente exited real estate development at the onset of the mid-1970s recession and began to work with banking institutions on distressed assets. He also helped found two community banks in Northern Virginia, Community Bank and Trust in Springfield and First Commercial Bank in Arlington. By the 1980s, his expertise in dealing with bad loan portfolios and real estate made him one of the foremost experts on the topic in the United States and a qualified expert witness for numerous court cases. During the savings and loan crisis, Clemente was nominated by Virginia Senator John Warner to serve as chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). While the position went to Al Casey, Clemente worked closely with the RTC throughout its existence, as a preferred contractor through Clemente Development Company, Inc., CDC Debt Recovery Group, Inc., and CDC Consulting Group, Inc. Serving as an advisor to the RTC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Clemente managed the restructuring and sale of real estate portfolios obtained during the crisis. Despite his work with the RTC, Clemente was one of its most prominent critics, calling into question the distortionary impact of the RTC in the real estate market. Clemente testified before the Senate Banking Committee of the United States Congress and provided several editorials to The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post that called into question the fundamental process undertaken by the RTC to quickly sell the property it obtained. Clemente felt that the immediate liquidation of the troubled assets by the RTC benefited a small group of investors at taxpayers' expense and caused distortions in the real estate market. After parting ways with the RTC following its closure, Clemente served as a consultant to banking institutions, the Federal Government, and real estate developers. He also refocused his company on commercial property development, purchasing several office buildings in the greater Washington, DC area. For his property development work, Clemente was named one of the 50 most influential Virginians by Virginia Business in 2018. Clemente served as an asset consultant to members of the Kohler family during a stock buyback undertaken by the Kohler Company in 1998. He again served as consultant for members of the Cargill family during a similar dispute with Cargill management and its shareholders. He also served as the attorney for Muhammad Ali and worked as a court- appointed trustee cleaning up securities fraud cases before retiring from law in 2002. Politics Clemente has also been extensively involved in politics, both on a national level and in Virginia. He chaired Alexander Haig's 1988 bid for the Republican Party's nomination for President. After Haig dropped out of the race, Clemente was recruited by Roger Ailes to serve on the senior campaign staff of George H.W. Bush. He also supported the efforts of former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman to run as an independent alternative to the Republican nominee Oliver North during the 1994 U.S. Senate race in Virginia. The presence of Coleman on the ballot hampered North's support and led to the re-election of the Democratic nominee Chuck Robb. Clemente is the former Rector for George Mason University, first elected by the Board of Visitors in July 2012 and serving until the end of June 2014. He was originally appointed to the Board by Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell in July 2010. In recognition of his service to George Mason University, Clemente was awarded the Mason Medal in October, 2014. The Mason Medal is the university's highest honor, bestowed upon those with distinguished records of public service. Clemente was also commended by the Virginia General Assembly for his contributions to George Mason University and the Commonwealth of Virginia. More recently, Clemente has served on the Board of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership since being appointed on January 10, 2014. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) is an organization created by the Virginia General Assembly in 1995 to encourage and support the development and expansion of the economy of the state. As a member of the Board, Clemente was elected as the Vice Chairman in June, 2015 and subsequently was tabbed to lead VEDP's Legislation and Policy Committee. On June 9, 2016, Clemente was elected Chairman of VEDP by his fellow members, succeeding Chris Lumsden. He served in that capacity until 2017, when the Board was restructured by the Virginia General Assembly. Clemente was subsequently reappointed as a member of the new Board in June 2017. Clemente was also appointed to the Attorney General's Government and Regulatory Reform Task Force by McDonnell when the latter served as Virginia's Attorney General. Clemente has also served other Virginia Governors as well, with former Governor Mark Warner appointing him to the Governor's Advisory Council on Revenue Estimates. He also was appointed by former Governor Douglas Wilder to chair the Virginia Economic Recovery Commission's Committee of Capital Formation.  Philanthropy  Clemente serves on the board of Friends of Clemyjontri, an organization that supports Clemyjontri Park in McLean, Virginia. This park and playground is designed so that it is completely accessible for all individuals, including children and adults with special needs. The park features several modifications and additions to ensure all visitors can enjoy the park and playground experience. Of particular note is the Liberty Swing, a specially modified wheelchair-accessible swing, the first of its kind in Virginia. In recognition of his work with Clemyjontri Park, Clemente was given the honorary title of Lord Fairfax by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. Clemente has also been a benefactor for several universities and numerous artistic endeavors.

Her primary offensive armament consisted of a bow-mounted torpedo tube, and she was armed with a battery of light guns to defend herself against torpedo boats, a sign of the growing importance of torpedoes as effective weapons in the period. The Blitz class featured a number of innovations in German warship design: they were the first steel hulled warships and the first cruiser-type ships to discard traditional sailing rigs. Pfeil served in a variety of roles in her long career in the German fleet. She initially operated with the training squadron in the late 1880s, conducting exercises and training cruises. In late 1888, she was commissioned to reinforce the East Africa Squadron then in the midst of suppressing the Abushiri revolt against colonial rule in German East Africa. She helped to conduct a blockade of the coast, contributed men to landing parties, and bombarded rebel troops. She operated with the Maneuver Squadron through the 1890s and also saw service as a fishery protection vessel and a training ship for engine room crews. Pfeil was involved in a number of accidents, including accidentally colliding with a lightship in 1890, a torpedo boat in 1894, and a schooner in 1898 (sinking the latter vessel). After the start of World War I in August 1914, the ship was used to support the flotilla of torpedo boats that guarded the mouth of the Elbe until June 1915, when she was withdrawn for use as a tender for the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Decommissioned in December 1918, she was struck from the naval register in February 1922 and broken up in Wilhelmshaven. Design Illustration of the Blitz class Designed in 1879, the s marked a significant advance in naval technology for the German fleet; they were the first steel-hulled vessels, and they were the first cruiser-type vessels to abandon traditional sailing masts. Their armament‚Äîa torpedo tube and a battery of light guns‚Äîreflected the growing importance of the torpedo as a weapon, since the guns were necessary to defend against the increasingly powerful torpedo boats of the period. Pfeil was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. She and her sister ship were the first steel-hulled warships of the German fleet. Pfeil had a crew of 7 officers and 127 enlisted men. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 2-cylinder double expansion engines. Steam for the engines was provided by eight coal- fired cylindrical boilers. The ship's propulsion system was rated for and provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . As built, the ship was armed with one K L/23 gun placed in a pivot mount. The gun was supplied with 100 rounds of ammunition. The ship was also equipped with four K L/23 guns, also in single pivot mounts. Pfeil also carried one torpedo tube mounted in the bow. In 1891‚Äì1892, the ship was rearmed with six SK L/30 guns in single mounts and three 35 cm torpedo tubes, one in the bow and one on each broadside, all submerged in the hull. She carried no armor protection. Service history Construction ‚Äì 1892 Map of German East Africa from 1890 Pfeil was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven in mid-1881. She was launched on 16 September 1882, and her launching ceremony was attended by Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty), and Prince Heinrich, then a Leutnant zur See (Lieutenant at Sea); Heinrich performed the christening of the ship. Pfeil was commissioned for sea trials on 25 November 1884, though these lasted just two weeks before she was decommissioned for the winter months. The ship returned to active service on 22 June 1885 to join the training squadron with its flagship, the screw corvette . At that time, the squadron also included the screw corvettes and . Independent division exercises took place in June, and in August, the divisions, which also included an armored division composed of several ironclads and a torpedo boat division led by Pfeils sister ship , joined for combined fleet maneuvers that lasted until September. Pfeil spent 1886 out of commission, but she was recommissioned in 1887 for aviso duty with the Maneuver Squadron, the main unit of the German fleet at that time. In 1888, the Abushiri revolt, a major uprising against German colonial rule in German East Africa, prompted the navy to send reinforcements to the colony. Pfeil was recommissioned on 12 November to join the unprotected cruiser , which were to be deployed there. While on the way, Pfeil suffered storm damage in the North Sea and had to stop in Plymouth for repairs that delayed her arrival until 4 January 1889. Upon reaching the area, she joined the East Africa Squadron, under the command of Konteradmiral Karl August Deinhard, who flew his flag in the screw corvette . Deinhard initially ordered Pfeil to take up blockade duties along the coast from Bagamoyo to Mafia Island. On 1 March, he sent Pfeil to patrol off Zanzibar; over the course of her time on blockade duty, she inspected 411 merchant ships, the most of any warship in the unit. Leipzig, Pfeil, and Schwalbe shelled Saadani on 6 June and sent men ashore to attack rebels there. Pfeil was the first steel-hulled, unrigged warship ever sent by Germany to its African colonies, though her steel hull rendered her unsuitable to long-term deployments to the tropics, and she was detached on 29 September to return home. While on the way back to Germany, Pfeil was ordered to join the armored division, which was on a training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea at the time. Leipzig was also instructed to join the division. Kaiser Wilhelm II was cruising with the division in his yacht Hohenzollern, and wished to be briefed by Deinhard on the situation in East Africa. Pfeil met the unit on 26 October in Piraeus, Greece, while Leipzig joined the ships off the island of Mytilene on 1 November. Hohenzollern was at that time in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, and she arrived five days later. Deinhard delivered his report on 6 November, after which all of the German ships steamed to Venice, Italy, where Pfeil underwent repairs. From there, she departed for Wilhelmshaven, arriving there on 6 December. She was decommissioned there on seven days later. Pfeil was recommissioned on 1 April 1890, once again to serve as the aviso for the Maneuver Squadron. She took Admiral Max von der Goltz to make an official visit to the British Admiralty and to greet the training squadron returning from the Mediterranean. Later that year, Pfeil accompanied Hohenzollern on Wilhelm II's state visit to Christiana, Norway, followed by the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control (by way of the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty). While on the way back from Helgoland, she accidentally collided with the lightship at the location. In October, she joined the training squadron for another cruise in the Mediterranean, which included a visit to Constantinople. The ships arrived back in Germany on 18 April 1891. During exercises in the Baltic Sea on 26 June, she assisted the armored division flagship, , which had run aground in Danzig Bay. Pfeil was decommissioned on 8 March 1892 for a major overhaul. 1894‚Äì1922 Pfeil or at sea c. 1914 The ship was recommissioned again on 3 April 1894 for service with the Maneuver Squadron. The unit conducted major exercises in the North Sea in July, during which Pfeil collided with the torpedo boat . Later that year, the ship was used for fishery protection duties. In December, Pfeil escorted Wilhelm II for a visit to Sweden for celebrations marking the 300th birthday of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. She returned to the Maneuver Squadron on 1 January 1895; the year included six weeks of torpedo training conducted by the Torpedo Inspectorate. She was detached from the squadron on 18 December. She was used as a training ship for engine room personnel beginning on 28 August 1897, and she was employed as a scout for the fleet during the annual autumn maneuvers. Following the conclusion of the maneuvers, she was sent on 21 September to replace the aviso on fishery protection patrols in the North Sea, the latter vessel needing repairs. On 30 November, Pfeil returned to aviso duties with I Squadron, which lasted until 16 December. She thereafter resumed training ship duties until 30 April 1898; during this period, she ran aground off Hilderum while on a training cruise though she was not damaged in the accident. On 30 April, she returned to the fleet, and while on a cruise in the western Baltic, she collided with the Dutch schooner Leentje, accidentally sinking the merchant vessel. The coastal defense ship suffered a machinery breakdown in early September, and Pfeil towed her back to Kiel for repairs. Pfeil was then decommissioned on 21 September. She returned to service on 16 March 1900 for fishery protection duties, though during this period she was temporarily attached to I Squadron for the unit's maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas. Decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 29 September, she was later moved to Danzig for a major overhaul in 1903. She was recommissioned on 30 March 1904, serving as an aviso and a tender for II Squadron. The only event of note for Pfeil in 1906 was her attendance of a large fleet review in Hamburg on 19‚Äì20 May. In November that year, she went to the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for another overhaul. She was recommissioned on 6 April 1907, serving as II Squadron's tender through 1910; this period passed uneventfully. She was transferred to the list of special ships on 8 December 1910. The next year, she was used to tow the damaged torpedo boat to Frederikshavn, Denmark, after it was damaged during fleet training exercises on 14 March. The year 1912 passed uneventfully, and on 30 March 1913, she was transferred to the newly-formed Training Squadron, remaining there until 21 April. Following the outbreak of World War I, she continued to serve as the tender for II Squadron. She was later reassigned to IV Battle Squadron. She was also used to support the harbor flotilla based in the mouth of the Elbe until 28 June 1915. Pfeill was then placed at the disposition of the command staff of the High Seas Fleet, and was also used to train U-boat crews. She towed the pre-dreadnought battleship to Wilhelmshaven in June 1916. Following the end of the war, she was decommissioned on 17 December 1918. She was stricken from the naval register on 16 February 1922 and broken up for scrap at Wilhelmshaven.

He attended Oklahoma State University (OSU) at Stillwater and played college baseball for the Cowboys. The New York Yankees selected him in the 10th round of the 2009 amateur draft, but he chose to remain at OSU. The next year, the St. Louis Cardinals made him a ninth round pick, and he signed. Along with the Yankees, he has played in MLB for the St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates. In 2011, while pitching for the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League in the minor leagues, Lyons pitched the first no-hitter in team history. He is a three-time recipient of the Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Week Award. High school and college Born in Lubbock, Texas, Lyons attended Frenship High School where he was a multi-sport athlete. He lettered in football for three years and was selected as an all-state quarterback his senior year. On the baseball field, Lyons was a two-time district MVP and was named All-City Player of the Year his senior season by the Lubbock Avalanche- Journal. Lyons attended Oklahoma State University where he majored in sport management and played baseball for the Cowboys from 2007 to 2010. In 2008 he posted 12 wins, fourth-best nationally, while earning second-team All-Big 12 honors. He was strong in the classroom as well, being named first-team Academic All-Big 12. In the summer of 2008, Lyons was chosen to play for Team USA. His 11 appearances without giving up an earned run helped the team to a 24-0 record and a gold medal in the FISU World Championships. In 2009 Lyons tied for the team lead with seven wins, while earning an All-Big 12 honorable mention. He played collegiate summer baseball in 2009 for the Chatham Anglers of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Professional career Minor Leagues The New York Yankees drafted Lyons in the 10th round of the 2009 amateur draft, but he chose to return to OSU. The Cardinals selected him in the ninth round in 2010, and he signed. Lyons signed too late to play in the Cardinals minor league system in 2010; however, in 2011 he pitched for the Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League. On August 8, 2011, he threw the first no-hitter in Palm Beach's history, a 10‚Äì0 win over the Fort Myers Miracle. Lyons struck out eight and faced two batters over the minimum in his eighth career professional start. He finished the 2011 season with an overall record of 9-4 with an ERA of 4.50 over 94 innings pitched. Lyons split the 2012 season between the Cardinals Double-A affiliate Springfield Cardinals of the Texas League and Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). In 12 starts for Springfield, he was 5-4 with a 3.92 ERA. Lyons struggled to adjust, however, after moving up to Memphis, going just 4-9 with a 4.28 ERA over 88 innings (15 starts) for the Redbirds. St. Louis Cardinals =2013= Lyons started the 2013 season with Memphis, posting a record of 2‚Äì1 in eight starts with a 4.47 ERA prior to his first major league call-up. He made his major league debut with the Cardinals on May 22, 2013, against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park, allowing one run and four hits over seven innings as the Cardinals won, 5‚Äì3. After winning his first two games, Lyons began to struggle on the mound. On June 22 the Cardinals optioned Lyons to Triple A Memphis and called up Michael Blazek. In his previous four starts, Lyons gave up at least four earned runs in each start and saw his ERA climb to 5.51; his ultimate appearance lasted just innings on June 21 against the Texas Rangers. Lyons made six more appearances ‚Äì two starts ‚Äì in the rest of 2013, and finished the year 2‚Äì4 with a 4.75 ERA in 12 games. The Cardinals appeared in the World Series, but left Lyons off the playoff roster. =2014= Beginning the 2014 season again in Memphis, Lyons made three starts before the Cardinals recalled him on April 21 to replace the injured Joe Kelly in the rotation. He made four starts with two relief appearances sandwiched between as the temporary fifth starter, going 0‚Äì3 with a 6.12 ERA and 23 strikeouts in 25 innings. Following a May 12 start in which he gave up 9 runs in 4 innings pitched, he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain, and replaced in the rotation by Jaime Garc√≠a. Lyons pitched most of the rest of the season in Memphis, where he had a six-game streak of winning his starts. In St. Louis in 2014, Lyons went 0-4 in 11 appearances (four starts), posting a 4.42 ERA with 36 strikeouts and a 1.200 WHIP. =2015= Filling roles as a sixth starter and swingman in 2015, the Cardinals recalled Lyons from Memphis to replace injured starters, including Adam Wainwright and Lance Lynn. After a brief stint in April, the club optioned Lyons back to Memphis. For the week ending June 7, he named PCL Pitcher of the week after defeating both the Salt Lake Bees and Iowa Cubs. Combined, he allowed a 0.00 ERA, 0.54 WHIP and .136 batting average against while striking out 13 in 13 IP. The Cardinals then recalled him to replace Lynn. Lyons made his next MLB start on June 13, stopping a winless streak of 13 MLB starts by pitching a 3‚Äì2 victory over the Kansas City Royals. He struck out five in six innings. Lyons' next start, against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 19, was his second win of the season by a 12‚Äì4 margin. While hitting, he collected his first major league run batted in and base on balls and hit two singles. He reached base and scored in all three plate appearances.

The subject matter ranges from the nature and limits of life on Earth to the current search for exoplanets and the prospects of intelligent life in the universe. The book was published as a hardcover by Cambridge University Press in 2010. Summary Talking About Life: Conversations on Astrobiology is a book of interviews between astronomer Chris Impey and leading researchers in the effort to understand life on Earth and discover habitable worlds and biology beyond Earth. The book is a snapshot of a fast-moving interdisciplinary field, with a conversational tone, where researchers describe what they do in their own words and convey the excitement of addressing fundamental questions about the universe. The first section has a range of perspectives on the general topic of life in the universe. Timothy Ferris, noted writer and journalist, talks about being involved in the planning for the Voyager record and on astrobiology in the popular culture. Steven Dick and Iris Fry talk about the history of the search for life in the universe and the history of theories of the origin of life on Earth, respectively. Ann Druyan discusses her long association with Carl Sagan and her work in science education. Neil Tyson, Director of the Hayden Planetarium, talks about our halting progress in space travel and the prospects for venturing to find life among the stars. George ‚ÄúPinky‚Äù Nelson gives an astronaut‚Äôs perspective on life on Earth and elsewhere, and Steve Benner and William Bains speculate on altering the architecture of life on Earth and on how strange life beyond Earth may be. The second section of the book turns to the history of life on Earth. Roger Buick talks about the earliest evidence for biology and John Baross talks about its possible origin on the sea floor. Lynn Rothschild talks about extremophiles and the extraordinary modes of adaptation of terrestrial organisms. Joe Kirschvink presents the evidence for Snowball Earth and the challenges that a restless planet presents for biology. Andrew Knoll and Simon Conway Morris discuss natural selection and the contrasting themes of contingency and convergence. As two examples of \\"alien\\" intelligence on Earth, Roger Hanlon talks about his field work with octopuses and Lori Marino talks about her research on dolphins. Turning to the Solar System, the next section of the book looks at the prospects for life on our doorstep. Chris McKay and Peter Smith talk about Mars and the potential for extant microbial life under the surface layer. Speculating about more exotic habitats for life, David Grinspoon considers Venus and Jupiter‚Äôs moon Io, then Jonathan Lunine considers Saturn‚Äôs large moon Titan. Carolyn Porco notes the surprising results from the Cassini mission, including the habitability of Enceladus. The biological potential of meteorites is the subject of the interviews with Laurie Leshin and Jesuit Guy Consolmagno, who note the presence of the complex building blocks of life in this primordial material from the outer Solar System. The next section of the book covers the fast- moving research on planets around other stars. Alan Boss discusses the theory of extrasolar planets or exoplanets, and ace planet-hunters Debra Fischer and Geoff Marcy talk about their properties and the technical innovations that led to their discovery. Sara Seager summarizes efforts to characterize exoplanets in detail, and David Charbonneau talks about the power of the transit method for detecting low mass and Earth-like planets. Last, Vicky Meadows describes how planet models will be used to predict the spectral biomarkers that could indirectly indicate the presence of microbial life on an exoplanet. Talking About Life ends with the search for intelligent life (SETI) and speculation about the role of life in the universe. Jill Tarter and Seth Shostak describe the strategies that have been used to listen for artificial signal from technological civilizations far from Earth for over fifty years, so far without success. Ray Kurzweil talks about postbiological evolution and Nick Bostrom talks about transhumanism and the odds that the entire universe, and our sense of it and ourselves, is a simulation by a super-intelligent civilization. Next, Paul Davies and Martin Rees talk about fine-tuning and the anthropic principle, which each indicate that biology has a privileged role in the cosmos. To round out the book with a humanistic perspective, Ben Bova talks about our future in space and Jennifer Michael Hecht rekindles our delight in alien yet familiar life on Earth.

One of the coasters was transferred to the Million Dollar Pier as \\"The Skooter\\" in Atlantic City, New Jersey at the park's demise. Other famous rides \\"... included the famous Hummer roller coaster, the Whip, and the Wild Cat.\\" The FPT's trolley line ran for around 10 miles around the park that also included parts of West Philadelphia and Strawberry Mansion. Also in the park was a third-mile wooden cycling track, which was used by Major Taylor to break many world records in 1898. The introduction of the trolley also introduced \\"non-bourgeois elements\\", and the park lost its \\"middle class tone.\\" As a result, many who visited the park never returned and started patronage towards its competitor Willow Grove Park, which by comparison was less of an amusement park than was Woodside Park, but offered fewer concerts than its competitor. Woodside Park was comparable to New York's Coney Island and allowed residents quicker visits as it was nearby. The Please Touch Museum now holds the Dentzel carousel that once ran in the park. An article published in the New York Times on October 7, 1955,(P.50) stated that a syndicate of real estate investors based in Philadelphia, and headed by Lewis Silverman, had purchased the park's rides and intended to relocate the park to a new \\"two million dollar\\" amusement park to have been constructed in Levittown, Pennsylvania. However, the Levittown amusement park was never built.

In each building, Richard navigates service corridors to link the electrical wires between each room, As he does so, animals threaten to chew through the wires. When an electrical connection is complete, the live wires illuminate the connected rooms and electrocute the animals on contact. If Richard touches any of the rats, bats, or giant insects in the corridor, he loses a life. In the buildings, the player earns points by illuminating rooms and electrocuting any rats, bats, and insects. Occasionally, a burglar appears; intercepting him rewards the player with bonus points and an extra life. After wiring all the rooms in an apartment building, the player exits and navigates a dark sewer to the next building. In the sewer, the player must avoid alligators.

Haiselden, the chief surgeon at the German-American Hospital in Chicago. The Black Stork is Haiselden's fictionalized account of his eugenic infanticide of the child John Bollinger. The film was re-released in 1927 under the title Are You Fit to Marry? Bollinger case On November 17, 1915, Harry J. Haiselden, despite public protest, allowed the syphilitic child John Bollinger to die. Haiselden convinced the child's parents that John would have grown up to be a miserable outcast and that death was this child's best option as well as in the best interests of society. As the child was dying, an unknown kidnapper attempted to save John and the Catholic community protested the action; however activist Helen Keller and attorney Clarence Darrow each wrote separate articles in support of Dr. Haiselden's choice. Dr. Haiselden was an outspoken supporter of the eugenics movement prior to the case and, after the publicity made him famous, he took eugenics onto the national stage. Haiselden was ultimately acquitted by a jury for allowing John Bollinger to die. The Illinois Board of Health attempted to revoke Haiselden's medical license but that action was dropped. A coroner's jury determined that the child was not syphilitic, but brain damaged and therefore defective. The Chicago Medical Society expelled Haiselden from their membership for The Black Stork and the publicity that he sought out after the infanticide. Film The film revolves around a Dr. Dickey, played by and based on Harry J. Haiselden, who is called in to operate in order to save the life of a \\"defective\\" child. Dr. Dickey refuses to operate on the child as he is seen refusing his apron from the nurse. Other doctors save the child and he grows up as a shunned monstrosity. He later returns to kill the doctor who \\"condemned [him] to life.\\" The mother then wakes up from her nightmare and realizes that she and her fiance need to get tested to ensure that they will have \\"fit\\" offspring. They pass the exam and have a happy and healthy child. The film concludes with Congress passing mandatory premarital testing legislation in order to prevent defective children. Images of handicapped individuals are inter-played throughout the film. The reviews for Haiselden's film were mixed. Rarely did people directly criticize his message but rather they attacked his egotism and his poor production values. Haiselden wanted his film to become a date night movie for couples but that angle failed when the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures as well as most local censors barred men and women from viewing the film together. The film took over a year to go from production to the public theaters due to the controversy. Several changes were forced upon Haiselden by the NBRMP. The NBRMP's Executive Committee, after overruling a 9-0 vote by the Advisory Committee against the film, approved it conditionally provided that Haiselden make 18 modifications to the film. One major change was removing all references to God and what were deemed the most inappropriate images. This year-long review process hurt the opening of the film because prints began to circulate illegally in 1917 so when it officially debuted in 1918 there was little fanfare. The film continued to circulate as late as 1942, uncoincidentally the same period as when the first reports of the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany began to appear in the United States. The popularity of eugenics and The Black Stork both declined simultaneously with World War II. Most copies of the original film have been destroyed: fewer than four partials are known to exist today.

The facility has sixty beds and provided services to Michigan youth who require intensive or specialized rehabilitation treatment and a high level of security and structure. Maxey closed on October 1, 2015 due to budget cuts in Michigan. Services Individual and group services were supervised by clinical professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and certified social workers. Programming areas included sex offender treatment, substance abuse treatment, criminal behavior treatment, and behavioral health treatment. Additional services provided by the facility included mental and physical health care, community reintegration, restorative justice, and spiritual development.  Educational services  Maxey School provided a full-day, year-round educational program accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. All teachers were state-certified educators and special education services are available. Students were provided with a curriculum targeted toward completion of their high school degree or GED. Students were also provided training in life skills and vocational areas such as construction trades, cosmetology, and graphic design. History Following visits by consultants in the fields of juvenile justice management, medical and mental health care, fire safety protection, and education in March and April 2003, the US Department of Justice concluded on April 19, 2004 that \\"certain conditions at Maxey violate the constitutional and/or statutory rights of juveniles confined at the facility.\\" The state agreed to comply with recommendations made by the Department of Justice. In April 2012, some Michigan state legislators wanted to close all state juvenile justice facilities in the state, including Maxey. The closings were not part of the Governor's recommended budget, but were added during the House Appropriations Committee review. On October 1, 2015, Maxey was closed at the start of the State's 2016 fiscal year. Maxey staff worked with judges to reassign the youth other facilities. Of the 48 youth at Maxey when the facility closed, 18 went to Michigan's other two juvenile correction facilities, 16 went to private agencies, eight went home to relatives, three entered supervised independent living programs, two went to Job Corps, and one was transferred to a county- run program. The first transfer happened in June 2015 and the final transfer occurred on September 30. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported to a Michigan legislative panel on November 3 that one former inmate was jailed on a weapons charge and another failed to return to their new program after a weekend break. Both had been transferred to Job Corps. The department indicated it planned to monitor former inmates of the facility for two years.

It was founded in 1938 initially named as Lucena Catholic School. The school is part of the mission of the Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic, and formerly known as Maryknoll Academy. The school has basic education which is composed of primary and secondary education, and also has higher education.  History  http://maryhillcollege.edu.ph/index.php/about/historyThe history of Maryhill College dates back to 1938 when Bishop of Lipa His Excellency Alfredo Versoza, D.D.,together with Rev.Fr.Ulric Arcand,MEP a Canadian Priest who belong to Paris Foreign Missions Society and Don Daniel Marquez envisioned to have a Maryknoll school in Lucena they labored for the construction of a school building and was initially called Lucena Catholic School. the moment of grace was coupled with the arrival of first Maryknoll Sisters in the same year; they were Sr. Mary de Chantal, Sr. Maria Concepcion, and Sr. Maura Shaun. The intensified school Operation focused on these goals: to lead souls to God, to train the minds of the students by providing solid Catholic Education preparing them for life, and to form a lay apostolate among the youth who would fearlessly and intelligently keep the faith alive and responsibly share it with others. The Maryknoll Sisters, imbued with spiritual in-depth, educational leadership skills and passion for spiritual formation, forged the first 250 students to learning. Eventually the school officially named as Maryknoll Academy, the school momentarily ceased operation due to the outbreak of World War II in 1941.

Transition from Maryknoll Sisters to Diocese and Lay Administration After the Second Vatican Council, the Maryknoll congregation began to evaluate its work in the light of their original apostolate as a missionary order. In the 1960s, the Maryknoll congregation saw the readiness of the Filipino Catholic to continue the education mission they had started. In 1977, the ownership of the school turnover to Roman Catholic Diocese of Lucena and management of the school was turned over to lay administrators. In accordance with the agreement, the name Maryknoll was to be changed to pave the way for the promotion of the school‚Äôs unique identity, distinct although not disconnected from the identity of the Maryknoll sisters. In 1976, after a series of consultations, Maryknoll Academy was renamed Maryhill Academy. The administration was entrusted to Ms. Lourdes C. Glinoga as Directress; Mr. Victor Panopio, as High School Principal and Mrs. Corazon C. Belarmino, as Grade School Principal.

The course was divided into six week- long modules and covered the topics of: What is gender?, Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender, Who is producing comic book culture?, Femininity, Masculinity, and Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics.https://learn.canvas.net/courses/23/files/21549/download?verifier=FpgcVPH5Lh0uzjpHRImwtJL4Wdun9WMJrglnCxbt Significant to the course content were the interviews with prominent comic book creators: Terry Moore author of Strangers in Paradise; Mark Waid, writer for Superman; Kelly Sue DeConnick, Steve Wacker, and Sana Amanant, creators of the new Captain Marvel; Gail Simone author of Secret Six; Scott Snyder author of Swamp Thing; and Brian K. Vaughn author of Y: The Last Man. Students could put questions forth in the discussion boards for the class, or use a Twitter hashtag to tweet questions during the interviews.  Week One: What is gender?  Week one was an introduction into what gender is, and how gender differs from sex. Readings for this week included Strangers in Paradise, volumes 1 and 2, and the first issue of Rachel Rising, all by writer/artist Terry Moore. The week's interview was with Moore, as well. Additional reading for the introduction to gender was the article \\"Night to His Day\\": The Social Construction of Gender by Judith Lorber.http://www.tannerhiggin.com/summer11eng1c/wp- content/uploads/2011/06/social_constructions.pdf  Week Two: Gender and Culture: How we learn our gender  Week two discussed how gender is learned. Blanch interviewed Mark Waid, and the comic book selections were Action Comics #1 (the first appearance of Superman) and #267, and Waid's Birthright series. Additionally, the article \\"Doing Gender\\" by Candace West and Don H. Zimmerman was assigned.  Week Three: Who is producing comic book culture?  Week three dealt with comic books as a medium of communication. The interview included Kelly Sue DeConnick, Sana Ammant and Steve Wacker and their roles as writers and editors. The assigned comics were Captain Marvel #1-7, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 1, Ms. Marvel #1, vol. 2, and Daredevil #1. The article \\"How Comic Books are Made from Idea to Print\\" was the supplemental reading.  Week Four: Femininity  Week four discussed femininity, and the readings included Secret Six (vol. 2) 1-7, Wonder Woman #1, Wonder Woman (New 52) #7, Birds of Prey #56, and Batgirl #0. The interview was with Gail Simone. (Due to technical difficulties, this was a recorded interview, not live as the others were.) The article \\"Spice World: Constructing Femininity the Popular Way\\" by Dafna Lemishhttp://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/syllabi/spring%202005/com%20507/spicegirls.pdf was also assigned.  Week Five: Masculinity  Week five discussed masculinity, and the comics assigned were both from the New 52: Batman #0 and Swamp Thing #0. The interview was with Scott Snyder. Additional reading was \\"Comic Book Masculinity and the New Black Superhero\\" by Jeffrey A. Brownhttp://lmc.gatech.edu/~hcarroll/courses/e1102-sp04/e1102-scans/secondary- sources/brown.pdf  Week Six: Gendered Spaces and Consuming Comics  The final week discussed how different spaces can be gendered, and differences in how comics are consumed. The readings were from Y: The Last Man (#1-6) and Saga #1, and the interview was with Brian K. Vaughan. The article \\"Gendered Spaces: Gym Culture and the Construction of Gender\\" by Thomas Johansson was also assigned. The student interaction in the message boards added to the discussions. Since the students were not in a classroom, this was the way they could share ideas and questions, and challenge others to see things from another point of view. Because the class was also global, the students brought with them their own cultural differences, which also added to the discussions. References  External links and further reading  * Robert Annis.

A descendant of Confucius, he wrote the Shangshu Kongshi Zhuan, a compilation and commentary of the \\"Old Text\\" Shangshu. His work was lost, but a fourth- century forgery was officially recognized as a Confucian classic for over a millennium. Background Kong Anguo was a native of Qufu in Lu, one of the many semi-autonomous kingdoms of the Western Han dynasty. He was the second son of Kong Zhong () and an eleventh-generation descendant of Confucius. He studied the Classic of Poetry and Shangshu (Book of Documents) from the famous Confucian scholars Shen Pei and Fu Sheng. Kong also served in the court of Emperor Wu of Han as the Grand Master of Remonstrance (). Old Text Shangshu According to tradition, the local ruler Prince Gong of Lu demolished a building of the Kong family complex in the process of enlarging his palace, and some ancient texts were discovered hidden in a wall, including Shangshu. They had apparently been hidden there in order to escape the book burning of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. This version of Shangshu contained 16 more chapters than the one transmitted by Fu Sheng. As the hidden texts were written in the ancient seal script, this newly discovered version is called \\"Ancient Script\\" or \\"Old Text\\" Shangshu, whereas Fu Sheng's version is called the \\"Modern Script\\" or \\"New Text\\". Kong Anguo compiled and wrote a commentary to the Old Text called Shangshu Kongshi Zhuan (Â∞öÊõ∏Â≠îÊ∞èÂÇ≥, literally Kong's Commentary of Shangshu), and the famous historian Sima Qian studied the text from him. The documents had a foreword added by Kong. However, the Shangshu Kongshi Zhuan was later lost during the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 AD). In the early fourth century, during the Eastern Jin dynasty, a purported copy of Kong's work suddenly reemerged. Scholar Mei Ze submitted a copy of the Old Text Shangshu to Emperor Yuan of Jin, along with a preface supposedly written by Kong Anguo. The Jin court accepted Mei's version as authentic. In 653, during the Tang dynasty, Mei Ze's Old Text further became the official version of the Confucian classic. Although many scholars had questioned the authenticity of Mei's version over the centuries, it maintained its official status for more than 1000 years until the Qing dynasty. Mei Ze's version is now recognized as a forgery. The \\"ancient character\\" edition falsely attributed to Kong is fake.

It was the last RHA unit to serve in India between December 1945 and April 1947, before being redesignated as 6th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery in Palestine in 1948. The regiment had an earlier incarnation as F Brigade, RHA, formed from the 2nd Brigade of the Bengal Horse Artillery in 1862 before being broken up in 1877. It was reestablished in 1901 as VI Brigade, RHA but was broken up at the outbreak of World War I as its constituent batteries were posted to other formations. History  F Brigade, RHA The Bengal Army of the Honourable East India Company formed its first battery of Horse Artillery, the Experimental Brigade, Bengal Horse Artillery on 4 December 1800 (still in existence as F Battery, RHA). By the time the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out, the Bengal Horse Artillery had grown to 13 batteries, organized as three brigades. Four of these batteries were manned by sepoys (native Indian soldiers) and two mutinied: 4th Troop, 1st Brigade at Neemuch and 4th Troop, 3rd Brigade at Multan. All four batteries were promptly reformed as European units. As a result of the Rebellion, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bengal Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Artillery as its 2nd and 5th Horse Brigades. On transfer, 5th Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery comprised: *A Battery, 5th Horse Brigade (A/5) - formerly 1st Troop, 2nd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery at Rawalpindi *B Battery, 5th Horse Brigade (B/5) - formerly 2nd Troop, 2nd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery at Meerut *C Battery, 5th Horse Brigade (C/5) - formerly 3rd Troop, 2nd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery at Ambala *D Battery, 5th Horse Brigade (D/5) - formerly 4th Troop, 2nd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery at Mian Mir *E Battery, 5th Horse Brigade (E/5) - formerly 3rd Troop, 3rd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery at Mian Mir *F Battery, 5th Horse Brigade (F/5) - formerly 4th Troop, 3rd Brigade Bengal Horse Artillery at Ambala The 1st Brigade with 10 batteries was much larger than the other four (with four to seven batteries each). A reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades, 2nd Brigade become C Brigade, 3rd become D Brigade, 4th become E Brigade, and 5th become F Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the batteries were also redesignated. The new designations were in order of seniority. F Horse Brigade, RA now comprised: *A Battery, F Horse Brigade (A/F) - formerly A/5 Battery at Ambala *B Battery, F Horse Brigade (B/F) - formerly B/5 Battery at Peshawar *C Battery, F Horse Brigade (C/F) - formerly C/5 Battery at Ambala *D Battery, F Horse Brigade (D/F) - formerly E/5 Battery at Peshawar *E Battery, F Horse Brigade (E/F) - formerly D/5 Battery at Mian Mir *F Battery, F Horse Brigade (F/F) - formerly F/5 Battery at Sialkot From 1866, the term \\"Royal Horse Artillery\\" appeared in Army List hence the brigade was designated F Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time. Another reorganization on 14 April 1877 saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each) and F Brigade was broken up. Its batteries were mostly transferred to C Brigade and redesignated again, for example, A/F Battery becoming F Battery, C Brigade. The number of brigades was further reduced to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882. The brigade system was finally abolished in 1889. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation. VI Brigade, RHA =First formation= The brigade system was revived in 1901. Each brigade now commanded just two batteries and a small staff (a Lieutenant-Colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major). Initially, batteries were not assigned to brigades in any particular order, but in 1906, at the insistence of Edward VII, brigades were redesignated so that batteries were roughly in order of seniority (hence I Brigade commanded A Battery and B Battery). VI Brigade, RHA was formed on 1 March 1901 as the VII Brigade-Division, RHA with H Battery and K Battery. In 1903 it was redesignated as VII Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Meerut. On 1 October 1906, it was redesignated as VI Brigade, RHA. By the time World War I broke out, the brigade was stationed at Trowbridge attached to 2nd Cavalry Brigade. H Battery was at Trowbridge and on 28 September was assigned to VII Brigade, RHA in 1st Cavalry Division as a permanent replacement for L Battery which had been almost destroyed at N√©ry. K Battery was at Christchurch and on 1 October was assigned to XV (later IV) Brigade, RHA in 3rd Cavalry Division. With the departure of its batteries, the brigade HQ was dissolved. =Second formation= By October 1919, VI Brigade, RHA was reformed at Shorncliffe in the United Kingdom with *V Battery, RHA from 7th Indian Cavalry Brigade in Mesopotamia in May 1919 *W Battery, RHA from 11th Indian Cavalry Brigade in Mesopotamia in May 1919 *X Battery, RHA from XVII Brigade, RHA in Germany in early 1919 This new incarnation was short-lived, however. On 8 January 1920, the Headquarters was absorbed into the HQ of 8th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery. On 4 May 1920, V, W, and X Batteries were converted to 137th, 138th and 139th Batteries, RFA in 8th Brigade, RFA. 6th Regiment, RHA 6th Regiment, RHA was formed on 1 November 1940 at Bulwick, Northamptonshire from a cadre of 5th Regiment, RHA. Initially, it commanded 1, 2 and 3 batteries until they took on the identities of N, O and P batteries. In March 1941, P Battery, RHA left 3rd Regiment, RHA and returned to the UK. In February 1942, O Battery, RHA was unlinked from B/O Battery of 1st Regiment, RHA and returned to the UK. In April 1942, N Battery, RHA was unlinked from I/N Battery of 2nd Regiment, RHA and returned to the UK. The regiment did not see active service in World War II, instead it remained in England as a training formation to provide officers and men to the other regiments. On 4 December 1940 it was assigned to the 9th Support Group of 9th Armoured Division and remained with the division when 9th Support Group was disbanded on 12 June 1942. It remained under command of 9th Armoured Division until 10 July 1944. 9th Armoured Division was disbanded shortly thereafter. In December 1945 the regiment was posted to India, the last RHA unit to serve there. On 29 April 1947, the regiment departed Bombay (Mumbai) for Port Said, Egypt arriving on 8 May. It was posted to the Canal Zone, serving there until October, before moving to Palestine on internal security duties. In 1948, 6th Regiment RHA reverted to RA status as 6th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery. N Battery transferred to 4th Regiment, RHA just before conversion, with W Battery, RHA replacing it.

He was one of the best three-year-olds in Europe in 1976 when he won the classic St Leger Stakes and finished second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He went on to win the Coronation Cup as a five-year-old in 1978. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in the United States and Australia with limited success. Background Crow was a chestnut horse with a white blaze standing 16 hands high bred by his owner Daniel Wildenstein. He was the best horse sired by the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Exbury, to whom he bore a close physical resemblance. His dam, Carmosina was an Argentinian mare bought by Wildenstein for $10,000. The colt was sent into training in France with Angel Penna. Crow usually raced in a sheepskin noseband. Racing career 1976: three-year-old season Crow did not race as a two-year-old but began his racing career in the spring of 1976. He won the Prix Northeast, finished second to Hunza Dancer in the Grand Prix de Compi√®gne and then won the Prix Eug√®ne Adam over 2000 metres at Saint- Cloud Racecourse. In August, Crow was sent to England, where he finished second to Wollow in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup. In September he returned to Britain for the 200th running of the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Yves Saint-Martin he started the 6/1 co-favourite alongside Oats and General Ironside. Crow took the lead early in the straight and won the classic by two lengths from Secret Man and Scallywag. In October, Crow was one of twenty horses to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2,400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Crow took a clear lead in the straight but was overtaken 100 metres from the finish and finished second to Ivanjica. The beaten horses included Pawneese, Bruni and Youth. On his final appearance of the season he failed to reproduce his best form as he finished unplaced behind Vitiges in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. 1977-1978: later career Crow did not record any major successes in 1977. He did, however, finish a close fifth behind Alleged in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and ran third to Johnny D. in the Turf Classic. At five Crow was trained in England by Peter Walwyn. He finished second to Rex Magna in the Prix d'H√©douville and won the Ormonde Stakes at Chester. In June he appeared at Epsom Downs Racecourse for the Coronation Cup. He started at odds of 9/4 and won from the New Zealand-bred champion Balmerino. Assessment Crow was awarded a rating of 134 by Timeform in 1976, making him the second best three-year-old colt in Europe, one pound behind Youth. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average Group One winner. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Crow an \\"average\\" St Leger winner. Stud career Crow was retired to stud in 1979. He stood as a breeding stallion in Kentucky before being exported to Australia in 1986. He sired many winners, but few were of any consequence. Crow died in Australia on 10 February 1989.

Ame-no-tajikarao is written as Â§©ÊâãÂäõÁî∑Á•û in Kojiki, and Â§©ÊâãÂäõÈõÑÁ•û in Nihon Shoki.  Mythological description  At the event of Amano-Iwato, Ame-no-tajikarao waited at the caves' door to pull out (in the Nihon Shoki and the Kogo Sh≈´i, 'to pull open') Amaterasu (Â§©ÁÖß) from the cave, and thus return light to the world. During the Tenson k≈çrin, Amaterasu had Omoikane, Ame-no-tajikarao, and Ama-no-iwato-wake- no-kami accompany the Imperial Regalia of Japan when it went to the Ise province to be enshrined at Ise Grand Shrine.  Explanation  The name Ame- no-tajikarao carries the connotation of a male god with extreme and surmounting physical brute strength.  Religious Belief  Ame-no-tajikaro is believed to be a god of sports and physical power, and is enshrined at shrines associated with Ise Grand Shrine such as Togakushi Shrine (Êà∏Èö†Á•ûÁ§æ), Sano Shrine (‰ΩêÈÇ£Á•ûÁ§æ), Shiroi Shrine (ÁôΩ‰∫ïÁ•ûÁ§æ), Oyama Shrine (ÈõÑÂ±±Á•ûÁ§æ), Tejikarao Shrine (ÊâãÂäõÈõÑÁ•ûÁ§æ) (Gifu), Tejikarao Shrine (ÊâãÂäõÈõÑÁ•ûÁ§æ) (Kakamigahara), Toake Shrine (Êà∏ÊòéÁ•ûÁ§æ), and Ame- no-ta-nagao Shrine (Â§©ÊâãÈï∑Áî∑Á•ûÁ§æ). His own Shinto priests think he was originally a protector of agriculture (maybe because he brought back sun light to the world, or maybe because peasants need fitness to work in the fields). Strangely, this god is often in association with Sugawara no Michizane, as the god Tenjin. At the Togakushi Shrine there's a legend that says that the cave door that Ame-no-tajikarao threw away landed on Togakushi mountain (Êà∏Èö†Â±±) in Shinano Province (‰ø°ÊøÉÂõΩ).

It falls within the Baringo County (part of the former Rift Valley Province) in north central Kenya. The occupied area is situated on the floodplain of the River Ndau's confluence with the Sekutionnen River, on a widespread terrace called the Low Terrace, the top of which is about 3m above the level of the modern river. The site was initially discovered by Louis Leakey in 1969. It was visible as a large exposure of bones, stone tools and pottery eroding out of the terrace. The site was excavated in the late 1970s as part of Francoise Hivernel's PhD research. Ngenyn remains the only Late Holocene site excavated in the Lake Baringo Basin and in general very little archaeological work has been done on the Late Holocene within the Baringo County. Excavations The surface exposure spread over 2ha but the eastern part of the site was completely disturbed by cattle trampling and agriculture. Hivernel dug 13 test trenches, 8 of which proved sterile. Extensive excavations followed revealing three occupation phases. Occupation 1 Occupation 1 was not dated, but it is presumed to be the oldest occupation phase. Found were basalt stone tools, 3 distinctive pottery decorations, including possibly the earliest record of the Turkwel Culture, and faunal remains of ovicaprids and wild game. Occupation 2 It is speculated that Occupation 2 was a butchering site or an activity area, however no further work was done to confirm this. The occupation phase was dated to 2020¬±230 BP and contained stone tools, undecorated pottery, and the remains of ovicaprids, cattle, wild game, fish and rodents. Occupation 2 also contained a knapping area. Occupation 3 Occupation 3 was by far the richest occupation layer. It contained pottery with 5 different types of decoration, which may fit with Akira, Remnant, and Narosura pottery wares from the Pastoral Neolithic period. It also contained some 5000 lithic objects from basalt and obsidian, and remains of cattle, ovicaprids, wild game, and fish. The remains of fish species indicate that the site was also occupied from Nov-Dec and Mar-Apr, which falls within the two rainy seasons the area experiences. Spatial analysis indicated that the area was possibly a 'home base', however, further investigation is needed before this is confirmed. The occupation layer also contained certain features. Occupation 3 was dated to 1970¬±150 BP and 2080¬±110 BP. These dates however need to be re-calibrated. Current state of the site Since the 1970s no further research has been done on the archaeology of the Late Holocene in the Baringo District. The area of the archaeological site is currently extensively cultivated and subject to slash-and-burn agriculture. Furthermore, because of the loose silty clay loams the area is eroding quickly and the archaeology is in danger of being lost. The Ndau river is also cutting deeper into its bank washing away the archaeological material. The excavations at Ngenyn were not extensive, and because of the lack of archaeological work, it is hard to situate it within the wider archaeological context of the Rift Valley and Kenya. More archaeological research into the Late Holocene will be done by the Resilience in East African Landscapes Initial Training Network in the following years.

It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election. Summary The election saw the Conservatives maintain overall control of the council with a majority of 4 seats, a reduction of 1 seat. The Liberal Democrat group retained their status as the council's official opposition despite being reduced to 12 seats, down 4 seats. The Labour Party were the biggest winners, making their debut appearance in county hall with 5 seats. It was also the first time a UKIP candidate had been elected to the council. The council's only independent councillor lost his seat. No other parties achieved electoral representation on the council, though the Green Party did contest the election in a number of divisions.

The partnership ended the same year. Pelz has been attributed the main role in the general design of the building and the execution of its exterior, while Smithmeyer was instrumental in securing the commission. In 1906 Smithmeyer published a History of the Construction of the Library of Congress (1906)History of the Construction of the Library of Congress (1906), in which he defended his role in the project. In the early 1890s Smithmeyer worked on the construction of the Chamberlain Hotel in Fort Monroe, Virginia, a commission he had won together with Pelz before their separation.

() is one of the most prestigious schools in Uruguay. It was established in 1857 for the children of German traders, artists, engineers and diplomats living in Montevideo. Since the second half of the 20th century, this school is located in the neighborhood of Pocitos. And since the end of the century, it has another location at Barra de Carrasco, on Av. Giannattasio (east of Carrasco). The school is also well known for having the best handball team in the country, having won most of the national tournaments. Organization and administration The school is directed by Christofer Lahser, acting as general headmaster. The specific secondary school and primary school directors are Juan Carlos Noya and Stephanie Achatz, respectively. Bicultural Baccalaureate One of the most notable characteristics of the school, is the availability of a German Abitur-based high school diploma program, with most lessons taught in German. It is accepted by both Germany and Uruguay universities as a valid high school certificate. It is a trilingual, bicultural baccalaureate, teaching German, Spanish, and English classes, and teaching culture (Geography, history, traditions, etc.) of both Germany and Uruguay. It is considered more challenging than the standard program, and admission to it is dependent on grades and language skills. Student Exchange Program The student exchange program takes place every year in 4¬∫ Liceo (Tenth grade). Students must pay the two-month trip by themselves, as the school offers little to no trip scholarships. The destination is several cities in Germany, such as Munich, Berlin, Frankfurt and Hamburg for two weeks, after which each student is sent to live with its exchange family, separated from most others in a preset small village or major city. After those two months, they come back and house the same German student who they stayed with. Quota availability is varied and based on the number of people that confirmed being able to offer a house for people to stay there. The financial aspect is not the only determining factor, as students are required to have a high academical and behavioral standard by the end of the year, or else risk getting banned from the trip. Student Council Two student-elected representatives are chosen by classroom. The objective is for them to act as a link between the Student Parliament and the students, should any particular issue arise, and maintain them in constant knowledge, always putting the child's best interests in mind. Another one per grade form the permanent council of the Student Parliament which acts as the central governing body and as a link between the school, the parents and the direction. Meetings are formed monthly to discuss themes ranging from entertainment, sports and arts to infrastructure, technology and well-being. This is later managed by the heads of each sub-council and the Presidents of the Parliament, and passed on to the headmaster and staff if required. The direction of the school is responsive and actively cooperates with the council's feedback. The Student Parliament is directed by the students Juan Ignacio Dupetit and Mar√≠a Bel√©n Men√©ndez.

Nearby, Solomon‚Äôs Ford, which was once an important crossing over the Maribyrnong River, also bears his name.https://shawfactor.com/gazetteer/victoria/avondale-heights/ Solomon Heights is significant for its lack of development compared with adjacent suburbs, despite being subdivided into 435 lots during the 1920s. , the area lacked sealed roads, drainage and power. Numerous reasons are cited for the lack of development activity in the Solomon Heights area, in particular, its status as a significant local grassland, as well as various infrastructure constraints.  Site history  The site consists of 435 lots with 135 land-owners. It was originally zoned for industrial use and development, but development interest was quickly lost due to a number of factors. In particular, the lot sizes were not appropriate for most industrial use, whereas those in the adjacent Sunshine North industrial estate were larger.Partially excavated quarry Despite its proximity to the Western Ring Road, traffic movement in the area is limited by the Albion‚ÄìJacana railway line, resulting in the congestion of local connecting roads and access points. That has rendered Solomon Heights an undesirable location for an industrial precinct. Many landowners chose to retain their properties, continuing to pay municipal charges, as well as water rates, despite their lots not being serviced. The geology of the site led to quarry development in the 1970s, with three full-scale quarries and one partial quarry dug for the excavation of rock fragments for gravel.http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/planning/planningschemes/get- information/historical-planning-information/planning-scheme-history- index/Brimbank?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZzMy5kcGNkLnZpYy5nb3YuYXUlMkZwbGFubmluZ19zY2hlbWVfaGlzdG9yeSUyRmIwMzlmODNhNmNkYjg2NTZmM2FhNDM4MmIxNzNiZGVmLnBkZiZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D  Present day  The site has recently been identified as an important \\"strategic site\\" within the municipality of Brimbank. It also contains a large number of disused quarries.  Biodiversity  The site includes 14.4 hectares which are considered to be of \\"state and national significance\\" due to the presence of several endangered plant species, escarpment scrubland, and a river red gum woodland bioregion.http://sunshine.starcommunity.com.au/star/2008-05-01/rare- grasslands-at-risk/ The area is considered one of the most threatened in the state by housing development.http://sunshine.starcommunity.com.au/star/2008-05-01/rare- grasslands-at-risk/ Grasslands looking towards Melbourne Native grasslands, towards Tullamarine Airport The site contains 75 specimens of the endangered pimelea spinescens, 2% of the remaining population, and is 0.6-0.8% of all remaining basalt plains grassland. The significance of this has resulted in much discourse on the future of the site, such as the suggestion of establishing a Western Grassland Reserve to protect native flora and fauna from inappropriate development.http://www.gaa.vic.gov.au/wp- content/Assets/Files/Melton%20-%20sub3276.docx The City of Brimbank is seeking to preserve and enhance biodiversity with an environmental significance overlay, alongside the introduction of a Natural Heritage Policy in Clause 22.06 of the Brimbank Planning Scheme. However, this lies at odds with separate municipal policy decreeing the location an \\"important strategic site\\" with potential for mixed use development. Illegal rubbish dumping Unlawful industrial land use, potentially damaging significant basalt plains grassland The site is envisioned as an attempt at whole-Council \\"place based\\" design, planning and management, with development as a residential or industrial estate with native grassland offset a distinct possibility. Due to the lack of development and isolation, the site is at high risk for vandalism, trail bike riders and illegal dumping, all of which negatively impact the sensitive grasslands - recently, there has been illegal industrial use on the land, potentially damaging fragile native flora.  Infrastructure  Another constraint for development in the precinct is the Albion-Jacana freight railway line. The line borders the western boundary of Solomon Heights, rendering Bunnett St the only access point to the site, because a bridge is required to allow for unobstructed rail operations. This is further complicated by the presence of the Somerton Pipeline, which runs alongside the Albion-Jacana railway line.http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11335280-s2565.htm This pipeline carries 85% of the fuel utilised at Tullamarine Airport, from the Altona Mobil refinery to storage in Somerton. Corner of Bunnett St and Munro Ave, the only roadway which enters into Solomon Heights The pipeline was constructed in the 1970s by Vic Rail, long after the subdivision of Solomon Heights.http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11335280-s2565.htmhttp://www.railgeelong.com/article/vicrail- pipelines Its presence means that a development plan, inclusive of any work or construction on the site such as road infrastructure or alterations to the railway, requires a permit under Schedule 11 of to the Development Plan Overlay.http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/planning/planningschemes/get- information/historical-planning-information/planning-scheme-history- index/Maribyrnong?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZzMy5kcGNkLnZpYy5nb3YuYXUlMkZwbGFubmluZ19zY2hlbWVfaGlzdG9yeSUyRjhhYjMxMzg3OWYwNjk3NTRkOWRkM2M4MmU4ZGU5ZGYwLnBkZiZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D That particularly concerns infrastructure works such as the proposed Melbourne Airport rail link, which could render the site more feasible for future development.http://www.dpcd.vic.gov.au/planning/planningschemes/get- information/historical-planning-information/planning-scheme-history- index/Maribyrnong?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZzMy5kcGNkLnZpYy5nb3YuYXUlMkZwbGFubmluZ19zY2hlbWVfaGlzdG9yeSUyRjhhYjMxMzg3OWYwNjk3NTRkOWRkM2M4MmU4ZGU5ZGYwLnBkZiZhbGw9MQ%3D%3D  Future development  Current landowners are concerned about devaluation of their properties resulting from these development constraints. The future of a mixed-use estate on the Solomon Heights site is still unclear. Environmental planning controls for the site must be resolved in the interests of protecting native grasslands, allowing for the control of environmental threats in view of future development.http://sunshine.starcommunity.com.au/star/2008-05-01/rare- grasslands-at-risk/ The site requires a design and planning response which overcomes constraints placed on it by its location, and adequately meets the needs of present land-owners and future municipality growth, whilst protecting the fragile grasslands which typify it.

Archaeological reconstruction of the area  A.M. ColiniA.M. Colini, in: A. Munoz (Hrsg.), Campidoglio, 1930, p. 46. and J.E. PackerJ.E. Packer, La casa di Via Giulio Romano, BCom 81, 1968/69, pp. 129 ff. assumed that the building, today known as the Insula dell'Ara Coeli, was the still preserved part of a multi-storey, four-wing building, that once grouped around an inner courtyard. Analyzing the archeological evidence S. Priester showed, that the south wing, hypothetically assumed by previous researchers, cannot be proven; he proposed a new reconstruction of the entire area: S. Priester differentiated and described the \\"west building\\", which today, with the exception of its massive brick facade, is almost entirely covered by the modern Via del Teatro di Marcello. The size of this ground floor with its row of shops (tabernae) was up to 400 square meters.Priester: Ad summas tegulas (2002), pp. 91 f. In the north of the site stood the \\"north building\\" with its ancient staircase, which was filled up again immediately after the excavation.Priester: Ad summas tegulas (2002) p. 92. The \\"east building\\", now known as Insula dell'Ara Coeli, is the most visible part of this building ensemble today. Instead of an open courtyard, S. Priester reconstructed an alley covered with arches between the \\"West Building\\" and \\"East Building\\". The portico pillars of the \\"east building\\" and the traces of arches as well as corresponding brick pillars of the opposite \\"west building\\" served as evidence. Following this reconstruction, the vaulted path (via tecta) as an alley (vicus) coming from the west turned south at the \\"north building\\" and then ran between the differently tall buildings of the \\"west building\\" and \\"east building\\". At least one branch of the path may also have led to the southern facade of the \\"East Building\\". By adding the portico to the \\"east building\\", the width of the street was reduced to about 3.8 meters; the alley was paved safely in a secondary phase and was finally abandoned as a traffic route in late antiquity.Priester: Ad summas tegulas (2002), pp. 92 ff.  The floors of the multi-storey apartment building  Four floors remain. The ground floor consisted of shops that faced the surrounding streets, with the owners using ladders to access living quarters immediately above. A mezzanine lay above the shop level. The two remaining floors seem to have been designed for human residence. The third floor seemed to be large, spacious apartments. The fourth floor had a corridor with a series of three room suites leading off of it. Archaeologist Andrew Wallace-Hadrill suggested that with a little imagination, these suites are comparable to apartments in which many 21st century Roman families live. Archaeologists believe the structure was originally built with at least five stories. It has been evaluated that the insula romana could host around 380 people.

The pioneer mission was established by the Holy Ghost Fathers. The original Holy Ghost Church, built in 1872, is reportedly the oldest church on the mainland of East Africa, while the new church was built 1910-1914. In 1874, David Livingstone was interred for a night at the Holy Ghost Mission; the Livingstone Tower, a part of the original church, is named in his honor. There are several other buildings on the mission grounds, including the Old Fathers' House, which was the residence for the missionaries. The three-storey building features a wide balcony and is built in pre-colonial mission style. The grounds also include a cemetery, a grotto (built in 1876), and a museum. The Missionay complex is located to the north of the Bagamoyo town. History In 1868, Father Antoine Horner of the Holy Ghost Fathers who was looking for a location in the main land of East Africa to establish the first Roman Catholic mission came to Bagamoyo and decided to establish the mission here. At that time itself it was cosmopolitan town with its local ethnic groups and also people from Arabia, India, Muslim countries, Parsees, Goa and Europe. It was a trade centre and was well known for its slave trade. The land required for the mission was gifted by Muslims under the leadership of Sultan Majid in 1868 itself. Soon thereafter, the first church was built in 1872, after establishing the mission, as a simple towered structure of French design but with local materials. With its many arches and pinnacles, the tower resembles a mitre. This \\"squat tower\\" has since been renamed as Livingston tower. Father's residence (a triple storied building with wide balcony) was also built at the time in the local style with mangrove wood floor and roof, and coral stone walls of a precolonial style of architecture. It has open arches on its periphery and has no resemblance to the German colonial architecture. The Sisters' Convent was also built in the same style. During this time cholera epidemic had also affected the town and people took refuge in the mission complex. The objective of the French Missionaries, who founded the mission here, was to free slaves from their bonded labour, which though initially had limited success but generated awareness to further the cause of an Awareness Movement of the east African Slave Trade. In 1892, another large gift of land of was made to the mission by Sewa Haji, the Muslim philanthropist and a very rich trader (who traded in cloth, copper, gunpowder, ivory and rhino horn and who also owned and arranged caravans). This enabled the mission to enlarge its building complex. In 1910-14, before World War I, a bigger Romanesque church, named the New Holy Ghost Church, was built with dressed coral stone blocks. A cemetery was also established about away from the main mission building where early missionaries are buried. A grotto was built by the \\"emancipated slaves\\" who lived in the mission. There are also some exotic trees in the grounds of the mission which were planted early during the missionaries began their mission. Museum The Sisters‚Äô House, built in 1876, was converted into the Roman Catholic Mission Museum. The museum has many sentimentally touching exhibits of photographs of slaves tied together with chains to their necks, exhibits of the history of Missionary work and conversion to Christianity, books and booklets on prehistory of Bagamoyo, Indian and Arab door frames, and shackles, chains and whips used during slave trade, and many local wood crafts. Other notable features Livingstone Tower of the old church. The Catholic mission building. When David Livingstone the legendary explorer died during the exploration campaign, his dead body was carried by his devoted servants, Abdullak Susi and James Chuma. They carried his emaciated body (without the heart which had been buried in Zambia) on a journey from Chitamaho in Zambia to Bagmayo which lasted over a period of 11 months. His body was kept in the tower (which is named after him now) on 24 February 1874 for one night and the next day it was taken on the ship ironically named MS Vulture to Zanzibar and then to England where he was buried in Westminster Abbey. 700 slave gathered to pay homage to him at the church before the \\"Mwili wa Daudi\\" - \\"the Body of David\\" was taken to England. An object of note attached to the Boab tree in the churchyard is a small piece of iron chain. It is said that a young French Missionary, Madam Chevalier, who was running a dispensary in Zanzibar, had fastened a chain to the tree to tie her donkey, and eventually forgot about it. Over the centuries the tree has grown to an enormous size of diameter leaving out the chain as a small piece of of the chain.

Upon arriving at his mom's house, he got an acoustic guitar and worked the song out.

New Found Glory guitarist Chad Gilbert, who produced Homesick, was shown a demo of the song. The band immediately told him that it would be the album's opening track. Gilbert said: \\"in my opinion, first songs are often the first thing people hear, so it should almost encompass the whole record.

The building, located at 1483-1485 8th St., was built in 1877 as a store and residence. The building was designed in the Italianate style and features projecting bays at its northwest and southwest corners, a bracketed cornice, a frieze with dentils and crown moldings, and a hipped roof. . Local 188 of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, the African- American fraternal organization founded by Marcus Garvey, purchased the building for its headquarters in 1925. Founded in 1920, Local 188 was the largest chapter of the UNIA in northern California. The chapter renamed the building Liberty Hall, the name used by all of the UNIA's meeting halls. During its time in the building, the UNIA used it for its meetings, activities, and holidays such as Lincoln's Birthday and Garvey Day. A fire burnt the building's roof in 1931, and the UNIA's activism in Oakland declined afterward. The organization sold the building in 1933. After the UNIA left the building, one of Oakland's chapters of the International Peace Mission movement took over the building. The International Peace Mission was a religious movement led by Father Divine, an African-American preacher from New York. Father Divine, who was considered the Second Coming by his followers, was known for hosting free banquets at his home during the Great Depression. The International Peace Mission continued to operate in the building until the 1950s, though its activities declined after the early 1940s. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 30, 1989.

Walton was born in New York City on October 8, 1768, the son of Jacob and Mary (Cruger) Walton. The Waltons were a prominent New York City family. Educated in England, Walton returned to New York in about 1788 and studied law under Aaron Burr. In 1790 he moved to Ballston, New York. There he served as surrogate court judge, where he was known as Judge Henry Walton. In 1815 he built a mansion called Pine Grove on Broadway in Saratoga Springs, New York, across from the present City Center. This property was sold in 1823 to Chancellor Reuben Hyde Walworth and was later inherited by Walworth's daughter-in-law Ellen Hardin Walworth. In 1816, Walton built the estate he called \\"Wood Lawn,\\" which he sold to Henry Hilton. Walton was a large land owner in the area, and donated land for the First Presbyterian Church, the Universalist Church, and the Methodist Church in Saratoga Springs. In 1819 he built the Pavilion Hotel on Broadway, on the site of the present City Hall. The hotel burned down around 1840 and was not rebuilt. He was also involved in developing the famous springs of Saratoga, tubing the Flat Rock Spring, and the President, later called the Iodine and the Saratoga Star Spring. Matilda Caroline Cruger Yates Walton He was married first to Pernette Sara de Maffe, who died in 1798. In 1800 he married Mrs. Matilda (or Mathilda) (Cruger) Yates (1776‚Äì-1812), by whom he had Jacob, Mary, Henry (1806‚Äì1865), Jared, Cruger, Mathilda, and William Henry. His son Henry later became a well-known artist in Ithaca, New York. Walton's third wife was Mrs. Margaret Kearney (1787‚Äì1853), by whom he had Susan, Jared, and Susan K. Henry Walton died in New York City on September 15, 1844, and is buried in the Trinity churchyard.

This album marked the band's return, after eight years of hiatus, in the form of a duo of Brad Laner and Shannon Lee. Background The album was Medicine's first record in eight years, and their first album since the group's split. The album also marks the group's re-introduction of a female vocalist: singer and actress Shannon Lee, daughter of karate actor Bruce Lee. The Mechanical Forces of Love is Lee's first appearance with the group; previously, vocals were provided by Beth Thompson. Unlike previous Medicine albums, guitarist and keyboardist Brad Laner also contributes vocals to the album. Style The album's genre has been classified as dream pop, indie electronic, and shoegaze. Laner described the album's style as \\"Glitchy Beach Boys harmonies.\\" The album was perceived by some as a departure from the group's previous shoegazing sound, but others felt that the album was a \\"synergy\\" of Medicine's earlier style with that of Laner's side-project, Electric Company. An album review by Uncut described the album's style as a \\"collision of Beach Boys/West Coast harmonies with beats‚Äôn‚Äôglitches electronica and mangled sci-fi noise.\\" The album's themes are love and sex. Opening track \\"As You Do\\" was described as \\"shambolic electro- funk\\" by Maya Singer (writing for CMJ New Music Monthly), while Pitchfork deemed the song \\"psychedelic short-circuit funk\\" and likened its style to Sly Stone. Tim Sendra, writing for AllMusic, described Lee's vocals on the song as \\"almost funky.\\" Many of the album's songs were (uncharacteristically for the band) guitar-less, with \\"Good for Me\\" and \\"Whiz\\" being singled out as two of the only songs to feature the instrument prominently. Pitchfork posited that the album, despite its techno influence, should be considered \\"a psychedelic record at heart.\\" AllMusic compared the album's overall style to Garbage. Both AllMusic and Uncut likened the vocal harmonies to those of the Beach Boys. Release The album was released on July 15, 2003. Some editions were released on the record label Wall of Sound, while others were released by Astralwerks. The single \\"I Smile to My Eyes\\" was included on the compilation accompanying the August 2003 issue of CMJ New Music Monthly. To promote the album, it was given to non-commercial modern rock radio stations, with the focus tracks singled out as \\"I Smile to My Eyes,\\" \\"As You Do,\\" \\"Astral Gravy,\\" and \\"Wet on Wet.\\" Critical reception Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from critics, holding a score of 70/100 on review aggregate site Album of the Year. In a review for Pitchfork, critic Nitsuh Abebe commended the album's \\"gorgeous movements,\\" singling out \\"As You Do\\" as a \\"wow-inducing rush\\" and concluding that \\"For some it might burn off quickly, but for just as many it'll sit just fine.\\" Track listing  Personnel  ;Medicine *Brad Laner ‚Äì vocals, instruments, production, engineering, mixing *Shannon Lee ‚Äì vocals ;Production and additional personnel *Jonathan de Villiers ‚Äì photography *Matt Devine ‚Äì additional vocals *Kid606 ‚Äì drum machine *Josh Laner ‚Äì drums *Joey Waronker ‚Äì drums  References   External links  * Category:2003 albums Category:Medicine (band) albums Category:Wall of Sound (record label) albums ","title":"The Mechanical Forces of Love"},{"id":"39429956","title":"Count Arthur Strong (TV series)"},{"id":"39429965","text":"Ode Ogede (often O.

San Romani placed 4th in the 1500 meters at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and set a world record at 2000 meters the following year. Early life San Romani was born in Frontenac, Kansas, on 17 September 1912. He was run over by a truck at age 8, and his right leg was mangled so badly that doctors considered amputating it; he took up running as a form of rehabilitation. His childhood paralleled that of his future friend and rival Glenn Cunningham, who was also from Kansas and also nearly had a leg amputated at age 8. Athletic career San Romani studied at Emporia State Teachers College, getting his degree in music. It was there that he became one of the world's leading milers. He won the 1935 NCAA Championship mile by inches, edging out North Carolina's Henry Williamson in 4:19.1. He was third behind Cunningham and Gene Venzke at the national championships that year. He repeated as NCAA champion in 1936, winning the 1500 m title in a meeting record 3:53.0. At the national championships in Princeton he finished second to Cunningham but beat Venzke and world record holder Bill Bonthron for the first time. At the Olympic Trials the next week San Romani took the lead on the third lap and held it until Cunningham made his move with 300 meters to go. The two then fought a close battle with Cunningham prevailing by inches. Both were timed in 3:49.9, barely a second outside Bonthron's world record. Venzke was third, and these three were selected for the Olympics in Berlin. At the Olympics San Romani placed second in his heat to qualify for the final. In the final he finished fourth in 3:50.0, missing out to New Zealand's Jack Lovelock (who set a new world record), Cunningham and Italy's defending champion Luigi Beccali. A week later, he was part of a United States relay team (with Chuck Hornbostel, Venzke and Cunningham) that set a new world record of 17:17.2 in the 4 x Mile relay. Finally, in October he scored an upset victory in Princeton, defeating both Lovelock and Cunningham. San Romani never won a national outdoor title, but he did become American indoor champion in 1937, beating an international field including Beccali and Venzke. He ran his personal mile best of 4:07.2 in winning the 1937 Princeton Invitational Mile and stayed in good shape for the rest of the year. In Stockholm on 5 August he ran the mile in 4:08.4 - less than two seconds outside Cunningham's world record - despite halting after 1500 meters under the impression that had been the end of the race. Three weeks later in Helsinki he ran 2000 meters in a world record time of 5:16.8, breaking Henry Jonsson's previous mark of 5:18.4. San Romani's world record lasted for almost five years until Sweden's Gunder H√§gg ran 5:16.4 in July 1942. In the winter of 1938 San Romani suffered from health problems and lost his best shape. While he managed to return as a leading contender and only narrowly lost to Cunningham in the 1938 Princeton mile, he never improved his personal bests again. He placed third at the national championships that year and remained one of America's leading milers until his retirement in 1940. Retirement and later life After retiring from athletics he lived in Portland, Maine for several years, working first as a musical instructor and then at the local shipyard. In 1945 he moved back to Kansas and opened a jewelry store in Wichita. He eventually moved to California to teach music again he taught at Dale Jr High School, and Sycamore Jr. High School, in Anaheim California ; he died in Auberry, California on 7 November 1994. He was posthumously inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. Personal life San Romani married Lena Plumley in 1937. They had five children.

Porto Pisano, also known as Triturrita, was the main seaport of the Republic of Pisa, located on the Ligurian Sea coast close to the mouth of the Arno River. In the 13th century, at its peak, Porto Pisano was one of the most important sea ports in Italy, which rivaled if not surpassed both Genoa and Venice. In the Battle of Meloria in 1284 Porto Pisano was blockaded by the Genoese fleet, and Pisa suffered a heavy defeat, which eventually resulted in its decline. Subsequently, Porto Pisano was controlled by Genoa. On August 28, 1421, the port was sold to Florence which has chosen to use Livorno as its principal seaport, since Porto Pisano suffered from increasing alluvial deposits, and the coastline had moved away from the port. After the 16th century, it ceased entirely to be used. Currently the site of Porto Pisano is occupied by San Piero a Grado, a suburb of Pisa. History Chains from Porto Pisano taken by Republic of Genoa (returned in 1860 to Pisa) In the 12th century, Pisa was one of the most important trading cities of Italy, however, it was located slightly off the coast and badly needed a sea port. Porto Pisano was before the middle of the 12th century merely a landing, and in 1156, works to make a major port started. Between 1154 and 1163, three towers were built to guard Porto Pisano; one more tower was built in the sea to guide the ships. From 1162, the entrance to the port was guarded by a chain hung between two of the towers. In 1174, a large warehouse was constructed. From Porto Pisano, the ships went along the coast to the mouth of the Arno and then upstream to Pisa. This short stretch of the coast was under constant threat by the Genoese and by pirates, and therefore needed to be patrolled by the Pisan fleet. There was also a road running overland between Pisa and Porto Pisano, with two hospitals for sick travelers. Between 1285 and 1290, the port structures were destroyed by the Genoese, but within a few years, they were rebuilt, and the port was used again.

It operated from the 1930s‚Äì1956. There is a variety of activities available at Aldridge airport today, including the Greenacres Model Aero Club.  History  Walsall Council purchased Aldridge Lodge and of its estate in 1930. Work on the airport began in 1932 and in 1937 the council contracted Walker Brothers Ltd of Victoria Ironworks, Walsall, to erect a hangar. A licence to operate was obtained in 1938. In 1938 Amy Johnson gave a glider display to a crowd of around 6,000. On her final approach, her glider's wingtip touched a hedge and the aircraft turned over. She was taken to hospital, but was not seriously injured. Operations were limited by the airfield's size, slope, and wet clay soil, making it unsuitable for larger aircraft. It closed in 1956 and most of the buildings were later demolished. The land is now a public open space, known as Aldridge Airport, and hosts a variety of leisure activities under the auspices of Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council. However, it is still used for occasional helicopter landings, including training exercises by the West Midlands Police helicopter.

The flower has six dark blue tepals each up to 2 centimeters long. The fruit is a capsule which may reach nearly a centimeter in length. Flowering occurs in summer and early fall. The flower itself opens in the afternoon, between 3:30 pm and 6:30 pm, but usually between 4:00 and 6:00 pm. The flowers are pollinated by bees, particularly the females of two species of halictids.Goldblatt, P. and J. C. Manning. The Iris Family: Natural History and Classification. Timber Press. 2008. pg. 250. This plant grows in wet, swampy habitat types. It can be found along marshes and in hammocks and flatwoods amongst saw palmettos and cabbage palms. A local endemic, this plant has been reported from thirteen counties in eastern Florida; it is now thought to be extirpated from Broward County. It is mainly distributed in the St. Johns River drainage. There are several occurrences; one count confirms 23. Some are quite large, and the plant is abundant in a few areas of well- maintained habitat. Threats to its survival are thought to be serious, however, with the degradation and destruction of Florida's wildlands being the main problem. Related threats include the draining and clearing of habitat for residential, commercial, and agricultural development, roadside maintenance, and fire suppression in remaining patches of wildfire-adapted ecosystems. The latter issue is a problem because the plant apparently depends on fire events to clear the landscape every few years; large blooms of the species can still be seen in the seasons following a fire.

Only ethnic Ukrainians could join the party, and only Ukrainians were considered an indigenous ethnic group in Ukraine (Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars in the case of Crimea). The party attracted more radical nationalist members then other parties who also urged for Ukrainian independence.Ukraine as the Ukrainian SSR was part of the Soviet Union since 1920 till Ukraine declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 24 August 1991 (Sources: A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples by Paul Robert Magocsi, University of Toronto Press, 2010, (page 563/564 & 722/723)) A merge with the more moderate Ukrainian Republican Party was rejected by the party in 1991. The party referred to the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine as ‚Äòa useless scrap of paper‚Äô as it stated in December 1991 that there was no independent Ukraine; meanwhile it boycotted the Presidential elections of December 1991. On 23 March 1993 the party received official registration by the Ministry of Justice. Later in 1993 Kandyba left the party to head the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and he also tried to dissolve his former party. Early 1994 writer Roman Koval became chairman of the party which under his leadership radicalised. During the 1994 parliamentary elections the party competed in 11 electoral districts, but none of its candidates made it to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament).

In the episode \\"Guts\\", Andrea thinks of Amy as still such a kid in some way, so Andrea gets her a Mermaid necklace from the shop in Atlanta. Amy's group received a distress call from Andrea's group, and Amy declares that they need to assist them, but Shane objects. In the episode \\"Tell It to the Frogs\\", Andrea's group returns to the camp, and the sisters reunite. Amy is later seen at the quarry doing laundry with Andrea, Jacqui, and Carol, until Carol's husband Ed comes along and picks a fight with Carol. Andrea tries to intervene, and Amy helps pull Carol away from Ed before Shane beats Ed senseless. In the episode \\"Vatos\\", Amy and Andrea go fishing on the lake and share their experiences about fishing with their father, comparing how he raised each of them differently. When they return to the camp, Dale explains how Jim has been digging strange holes on the hillside and they go to confront him. That night, the group enjoys dinner around the campfire, and when Amy excuses herself to go to the RV's bathroom, Amy is bitten by a walker in the opening stages of a walker swarm's attack on the exposed camp. Amy dies in Andrea's arms of blood loss and trauma after all the walkers have been killed. In the episode \\"Wildfire\\", Andrea cradles Amy's body and shoots her in the head after she reanimates. Amy is then buried on the hill, on her birthday. = Season 3 = In the episode \\"Hounded\\", Amy's is the first voice to call Rick; she claims to be in a safe place and promises to call back soon, along with Jim, Jacqui and then Lori, who tells Rick all of them are just in his head.  Development and reception  Variety reported that actress Emma Bell would have a recurring role The Walking Dead as \\"a college student who seeks safety with the remaining survivors after the zombie invasion\\". NJ.com described her character Amy as \\"a well-meaning girly-girl\\". The series premiere \\"Days Gone Bye\\" featured a guest appearance from Bell as Amy, Andrea's younger sister. Bell would later become part of the main cast as a recurring character. The episode \\"Vatos\\" marked the last regular appearance of Emma Bell as Amy, whose character was killed off in the conclusion of the installment. Greg Nicotero, the show's production designer, enacted the walker who bites Amy. Bell stated that Nicotero placed a skin-colored prosthetic around her neck, which consisted of a layer of red viscous liquid and a hose. Once it was bitten into, the prosthetic exploded and resembled a severe flesh wound. Kirkman expressed that it was difficult for him to remove Bell from the cast but was thankful that she understood she would only be limited to a certain number of episodes; he stated: > It's something that's very difficult for me. Because it is lines on paper > when I do it in the comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard > [...] doesn't have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is > dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these > actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two > of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed > that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad > for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I would have liked to have had > her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have > got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the > understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes > and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it > doesn't really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I > had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn't actually there for when she died. > But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about > having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when > you're doing a TV show and it's a little upsetting to have to get rid of > somebody. Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club commented in his review of \\"Vatos\\" that the episode \\"begins with a very likable scene between Andrea and Amy; what starts as a completely banal argument between sisters about what kind of knots their fathers taught them to tie turns into a peril-fraught discussion of what it means to outlive the people you love\\". James Poniewozik of TIME commented on the scene saying that the \\"I-am-going-to-die-in-this-episode\\" conversation \\"drew distinctions between Andrea and Amy as characters, in a show that‚Äîperhaps out of necessity in the compression of a six-episode season‚Äîintroduced its characters in very broad strokes. By raising the painful subject of the sisters' parents‚Äîleft to an unknown fate in Florida‚Äîit reminds us that most or all of these characters are dealing with the knowledge, or suspicion, that most everyone they love is dead or zombiefied.\\" Poniewozik added that the reminiscence in which they realize that their father taught Andrea to catch fish and Amy to throw them back \\"points up that the sisters are two very different people. And it suggests a hard truth about the kind of reality The Walking Dead is set in. It was largely a matter of bad luck that Amy was the one to be killed in this episode, but the implication still seems pretty clear: this is not a catch-and-release kind of world, and the odds are not good for the gentle\\". John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press asserted that Kirkman effectively set up Amy's death at the beginning of the episode, and added that it established a sisterly bond, while HitFix's Alan Sepinwall felt the scene was \\"quite lovely\\". Mark Schultz for Creative Loafing commented that the director \\"doesn't cut us any slack during Amy's death scene, drawing out the shots of Andrea wailing over her dying little sister as long as possible before pulling back to show the shock of the other survivors and, finally, the full extent of the carnage\\". In \\"Wildfire\\", Andrea shoots her deceased sister Amy after she slowly resurrected into a walker. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, made Bell wear contact lenses that were less harsh in appearance, as he wanted an emotional connection to resonate between the characters. Bell admitted that she was perplexed on how to approach the scene. \\"I laid down on the wood chips and just sort of stared at the sky and staring at my sister's face,\\" explained Bell. \\"All of these thoughts and emotions started flooding in, so I was really lucky.\\" Note: Event occurs at time 24:45‚Äì26:56. Robert Kirkman commented on the sequence in which Andrea waited for Amy to return as a zombie: \\"It was honestly one of my favorite scenes of the show so far. Glen Mazzara, who wrote that episode, did an amazing job hyping the tension up. Laurie Holden did a great job and then Emma doing her zombie transformation ‚Äî it was really cool.\\" Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club commented on the opening scene: \\"The scene where Amy reanimates slowly, with dead eyes and hands twitching purposelessly, with nothing left of her but hunger, is a real heartbreaker. Andrea deals with it the only way it can be dealt with, but it's an emotionally powerful moment, a tone-setter that reinforces how things might get better, but they don't get any easier.\\" Frank Darabont, who left the show before season 2, had originally planned for the second-season premiere to include a flashback depicting how Dale met Andrea and Amy. Bell reprises her role as Amy in the third-season episode \\"Hounded\\", as one of the voices that speaks to Rick on the phone.

Although it was assumed to have been the album's lead single, the song \\"Belong to the World\\" was released as the lead single for Kiss Land on July 16, 2013. On June 25, 2013, a month later the music video was released, featuring adult actresses London Keyes, Asphyxia Noir and Bonnie Rotten. It is considered NSFW due to the sexually explicit content, but a censored version was released as well. Background and composition In 2011, The Weeknd released the mixtapes House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence to critical acclaim. The following year, he released the compilation album Trilogy, which contained his earlier projects with three newly recorded tracks. The Weeknd began work on his debut studio album Kiss Land in 2013; he revealed the title and cover artwork on March 17. The song was produced by Silkky Johnson, known for his previous work with ASAP Mob and Lil B, in which the first half of the song is a repurpose of another song he initially produced for Main Attrakionz entitled \\"Nothin' Gonna Change,\\" from the 2011 mixtape 808s & Dark Grapes II. \\"Kiss Land\\" was released to the iTunes Store on May 17, 2013, and lasts for seven minutes and thirty- six seconds, it contains a sample of \\"La Ritournelle\\" by French musician S√©bastien Tellier.

Lauren Nostro from Complex complimented The Weeknd's growth as an artist, noting that he \\"continually refines\\" his \\"defined aesthetic\\", and noted that the track \\"boasts a bridge\\". Global Grind's Brittany Lewis described the song as \\"hypnotic\\", while Carl Williott of Idolator thought that the use of a woman's scream brought a \\"sinister lothario thing to absurd new heights\\". Rob Markman from MTV News felt that \\"Kiss Land\\" shared a similar structure to The Weeknd's previous tracks, but also suggested that the forthcoming release of Kiss Land will reveal \\"a lot more about music's mystery man\\".

Ross in the Darkover series. It was first published by in hardcover by DAW Books in 1996.http://www.mzbworks.com/ Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Trust The book falls in the part of the Darkover timeline that the author called \\"Against the Terrans: The Second Age (after the Comyn)\\". Hastur Lord is an allegory, illustrating the consequences to a religiously pluralistic planet, when a small group of monotheistic fundamentalists tries to impose their will on a larger society that doesn't share their views. In terms of Darkover's timeline, the book takes place ten years after The World Wreckers.Author's note, Hastur Lord, DAW Books, 2011, paperback Plot summary Book One: Regis Dan Lawton, the Terran Legate, sends word to Regis Hastur of a medical emergency in the Terran zone. Regis discovers that Dan's son, Felix, is experiencing symptoms of Threshold Sickness. Dan's wife, Tiphani, is hysterical, regarding Threshold Sickness as a symptom of moral degeneracy, rather than simply an illness experienced by telepaths. Regis learns that Tiphani has taken a keyed starstone away from her son, fearing that it is a pagan object. Regis returns the stone to Felix. Regis asks Linnea Storn, the mother of his only child, to come to Thendara and attend to Felix. Regis also asks her to be his wife, saying she is the only woman he could possibly marry. Linnea, knowing that Regis is romantically committed to Danilo, refuses. Danvan Hastur, the elderly Regent of Darkover, dies. On his deathbed, he tells Regis that he has a brother, whose rights in the Comyn must be ensured. Book Two: Rinaldo Regis learns that his brother, Rinaldo, has for many years been a cristoforo brother in the monastery of St. Valentine of the Snows at Nevarsin. Rinaldo tells Regis he is emmasca, and this is why their grandfather never had him legitimated. On the journey to Thendara, Rinaldo displays a tendency to lecture and scold, that both Regis and Danilo find disturbing. Rinaldo meets Tiphani Lawton, and finds a kindred spirit in the overwrought Terran woman. They determine to build the Chapel of All Worlds to teach a syncretistic version of their similar theological views. Danilo Syrtis-Ardais and Mikhail Lanart-Hastur are kidnapped from Comyn Castle by Valdir Ridenow. Ridenow demands that Regis abdicate in favor of Rinaldo. Threatened with Danilo's death by torture, Regis agrees. Rinaldo demands that Regis give up all contact with Danilo, on the grounds that their relationship is sinful. He also demands that Regis take a wife. Linnea Storn-Lanart agrees to the marriage, both because she truly loves Regis and because she knows lives are at stake. Book Three: Danilo Danilo learns that he is now Rinaldo's paxman, against his will. He is ordered to escort Rinaldo's intended bride, Bettany Ridenow, from Serrais. Bettany and Rinaldo are married a week later in a cristoforo rite. At the reception, Danilo observes Rinaldo's unusually close relationship to Tiphani Lawton. Linnea manages a short, reassuring conversation with Danilo, and then goes into labor. Despite threats of open warfare by Valdir Ridenow, Rinaldo thinks it's more important to impose the cristoforo religion on all of Darkover. Bettany announces that she is pregnant. Tiphani tells Danilo that she has abandoned her husband and now goes by the name Tiphani Luminosa. She is clearly mad. Book Four: Regis Regis learns that Rinaldo has ordered the kidnapping of young Comyn children. They have been sequestered in a school whose purpose is to brainwash them with Rinaldo and Tiphani's version of cristoforo doctrine. Regis confronts Rinaldo about the kidnapped children. Rinaldo agrees to release them, but Regis doubts his sincerity. He searches the Old Town, and seeing Tiphani, follows her. He discovers the missing children in an upstairs dormitory, and while attempting rescue, encounters a spaceforce detachment sent by Lawton to recover his son, Felix. During a confrontation between Comyn factions, Rinaldo's behavior becomes increasingly disordered. Regis restores paxman status to Danilo, and summons his brother to answer charges in the Crystal Chamber. Several days later, in the presence of many of the Comyn, Regis declares his brother unfit to rule. As Rinaldo waivers, Tiphani appears with a blaster. She tries to shoot Regis, but Rinaldo throws himself between the two, taking the full force of the blast. Regis returns Rinaldo's body to be buried at St. Valentine of the Snows.

The movie was released in 2012.  Story  The story is set in the mid 1970s. Freddy Demul is the youngest son of a butcher family. Freddy likes road bicycle racing, but this is forbidden by his parents Agnes and Andr√© due to his fecal incontinence. Agnes is afraid her son will be ridiculed when \\"the problem\\" turns up in public, causing such psychological trauma leading Freddy to make some drastic decisions. Agnes knows some children who did self-harm after they were bullied such as the singer with a tumor who never sang anymore and a painter who cut off his tongue as he stuttered. That's why Freddy might not leave the house, although he sneakily goes out sometimes. A French supermarket \\"Magique\\" opens, not far from the butchery. Freddy's brother Briek joins the \\"Flemish Offensive\\", some youth organization which protests all French influences. To promote the supermarket, the director organizes a road bicycle racing for children. Freddy subscribes secretly. The winner gets a trip to Roubaix to meet Eddy Merckx. Briek and Agnes think they have seen Freddy in the race. This is confirmed when the director visits the butchery as Freddy won the contest. However, although Andr√© is a big fan of Eddy Merckx, he does not allow his son to travel to Roubaix again due to the fecal problem. Andr√© is not impressed with the supermarket. He does not believe in the concept people buy things in a store where meat, clothes and food in cans are sold together. He is wrong and less and less customers visit the butchery. Thanks to his rich sister Marjet he gets an idea: customers can call the butchery for their order. Freddy will deliver the meat with his bicycle. This is however a modest success. Due to too fewer customers and a warm summer the meat gets rotten. Freddie becomes befriended with Marie, the daughter of the owner of Magique. One day, they decide to go on a bicycle trip. His fecal problem turns up. Whilst riding home, he is stopped by the Flemish Offensive who laugh at him when they see he has soiled his pants. This turns out in a fight between Freddy and Briek on the one hand and the Flemish Offensive on the other hand. Due to the incident, Briek cancels his membership. This is not appreciated by the Flemish Offensive and they throw a brick through the shopwindow. Agnes tells another story with an unhappy end. She had a younger brother who killed himself. He was bullied after he got some severe attacks of epilepsy. As the butchery is almost broke, Andr√© meets the director of Magique. He can convince the director \\"meat in plastic\\" is inferior and it is better to open a section with fresh quality meat. Andr√© gets a full-time job with guaranteed salary and a commission. Some days later, Andr√© closes his own shop. The director convinces Andr√© to subscribe Freddy for a talent scout. After the school vacation a sports school starts a department for talented bicycle racers, sponsored by Eddy Merckx. Freddy gets selected but his candidacy is uncertain due to the fecal incontinence. It would be a scandal for the sponsors and the team when this happens in public. The medical advisor of the jury suggests to perform another medical examination. He finds out there is an obstruction in the large intestine which can be cured. At the end the jury allows Freddy to start the course. Some years pass and the movie is set to a live submission of Tour of Flanders. When Freddy Demul is shown, the presenter tells Freddy is a talented man who will be known in history books. Reception The movie was received with mixed feelings by general public. Allez, Eddy! got a score of 6.1/10 on IMDB. Awards The movie won 2 awards during the fifth edition of Skykid.com Coming-of-Age Movie Awards. Actor Jelle Blomaert won in category Best Newcomer.

Weiland stepped down from his position on September 17, 2012 to pursue other opportunities. 2014 Senatorial campaign On May 8, 2013, Weiland announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for the South Dakota's U.S. Senate seat. The seat was being vacated by Democrat Tim Johnson, who announced he would not be seeking reelection in 2014. Both Johnson and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle endorsed Weiland. Weiland's campaign emphasized the need to fight the corrupting influence of \\"big money.\\" Weiland won the Democratic nomination and faced two independent candidates (former Republican State Senator Gordon Howie and former three-term Republican U.S. Senator Larry Pressler), and Republican former Governor Mike Rounds in the general election. Weiland called for opening up Medicare for all Americans, sometimes referred to as a public option; expanding Social Security; fighting the Keystone Pipeline; and adopting a Constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United.

The son of a Korean woman and an African-American serviceman, he was sent to the US to be adopted rather than suffer the prejudice of being a mixed race child in an Asian country. At , his clearance in the high jump, in 2000, ranks tied for 14th greatest high jump differential. He is the personal coach of Will Claye, the first person to win Olympic medals in two jumping events at the same Olympics since 1936. Early years Fischer attended Adolfo Camarillo High School, where was a two sport star also playing basketball. He discovered his ability to jump dunking a basketball in 8th grade. He was the CIF California State Meet champion in the high jump in 1994 after finishing 2nd and 5th the previous years. He also finished second at the National Scholastic Indoor Championships and eventually jumping 7' 4\\" at the Santa Barbara Easter Relays, which was the 2nd best (behind Maurice Crumby in 1983) for a Californian ever, eighth best nationwide. Later that season he won the US Junior Championship and represented the US at the World Junior Championships though not making the final. Fischer was inducted into the Mt. SAC Relays high school Hall of Fame in 2006. College years Fischer continued to the University of Wisconsin, where he achieved All American status. Teams with Fischer as a member placed third in the national championships two years in a row. He made the annual top ten ranking in the US twice, in 7th place both times. Seventh is also the place he achieved in the 2000 Olympic Trials. Later in 2000, he represented the US at the 2000 NACAC Under-25 Championships in Athletics, returning with a silver medal. Coaching career Fischer began his coaching career directly out of Wisconsin, first as an administrative assistant at his alma mater, during which they won the Big Ten Triple Crown twice, finished second at the national cross country championships.

Despite its name, there was no predecessor named Pepper or Pepper I. Its gameplay is similar to the game Amidar by Konami and Stern Electronics. Coleco published Pepper II for its ColecoVision home system. The game plays Gounod's \\"Funeral March of a Marionette\\" when gameplay starts. Gameplay There are four mazes per level in Pepper II. Each maze has exits leading to three other mazes. All four mazes must be filled to advance to the next level. To fill in a maze, the player maneuvers \\"Pepper\\" around different segments of the maze. As Pepper travels, he leaves a \\"zipper\\". Once he encloses or \\"zips\\" a segment, it fills in and points are awarded. If Pepper backtracks on an uncompleted segment, it unzips. The character \\"Pepper\\" is an angel. There are two types of enemies that must be avoided: Roaming Eyes and the Whippersnapper (Zipper Ripper on the ColecoVision version) who unzips all uncompleted, zipped segments by moving over them. Pepper's one defense is to enclose an area containing a pitchfork, which turns him into a devil for approximately four seconds. At that time he can go after all Roaming Eyes for points while the Whippersnapper freezes. There are four pitchforks in the corners of every maze. A deluxe energizer is located in the center of each maze. This energizer alternates between being a pitchfork and a halo symbol. If Pepper encloses the middle area when the energizer is a halo, the Whippersnapper disappears from the maze. Points are made for enclosing a segment, consuming a pair of roaming eyes when energized by the pitchfork (similar to Pac-Man), obtaining prizes, completing a maze, and completing 6 mazes. A bonus turn is awarded at 40,000, 50,000, 70,000 or 90,000 points, depending on the dip switch settings. When a full screen (of the six) has been completely filled, \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" is briefly heard. When six full screens are completed, a small cube appears at the bottom of the screen to mark your progress at completing cubes. Each maze also contains a prize in one of the segments. The player must enclose the area it appears in to gain the prize and points, and then the prize is shown beneath the maze. Trivia The original working title of the game was Zipper. The name was hastily changed after a copyright search revealed an unrelated product by the same name.

It extends over the southeast of the historic center of Mexico City and is one of the oldest sections of the city, established over 700 years ago by the Mexica as part of the founding of Tenochtitlan. Over its history the area was associated with commerce, first as a major docking area for boats bringing goods to Tenochtitlan/Mexico City on Lake Texcoco, later via canals as the lake was slowly drained. In the latter 19th century, the La Merced market was established in the area replacing the massive La Merced monastery which was almost completely destroyed in the 1860s. This market was established to centralize the marketing of foodstuffs for the city on one area. The first La Merced market was built in 1890 and then replaced by the current building in 1957, one of the largest traditional Mexican markets in Mexico City. In the 1980s, the wholesale function of this market was taken over by the newly constructed Centro de Abasto in the south of the city, with the barrio then going into economic and social decline, with the area having problems with poverty, prostitution and population loss. Although there have been efforts to revitalize the area and the La Merced market remains important. Geography Corregidora Street near the Zocalo, entering the barrio La Merced is a ‚Äúbarrio‚Äù an unofficial city division, located in the southeast corner of the historic center of Mexico City. Although somewhat fluid, its borders are generally considered to be formed by the streets of Corregiadora, Zavala and Candelaria in the north, Fray Servando Teresa de Mier in the south, Congreso de la Uni√≥n to the east and Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez to the west. It covers a territory of 106 city blocks or 121 hectares, accounting for about thirteen and a half percent of the city's historic center. It is part of the declared World Heritage site, with about forty percent of the area's historic buildings. Officially, the area is divided among two of the boroughs of the Federal District of Mexico City, Cuauht√©moc and Venustiano Carranza. In addition, it is divided into ‚Äúcolonias‚Äù or official neighborhoods called Merced Balbuena (in Venustiano Carranza) and Colonia Centro (in Cuauht√©moc) . The neighborhood is defined by both its history and its social structure with most of formerly occupied by the massive La Merced monastery complex. The neighborhood is divided into three zones. The ‚Äúantigua‚Äù (old) section is the largest with 97 blocks and corresponds to the lands of the La Merced monastery and the first La Merced market. It is defined by the streets of San Pablo to the south, Corregiadora to the north, Circunvalaci√≥n to the east and Jos√© Mar√≠a Pino Su√°rez to the west. Here the population is more stable although it has suffered a loss of population like the rest of the historic center. Its businesses have shifted from retail outlets to warehouses with the exception of the westernmost section. The western section is almost entirely commercial with few residences. This area also has the largest number of street vendors. The San Pablo section was the former Teopan shrine. It is bordered by Fray Servando Teresa de Mier to the south, San Pablo to the north, Circunvalacion to the east and Pino Su√°rez to the west. It itself subdivides into two areas. The southeast dominated by the San Lucas plaza and the other by two churches called San Pablo el Viejo and San Pablo el Joven. The last section is dominated by the current La Merced market, commonly referred to as ‚Äúlas naves‚Äù (the naves) and belongs to the Venustiano Carranza borough. This area subdivides into the market area devoted to produce, a residential area dominated by the Candelaria de los Patos apartment complex and another residential area along the Congreso de la Uni√≥n. Socioeconomics Businesses The barrio has been mostly defined by both its socioeconomics and history, traditionally associated with retail and wholesale commerce, especially traditional Mexican foodstuffs. Its reliance on commerce done in families and influx of migrants has supported a notable social structure made up of social clusters within the barrio. As the area's commerce provided ready employment in the 20th century, the area attracted migrants from other areas of Mexico and from abroad. It has absorbed various Mexican indigenous peoples such as the Triquis, Mazahuas, Otomis, Mazatecos, Nahuas, Chinantecos and Pur√©pechas. Foreign immigration has included Lebanese, Jewish, Spanish, Greek, Italian, Turkish, French, Syrian, Irish, Hungarian, Polish, Russian, African, German, Croatian, Bohemian, and Armenian from Europe, Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and Indians from Asia as well as immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. One notable establishment related to immigration in the area is Caf√© Bagdad, which is popular among the Lebanese population, which comes to drink Middle Eastern style coffee. It is famous for its antique cash register as well as its coffee and pastries. The area remains multicultural although Catholic religious festivals still dominate. Despite being part of the historic center of Mexico City and a World Heritage Site, the area is marginalized and poor, lacking the cultural amenities found in other parts of the historic center. Its socioeconomic marginalization is a result of various disruptions such as population movement and modernization efforts that included dividing the area politically and through the construction of large thoroughfares. This history has made residents skeptical of government interventions. Depopulation of the areas since the 1980s has limited residential areas west of the La Aguilita Plaza, which has acted as a barrier to commercial growth to the west side. This area has problems with squatting, prostitution, robbery, the establishment of strip clubs and corruption. Many of the buildings were traditionally of mixed use being residence, storage and commercial, with commercial uses on the lower floors and residential uses for the upper. The depopulation has led to many building with empty upper floors despite the fact that the city overall has a housing shortage. The most visible of the area's ills is prostitution, being one of Mexico City's seven red-light districts where the practice is tolerated by authorities. The tolerance has led to problems with the trafficking of women . Lines of prostitutes can be seen even in the daytime. The estimated number in the area vary between 800 and 1,200, with most seen on Fridays, Saturdays and traditional paydays. Most perform their services in one of four hotels. The youngest, fairest and thinnest of the prostitutes are generally found on San Pablo Street. A wider variety of ages, colors and sizes are found on Anillo de Circunvalaci√≥n and Mixcalco as well as alleyways near La Soledad. About forty percent are from Puebla and Tlaxcala, thirty percent from Oaxaca, twenty percent from Veracruz, Chiapas, Hidalgo and Tabasco, with the rest from Mexico City, the State of Mexico and Morelos. The Brigada Callejera (Streetwalker Brigade) is a civil organization founded in 1983 to protect the human rights of prostitutes, and well as of transgender people and people with HIV/AIDS. The organization states that most prostitutes begin as minors and in 2008 prompted the city to crack down on hotels in La Merced and Buenavista where sexual exploitation of women and girls was worst. However, the problem persists. Legends and stories In addition to a long history, the area is home to many legends and ghost stories. These include that of Esperanza Goyeneche de Ruiz Garica whose ghost is said to appear in narrow alleys. One related to the old Merced church states that the priest once caught a thief there. The priest then cut off the thief's hand and displayed it in the church to deter others. A reference to this story can be seen with the representation of a hand at the entrance of a house facing the Plaza Alonso Garcia Bravo. In the 1980s a rumor began about a fifty-kilo rat blamed for the disappearance of domestic cats and dogs. Although proof was never found, many people still believe the story, said to have gotten to that size eating the mounds of garbage produced by the La Merced market. Landmarks Plaza de la Aguilita With a few exceptions, buildings have not been preserved for their historic value but rather used for commercial purposes. There are seventeen historic sites declared with the World Heritage Site declaration in 1980, 39 declared such by INAH and 33 more contained in other catalogs. The most important of these is the cloister of the La Merced monastery, the parish of La Soledad, the church and former convent of Jes√∫s Mar√≠a, the former monastery of San Ger√≥nimo, the Candelaria chapel, the parishes of Santo Tom√°s de la Palma, San Pablo el Viejo and San Pablo en Nuevo, the San Luca chapel, the monastery hospital of San Camilo, the San Jos√© de Gracia church, the Hospital San L√°zaro, the Palace of the Counts of Calimaya and the Casa Talavera. Other historic landmarks include the Casa de las Gallas, the Casa de Calpixques, the former Garita de San L√°zaro and the Casa de Diezmo. Thirty nine of these buildings are at high risk of being lost. Casa Talavera The best known landmark of the barrio is not historic but rather commercial, a massive traditional market of the same name, La Merced . Located in the barrio's heart, between Anillo de Circunvalacion and Moraz√°n streets, this market is one of the largest of its kind in Latin America. With the main structure 400 meters long and containing over 3,000 stalls, with its own Metro station inside. In its earlier history, it was not only the wholesale market for the city but one of the main ones for the country. The Nave Mayor sells produce and the Nave Menor sells meat, fish, dairy, packaged groceries and cold cuts. A section called the ‚Äúdesnivel‚Äù (not-level) has a variety of food stalls. There is also an area dedicated to handcrafts, tools/utensils and toys and annexes dedicated to fresh and artificial flowers and plants as well as one dedicated to candy. While still a large an important market, at its height it supported hundreds human carriers called mecalapers, watchmen, baggers and warehousers, trades such as carpentry, tailoring and glassworking and other businesses such as restaurants, lodging, cantinas and bars specializing in pulque. The origin of the barrio's name really comes from a monastery built at the end of the 16th century called Nuestra Se√±ora de la Merced de la Redenci√≥n de los Cautivos (Monastery of Our Lady of Grace of the Redemption of Captives), the only major Mercedarian establishment in New Spain . All that remains of a complex that extended over most of what is now the modern barrio is a small cloister near the Plaza Alonso Garc√≠a Bravo, noted for its highly elaborate relief work. Casa de Diezmo of La Merced Another major colonial religious institution was the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a convent, which was founded in the 16th century for upper-class Spanish women. It was home to the illegitimate daughter of Philip II of Spain. Only the main patio of the convent and its accompanying church remain. The convent building was home to a furniture store and a cinema but today it is abandoned and being rehabilitated by INAH. One notable area in the barrio is Talavera Street near the La Merced Market. Today that street is for pedestrians only, dominated by an altar dedicated to the Santo Ni√±o de Atocha. This altar commemorates the area's traditional commerce in items for Child Jesus figures in Mexico, especially clothes for rites related to Candlemas. Today it is also noted for selling clothing for people as well. At the intersection of Talavera and El Salvador there is a large former mansion from the 18th century. Its facade is of red tezontle with simple ornamentations. This is called the Casa Talavera which is today a cultural center. Its name comes from the fact that it was the first producer of Talavera pottery in Mexico. It was the property of the marquis of San Miguel de Aguayo. Next to this structure is a square called the Plaza Aguilita (little eagle) or Plaza Juan Jos√© Baz. In its center, there is a fountain with a figure of an eagle on a nopal cactus with a snake in its mouth, as this spot, according to tradition, is where the Mexica saw this sign, telling them to settle here. The Plaza Alonso Garcia Bravo is home to a permanent tianguis, with carps blocking the view of the fountain and the monument to the Spaniard responsible for outlay of modern Mexico City after the Conquest. On the north side of the plaza, there is number of notable buildings. One of these has a highly decorated niche with an image of Apostle James the Great. At the top of the niche there is an image of a hand, which refers to the legend of the thief. Another of the buildings dates from between 1870 and 1906 with three levels in Neo classical style and the one next to that is distinguished by three large arches on its facade. These buildings have the names of the architects and stone workers engraved on their walls. One other building is distinguished by a series of winged fishes that appear inside niches. The Parish of Santo Tom√°s La Palma has a Baroque portal made of sandstone which features a Christ on the cross in relief. It has a wide one level bell tower which extends up from the center. Inside, the vaults have paintings and the main altar has an image of Saint Thomas touching the wound on Christ's side. The cupola has angel decoration with an image of Juan Diego with the Virgin of Guadalupe. Another notable feature is the arch of the doorway leading to the sacristy. The Casa del Diezmo or Alh√≥ndiga, is from the 16th century. What remain is the fa√ßade of the building with a small bridge in front as a reminder of the canal that used to pass in front of it. Its original function was to collect the ten-percent tithe for the church from all commercial activity in the city. Manzanares Street is home to the Manzanares Church, considered to be the smallest in Mexico City. Off one of its alleys, there is a large home from the 16th century which is the only one owned by an indigenous person from the era still standing. History Pre Hispanic period The La Merced area is one of the oldest parts of Mexico City, settled by the Mexica over 700 years ago, known as Tempan or Teopan. Tradition states that here is where the Mexica saw the sign from the god Huitzilopochtli to end their wanderings, with the first temple to that god built on what was then a small island in Lake Texcoco. As the city of Tenochtitlan grew, this area became the southeast corner of the city, known as Tempan or Teopan. Even though the temple to Huitzilopochtli was moved, the area remained important with a shrine to Eh√©catl, the Casa de Pajaros and a brewery that produced pulque for the royal palace. Colonial period Plaza Alonso Garcia Bravo After the conquest of the Aztec Empire by the Spanish, the city of Tenochtitlan was reconfigured but the new layout did not affect this area of the city that much because it was criss-crossed by various canals and chinampas or artificial extensions of land. At first the only changes were the expansion of plazas and the construction of bridges wide enough to allow the passage of horses and carriages. Political changes to the area began early with the territory divided into three parts: Parcialidad de San Pablo, Cuartel and Colonia Centro. Although the barrio's name of La Merced is associated with the modern market, the area is really named after the La Merced monastery . However, the area's association with commerce began early in the colonial period. Despite the beginning of projects to drain Lake Texcoco, canals were an important means of getting goods from other parts of the Valley of Mexico into Mexico City, much of which arrived to this barrio by this means until the early 20th century. During the colonial period, the main grain market was here as was the building where the Church collected its tithe, the Alh√≥ngida Casa del Diezmo as well as two of the largest and richest monasteries of the time, Jes√∫s Mar√≠a and La Merced and various mansions including that of the Marquis de Aguayo which is now called the Casa Talavera. The Parcialidad de San Pablo- Teopan remained an important area of the city with government buildings and churches and other important structures. Ones that remain in whole or in part include the former monastery of La Merced, the convent of Jes√∫s Mar√≠a, Manzanares, Santo T√≥mas La Palma, San Pablo el Viego, San Lucas, San Ram√≥n, Balvanera, San Jos√© de Gracias, Porta Coeli, La Soledad, La Santa Cruz (La Candelaria, Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena, San L√°zaro, San Camilo, the first Casa de Correos, the Casa de Diezmo, Casa de Cuna (Ni√±os Exp√≥sitos), Casa de la Gallas, La Alh√≥ndiga and the Garita de San L√°zaro. While the La Merced area was one of the main reception areas for the city in the colonial period, initially, the main markets were in and around the main square or Zocalo. Mostly these were noisy and dirty open air markets called tianguis. At various points in its history, the city has tried to reorder and modernize wholesale and retail sales. In 1791, the Mercado de Volador market was constructed on a site just off the Zocalo, where the Supreme Court now stands. Post Independence However, by the latter 1800s, this market had become overcrowded. In the 1860s, the Reform Laws expropriated the monastery and much of it was destroyed. The merchants from Volador were relocated to this area. This movement changed the Merced neighborhood to its current commercial character. The most important change to the area was the expropriation of the lands of the La Merced monastery (most of the current barrio) to be demolished to construct commercial and residential spaces. In the 1860s, this vast monastery complex, which covered most of the barrio's current extension was almost entirely demolished as part of efforts to modernize the historic center of Mexico City. In 1890, the first La Merced Market was constructed to concentrate the commerce of foodstuffs on one area and modernize the informal markets which already existed along the canal docks. This effort coincided with the national business interests as well as foreign investors in Mexico and prompted the development of services such as electricity, running water, telegraph and transport options such as trains, trolleys and automobiles. 20th century to the present View inside part of the market At the beginning of the 20th century, the barrio was politically split with the reorganization of the Federal District. The west portion became part of the Cuauht√©moc borough and the east part of the Venustiano borough. The outbreak of the Mexican Revolution caused a decline in the area's commerce, but this recovered slowly after the fighting ended, returning to former levels by the 1950s. During this decade, it became the most important wholesale food market in Mexico City, prompting the building of new business and services such as hotels, taxis, bus terminals and public restrooms. This recovery of the commerce in the first half of the 20th century attracted migration into the barrio both from within Mexico and from abroad, especially from the 1930s and 1950s. Migrants from Mexico were from rural areas and included various indigenous groups. Foreign immigrant groups were mostly Arab, Lebanese and Jewish groups, as well as Armenians, Greeks, Spanish, French, Italians, and Hungarians among other groups were also present in the neighbourhood. Almost all became involved in commerce as workers and as business owners. Immigrants diversified the commerce of the area, expanding into household items, handcrafts, fabric, paper goods and clothing. In the 1950s, new modernization efforts were begun by Mexico City mayor Ernesto P. Uruchurtu. Old tenements in the area were replaced by large apartment buildings, especially in the La Candelaria de los Patos and La Soledad areas. Main thoroughfares were constructed and widened such as Anillo de Circunvalaci√≥n, Pino Su√°rez, Fray Servando Teresa de Mier and San Pablo. However, the most iconic project was the replacement of the 19th century La Merced market with the current structure. This new building was designed by architect Enrique del Moral and opened in 1957, built next to the Anillo de Circunvalaci√≥n. From the 1960s to the early 1980s, the historic center of Mexico City continued to grow rapidly, becoming crowded. In the 1980s, the Mexico City government decided to promote development in the outer zones of the Federal District. New apartment construction was concentrated in areas such as Iztapalapa and the main inter- city bus station was closed, moving its function to four new stations (Central Norte, TAPO, Taxque√±a and Poniente) . However, the most important change was the construction of the Central de Abasto in Iztapalapa, taking over La Merced's role as the main wholesale food market for the city. Although, the area was included the construction of the first Metro line, the disruption of commerce and affordable housing disrupted La Merced's social structures as many families move out, following jobs and other resources in Iztapalapa. Those that remained behind faced problems with poverty, violent crime and the rise of prostitution. The deterioration was further reinforced due to the destruction caused by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake . In the 1980s, the area, along with the rest of the historic center of the city, was declared a World Heritage Site which allowed for measures to preserve some of La Merced's historic buildings. However, the lack of clear guidelines and resources did not allow for full implementation of preservation efforts. The 1985 earthquake affected a part of the area including historic buildings. However most reconstruction efforts had to be centered on created new residences to replace those destroyed. Since the 1980s, the population of the area has continued to decline, with areas becoming almost entirely commercial, with the introduction of new businesses such as paper goods stores after 1985, which took over former residential space such as the second and third floors of buildings. This change also prompted real estate speculation. Most of the population now is on the west side of the traditional area starting from the Aguilita plaza, which acts as a barrier to commercial growth into the western side. Starting in the 2000s, there have been efforts to renovate areas of the barrio, to make it more attractive to tourists and other visitors. A number of streets such as Republic de El Salvador, Mesones, Rold√°n, Santo Tomas and Corregiadora have been converted into the ‚ÄúAlh√≥ndiga-Talavera pedestrian corridor.‚Äù The corridor has improvements in lighting, signs. A Metrobus line has been established through the area, and the Turibus goes through part of it. From 2009 and 2012,100 million pesos were invested in this pedestrian area as well as restoring the facades of a number of historic buildings, commercial spaces such as Rold√°n and the redesign of Plaza Alonso Garc√≠a Bravo.

The 9th named storm and 11th storm of the 1991 Pacific hurricane season, the system formed from two tropical waves. The pair moved across the Atlantic during the first ten days of September. The second of the two spawned Tropical Storm Erika in the eastern Atlantic. Emerging into the eastern Pacific between the September 10 and September 12, an area of thunderstorms developed southeast of an upper level cyclone off the southern tip of Baja California Sur due to the interaction of the upper cyclone with the pair of tropical waves. By the September 15, the thunderstorm activity organized into bands, indicating the presence of a new tropical depression, the eleventh of the season. The cyclone moved north-northwest due to steering around the upper cyclone, and became a tropical storm by noon on the September 16. Once the upper cyclone moved away from Ignacio, its motion towards the Mexican coast stopped on September 17, and it executed a slow anticyclonic loop that would be completed late on the September 18. Proximity to land and west to southwesterly vertical wind shear weakened the cyclone, and Ignacio regained tropical depression status late on the September 18. The system dissipated as a tropical cyclone that night, and its remnants moved west- southwest into the tropical Pacific, occasionally flaring up new convection over the succeeding couple days. Meteorological history The origins of Ignacio formed from two tropical waves. The pair moved across the Atlantic during the first ten days of September. The second of the two spawned Tropical Storm Erika in the eastern Atlantic. It emerged into the eastern Pacific between the September 10 and September 12. An area of thunderstorms developed southeast of an upper level cyclone off the southern tip of Baja California Sur due to the interaction of the upper cyclone with the pair of tropical waves. It had become a broad area of convection located to the east of a quasi-stationary mid-level trough axis along 115¬∞W. The area of disturbance became a tropical depression on September 16, about southwest of Acapulco. The storm continued to intensify and became a tropical storm later in the day. The tropical cyclone's forward motion was slow, along with a small clockwise loop, a track that was somewhat unexpected. Ignacio was centered around offshore and was near its peak intensity of a minimum central pressure of on the evening of September 17. Once the upper cyclone moved away from Ignacio, its motion towards the Mexican coast stopped on September 17, and it executed a slow anticyclonic loop that would be completed late on the September 18. The surface pressure fell to at Zinhuatenejo and at Manzanillo. Tropical storm warnings were issued for the affected portion of southwest Mexico. The few surface-observing sites reported many hours of rain, some locally heavy, from noon on September 16 to early on September 18. Several ships reported tropical storm-force winds. The OMI Willamette reported the highest surface winds of the event. Ignacio weakened quickly on September 18, probably due to the combined effects of the storm's close proximity to land and persistence of waters likely cooled by upwelling. Strong winds aloft, shearing Ignacio from the southwest, might have contributed to the weakening as well. Ignacio was downgraded to a tropical depression on September 19 and became a remnant low later that day. The remnants of Ignacio, identified on satellite imagery as occasional flare-ups of convection, moved west-southwestwards over the next two days. Preparations and impact Rainfall caused by Ignacio throughout Mexico When Ignacio was closely approaching the coast of Mexico, a tropical storm warning was issued from Zihuatenajo to Cuyutan on September 16. When Ignacio was forecast to move up the coast, the warnings were extended to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco on September 17. However, the warnings were dropped when the cyclone dissipated. Despite remaining offshore, the outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Ignacio widespread rain to Mexico. The highest amount recorded was at Pasa de San Antonio. The storm also caused street flooding in Acapulco. Ten people died in Guerrero due to flash flooding. In addition, heavy rains and high ways brought widespread damage to nine other Mexican states. The remnants of the storm caused several dams to burst in the state of Chihuahua, leaving 10,000 people homeless and killing another 13. In all, 40 people were injured.

Amba was abducted by Kuru prince Bhishma and holds him responsible for her misfortune. Her sole goal in life became his destruction, to fulfill which she was reborn as Shikhandini, the daughter of king Drupada and the sister of the epic's heroine Draupadi. Background Amba was the eldest daughter of the king of Kashi. She had two younger sisters Ambika and Ambalika. Amba is a commonly used word in Sanskrit meaning mother, also with Vedic linkage as the mother of the Vedas. Swayamvara Bhishma taking the three princesses of Kashi after the swayamvara The Adi Parva of the Mahabharata narrates about Amba's swayamvara at the Kingdom of Kashi. Amba and Salva, the king of Saubala, were secretly in love and Amba had promised to place the varmala on his neck. Bhishma came to know of the ceremony of the three beautiful princesses, and went to the Swayamvara to win the princesses for his step-brother Vichitravirya. Once arrived, Bhishma announced his intention to abduct the brides, challenging the assembled suitors to stop him. Bhishma forced the princesses into his chariot and rode away. The kings followed and showered Bhishma with arrows; however, Bhishma returned the attack and defeated them. Salva challenged Bhishma for a duel; Bhishma overpowered and wounded Salva, but spared his life. Unaware of Amba's feelings, Bhishma proceeded to Hastinapur and presented them to Satyavati, who made arrangements for their marriage to Vichitravirya. Amba approached Bhishma and the council of Brahmins and revealed that she and Salva were in love with each other and that she was going to choose him as her husband in the Swayamvara. Bhishma conceded that her reasoning was sound and sent her to Salva with honors, while Ambika and Ambalika were married to Vichitravirya. Salva's rejection In the Ambopakhyanaparvan chapter of the book Udyoga Parva of the Mahabharata, the rest of Amba's tale is narrated by Bhishma when Duryodhana questioned him as to why he did not kill Shikhandi, an ally of the Pandavas, cousins and foes of the Kauravas. Bhishma ensured that Amba was escorted safely to Salwa Kingdom. Amba informed Salva that she had come for him. Salva retorted that he no longer desired her, as she was to be wed to another man. He declared that she was rightfully won by Bhishma, who defeated and insulted him and other kings and accused her of happily leaving with him. Amba pleaded with Salva, whom she considered her true love, to accept her. But Salva reiterated Kshatriya dharma and refused to accept her. Rejected, the heart broken Amba left Salwa Kingdom and went to the forest. In another version, Amba peeved by this rejection then went to Bhishma and accosted him saying that he was responsible for all her problems. Bhishma tried to convince Vichitraviraya to marry Amba, but he rejected her on the plea that she was in love with someone else. She then approached Bhishma to marry her. He also refused due to his vow of celibacy. This further infuriated Amba, as she had now been spurned by three people. She appealed to various kings to defeat Bhishma and do her justice, but all of them refused knowing Bhishma's capabilities. Finally, she went to the forest to please the gods so that she can have her revenge on Bhishma . Vengeance on Bhishma Parshurama's mediation The sage Narada and the gods stop Bhishma's battle with Parashurama. Amba reflected on her condition and considered all the people responsible for it, including herself (as she did not escape Bhishma's chariot when Bhishma was fighting Salva), Bhishma (who abducted her), Salva (who rejected her) and her father (who arranged her swayamvara). She finally arrived at the conclusion that Bhishma was the main culprit and swore to destroy him by austerities or battle. She sought shelter with a group of ascetics that night and narrated her tale to them. There the learned sage Shaikhavatya consoled Amba and promised to guide her in her austerities. Other sages discussed amongst themselves Amba's situation and contemplated her alternatives and advised her to return to her father as there are only two true protectors of a woman: a father and a husband. However, Amba declined, deciding to practice austerities. On the next day, the sage Hotravahana (of the Srinjaya race), a former king and Amba's maternal grandfather, passed by the place. Upon listening to the tale of Amba's ordeal, the sage advised her not to return to her father and instead approach the sage Parashurama. Akritavrana, one of Parashurama's disciples, also arrived at the place. Hotravahana introduced Amba to Akritavrana and both of them explained Amba's ordeal to him. Akritavrana gave Amba two options: either Parashurama should approach Salva to marry her or Bhishma should be defeated by Parashurama. Amba asked Akritavrana to decide who was her culprit. Akritavrana agreed with Amba that Bhishma was the root cause of her plight and should be the target of her revenge. Akritavrana and Hotravahana explained Amba's predicament to Parashurama, whom Amba herself prayed to for help. Parashurama gave his word to Amba that he would slay Bhishma, who was his disciple in the past, and destroy his pride. When Parashurama arrived with his retinue at Kurukshetra and sent a message to Bhishma of his arrival, Bhishma came to see his guru, offering him the traditional respects. A pleased Parashurama commanded Bhishma to accept Amba. Bhishma refused, restating that he had taken a vow of celibacy. An infuriated Parashurama threatened Bhishma with death. Bhishma tried to calm the sage, but in vain, and he finally agreed to battle his guru to safeguard his Kshatriya duty. Ganga tried stopping the battle by beseeching her son as well as the great sage, but failed. The great battle lasted for 23 days, without any result. On the 24th day when Bhishma chose to use a deadly weapon, at the behest of the divine sage Narada and the gods, Parashurama ended the conflict and the battle was declared a draw. Parashurama narrated the events to Amba and told her to seek Bhishma's protection. However, Amba refused to listen to Parashurama's advice and left angrily declaring that she would achieve her objective by asceticism. Austerities Amba gave up food and sleep, and practised asceticism standing still for six months in the Yamuna river valley, surviving only on air. She became emaciated and developed matted locks. After that, she stood in the waters of the Yamuna, without food and practised austerities. After that, she spent time standing on her tip toes, having eaten only one fallen leaf of a tree. Her penance for twelve years started burning the heavens and the earth. She then went to Vatsa kingdom, in which many renowned sages lived. She roamed the kingdom, bathing in the sacred waters of the Ganges (Ganga) and the Yamuna. Then, she visited the ashrams of many sages like Narada, Uluka, Chyavana, Vishwamitra, Mandavya, Dwilipa, Ramhrada and Garga as well as sacred sites like Prayag, Bhogavati and holy groves. During her journey, she observed difficult vows and performed ablutions in the holy waters. The goddess Ganga appeared before Amba and listened to Amba's tale that her austerities were aimed to destroy Bhishma, Ganga's son. The angry goddess Ganga replied that since Amba's mind was crooked, she would be become a crooked and tortuous river, which will remain dry for eight months and flow in the four months of the rainy season. Ganga declared that the bathing places along the river's course would be in difficult terrain, and it will be infested with crocodiles and other fierce creatures. Amba wandered practising severe vows and forgoing food and water for months. She visited many tirthas in this time and finally returned to Vatsa, where Ganga's curse materialized. Though half of her became the river Amba, the other half remained human, due to her ascetic merit. Shiva's boon and Amba's death The ascetics of Vatsa dissuaded her to refrain from the austerities, but Amba maintained her resolve and told them her desire was to be born a man and slay Bhishma to avenge her misery. The god Shiva appeared to her and blessed her that she would become a man in her next birth and destroy Bhishma. Amba would be born to the king Drupada of Panchala and become a great warrior. Amba would remember her previous birth and hatred of Bhishma. Pleased with the boon, Amba created a funeral pyre of wood on the banks of the Yamuna and jumped in the fire saying \\"for Bhishma's destruction!\\". Garland of ever-fresh lotuses Another variant narrates that Amba performed austerities and pleased Kartikeya, the god of war and Shiva's son. He granted her a garland of ever-fresh lotuses and declared that whoever wore it will destroy Bhishma. With this garland, Amba made one more attempt to seek help of many kings and princes to support her in her just cause. However, there was no response from anyone of them to help her as they did not want to be on the wrong side of Bhishma. In a final effort she approached Drupada but even he declined; in frustration she cast the garland off on a pillar outside Drupada's palace and went for austerities in the forest again. While Amba kills herself, no one dares to touch the garland. Rebirth as Shikhandi Bhishma (left) refuses to fight Shakhandi (right). Drupada had no children so he did austerities in the forest seeking the blessings of Shiva for begetting a son. Shiva granted him the boon that a girl would be born to him, but will transform into a boy later. As prophesied, Amba was reborn as Shikhandini, whose true gender was not disclosed and she was brought up as a boy. When Drupada got his daughter in the garb of a son married to the daughter of Hiranyavarna, the king of Dasharna, his true identity was revealed not only to the chagrin of the girl, her father but also to Shikandini himself. The agitated Hiranyavarna declared war on Panchala. Distressed by the turn of events, Shikhandini went into the forest to fast unto death but was saved by a yaksha (a forest deity), Sthunakarna, who helped him by offering his own gender in exchange to Shikandini's female gender. Thus Shikhandini became the male Shikhandi. After Hiranyavarna's death, Shikhandi returned to swap sexes with the yaksha, however the yaksha was cursed by his master the god Kubera to remain female until Shikhandi's death. In the variant where the garland of ever-fresh lotuses is mentioned, Shikhandini wears the garland once and Drupada realizes that she will slay Bhishma. Meanwhile, over the course of time, Ambika and Ambalika had grandchildren Kauravas and Pandavas, who became arch enemies. Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada, was married to the Pandavas. When a great Kurukshetra war between Pandavas and Kauravas ensued, Shikhandi sided with his brothers-in-law, while Bhishma was with the Kauravas. Bhishma had vowed to \\"not to shoot at a woman, anyone who used to be a woman or has a woman‚Äôs name or appears to be a woman\\", so he narrated to the Kaurava leader Duryodhana Amba's tale and refused to fight to Shikhandi. When Bhishma led the Kaurava army, Shikhandi rode as the charioteer of Arjuna, the third of the Pandava brothers. On seeing Shikhandi, Bhishma lowered his weapons. Shikhandi and Arjuna pierced Bhishma's body, though all Shikhandi's arrows were not so effective in wounding Bhishma. At this stage, it was also the desire of Bhishma to die. Before collapsing, he cried out that it was Arjuna's arrow that killed him and not of Shikhandi. Bhishma lay on a bed of arrows for days and died on the holy day of Uttarayana. Amba's vengeance was fulfilled when Shikhandi became the cause of Bhishma's death. Shikhandi is killed in a sword fight with Ashwatthama when Ashwatthama, Kripacharya, and Kritavarma attacked the Pandava camp on the night of the final day of battle.K M Ganguly (1883-1896).

They had two sons; Andrew L. Todd Jr. (who would become mayor of Murfreesboro) and Andrew L. Todd III (1929-2010). He graduated from Union University (formerly Southwestern Baptist University) in Jackson, Tennessee and taught in public schools for several years before enrolling at the University of the South to study law. Career He was elected as Rutherford County Superintendent of Schools from 1900 to 1907 and Governor Frazier appointed him to the State Board of Education in 1905 where he continued to serve until 1915. As a member of the Board of Education he lobbied to locate the state's new teacher's college to Murfreesboro. The \\"Middle Tennessee State Teachers College\\" evolved into the present day Middle Tennessee State University. From 1913 to 1923, Todd served in the Tennessee General Assembly, two terms in the House and two terms in the Senate. As Speaker of the Senate in the 61st General Assembly, and Speaker of the House in the 62nd General Assembly, he is the only person in Tennessee history to have served in both capacities. Apart from his political career, Todd was also an active businessman. He established the \\"Toddington Farms\\" which specialized in pure-bred Aberdeen-Angus cattle and served as president of the \\"Murfreesboro Bank & Trust Co.\\" from 1913 to 1929. He also bought two local news papers and merged them into The Daily News Journal. Legacy Todd is sometimes referred to as the \\"godfather\\" of Middle Tennessee State University and he continued to support the school until his death.

Perhaps most well known for his work with Team ChannelFireball, he was the American national champion in 2010 and 2013, and the Player of the Year for the 2012‚Äì13 season. He has reached the top 8 of six Pro Tours, losing to the eventual champion each time.  Career  Utter-Leyton started playing Magic in 1994, but remained a casual player until 2005, when he started playing Magic Online. He made his Pro Tour debut at Pro Tour Hollywood 2008, and although his Pro Tour finishes in 2008 and 2009 were unimpressive, he managed to remain qualified for all the events, and he was one of the original members of Team ChannelFireball. His breakout performance was his 5th-place finish at Pro Tour San Juan 2010, where he lost in the quarterfinals to eventual champion Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. Three months later, Utter-Leyton won the United States National Championship, and in November he reached the top 8 of a Grand Prix for the first time. Though the US National Team would end up at a disappointing 15th place at the World Championships in Chiba, Utter-Leyton finished 16th individually, and with that earning Level 7 status in the Pro Players Club. In the 2011 Pro Tour season, Utter-Leyton made two additional Pro Tour top 8s. At Pro Tour Philadelphia he lost in the final to Samuele Estratti, his 2nd-place finish there being his best Pro Tour finish to date. It was followed up by a 7th-place finish at the very next Pro Tour, the 2011 World Championships. He ended the year tied for 7th on 52 points, and Level 8 in the Pro Players Club. Utter-Leyton was a part of the inaugural Players Championship in 2012, later renamed the World Championship, where he finished 13th. He made a total of five Grand Prix top 8s in 2012, and when he finished 4th at Pro Tour Dragon's Maze in San Diego, Utter-Leyton became the 2012‚Äì13 Player of the Year. This also made him the US National Champion for 2013, making Utter-Leyton the first American player to be a two-time National champion. At the 2013 World Magic Cup, Utter-Leyton once again failed to put up a result with Team USA, finishing 18th. At the World Championship, however, Utter-Leyton reached the semifinals, where he was narrowly defeated 2‚Äì3 by Reid Duke. Later in the season, he finished 3rd in his fifth Pro Tour top 8 at Pro Tour Journey into Nyx, and qualified for the 2014 World Championship. Utter-Leyton was one of three players to have qualified for all three World Championships since the 2012 format change, the other two being Reid Duke and Yuuya Watanabe. He finished 11th in the event. However, despite earning 53 Pro Points and Platinum status after the 2014‚Äì15 season, Utter-Leyton did not qualify for the 2015 World Championship.

Moreover, under the equivalence, the nth homology group of a chain complex is the nth homotopy group of the corresponding simplicial abelian group, and a chain homotopy corresponds to a simplicial homotopy. (In fact, the correspondence preserves the respective standard model structures.) Example: Let C be a chain complex that has an abelian group A in degree n and zero in other degrees. Then the corresponding simplicial group is the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space K(A, n). There is also an ‚àû-category-version of a Dold‚ÄìKan correspondence. The book \\"Nonabelian Algebraic Topology\\" cited below has a Section 14.8 on cubical versions of the Dold‚ÄìKan theorem, and relates them to a previous equivalence of categories between cubical omega-groupoids and crossed complexes, which is fundamental to the work of that book.  Detailed construction  The Dold-Kan correspondence between simplicial abelian groups and chain complexes can be constructed explicitly through an adjunction of functorspg 149. The first functor is the normalized chain complex functor > N:s\\\\textbf{Ab} \\\\to \\\\text{Ch}_{\\\\geq 0}(\\\\textbf{Ab}) and the second functor is the \\"simplicialization\\" functor > \\\\Gamma:\\\\text{Ch}_{\\\\geq 0}(\\\\textbf{Ab}) \\\\to s\\\\textbf{Ab} constructing a simplicial abelian group from a chain complex.  Normalized chain complex  Given a simplicial abelian group A_\\\\bullet \\\\in \\\\text{Ob}(\\\\text{s}\\\\textbf{Ab}) there is a chain complex NA_\\\\bullet called the normalized chain complex with terms > NA_n = \\\\bigcap^{n-1}_{i=0}\\\\ker(d_i) \\\\subset A_n and differentials given by > NA_n \\\\xrightarrow{(-1)^nd_n} NA_{n-1} These differentials are well defined because of the simplicial identity > d_i \\\\circ d_n = d_{n-1}\\\\circ d_i : A_n \\\\to A_{n-2} showing the image of d_n : NA_n \\\\to A_{n-1} is in the kernel of each d_i:NA_{n-1} \\\\to NA_{n-2}. This is because the definition of NA_n gives d_i(NA_n) = 0. Now, composing these differentials gives a commutative diagram > NA_n \\\\xrightarrow{(-1)^nd_n} NA_{n-1} \\\\xrightarrow{(-1)^{n-1}d_{n-1}} > NA_{n-2} and the composition map (-1)^n(-1)^{n-1}d_{n-1}\\\\circ d_n. This composition is the zero map because of the simplicial identity > d_{n-1}\\\\circ d_n = d_{n-1}\\\\circ d_{n-1} and the inclusion \\\\text{Im}(d_n) \\\\subset NA_{n-1}, hence the normalized chain complex is a chain complex in \\\\text{Ch}_{\\\\geq 0 }(\\\\textbf{Ab}). Because a simplicial abelian group is a functor > A_\\\\bullet : \\\\text{Ord} \\\\to \\\\textbf{Ab} and morphisms A_\\\\bullet \\\\to B_\\\\bullet are given by natural transformations, meaning the maps of the simplicial identities still hold, the normalized chain complex construction is functorial.

Martial arts history In 1984 David Dangerfield had his first encounter with Aikido. On seeing a demonstration he was instantly attracted by the formal and structured nature of the art, combined with its visual beauty and obvious potential effectiveness. Dangerfield had already been training in various martial arts since 1974, including Shotokan Karate & Chinese boxing and had gained experience in the security industry. In 1986 he began training in Aikikai style Aikido. He learned from various instructors, most memorable were occasional seminars with Takeda Sensei. In 1990 he attained his Shodan (first degree black belt). In 1991 Dangerfield commenced his study of Yoshinkan Aikido with Joe Thambu Shihan of Aikido Shudokan. Dangerfield officially founded The Aikido Institute Inc as a non-profit martial arts education organisation on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland in 1991. The Aikido Institute was a full-time Dojo providing Alternative Education programmes based on Aikido for young people in local schools. Dangerfield achieved his Nidan (second degree black belt) in 1993. It was around this time that Dangerfield began to travel to Japan to further his understanding of Aikido and Budo in general. He traveled twice a year to Japan on month long training trips where he studied at the Yoshinkan Hombu dojo, training under Inoue Kyoichi Sensei and Chida Tsutomu Sensei. He also made occasional trips to the Aikikai hombu dojo in Tokyo and several trips to Iwama, where he trained with Saito Morihiro Sensei. In 1996 Dangerfield was awarded his Sandan, by this time he had already been teaching for 4 years full-time. In 1997 Dangerfield met Nishioka Tsuneo Sensei, a senior master of Shint≈ç Mus≈ç-ry≈´. This meeting had a great impact on Dangerfield and he found that his personal direction and 'style' became clearer. 2000 marked the year that he was accepted as Nishioka Sensei's student and furthered his studies in this Kobudo. In 2003 Nishioka Sensei awarded Dangerfield Oku Iri Sho and in 2006 he became one of a small number of people to receive the traditional certification 'Shomokuroku' from Nishioka Sensei. In the same year he received his Yondan (4th degree black belt) in Yoshinkan Aikido. Most recently Dangerfield was promoted to Rokudan (6th degree black belt) in the art of Aikido at the 100 years of Aikido celebrations in Malaysia 2012. Due to changes in the Yoshinkai Foundation Dangerfield, and other notable Yoshinkan instructors around the world, resigned from the organisation. Since then Dangerfield has continued to practice and teach both Aikido and Shinto Muso Ryu under the Kenshinryu Ââ£Á•ûÊµÅ. He is currently the Head Master of the Kenshinryu and CEO of Compass. In 2014 Dangerfield's first book: Martial Reflections - In Search of Wisdom was published by Icon Publishing. It is a collection of short stories that blend practicality, budo philosophy and poetic imagery. 2014 also saw David awarded the Sunshine Coast Australian Citizen of the Year award for his pioneering work with youth at-risk, alternative education and for his contribution to the disability field. Also in 2014, The Compass Institute was the winner of the Knowledge Industries & Professional Services Large Business Award at the Sunshine Coast Business Awards. The first part of the process was based on an exhaustive written application where the Institute made it as a finalist in the category ‚Äì Knowledge Industries and Professional Services. This category was one of the largest with 16 other finalists. Stage two was a 45-minute interview with 3 members of the judging panel. Winning this award signifies the hard work of the Institute as well as being strong recognition of its work within the community.  Budo and education  Being a university qualified trainer, with over 20 years of experience Dangerfield has combined his martial arts skills with education in many different ways. David Dangerfield pioneered the use of Aikido as an Alternative Education framework in Australia with intensive behavior management programmes for youth at-risk expanded to include leadership development, special needs, personal safety and teacher in-service. Between 1992 and 2006 over 7,000 school students participated in the Aikido- based life skill programmes in south east Queensland schools Topics covered in the programmes include martial values, time management, self-identity, nutrition, relationship management and of course personal safety and self- defence. In 2001, Dangerfield ran a number of workshops for many of Queensland‚Äôs Paralympic athletes, sharing with them the technical and psycho- emotional training aspects of Aikido. Budo and business Dangerfield has also worked extensively within the corporate sector, providing experiential style workshops that enable people to bring about change on an individual and organisational level. His unique approach combines his martial arts skills and experience as a trainer and educator to teach people about how to challenge or change the culture within businesses and corporations. Budo and people with disabilities In 2003 David Dangerfield founded The Compass Institute Inc, Australia‚Äôs first accredited Disability Service based on the principles of Japanese Budo. The Compass Institute Inc. provides post-school education, training and vocational opportunities to young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities. The curriculum for the centers includes regular practice in Aikido and Shinto Muso Ryu Jodo. In 2015 The Compass Institute Inc is a registered charity employing over 40 specialist staff and supporting over 90 young people with intellectual and/or physical disabilities through 6 centers from Caboolture to Gladstone. One of these centers is the working farm, which allows around 40 young people to gain access to further training in animal husbandry, horticulture, nursery work, and property maintenance.

It was located in the Berlin community at a pasture near the lake off Cullman County Road 1616 near U.S. Route 278, 6 miles (10 kilometers) east of the city of Cullman. Built in 1926, the 50-foot (15-meter) bridge was a Town Lattice truss construction over a single span. Its WGCB number is 01-22-12, originally given 01-05-14 as the Big Branch Covered Bridge. The covered bridge was originally located in Blount County near Blountsville and moved to its current location in 1958. It collapsed in early August 2001, leaving the 270-foot (82-meter) Clarkson-Legg Covered Bridge the only remaining historic covered bridge in Cullman County. History The Lidy Walker Covered Bridge was first named the Big Branch Covered Bridge, built in 1926 over Big Branch of the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River on what is now Blount County Road 47 near the intersection of Hamm Road west of Blountsville (Coordinates (34.078485, -86.658143)). Mountain Grove Branch is the main tributary in the vicinity. This was about 13 miles (21 kilometers) southeast of the current location. The bridge was open to motor vehicle traffic until 1958 when a new road bypassed it. Later that year, Berlin resident and local contractor Winford I. \\"Lidy\\" Walker purchased the Big Branch Covered Bridge for $50.00 and moved it to his farm at Lidy's Lake in Cullman County which later became a recreation area. The covered bridge soon was renamed 'Lidy Walker' after him. Visitors were able to view the historic bridge on his property until it collapsed in 2001. Walker died at his home in 2012 at age 89.

Over the course of its history, the building has been a financial institution, auditorium and retail business.National Register of Historic Places in El Paso County, Colorado. American Dreams. Retrieved May 19, 2013. Building Built in 1888 for Jerome B. Wheeler, a Colorado mining baron and financier, the building was Manitou Springs's first bank. The building is a combination of Romanesque Revival and Italian Villa architectural styles. The first floor shows two different facades. For the 717 Manitou Avenue address, there are heavy arches, with a half-circle leaded glass window at the top of each arch. The facade for the other half of the building, with the 719 Manitou Avenue address, is a recessed storefront. Between the two is an entry to the stairway to the second and third floors. The second- and third-floor facades are symmetrical across the two halves of the building, with windows set in a 3-1-3 pattern across both floors. The interior of the third floor spans both buildings and was originally an opera house; it has since been converted to an apartment. The red brick exterior, as of 2013, was painted a cream-buff color with red trim. Jerome B. Wheeler Jerome B. Wheeler Jerome B. Wheeler operated a bank in one half of the first floor. The other first floor business was a dry goods store operated by N.O. Johnson & Son. Offices were located on the second floor and an opera hall, called Wheeler Hall or Opera Hall, was on the third floor. The bank closed during the Panic of 1893. It later reopened and was a bank until 1922. The financial institution became the Bank of Manitou in a new building on Manitou Avenue. Wheeler made several donations to the town of Manitou: * $50,000 towards Manitou Avenue construction * Provided equipment for the volunteer fire company * Donated the Wheeler Clock at Manitou and Canon Avenues * Provided $10,000 for repairs following a \\"devastating\\" flood of 1913 See also * Manitou Springs Historic District * List of Manitou Springs Historic District buildings References Category:Bank buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Colorado Category:Colorado State Register of Historic Properties Category:Manitou Springs, Colorado Category:National Register of Historic Places in El Paso County, Colorado ","title":"Wheeler Bank"},{"id":"39431909","text":"Hunt is the given name of: * Hunt Downer (born 1946), American politician and major general * Hunt Emerson (born 1952), British cartoonist * Hunt Hawkins, American poet * Hunt Sales (born 1954), American rock and roll drummer * Hunt Slonem (born 1951), American painter, sculptor, and printmaker * Hunt Stromberg (1894‚Äì1968), Hollywood film producer * Hunt Walsh (1720‚Äì1795), British general and Member of the Parliament of Ireland * Hunt Stockwell, fictional character in the TV series The A-Team, played by Robert Vaughn ","title":"Hunt (given name)"},{"id":"39431919","text":"John Lettou or John of Lithuania (orig. ed.

Since this waste would have been found only in the workshop of the printer, and the indulgence was printed by Lettou, he must have been both the printer and the binder.

The very small rural community is located along State Highway 36 (SH 36) south of Brenham. Aside from the names of two local roads, the name Phillipsburg is no longer marked on modern maps. The cemetery and Lutheran church, which is still open for worship, are actually slightly to the south in neighboring Austin County. Geography Phillipsburg is situated on SH 36 at Old Phillipsburg Road from downtown Brenham. Another source stated that the community is south of Brenham. At this point, the BNSF Railway runs roughly parallel with SH 36 and on the west side of the highway. Local roads include Bilski Lane which intersects with SH 36 a short distance north of Old Phillipsburg Road and goes a short ways to the east-northeast. New Wehdem Road meets SH 36 just south of Old Phillipsburg Road and heads generally to the southwest. Phillipsburg Church Road, which approximates the Austin-Washington county line, starts at SH 36 south of Old Phillipsburg Road. Phillipsburg Church Road goes to the east-northeast before turning sharply to the south- southeast at Wonder Hill Road near St. Paul Lutheran Church of Phillipsburg. There is a state historical marker at the church, which is in Austin County. Phillipsburg Church Road goes south-southeast to Phillipsburg Cemetery, also in Austin County. Continuing in a southerly direction, the road intersects with SH 36 near Kenney. History Phillipsburg attracted mostly residents of German ethnicity. In 1889 a post office opened in the settlement, which was located along the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway. The following year, the community acquired a station along the railroad. A competing settlement named Pesch was located nearby, but by 1891 Phillipsburg was the more important of the two. Phillipsburg became a significant supply point by 1896. St. Paul Church was built in 1901 and was welcomed into the Texas Lutheran synod twenty years later. In 1904 the post office closed. In 1936 there were about 100 persons and one business establishment in the town. The population decreased to 40 in 1952 and no businesses remained in Phillipsburg by 1970. In 2000 there were 40 persons reported as living in the area.

Shortly afterward his brother tried to have him murdered for the inheritance. Post survived, and was successfully sued by an ex-girlfriend for a share of the winnings. By the end of his life, Post was $1 million in debt. Early life Post was born in Erie, Pennsylvania. His mother died when he was 8 years old and his father sent him to an orphanage soon after. Post worked in various temporary jobs such as in cooking, truck driving for traveling carnivals and circuses, and painting before winning the lottery. He even served 28 days in jail for issuing invalid checks. On the day he won the jackpot, he had just $2.46 in his bank account. Lottery jackpot Post bought one of the winning tickets of the Pennsylvania Lottery in 1988, worth $16.2 million. The total jackpot was more than $32 million, the second highest total in state history; the other half went to a group of 16 employees of the Westinghouse Electric Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in Pittsburgh. In the two weeks after Post collected the first of his 26 annual payments of $497,953.47, he spent more than $300,000 on gifts and investments such as a liquor license, a lease for a restaurant in Florida, a used-car lot, and a twin-engine airplane (despite lacking a pilot's license). In just three months' time, his debts totaled $500,000; the next year, he bought a mansion in Oil City, Pennsylvania for $395,000. According to the Washington Post, he pawned a ring for $40 and gave Ann Karpik, his landlady and occasional girlfriend, the cash for 40 tickets in the state lottery, one of which was the winning ticket. Karpik later sued Post for one-third of the lottery winnings. Murder attempt By 1989, Post was estranged from his brother. Intending to acquire Post's winnings as inheritance, his brother attempted to have Post and his sixth wife murdered, paying a hit man to do so. The attempt did not succeed, and Post's brother was arrested. Legal issues In 1989, Karpik sued Post for a portion of his lottery winnings. She claimed that they had agreed to split any winnings. After three years, a judge ruled that Post owed her one-third of all the proceeds, despite Post's vehement denial of any agreement and his inability to pay, as he was by then deeply in debt. He refused to turn over his 1992 annual payment to comply with the judgment, as a result of which the judge ordered all of his lottery payments to be frozen until the dispute was resolved. In 1998, Post was arrested on a $260,000 sailboat for refusing to serve a 6 to 24-month prison sentence on a six-year-old assault conviction; Post had fired his shotgun at a man who was coming to his mansion to collect a debt. He was also ordered by a court to stay away from his sixth wife after he fired his shotgun into her Pontiac Firebird. Personal life For most of his life Post was alienated from his siblings. He was married seven times with six of them ending in divorce. His seventh wife, Debra S. Wice, survived him, along with nine children from his first marriage. Later life Post eventually incurred over $1 million in debt. Near the end of his lifetime he survived on food stamps and a $450/month stipend. Death Post died of respiratory failure on January 15, 2006 at age 66.

Overview Two individuals, McLaughlin and Keithley, created a resort development of log cabins off of Crystal Park Road in Manitou Springs in the early 1900s. The development includes 27 log cottages in a secluded, rustic and wooded setting. The one-story cabins, built between 1920 and 1959, have cobblestone foundations, chimneys and walls. Sixteen of the buildings were built in the 1920s. They are located on Spur, Chelton, Crystal Park and Short roads. The cabins are now full-time or summer residences of private home owners. Six of the cabins were built exclusively by Everhard Keithley. He created a 10-acre wooded enclave of cabins from a \\"rocky, hilly old goat pasture\\". His granddaughter, Nancy Galles Bower, presides over the Keithley Log Cabin National Historic District and owns six cabins. Everard Keithley Everard S. Keithley worked for the Pike National Forest and from 1913 to 1946 oversaw the planting of 30 million trees. From 1926 to 1946 he was forest superintendent and was responsible for developing tree nurseries, building Rampart Range Road, fighting to open Gold Camp Road to the public and reforesting areas that had been stripped due to wildfires, logging or mining.

The band's current line-up consists of vocalist/bassist Jean Sauv√©, guitarists Richard Senko and Eduardo Victor and drummer Marsell Senko. History Beginning and first album Warcursed was formed in 2004 in Campina Grande, Para√≠ba, Brazil, initially as a Megadeth cover band, performing to modest audiences a few times in Campina Grande. The departure of then vocalist Henrique Melo and the initial writing of the first original songs brought up the desire to form an original band. The original line-up at that time consisted of Jean Sauv√© (Bass), Richard Senko (Guitar) and Marsell Senko (Drums), as well as Alan Cruz (Guitar) and Glauber Ancelmo (Vocals). From 2004 to 2010, the quintet was called Post Mortem. In 2006, still as Post Mortem, the band began recording their first demo, which would be called \\"Gates of War\\", but never actually reached the public. The early years were marked by line-up changes and several performances in Jo√£o Pessoa and Campina Grande, as well as the first concerts outside of Para√≠ba, performing in Recife-PE and Juazeiro-BA. In 2010, the band settled, now including Eduardo Victor on guitar and Jean Sauv√© also assuming the position of lead singer of the group, then becoming a quartet, after the departure of original members Alan Cruz and Glauber Ancelmo, for personal reasons. Around that time, the band dropped the name Post Mortem, favouring a name that would relate to the group only, and adopted the name Warcursed. More experienced and solid, in 2011 Warcursed returned to the stage, performing throughout the Northeast region of Brazil, and also began recording their first album, Escape From Nightmare. Lyrical themes are focused on social problems involving war, religion, insanity and existential problems, shown through an intense fusion of Death and Thrash Metal. The Escape From Nightmare record was released independently, in 2012, and the band toured extensively, playing several festivals like Grito Rock (Feira de Santana/BA, Salvador/BA, Vit√≥ria da Conquista/BA, Jo√£o Pessoa/PB), Festival Mundo (Jo√£o Pessoa/PB), Palco do Rock (Salvador-BA), Rock Cordel (Sousa/PB, Teresina/PI, Vit√≥ria da Conquista/BA), Festival Dosol (Mossor√≥/RN), Encontro da Nova Consci√™ncia (Campina Grande/PB) and Titans of Metal (Teresina/PI). The ‚ÄúEscape from Nightmare‚Äù Tour saw the widespread recognition of public and critical acclaim. The album marked the technical evolution of its members, in addition to bringing to the group the feeling of doing something that could be recognized as an important contribution to Brazilian Heavy Metal, representing the Northeast and Brazil in the Heavy Metal scene around the globe.

San Francisco; Crown Point Press gold leaf techniques in his work. His abstract color graphics are frequently suggestive of an artistic link between mid-late Japanese motifs and the modern world.  Biography  As an exchange student at Tokyo‚Äôs Sophia University, Steele studied graphic art and painting and was strongly attracted to the culture and artistic aesthetic of late Edo period and early Meiji period. His studies at Sophia were to make a lasting impression, which continued to inform his work throughout his life. He completed his studies at Texas Christian University, graduating in 1974 with a master's degree in Fine Arts. \\"Kaminari Hue in Rain\\", gold leaf chine-coll√© treatment Eventually, his style came to strongly feature late period Japanese elements and techniques, evoking the ‚Äúfloating world‚Äù of the 18th and 19th centuries. His highly recognizable, occasionally ‚Äúmilitaristic‚Äù approach was developed over decades to its current status as a point of reference for the genre. He was considered a master of abstract color relief lithography with a considerable following among those knowledgeable in this field. His earliest works featured landscape vistas fused with broadly martial representations, alternatively peaceful, then vaguely soldierly and even bellicose in composition. Throughout his career, Steele played an active role in art education both as an educator and as a lecturer and curator, maintaining affiliations with the University of South Carolina, the Southern Graphics Council, American Print Alliance, and the World Print Council. He was a significant contributor to the Southern Graphics Council International, with service to that organization spanning nearly forty years. He held nearly every position on the board and continued to be artistically active up to his death in 2012. His works are to be found in a number of permanent museum and corporate collections as well as in private hands. His life and art were celebrated from March‚ÄìApril 2013 in an exhibition of his whimsical Valentine Collection at THE Fine Art Gallery, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steele's contributions to the educational community of his home town of Beaufort, South Carolina were the subject of a posthumous tribute in the Hilton Head Island News, February 2‚Äì8, 2017.

The Convention's main innovation is that the scope of salvage law has been extended to cover \\"environmental salvage\\". \\"No cure, no pay\\" and environmental salvage The 1910 Brussels Convention had established the principle (known as \\"no cure, no pay\\") that a salvor is rewarded only if the salvage operation successfully rescues the ship or its cargo. The International Convention on Salvage expanded on this principle by introducing the concept of an \\"enhanced salvage award\\", which may be awarded by an arbitrator or a tribunal if the salvor took effective action to prevent or minimize environmental damage but nevertheless failed to salvage the ship or its cargo. The 1989 Convention entered into force on 14 July 1996 and as of April 2016 has been ratified by 69 states representing 52 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world‚Äôs merchant fleet. The impetus for the new Convention was the LOF 1980 which permitted salvage rewards to be made to salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 & 14 of the Convention made provision for \\"Special Compensation\\", but The Nagasaki Spirit caseThe Nagasaki Spirit [1997] 1 Lloyds Rep 323 Case report revealed that the Convention had been poorly drafted and, rather than encouraging environmental salvors, instead it limited the amount that such salvors could be paid to mere \\"out-of- pocket expenses\\", with no allowance for any profit margin. This deficiency has since been addressed by the SCOPIC codicil to the LOF.

Tully was born Peter Graig (a spelling mistake in the birth register) Tutungi in Carlton, Melbourne on 17 December 1947. At the age of five Tully's family moved to the beach resort of Lorne in Victoria. Of Arabic/Egyptian origin, his grandparents had migrated to Australia between the wars and anglicised their name to the more acceptable Tully. At the age of 16 Tully moved to Melbourne, first working as a clerk, but later moving into display, making props for Public Benefit Shoes, and later with a German display company. In 1969 Tully, accompanied by the fashion designer Linda Jackson and her partner, the photographer Fran Moore, went to live in Lae in Papua New Guinea. After a year living in Lae the three set out on the hippy trail to Europe, spending much of 1970 and 1971 traveling through South East Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. In 1971 Tully arrived in Paris, where he taught English, and undertook trips to the Netherlands and Spain. It was in Paris that Tully became particularly impressed by the collections of African and Oceanic art. In 1972 Tully met up with Linda and Fran in London, before he made his way back to Australia, via Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and India. During this return trip he was particularly impressed by the use of leather and non-precious materials in jewellery in Sudan, and the sale by weight, rather than workmanship, of jewellery in Ethiopia. Meeting up again with Linda and Fran in Thailand, he returned to Melbourne in 1973. In 1973 Tully met the artist and activist David McDiarmid, becoming lovers for the following two years, and remaining friends and collaborators till Tully‚Äôs death in 1992. Tully and McDiarmid moved to Sydney in 1975, joining their Melbourne friend and creative collaborators Linda Jackson, who had moved there with her partner Fran Moore in 1973. This period also saw McDiarmid, Tully and Jackson collaborating with Melbourne fashion designer and retailer Clarence Chai and Sydney-based fashion designer and retailer Jenny Kee. After their move to Sydney with Tully and McDiarmid were soon involved with Kee‚Äôs fashion store Flamingo Park in Strand Arcade, hand-painting fabrics for Jackson‚Äôs dresses. His experience of traditional tribal cultures through many years of travel in New Guinea, Africa and India - along with the vibrant and creative urban sub- cultural 'tribes' he saw New York - stimulated the development of his 'urban tribalwear'. In 1977 Tully held his second one-man exhibition, exhibiting his Australiana-themed jewellery at Paraphethana Gallery. Tully was undoubtedly the most influential designer involved with the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, through his role as artistic director from 1982-1986 and through the establishment and management of the Workshop. It was in these roles that Tully greatly contributed to the transformation of the Mardi Gras from a political march to cultural event. He once said of the legendary Paradise Garage disco in New York: 'It was about 85% black and very exciting. They played the best music I'd never heard and the people dressed. Even though they didn't dress expensively, they had lots of style. They could wear a paper bag and look like a million dollars. And they really impressed me. So that was the impetus to get into costume.' Peter Tully died in Paris in August 1992 from an AIDS- related illness, he was 45.

History The East Gallatin Recreation Area began as a gravel pit and the city dump. Early photos show a steep sided water filled pit, surrounded by weeds and old refrigerators and car parts poking out of the bare ground. The land was transferred to the state parks department by Glen Hash, whose business owned the gravel pit and some adjacent land. The cleanup was accomplished through local donations and volunteer labor. The area is named for the East Gallatin River which forms the eastern edge of the park. Early volunteer work was performed by local volunteers and businesses under the leadership of the volunteer group organized as the East Gallatin Recreation Area Task Force. After about ten years the newly formed Bozeman Sunrise Rotary Club took over the volunteer leadership and has made great progress. https://bozemansunriserotary.org/SitePage/east-gallatin- recreation-area-1 As of 2018 detailed plans have been created to improve the roads and parking sometime in 2019.

There are several books that have been written on using drama games that can serve as excellent resources for anyone wanting to incorporate drama games into their work. Games for Actors and Non-Actors by Augusto Boal is perhaps the best known internationally and includes writings on his life work as well as hundreds of games. There are also smaller books however, which serve as excellent practical guides. For example, Drama Games by Bernie Warren is an excellent pocket book for someone looking to try drama games for the first time. Choral speaking Choral dramatization involves students reading aloud by assigning parts to each group member. Choral dramatization can use texts such as rhymes, poetry, and picture books. Students can experiment with voice, sound gesture and movement (Swartz, 1995). Tableaux Tableaux involve students creating visual pictures with their bodies, emphasizing key details and relationships (Wilheim, 2002). Tableaux are frozen scenes and usually involve at least three levels. Students focus on a focal point, facial expressions, and body language. This technique is useful for maturing participants' presentational skills as well as audience skills. Improvisation Improvisation is the practice of acting and reacting, of making and creating, in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one‚Äôs immediate environment; see wikipedia: Improvisation. Improvisation can be a great introduction to role playing. Students focus on position, expression and creativity in their impromptu skits. Role playing Role playing allows students to play a character in a real or imaginary situation. One of the simplest forms is where ‚Äúthe student plays himself faced with an imaginary situation.‚Äù (Wilheim, 2002, p. 62) Other strategies have students playing real-life or imaginary characters in a variety of contexts. Role play can be used throughout many areas of the curriculum, especially history and language arts to support and strengthen understanding of content. Below is a list of some common role-play strategies. * Reenactment: Students perform scenes from a historical time period or a scene in a story. ‚ÄúAn enactment may be cast in the past, the present, or the future, but always happens in the ‚Äònow of time‚Äô‚Äù (Wilheim, 2002, p.8). This strategy encourages students to interact with a text and challenges them to take on the perspective of a character. * Extended role play: Students may create the scene that takes place before or after a story or scene. This strategy helps students to predict and theorize about cause and effect. * Hotseat: Student is interviewed in character. By putting the character from a scene, event or story on the ‚Äústand‚Äù students can further explore their understanding of the content. Other students in the class prepare questions that explore the character and their conflicts. Students are encouraged to write open-ended questions. Teachers may wish to model hotseating first by acting as the character in the role. Also, the person in the hotseat may have a couple of students who act as their ‚Äúbrain.‚Äù They are there to help answer questions if the person on the hotseat needs them. There are many variations available for this strategy. * Teacher In Role: This strategy is key to involving teacher participation. This strategy can take on many forms. The teacher may take on the role of a character or figure from the event, scene or story. The primary objective of this strategy is to allow students to ask questions and help discover answers to any unresolved issues. The teacher may also choose to immerse themselves in the scene and take on a role while interacting with other characters. The primary role in this situation is to further the evolving drama. * Expert panel: Students themselves become an expert. In order to prepare for this role students must determine what an expert in the area might know. This works well in history or when focusing on broader issues/topics in literature. This strategy can unfold by having students meet as a group of experts or by having students meet in pairs in an interview situation. * Writing in role: A variation on the above strategies, students may also write in character. Often they are asked to imagine themselves as a real or fictitious character in a particular state or situation. Writing in role can take on many forms including a journal, letter, monologue, or newspaper article. This is not meant to be a summary of the story, but instead a further exploration of the character and their interaction with events.

Born in India, he moved to Australia in 1851. He is best known for his engraving View of Melbourne (1865), which was published by De Gruchy and Leigh. Under Thomas Ham he contributed to the Australian Illustrated Magazine. Strafford suffered from mental illness and was committed to Carlton Asylum, Kew Asylum and Yarra Bend Asylum. He continued to draw at Yarra Bend, and became known as 'the mad artist'. He died at Beechworth Asylum in Victoria. His work is held in the British Museum, National Gallery of Victoria and the State Library of Victoria. Life He studied in England under the engraver Edward Goodall. With Goodall‚Äôs sons, Edward the younger and Frederick, he visited France in the early 1840s on a sketching tour. He exhibited paintings of French scenes at London‚Äôs Royal Academy in 1842, 1844 and 1845 and at the British Institution in 1844, at which time he was living at 6 Jeffrey‚Äôs Terrace, Kentish Town. Strafford was acquainted with John Ruskin, who thought so highly of him that he employed him to make designs for his Shield of Achilles. By the mid-1840s he was producing imaginative designs, sketches of Gothic fantasy and visions compared with those by William Blake. In 1847 he married Mary Hemmings in Paris. By the late 1840s Strafford was suffering from hallucinations and showing signs of mental instability, which was evident in his work. His failing health and a weakness in his lungs led to his emigration to Melbourne in 1851 where he was employed by Thomas Ham to produce engraved illustrations ‚Äì The Water Seeker, The Gold Seeker and Gold Digger of Victoria ‚Äì for the Illustrated Australian Magazine. Later he worked for De Gruchy & Leigh, for whom he produced the engraving Melbourne 1856 Taken from the South Side of the Yarra. Samuel Calvert also employed him in the late 1850s, particularly for drawing on wood. At least twelve of his drawings were reproduced as wood-engravings in the Newsletter of Australasia between 1859 and 1861 and the surrounds of the cover illustration used on some issues was also to his design. Mental illness and death Strafford‚Äôs wife died on 21 August 1857, leaving him with no kin in the colony of Australia. By August 1861 his mental instability, accentuated by her death, had increased to such an extent that John J. Mouritz, the Baptist minister of Fitzroy, petitioned for his entry into the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum; he was admitted on 27 September. He was discharged into Mouritz‚Äôs care in December 1864 but after Mouritz‚Äôs death was readmitted on 1 June 1869 on the petition of Samuel Calvert, listed in the asylum records as the patient‚Äôs friend. Strafford was transferred to Carlton Asylum in May 1871, to Kew in June 1873 and to Beechworth on 9 February 1876. He died in the Beechworth Asylum on 13 February 1896, completely forgotten by the Victorian art community. His age at death was given as sixty-six, but he must have been about ten years older since he was exhibiting in the 1840s. Collections Three of Strafford‚Äôs English paintings as well as works by Edward Goodall from Strafford‚Äôs collection were included in the 1869 Melbourne Public Library Art Exhibition. Strafford‚Äôs art collection, including his sketchbooks, was then in the hands of Calvert, who put it up for auction in February 1872. In 1888 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased two of his watercolours for 2 guineas each, St. Paul‚Äôs Church and Old Princes Bridge, in 1854, from East of Swanston Street and Police Station, Richmond Paddock 1854 (now La Trobe Collection, State Library of Victoria, Melbourne). In 1904 Calvert presented four of Strafford‚Äôs works to the British Museum; Design for a fountain 1857, Tritons, Britannia Letting Australia Walk Alone and a watercolour Study of a Boat.

Biography Laut was born in Stanley Township, Huron County, Ontario, to John Laut and wife Eliza George.John Laut, born ca. 1824 in Glasgow, Scotland, had emigrated to Canada and established a merchandising career there.Eliza George, born in the United States ca. 1832, was a daughter of James George, who served as Vice-Principal of Queen's University from 1853 to 1857. In 1873 the family moved to the frontier town of Winnipeg in Manitoba, where Agnes finished normal school when she was fifteen. She worked as a substitute teacher at the Carleton School in Winnipeg for several years then enrolled at the University of Manitoba.At age 15 Laut was too young to apply for a teaching certificate. However, she was forced to drop out after two years due to health problems. She then turned to writing, and was soon published in the New York Evening Press, and the Manitoba Free Press. She also worked as an editorial writer at the Manitoba Free Press from 1895-1897, after which she took two years off to travel the continent from Atlantic to Pacific, paying her way with articles contributed to periodicals. In 1900 she emigrated to the United States, taking residence in Wassaic, New York in 1901. Her first novel, Lords of the North, was published in 1900. After performing research for this and possible follow-on writings, Laut noted the paucity of information covering Canadian history. She decided to address this need by performing research using direct sources then writing on historical subjects. Between 1900‚Äì31 she wrote two dozen books, mainly the topics of the evolution of Canadian territory, the history of Montana, and settlers traveling the Santa Fe Trail. Her novels quickly became popular. Despite moving to America, Laut remained a Canadian nationalist and wrote works intended to teach Americans more about her home country: Canada, the Empire of the North; The Canadian Commonwealth (1909); and Canada at the Cross Roads. Her writing proved popular and she became \\"one of the best-known and prolific historians of her time\\". In 1919, she served as secretary for the Childhood Conservation League, a philanthropic organization intended to help children left homeless following the Mexican Revolution. After traveling to Mexico as a representative of the League, she testified before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations concerning conditions in Mexico. Laut never married.

This ship was originally built as the Cheslakee in Scotland. After Cheslakee capsized in 1913, the hulk was raised, lengthened, and placed back into service as Cheakamus. Nomenclature Cheakamus was named after the Cheakamus River and Cheakamus Canyon which are north of Howe Sound in British Columbia. The original Skwxwu7mesh (Squamish) name is Chiyakmesh or \\"Chehagamus\\", meaning \\"fish trap.\\"Rushton, Echoes of the Whistle, at page 141.  Construction In January 1913 the Union Steamship Company's Cheslakee capsized at the dock at Van Anda, British Columbia on Texada Island, drowning at least seven people. The hulk was raised and brought to North Vancouver, BC, where it was cut in half and a new section inserted, thus extending the vessel's length by slightly less than 20 feet.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at page 69. The ship was renamed Cheakamus and returned to service in June 1913. Cheakamus had a gross tonnage of 689 and net tonnage of 403. The ship was 145.3 feet long, with a beam of 28.1 feet and depth of hold of 17.1 feet.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at page 212. The power plant consisted of a MacColl and Company triple-expansion steam engine.Henry, The Good Company, at page 145. The ship had a speed maximum speed of 12 knots but generally cruised at 10.5 knots. Unlike the Cheslakee, the Cheakamus was stable in heavy seas.Henry, The Good Company, at page 51. The ship was licensed to carry 148 passengers. The ship had a cargo capacity of about 120 tons. The official Canadian registry number was 130309.The New Mills' List, ‚ÄúRegistered Canadian Steamships 1817-1930 over 75 feet‚Äù (accessed 05-18-13). Operations Originally Cheakamus was used on freight and passenger routes with the Cassiar until 1925 when the newly built Cardena and Catala took over these duties.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 564. After that Cheakamus was primarily used to provide service to coastal logging camps.Henry, The Good Company, at page 146. In August 1917, Cheakamus was assigned to the route from Vancouver to Alert Bay when the normal vessel on the route, Cassiar struck a rock at Kingcome Inlet and sank.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at pages 77-78/ In the late 1930s, the company modernized the passenger accommodations on Cheakamus with the objective of using the vessel on more routes.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at page 133. Transfer to U.S. Army When the United States entered the Second World War in December 1941, there arose a big demand for barge service to Alaska. In 1942, Cheakamus was converted to a towboat.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at page 141. The ship was then purchased by the U.S. Army and used in war transport until the end of the war. The ship was then sold as war surplus to Arthur Foss of the Foss Tug concern. End of service In 1949, Foss donated the Cheakamus to the Puget Sound Maritime Historical Society for use as a floating headquarters and museum. However the society decided that the maintenance costs for the vessel would be too great and turned it over for scrapping.

Chubb was the son of Charles Archibald Chubb (1871-1967), and the great-great grandson of Charles Chubb (1772‚Äì1845), who had founded Chubb and Sons Lock and Safe Co. He was the last family chairman of the company and also a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords. Business career Chubb joined the family firm in 1931 learning the skills of lock-making in the Wolverhampton factory, and then worked in sales at the firm's St James's Street branch. He became managing director in 1941 and chairman in 1957. He played a major part in the post-war expansion of the company from a highly specialised family concern to a diversified international business. He travelled to Australia, Canada and South Africa to open new businesses. During his chairmanship he oversaw acquisitions and expansion which took Chubb into a broad range of products, including fire protection equipment. The group's workforce grew from 700 to 17,000, in 17 countries. He retired in 1981. Politics When he succeeded to the barony in 1967, he sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords. He made his maiden speech on the role of locks and safes in crime prevention. This was in stark contrast to his father, who had never made a speech in 21 years of attending the House. He became deputy chairman in 1981 after retiring from Chubb. In 1986 he emerged as a leader of a coalition of peers who opposed the abolition of the Greater London Council. Although unsuccessful this reinforced his position as a deputy chairman (or deputy speaker). He disappeared from the House along with most other hereditary peers following the reforms brought about by the House of Lords Act 1999. Awards He was invested as CBE in 1976 and KCVO in 1977. Personal life Chubb was educated at The Leys School, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read history, graduating in 1932 with an MA. He married Elizabeth Anne Rumbold MBE, only daughter of Thomas Arthur Rumbold and Rosemary Hazel Hampshire, on 28 March 1940. They had four children; the eldest son and heir was Hon. George William Michael Chubb, born 9 October 1943. He succeeded to the titles of 3rd Baronet Chubb, of Newlands and 3rd Baron Hayter, of Chislehurst in the County of Kent, on the death of his father on 3 March 1967. He had a wide range of outside interests; from 1965 to 1982 he was chairman of the management committee of the King's Fund, he championed the development of the 'King's Fund bed', an adaptable design which became the standard in British hospitals; he was chairman of the Design Council. the Royal Society of Arts, the Duke of Edinburgh's \\"Countryside in 1970\\" committee and the British Security Industry Association. He was also president of the Royal Warrant Holders' Association, the Business Equipment Trade Association and the Canada-UK Chamber of Commerce. He served as upper bailiff of the Worshipful Company of Weavers where he actively supported the admission of women liverymen. He died on 2 September 2003, aged 92, and was succeeded to the barony by his eldest son, George William Michael Chubb. As of 31 July 2012 the claimed present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.

Design and construction Camosun was the first passenger-freighter ship ordered by the Union Steamship Company of British Columbia.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, pp. 45‚Äì48. The vessel was intended to compete against the ships of two rival concerns, of the Canadian Pacific, and and of the Boscowitz Company.Henry, The Good Company, pp. 33‚Äì37. Construction on the vessel began in the spring of 1904 at the Bow McLachlan & Co. shipyard in Paisley, Scotland.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History, pp. 114, 127, 227. Later it was said that construction on Camosun had begun with the objective of completing a tugboat for service on the Hooghly River in India, but when that contract fell through, the ship was completed to the order of the Union Steamship Company. The official Canadian registry number was 121204.The New Mills' List, ‚ÄúRegistered Canadian Steamships 1817‚Äì1930 over 75 feet‚Äù (accessed 06-17-11). Camosun had a gross tonnage of 1,369 and net tonnage of 793. The ship was long, with a beam of and depth of hold of .Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, p. 210. The hull was strongly built of steel, with a double bottom in the bow and the stern. The power plant consisted of twin triple-expansion steam engines, rated at 224 nominal horsepower. Steam was generated by two boilers.Henry, The Good Company, p. 145. These were originally coal-fired, and later converted to oil. The ship had a speed maximum speed of but generally cruised at . The ship had 54 first class berths and 120 deck bunks. The main first class cabins were located on the upper deck together with lounges fore and aft. There was a smoking room as well as additional cabins on the aft top deck, on which the pilot house and officers' quarters were located on fore part of the top deck. The ship had a dining saloon on the main deck. The ship had a cargo capacity of about 300 tons. Delivery Camosun left Troon, Scotland on February 19, 1905 under the command of Captain B.L. Johnson for delivery to British Columbia. The ship initially proceeded to Kingston, Jamaica, where command was changed over to Capt. C.B. Smith. The ship then proceeded around Cape Horn to the west coast of North America, where the vessel halted at San Francisco, California, for one month to caulk the decks. Camosun finally arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia on June 20, 1905. Repairs necessary to Camosun following the delivery voyage brought Union Steamship into litigation with the ship's builders. Operations Camosun became the flagship of the Union Steamship fleet, and was placed into service by the Union Steamship Company on July 4, 1905. The vessel had a license to carry 199 passengers on coastal voyages, and had a crew of 38. The initial route on which the vessel was placed ran from Vancouver to Stewart, British Columbia via Alert Bay, Bella Coola, Bella Bella, Port Essington, the Skeena River, Port Simpson and the Nass River. Prince Rupert did not then exist, and the ship anchored at a landing float at Stewart, as no wharf had yet been built there. When Prince Rupert was founded, in 1906, Camosun was the first passenger ship to call at the new port. The harbor at Prince Rupert had not been fully surveyed, and in July 1906, Camosun struck a rock in the harbor. The vessel would have sunk, but was saved by the double-bottom design. As a result, service was disrupted by the need transfer Camosun to Victoria, British Columbia, where the vessel underwent repairs at Joseph Spratt's shipyard. Within 18 months of entering service, Camosun was equipped with a Marconi wireless transmitter, becoming the first vessel on the Canadian Pacific coast to be so equipped. The first master of Camosun in operations was Frank Saunders. Echo location using the ships horn was used to navigate by night or in foggy weather, and for his skill in this, Frank Saunders was known as the \\"fog wizard\\". Robert Batchelor, an experienced ocean-going seaman, took over as master when Captain Saunders left to command the ships of Canada National. The fish packing industry was increasing in importance when Camosun came into service. Every spring Camosun transported several hundred Chinese, Japanese, and Indiana workers to the twenty-five packing plants that were on Smith's Inlet, Rivers Inlet and the Skeena and Nass rivers. The ship also transported out packed and frozen fish during the peak of the canning season, which ran from July to October. Once in October 1907, Camosun returned to Vancouver with 6,000 cases of canned salmon, the largest such shipment ever landed at Vancouver up to that time. Camosun was considered a fast and reliable vessel of the time, being able to make the run from Prince Rupert to Vancouver in 45 hours under Captain Saunders. In the fall of 1906, Camosun transported the crew of the wrecked sternwheeler from the Skeena River to Vancouver. Pheasant had been lost when the provincial government chartered the steamboat to clear the channel in the Skeena. On November 21, 1906, the sternwheeler's engines had broken down, and the powerless vessel drifted upon some rocks in mid-stream. Having reached shore, the Pheasants crew was picked up by Camosun. In 1907, there were gold strikes in the Portland Canal area. Servicing these strikes became a profitable business for the Camosun.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, pp. 50‚Äì53. In 1909, the Union Steamship company acquired a mail contract. Other cargo carried at this time included fifty head of cattle carried on the foredeck. In 1912, Camosun was converted from coal-fired to oil-fired boilers, the high cost of which was offset by the ease and cleanliness of refueling compared to the use of coal bunkers.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, p. 63. In early January 1913, Camosun proceeded to Van Anda, on Texada Island to transport 71 survivors from the capsize of , another Union steamship.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, pp. 67‚Äì69 Grounding Camosun ashore on Digby Island, March, 1916. On March 7, 1916, at 2:00 am, while en route to Masset, Camosun under the command of Capt. A.E. Dickson, was moving at one-quarter speed through a heavy snow storm. The ship went aground near Prince Rupert harbor, at Digby Island.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at page 73. At low tide the vessel was completely clear of the water. The seventeen passengers on board were removed by rescue vessels which had come from Prince Rupert. To lighten the ship to allow it to float free at high tide, cargo bound for the Queen Charlotte Islands, including 100 tons of coal, was off-loaded into smaller transshipment vessels. Camosuns strongly built hull allowed the ship to remain on the rock without damage until March 17, when the ship was finally got off under its own power. The damage from the grounding turned out to be minor. Later service and fate Camosun continued in service. On January 23, 1923, Camosun sustained minor damage in a collision with the Canadian Pacific's coastal liner .Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, p. 92. The collision occurred off Kingcome Point in the Grenville Channel as Camosun was proceeding southbound from Prince Rupert. Damage to Camosun was minor, and both ships continued their voyages afterwards. In another incident in the same winter, Camosun went aground briefly in a fog near Brockton Point in Vancouver's Stanley Park. The Vancouver Fire Department responded to the scene, and removed passengers by use of their fire ladders. Camosun was a heavy vessel with a lot of momentum, and had to be slowed down well before landings. Shortly after World War I, when Camosun was under the command of a captain who was unfamiliar with the vessel, the captain failed to give the order to reduce speed in time, and so Camosun crashed through a dock at the Rivers Inlet cannery, going right up into the cannery building itself. In 1935 Camosun was sold for scrap.Rushton, Whistle up the Inlet, p. 128.

Lady Cynthia was a sistership to Lady Cecilia, also a converted minesweeper. The ship was generally referred to as the Cynthia while in service. Nomenclature The Union Steamship Company of British Columbia, owners of Lady Cynthia, had a number of vessels which operated in all areas of the coast of British Columbia. The company however ran a number of routes close to Vancouver where overnight accommodations on board ship would be unnecessary, with the objective being to carry large numbers of day passengers. To distinguish vessels intended for this service from the company's other ships, these day vessels were given names that began with \\"Lady\\".Henry, The Good Company, at page 103. Design and construction Lady Cynthia was originally built in 1919 as a Hunt class minesweeper and served with the Royal Navy as HMS Barnstaple. The navy sold the minesweeper in 1924, and it was purchased by the Union Steamship Company of British Columbia.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at pages 101-102. The vessel was reconstructed at the shipyard of Coaster Construction Co., under the management of W.D. McLaren, in Montrose, Scotland. An upper deck was added, and to maintain the ship's stability, sponsons were added on each side of the hull. The sponsons reduced the maximum speed of the ship from 19 to 15 knots. The rebuilt ship had two funnels but the rear funnel was a dummy, added for appearance only. Lady Cynthia had a gross tonnage of 950 and net tonnage of 390. The ship was 219.3 feet long, with a beam of 28.6 feet and depth of hold of 16.3 feet. The power plant consisted of twin triple-expansion steam engines and two Yarrow water tube boilers. The ship had twin propellers.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at pages 365, 368, 575, and 630. The maximum speed was about 15.5 knots but this required firing of both boilers and was reserved for special occasions. Normal speed was 13 knots, and one boiler was sufficient for this. The ship was licensed for a maximum of 900 passengers on summer excursions, 800 passengers in other summer travel, and 500 passengers during the winter.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at page 214. Cargo capacity was approximately 75 tons. The official Canadian registry number was 152899.The New Mills' List, ‚ÄúRegistered Canadian Steamships 1817-1930 over 75 feet‚Äù (accessed 05-18-13). Entry into passenger operations Following reconstruction Lady Cynthia reached Vancouver BC on August 22, 1925. The company placed the ship on the route from Vancouver to Powell River under Capt. Alfred E. Dickson, the company's most senior master for the first trip. Afterwards Capt. John Boden was placed in command. Starting in the 1920s, Lady Cynthia was employed on excursions to Bowen Island, where Union Steamship had owned and operated a popular resort.Rushton, Echo of the Whistle, at pages 48 and 55. Collision with Cowichan On December 27, 1925, Lady Cynthia collided with another Union company steamship, the Cowichan, which resulted in the sinking of the Cowichan. The collision occurred when a third Union ship, the Lady Cecilia had brought a Christmas excursion of mostly lumber mill workers from Powell River to Vancouver. Other passengers had come from the north over the holiday, and the numbers returning to Vancouver exceeded Cecilia's capacity. Harold Brown, the company's general manager, had ordered that Lady Cynthia be held on standby with steam up in such an event, and the additional 200 passengers beyond the 400 on Cecilia were embarked on Cynthia. Meanwhile, Cowichan was coming south under Captain Robert Wilson and encountered fog off Roberts Creek. Captain Wilson was proceeding slowly, listening carefully for the sound of Cecilias whistle. Cecilia passed safely by, but then Wilson was taken by surprise 15 minutes later when Cynthia, under Captain John Boden appeared out of the fog, striking Cowichan bow-on amidships. Captain Boden shouted down from Cynthia 's bridge that he would hold the bow into Cowichan to keep Cowichan from sinking. There were only 45 people on board Cowichan, including 31 crew. Captain Wilson of the Cowichan helped all of them board onto Cecilia's foredeck. Captain Wilson was the last to leave Cowichan. When he stepped onto Cecilia, he called out to Captain Boden:\\"Pull her out now, Cap, or she'll take us down with her.\\" When Cecila backed away, Cowichan sank almost immediately.  Later service  In late May 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Vancouver. They departed on May 29, 1939 on board the Canadian Pacific steamer Princess Marguerite. Lady Cynthia and five other Union steamships embarked 2,500 passengers between them to accompany the Princess Margarite, with the royal party on board, as far as Point Atkinson.Rushton, Whistle Up the Inlet, at pages 135 and 139-140. The superstructure of the Lady Cynthia was reconstructed in 1940, and the dummy after funnel was removed. Overnight cabins were constructed to allow the ship to serve more remote logging camps. War time operations War was declared in September 1939. All the ships of the Union company operated under limited running lights at night, and all portholes were blacked out. Radio silence was maintained, and later anti-mine equipment and anti-aircraft guns would be added to the ships. During the war, the Union company's ships, including Lady Cynthia, engaged in \\"Win the War Cruises\\" carrying purchasers of war bonds, with the officers and men donating their time. Gasoline shortages also encouraged people who would otherwise have used their automobiles to take short boat trips on Lady Cynthia to Bowen Island or Howe Sound for recreation. Post-war service In September 1948, another Union steamship, the cruise vessel Chilcotin, while returning to Vancouver, near Texada Island became disabled by machinery failure. Lady Cynthia was dispatched, picked up the 102 passengers, members of an American Shrine group, and transported them to Vancouver, where they could make their connections with trains and airplanes for return to their homes.Rushton, Whistle up the Inlet, at pages 158-162. In August 1950, Lady Cynthia collided with the Canadian Forestry Service motor launch A.L. Bryant off Bowen Island. The forestry launch was cut in two. Of the seven men on board the launch, three were lost and four were rescued. Union Steamship began encountering serious competition in the late 1940s and early 1950s, from the automobile and from auto-carrying ferries. After 1951, although the company kept ships on some of the more distant routes, only the Lady Cynthia remained in year-round service in the Gulf of Georgia, running from Vancouver to Squamish, BC, in Howe Sound, where there was a connection to the Pacific Great Eastern Railway. On October 28, 1953, Lady Cynthia rammed and sank the tug Dora. Although the tug sank in five minutes, the nine-man crew of the Dora was taken on board the Cynthia and no one was lost. At the time, Dora had been towing a railway barge with rail cars for the Squamish rail connection.Rushton, Whistle up the Inlet, at page 175. On July 3, 1955, the Union Steamship Company was hit with a labor strike, which tied up its vessels for most of the summer season which the company depended upon for much of its revenue.Rushton, Whistle up the Inlet, at pages 178 to 181. In September 1955, once the strike was settled, the company did not return Lady Cynthia to the Squamish route. Withdrawal from service In 1956, the Pacific Great Eastern Railway completed a rail link from Squamish to North Vancouver, and there was no further need for the marine connection with the railway which had once been served by Lady Cynthia. Lady Cynthia was withdrawn from service and partially dismantled in Vancouver. The hull was sold to Glazer and Sternoff Metals, a Seattle scrap metal concern. On October 3, 1957, the hull was towed out of Vancouver harbor bound for Seattle to be scrapped.

Hallman was a candidate for State Treasurer of Arizona in the Republican primary on August 26, 2014, but lost to Jeff DeWit.http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Hugh_Hallman#cite_note-bio-1 Hallman is a community activist, volunteer, and lifelong resident of Tempe. His background as a public servant, teacher, economist, and attorney has allowed him to design public programs and policies locally, nationally, and internationally.http://hughhallman.com/about.htm Early life and education Hallman is the son of Evelyn Hallman (n√©e Evelyn Rose Chapman), a seamstress, diesel mechanic, and longtime Tempe community activist; and Louis, a retired high school math teacher and football, basketball and wrestling coach, among other sports.http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/1453534/ His mother, whose early political activities included volunteering for the presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater, was honored in 2006 for her local preservation efforts in North Tempe when Canal Park was renamed Evelyn Hallman Park. Hugh graduated from Coronado High School (Scottsdale, Arizona) and was admitted to Claremont Men's College in California, but studied at Arizona State University in the Honors Program (now the Barrett Honors College) for his first year. He then transferred to Claremont, where he majored in economics and political science and minored in accounting. He eventually became president of the student government and graduated summa cum laude in 1984. Hallman earned his J.D. from the University of Chicago Law School in 1988, where he graduated with Honors and Order of the Coif.http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2008-07-03/news/tempe-mayor-hugh-hallman- isn-t-afraid-to-step-on-a-few-toes-as-he-waltzes-into-his-second- term/full/#livefyre Professional career Hallman began his legal career as an associate at the law firm of Brown and Bain, where he worked in the fields of domestic and international finance and taxation, intellectual property and anti-trust. Later he became a partner in the firm Colombo & Bonacci until he established his own firm, Hallman and Affiliates, in 1999 where he has dealt with a broad range of legal issues for individual and corporate clients. As an economist, Hallman has worked with colleagues at Stanford, Harvard, MIT, and the University of Chicago in analyzing markets and competition in various industries. Educator In addition to being a past lecturer at Arizona State University and East-Kazakhstan State University, Hallman is a visiting professor and founder of the Kazakh-American Free University (KAFU) in Ust- Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Hallman was invited to tour the former Soviet republics. His subsequent partnership with the former Minister of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Dr. Erezhep Mambetkaziyev, led to the creation of KAFU, which today serves thousands of students in the fields of business, law, and education. In 2009 Hallman put his law practice on hiatus to become headmaster of Tempe Preparatory Academy, an independent public charter school where he had served as general counsel. Hallman's three sons have attended the school. Political career Hugh's political career began at age 2 when he accompanied his mother to events for Barry Goldwater presidential campaign in 1964. Prior to graduating from Claremont, Hallman took a position in Ronald Reagan's campaign as a deputy assistant to the national campaign director. He took a deferral from the University of Chicago, where he had been accepted, to complete his service to the Reagan-Bush '84 campaign. He then took time off from politics to enter law school, but returned to the political arena a few years later when his experience helping local activists preserve Tempe Beach Park led to his successful run for a seat on the Tempe City Council. Hallman ran for mayor of Tempe in 2004 but was considered an outsider even by his Republican colleagues. His success in the hotly contested campaign marked a change in Tempe politics, and during his first term he positioned himself as a \\"reformer\\". His primary goals were to attract new development for the city and establish sound fiscal policies while strengthening essential city services such as police and fire. As a pro-business and pro-development mayor who frequently crossed the aisle to achieve his goals, the Arizona Republic referred to him as \\"one of those rare public officials who meticulously connects the dots\\". Hallman won re-election in 2008 without formal opposition. During his second term he also served as Chairman of the Maricopa Association of Governments, and has been an ardent champion of cooperative development and improved international trade with Mexico given his long experience in the field. Additional community activities Hallman has been involved with numerous local charities such as East Valley Habitat for Humanity, Assistance for Independent Living, Tempe Community Action Agency, and the Boy Scouts of America. He was the president of the Rio Salado Foundation and spearheaded efforts to preserve Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's former Phoenix residence, which was moved to the Arizona Historical Society grounds and now serves as a center for national and international problem solving and policy initiatives. Writings by Hugh Hallman In addition to numerous editorials and essays, Hallman has written four business texts. They are How to Do Business in Kazakhstan, published in 1999 with a second edition published in 2004; its companion text, How to Do Business in the United States, which is a Russian language text; and How to Do Business in Sonora and its companion Spanish language text Como Hacer Negocios En Arizona, the latter two of which he co- authored in support of Arizona's effort to build successful cross-border trade with Mexico and create jobs for Arizonans. Awards and recognition Hallman is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including Arizona Charter School Association \\"Leader of the Year\\"; Alzheimer's Association Leadership Award; League of United Latin American Citizens Citizenship Award; JAG National \\"Above & Beyond the Call\\" Service Award; and the East Valley Partnership \\"Lifetime Achievement Award.\\" Personal Hallman's wife, Susan, whom he met at the University of Chicago, is a physician specializing in internal medicine. Together they have three sons. An avid runner, Hallman primarily competes in half marathons. Hallman organized the annual Mayor's Run, which has raised over $1.3 million for local charities.

J. and M. R. Penskar. 1999. Special plant abstract for Leymus mollis (American dune wild-rye). Michigan Natural Features Inventory, Lansing, MI. and strand grass. Its Japanese name is hamaninniku.Plant propagation protocol for Leymus mollis ssp. mollis. Propagation Protocols for Pacific Northwest Plants. University of Washington. 2008. It is native to Asia, where it occurs in Japan, China, Korea, and Russia, and northern parts of North America, where it occurs across Canada and the northern United States, as well as Greenland. It can also be found in Iceland. Growth patterns This is a rhizomatous perennial grass with erect stems growing up to 1.7 meters tall. The leaf blades can be nearly a meter long in ssp. mollis, and up to 1.5 centimeters wide. The flower spike is up to 34 centimeters long by 2 wide. Each spikelet may be up to 3.4 centimeters long and contain up to six florets. There are two subspecies. Subspecies villosissimus is mostly limited to arctic regions, and is mainly coastal. It is usually a smaller plant than ssp. mollis.Leymus mollis. Grass Manual Treatment. The two subspecies are otherwise hard to tell apart, even when growing sympatrically. The most reliable character to use to distinguish them is the type of hairs on the glumes and lemmas;Aiken, S. G., et al. 2007. Leymus mollis ssp. villosissima. Flora of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Descriptions, Illustrations, Identification, and Information Retrieval. NRC Research Press, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa. ssp. villosissimus has long, soft, sometimes shaggy hairs (villous), while ssp. mollis has fine, thin hairs (pilose), and generally fewer of them. There is no awn. Habitat This grass usually grows in coastal habitat, especially on dunes. It can be an important part of dune ecology. The grass usually grows on the foredune and on embryo dunes, less often on the backdune.Goodman, T. Report on revegetation with Leymus mollis on the foredune at Ma-l‚Äôel Dunes Unit, Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge. US Fish and Wildlife Service. Arcata, California. June, 2009. It is one of the first plants to establish in the process of ecological succession in the early stages of the development of a sand dune. In these loose dunes facing the ocean the plants tolerate salt spray, salty sand, little to no fresh water, unstable substrates, occasional inundation during storms, low nutrient levels, and abrasion by wind, water, and ice storms. Seedlings may become buried. This type of environment causes stress in a plant. The grass grows from a large rhizome that anchors it into shifting and unstable sands. When there are many plants on a dune, their rhizomes form a network that helps to stabilize it, preventing erosion. The network becomes \\"the skeleton of the foredune.\\" This makes the grass a valuable species for landscape rehabilitation in native beach habitat. Other plants Other plants that occur with the grass include Lathyrus japonicus, Achillea millefolium, Festuca rubra, Ammophila breviligulata, Rhus typhina, Rosa rugosa, and Arctanthemum arcticum. It also grows with mosses such as Pleurozium shreberi and Polytrichum spp. and lichens such as Cladina spp. It was observed to be one of the most common plants in the arctic nesting sites of the snow goose. It is thought that the geese prefer the overall ecosystem that hosts the grass, rather than favoring the grass itself. Genetic hybridization Leymus mollis has been studied for possible usage in the science of wheat breeding. Wide hybridization of wheat and L. mollis has been conducted successfully since the 1960s to generate many hybrids. An important example of L. mollis hybridization with wheat occurred when the AD99 L. mollis line was hybridized with wheat. The AD99 was resistant to powdery mildew, and the resultant wheat hybrid yielded six lines that were also resistant to powdery mildew. This experiment can be used as a basis for L. mollis to be considered as a very useful genetic resource. By using Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) it was found that wheat has a complex and redundant genome. ESTs serve to identify transcribed parts of the genome. Through a comparative study it was found that L. mollis has some of these genes as well; because they are highly conserved. These genes are more prominent in L. mollis than wheat however, and are used for osmotic and drought stress tolerance. Due to their similarity though, they have the ability to be hybridized into wheat. Overall these ESTs help to provide proper tools for molecular markers to help identify possible introgression of genes into wheat, particularly in regards to osmotic stress tolerance. Leymus mollis' relative success with wheat breading can be demonstrated specifically by utilizing the Genetic In-Situ Hybridization (GISH) method. Comparative GISH showed that the genomes in the genus Leymus are fairly diverse. However, it was also found that chromosomes of species within this genus were able to undergo complete meiotic paring in hybridism with each other. Using the GISH technique, it was found that differences in sub-telomeric heterochromatin do not affect meiotic pairing. Because of this it can be understood that the differences between Leymus genus and Triticum (wheat) would not prevent successful hybridization. This conclusion results from the fact that Leymus is already able to overcome differences within its own genus in pairing. Adaptability Leymus mollis is generally looked at for hybridization due to it being highly adaptable and robust. To determine this adaptable nature of L. mollis, its seedlings were studied in an environment in which there was low nutrient availability. In this environment, the seedlings were very tolerant of the low nutrients and were still able to sprout. Generally, low soil moisture is considered to be an important mortality factor, yet L. mollis seedlings were able to survive successfully. The period of drought that these seedlings were tested in was 5 successive days, and L. mollis had a survival rate of 93%. This adaptability of the plant is something that is not seen in wheat seedlings, which is why it is looked at for hybridization. Being a dune grass, L. mollis also has an extensive ability to survive salinity. The viability of these seeds in the salinity was found to be higher than fifty percent following submergence for seven days. This is translatable to L. mollis being able to grow in soil with high salt content. The surrounding soil may not be viable for traditional plants, however L. mollis still retains the ability to grow. This further demonstrates the wide adaptability of L. mollis. As a result of strong anthropogenic pressures in today‚Äôs world, one response is to look at sustainable development of our vegetative environment. Biologists are continuously looking for new ways to combat these artificial pressures, and one of the species that has potential to be more closely looked at is Leymus mollis, an extremely adaptable plant species. Specific traits of L. mollis can be proven beneficial in the hybridization and domestication of this species or a hybrid species. These traits include the species‚Äô ability to tolerate moderate burial intensity and sustain trampling, adapt to drought and water deficiency, resist many fungal diseases such as wheat stripe rust, contain high rhizome bud viability, and tolerate salt and various diseases. Drought tolerance: The first environmental stress factor that L. mollis exhibits tolerance to is drought and water deficiency. This wild relative of wheat has defense mechanisms that express several stress-responsive genes that allow the species to tolerate drought and water deficiency. These genetic factors leading to the adaptability of L. mollis to water deficiencies can be beneficial in artificial selection and hybridization. Burial tolerance: Although Leymus mollis adapts well to moderate and high drought intensities, it has shown to have even a greater tolerance for moderate burial intensity and sustain the trampling present in North American subarctic environments.Boudreau, S., & Faure-Lacroix, J. (2009). Tolerance to sand burial, trampling, and drought of two subarctic coastal plant species (Leymus mollis and Trisetum spicatum). Arctic, 418-428. Fungal disease resistance: In addition to these tolerance factors, Leymus mollis is also resistant to many fungal diseases. One example of this tolerance is with wheat stripe rust, a plant infection caused by Puccinia striiformis. As one of the most widely distributed and destructive fungal diseases in the world, many wheat crops today need new effective resistance genes and development of new resistance germplasms. Multiple types of translocation wheat lines that possess resistance to multiple different races of stripe rust fungus have been found.Li, H., Fan, R., Fu, S., Wei, B., Xu, S., Feng, J., ... & Zhang, X. (2015). Development of Triticum aestivum-Leymus mollis Translocation Lines and Identification of Resistance to Stripe Rust. Journal of genetics and genomics= Yi chuan xue bao, 42(3), 129. Rhizome bud viability: The strong rhizome bud viability of L. mollis also contributes to the species‚Äô adaptability. Leymus mollis rhizomes have potential to spread and colonize a large distance from a source population due to their bud‚Äôs ability to survive in seawater during seawater submergence. Although L. mollis does not have as brittle of rhizomes as some species native to the same areas, such as Ammophilia arenaria, and therefore does not break into rhizome fragments as easily, many other rhizomes have a lower viability than L. mollis rhizomes.Rachel, A., & Marcel, R. (2000). The effect of sea-water submergence on rhizome bud viability of the introduced Ammophila arenaria and the native Leymus mollis in California. J Coast Conserv Journal of Coastal Conservation, 107-111. Salt tolerance and disease resistance: The genes for salt tolerance and disease resistance are also naturally found in L. mollis. In addition, this species has large spikes, strong rhizomes, and experiences vigorous growth in environments ranging from Siberia to Canada and Iceland and the northern parts of Japan. All of these traits of L. mollis have the potential to be beneficial for crop improvement and domestication of new plant species in response to anthropogenic pressures and the increased need for food production. Human uses Tlingit twined basket tray, late 19th c., spruce root, American dunegrass, pigment, Cleveland Museum of Art This grass has had a number of other uses. In addition to possible wheat breeding, the drought resistance of L. mollis is suggested to be used in restoration initiatives. The Makah, Nitinaht, and Quileute used bunches of the thick roots to rub the body during bathing. Yupik peoples use the leaves to make mats, baskets, bags, and ropes for hanging fish to dry. The Hesquiat weave the leaves into handles for sacks. The Kwakwaka'wakw make baskets and hats from the leaves and traditionally have used them to line the boxes in which they cooked lupine roots. The Nitinaht used the pointed leaves to sew and tie. The Haisla and Hanaksiala used the grass to line pits in which they prepared the oil of the eulachon fish. The Quinault placed salal fruits on a bed of the leaves to dry.Leymus mollis. Native American Ethnobotany Database. University of Michigan, Dearborn. Inuit in Canada have traditionally used Leymus mollis to treat stomach problems and to weave baskets. They used dried leaves to insulate their boots.Clark, Courtenay. \\"Inuit ethnobotany and ethnoecology in Nunavik and Nunatsiavut, northeastern Canada.\\" Universit√© de Montr√©al. Dec 2012: 25.

Concerns include development, storm damage, and the impact of recreational activities. In some areas it has been displaced by introduced species of plants, such as Ammophila arenaria. Cultivars available include 'Reeve' and 'Benson'. The latter was named for Benny Benson, the thirteen-year-old boy who designed the official flag of Alaska.

The genus is endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. The name means ‚Äúlittle trouble-maker‚Äù, given with reference to the initial difficulties of placing V. latebrosa within the family. All species are shrubs which occur in dry fynbos habitats on the fringes of the Succulent Karoo ecoregion. The inflorescences are similar to those of the related leucospermums but also share features of the leucadendrons, with the floral bracts becoming woody and enlarged following pollination. The flowers are insect-pollinated, with the seeds dispersed by ants (myrmecochory).  Description  Vexators are upright or spreading evergreen shrubs with alternately set, narrow, spade-shaped leaves ending bluntly in a bony tip, with an entire margin, and greyish or bluish in colour. The stalked flower heads are mostly set individually, sometimes with two to six together at the end of the stems, opening from the center outwards. The individual flowers are 4-merous, star symmetrical and hermaphrodite. The four perianth segments are pink or cream-coloured, and have a sweet smell. From their center, a straight style emerges that is hairless or powdery. The thickened part at its tip called pollen presenter is cleft at its tip. The ovary is egg- to bottle-shaped, consists of one carpel and contains just one cavity with one hanging primordial seed. The ovary is subtended by four free awl-shaped scales. The fruit is an egg-shaped hairless or powdery achene, that is beaked at its tip, and blunt and wrinkly at its base. The bracteoles that support the individual flowers become woody after flowering, a character that set Vexatorella apart from Leucospermum except for L. secundifolium that also develops woody bracteoles.  Taxonomy  Comparison of homologous DNA has increased the insight in the phylogenetic relationships between the Proteaceae. Vexatorella belongs to a group that (except for Leucospermum saxosum) further only consists of genera endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, that together constitute the subtribe Leucadendrinae. Vexatorella is the closest relative of Paranomus. The genera Sorocephalus and Spatalla are the sister group to the Vexatorella and Paranomus. The following trees together represent those insights. The described subtaxa are: * Vexatorella alpina (Salisb. ex Knight) Rourke ‚Äì Kamiesberg vexator * Vexatorella amoena (Rourke) Rourke ‚Äì Swartruggens vexator * Vexatorella latebrosa Rourke ‚Äì Robertson vexator * Vexatorella obtusata (Thunb.)

V. alpina is thought to be a near-threatened species. Vexatorella latebrosa on the other hand regarded as being critically endangered.

She worked to legitimise women's sports in a time when there was societal trend to trivialise it. Birth and education Quarrell was born at Corryton, South Australia on 19 November 1914. She was the second of five children of Alfred James and Lottie May (n√©e Overington) Quarrell. She was educated at Adelaide Technical High School, where she also played hockey and cricket, and was captain of the senior basketball team. Early career She began her work as a journalist at age 17, in 1932 and began sports writing in 1935. She was one of the first female sports journalists in Australia; one of three in the nation in the 1930s and the first to write for The Advertiser, Adelaide‚Äôs daily newspaper. Quarrell's work regularly identified and recognised the skill of South Australia's early pioneers in women's sport including Australian representatives Mabel Cashmore and Evelyn Tazewell in hockey, Netballers Gwen Rankin and Lorna Ryan, Cricketers Dot Laughton and Barbara Orchard and the state's first female Olympian, swimmer Denise Norton. Her column regularly covered a wide range of sports including table tennis, softball, cricket, hockey, netball, tennis, sailing, surf life saving, equestrian and rowing. In an age without digital technology, Quarrell rode her bike to sporting events across Adelaide to watch and report on them. Quarrell contributed a half-page column in The Advertiser from 1936 devoted entirely to women in sport; their issues, skill and achievements, often in the face of crushing societal criticism of their natural ability and their expected roles. She used her influence in the media to encourage women to be involved in sports and to administer their own sporting organisations. She strongly argued for the inclusion of 'games' for girls in the school curriculum, against opposition who believed that girls playing sport would rob them of their femininity. Other issues she created debate about through her work in the media and involvement in sports administration within the state included sport and motherhood, the restrictions of sports uniforms on participation. Contribution to women's sports Quarrell played a key role during the '30s in the development of women's sports in South Australia, making it her business to speak up within an industry reluctant to cover the topic. As an active sportswoman herself, she provided diverse and learned insight into the motivation, commitment, efforts and achievements of sports throughout South Australia. Her work in the media highlighted the plethora of opportunities for women to be involved in sport from grassroots to international levels in a variety of roles and capacities. Quarrell used her work to protest against and ridicule the paternalism of sport's governing bodies and helped women's sports to become self-governing. Her work helped to highlight role models, opportunity and the real social issues and expectations which impacted on women of the time. Yet Quarrell's great challenge to how women's sport is valued and reported in the mainstream media remains despite the social movements of the '60s and '70s and equal opportunity laws focussed on removing discrimination based on gender. While some gains were made in the '80s and '90s, in the current media climate women's sports receives limited and often narrowly focused coverage in the traditional commercial mainstream media in Australia. The Crawford Report reported \\"of 50 NSOs the panel consulted only 15 had a female CEO or executive director. Of the 350 board positions in these organizations, only 25% are held by women. With roughly the same number of participants in sport, it would be realistic goal to have closer to 50% representation of women in these leadership roles\\". Many of the women's sport specific organisations Quarrell's work helped to establish in South Australia were disbanded as sports chose to merge men and women's sports association and it can be argued that this change has been at the detriment of the profile and opportunities for women in sport. A movement begun in 2013, by high-profile South Australian sportswoman Jenny Williams seeks to use digital media technology to reignite the debate and the raise the profile of women's sports past and present in South Australia. Carrying on in the spirit of Lois Quarrell and the fine work during the '80s and '90s of female sports journalists such as Marg Ralston and Tanya Lewis, the South Australian Women's Sports Network provides access to news, history, sports reports and achievements of South Australian sportswomen not widely recognised in mainstream traditional media. The Advertiser journalist Ben Hook acknowledged this work by promoting the site in a sports article in May 2013.

In 1126, Meng was made a refugee from Kaifeng, the thriving capital of the Northern Song Dynasty after Jurchen Jin invaders conquered northern China and forced the withdrawal of the Song court to the temporary capital, Hangzhou, in the south, then known as Lin'an. Meng's book is a detailed and nostalgic description of the old capital's urban life, seasonal products, and festivals, as well as foods, customs, and traditions. In later dynasties, the book was much imitated and taken as an authoritative picture of affluent Chinese culture.Stephen H. West, \\"The Interpretation of a Dream: The Sources, Evaluation, and Influence of the Dongjing Meng Hua Lu,\\" T'oung Pao (1985): 63-108. Nothing else is known of the author, evidently a minor government official, except that he lived in Bianjing () (now called Kaifeng, in Henan province) between the ages of 13 and 27 before escaping to the south. His book was first printed in 1187, but the Preface is dated 1147, a number of years after the capital was moved, indicating that Meng started a draft at this point. The work was published in 10 volumes (juan) and traditional bibliographers classified it as travel writing. It is often cited under the abbreviated name, Meng Hua lu.Endymion Wilkinson. Chinese History: A New Manual. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Asia Center, Harvard-Yenching Institute Monograph Series New Edition; Second, Revised printing March 2013. ) p. 761. The meaning of the title The literal meaning of the title is Dongjing (Eastern Capital, that is, Kaifeng), meng (dream), Hua (the ancient land of perfection) lu (record). The allusion is to the Yellow Emperor's dream of the land of Hua Xu, \\"a sphere of perfect joy and harmony,\\" where people knew no fear, selfishness, avarice, or pain. When he awoke, the Yellow Emperor came to the realization that the Way could not be achieved through the passions. By using the term, Meng Yuanlao in ironic contrast implies that he himself awoke to a world of \\"perfect shambles.\\"West, \\"The Interpretation of a Dream,\\" p. 70, n. 36 . The historian Wu Pei-yi adds that the Chinese word meng and the English word \\"dream\\" have quite different overtones: \\"In modern English usage dreams are often projected into the future: they stand for hopes or wishes. In China dreams are frequently used as figures for the past.\\"Wu p. 50 Other uses of the word meng in Chinese literature include the 18th century novel, Honglou Meng (Dream of the Red Chamber) and the 13th century essay, Mengliang lu (Dreaming Over a Bowl of Millet), which is modeled on Menghua lu.Wilkinson. Chinese History: A New Manual. p. 762. The Dream of Hua Meng's Preface (dated 1147) tells the reader of the old capital: :Peace stretched on day after day; people were many and all things were in abundance. Youths with trailing locks practiced naught but drumming and dancing, the aged with white speckled [hair] recognized neither shield nor spear. Season and festival followed one upon the other, each with its own sights to enjoy. Lamplit nights there were and moonlit eves, periods of snow and times of blossoming, beseeching skills and climbing heights, training reservoirs and gardens to roam in. Raise the eyes and there were green bowers and painted chambers, embroidered gates and pearly shades. Decorated chariots vied to park in the Heavenly Avenue and bejeweled horses competed to spur through the Imperial Street. Gold and kingfisher dazzled the eye, silky cloth and silken gauze let float their perfumes. ... New sounds and sly giggles were found in the willowy lanes and flowered paths, pipes were fingered and strings were harmonized in the tea districts and wine wards. (Translation by Steven W. West)West, \\"The Interpretation of a Dream\\" pp. 68-69. The preface boasts: \\"The treasures and curiosities from around the world are gathered here, all are sold on the market. The exquisite scents from all over the world were to be found here.\\" Meng must have been well placed and had enough money to take advantage of the city's pleasures. He also describes imperial rituals, although he may have heard of them second hand.West, \\"The Interpretation of a Dream\\" pp. 68-69. Restaurants, street performers, and nightlife The scholar Wu Pei-yi writes that \\"what distinguishes the book from other writings on cities is its detailed description of everyday life as it was lived in the streets and marketplaces.... Food and drink seem to have been everyone's preoccupation.\\" Wu p. 57 Meng delights in street entertainments which serious writers disdained, even mentioning the performers by name: :Wildman Zhao would eat and drink while hung upside down.... Hua Zhuoer would sing medleys; Big Head Wen and Little Cao would play the lute; Dang Qian would perform with wind instruments.... Zou Yi and Tian Di would impersonate rustic visitors to the capital.... Yin Chang would regale his listeners with stories from the history of the Five Dynasties; Liu Baiqiin would have his birds and beasts demonstrate tricks; Yang Wenxiu would play the drum and the flute....Wu, p. 53 Romanization changed to pinyin. The descriptions of food include over one hundred famous dishes and snacks, local specialties, street snacks, as well as reflections on famous taverns, restaurants, pasta and noodle restaurant. The book is thus an important source for the history of Chinese food and drinking culture. It even describes regional cuisines during the Northern Song Dynasty. The numerous mentions of Sichuan cuisine are particularly striking. The evocation of an evening at a restaurant is particularly vivid: :When the guests arrive, a single person holding chopsticks and a menu questions all of the seated guests. The men of the capital are extravagant and they demand a hundred different things- some hot, some cold, some warm, some regular, some extremely cold-and things like noodles laced with lean and fatty meat. Everyone orders something different. The waiter takes the orders and draws near a counter where he stands in line and recites [the orders] off from the start.... in a little while the waiter sticks three bowls in his left hand, then piles up about twenty dishes along his right arm from hand to shoulder, distributing them in complete accordance with each person's order. Not the slightest error is allowed.West, \\"The Interpretation of a Dream\\" p. 87. Qingming Festival The section in Book 7 describing Spring festival has been used to explain one of China's most famous scroll paintings, the Qingming Shanghe tu (Ê∏ÖÊòé‰∏äÊ≤≥Âúñ) of Zhang Zeduan (ÂºµÊìáÁ´Ø), which was taken as depicting the Spring Festival: :The new graves are visited on this day and cleaned, the people of the capital (Bianjing) go to the suburbs ...... When they return in the evening, wear all muted flat pancakes, clay figures, toy knives, precious flowers, exotic fruits, toy models made of clay (landscapes, buildings, people, etc.), (lucky) game accessories, duck eggs or chicks with him, call the they are \\"gifts from outside the (city) gates.\\" Litters are decorated with various flowers and willow branches, all four sides are covered.\\" translation. Reiner Stoppok, quoted by Li Song (1998:6) Literary value and influence Evaluations of the literary style differ. Meng's own preface describes his language as \\"coarse and vulgar\\" and \\"not adorned by literary style.\\" He warns: \\"Reader, please take careful note of this!\\" For many years Chinese critics agreed that the prose was of low quality because it mixed colloquialisms and poorly written literary Chinese. The modern expert Steven West, however, suggests that this inconsistent style resulted when Meng mixed passages from a journal of some kind with later compositions, then used slang and technical terms.West, \\"The Interpretation of a Dream\\" pp. 70, 97-98. Wu Pei-yi, another recent historian, believes that the book's appeal lies in \\"the elements of style that it shares with the modern art of photography: the vivid and minute inventory of visual detail, the refusal to delve behind the facade, the preoccupation with the present moment, and the concealment of a narrator.\\"Wu, p. 55. The performance of Dongjing Menghua Lu \\"Song Dynasty-Dongjing Menghua\\" is a performance on the water in Qingming River Park in Kaifeng. The performance lasts 70 minutes, and there are more than 700 actors involved.

The British captured her in 1796 and took her into the Royal Navy under the name HMS Jamaica. They rated her as a sixth-rate 26-gun frigate. She served during both the French Revolutionary Wars and part of the Napoleonic Wars, during which she captured some privateers and participated in a boat attack. The Admiralty had her laid up in 1810 and sold her in 1814. Design Per√ßante was one of four Bonne Citoyenne-class corvettes launched between 1794 and 1796, all four of which the Royal Navy captured between 1796 and 1798. The class was built to a design by Raymond-Antoine Haran. All members of the class were flush-decked, but with a long topgallant forecastle. French service Per√ßante was stationed at Bayonne and Rochefort. Initially she was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau Laporte, who commanded her from 13 June 1795 to 17 August.Fonds, Vol. 1, 158. His replacement was lieutenant de vaisseau (later capitaine de fr√©gate) Tourtelot. He commanded her at least during the period 20 October to 23 November. Her first major voyage was to Guyane, where she first delivered member of the National Convention Bertrand Bar√®re into exile, and then delivered dispatches and supplies to the Antilles. Her second voyage had her carrying arms and munitions from the √éle-d'Aix roads with destinations Cayenne and then Basse- Terre. For this voyage she was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau (later capitaine de fr√©gate) Tourtelot (the elder).Fonds, vol. 1, p. 180. Capture On 6 December 1795, Per√ßante departed La Rochelle, under orders from the Minister of Marine and Colonies not to communicate with any vessel on the way. In late February 1796, Per√ßante was sailing from Cayenne to Cap Fran√ßais when, near Samana Bay, around 21:00, she encountered the 64-gun third rate , patrolling and looking for reinforcements expected from Cork. Intrepid gave chase, and the two ships exchanged fire from 23:00 until 04:00 the next morning, when the wind strengthened, giving an advantage to Per√ßante. However, Per√ßante soon sighted two British corvettes to the north and a frigate in the south; Tourtelot then ordered Per√ßante beached in a cove to the east of Porto Plata.Troude, vol.3, p.33. Intrepid anchored and started bombarding Per√ßante, forcing her crew to abandon her after destroying her pumps and opening her sea valves in an attempt to scuttle her. The British nevertheless managed to retrieve Per√ßante, and commissioned her in the Royal Navy as the sixth-rate HMS Jamaica. Tourtellot was honourably acquitted of the loss of his ship. British service Commander Samuel Brooking commissioned Jamaica in April 1796, on the Jamaica station, where he and she would remain for some three years. (Brooking received his promotion to post captain, the appropriate rank for the captain of a frigate, in July 1796.) On 27 November 1796 Jamaica captured Ad√©la√Øde and on 10 June 1797 Dix Apr√®s. During the period 29 October 1797 and 12 March 1798 Jamaica destroyed a French 10-gun privateer schooner, name unknown. On 7 February 1798 she captured the French privateer schooner Fortun√©e. The schooner was armed with one or more 4-pounder guns. Towards the end of the next year, on 27 November 1798, Jamaica captured Rebecca, and then on 9 December she captured the Fox. Early in 1799, that is on 7 January, 27 January, and 24 February, Jamaica captured the vessels Shark, Friends, and Gravenhorst. Also, between 12 February and 30 March, Jamaica captured two merchant vessels. Later that year Jamaica sailed to Britain. later, on 25 July, Jamaica, and passed Plymouth as they sailed up the Channel escorting the East India, Jamaica, Lisbon, and Oporto fleets.Naval Chronicle, (Jul-Dec 1799), vol. 2, p. 354. On 22 August Jamaica arrived at Deptford; she was paid off there in August. She remained at Deptford for repairs until October, with Captain John Mackeller recommissioning her in September. Mackeller escorted a fleet of merchantmen to and from the Baltic and recaptured an English mast- ship and a brig laden with corn. He also forced a privateer, under the command of Captain Blankeman, to throw 14 guns and other gear overboard during an unsuccessful, for Jamaica, chase.Marshall (1824), vol. 2, p. 218.Blankeman was a notorious privateer whose name is variously reported as \\"Blanckman\\", \\"Blankman\\", \\"Blanchman\\", \\"Blankeman\\", \\"Blackeman\\", among others. The year before, had captured him and his then vessel, which the Royal Navy took into service as . The two English vessels recaptured may have been the Duke of Athol and James and Ruth on 13 and 14 December 1800. In March 1801 Mackeller transferred to , sailing her to the East Indies in June. In 1801 Captain James Brisbane replaced Mackeller, only to have Captain Jonas Rose replaced Brisbane, still in March. Rose then sailed Jamaica to the Baltic, where she participated in the Battle of Copenhagen. Jamaica and the various British brigs and gunvessels were tasked with raking the southern end of the Danish line. Towards the end of the battle, Jamaica was nearby when the Danish ship of the line Dannebrog exploded. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service medal with clasp \\"Copenhagen\\" to all the surviving British claimants from the battle. Jamaica returned to the Channel and on 20 and 21 August her boats and several vessels were involved in action in the neighbourhood of √âtaples. On the evening of 20 August Jamaica was off Etaples when she heard cannon fire and lookouts saw a large fire. Rose sailed to investigate, encountering , which informed him that the fire came from a cargo of pitch and tar on a vessel wrecked on the coast some time previously that boats from Hound and had set on fire. Six flat boats had come out of Saint Valery but Hound had forced them onshore, where they still lay. The following morning Rose sent in boats from Jamaica, the brig sloops Hound and , and the gunbrigs Mallard and Tygress. As the boats went in the ships themselves provide covering fire. The boats brought out two launches and a flat boat 45' long and 24' wide, armed with an 8\\" howitzer. However, the latter later sank; the other three on shore had already been so damaged that they were irretrievable, but the landing party still did as much further damage as time permitted. Jamaica lost one man killed, and each of the other four British vessels had a man wounded in the effort. In 1803-4, Jamaica captured or recaptured a number of vessels. *Jeune Carolie (or Jeune Corallie), 2 June; *Dutch ship Jeune Marie, 2 June, in company with the privateer Lord Nelson; *Marie and Madaline, French fishing vessels, 7 June; *Sirene, 19 June; *Brigs Eagle and Leander, recaptured 5 January 1804; During this period, on 13 August 1803, Jamaica was seven leagues off the Isle de Bas, when she captured the French privateer Fanny. Fanny was a cutter of two guns and 20 men. She had only been out 12 hours before Jamaica captured her and had made no captures herself. Captain John Dick replaced Rose on 24 November 1804.Gentleman's Magazine, (November 1854), vol. 196, p. 512. Under his command Jamaica served on the Channel and Newfoundland stations.Gentleman's Magazine, (November 1854), vol. 196, p. 512. He sailed Jamaica for Newfoundland on 19 January 1806. On 10 April, perhaps on the way, Jamaica and detained Algema Belong. On 7 November, Jamaica recaptured the brig Margaret, B. Vickers, master. In 1807 Captain Arthur Lysaght, who had been promoted to post captain on 25 September 1806,Marshall (1827), Supplement - Part 1, p. 184. commanded Jamaica on the Jersey station. On 6 May 1807 the boats of , the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Saumarez, captured the French ship Julia. Jamaica and shared in the proceeds of the capture. Jamaica appears to have had her share of disciplinary problems. On 29 October 1807, a court martial was convened aboard . First, Surgeon W.W. Hutchinson was tried for making provoking speeches and gestures towards Lieutenant J. Mascall of the Royal Marines. Hutchinson called the purser as a witness, but Mascall objected, arguing that the purser was an atheist. Lieutenant Philip Helpman gave evidence concerning the purser's character that led to the purser being dismissed the service. Then the court martial tried the master, Mr. Hartree for drunkenness and contempt towards Lysaght. Mascall was tried also for drunkenness and abusive behavior towards Hutchinson.

An example of a Hong Kong name in English is Carrie LAM CHENG Yuet-ngor, which follows the English name + Hong Kong Cantonese Surname + Personal Name format. The surname is located in the middle of the name, which is usually capitalised. Generally, the Cantonese majority employ one or another romanization of Cantonese.Caroline Courtauld, May Holdsworth, Simon Vickers The Hong Kong story -1997 Page xi \\"A Note on the Romanization of Chinese Names The majority of Chinese personal names in Hong Kong are romanized according to their Cantonese pronunciation; a small number are rendered differently.

Inspiration for English names in Hong Kong can come from the names of months, sports brands, and luxury labels. More conventional English names can undergo distortion by the adding, substitution, or deletion of letters (e.g. Sonija, Garbie, Kith), as well using suffixes like -son (e.g. Rayson). They also sometimes come from mimicking the sounds of the Chinese name, like Hacken Lee from Lee Hak-kan (). These categories (addition, substitution, phonetic-based, etc) are the fundamental ways of generating creative Hong Kong names. Hong Kongers may also append a middle name. For example, the 4th Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet Ngor, Yuet Ngor is her given name, Cheng being her maiden name, Lam being the surname of her spouse.

The film stars James Franco, Kate Hudson, Omar Sy, Tom Wilkinson, and Sam Spruell and tells the story of an American couple, Tom and Anna Wright, living in London who fall into severe debt while renovating their family‚Äôs home. The film was released in select theaters and on demand on 26 September 2014. The film is the second collaboration between Maguire and Franco, who both worked in Spider-Man Trilogy. Plot The story begins with four men pulling a heist together. The men rob a man named Khan (Omar Sy), a well-known French heroin dealer, of his drugs and money. Ben Tuttle and Bobby emerge from the building first. Ben shoots Bobby and runs off with all of the money and drugs. The two other men, Jack Witkowski (Sam Spruell) and Marshall (Diarmaid Murtagh), exit later. They find Bobby dead, and run off before they get caught. Tom Wright (James Franco) and his wife Anna (Kate Hudson) are living in London and have fallen into severe debt while renovating their family's home. They are trying to have a baby, but have been unsuccessful thus far. After their downstairs tenant doesn't respond to their requests to keep it down, the couple go downstairs to discover their neighbor, Ben, is dead. The official cause of death is ruled by the police a heroin overdose. While cleaning the apartment, the Wrights discover ¬£220,000 in a loose ceiling tile. They debate what to do with the money, as well as the remainder of Ben's things. After some time, Tom spends some money paying off the house they were renovating, and Anna spends some money to go to a fertility clinic. Meanwhile, Detective Halden (Tom Wilkinson) suspects that the Wrights are withholding information. He begins tracking their movements, as he seems to believe Ben's death is connected to his daughter's. A man is shown being threatened by Jack Witkowski to reveal the location of his cousin, Ben. As soon as he reveals this, he is killed. Witkowski and his partner Marshall break into Ben's old apartment to look for the money, but are unsuccessful. Khan approaches Tom Wright about his money, claiming that Tom must choose a side, his or Jack Witkowski's. Tom refuses to choose a side and when he arrives home, Witkowski is waiting for him. Witkowski tortures Tom, but Tom refuses to give up the location of the money. Detective Halden arrives and Witkowski and his partner run off. Halden tells the Wrights he wants to use them as bait, off the books, to arrest Witkowski, as Witkowski has inside connections with law enforcement. The Wrights schedule a money drop with Witkowski, and then meet with Detective Halden and Khan separately to devise a plan. During the drop, Witkowski realises Halden is a cop and Marshall shoots Halden. The Wrights run off with the money and Khan tells them they are on their own, as he believes he has been played. Halden is shown recovering in the hospital, as he was wearing a bulletproof vest. Witkowski and his men take Anna's friend Sarah (Anna Friel) and her baby, Julian, hostage. The Wrights agree to meet Witkowski at the house the Wrights were renovating, where they've been hiding. The Wrights inform Halden of the plan and rig the house in preparation for their meeting. Witkowski falls through the floor and Tom puts nails through Marshall's feet. Khan and his men arrive at the house, to the surprise of everyone. Halden arrives at the house and kills one of Khan's men with his car as Sarah and her baby escape, but Halden is knocked unconscious. A game of cat and mouse ensues throughout the house between Khan and his men, Witkowski and Marshall, and the Wrights. Khan's other man is killed by Tom and Khan kills Witkowski. Tom fights with Khan, who is about to kill Tom when a shot from Marshall, directed at them both, kills Khan. Anna is nearly choked to death by Marshall until a revived Halden enters the house and shoots Marshall dead. The movie ends with the house burning to the ground, the Wrights moving out of their apartment, and Anna telling Tom that she is pregnant.

Legend The Wawel Dragon (Polish: Smok Wawelski) is a famous dragon in Polish mythology who lived in a cave at the foot of Wawel Hill on the banks of the Vistula River. One of the many popular stories about the dragon takes place in Krak√≥w during the reign of King Krakus, the city's mythical founder. In the legend, the dragon terrifies local villagers by destroying their houses and eating up their young daughters. Desperate to solve the problem, King Krakus promises his daughter Wanda's hand to any brave man who can defeat the dragon. A cobbler named Skuba takes up the challenge and stuffs a lamb with sulphur for the dragon to eat. Skuba leaves the lamb near the dragon cave and the unwary beast devours the bait. Soon after, the dragon's thirst grows unbearable and he drinks so much water from the River Vistula that he explodes from the uncontainable volume. King Krakus then weds his daughter Wanda to the victorious Skuba. In the oldest, 12th century version of this tale, written by Wincenty Kad≈Çubek.Mistrz Wincenty tzw. Kad≈Çubek, \\"Kronika Polska\\", Ossolineum, Wroc≈Çaw, 2008, dragon was defeated by two sons of a King Krak, Krakus II and Lech II. Statue The statue was designed by Polish sculptor Bronis≈Çaw Chromy and completed in 1969; it was installed in its present location in 1972, a date commonly repeated in other sources; Bielowicz notes that the statue was made in 1969 but was not unveiled in its current location till 1972. The statue is made out of bronze and stands on a large limestone boulder. It is tall. Video of the statue breathing fire The statue breathing fire Some early designs for the statue included a more traditional water fountain. A later variant proposed that it should be partially submerged in the nearby Vistula river, but this was rejected. In the end, the statue was designed to breathe fire; it was also modernized recently so that the fire breath can be triggered by a SMS text message (the statue can do so at minimum 15 seconds intervals). The service is popular, and has received at least 2,500 requests in one day. The fire uses natural gas as fuel. Without any text messages, the fire breaths occur at about five-minute intervals. The statue has been described as a \\"traditional\\" element of the modern Krak√≥w landscape, and as a major tourist attraction of the city, particularly for children.

It stars Nicholas Braun, Mackenzie Davis, Josh Fadem, Joan Cusack, Bob Odenkirk, Keegan-Michael Key, Ed Westwick, Patton Oswalt, Vanessa Hudgens and Denis Leary. The film was issued in a limited release by Columbia Pictures on October 30, 2015. The film follows three high- school outcasts whose social alienation is compounded when they join rival species in a town inhabited by humans, vampires and zombies. Aliens set the species against each other, and the outcasts try to band everyone together to fight the invaders.  Plot  The town of Dillford, Ohio, is home to three species who despise each other: humans, vampires, and zombies. School nerd Dag sets out to lose his virginity with Lorelei, the hottest girl in school. He has issues with Rick Wilson, the baseball coach and manager of the local meat factory. Rick fired all of the human employees, including Dag's mother, and replaced them with zombies as cheap labor. Social outcast Petra is transformed into a vampire after being bitten by Milan, the high school's playboy vampire, while they are making out. Dag's former best friend Ned is also a social outcast at high school. Following Petra's transformation into a vampire and an argument with his family, Ned visits the zombie ghetto. He allows a female teenage zombie to bite his leg, transforming him into a zombie. Aliens invade Dillford, causing residents to believe that the vampires, zombies and humans are attacking each other. Dag and Lorelei hide in a house which is raided by a group of vampires and Lorelei is turned into a vampire by Petra. In subsequent brawls between the factions, Dag, Ned, and Petra join together and hide in Stuart Miller's basement, but Petra and Ned are overcome by hunger and eat Stuart and his mother. The aliens are able to determine their location, causing them to seek cover at the high school. Petra and Dag become trapped and make out, but he flinches and Petra accuses him of being afraid of her. The aliens find them again, and Dag realizes that the aliens can only see inorganic materials, such as their synthetic clothing. The three then strip and run to Dag's house, where they change into organic cotton clothes kept by Dag's hippie mother. Later, Dag, Petra, and Ned are captured by the aliens. They are placed with other captured residents in a warehouse, with force fields segregating the humans, vampires and zombies. Dag, Ned, and Petra convince everyone to band together to fight the aliens. At Rick Wilson's meat factory, the chemical \\"Tetrafluoraxipan\\" is used to transform horse cartilage into a meat-like substance. The aliens submerge in the chemical and combine to grow into a single large alien. It begins to make a speech, but the town's irritated residents interrupt, enraging it. The alien fights the town's residents who determine that the alien's weakness is ammonia. Meanwhile, Milan corners Petra and attempts to kill her. He is stopped by Dag, who turns into a werewolf. After a short brawl, Milan is accidentally killed when he lands on a wooden slab, which impales him. As the outclassed alien is shrinking back to its mini size, it attempts to escape by spaceship while dropping a bomb to destroy the town. Ned catches the bomb and gives it to Dag who throws it into the ship before it closes it's doors and the spaceship explodes, destroying the alien menace. Everything returns to normal for the town, and it is discovered that Lorelei is alive. However, Dag chooses to be with Petra instead. Ned appears to be happier and better adjusted as a zombie, and seems to have bonded with his star athlete brother who has also become a zombie.

Macy & Company in New York City and was an owner of mines, a hotel, and other businesses in Colorado. Early life Jerome Byron Wheeler was born September 3, 1841 in Troy, New York to Daniel Barker Wheeler and Mary Jones Emerson, both of Massachusetts. His mother was a second cousin of Ralph Waldo Emerson. His family moved to Waterford, New York when Wheeler was young. He attended public school there until the age of 15. He obtained a clerical position in 1856. From 1857 to 1861 he pursued mechanical trades \\"which may have included engineering, mechanical, or machine shop work.\\" Civil War 6th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry, Colonel Thomas Devin Wheeler enlisted as a private in the 6th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry on his 20th birthday and at the beginning of the Civil War. He trained in Staten Island, New York and was stationed in Washington D.C. before obtaining his horse with the rest of the regiment in Cloud Mills, Virginia. The regiment fought throughout the Shenandoah Valley and during General George McClellan's Peninsular campaign. Wheeler was made second lieutenant under Colonel Thomas Devin and moved up the ranks and was made a colonel. Going against the \\"wishes of his superiors\\", Wheeler brought supplies to a group of starving Union Army soldiers who were positioned behind enemy lines. Considering the effort too dangerous, his rank of colonel was \\"reputedly\\" revoked. He mustered out of the army in September 1865. New York After the war, Wheeler returned to Troy, New York and worked as a bookkeeper. Wheeler moved to New York City about May 1866 and took a clerical position at John F. Barkley and Company, a grain merchant. He worked at Holt and Company, a large flour and grain commission house, starting in 1869 as a bookkeeper. He had several positions before becoming a full partner in the firm after 10 years at the firm. Wheeler married Harriet Macy Valentine in 1870. She was a descendant of Thomas Macy, one of the first European settlers in Nantucket, and niece of Rowland Hussey Macy who founded the R.H. Macy and Company, which became a large department store in New York City. In 1879, a few years after Rowland Hussey Macy's death, Charles Webster brought Wheeler in to be a 45% partner in the purchase of the department store. He remained a partner until 1888, when there was stiff competition from other department stores with fruitful advertising campaigns. Wheeler died in Colorado in December 1918. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. Colorado In 1883 Wheeler visited Colorado and \\"fell in love with the Colorado mountains\\". Aspen He decided to invest in \\"productive mines\\" in Aspen and Leadville. Within Aspen, Wheeler purchased mines and built a tramway to bring ore down the mountain where it was processed in a smelter he built at the base of the mountain. The smelter was owned by the Aspen Smelting Company. Wheeler was president of the Croseus Gold Mining and Milling Company. He spent nearly one million dollars each to build the Hotel Jerome and the Wheeler Opera House. He also invested in the Colorado Midland Railway and in 1885 became a director of the organization. In 1888, Wheeler had the Wheeler-Stallard House built, but never lived in the home. Wheeler also built a mountain tramway and a bank in Aspen.

Wheeler built the Wheeler Bank in 1888, the town's first financial institution, and the Manitou Mineral Water Company, which bottled and shipped mineral water across the country, including New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel. In 1893, Wheeler built the Windemere estate in Manitou Springs, which included a conservatory, coach house, billiard rooms and bowling alley. He invested in the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway, a cog railway that transported passengers to the top of Pikes Peak.

Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 26. He hoped the volumes would play a role in the open conspiracy to establish a progressive world government that he had been promoting since the mid-1920s.  Genesis and reception  Wells had great difficulty devising a comprehensive book discussing the world's economic life from a psychological point of view. The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind had at various times more than a dozen working titles (such as The Anatomy of MoneyAs witnessed by his friend Charlie Chaplin, in his Autobiography, where he also pointed out that the conception of the book had taken two years.). As in The Science of Life, Wells worked with collaborators. Hugh P. Vowles and Edmund Cressey agreed to work with him on the book in 1928, but Vowles's work did not satisfy Wells. A bitter wrangle ensued in which the Society of Authors became involved, to Wells's chagrin.Norman and Jeanne Mackenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (Simon and Schuster, 1973), pp. 359‚Äì63. In early 1929 he overcame the discouragement these difficulties caused and resumed work on the book, with the help of Amber Reeves on the sections on money and economics and of Alexander Carr-Saunders on demography. Odette Keun, Wells's lover from 1924 to 1933, served as the work's general editor. Graham Wallas also offered substantial assistance.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 264‚Äì67. The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind sold relatively well (17,000 copies in England in the first month alone).David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 266. But the Great depression restrained sales and Wells's optimistic utopianism struck many as pass√© and na√Øve in the increasingly violent political climate of the 1930s.Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owen, 2010), pp. 289‚Äì90.  Organization of work  The Work, World and Happiness of Mankind is divided into sixteen chapters following an introduction explaining the work's conception. The historical development of human mastery over matter and energy occupies Chapters 1‚Äì3. Chapter 4 is on agriculture, Chapter 5 on clothing and shelter. Chapter 6 describes the distribution of goods and Chapter 7 the organisation of work. Chapter 8 offers an original analysis of the psychology of work. Chapters 9 and 10 analyse money, finance, and economic inequality. Chapter 11 is devoted to the social and economic role of women. Chapter 12 depicts government and the military. Chapter 13 discusses the problem of races, rejecting segregation, racism, and eugenics. Chapter 14 discusses sport, art, and entertainment. Chapter 15 analyses problems of religion, education, and social discipline. Chapter 16 addresses the future prospects of humanity. Two historical figures are praised near the beginning and the end of The Work, World, and Happiness of Mankind because they seem to Wells to be essentially linked to his enterprise: Roger Bacon, a precursor of the Enlightenment, and Denis Diderot, the first writer to envision the possibilities of modern encyclopaedias.  Overarching themes   Economics is grounded in biology and psychology  Humans are \\"economic animals\\" because they prepare and store food socially. This important development occurred in the Pleistocene, when man \\"became very rapidly indeed an unprecedented species.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 30. For Wells, the adaptation of the \\"very imperfect instrument\\" of the human mind to new and developing possibilities is the essence of humanity's economic problem.H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 64.  Satisfying the demands of the persona is the fundamental human enterprise  Wells endorses Jung's concept of the persona, which he regards as susceptible of education. \\"Beneath the material processes of economics lies the social idea; its driving force is will. The clearer the idea, the better organized the will in the personas of our species, the more hopeful and successful the working of the human ant-hill.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 299. Wells proposes that there are three fundamental types of persona that differ in many ways, but in particular in their attitude toward property: (1) the peasant; (2) the nomad; (3) the priest. \\"The first type is acquisitive, tenacious, and preservative; the second is rapacious and consumes; the third professes to be more or less aloof from possession and gain, and to carry on the service of the community for satisfaction of a quite different type.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 315. Wells seriously entertains the proposal of Frederick Soddy that the \\"money manipulator\\" may be \\"a new type whose primary delight is domination and oppression through relative gain\\" but concludes that if this is so, \\"the conception pervading this book . . . is unsound\\" and \\"[t]here is nothing for it but . . . a class war against the rich and the able . . . and beginning again upon a different ground plan, with whatever hope is left to us, amidst the ruins.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), pp. 488 & 492‚Äì93.  The stupidity of contemporary political institutions  Wells's treatment of contemporary political institutions is aggressively satirical, but he attributes their shortcomings to their need to accommodate the biological heritage human beings have inherited to solve the problem of what he calls \\"assent,\\" or legitimation.H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), pp. 591‚Äì601.  The importance of education  What hope Wells has for the prospects of humanity rests primarily on human educability. \\"Every human being is to some extent an educable creature.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 715. Religion's social role has been to a large degree educational; moreover, \\"[e]ducation has been the last field of intellectual activity to pass out of religious control, and it is still imperfectly and doubtfully released.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 725. Wells has doubts about the role played by universities, attached as they are to religious institutions and wealthy interests. But he has high hopes for extra-scholastic education, including newspapers, literature, and encyclopaedias. Ultimately he hopes for \\"a recasting of [the world's] schools to meet the needs of a new education,\\" helped or controlled by \\"a world government.\\"H.G. Wells, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind (London: William Heinemann, 1932), p. 777.

As one of Korea's most famous poets, he and his works symbolize the spirit of the Korean anti- Japanese resistance of the 1930s and 1940s. Life Yi was born in Dosan- myeon, Andong on May 18, 1904. Yi was a descendant of the scholar Yi Hwang, better known as Toegye. Yi completed his basic education in Andong, graduating at the age of 15 in 1919.Yi Yuk-sa: One hundred years. Retrieved on 18 March 2015. In 1920, at age 17, he moved with his family to Daegu and married. Yi became a teacher at the academy at which he studied, but in 1924 left for Japan to study in University.Yeungnam Observer http://observer.yu.ac.kr/news/quickViewArticleView.html?idxno=171 In 1925 Yi returned to Daegu and along with his brothers, joined the Uiyoldan, an association formed in response to Japanese repression of the Korean Independence Movement. The Uiyoldan was associated with acts of sabotage and assassination. Yi moved to Beijing in 1925/26, likely because of this association, and studied at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. Yi returned to Korea in 1927. When members of the Uiyoldan bombed the Daegu branch of the Choseon Bank, Yi was among the arrested and spent 18 months in prison. In 1929 Yi began to work as a journalist, and in 1930 he published his first poem ‚ÄúHorse,‚Äù in the Choseon Ilbo. From 1931 to 1933 he studied in China, but continued to maintain contacts with the Korean resistance. In 1935 he began to concentrate on his writing, publishing both poems and critical essays. Accounts have Yi arrested a total of 17 times. Death In April 1943 he went to Beijing and apparently began smuggling weapons into Korea. In 1943 Yi returned to Korea on the first anniversary of the death of his mother. He was arrested in Korea and transferred to Beijing, where he died in prison on January 16, 1944, at the age of 39. Controversy lingered after Yi's death and there are allegations from eyewitnesses in the prison that suggest Yi was subject to live experimentation - which was common practice in Japanese prisons and comfort women stations, during the period. It is reported Yi's bloodstream was injected with saline solution in the prison hospital - which subsequently killed him.http://www.264.or.kr/board/index.php\\"He was cremated and buried in Miari, Seoul.Author Database: Lee Yuksa - LTI Korea http://eng.klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do?method=author_detail&AI;_NUM=238&user;_system=keuser In 1960, Yi‚Äôs remains were reinterred near his birthplace and in 1968 a memorial stone was erected in Andong. Just outside Andong there is the Yi Yuksa Museum, dedicated to the memory of his literature and freedom- fighting.Guidebook of Andong City https://www.msu.edu/~jeongeu4/DC2009/images/Andong%20Information.pdf Work While Yi only wrote approximately forty poems, the fact that they have come to represent the resistance spirit of the Korean people against the Japanese colonial government has made his work famous in Korea. In 1939 Yi published his most famous poem, ‚ÄúGreen Grapes.‚Äù Yi strove to write in the tradition of Korean lyric poetry, among other things writing in Hangul at a time during which this was banned by the Japanese government. Because of Japanese censorship, his writing had to be symbolic and metaphorical, never directly commenting on Japanese colonialism, or the issues that surrounded it. Nevertheless, his meaning was clear to Koreans, and because of this and his lyricism, his work continues to be included in school textbooks in Korea. \\"The Wide Plain\\" is perhaps the clearest example of Yi's ability to combine lyricism with anti-colonial sentiment: Statue at the Yi Yuksa Museum > On a distant day, When heaven first opened, Somewhere a cock must have > crowed. No mountain ranges, Rushing to the desired sea, Could have dared to > invade this land. While the busy seasons gust and fade, With endless time, A > great river first opens the way. Now snow falls, The fragrance of plum > blossoms is far off, I‚Äôll sow the seed of my sad song here. When a superman > comes On a white horse down the myriad years, Let him sing aloud my song on > the wide plain.Peter H. Lee, A History of Korean Literature, Cambridge > University 2003, p.370 After Yi's death, in 1946, his brother published some 20 of his works.

Written by biographer Tom Santopietro, the book demonstrates how The Godfather was a turning point in American cultural consciousness. With its emphasis on proud ethnicity, The Godfather changed not just the way Italian- Americans saw themselves, but how Americans of all backgrounds viewed their individual and national self-identities, their possibilities, and attendant disappointments.The Godfather Effect, p. 83; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, \\"The Godfather Effect\\" had a broader philosophical dimension, as well. As noted by Santopietro, \\"what Puzo delivered ‚Äì brilliantly ‚Äì was nothing less than a disquisition on the madness, glory, and failure of the American dream.\\"The Godfather Effect, p. 7; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, Early in the novel, Amerigo Bonasera declares \\"I believe in America.\\" The novel then depicts a nation where Mafia and big business are two sides of the same coin: both are corrupt, tell the truth selectively, and do exactly as they wish.The Godfather Effect, p. 81; by Tom Santopietro; St. Martins Press pub.; February 2012, Reception The Godfather Effect was widely reviewed, and well received by the press. The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"a beautiful narrative of the way pop culture shapes our self-image.\\" The Wall Street Journal declared that \\"part memoir, part devotional film essay and part reflection on the meaning of ethnicity in American life, The Godfather Effect defines how the Godfather movies, along with the 1969 Mario Puzo novel from which they were adapted, reflected the madness, glory and failure of the American dream. By exploring that dream in distinctly Italian-American terms, the movies succeeded in delivering nothing less than the Italianization of American culture. In other words, they were so cool that everyone wanted to seem a little Italian.\\" Newsday appreciated the personal dimension in Santopietro's book, noting, \\"In the end, it's the personal moments, such as Santopietro taking his aging dad to revisit the field where he played baseball as a child, that are most rewarding. The films make up the shell of The Godfather Effect, but it's the connections with family that give it a center as sweet as cannoli cream.\\" The New York Journal of Books found that Santopietro \\"capably weaves together the memoirist elements, the history, and the analyses of the formal and thematic aspects of the films.\\" The book was recognized for its historical value by Smithsonian Magazine, the official publication of the Smithsonian Institution. Author An acclaimed biographer, Santopietro wrote in-depth studies of several Hollywood icons, each of whom reflected and defined the American cultural landscape. These included Doris Day (Considering Doris Day),Considering Doris Day by Tom Santopietro Barbra Streisand (The Importance of Being Barbra), and the definitive account of Frank Sinatra's Hollywood film career (Sinatra in Hollywood).

The town is located on the banks of the Horyn River, a tributary of the Prypyat. The town of Bilohiria also administers the Bilohiria Settlement Council (), whose jurisdiction also covers the villages of Karasykha and Trostianka.

The settlement of Liakhivtsi (; ) was founded in 1441 on Bilohiria's modern-day territory. Jews were expelled from the region in 1495, but were allowed to return a few years later. The settlement received the Magdeburg rights in 1583. Polish influence increased over the 15th and 16th centuries, with Poland taking official control in 1569 with the Treaty of Lublin. Cultural life in Volhynia flourished under Polish rule, interrupted by the 1648 Chmielnicki Khmelnytsky_Uprising massacres, which killed many Jewish residents. Additional settlements formed in the 1660s. Volhynia was transferred to Polish control in 1793, where it remained until the interwar period. In 1885, Liakhivtsi was the administrative center of the Liakhivtsi volost of the Ostroh povit.

He served as a chancellor during the reign of Later Tang's second emperor Li Siyuan, but became embroiled in a power struggle with Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui. He eventually was forced into retirement, but An eventually had Li Siyuan order him to commit suicide.  Background  It is not known when Ren Huan was born, but it was known that his family was originally from Sanyuan (‰∏âÂéü, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). His grandfather Ren Qing (‰ªªÊ∏Ö) served as a deputy mayor of Chengdu. His father Ren Maohong (‰ªªËåÇÂÆè), in order to avoid late-Tang Dynasty wars that engulfed the region, fled to Taiyuan, then under the rule of the major warlord Li Keyong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan). Li Keyong recommended him as the magistrate of Xihe County (Ë•øÊ≤≥, in modern Linfen, Shanxi).History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 67. Ren Maohong had five sons ‚Äî Ren Tu (‰ªªÂúñ), Ren Hui (‰ªªÂõû), Ren Huan, Ren Tuan (‰ªªÂúò), and Ren Jiong (‰ªªÂÜè). All five were said to remarkable in appearance and behavior, impressing Li. He gave a daughter of a clansman in marriage to Ren Tuan. While Li Keyong's adoptive nephew Li Sizhao served under Li Keyong in the Hedong army, he became friendly with Ren Huan. Thus, when Li Keyong put him in charge of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), at his request, Ren Huan was made his executive secretary in his role as governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi).  During Jin  It was said that Ren Huan was handsome in appearance and capable in speaking. There had been an occasion when false accusations were laid against Li Sizhao to Li Keyong's son and successor Li Cunxu (who then ruled the domain as the Prince of Jin after Tang's fall). Whenever Ren served as emissary from Li Sizhao to Li Cunxu's court, he would explain on Li Sizhao's behalf, to keep the communications open and friendly. When Ren's mother died, Li Cunxu, in the name of the emperor of the fallen Tang, recalled him to governmental service, serving as Li Sizhao's judicial officer in his role as governor of Zhaoyi. In 922, during Li Cunxu's campaign against Zhang Chujin, whose father Zhang Wenli had assassinated Li Cunxu's ally Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao and taken over Zhao lands, Li Sizhao was killed in battle. Under orders that Li Sizhao left before he died, the command of the Zhaoyi soldiers then with Li Cunxu's army was given to Ren, and Ren kept the command structure and pass codes in place, such that during the continued siege of Zhao's capital Zhen Prefecture (ÈéÆÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), the Zhen rebels were unaware of Li Sizhao's death for some time.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. Li Cunxu awarded Ren greatly for this appropriate handling of the situation. Ren subsequently served under the subsequent Jin commanders of the operations, Li Cunjin and Li Cunshen, and served with distinction. When Zhang Chujin's brother Zhang Chuqiu (ÂºµËôïÁêÉ) was facing him during the siege and begged him to help find a way such that Li Cunxu would spare him and his brothers, Ren pointed out to him that given what Zhang Wenli did, it was difficult for him and his brothers to be spared, but they should at least make overtures to surrender, and if they did, there was a good chance that their sons would be spared. Zhang Chuqiu believed Ren and did so. It was said that it was because of this that, after Zhen eventually fell, while the Zhang brothers were killed, the populace was largely spared.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 28. After the Zhen siege, it appeared that Ren returned to Zhaoyi (which, by that point, was under the acting command of Li Sizhao's son Li Jitao and had been renamed Anyi to observe naming taboo for Li Sizhao), as he was described to have been summoned to Li Cunxu's court, then at Wei Prefecture (È≠èÂ∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), from Anyi, along with the eunuch monitor of the army, Zhang Juhan, in anticipation of Li Cunxu's preparations to take the throne as emperor of a new Later Tang. (However, this caused apprehension on Li Jitao's part, as his taking of the circuit was not with the full sanction of Li Cunxu, and he believed that Li Cunxu's summoning of Ren and Zhang were in anticipation of actions against him, and therefore submitted the circuit to the emperor of Jin's archrival Later Liang, Zhu Zhen.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272.  During Later Tang   During Li Cunxu's reign  Shortly after, in 923, Li Cunxu declared himself emperor of Later Tang. He, for the time being, set his capital at Wei (which he made into Xingtang Municipality (ËààÂîê)), while making several other cities subsidiary capitals. In particular, he made Zhen the northern capital as a new Zhending Municipality (ÁúüÂÆö), and made Ren Huan its mayor and defender, as well as the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). Later in the year, Li Cunxu conquered Later Liang and made Luoyang his capital instead. He gave his chief of staff Guo Chongtao the post of military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered at Zhending), and Ren was made the commander of the Chengde army and the director of supplies in the northern circuits, as well as continuing to serve as the acting mayor of Zhending. As Guo (at that time) was friendly with Ren, he entrusted the matters of the circuit to Ren in his absence (as he continued to serve as chief of staff to the emperor), and Ren was said to have governed it with grace and love for the people. However, the relationship between Ren and Guo soon deteriorated over Ren's not always following Guo's directions, and Ren's trust for a corrupt judicial officer, Zhang Peng (ÂºµÂΩ≠). It was said that at Zhang's machinations, the funds that were designated for governmental loans to the people were hidden from the books, purportedly for Ren's benefit. Subsequently, when Li Cunxu requisitioned Wang Rong's ladies in waiting to Luoyang, Zhang hid a particularly beautiful one, a Lady Xu, for himself. When this was discovered, Guo summoned Zhang to Luoyang, planning to have him punished. In fear, Zhang revealed the hidden governmental loan funds, and Guo, believing that Zhang was now faithful to him, spared Zhang, and this incident led to a further deterioration of his relationship with Ren. In 925, Ren was recalled to the imperial government to serve only as the minister of public works. Later in 925, Li Cunxu commissioned his son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei as the overall commander of operations against Later Tang's southwestern neighbor Former Shu, intending to destroy Former Shu. Guo was made Li Jiji's deputy, but was in effective command of the operations. Ren and Li Yu were made strategists for the campaign.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. (It was said that Guo requested Ren's presence on the campaign because he was afraid that if he did not, Ren might speak against him.) After the army subsequently destroyed Former Shu, Guo wanted to commission Ren as the military governor of Wutai Circuit (Ê≠¶Ê≥∞, headquartered in modern Chongqing), but Ren declined. When there were subsequent pockets of resistance against Later Tang rule in the Former Shu lands, Guo sent Ren and Zhang Yun (ÂºµÁ≠†) to wipe these pockets of resistance.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. In spring 926, Li Jiji and Guo were about to depart from Former Shu's capital Chengdu back to Luoyang with the army, but Li Jiji was set to leave Ren at Chengdu to serve as acting military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered at Chengdu), until the military governor that Li Cunxu commissioned, Meng Zhixiang, could arrive and take over. However, at that time, an order issued by Li Jiji's mother (Li Cunxu's wife) Empress Liu arrived, ordering Li Jiji to kill Guo. (Empress Liu had become convinced that Guo was about to rebel, while Li Cunxu, while having his suspicions, refused to believe so, and therefore she decided to issue the order herself.) Li Jiji, after some hesitation, carried out the order to kill Guo, and subsequently had Ren take over Guo's responsibilities as his deputy. Guo's death, and that of another major general, Zhu Youqian, on similarly ungrounded suspicions, caused much unrest in the army ranks and led to a number of mutinies. One of the main ones was by one of the generals most involved in the operations against Former Shu, Li Shaochen, who tried to cut off Li Jiji's path and take over the Shu lands himself. Li Jiji had Ren command the elite soldiers of the army against Li Shaochen. Li Shaochen, believing that Ren was a civilian who did not know military matters, did not taken Ren seriously, but Ren repeatedly defeated him, forcing him into defending Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan) and not being able to go on the offensive. Eventually, Han fell; Li Shaochen tried to flee but was captured in flight, and later executed. The mutinies continued, however, and in summer 926, Li Cunxu was himself killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself. One of the generals who had previously rebelled against Li Cunxu, Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Siyuan, quickly arrived at Luoyang and claimed the title of regent, initially appearing to be ready to welcome Li Jiji back to Luoyang to succeed to the throne, but soon taking an ambiguous posture. Li Jiji decided to head quickly back to Luoyang. On the way, however, the morale of his army began to collapse, and he committed suicide. Ren took over the command of his army and returned it to Luoyang, where Li Siyuan shortly after took the throne.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275.  During Li Siyuan's reign  After Li Siyuan took the throne, he commissioned Ren Huan and Zheng Jue as chancellors with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). They were also both made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)). Ren, in addition, was also made the acting director of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies). It was said that Ren was very conscious of the importance of his duties, and did his best effort to find virtuous and talent people to serve in government and cut off improper ways of advancement. Within a year, the imperial treasury became replenished, and the imperial government was on solid footing, with both the army and civilians comforted. However, his focus on governance drew jealousy and suspicion from Li Siyuan's powerful chief of staff An Chonghui. In particular, at an occasion when Ren and An had a private meeting at Ren's mansion, a beautiful singing girl of Ren's performed. An requested her, but Ren refused, further hurting their relationship. By 927, two holdover chancellors from Li Cunxu's reign, Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo, had been removed. There were thus talks that more chancellors were needed. An's close associate Kong Xun was formerly a Later Liang official and did not want to see more chancellors from former Jin territory, and therefore recommended fellow Later Liang official Cui Xie. Ren recommended Li Qi who, while also formerly a Later Liang official, was disliked by both Zheng and Kong. Kong told An that Li Qi was corrupt, and therefore An recommended Cui, leading to further dispute between An and Ren. Eventually, Li Siyuan decided to commission Cui and Feng Dao as chancellors. Despite the disputes with An, Ren believed that his long-standing relationship with Li Siyuan allowed him to continue to speak boldly, and many other powerful people came to dislike him. In 927, there was a time when Ren and An were arguing regarding what agency would be responsible for issuing credentials for imperial messengers. Based on long-standing regulations, the credentials were to be issued by the ministry of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu), but An requested that the credentials be issued by the palace (i.e., by An, as chief of staff) instead. They got into a lengthy argument before Li Siyuan, and Ren became very loud during the argument. After the imperial meeting was complete, a lady in waiting told Li Siyuan, \\"When your servant served in the Chang'an palace [(i.e., during Tang)], I did not ever see a chancellor and a chief of staff argue like this. He is showing disrespect to the emperor.\\" Li Siyuan, aggravated, approved An's proposal. Ren thereafter requested to resign his acting directorate of the three financial agencies, and Li Siyuan agreed, transferring those authorities to Meng Gu (Â≠üÈµ†). Shortly after, Li Siyuan further relieved Ren from his chancellorship altogether, making him an acting advisor to the Crown Prince ‚Äî an honorary post, as there was no crown prince at the time. Later in the year, Ren requested retirement to Ci Prefecture (Á£ÅÂ∑û, in modern Handan), and Li Siyuan approved the request. Several months later, when the general Zhu Shouyin the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) rebelled against Li Siyuan, An's associates told him that he has to consider whether Ren might have encouraged Zhu's rebellion. An agreed, and persuaded Li Siyuan to issue an order to have Ren commit suicide, despite the protestations of An's associate, the official Zhao Feng. When the imperial messenger reached Ci, Ren summoned his family members to feast with him, and then committed suicide. He was said to have died with a solemn expression.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. He was later given posthumous honors during the reign of Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke.

Biography L√©on Motchane was of mixed Russian and Swiss parentage, of Jewish descent.Lyusdmila Anselm \\"My husband Alyosha Anselm\\" (memoires) He left Russia after the Russian revolution in 1918, emigrated to Switzerland and then to France in 1924. Encouraged by the French mathematician Paul Montel, Motchane eventually received a doctorate in mathematics at age 54 under the direction of Gustave Choquet. In 1958 C√©cile DeWitt-Morette invited L√©on Motchane to see the Institute for Advanced Study in the USA which inspired L√©on Motchane to establish an institute dedicated to fundamental research in three areas: mathematics, theoretical physics, and the methodology of human sciences (the latter area never really took root at the IH√âS). By the moral support of the American physicist Robert Oppenheimer, President of the IAS and the financial support of several major private companies he managed to create in 1958 the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques. It moved to its present location in Bois-Marie in Bures-sur- Yvette on 1962. He attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in August 1966 held in Moscow and accepted Alexander Grothendieck's Fields Medal on his behalf as Grothendieck boycotted the Congress to protest over the treatment of the dissident writers. Motchane remained the IH√âS director from 1958 until he retired in 1971 when, the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Kuiper, took over as the director of IH√âS. One of Motchane's sons, Didier, became a politician.

Overview The Nugaal Valley is a key pastoral area which spans across four regions, Nugaal, Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer. Pastoral nomadism is the primary way of life for most of the people living in the valley. Goat and camel raising form the basis of the economy, and frankincense and myrrh are collected from wild trees. The beds of the watercourses have a few permanent wells, to which the predominantly nomadic population returns during the dry season. Low and erratic rainfall (about 5 inches 125 mm annually) and the high salinity of the soil limit crop cultivation. Geography Extending 250 km along the Wadi Nugaal, the Nugaal Valley is bounded by gradually ascending high plateaus that generally reach elevations of 1,650 to 3,300 feet (500 to 1,000 m) above sea level on the north, west, and south. The western part of the same plateau is crossed by numerous valleys and dry watercourses. The same plateau sloping southwards merges with Hawd, a plain known for its grasslands. To the east is a narrow strip of low-lying maritime plains. The valley's principal watercourses, the Nugaal and the more westerly Dheere, fill briefly during and after rainstorms (April to June) and drain into the Somali Sea. The upper part of the Nugaal is filled by the seasonal river known as Tog Dheer. Flora and fauna Grassland located in the Nugaal Valley. The main vegetation in Nugaal valley consists of open grasslands, shrubs (commiphora spp), Acacia trees and dominant grasses (indigofera spp). The valley is home to succulent flora and is particularly rich in local endemics. Gypsum hills located around Las Anod supports flora such as Aloe inermis, Dorstenia, Adenia, Raphanocarpus, Euphorbia, Pterodiscus, and Caralluma. A Las Anod National Park has been proposed to protect the fine scenery, rich and varied flora, and the Somali Wild Ass. The limestone plateau north of Eyl has also been proposed as a national park due to its rich endemic flora. Oil exploration Due to its proximity to the oil-rich Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the nation has also long been believed to contain substantial unexploited reserves of crude oil. Nugaal Valley Block has been identified as having reservoir, source rock and trap potential. International oil and gas companies conducted exploration in the late 1980s in the region. During this exploration phase, a grid of 2D seismic was shot perpendicular to the axis of the rift system in the Nugaal Basin. Based on interpreted maps this data shows a number of large, closed, fault-controlled structures. Between them both, the Nugaal and Dharoor valley have only had 5 wells drilled, making the area one of the least explored areas in North Africa.

In 1869, Barton became partners with George Shawk in an electrical engineering business in Cleveland, Ohio. Later that same year, Shawk sold his share to inventor Elisha Gray and the company was renamed the Gray and Barton Co. Barton became the secretary of the company. In 1872, Gray and Barton moved the business to Chicago, Illinois, and manufactured typewriter parts, fire alarms, electric light fixtures, telegraph equipment, and related electrical devices. One of their best customers was the giant Western Union Telegraph Company. In 1881, after Western Union became a partner in the Gray and Barton Co, the latter was reorganized as the Western Electric Manufacturing Company that was later licensed under the Bell telephone patents to manufacture telephone equipment for AT&T.; In 1887 Barton became president of Western Electric and oversaw the international expansion of the company from its beginning. In 1908 he retired. He died in 1916 on his family farm in Biloxi, Mississippi. In 1926 Graybar Electric Company was spun off from Western Electric to handle distribution of Western Electric products.

Life A member of the Banu Hamdan tribe, Ali ibn Hanzala had been active within the Tayyibi da øwa, already during the tenure of the third DƒÅ øƒ´ al- Mu·π≠laq, Hatim ibn Ibrahim (1162‚Äì1199). Under the fifth DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq, Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid (1209‚Äì1215), he served as his senior deputy (ma ædh≈´n) and succeeded him when the latter died in 1215. The position of DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq (\\"absolute/unrestricted missionary\\") was the supreme authority of the Tayyibi community in their capacity as vicegerents of the absent Imam, the eponymous at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim, who remained in occultation. Like most of his predecessors and successors, Ali enjoyed good relations with the Hamdanid dynasty ruling Sanaa and their Ayyubid overlords, which allowed him to reside both in Sanaa and in the Hatimid Hamdanid stronghold of Dhu Marmar. He sent junior dƒÅ øƒ´s to assist the growing Isma'ili community in western India. At the same time, he confronted the attempts of the rival Hafizi Isma'ili da øwa and the Zaydi imams to expand their influence in his territories. His own chief aides (ma ædh≈´n) were both relatives of his predecessor, Ali ibn Muhammad: Ahmad ibn Mubarak, Ali's nephew, and Ali's son al-Husayn. Both would succeed him as DƒÅ øƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq after his death on 8 February 1229. Writings Ali ibn Hanzala was very well educated, with a particular interest in astrology and natural sciences.

If the drunkenness is not voluntary‚Äîthat is, if not caused by an act of the accused‚Äîand results in rendering the accused unconscious of what he was doing, he would not be responsible in law for an act done while in such a state. If constant drunkenness has induced a state of mental disease rendering the accused unconscious of his act at the time, he is not responsible and can be declared insane. Where a special intention is necessary to constitute a particular offence, drunkenness might reduce the crime from a more serious to a less serious one.  Facts  The accused was charged before Mason J, and a jury at the Pretoria Criminal Sessions, with the crime of rape upon a European girl, of the age of ten years. It appeared from the evidence that the accused, at the time when he committed the crime, was under the influence of liquor. The presiding judge, in directing the jury, asked them to answer the following questions: Did the accused commit * the crime of rape; * an attempt to commit rape; or * indecent assault? The judge directed the jury that, if they answered one of the questions in the affirmative, they were also to answer the following question: Was the accused unconscious of what he was doing at the time he did it? The jury brought in the following verdict: \\"We find the accused guilty of indecent assault but are strongly of opinion that at the time he was not responsible for his actions.\\" The presiding judge thereupon asked the jury whether they meant that the accused was unconscious of what he was doing on account of being drunk at the time; the answer was \\"yes.\\" The matter then went to the TPD. The question reserved for that court was whether, upon this verdict, the accused should be acquitted or convicted or declared a criminal lunatic, under Proclamation 36 of 1902.  Argument  C. Barry, for the accused (at the request of the court), contended that the accused could not be declared a criminal lunatic, as in that case there must be a special finding of the jury as to his sanity or insanity. Drunkenness could mitigate the punishment.Van der Linden, Institutes 2.1.5.Moorman Over de Misdaden p. 21. Barry then cited some authority on the question of whether drunkenness was a defence.R v Fowlie 1906 TS 505.R v Smit 1906 TS 783.Halsbury, Laws of England Vol. 9, par. 516, 517, p. 242.M'Naughten's case (10 Cl. & F. 200, H.L.). A verdict of guilty but insane had been held to be equivalent to a verdict of not guilty.R v Felstead 1914 AC 534.Renton, Practice on Lunacy, p. 912. The same test which applied to lunacy, Barry argued, should logically, according to the English decisions, also apply to drunkenness.See also State v O'Donovan (61 Iowa 369). CW de Villiers Attorney-General for the Crown, argued that the jury was not entitled to go into the question of the responsibility of the accused; they must determine only the facts. According to Roman Dutch Law, drunkenness is no defence to a crime; it can only mitigate the punishment.Moorman (ibid), pp. 19, 21 and 22. If a person commits a crime when he is dead drunk, in a state of smoor dronkenschap, then not the ordinary punishment, but an extraordinary punishment, can be imposed.Matthaeus, De Criminibus, p. 30. The English rule was originally the same as South Africa's.R v Meade (1909, 1 KB 895). Barry replied.  Judgment  The TPD held, on a point of law reserved, that the finding of the jury amounted to a verdict of guilty: > If we admit the proposition that absolute drunkenness must be regarded as > equivalent to insanity, we are logically driven to the conclusion that > absolute drunkenness excuses a person from crime. Is it true that absolute > drunkenness is equivalent to insanity? I submit not.

They published two PC titles then closed their doors in 2001. In 2010, they reopened the company to work on a HD version of their most successful title, Toxic Bunny. 1994‚Äì2001 Celestial Games decided to work on two games when they originally started, Toxic Bunny and Arni the Mental Armadillo. They quickly realized that two projects were too ambitious and focused their team of four on their more popular idea, Toxic Bunny. The team worked on this project for a year and a half. Nick McKenzie and Travis Bulford worked on the development of the game, while Caleb Salsbury focused on the art. In 1996, a local game distributor Vision Software bought into the idea of Toxic Bunny and funded the last six months of development. When published, Toxic Bunny sold 7000 units in South Africa and a further 150,000 units internationally. After Toxic Bunny was published Celestial Games started working on a new title, The Tainted, a science fiction action role-playing video game. The Tainted sold a few thousand units. Celestial tried to keep its doors open for another year, but due to financial issues, decided to close the company. 2007‚Äì2010 In 2007, Travis Bulford and Nick McKenzie decided to port Toxic Bunny to Java. Realising its potential it went from being a small part-time production to a full-time production. As progress was made with the port, Bulford realized the opportunity available and started exploring new graphical avenues. It was at this point, in 2010, that Celestial officially opened its doors again with a new team of developers and artists production for Toxic Bunny was in full swing. 2011‚Äì2013 The production for Toxic Bunny HD was, at this point, moving quickly but carefully. Redrawing all the sprites and drawing all the levels was the team's top priority. The game was set for release in the first quarter of 2011, but due to the extent of changes made to the game, the release date was moved back to the 4th quarter of 2012. Toxic Bunny was eventually released in October 2012 at the rAge Gaming Expo and was distributed by Apex. In 2013, Sony made their Sony Mobile development kit available to developers around the world, which Celestial saw as the perfect opportunity to start porting Toxic Bunny to the PlayStation Vita.

Only one was built. Design and development The Hanriot HD.20 was an all-metal two bay biplane, though the inner bay was relatively narrow. Outward leaning parallel pairs of interplane struts, assisted by wire bracing, divided the bays. The wings had significant stagger and the lower plane had the greater span; in plan the wings were straight edged, unswept and of constant chord, with angled tips. Ailerons were fitted only on the upper plane and were short span and overhung, that is, their horn balances projected beyond the wing tips. The HD.20 had a braced, rectangular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and a small, curved edged fin. The elevators were balanced and the broad chord rudder, which met the flat top of the fin almost vertically, reached down to the keel and moved within an elevator cut-out. The fighter was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled upright V-8 engine. The pilot's open cockpit was over the trailing edge of the lower wing; both planes had central cut-outs to improve the pilot's view. A large Busteed inflatable buoyancy airbag between the undercarriage legs was provided for emergency landings on the sea. The HD.20 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by two pairs of V-struts. The HD.20 first flew in 1923 and flight testing explored its higher altitude performance, but then tests and development were ended.
