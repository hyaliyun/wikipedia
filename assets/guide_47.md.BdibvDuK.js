Montju√Øc is located just to the north of the old quarter of the city, near the confluence of the Onyar, Galligants, and Ter rivers. Montju√Øc is also the name of the present-day neighborhood and district of Girona on the hill. The name \\"Montju√Øc\\" translates from medieval Catalan as \\"mountain of the Jews\\". The hill has an altitude of 219 m. For much of Girona's history, Montju√Øc was uninhabited, the site of only the 17th century Montju√Øc Castle defensive bastion and the medieval Jewish cemetery of the city. Girona's Montju√Øc parallels the better-known Montju√Øc in Barcelona: a large hill adjacent to the city with a large castle fortress at the top dating to the mid-17th century and a medieval Jewish cemetery. Jewish Cemetery Gravestones originating from the cemetery of Montjuic, Girona, now at the Museum of Jewish History in Girona. The stone in the foreground dates to the 8th or 9th century. The Jewish community of Girona was flourishing by the 12th century, with one of the most important Kabbalistic schools in Europe. Because Jews could not be buried in Christian cemeteries, the authorities of medieval Girona created a special place for Jewish burials outside the city, but close to the city walls. The Jewish cemetery was on the western slope of Montju√Øc, and it existed as property of the Spanish crown. The earliest documentation of the cemetery occurs about the year 1200. From the Jewish Call of Girona, funeral processions would travel to the graveyard along a particular route. In 1492 all Jews were expelled from Spain by the Alhambra Decree. On July 14, 1492, the Jewish community gave the 400-year-old cemetery to the nobleman Joan de Sarriera, in gratitude for many favors he had done for them. In ensuing years, the gravestones of the cemetery, often large, shaped slabs of rock bearing a Hebrew inscription, were taken and used in construction projects around Girona. Some of these gravestones were recovered in the modern era and can be seen in the Museum of Jewish History in Girona. The cemetery was forgotten until 1862, when the railway line from Barcelona to France reached Girona. The railway path passed between the river Ter and the base of the west slope of Montju√Øc, and the cemetery was discovered when the railway construction unearthed 20 tombstones with Hebrew inscriptions. The cemetery suffered further destruction in the 1960s. At the present time there are no obvious indications that the Jewish cemetery existed at the site. The cemetery is bounded to the north and south by two minor Montju√Øc creeks. The southern creek is called Bou d'Or. This location is just to the east of the Pont Major neighborhood and the railroad line, and to the northwest of the Montju√Øc neighborhood. Montju√Øc Castle The ruins of Montjuic Castle. Montju√Øc Mountain lies to the north of Barri Vell, the old quarter of Girona. The Montju√Øc neighborhood surrounds the Castle, with its five outlying towers, dating to 1653. The ancient, abandoned Jewish cemetery is to northwest of the mountain. Montju√Øc Castle, located at the top of Montju√Øc, was built by order of Philip IV of Spain in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to protect the city of Girona. Construction of the castle began in 1653, consisting of a central fortification and four outlying defensive towers at about 500 m distance.The Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809, Edinburgh, John Ballentyne and Co., 1811, p. 768. At Google Books. Retrieved 3 August 2013. The towers were named Sant Joan, Sant Daniel, Sant Narc√≠s, and Sant Lu√≠s. The general plan of the central fortification is square, encompassed by four corner bastions. The walls between the bastions are about 150 meters in length. An additional outlying defensive tower was built in 1812, named after its builder the French Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet. Montju√Øc castle was used extensively in the Peninsular War (Spanish War of Independence) between Spain and France, 1808-1814. In particular, the castle was destroyed and fell to the French in August 1809 during the 7-month long Third Siege of Girona. By order of Suchet, the castle was abandoned at the end of the war in 1814. In 1843, during the Catalan popular revolt \\"Jam√†ncia\\", Montju√Øc Castle and the Suchet tower were destroyed by artillery on the orders General Juan Prim. Montju√Øc in the 20th century Montju√Øc and its Castle in 1911 as viewed from Girona Cathedral. Compare with the similar photo above obtained in 2019. The area around the fortress was undeveloped at the start of the 20th century. In the 1930s the City Council of Girona planned the first urbanization of the mountain, with a school and a city-garden for the working class. Planning was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), however. Under the Franco city councils, the project was abandoned. Although the mountain was declared a green zone in 1955, the Girona city council could not obtain the transfer of land from the castle, which was military property. In 1966 Ferran de Vilallonga bought the land and prepared a definitive urbanization. By then nearly 3000 immigrants from the rest of the Iberian Peninsula had settled on the hill in shanties. Between 1967 and 1971, after the expulsion of the squatters, a suburb was built for middle- to upper-class residents on Montju√Øc. Residential buildings ultimately covered the entire mountain, surrounding the ruins of the castle. In 1986 the population of Montju√Øc was 1381 inhabitants.

They started on 1October 2019, a date which was set by civil activists on social media, spreading over the central and southern provinces of Iraq; to protest corruption, unemployment and inefficient public services. The protest then escalated into full-scale calls to overthrow the administration. The Iraqi government has used live bullets, marksmen, hot water, hot pepper gas and tear gas against protesters, leading to many deaths and injuries. The protests stopped on 8October and resumed on 25 October. Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi announced on 29 November that he would resign. The protestors called for the end of the political system which has existed since the US-led invasion ousted Saddam Hussein and has been marked by sectarian divides. The protests are the largest incident of civil unrest since the fall of Saddam Hussein.  Background  In 2011, protests broke out in various provinces within Iraq demanding the end of corruption, nepotism, and unemployment, while also calling for increased wages and improved public services such as electricity, transportation, health care, education and municipal services. Protestors faced government suppression, police brutality and arrests. These reform demands in the six Sunni-dominant provinces escalated during the 2012‚Äì2013 Iraqi protests after Nouri Al-Maliki's acts of persecution against Sunni political figures. This, in turn, led to protests calling for the overthrow of the sectarian government and redrafting the constitution, as well as a march into Baghdad to occupy the Green Zone. These protests were faced with even more government suppression, leading to clashes between security forces and local tribesmen who had alleged support from Ba'ath Party loyalists. After reports of the Sunni factions, which were part of the Iraqi insurgency against the American occupation, unifying their powers and taking control over Al Anbar Governorate, the government launched the 2013 Anbar campaign. By July 2014, these factions which merged with ISIL had occupied most of Al-Anbar, Ninawa, Salah ad-Din, Kirkuk and Diyala which started the Iraqi Civil War. The U.S. Secretary of State pledged \\"intense\\" support to the Iraqi government while imploring the Government to rise above \\"sectarian motivations\\" but according to senior officials in the Department of Defense the U.S. was refraining from giving weapons to the Iraqi military \\"because of lack of confidence in Iraqi troops\\", while veteran U.S. journalists familiar with the situation claimed that Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki \\"is not the answer and should step down\\". Fueled by the lack of progress of Haider al-Abadi's government and state corruption, the leader of the Sadrist Movement, Muqtada al-Sadr, called for a sit-in within the Green Zone in Baghdad to force the government to find serious solutions for corruption. On 30 April 2016, thousands of Al-Sadr's followers breached the barricades of the Green Zone and stormed into governmental buildings, including the Iraqi parliament, chasing representatives out of the Green Zone before retreating the day after by the call of Al-Sadr. Another demonstration broke out in Basra and nearby cities in July 2018 due to deteriorating public utilities, water contamination and lack of electricity and continued for a few months. Protestors burned down a number of government buildings and parties' headquarters, blocked numerous main streets, tore and burned pictures of Khomeini and Khamenei and even occupied the Al-Najaf and Basra International Airports. They were faced with suppression from security forces and Popular Mobilization Forces, including Kata'ib Hezbollah, Badr Organization and Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, causing the death of at least 16 protestors. Remembering the rise of ISIS during the protests in 2012, these ones avoided sectarian rhetoric. Initially Americans had not seemed to be the focus of the anger although a 2019 poll found that only 22% of Iraqis had a favorable opinion of the United States, while 16% had a favorable opinion of Iran. However this preliminary assumption clearly turned out to be wrong when after a few months, hundreds of thousands rallied to oppose the US presence in the country.  Prelude  On 20 June in Basra demonstrators gathered outside the city's new administrative headquarters to vent their anger about poor basic services and unemployment. The old headquarters were burnt down during 2018's months-long protest. Basra and the surrounding region produce about 90 percent of the country's oil wealth but most of its residents have not benefited from it. Protesters blamed Basra's authorities for the city's problems, from a lack of job opportunities to unreliable and poor public utilities. Riot police were deployed at the scene but the protest remained peaceful. = Holders of higher degrees demonstrations = On 25 September 2019, a group of holders of higher degrees organized a protest in front of the Prime Minister's office in Baghdad, demanding their employment. The protest was faced with major suppression from security forces as armoured vehicles separated the demonstrators using hot water and police forces conducted random arrests among them which led to cases of fainting and injuries among the demonstrators. This incident was faced with country-wide anger because of the forceful methods that were used by the government towards intellectual demonstrators, along with the violence that was used against female protestors. Reactions included the Ministry of Interior forming a committee to investigate the incident and demonstrators organizing solidarity protests in many provinces to condemn these methods. The holders of higher degrees resumed their protests for three days after the incident, spreading over many southern provinces. = Dismissal of Abdel-Wahab Al-Saedi = On 27 September 2019, Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi issued a decision to transfer the commander of the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Force, Lieutenant General Abdel-Wahab Al-Saedi, from the ICTF to the Ministry of Defence, a decision that was viewed by many and by Al-Saedi himself as a demotion and an act of disrespect after being one of the major leaders of the liberation of Mosul from ISIL's occupation. Al-Saedi said the decision is an insult to his military rank and that he would rather go to jail than execute this decision. This decision caused political figures, including former prime minister Haider Al-Abadi and many representatives, to criticize Abdul-Mahdi and call for him to back down from his decisions. According to VOA News, Al Saedi's transfer was influenced individually by pro-Iran factions within the Al-Shaabi paramilitary force, said a government official in Iraq who asked to be kept unknown. After the decision was made, social media was flooded with Al-Saedi's photos and achievements, calling for Abdul-Mahdi to back down from this injustice and accusing Iran of ordering the Iraqi government to replace every \\"national hero\\" in the army with Iranian loyalists. In response to this backlash, Abdul-Mahdi said he stands by his decision and that it is a normal routine decision with no political motivations. Furthermore, after calls for the unveiling of a statue of Al-Saedi in Mosul that was made to immortalize the commander's efforts in the city's liberation, security forces surrounded the statue, prohibiting its unveiling, before it was finally removed by them. On 30 September 2019, Al-Saedi announced that he executed Abdul-Mahdi's orders and joined the ministry of defence as \\"a loyal soldier to serve my country and my beloved people.\\"  Causes, goals and methods  Starting on 25 October 2019, mass protests took place in many cities in Iraq, including Kerbala, against corruption and a national government that protestors saw as unaccountable for its actions. After the U.S. occupation (2003‚Äì11), oligarchs and warlords were perceived to have taken control over Iraq. While the country produces more oil than the United Arab Emirates, the oil revenues were seen by protestors as failing to be spent on maintenance of hospitals and roads. A widely used slogan in this phase of the protests was: \\"We want a homeland\\"‚Äîreflecting a longing both for a sense of unity and for a self- determined life in dignity. 'Sie wollen B√ºrger sein' (They want to be citizens). Die Zeit, 13 November 2019. Retrieved 28 November 2019. While at daytime protesters from all strata of Iraqi society peacefully took to the streets and squares of cities like Kerbala, later at night, youths from the suburbs sought violent confrontations, using molotov cocktails and burning car-tires, which was answered by the state security forces with tear gas, rubber bullets, deadly snipers and even patrol vehicles lethally ramming into crowds. =Assassination and intimidation campaign= Reuters reported that during the October protests, Iran-backed militia snipers were on Baghdad rooftops, according to two Iraqi security officials. A day after the October protests started, activists Hussein Adel al-Madani, 25 years old, and his wife Sara Talib, 24 years old, who had spent time in exile in Turkey, changed their address and ceased participating in protests, were assassinated in Basra by unidentified gunmen. Friends of the victims and security services told Thomson Reuters that the assassination had been ordered by an Iran-backed militia. Interviews by Thomson Reuters with officials and activists indicated a \\"pattern of mass arrests, intimidation and torture, and in some cases targeted killings of Iraqi protesters\\", with six activists \\"shot dead in or near their homes\\" over the year from November 2018 to October 2019, that was attributed by the interviewees to an Iran-backed militia. The activists had criticized the militias and been threatened for their activism. In November, gunmen in unmarked cars killed activist Adnan Rustum in Baghdad and another activist in Amara. An Iranian official contacted by Thomson Reuters said the claims of assassinations and threats by Iran-backed militias were \\"baseless\\". The Iraqi Prime Minister stated during a parliament meeting, ‚ÄúHuge demonstrations against me duly materialized and Trump called again to threaten that if I did not comply with his demands, then he would have Marine snipers on tall buildings target protesters and security personnel alike in order to pressure me. I refused again and handed in my resignation. To this day the Americans insist on us rescinding our deal with the Chinese.‚Äù Mahdi says he was also ‚Äúthreatened with false-flag sniper shootings of both protesters and security personnel in order to inflame the situation‚Äù, ‚ÄúAfter this, when our Minister of Defense publicly stated that a third party was targeting both protestors and security personnel alike (just as Trump had threatened he would do), I received a new call from Trump threatening to kill both me and the Minister of Defense if we kept on talking about this ‚Äúthird party‚Äù. Two Iraqi security officials contacted by Thomson Reuters stated the beating and electrocution of detained protestors, and the forcing of detained protestors to promise media silence were common. Iraqi government security spokesperson Abdul Karim Khalaf said that any evidence of torture should be investigated but no claims had been confirmed. The human rights committee of the Iraqi parliament called for an official investigation into the \\"' assassinations and kidnappings' of activists and bloggers.\\" Hassan Wahab of the Amal Association human rights group said, \\"Those [protestors] detained and released are only released on bail. Charges are not dropped so they face re-arrest and trial.\\" As of 23 December 2019, there were 29 assassinated activists related to the protests, most of them were in Baghdad. On 10 January 2020, an Iraqi journalist, Ahmad Abdelsamad, of Dijlah TV and his cameraman, Safaa Ghali, were shot in their car by unidentified gunmen. On 21 January, the police stated that Janat Madhi, a 49-year old activist was gunned down by unknown gunmen as she came back home from protests in the southern city of Basra, according to the Urdu Point. On 14 August, an activist, Tahseen Osama Al-Shahmani, was shot 20 times at his internet service company in Basra. On 19 August, a female activist, Reham Yacoub, was killed and three others were wounded in the city of Basra, when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their car. = Attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad = The US Embassy in Baghdad was attacked on the last day of 2019. The attack was organized and directed by Iran's proxy leaders Abu Mahdi al- Muhandis, Qays al-Khazali, Hadi al Amari, and Faleh al-Fayyad. They are seen in the pictures taken on the scene. Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, one of the leaders of the attack on the US Embassy in Baghdad, was condemned and spent years in jail in Kuwait for directing the December 1983 attacks on the US and French embassies there. For a long time, Iraqi anti-government protestors tried to enter Green Zone and were brutally suppressed and held back. On 31 December, groups of Popular Mobilization Forces (al-Hashd al-Sha'abi) entered the Green Zone and went directly toward the American Embassy without being blocked by security forces. US president Donald Trump accused Iran of \\"orchestrating\\" the attack on the embassy and added that they would be held \\"fully responsible\\". In the aftermath, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, Major General Qasem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were assassinated in a U.S. drone strike while traveling in a convoy near Baghdad International Airport. On 5 January in reaction to these airstrikes the Iraqi parliament called for the expulsion of US troops from the country.  Timeline 2019  = October = Protesters in Baghdad on 1October 1 October: Protests erupted in Baghdad in Liberation Square over high unemployment, poor basic services, and state corruption. These protests spread to the southern provinces. The authorities imposed an internet blackout and shut down 75% of the country's internet access. Protesters demanded the resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi and prepare for early elections. The protesters also began demonstrating against Iranian influence, and against the leader of Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani. At the beginning of the protests, the demonstrators were mostly young male, holding the government responsible for its many failures, according to vox. The Iraqi prime minister declared a curfew until further notice. 2 October: Two activists, Hussain Almadani and his wife, Sarah, were killed by unknown forces in their house in Basra. 3 October: According to Amnesty International, 18 civilians and one police officer were killed and hundreds were injured after three days of protesting. 4 October: In Nasiriyah, many headquarters of political parties were burned down. 5 October: Unknown forces raided many TV channels such as Al Arabiya, Dijlah TV, NRT and Al Rasheed TV for airing the protests. The forces destroyed these channels' properties. 7 October: Dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were injured in Sadr City. 8 October: Protests largely ceased due to Arba'een, a Shia religious holiday which occurred on 19 October. According to Arab News, regardless of warnings from the Iranian authorities for the pilgrims to procrastinate going on the pilgrimage to Iraq, 3.5 million Shiites, mainly Iranians entered Iraq through land borders on Friday. 24 October: Thousands of protesters began to congregate at Liberation Square in Baghdad, protesting against the government and against the Iranian influence.

The laws transitioned elections to a first-past-the-post system, which allowed voters to select individuals rather than use party lists, while the candidates would represent electoral districts rather than provinces. The new electoral law is expected to have representatives represent more local voices, as opposed to the entire governorate they were previously elected from, as well as stop infighting amongst list members and a myriad of small lists from siphoning off votes and failing to meet the electoral threshold. It would also prevent parties from running on unified lists, which had previously led some to easily sweep all the seats in a particular governorate. However, minority groups might end up being less represented, as they now have to obtain a plurality in the district they are running in, and the number of seats might not accurately reflect overall popular support. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy had previously endorsed this approach, although the Al-Bayan Center for Planning and Studies, an independent non-profit think tank in Baghdad, had proposed instead retaining the proportional system, but creating more districts so that each elected between three and eight seats each, which would retain the proportional aspect of seat allocation while binding representatives to more local areas. Most Kurdish legislators boycotted the meeting of the council, in opposition to changing the law. After its passage, legal experts, intellectuals, and some protestors suggested that the law as written might not work as intended, as there has not been a census to count population for the purpose of drawing districts in over two decades, and the parties might end up running candidates individually but then re-form parliamentary groups once the Council sits, effectively returning to the status quo. The new law apportions for the legislature to be shrunk to 251 seats (down from 329), says that the districts that are to be created must consist of over 100,000 people, and reduced the age of eligibility for candidacy to 25 from 30. One-quarter of seats would be reserved for women, and 9 would be reserved for national religious minorities. The law also established the Independent High Electoral Commission, which is to be composed of nine members, seven of whom would be judges from regular courts. In addition, there are two other judges from the State Council (administrative court). 26 December: President Barham Salih submits a letter of resignation after refusing to appoint Asaad Al Eidani as Prime Minister following the resignation of Adil Abdul-Mahdi. Salih stated that Al Eridani would not be approved by the demonstrators. President Salih added that since the constitution voids him of the right to refuse a nomination, he prefers to step down instead of accepting the nomination of a new prime minister that the protesters would reject. 29 December: The US bombarded Kata'ib Hezbollah positions in Iraq, killing 25 members of those Kataib forces and injuring 51 others. 31 December: Hundreds of pro-Iran protesters surrounded the US embassy in Baghdad in the Green Zone of the city where embassies and government buildings are concentrated, in protest over the US airstrikes in Iraq, two days earlier. Protesters elsewhere in Baghdad stated: \\"demonstrations at the US embassy are a natural response to the US strikes over Hashd positions in Iraq\\". However, they condemned the attack on the U.S. embassy by Iraqi supporters of the Hashd group saying, \\"we are staying here in the hub of the peaceful protest movement \\" and added that the \\"crowds in the Green Zone do not represent us. We want peaceful change.\\" Rumors speculated that on that day, some protesters had broken into the US embassy compound.

However, several anti-government protesters are concerned that Moqtada's call to force US military out of Iraq could surpass their separate, months-long protests that have disputed the grip on power by Iran-backed Shi‚Äôite groups. According to the Guardian, a statement by the influential Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr was read out by his representative on the stage at the place of the protest, calling for the closure of Iraqi airspace to US military and surveillance aircraft, the annulment of Iraqi's security agreement with the US, as well as the departure of all foreign forces from the country, and so on.

The restrictions were relaxed due to the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is expected to last until 22 May at the end of the holy month, The Jerusalem Post added. In Baghdad, movements will only be permitted from 6 am to 7 am from Sundays to Thursdays and all day long on Friday-Saturday. However, schools and universities are not expected to reopen and all flights will stay shut down, according to Reuters. Government buildings will only keep up the capacity of their staff to a maximum of 25%. =May= 7 May: The newly formed cabinet of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi was confirmed by the Iraqi parliament. 266 members of parliament out of a total of 329 members were present for the session, seeing to the approval of the majority of ministers submitted by al-Kadhimi. According to Kurdistan 24, only 5 out of 22 ministerial nominees were rejected by the parliament. The ministers rejected included those for agriculture, trade, culture, migration and justice. Since the resignation of the previous PM amidst large anti-government protests in November 2019, al-Kadhimi is regarded as the first real prime minister in Iraq. The new PM affirmed that his primary focus as prime minister would be to fight the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as bringing those responsible for the unlawful killing of protesters in anti-government protests to justice. The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed his support for the new cabinet during a call with al-Kadhimi, according to Reuters. 9 May: After the assumption of office on Thursday, the new Iraqi prime minister Mustafa al- Kadhimi presided over his first cabinet meeting. During the meeting, al- Kadhimi emphasized that his top priority as PM is to hold early parliamentary elections, by backing the Independent High Electoral Commission of Iraq (IHEC). Other vital issues such as health, security and economic situation were also addressed in the meeting. Kadhimi also reportedly held meetings with the ambassadors of both US and Iran, Matthew H. Tueller and Iraj Masjedi, VOA News added. Furthermore, with the exception of those accused of killings during the anti-government protests that lasted for several months, al-Kadhimi has promised that his cabinet will see to the release of innocent protesters that have been in detention. 10 May: Following the promise made by the new Iraqi prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi to free protesters that have been detained during the anti-government protests which began in October 2019, protesters gathered in hundreds in Baghdad's Tahrir Square. Despite the firm security put in place, several protesters also gathered in the streets of cities such as Diwaniyah, Muthanna, Wasit, Dhi Qar, according to the MEM. During the demonstration, the protesters called for immediate reforms by the government, prosecution of those accused of being responsible for the unlawful killings of hundreds of protesters. Meanwhile, protesters in the southern province of Basra called for governor Asaad al-Eidani's dismissal from office, alongside his two deputies, according to Kurdistan 24. The calls for the removal of the Basra governor were made after armed men opened fire at the building of Iranian-backed militia Thaa'r Allah, leaving one protester dead and four others wounded. Amidst the renewal of fresh anti-government protests in Iraq, the Supreme Judiciary Council on Sunday, issued a statement ordering courts to see to the release of protesters that were arrested since protests began last year. The release of the protesters by the Iraqi judiciary was ordered based on demands made by the new prime minister al-Kadhimi, the Washington Post added. Also, Mustafa al-Kadhimi promoted the Iraqi general Lt. Gen. Abdul Wahab al-Saadi who played a vital role in the war against Islamic State and was subsequently demoted last year by Abdul-Mahdi. May 11: Following the killing of one protester outside the building of a local party's headquarters in Basra on Sunday, Iraqi security forces raided the building, detaining at least five men accused of carrying out the shootings. Prime minister Al-Kadhimi confirmed that the raid by the security forces was carried out based on his orders in accordance with judicial warrants, Al-Monitor added. A statement from the White House revealed that President Trump spoke with the new Iraqi prime minister over the phone, in order to congratulate him on the endorsement of his new cabinet by the Iraqi parliament, according to Reuters. During the call, Trump pledged the support of the U.S. in assisting Iraq in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as combating ISIS. However, according to Kurdistan 24, a strategic dialogue between the US and Iraq is scheduled to hold in June, in order to strengthen their relationship. 18 May: The building of the Saudi-owned MBC channel in Baghdad was swamped by disgruntled protesters in response to the documentary broadcast by the channel, regarding the bombing of French and U.S. embassies in 1983. The angry protesters portrayed the documentary as an insult to the late Shia leader Abu Mahdi al Muhandis, which depicted him as a terrorist. Photos of al-Muhandis and Iraqi flags were waved by the protesters, demanding for the closure of the channel, as well as chanting slogans against Saudi Arabia during the protest. The MBC channel disclosed that no injuries were recorded during the demonstration, according to the Daily Star. According to Anadolu Agency, In an attempt to control the protest, security forces were dispatched to the site even though the demonstrators had already made their way into the building, severely damaging all equipment inside. However, there are no certainties as to whether the protesters who stormed the building are associated with any Iranian-backed organisation in Iraq. 23 May: A report from the Human Rights office of the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq, revealed the disappearance of over 100 people, with several others tortured by armed groups since protests began in October last year. All of the tortured or abducted victims were either involved in the anti-government protests or had provided a form of assistance to protesters, the UNAMI added.

The group has called on both the Iraqi and Kurdistan Region to enforce reforms of its penal code including other laws, such that they will be in accordance with international law. =July= 6 July: The renowned Iraqi expert on armed groups Hisham al-Hashimi was reportedly shot dead in the capital Baghdad. The incident took place near Hashimi's residence in the district of Zayouna, when two armed men riding a motorbike shot him, after which he sustained grave injuries and was taken to the Ibn Al-Nafees Hospital in Baghdad where he passed away. The CCTV footage of the incident suggested that Hashimi's killers were highly trained professionals, as they shot him several times at a point- blank distance, Arab news added. Iraqi security officials stated that prior to al-Hashimi's assassination, he was believed to have received threats from Iran-backed militias, according to the guardian.

Two pick up vehicles were used by unidentified persons to abduct the young activist Sajjad al-Iraqi, while leaving the other activist Basim Falaih wounded, after shooting him, according to eyewitnesses. Members of the tribe of deputy leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis who was killed by an American drone attack in January, are being held responsible by some activists in Nasiriyah for Sajjad‚Äôs abduction. However, security forces have managed to ID the location of the abducted anti-government activist by tracking phone calls, the state media disclosed. 21 September: Following the kidnapping of prominent Iraqi activist Sajjad al-Iraqi, Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi on Monday directed a joint operation consisting of a special anti-terror force and the army's air force to search for the activist who was taken by unknown gunmen in the southern city of Nasiriyah on Saturday.

Location This archaeological site lies on the southern side of the River Ayr near the B742 road that crosses the River Ayr at Gadgirth Bridge and runs up to Annbank. The castle jutts into the river on a rocky promontory with an islet located within the river at this point. Description Oldhall Woods and the site of Old Ha' The Gadgirth Old Ha' consists of a section of masonry held together with lime mortar set against the crag and another small section, circa 2.3m long and a maximum height of 1.5m high enclosing the area of circa 8.7m by 6m, apparently a corner of the building. On the sides not protected by the river are the remnants of a fosse, moat or ditch and a drawbridge is said to have been located here. The approximate dimensions of the main wall are 5.5m in length and 3.5m height. The historian John Smith in the 1890s visited the site and stated that only a short stretch of wall could be traced. The other castle in the district was at Martnaham. History Little is known of the history of this castle site, once held by the ancestors of the Chalmer, originally the De Camera family, which was replaced by their later 14th century Gadgirth Castle that stood around 500 metres or a quarter of a mile upstream on the same southern side of the River Ayr until demolished in 1808. Reginaldus de Camera (Chalmer) is recorded to have held the Barony of Gadgirth during the reign of William the Lion (1165-1214). References Notes; Bibliography * Campbell, Thorbjorn (2003). Ayrshire.

It aired on November 13, 2019, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Crystal Liu, and directed by John J. Gray. Plot In 2019, Richter's now-adult son Bobby returns to a decrepit Camp Redwood looking for answers, having been sent checks from an unknown benefactor since childhood. He is met by Montana and Trevor, who explain that Richter disappeared after being dragged into the lake and never returned. They reveal what happened in 1989: to prevent further deaths, Trevor blocks traffic to the Camp Redwood entrance. Margaret shoots him off camp property and leaves him to die, but Brooke appears and helps him onto the grounds so he can return as a ghost. Trevor's ghost then attacks Bruce and kicks him off the grounds to die. The dead counselors determine that the only way to stop Ramirez is to kill him over and over, which they do for thirty years. Back in 2019, Ramirez awakens once again and attacks Bobby; Montana ushers Bobby off the grounds and directs him to the asylum. There he meets Donna, now the director of the asylum, who further elaborates that in 1989, the ghosts brutally murdered Margaret, but not before Brooke seemingly died in a struggle with her. Donna and Bobby trace Bobby's money to a still- alive Brooke, who survived and escaped Camp Redwood with Ray's help. Bobby again returns to Camp Redwood where Margaret's ghost repeatedly attempts to kill him, but he is saved by Richter, Lavinia, and the counselors. Bobby shares a tearful farewell with his family and departs. Reception \\"Final Girl\\" was watched by 1.08 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 0.5 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. This episode had the fewest viewers of any finale in the entire series. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with some considering it to be the series' best finale in years. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Final Girl\\" holds a 83% approval rating, based on 12 reviews with an average rating of 8.33/10. Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"Moments of sweetness aside, 1984 is a dark comedy at its heart, and like the best '80s slashers, there's no shortage of dramatic practical gore effects and dismemberments. Witness the first time the ghosts fall on Richard Ramirez to hack him to death, or when the ghosts catch up to Margaret and dismember her before throwing her pieces into a wood chipper. [...] All the ghosts wanted, and all anyone wants, is a reason to keep on going, to not sink into malaise and longing. Keeping the devil's personal blade man trapped, watching over Bobby, working to undo the mistakes of the past and build towards a better future? [...] A bloody, nihilistic show about a bloody, nihilistic decade still ends with a little positivity and love.\\" He praised the director of the episode, commenting that \\"John J. Gray has a little fun with the ghosts this week, having them pop in and out of scenes, and appear in the middle of scenes just off-screen, and by having them move in between Bobby and harm as they chase down an escaped Ramirez\\", but also Wittrock's performance as he wrote \\"Credit to Finn Wittrock, who's not given a lot to do in the episode, but when he's called on for the father-son scenes, it's very touching, and his relationships feel honest with the well-meaning ghosts.\\" Kat Rosenfield of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A- rating. She first mentioned how she was pleased by the appearance of Finn Wittrock, saying that \\"our favorite and most chiseled horror story alum is here to explore the secrets of Camp Redwood.\\" She then wrote and commented how pleased she was by the fates of the final girls, Donna and Brooke, calling them \\"the finest of the final girls\\". She also enjoyed the multiple twists of the episode, especially the last one where the Richters appear and save Bobby from Margaret. Rosenfield noted the positive evolution of Montana's character, and the ghosts' attitude in general, noticing that they were \\"a much friendlier bunch\\" than before. Overally, Rosenfield really enjoyed the episode, and the season as a whole, commenting that \\"It‚Äôs been a long, strange, exceptionally stabby ride on this season of American Horror Story, but it all ends here.\\" References External links * Category:American Horror Story: 1984 episodes ","title":"Final Girl (American Horror Story)"},{"id":"62170114","text":"Bobby Brooks Kramer (December 1, 1913 - January 5, 2005) was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 2000. Life Bobby Brooks Kramer was born Bobby Brooks on December 1, 1913, in Terry, Montana. Kramer and her two brothers were raised on the family ranch in Prairie County, Montana, which was located near Big Sheep Mountain. All three children worked the ranch with their parents. Kramer made significant equestrian contributions in Montana in her lifetime. She started riding at the age of 3. She continued the traditions of ranching taught her by her parents and grandparents. On July 24, 1943, while Corwin \\"Bud\\" Kramer while still in the Army, he and Bobby got married. Kramer worked their ranch and competed in rodeo until he came home. Once he returned, they began building \\"one of the greatest horse ranches in the nation\\". Career Kramer attended several technical schools and got her pilot's license. The Kramers purchased a ranch near Billings. In 1968, Gary Crowder became a partner, starting the Kramer Crowder Horse Ranch. Kramer received a long list of accomplishments and awards during her lifetime. Many were from the American Quarter Horse Association, the Montana Quarter Horse Association, and the National Cutting Horse Association. After she and her husband retired from successful rodeo careers, they formed the Hanging Diamond A Horse Ranch. Kramer produced horses on the ranch who won awards in cutting, trail, reining, and pleasure riding. Legacy and death Kramer remained known for being one of the earliest women bronc riders who competed for prize money. She won several trophies and awards. Many of these came from cutting competition and horse shows. In the 1950s, she completed an endurance race from Billings to Miles City. In 1989, she rode with the drovers in a roundup on the Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive. Kramer also appeared in two documentaries: \\"I'll Ride That Horse\\" and \\"The Last Stronghold,\\" featuring the Miles City Bucking Horse Sale.

Librarians and collection Since the time of its foundation, its staff was formed by professional librarians who graduated from many American universities and the books were served to students of different levels from kindergarten up to university.  Importance The city's project followed a 1939 sit-in by African Americans and arrests at the whites-only Alexandria Library. The 1939 event is commonly cited as the first non-violent protest by African Americans against racial segregation.  Current status  Since the libraries were desegregated, Robert H.

Harland and Wolff built her and her sister ship in Belfast in 1936. Union-Castle Line operated Dunvegan Castle on scheduled services between Southampton and South Africa until 1939. When war broke out the Admiralty requisitioned Dunvegan Castle and commissioned her as HMS Dunvegan Castle. She escorted Allied convoys from Sierra Leone to Britain from January 1940. In August 1940 A German submarine torpedoed and sank her in the Western Approaches, killing 27 of her crew. Building and civilian service In 1935 Union-Castle ordered a pair of \\"intermediate\\" passenger liners for its service between Tilbury and South Africa. Harland and Wolff laid down the two ships with the consecutive yard numbers 959 and 960. Union-Castle policy was to name its ships after British castles. Hull 959 was launched on 25 January 1936, taking its name from Dunnottar Castle in Aberdeenshire. Hull 960 was launched on 26 March, taking its name from Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye. She was completed on 18 August 1936. Dunvegan Castle was a motor ship with two-stroke marine diesel engines. They developed a total of 1,931 NHP and drove twin screws, giving her a speed of . She had accommodation for 258 first class and 250 tourist class passengers. Except for her after hold, her cargo holds were refrigerated. Dunvegan Castle began her maiden voyage on 18 September 1936. It was a circuit of Africa including passage through the Suez Canal. She then settled down to scheduled services between Southampton and ports in South Africa. Armed merchant cruiser On 3 September 1939, the day the UK entered the Second World War, Dunvegan Castle was in East London in South Africa. The Admiralty requisitioned her there and sent her to the UK to be converted into an AMC. She called at Cape Town, and then at Freetown in Sierra Leone where she joined Convoy SL 2F to be escorted to home waters. Dunvegan Castle was back in Belfast from 16 to 25 December to be converted into an AMC. BL 6 inch Mk XII naval guns were fitted as her primary armament. Her secondary armament included QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns. Dunvegan Castle left Belfast on Christmas Day 1939. In January 1940 she briefly visited the Royal Navy bases at Portland Harbour, Portsmouth and HMNB Devonport. On 17 January she reached Autonomous Port of Dakar in French Senegal. The first convoy she escorted was SL 18F, a \\"fast\\" convoy that left Freetown on 28 January. On 8 February SL 18F joined the main part of Convoy SL 18 and Dunvegan Castle detached to return independently to Dakar. The ship next escorted Convoy SL 22, which left Freetown on 27 February and joined SL 22F on 11 March. Again Dunvegan Castle detached to patrol and then return to Dakar. For subsequent SL convoys Dunvegan Castle was an escort all the way to UK home waters. She was an escort of Convoy SL 26, which left Freetown on 30 March and reached Liverpool on 15 April. Then she was in Belfast from 14 April to 2 May. From May to July 1940 Dunvegan Castle escorted convoys SL 32, SL 36 and SL 39 from Freetown to Liverpool. Dunvegan Castles final visit to Dakar was on 8‚Äì10 June, between escorting convoys SL 32 and SL 36. France capitulated on 22 June, when Dunvegan Castle was escorting Convoy SL 36 to Liverpool, so when she returned to West Africa she went straight to Freetown to await Convoy SL 39. =Final voyage and loss= HMS Corinthian, an Ellerman Lines cargo ship that had been converted into an ocean boarding vessel Dunvegan Castles final voyage was with Convoy SL 43, which left Freetown on 11 August 1940.

The Red Deer Lake sawmill was one of Manitoba's three largest sawmills, with the other two being those at Grandview and The Pas.  History  The company began operations in 1901, and was founded by the following people: * Orlando A. Robertson, a real estate dealer from St. Paul, MN who invested $200,000 * Fredrick G. Barrows, a banker from Fergus Falls, MN who invested $100,000 * Fredrick B. Lynch, a real estate dealer from St. Paul, MN who invested $100,000 * Henry J. Box, a lumberman from Winnipeg, MB who invested $50,000 * William Henry Cross, a real estate dealer from Winnipeg, MB who invested $50,000 All five of the above became the first directors of the company, with Robertson being the President, and Lynch being the Secretary. The initial investments were used to build a sawmill on the south shore of Red Deer Lake. From the sawmill, a rail spur was also built to connect the mill to the Canadian Northern Railway line to the south, which had been built to Erwood in 1900 from Swan River. The company also created two settlements to serve the mill: the community of Red Deer Lake was built near the mill on the lakeshore, and the community of Barrows was built at the railway junction. By 1907, a controlling interest in the company was owned by Union Lumber Company from Chicago. The sawmill closed in 1926, and the company was then sold to The Pas Lumber Company, who received their permit to operate and restarted the Red Deer Lake Mill in 1928.  Operations  Wood for the sawmill was cut along the Red Deer River, and the logs were floated down the river to the lake when they were caught and then processed in the mill. Logs were also floated down the Etomami, Little Swan, and North Armit Rivers, which all eventually flowed into the Red Deer River. In the late summer and fall, an emphasis was put on getting logs cut. In the winter, once a snowpack was established, horse-drawn sleighs could be used to transport the cut logs from the fall down to piles on the nearest riverbanks. In the early summer, once the ice cleared on the rivers, the logs would be set in the river and the log drive would begin. Some of the logging areas had work camps where workers could live, and these camps could accommodate around 200 people per camp. Approximately 2000 people were employed by the company in total. The company owned a steamboat for transporting workers around the lake, and up and down the river, and various other barges known as \\"wangans\\" or \\"wannigans\\". The wannigans had flat bottoms for navigating shallow rivers, and a house in the centre with a kitchen and storage. Most of the lumber produced at Red Deer Lake was exported to the United States, but this practice stopped once the US closed their border to Canadian lumber, and this border closure was one of the factors that eventually led to the downfall of the company.

It is reputed to have seeded around 1100 and by the late 13th-century grew on the estate of Scottish independence leader William Wallace's father. Wallace is reputed to have hidden himself within the tree to escape from English soldiers. The tree was damaged by the removal of wood to make souvenirs in the 19th-century and it fell during a storm in 1856.  Association with Wallace  The oak is described as being at least 700 years old in a book of 1838, giving an approximate seeding date of 1100 AD. The tree stood at the west end of the village of Elderslie in Renfrewshire, to the north of the turnpike road. By the late 13th-century the tree came into the ownership of the father of Scottish independence leader William Wallace. William Wallace himself is said to have been born on the estate associated with the oak. In legend, Wallace is said to have used the branches of the tree to hide from an English patrol. This legend later became more outlandish, with it being stated that the tree hid 300 of Wallace's men. Its canopy has been variously described as covering and a Scottish acre (). The tree was well known by the 14th century and the Wallace Yew later grew next to it.  19th century  In 1825 the trunk was measured at in circumference at ground level, reducing to at a height of from the ground. It measured in height with branches extending up to to give a canopy covering 19 English square poles of land (). After this time the tree declined, partly due to age and partly due to parts of it being removed as souvenirs. By the mid 19th-century it had become common for Scottish men to own a snuff box that incorporated a fragment of the Wallace Oak together with part of a tree said to have been planted by Mary, Queen of Scots at Holyrood Palace, part of another tree under which she is said to have watched the Battle of Langside and a portion of the rafters of Alloway Auld Kirk (made famous by Robert Burns). By 1851, when it was drawn by Jacob George Strutt for his Sylva Britannica, many of its branches had been removed and it was described as \\"a melancholy torso, bald and frail, with its limbs hacked off by relic hunters, like Wallace's by the hangman\\". The tree fell during a storm in 1856. Its timber was reputedly used to make two regency-style tables. John McAdam commissioned an elaborate frame made from the oak in 1867 which he intended to be used to contain letters about Wallace at the National Wallace Monument.

His career has been hallmarked by controversy, including claims of being a second generation clone created by the Bahamian company ClonAid.  Early life  Santiago was born on April 11, 1988, at St. Elizabeth Child Care Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. He later moved with his fraternal twin brother, Jason, and his mother to South Florida, specifically the Hialeah and Opa-locka areas, in search of a better life. As a child, Santiago took martial arts classes. He attended public school before being home-schooled. He recalls the death of friends in harsh neighborhoods as well as having little food as motivators for a better life. He is of Sicilian and Puerto Rican descent.  Personal life  Prior to his rap career, Santiago had been cited for child abuse in 2008. Santiago was arrested when he was 19 after he got into a fight with his then-underage girlfriend. She was also the mother of their child, who was only two years old when the incident occurred. The pair eventually got violent, and Santiago punched her in the face while their child was present. He denied these claims but plead guilty to child abuse, intimidation, robbery, and criminal mischief. He was sentence to two years of probation. In late 2017, Santiago changed his stage name from \\"Humongous The God\\" to \\"Kid Buu\\", in reference to his favorite Dragon Ball Z character, and for his love of anime. The \\"Majin\\" tattoo between his eyes, his fangs and his pink hair further promote this persona.

It is thought to be around 1,000 years old and is described as the oldest oak in North West England. It is reputed to have been the setting for a medieval hundred court and said to have been damaged in an 1864 gunpowder explosion. The tree won the 2019 English Tree of the Year competition and has been entered into the 2020 European Tree of the Year competition.  History  The Allerton Oak is around 1,000 years old and is thought to pre-date the Norman Invasion of 1066. It is situated in what is now Calderstones Park, Liverpool, and is thought to be the oldest oak tree in the North West of England. The tree has a girth of and is thought to be in good health, producing some 100,000 acorns each year. The Allerton Oak is said to have been the site of a medieval hundred court that sat beneath its branches, though some believe that the nearby neolithic burial monument at Calderstones (demolished in the Victorian era) is the more likely site for the court. The tree is also reputed to have been damaged in 1864 when the merchant ship Lottie Sleigh, carrying 11 tonnes of gunpowder, exploded on the River Mersey, some away. The detonation blew out the windows of the nearby Calderstones Manor and is said to have caused a large crack in the trunk of the tree which has weakened it structurally. The tree and the land it stands on was owned by Henry and Charles MacIver from 1875 until 1902 when they gifted it to the Liverpool Corporation to form Calderstones Park. The tree became a landmark and during the Second World War local soldiers were sent acorns and leaves from the tree as good luck tokens from friends and family; as a result seedlings of the tree are thought to have been grown across the world. A report on the tree in 1970 suggested that it would be dead by 2020 due to rot in its trunk; despite this the tree as of 2014 was said to be thriving. The branches of the Allerton Oak have been supported with metal props since 1907 and it is fenced off to protect it. Liverpool City Council and Mersey Forest are undertaking an ¬£80,000 project to replace the props with a modern support system that will be adjustable to accommodate the tree's growth. In 2007 an acorn from the tree was planted as its successor and the new tree has become known as \\"Allerton Oak the Younger\\". The pair are the only two sessile oaks in the park. The Woodland Trust described the Allerton Oak as \\"a spectacular example of a city tree\\" and valued it at ¬£500,000 in 2019.  Tree of the Year  The Allerton Oak was entered into the Tree of the Year competition in 2019. The tree won the England category with 34% of the 11,000 votes cast and was selected from all the British national winners as the national entry into the 2020 European Tree of the Year competition. The tree won a ¬£1,000 grant from the People's Postcode Lottery to help pay for its maintenance.

He is best known for a 1950 article on cybernetics which proved influential for the early reception of cybernetics in the Soviet Union. Biography Agapov was born on and spent his childhood in Tbilisi, where he graduated from the Department of Philology at Tbilisi State University in 1922. Having been secretary of the Caucaus Bureau of the Russian Telegraph Agency from 1921‚Äì22, Agapov moved to Moscow in 1922 to continue his career as a journalist. Agapov began his career here as the member of the group of constructivist poets, the , but soon moved on to less radical grounds. From the 1930s, the subjects of his works were mostly recent advances in Soviet science and Soviet construction works, though he also published articles on education and a travel journal. In 1950 he was the editor of the Soviet newspaper, Literaturnaya Gazeta. In 1967, Agapov summarised his view of art as \\"primarily a tool of communication\\". One event in Agapov's career that has gathered much attention was the publication of an article on cybernetics in 1950. In the wake of the formation of NATO, Agitprop against American culture was ordered to be intensified, giving rise to a scramble among Soviet journalists to find more original ways to present anti-American views. On 4 May 1950, Agapov published \\"Mark III, a Calculator\\" in Literaturnaia gazeta. This article ridiculed the interest in computers and cybernetics in post-war America, mocking American capitalists who \\"love information as American patients love patented pills\\" singling out Norbert Wiener (the founding thinker of cybernetics) for his support of American capitalists' \\"sweet dream\\" of replacing workers with robots. He commented on a recent issue of Time (23 January 1950), depicting the Mark III dressed in American military clothing on its cover, as making it \\"immediately clear in whose service [it] is employed\\". This issue of Time was Agapov's only source in writing the article, having never read any of Wiener's actual work. According to historian of science Slava Gerovitch, though it never mentioned cybernetics by name, this \\"article had a profound impact on the reception of cybernetics in the Soviet Union\\" and was \\"evidently taken as a 'signal' of the official negative attitude toward cybernetics\\", beginning a Soviet ideological campaign against cybernetics. It was not until the death of Stalin that the role of cybernetics would be reevaluated by Soviet scientists. Its significance has been questioned by scholar Valery Shilov, instead proposing 1952 article as the beginning of the campaign against Soviet cybernetics. Agapov was also a writer of several Soviet documentaries. In 1946, Agapov feared disapproval from Stalin over his role (though minor) as one of the writers of the prohibited film, Great Life; this fear dissipated, as Valery Shilov mentions he became, evidently, a \\"man who could be trusted to fulfill important and responsible Party tasks\\". Agapov was twice the recipient of the USSR State Prize for his scripts for these documentaries: first in 1946 for The Renaissance of Stalingrad (1944), then in 1948 for The Day of the Conquering Country (1947). Agapov died on 6 October 1973, in Moscow. Reception and legacy The third edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1970‚Äì79) assessed Agapov favourably, citing him as \\"one of the pioneers of the Soviet industrial sketch genre\\", characterised by his \\"broad generalizations and a poetic treatment of science\\". Slavic studies scholar Wolfgang Kasack was less flattering, pithily summarising that \\"he wrote uninteresting stories devoted to the socialism building [...] [and] was [a] popularizer of actual events in economics and science\\".

Widowed two weeks after the birth of her son, the mother in 1776 married retired Major Mikhail Kologrivov. She treated her son strictly and coldly, but the influential court lady Marya Perekusikhina fell in love with the \\"funny and pungent\\" boy and, by order of Catherine II, in 1783 he was enrolled in the Page Corps moving from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. The main focus was on teaching secular communication, French, fencing, dancing and horseback riding. Thus, from infancy, Prince Golitsyn had access to the courtyard, where at first it was valued as a participant in the children's games of the Grand Dukes ‚Äì Alexander and Constantine, and then ‚Äì as a witty and clever gentleman. His brother (by father) Mikhail Golitsyn, who took the place of the Yaroslavl governor, built the estate of Karabikha (now a museum-reserve) under the city. Another brother (by mother), Dmitry Kologrivov, accompanied the undersized prince Golitsyn in his mischief. Both brothers very skillfully imitated the manners and reprimand of others. Count Fyodor Tolstoy wrote:Fedor Tolstoy. Notes by Count Fyodor Tolstoy, Comrade President of the Imperial Academy of Arts // Russian Antiquity, 1873 ‚Äì Volume 7 ‚Äì No. 1 ‚Äì Pages 24‚Äì51 Career After graduating from the Page Corps in 1794, he was received as the lieutenant in the Preobrazhensky Regiment. But a year later he returned to the court and became a chamber junker of the small court of Grand Duke Alexander Pavlovich, and in 1796 he was transferred to the large imperial court. In 1799 he received the rank of chamberlain and in the same year became commander of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He was expelled from Saint Petersburg by Emperor Paul I in the same year for an unknown reason. After the accession to the throne of Alexander I, Prince Golitsyn, as a person close to him, was appointed first as Chief Prosecutor of the I and later III Departments of the Senate, and then on October 21, 1803, at the insistence of the emperor, assumed the post of Chief Prosecutor of the Holy Synod. In 1810, while maintaining his former position, he became the head of the foreign confessions, in 1816 ‚Äì the Minister of Education. Partly under the influence of Rodion Koshelev, this Epicurean and Volterian of Catherine's training, elected in 1806 as a member of the Russian Academy, turned to piety with a pronounced sentimental-mystical color. He easily undertook to explain to the emperor the most complex theological questions, although he knew the history of religion superficially and considered true Christianity \\"foggy sentimental pietism mixed with Orthodox dogmas, various heretical and sectarian teachings\\". Moscow Metropolitan Philaret recalled: Egor Botman. Portrait of Prince Alexander Nikolayevich Golitsyn Having proclaimed piety as the foundation of true enlightenment, Golitsyn headed for the clericalization of education, which under his leadership was zealously pursued by Mikhail Magnitsky and Dmitry Runich. He was suspicious of contemporary literature, which was expressed in the extreme censorship. After in 1817 the departments of spiritual affairs and public education were merged into one ministry ‚Äì the Ministry of Spiritual Affairs and Public Education ‚Äì Golitsyn became the head of the latter, but was relieved of the post of Chief Prosecutor. Since 1810, Alexander Golitsyn was a member of the Council of State, and during 1839‚Äì1841 ‚Äì Chairman of General Meetings. He was one of the few to whom the secret of the abdication of Konstantin Pavlovich was entrusted. He headed the Philanthropic Society, took part in the organization of the Guardians of Prisons Society and other philanthropic endeavors. House of Prince Golitsyn on Fontanka, 20 In addition to the reform of theological schools, the establishment of the Russian Bible Society took place under Prince Golitsyn, which, under the presidency of the prince, translated the Bible into Russian and distributed more than 400,000 copies of it. The employees of this society, Popov, Magnitsky, Runich, and Cavelin, were appointed by Golitsyn to direct higher education, where they instilled clericalism; many professors were fired for lack of piety. Magnitsky demanded to completely close Kazan University ward to him. Although it was customary to associate the triumph of reaction with finding Golitsyn at the helm of the ministry, it was with him that the Saint Petersburg University and the Richelieu Lyceum were established. On August 9, 1821, the Russian Emperor Alexander I established the Siberian Committee and Count Golitsin was included in its first composition.Siberian Committee // Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary: in 86 Volumes (82 Volumes and 4 Additional) ‚Äì Saint Petersburg, 1890‚Äì1907Siberian Committee // Great Russian Encyclopedia: [in 35 Volumes] / Editor-in-Chief Yuri Osipov ‚Äì Moscow: Big Russian Encyclopedia, 2004‚Äì2017 To neutralize the influence of Alexander Golitsyn on the emperor, Aleksey Arakcheev led an intrigue under him with the participation of Metropolitan Seraphim and Archimandrite Photius, who convinced Alexander I that Golitsyn's administration was detrimental to the church and the state. His enemies triumphed on May 27, 1824, when Prince Golitsyn was to resign in both departments, retaining only the title of chief over the postal department. He held the last post under Nicholas I, who valued in Golitsyn \\"the most faithful friend of his family\\". Over the years, his religiosity only intensified. A contemporary recalls: In 1843, Count Golitsyn, due to visual impairment, left the capital and retired to Crimea, where he died in his estate of Gaspra. In the same Golitsyn Palace, Leo Tolstoy later wrote the novel \\"Hadji Murad\\". He was buried in the Balaklava Saint George Monastery. Personal life Golitsyn spent his whole life a bachelor and was known for his intimate relationships with men.See Commentary to Alexander Pushkin's epigram \\"Here's the Tail Protector...\\" Nikolai Yazykov in a letter of 1824 cites an anecdote, \\"as if the sovereign had called for the famous sodomite Bantysh-Kamensky and ordered him to compile a list of all his acquaintances on this part, that Bantysh-Kamensky presented him with such a list, starting with the Minister of Education, then there was the chancellor and so on... After that he had an audience with the emperor and certified him oath in the truth of his report\\".Nikolay Yazykov.

It opened in the late 19th century and served as the filming location for the first Venezuelan film, Un c√©lebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa, in 1897. Later, it was converted into other hotels with different names, most notably the Hotel Zulia, before being demolished in 1956 for the construction of the Maracaibo municipal building. History The Hotel Europa opened at the end of the 19th century. It was situated at the south corner of Plaza Bol√≠var in the center of Maracaibo, facing the square. The building it occupied had been standing for a long time; it was considered at its time \\"the most beautiful\\" in the city. It had previously been the home of the Italian Consul, Don Francisco Fossi. =Hotel Europa= The hotel was reportedly popular because of its efficient service, comfort, and the respectable management. The hotel was also considered prestigious, as it had many modern amenities and guest rooms were spacious with \\"all-American comfort\\" pieces including full bathtubs and marble-tiled showers. There were also suites for family visitors. The restaurant was ventilated and offered live music; the menu reportedly offered an extensive selection of European dishes and had a well-stocked service of \\"the most exquisite liquors\\" available. The hotel was advertised to offer good service for a reasonable price; this countered the main concerns of visitors to the area, which were reported as typically expensive yet dirty. The location of the hotel was also prime, situated near the center of the city, as guests could listen to the military displays taking place in Plaza Concordia from their balconies on Thursdays and Sundays; this was seen as an exclusive attraction of the city. In 1897, the hotel was the filming location for the first Venezuelan-produced film, Un c√©lebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa. Later reports state that an innovation of hotels at the time, particularly the more modern Hotel Europa and its similar Hotel Los Andes, was to have on-hand medical services for foreign guests. =Later functions= The Hotel Europa became the Hotel Zulia in 1913, which was accessed from the street Calle de las Ciencias. This hotel was financed by Do√±a Concha Iriarte, and had two storeys, with the guest rooms on the top floor. It was advertised as for \\"families, tourists, traveling agents, [and] oil tycoons\\". Typical rates at Maracaibo hotels in 1931 were $6 to $8 per day. The hotel was known as a meeting point for high society of the time, where guests and visitors could hear the music of Juan Delgado, Eduardo Perich, Mar√≠a de √Ångela, Carmelita Su√°rez, and their students. It saw some refurbishment in 1928, opening the Zulia Tea Room on the ground level; this was a patisserie designed by Hermes Romero, a Zulian architect. However, by the 1930s, Do√±a Concha had left the business and it had become the Hotel Am√©rica. This hotel served largely traveling businessmen and baseball players from elsewhere, as it was close to both the city center and the Estadio del Lago in La Ciega. The building then passed to ownership by the municipal council and was retained as an administrative headquarters before being demolished in 1956 to construct a new Maracaibo municipal council building that would replace the entire block.

Her work considers how people value and use the environment, the impact of social justice on environmental policy and establishing ways to change social practise.  Early life and education  Pickerill studied geography at the Newcastle University. She moved to Scotland for her graduate studies, where she specialised in geographic information systems at the University of Edinburgh. She returned to Newcastle for her doctoral degree, where she earned her PhD in geography in 2000. During her PhD, Pickerill worked briefly at Lancaster University where she worked on a project with Bronislaw Szerszynski.  Research and career  Pickerill started her independent research career at Curtin University in Perth. Here she studied the internet activism of Australian environmentalists. Pickerill was made a lecturer in human geography at the University of Leicester in 2003. She spent 2008 as a Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute. She moved to the University of Sheffield in 2014. Pickerill works on environmental geography, in particular, how people use and value the environment. This aspect of her work has involved the use of social science, investigating the complicated relationships between humans and the environment. Pickerill has explored grassroots initiatives that tackle environmental challenges. She has studied how environmental activists share their understanding of the environment using technology and how they frame their message. She is also interested in environmental activists who choose to protect one aspect of the environment whilst ignoring another. Her work recognises that environmental issues often overlap with other aspects of inequality; including racism, colonialism and neo-liberalism. Often activist movements incorporate populations of a range of social categories, and Pickerill has looked at its role in the Occupy movement, anti-war movement and the environmental movement in Australia. Pickerill has studied the impact of experimental solutions on environmental challenges and role of students in redesigning their future. This has included ways to self-build safe, environmentally friendly housing. She has revealed that women are not well represented in eco-building communities. She is currently investigating the potential for eco-communities in environmentally friendly, sustainable cities.

A lateral line is a system of sensory organs in aquatic animals such as fish, that serves to detect movement, vibration, and pressure gradients in their environment. An artificial lateral line is an artificial biomimetic array of distinct mechanosensory transducers that, similarly, permits the formation of a spatial-temporal image of the sources in immediate vicinity based on hydrodynamic signatures; the opurpose is to assist in obstacle avoidance and object tracking.... The biomimetic lateral line system has the potential to improve navigation in Under-water Vehicles when vision is partially or fully compromised. Under-water navigation is challenging due to the rapid attenuation of radio frequency and Global Positioning System signals. In addition ALL system can overcome some of the drawbacks in traditional localization techniques like SONAR and optical imaging. The basic component of either a natural or artificial lateral line is a neuromast, a mechanoreceptive organ that allows the sensing of mechanical changes in water. Hair cell serves as the basic unit in flow and acoustic sensing. Some species like arthropods use a single hair cell for this function and other creatures like fish use a bundle of hair cells to achieve pointwise sensing. The fish lateral line consists of thousands of hair cells. In fishe, a neuromast is a fine hair-like structure that uses transduction of rate coding to transmit the directionality of the signal.;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Each neuromast has a direction of maximum sensitivity providing directionality.  Biomimetic features  = Neuromast = In the artificial lateral line, neuromast's function is carried out by using transducers. These tiny structures employ various systems such as hot-wire anemometry, optoelectronics or piezoelectric cantilevers to detect mechanical changes in water. Neuromasts are primarily classified into two types based on their location. The superficial neuromast located on the skin is used for velocity sensing to locate certain moving targets, whereas Canal Neuromasts located below the epidermis enclosed in the canal utilize pressure gradient between the inlet and outlet for object detection and avoidance. Fishes use superficial neuromast for rheotaxis and station holding as well. Simplified Hot-wire sensor Out of all the sensing techniques employed, only hot-wire anemometry is non directional. This technique can accurately measure the particle motion in the medium but not the direction of flow. However hot wire anemometer and the data collected is adequate to determine particle motion up to hundreds of nanometers and as a result is comparable with a neuromast in similar flow. The figure is a depiction of a simplified hot-wire sensor. Current carrying conductors undergo increases in temperature due to Joule heating. The flow around the current carrying wire causes it to cool and the change in current required to restore the original temperature is the output. In another variant, the change in resistivity of the material with respect to the change in temperature of the hot wire is used at the output. Figure 2: Sectional view of lateral line in fish and its components =Division of labor= There is a division of labor technique employed in these systems wherein superficial neuromasts located on the epidermis senses low frequencies as well as direct current (flow) while the canal neuromast located beneath the epidermis enclosed in canals detect alternating current using pressure gradients. In these systems wherein superficial neuromasts located on the epidermis sense low frequencies as well as direct current while the canal neuromast located beneath the epidermis enclosed in canals detect alternating current using pressure gradients =Cupula= Cupula is a gelatinous sack covering over hair like neuromast protruding from the skin. Cupula formed over neuromast is another feature that developed over time that provides a better response to the flow field. Cupular fibrils extend from the hair-like neuromast. Cupula helps attenuate low- frequency signals by virtue of its inertia and amplify higher frequency signals due to the leverage. In addition, these extended structures provide better sensitivity when the neuromast is submerged in the boundary layer. Recent studies uses drop casting, wherein dripping of HA-MA solution over the electrospun scaffolding to create a gravity driven prolate spheroid shaped cupula formation. Experimental comparison between the naked sensor and the newly developed sensor reveal positive results =Canals= Canal Neuromasts are enclosed in canals that run across the body. These canals filter out low- frequency flow that could saturate the system. A certain pattern is found in the concentration of neuromasts along the body among of aquatic species. The canal system is found to be running along the body in a single line that tend to branch out near the head. In fishes, the canal location is suggestive of the hydrodynamic information that is available during swimming. The exact placement of canals varies across species, a suggestive sign of functional role rather than developmental constraint =Canal distribution along the body= Commonly, the canal concentration peaks near the nose and drops significantly over the rest of the body. This trend is found in fish of varying sizes that occupy different habitats and across a variety of species. Some studies hypothesize the close connection between canal location and bone development and how they are morphologically constrained. The exact placement of canals varies across species and can be a suggestive sign of functional role rather than developmental constraint. =Canal flexibility= The flexibility of the canal system has a significant effect on low-frequency signal attenuation. The flexibility of the sensing element placed in the canal system may add to the sensitivity of the Canal Artificial Line (CALL) system. Experimental data proves that this factor creates a significant jump in the sensitivity of the system. Geometric improvements in the canal system and optimizing the sensing equipment for better results. =Constrictions in Canals near neuromast= At higher pressure gradients, the voltage output of devices with wall constrictions near the sensors in the canal lateral line( CALL) were much more sensitive and according to Y Jiang, Z Ma ,J Fu, et al their system could perceive a pressure gradient as low as 3.2 E‚àí3 Pa/5 mm comparable to that of Cottus bairdii found in nature. Additionally, this feature attenuates low-frequency hydrodynamic signals. Applications Navigation in shallow water bodies present a challenge especially for submersible vehicles. Flow fluctuations may adversely affect the trajectory of the craft making on-line detection and real time reaction an absolute necessity for adaptability. Progress in the field of artificial lateral line has benefited various fields other than underwater navigation. A major example is the field of seismic imaging. The idea of selective frequency response in superficial neuromast has encouraged scientists to design new methods to develop seismic images of features under the ocean using half the data to generate images with higher resolution compared to traditional methods in addition to saving time required for processing Similar systems Electrosensory lateral line (ELL) employs passive electrolocation except for certain groups of freshwater fish that utilize active electrolocation to emit and receive electric fields. It can be distinguished from LLS based on the acute difference in their operation besides similar roles Integumentary Sensory Organs (ISO‚Äôs) are other sensory dome-shaped organs found in the cranial region of crocodiles. It is a collection of sensory organs that can detect mechanical, ph and thermal changes. These mechanoreceptors are classified into two. The first of which is Slow Adapting receptors (SA) that sense steady flow. The second is Rapid Adapting receptors (RA) that sense oscillatory stimuli. ISO can potentially detect direction of disturbance with high accuracy in 3D space. Whiskers in harbor seal is another example. In addition some microorganisms use hydrodynamic imaging to predate.

After seeing service in both World War I and World War II, the regiment continues to serve within the City of London. History In 1907, Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane announced a series of reforms, which would affect mostly the Volunteers and Yeomanry. These two groups were merged to form the \\"Territorial Force\\". On 1 April 1908, the force was born. These reforms created fourteen divisions, fourteen mounted brigades, and coastal defence groups. As part of these reforms, all of the volunteer battalions were renamed to lose their \\"volunteer\\" title and gain regional or regular titles. Following these sets of reforms, the 4th London Field Ambulance was formed from the Woolwich Companies, Volunteer Medical Staff Corps. Following the formation of the Territorial Force, the 47th (2nd London) Division was formed, and the regiment assigned to the Royal Army Medical Corps group within the division. After being brought up to strength the regiment had the following structure; * Regimental Headquarters, The School of Ambulance Woolwich * A Section, Woolwich * B Section, Erith * C Section, Dartford * Transportation Section, Woolwich =World War I= Following mobilisation each regiment had the following organisation; * Regimental Headquarters (including the regimental corps of drums band) * Advanced Dressing Station ‚Äì maintained 10 stretcher bearers plus drivers and wagon orderlies * Main Dressing Station ‚Äì supported by drivers and wagon orderlies * Regimental Aid Post ‚Äì maintained 22 stretcher bearers * 2 Collecting Posts ‚Äì maintained 22 stretcher bearers each 1/4th London Field Ambulance Following general mobilisation, the 1st line regiment moved to St Albans within the same unit. By 8 March 1915, the regiment was moved to France and based in B√©thune where they were joined volunteers from the 2nd line regiment. By 9 May the regiment was involved in the Battle of Aubers Ridge where they saw service supporting troops returning from service on the front. By the 15th the regiment was based in Chapelle St Roch where they participated in the minor allied victory of the Battle of Festubert. On 25 May the regiment moved to Loos where they helped in the Battle of Loos which was the first allied battle which attempted to break the front-line stalemate. The regiment later took part in the Actions of the Hohenzollern Redoubt which would be a British defeat within a larger British victory. On 21 May 1916, the ambulance took part in the pivotal Battle of Vimy Ridge which resulted in a British defensive victory during a major German operation. During late summer of 1916 the British army moved to the area around the Somme where they consolidated for a possible massive assault on the German lines, this became known as the Battle of the Somme where tanks were used for the first time during combat. The regiment also saw service during the later Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette. Following the end of this engagement the regiment moved south to the \\"High Wood\\" or Bois des Fourcaux where the regiment assisted in the 47th (2nd London) Division during the Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette where they were assisted by tanks of the 1st Battalion, Heavy Branch Royal Machine Gun Corps later the 1st Royal Tank Regiment. On 1 October the regiment moved north to the town of Feucourt l'Abbaye where they assisted the Fourth Army's HQ during the later stages of the Battle of the Somme. The regiment also took part in the later Battle of the Transloy Ridges. On 7 November the regiment moved slightly north to take part in the late stages of the Battle of the Somme during the Attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt. Following their involvement in the latter stages of the Battle of the Somme, the regiment moved north to the town of White Chateau where they took part in the Battle of Messines which would collapse the French troop's morale leading to many mutinies and revolts. A month later, in July, the regiment was based in Westouter where they took part in the dual Third Battle of Ypres and Battle of Pilckem Ridge where the regiment again assisted the Fifth Army during the operations to take the ridge. By 18 August the regiment moved north-west to Westhoek where they participated in the later stages of the battle. In September the regiment joined the I Anzac Corps and relieved the 25th Division where they participated in the subsequent battles and actions. By 28 November the regiment was again moved south to the area around Bourlon Wood which proved to be an inconclusive battle with resulted in taking an important railway which was one of the major junctions for the supply of the Hindenburg Line. The regiment continued to be stationed in this area during the subsequent counter-attack. In 1918 the regiment saw more service, first during the Battle of St. Quentin as a result of the German Spring Offensive becoming known as Operation Michael, which saw the largest artillery bombardment of the war. During this time the regiment was re-attached to the Fifth Army and based around Marcoing. On 24 March the regiment moved west to the town of Rocquigny where they supported the British army's rearguard following their withdrawal during the end of Operation Michael. Following this withdrawal, the regiment along with the army started becoming increasingly dis-organised. The regiment continued to move west to the south of Aveluy where they held a defensive position during the Battle of Ancre which caused the ending of Operation Michael. Following their defensive victory the regiment was ordered south-west to Bray-sur-Somme where they continued to hold a defensive position which became known as the Battle of Albert. The result of this battle was the start of the end for the war moving the tide of war in the allies favour. After these battles the regiment moved east to Maurepas where they were able to stop the German Spring Offensive causing a hold-off during the Second Battle of Bapaume. By 2 October the regiment moved north-west to Aubers Ridge where the regiment was part of the initial movement east during the Final Advance in Artois. The regiment continued to move east where they took part in the Final Advance in Artois and Flanders in Lille. After moving to Lille the regiment was told that the 1918 Armistice with Germany was announced, thus ending the war. After the announcement of the end of the war, the regiment moved back to London where it was placed in suspended animation.  2/4th London Field Ambulance  After general mobilisation was called the 4th London Field Ambulance formed a 2nd line regiment based in Chelsea where they joined the 179th Brigade. On 4 January 1915 the regiment moved to Dorking where they continued to train and get prepared to possibly move overseas. By March the regiment was in Watford and then to Saffron Walden. In 1916 the regiment was based in Sutton Veny where they were told they were to mobilise and be prepared to move to France. On 22 June the regiment embarked for France where they arrived to Ecoivres near the Vimy Ridge. After moving the Arras area the regiment was assigned to the area north of the town, where there was especially fierce fighting. Following their arrival, the French suffered some 150,000 casualties in the area while trying to take the Vimy Ridge. On 21 May the British forces experienced some 2,450 casualties, the regiment then saw service on the front-line for the first time. Following their involvement in the battle, the regiment moved to Maizi√®res where they took part in the Battle of the Somme and on 28 June the regiment moved to Ecoivres. While being based in the area the regiment was tasked to support the 179th Brigade and 180th Brigade through their advanced regimental aid post and Collecting posts. During mid-1916 the regiment received orders to move south to Marseille where they have transported aboard HMS Transylvania headed for Salonika. After moving to Greece the regiment was assigned to the 60th (2/2nd London) Division in preparation for operations on the Bulgarian Front. After arriving the regiment saw about four months of relative quiet and relaxation, which just a few raids from the enemies. During this time the allied armies prepared for an attack against the Bulgarians by the area of Lake Doiran near the Greece/Macedonia/Bulgaria border. Between 24 April and 22 May, the regiment saw service in the subsequent actions in the area, which came to be known as the Battle of Doiran. During this battalion, the allies lost many men with little to show in return. In late November the regiment moved to the area where they were happy to find that the railways in the area were modern and very easily accessible, which made transporting injured soldiers very easy. Between 30 June and 4 July 1918 the regiment was broken up, where it was finally demobilised and disbanded. =Postwar= In 1920, following the disbandment of the Territorial Force and subsequent re-formation of the new Territorial Army the regiment was re-formed as the 4th London Field Ambulance and two years later renamed as the 140th (County of London) Field Ambulance. Following its reformation the regiment was assigned to the also recently reformed 44th (Home Counties) Division and based at the Duke of York's Headquarters. There does not seem to be any records to sources available to see what division/assignments the regiment had, but it did see service in the following; North African Campaign, Operation Husky, and the Allied invasion of Italy. =Modern day= In 1945 all territorial units were placed in suspended animation, and in 1947 the Territorial Army was re-formed. Following this re- formation the regiment was reformed as the 47th (Home Counties) Field Ambulance later being renamed as the 47th (Godalming) Field Ambulance. In 1958 the TA went through some major re-organisations with the regiment amalgamating with the 131st (Home Counties) Field Ambulance to become the new 47th (Home Counties) Field Ambulance. In 1966, the TA went through a major re- organisation and many reductions, becoming the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, as a result, the regiment was renamed as the 221st (Surrey) Field Dressing Station, then becoming a field ambulance again in 1969. In 1992 the major Options for Change reforms were announced with many units being disbanded or amalgamated. As a result of this the regiment amalgamated with the other home counties units, 217th (London) General Hospital and 257th (Southern) General Hospital to form the new larger 256th (London) Field Hospital, later being renamed as the 256th (City of London) Field Hospital in 1996. In 2005, the regiment joined 2nd Medical Brigade.

History Perfect Day was incorporated on April 28, 2014 under the name \\"Muufri\\", and was re-named \\"Perfect Day\\" in 2016. The Bay Area company was originally focused on the production of dairy goods (such as cheese or yogurt) for direct retail sale to consumers. The name Perfect Day is a reference to the Lou Reed song of the same name. Production Perfect Day announced in late 2017 that they had been negotiating with possible food industry partners whether they might incorporate their manufactured protein into existing food production lines, becoming a business-to-business ingredient company and marking a change in their business strategy of targeting the end-user (consumer). In November 2018, the company announced a joint development agreement with Archer Daniels Midland to provide commercial-scale volumes of non-animal whey protein. On July 11, 2019, Perfect Day released its first product, an ice cream made from non-animal whey protein. The launch was limited to 1,000 3-pint bundles available for $60 and sold exclusively through the company's website. The production run sold out within hours. As of October 2019, the company has not announced plans to re-release its ice cream. Technology To produce whey and casein proteins from non-animal sources, Perfect Day bioengineered microflora to include DNA sequences that instruct the cells to produce proteins that are conventionally found in cow's milk. The microflora are then grown in fermentation tanks where they convert a carbohydrate source such as corn sugar into flora-based dairy protein. Similar recombinant technology is used elsewhere in the food industry, including to make rennet (a common cheesemaking enzyme) and heme. The resulting protein, once separated from the genetically modified microflora, has the same organoleptic and nutritional properties as its animal-derived analog. After they are separated and dried into a powder, the proteins are used as ingredients in other foods that conventionally contain dairy protein. Backing Perfect Day raised $61.5 million between 2014 and 2019, primarily supported by Horizons Ventures, a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm, and Temasek Holdings, the investment company that manages the government wealth of Singapore. For their Series C investment round, the company announced they had raised an additional $140 million in December 2019, and this amount was expanded to $300 million in July 2020. =Research awards= The Postcode Lottery Green Challenge awarded the company a runner-up prize of ‚Ç¨200,000 (roughly USD $225,860) in September 2015. Ongoing controversy Some US dairy industry advocates have expressed concern that Perfect Day products will confuse consumers if their labels do not clearly distinguish them from products made from cows. To prevent potential consumer confusion, many US dairy farmers have petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to enforce the definition of milk as the \\"lacteal secretion from milking one or more healthy cows\\", which would prevent Perfect Day from referring to their product as milk.

It was deemed \\"\\"significant as one of a very limited number of houses designed by the Kaysville architect William Alien, that is virtually unaltered. William Alien was the only architect in Davis County at the time that the Layton house was designed, and continued to be the leading architect in the county until the 1920s. The Layton house also documents the use of pattern book house types in the late nineteenth century, and it is the same pattern that Allen used in the John Henry Layton house in West Layton, and possibly in the Joseph Adams house in East Layton. Of the three houses the George W. Layton house received the most ornate program of ornament, and thereby records one extreme of the stylistic possibilities of pattern book design. The complexity of the brick and wood ornamentation, and its unaltered and well preserved condition make the George W. Layton house one of the most distinctive Victorian pattern book houses in Utah. In addition, Layton, who is credited with the resident's actual construction, served in a number of capacities within the community.\\" It is Late Victorian in style and is located at 2767 W.

He was sent from Ifrƒ´qiya to oppose the Umayyad ruler  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I. He landed in Tudmƒ´r and demanded the submission of SulaymƒÅn ibn Yaq·∫ìƒÅn al-Kalbƒ´ al-A ørƒÅbƒ´, commander of Barcelona. When this was refused, he marched against him and was defeated near Valencia. Shortly afterwards he was assassinated by a Berber. His was the last effort by the Abbasids to assert their rule in al-Andalus.Roger Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì797 (Basil Blackwell, 1989), pp. 174‚Äì177. Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b was a member of the Fihrid family, which was prominent in Ifrƒ´qiya. A Fihrid, Y≈´suf ibn  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn al-Fihrƒ´, was the governor of al-Andalus deposed by  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I in 756.Pierre Guichard, \\"The Population of the Region of Valencia During the First Two Centuries of Muslim Domination\\", in Manuela Marin (ed.), The Formation of al-Andalus, Part 1: History and Society (Ashgate, 1998), p. 143. According to some modern historians, Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b was also related by marriage to Y≈´suf, but this is not supported by any primary source.Abdurrahman A. El-Hajji, \\"Andalusian Diplomatic Relations with the Franks during the Umayyad Period\\", Islamic Studies 30 (1991), pp. 241‚Äì262. Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's nickname, al-·π¢iqlƒÅbƒ´, literally means \\"the Slav\\", but according to Ibn  øIdhƒÅrƒ´ it was given to him not on account of his origins but because of his tall height, fair complexion and blue eyes. The region of Tudmƒ´r in southeastern Spain, which Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b made his base of operations, was originally an autonomous Christian tributary under Theodemir, who gave his name to the region. It was still under the rule of Theodemir's son Athanagild as late as 754. Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's decision to target Barcelona when the centre of Umayyad power, C√≥rdoba, lay closer to Tudmƒ´r is difficult to explain. Possibly Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b believed there was more support for the Abbasids among the Yemenis of the northeast and hoped by his challenge to Ibn al-A ørƒÅbƒ´ to draw them to his following. The 11th-century Collection of Anecdotes on the Conquest of al- Andalus places Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's arrival shortly after  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I had defeated a Yemeni rebellion in Seville, so perhaps he judged that his base of support near C√≥rdoba had been too weakened for an immediate attack on the centre. The Arabic sources are inconsistent in dating Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's arrival in Spain. The Collection of Anecdotes placed it around 775, but Ibn al-Athƒ´r writing in the 13th century placed it in 778. Collating the Arabic and Latin sources, Roger Collins places it in the early 770s. Antonio Ubieto Arteta, accepts a date of 161 AH, which fell between 9 October 777 and 27 September 778.Antonio Ubieto Arteta, La Chanson de Roland y algunos problemas hist√≥ricos (Anubar, 1985), p. 108. Pierre Guichard, basing his conclusion on Ibn al-Athƒ´r and al- øUdhrƒ´, places Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's arrival in 161 (777). Guichard believes he held out in Tudmƒ´r for several months before being forced to hide out in \\"the mountains of the land of Valencia\\" until his assassination in 163 (779). According to the Collection of Anecdotes, the Berber who assassinated him, S·∏•a øƒÅn, had ingratiated himself with Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b for just that purpose. Having killed him, he led the pro-Abbasid cavalry over to  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I.David James (ed.), A History of Early al-Andalus: The AkhbƒÅr majm≈´ øa. A Study of the Unique Arabic Manuscript in the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France, Paris, with a Translation, Notes and Comments (Routledge, 2012), pp. 106‚Äì107 and p. xv (map). Some modern historians have linked Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b to the embassy sent by al-A ørƒÅbƒ´ of Barcelona and ·∏§usayn of Zaragoza to Charlemagne, king of the Franks, in 777. This search for an alliance abroad against  øAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn I precipitated the Frankish campaign that ended in disaster at the battle of Roncevaux Pass. Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's involvement, however, is chronologically impossible as well as incongruous with al-A ørƒÅbƒ´'s cool reception to Ibn ·∏§abƒ´b's overtures.

It represented the noble class and the season of autumn, and the Japanese even had a Chrysanthemum festival. When the flower was adopted for the Imperial Seal of Japan some families also cultivated it to signal their support and good relationship with the Imperial family.

Biography  = Early life = Konstantyn Franciszek Korniakt was born in So≈õnica in 1582, the son of the noble Polish merchant Konstanty Korniakt (the elder, b. 1520, h. Krucina) and Ruthenian noblewoman Anna Dzieduszycki h. Sas. Konstanty Korniakt (the elder) had moved to Lviv in 1554, inheriting the property of his elder brother Michael Kornakt. By 1566 the Polish king Sigismund II Augustus had granted him the privilege to import and sell Greek wines, cotton, Moldavian honey, cowhides and furs, and Western cloths. On February 12, 1571, king Sigmind II Augustus ennobled Konstanty Korniakt (the elder) granting him the Krucina coat of arms. by which time he was the wealthiest inhabitant of Lviv, and one of the greatest patrons of Lviv Renaissance architecture. Konstantyn Franciszek had five siblings: Aleksander, Michal, Anna (m. Jan Tarnowski), Zofia (m. Abraham Herburt), and Katarzyna (m. Aleksander Chodkiewicz). Konstanty (the elder) was a ardent follower of the Eastern Orthodox Church but had good relations with the Jesuits. However the children became polonized, converted to Catholicism, and the sons studied at the University of Padua in Italy. By the time of his death Konstanty (the elder) had accumulated about 40 villages, 2 towns, and crown lands including estates in Lw√≥w Land and Przemy≈õl Land. = Establishment at Bialoboki = After his father's death on August 1, 1603 Konstantyn Franciszek Korniakt sold his inherited Lw√≥w Land estates including some left to his brother Aleksander. Konstantyn then consolidated and moved to the Przemy≈õl Land of the Ruthenian Voivodeship where he owned three fortified estates at So≈õnica, Z≈Çotowice and Bia≈Çoboki. Korniakt's large estate at So≈õnica in the county of Jaros≈Çaw included a manor built around 1580 which was able to repel the frequent attacks of large bands which were common in the area. Korniakt (junior) added a residential wing with an entrance gate from the west to the old north wing. Security was improved by a 140 cm thick wall and vertical escarpment. Until 1605 the family kept their valuable items at this castle The village of Bialoboki near Przeworsk was where Konstanty (junior) established his residence and family stronghold. He assumed the name \\"Konstanty Korniakt of Bia≈Çobok\\" and by 1608 had built a small castle on a hill on the site of a former stronghold. The new castle was constructed of brick on a rectangular plan and was surrounded by a moat and swamps and could only be accessed via a drawbridge. The interiors were beautifully decorated and equally well equipped. The floors were made of white stone, as were the sides of the castle. = Dispute with Stadnicki = Konstanty Korniakt (junior) had inherited a mortgage of the town of Lancut which had been issued by his late uncle Michael Korniakt for 17,000 zlotys. This mortgage had been assumed by Stanis≈Çaw Stadnicki \\"the devil of ≈Åa≈Ñcut\\" who had long contested the debt in the royal court. Stadnicki's debt had increased by another 30,000 zlotys for bail after he was sentenced for failure to appear in royal court. After the death of Konstanty Korniakt's father Stadnicki seized his opportunity and invaded the villages of Krzemienica, Czarna and Albigowa where he robbed the peasants and burned the farm estate. Stadnicki threatened the heirs if they didn't forgive the 47,000 zloty debt. So Korniakt transported the family treasury with a reserve of money and his mother's jewelry to his more fortified but unfinished castle in So≈õnica. On the evening of July 29 1605 this castle was attacked by Stadnicki with 1500 attackers who over two days captured and plundered the castle, kidnapping Konstanty, his wife and daughters. The building had been stripped of everything, including doors and windows. > \\"Infantry hit the castle gates, the riders launched an attack from the > commons where there were neither moats nor walls. At the same time the > cannonade was opened and a terrible shout was made in the wake of trumpets > and war cauldrons. Soon the gates of the castle were assaulted with > cannonballs and assault axes, the infantry invaded the castle and > immediately hung its banner on the tower as a sign of triumph. In a moment > the castle was full of Stadnicki's soldiers, who rushed to the shops, the > caskets, the wardrobes, because the first main goal of such a mercenary > party was to rob their own hand.

The entire amount of Korniakt√≥w > cash was plundered, and the sum was great, which was reported and kept > intact during bad adventures, putting a hundred and forty thousand zlotys > lightly in hiding\\" The women were stripped of what they were wearing, earrings torn off, and two of Konstanty's mother's fingers cut off so they could take expensive rings including her wedding ring and signet ring. Stadnicki kidnapped and kept Konstanty Korniakt with his wife and daughters in the dungeon of his castle at ≈Åa≈Ñcut for 8 weeks where they were chained, mistreated and the women were raped. Stadnicki kept the family in the dungeon until Korniakt and his mother signed an agreement for waiver of debts, claims for stolen valuables and damages from the raid on Sosnica. After his release Korniakt took refuge behind the walls of Lviv and from there he filed new lawsuits for robbery and imprisonment. However this again raised Stadnicki's anger. Korniakt's lawyers Adam Zhidovsky and Andrei Svidnitsky, who were conducting the case, miraculously escaped from the city of Przeworsk with their lives. Then in 1606 Stadnicki, with his armed force of 1200-2000 freely entered Lviv and forced Korniakt to re-sign the waiver. In 1608 Korniakt built the brick castle at Bialoboki. Stadnicki attacked the castle and there is a legend that after a long fight broke through. But Korniakt managed to escape through a tunnel leading from the castle to the village of Gaƒá. There, a peasant helped him and in disguise he took him to a safe castle in Chodak√≥wka. Stadnicki became involved in wars with other neighbors and during this time the Kornyakts managed to win four court cases against him. Stadnicki's debt to Korniakt grew to 212 thousand zlotys, but the court reduced the amount of payments by half to encourage a settlement. After the death of Stanislav Stadnicki in August 1610 Korniakt continued to fight with Stadnicki's three sons and a brother - the Belgian governor Adam Alexander Stadnicki. = Participation in Wars = However, Konstantyn Korniakt of Bia≈Çobok was neither innocent nor defenseless. During the Polish-Swedish war in Livonia (1600-1611) he participated in the Siege of Fellin (May 1602, Viljandi, Estonia), fought in the army of field crown hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski at the Battle of Reval (June 1602, Tallinn, Estonia), and with Jan Karol Chodkiewicz at Battle of Weissenstein (September 1604, Paide, Estonia). Korniakt was also well known for his private wars with neighbors. In 1603 he wounded captain Stanis≈Çaw Branicki (d.1620) with a saber. From 1608 he attacked his neighbor Marcina of Goraja Czury≈Çƒôj in Ujkowice, seized the estate of Annƒô JaksmanickƒÖ of Fredr√≥w, imprisoned nobleman Jaczewskiego, captured the marketplace Przemysl and with the help of Adam ≈ªydowskiego, killed Marcina Sadowskiego. In 1609 he attacked and killed the chorƒÖ≈ºy of Rudnitsky with his 16 servants, taking their property. = Marriage and Children = Konstantyn Franciszek Korniakt married El≈ºbieta Ossoli≈Ñska (d. 1646), the daughter of Jan Zbigniew Ossoli≈Ñski - the voivode of Sandomierz. Konstantyn and El≈ºbieta had the following children: * Anna Korniakt (1608-1648) who married Miko≈Çaj Ossoli≈Ñski *Karol Franciszek Korniakt (1610-1672) who in 1664 married Katarzyna Be≈Ç≈ºecka (1620-), daughter of the Podole Governor Aleksander. * Aleksander Zbigniew Korniakt (1612-1639) who married Dorota CzarnkowskƒÖ (1610-1639). = Death and afterward = In June of 1624 the Tatars invaded the Przemysl region. As they destroyed the villages they established themselves in a ravine that would someday be called Wolica. Konstantyn Korniakt of Bia≈Çoboki died from wounds during this invasion as a defender of the Polish lands. He was buried in the Dominican church in Przemy≈õl. Although the Tatars captured most of the local population as jasyr, they were later intercepted and dealt a crushing defeat at the Battle of Martyn√≥w. When he died Konstanty Korniakt of Bia≈Çobok left the majority of his estates in the Przemy≈õl region to his daughter Anna and son-in-law Miko≈Çaj Ossoli≈Ñski. This included 29 villages and one city including the key of Rybotycze, the castle near Przemy≈õl, and the properties of Husak√≥w and Mi≈∫nice. Rybotycze became the main residence from which Miko≈Çaj made trips to the surrounding area and maintained a regular army there, recruited from the surrounding villages. Konstanty's eldest son, Karol Franciszek Korniakt owned 11 villages in the Przemy≈õl region with his base at Bia≈Çoboki. In the summer of 1630 Karol enrolled at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w and traveled extensively (Germany, Italy, France, Spain, England, Belgium, Holland). He studied military affairs and languages, notably at the University of Graz in Austria, and at University of Padua in Italy (1639). Karol participated in the Polish campaigns and battles and fought in many wars. He financed companies during the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1657). He commanded his own company at the Siege of Zbarazh in 1649, and the Battle of Berestechko in 1651.

It ended with the Bohemians' defeat and with Poland acquiring the territory of Silesia.  Prelude  Bohemian‚ÄìPolish relations had worsened following the death of the wife of Mieszko and Bohemian princess Dobrawa in 977; this marked the end of the Polish-Bohemian alliance. Until the mid-980s the rulers of both the Polish and Bohemian states supported the Holy Roman Empire's Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, but their alliance did not last into the second half of that decade.  The war  Early Piast Poland in the end of the reign of Mieszko I, , showing Silesia as part of Poland). The town of Niemcza, acquired by Mieszko in 990, can be seen in the lower left part of the Polish territories shown on the map. The war was fought likely for the purposes of territorial expansion, with Polish ruler duke Mieszko I taking over the lands of the Vistulan tribe (Lesser Poland area, with the major settlements of Sandomierz and Krak√≥w) in the years 998-999. The Bohemian duke Boleslaus II contested Mieszko's actions, and their armies clashed in Silesia. The Bohemians received aid from the Veleti, while the Holy Roman Empire helped the Poles and after a short conflict the Bohemians were defeated, with Mieszko also acquiring Silesia for Poland (with territories around Krosno and Niemcza). There are relatively few accurate historical accounts from this period, and much of the account of the war is based on the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg and archaeological discoveries.Henryk ≈Åowmia≈Ñski, PoczƒÖtki Polski, vol. V; A. Buko, Ma≈Çopolska \\"czeska\\" i Ma≈Çopolska \\"pola≈Ñska\\" Thietmar, however, while devoting some space to the conflict itself, did not discuss the reasons for it, which modern historians can only speculate about. There is also evidence that Mieszko might have controlled parts of Silesia as early as mid-980s,Andrzej Buko, \\"Archeologia Polski wczesno≈õredniowiecznej\\", 2007, Ed. Trio. and it has been speculated that the reason for the war might have not been over Lesser Poland, but about the territorial disputes in Silesia itself.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It is a stone house probably built around 1873, probably by Charles Duncan (stonemason) (1823-1891) and son John Samuel Duncan. Charles was a Scottish-born stonemason who helped build the Salt Lake Temple during the 1863-67 portion of its construction. \\"In 1852 the entire family sailed across the ocean on the Kennebec; arriving in the Salt Lake valley in September 1853.6 When the Duncans first arrived in Utah they lived with friends in Centerville for a brief time. Charles soon purchased land in Kaysville, and he moved the family there in the spring of 1854. Charles built a log cabin where his twin sons, John Samuel and Charles Jr., were born on May 22. The crops failed, and the family returned to Centerville in July. Word of Charles skill as a stonemason spread quickly; he was hired to build homes throughout the Centerville and Farmington area. Charles' career in masonry spanned from 1853 to 1891. Charles taught the trade to his three sons, John, Charles and Archibald. Most of the early rock buildings and culverts in South Davis County were built by the Duncans. Additionally, Charles worked for many years cutting stone for the Salt Lake City L.D.S. Temple which was constructed during 1863-67. A common, 'trademark' feature of the rock homes built by the Duncans is frequent use of quoins made from granite or sandstone. Charles brought back to Centerville pieces of stone which had been discarded or deemed unsuitable for the L.D.S. Temple. He used these stones to add decoration, as well as religious symbolism, to the residences in Centerville. Charles and his wife Margaret lived in the seven room stone house at 558 N. 340 E. with his son Archibald.7 Charles passed away in April 1891.8 John Samuel worked with his father, Charles Duncan, in building the Classical style stone house c.1873. It reportedly was originally one large room with the adobe interior partitions added later. John bought the house from his father in 1888. According to the 1880 census records, John, age 26, lived with Harriet (Hattie) M., age 22, his wife, and Hattie M., age 2, and George W(alter) age 4/12, his two children, presumably in this house. In 1900 he was living with Eliza Jennett (Jennie), his second wife, and two children, Walter and Erma. Eliza Jennett was born in 1864 and died in August 1918. It appears that Harriet died prior to John's marriage to Eliza Jennett, however, it is unknown.9 In 1926 this house was sold to Harold Duncan, a son of John and Eliza Jennett born in 190410 . Little is known about Harold. The house was then sold to John and Harriet's son, George Walter, in ....\\" Does it have Saltbox architecture, see :Category:Saltbox architecture in Utah \\"The house is built of local stone which the pioneers of Centerville called 'mountain rock'.2 A brick chimney pierces the roof peak at the east end. There are asphalt shingles on the roof and there is a simple wood soffit and fascia. The facade of the house, or south elevation, is symmetrical with a door in the center and matching wood, two-over-two double hung windows on either side. The door and windows are constructed with sandstone lintels; there are sandstone and granite quoins on all four corners and on the corners of the north shed roof addition. The front porch is not covered, consisting only of a concrete slab at the threshold which is approximately eight inches high. There is a shed addition to the rear, or north, which was built very soon after the main block of the home. The shed roof extends out from the eaves of the main building, giving the house the appearance of a saltbox type residence. This addition contains a bathroom and a kitchen, and has a brick chimney at the west end.\\" Other structures on the site include a second contributing building, located directly to the north of the main house, which was reportedly the first house here. It is a one-room rock building. Also a carport/open garage was added in 1932. And a rock-built shed/storage addition to its west has stonework not matching the Duncans', and was apparently built by a different mason.

It stands in the Piazza della Vittoria, in the centre of Formia, a town on the coast of the Province of Latina beside the Tyrrhenian Sea, about southeast of Rome and northwest of Naples The high structure comprises a monumental bronze statue mounted on a tall white marble pedestal, standing on a plinth with two steps. The bronze statue entitled Sacraficio depicts a soldier, larger than life size, wearing an Adrian helmet, and trousers with puttees and boots, but bare-chested, standing with both arms raised, as if offering himself in sacrifice. The pedestal has a carved decorative frieze around its top edge, and the front has a carving of a female figure bearing a palm frond and holding a laurel branch over a dedicatory inscription \\"AI CADUTI / PER LA INDIPENDENZA E LA GRANDEZZA DELLA PATRIA // FORMIA / ORGOGLIOSA E RICCONOSCENTE\\" (\\"To the fallen / for the independence and greatness of the fatherland // Formia / proud and recognising\\"). On the rear are the inscriptions \\"DORA OHLFSEN / SCULTRICE / 1924\\" and two lines from the 1818 poem All'Italia (\\"To Italy\\") by the poet Giacomo Leopardi: \\"ALMA TERRA NATIA, / LA VITA CHE MI DESTI ECCO TI RENDO\\" (\\"Dear land of my birth, / The life you gave to me here I give back.\\"). The sides are inscribed with the names of 120 war dead from Formia, killed in the First World War and earlier conflicts, including the Battle of Lissa (1866), the Battle of Adwa (1896), and the Italo-Turkish War (1911‚Äì12) The Australian sculptor Dora Ohlfsen-Bagge (1869‚Äì1948) received a commission from the Italian government to create the sculpture around 1923, reportedly due to her friendship with Duke (1874‚Äì1939). It is claimed that she was the only woman in Italy and the only non-Italian to have been awarded such a commission. She first completed a plaster model, which was then cast in bronze, reportedly using bronze from captured guns, and completed around February 1925. The model for the bronze statue may have been Fulco's son Luigi Tosti di Valminuta (1871‚Äì1958). The memorial was unveiled on Sunday 18 July 1926, at a ceremony attended by the Italian government minister , Marshal Armando Diaz, Admirals and , the Archbishop of Gaeta, war veterans, and a large crowd of spectators. An Italian navy vessel in the harbour fired a salute. The strong masculine sculpture was considered a fitting commemorative work by the Fascist government of Benito Mussolini. There was suggestion that the statue should be removed in the Second World War, so the bronze could be reused in the war effort, as despite the work's historical and patriotic value, it was said to have little artistic value. In the event, the memorial remained in place. It was restored in 2008.

She was the founder of the Winnipeg General Hospital Nursing Alumnae and member of the first legislative committee that helped establish the Manitoba Association of Graduate Nurses. Early life and education Stewart was born in 1878, the fourth oldest of nine children. She came from a family of Scottish descent, due to the heritage of both her parents. Career Stewart attended and graduated from the Winnipeg General Hospital Training School for Nurses, but was disappointed by the lack of hands-on training and education. She thus enrolled at Columbia University Teachers College and earned a bachelor's and master's degree. Stewart and Mary Adelaide Nutting, the principal of the School of Nursing, led the National League of Nursing's The Standard Curriculum for Schools of Nursing. By 1925, she took over the program after Nutting's retirement, and became the Helen Hartley Jenkins Foundation Professor of Nursing Education and Director of the program. After her retirement, the Teachers College announced a professorship in her name, titled the \\"Isabel Maitland Stewart Research Professorship of Nursing.\\" In 1928, Stewart directed the first University-sponsored studies in nursing using a research team approach at Lincoln Hospital School of Nursing. What made the survey unique was that it focused on both the nursing process and results of care in terms of patient comfort and safety. During WW1, Stewart Chaired the Vassar Training program for nurses. She later became a founder of the Winnipeg General Hospital Training School for Nurses alumnae program and a member of the legislative committee that helped establish the Manitoba Association of Graduate Nurses. Her main ambition was to train nursing school teachers. Stewart also Chaired the Education Committee of the International Council of Nurses. By 1944, she was elected vice-president of the American Council on Education. Two years later she received the Finland Medal for Humanitarian Work. In 1956, she was the recipient of an honorary degree of law from the University of Manitoba. Stewart died in October 1963. =Legacy= In 1978, Columbia University Teachers College created the Isabel Maitland Stewart Fund. They also started the annual Stewart Conference on Research in Nursing.

The location of the original painting is not known, but a different version, possibly a study, is displayed in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House. Watch meetings originated as nighttime religious services of the Methodist Church. The painting depicts a watch meeting or vigil in the dark interior of a wood cabin, with a group of enslaved black men, women and children are covertly gathered on December 31, 1862, around a pulpit made from U.S. Sanitary Commission crates. An older black man stands with a book and a large pocket watch with an anchor at the end of its chain, a symbol of hope. To his right sits a white woman holding a black baby. The man and woman may be intended to resemble Harriet Beecher Stowe and Uncle Tom. Several other women are sitting or kneeling in prayer, and one has prostrated herself. They are all waiting in expectation for the Emancipation Proclamation to be issued by the U.S. President Abraham Lincoln the following day, concerned to make sure that the President carries through with the preliminary proclamation that he published on September 22, 1862. To the left, in the doorway, a black person is holding the U.S. flag draped over their arms. Outside, an illuminated cross can be seen in the night sky. A banjo hangs on the wall. To the right of the painting, a slave in a neck collar stands holding a torch aloft before a copy of the proclamation pasted to the wall, which reads \\"Proclamation / 1st Jan. / For ever free / Slave\\". At the bottom, the title of the work is written out on the links of a metal chain. The abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison wrote in a letter to Lincoln on January 21, 1865 that it was \\"an admirable painting\\" which abolitionist donors in Boston had contributed \\"upwards of five hundred dollars\\" to give as a gift to Lincoln. The original version of the painting disappeared after Lincoln's death, possibly removed by his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. A different version, possibly a study, was found at an antiques shop in New York City in 1975, and it was presented to the White House by the Republican Party in 1976, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. It is displayed in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House. The painting was widely spread by copies on engraved copies on cartes de visite, in which the details are clearer than the known painted version held by the White House.

He worked on his own and with sons, sometimes known as Charles Duncan and Sons, building numerous stone houses and culverts around Davis County, Utah, and he contributed to the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. With son John Samuel Duncan, he built the John, Harriet, and Eliza Jennett Duncan House in Centerville, Utah around 1873. It is one of a number of his works listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Duncan helped build the Salt Lake Temple during the portion of its construction from 1863 to 1867. Duncan was born in 1823 in Dysart, Fifeshire, Scotland and in 1844 he married Margaret Bowman; they lived in Dysart where Charles was employed as a stone cutter and rock mason. The family came from Liverpool to New Orleans by the January to March 1852 voyage of the ship Kennebec; records show Duncans with first names Charles, Margaret, Isabell, Janet, another Margaret, were on board. \\"In 1852 the entire family sailed across the ocean on the Kennebec; arriving in the Salt Lake valley in September 1853. When the Duncans first arrived in Utah they lived with friends in Centerville for a brief time. Charles soon purchased land in Kaysville, and he moved the family there in the spring of 1854. Charles built a log cabin where his twin sons, John Samuel and Charles Jr., were born on May 22. The crops failed, and the family returned to Centerville in July. Word of Charles skill as a stonemason spread quickly; he was hired to build homes throughout the Centerville and Farmington area. Charles' career in masonry spanned from 1853 to 1891. Charles taught the trade to his three sons, John, Charles and Archibald. Most of the early rock buildings and culverts in South Davis County were built by the Duncans. Additionally, Charles worked for many years cutting stone for the Salt Lake City L.D.S. Temple which was constructed during 1863-67. A common, 'trademark' feature of the rock homes built by the Duncans is frequent use of quoins made from granite or sandstone. Charles brought back to Centerville pieces of stone which had been discarded or deemed unsuitable for the L.D.S. Temple. He used these stones to add decoration, as well as religious symbolism, to the residences in Centerville. Charles and his wife Margaret lived in the seven room stone house at 558 N. 340 E. with his son Archibald. Charles passed away in April 1891. John Samuel worked with his father, Charles Duncan, in building the Classical style stone house c. 1873. It reportedly was originally one large room with the adobe interior partitions added later. John bought the house from his father in 1888. According to the 1880 census records, John, age 26, lived with Harriet (Hattie) M., age 22, his wife, and Hattie M., age 2, and George W(alter) age 4/12, his two children, presumably in this house. In 1900 he was living with Eliza Jennett (Jennie), his second wife, and two children, Walter and Erma. Eliza Jennett was born in 1864 and died in August 1918. It appears that Harriet died prior to John's marriage to Eliza Jennett, however, it is unknown. In 1926 this house was sold to Harold Duncan, a son of John and Eliza Jennett born in 1904. Little is known about Harold. The house was then sold to John and Harriet's son, George Walter, in ....\\" Does it have Saltbox architecture, see :Category:Saltbox architecture in Utah Check Centerville MPS Works *Osmyn and Emily Deuel House, 271 South 200 East Centerville, UT (Duncan, Charles, and Sons), NRHP-listed *John, Harriet, and Eliza Jennett Duncan House (c.1873), 445 North 400 East Centerville, UT Duncan, Charles and John), NRHP-listed With *Harris--Tingey House, 269 E.

He was the owner of an iron foundry and machine factory in Frederiksberg and also established Frederiksberg Municipality's first waterworks. P. Andersen's Water Tower is listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. Career Svanholm Iron Foundry in 1869 In 1853, Andersen established an iron foundry on the Svanholm estate at Gammel Kongevej 62-64, between Vodroffsvej and Danmarksgade, in Frederiksberg. Svanholm Brewery was located on an adjacent site (No. 68(. In 1859, he was granted a five year monopoly on the casting of \\"hollow cylindrical objects\\" (\\"hule cylindriske legemer ved hj√¶lp af vertikale jernformkasser og kernestiver\\"). P. Andersen's waterworks and depot, 1878 Frederiksberg was incorporated as an independent municipality in 1857. In the early 1860s, a small working class neighbourhood known as the Sch√∏nberggade Quarter developed around his factory. The industrial activities and increasing density of the area resulted in a severe shortage of water. In 1868, after the magistrate in Copenhagen had rejected to supply the area with water, Andersen was given permission to establish his own waterworks on his property. It was completed in 1870 and he had by then als installed the necessary water pipes in the Sch√∏nbergs Quarter. On 16 Juni 1870, the Municipakl Council visited the complex. He later signed a contract with Frederiksberg Municipality for the installation of water pipes in Gammel Kongevej, All√©gade, Nyvej and Frederiksberg All√© as well as for the supply of water for watering the roads and for fire emergencies. His waterworks had a limited capacity of 4,000 barrels of water a day. In 1877, Frederiksberg Municipality therefore had to establish its first public waterworks. Andersen that same year constructed a new watertower at Lygtevej. Personal life and legacy P. Andersen's Watertower Andersen was married to Oline Louise Andersen (13 Februar 1810 ‚Äì 19 March 1874). They had two children, Carl Theodor Andersen and Vilhelmine Andersen. Peter Andersen died on 18 September 1887 and is buried at Frederiksberg Old Cemetery. Carl Theodor Andersen continued the company. The street Prinsesse Maries All√© was established on the western part of the property in 1905. In 919, Svanholm was the following year acquired by the wholesale company Bang & Pingel. The buildings were demolished in the 1950s to make way for the Codan Building. P, Andersen's Water Tower was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1991. It was designed by Vilhelm Tvede.

Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Anita Singh called the series \\"by far, the best soap opera on television.\\" The Los Angeles Timess Lorraine Ali praised the attention to historical detail and cast performances, particularly Colman and Bonham Carter. The Guardians Lucy Mangan praised the \\"top-notch performances\\" from the cast, adding that the season is \\"so confident and so precision-engineered that you don't notice the defects\\". Daniel Fienberg for The Hollywood Reporter judged the cast transition to be a success, adding the series \\"remains a model for carefully crafted episodic storytelling\\". Some criticism was leveled at the lack of nuance from the writing. The BBC's Hugh Montgomery found the writing \\"increasingly on the nose\\", though the season was \\"the best yet\\". Alison Rowat from The Herald opined some scenes were \\"over-engineered\\" and dialogue \\"too on the nose\\", but nevertheless the series excels as a political drama. Vultures Jen Chaney similarly found the writing \\"a bit heavy-handed\\" in nevertheless \\"an absorbing, thoroughly enriching experience\\". Reviewing for Variety, Caroline Framke thought the series does not always succeed in humanizing the royal family, but when it does, it is \\"as compelling a portrait of how power warps individuals, and the world along with them, as exists on TV.\\" Ed Power from The Independent was less complimentary, praising Colman's performance but finding the series somewhat \\"colourless\\".

In 1965, a five- year preliminary study of the Skin Tumor Test was presented at the New York Academy of Sciences. This work led to the development of the Makari Intradermal Cancer Test, which over the next decade was studied by researchers in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany, among others, and was approved for licensure in the UK in 1982 after testing. In 1988, he received a US patent on the test. Makari also pursued research into the possibility that viruses may be associated with cancer, such as the Marek's disease herpes virus in chickens.

He has served as Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention since 2017 and Dean of the Savaid Medical School of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2015. Gao is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and The World Academy of Sciences, as well as a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences and the US National Academy of Medicine. He was awarded the TWAS Prize in Medical Science in 2012 and the Nikkei Asia Prize in 2014. Early life and education Gao was born on 15 November 1961 in Ying County, Shanxi, China. He entered Shanxi Agricultural University and was assigned to study veterinary medicine even though he did not want to be a vet. After graduating in 1983, he entered the graduate school of Beijing Agricultural University, where he earned a master's degree in microbiology and veterinary epidemiology in 1986. This enabled him to change his career direction to infectious disease research, and he joined the faculty of the university as a teaching assistant and later lecturer in virology.  Education and career abroad  In 1991, Gao went to the United Kingdom to study at Oxford University, where he earned his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1994 under the supervision of David H. L. Bishop and Ernest A. Gould. After a three-month stint at the University of Calgary in Canada, he returned to Oxford as a postdoctoral researcher, working under John I. Bell, Andrew McMichael and Bent K. Jakobsen. In 1999, Gao moved to Harvard Medical School as a Wellcome Trust International Travelling Fellow and conducted research under Don Craig Wiley and Stephen C. Harrison until 2001. From 2001 to 2004, Gao taught at Oxford University, serving as a lecturer, doctoral supervisor, and group leader. Career in China After 13 years abroad, Gao returned to China in 2004 to serve as Professor and Director of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 2008 he was appointed Vice President of Beijing Institutes of Life Science and Director of the National Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microorganism and Immunology of the CAS.

Other activities * Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), Member of the Board of DirectorsBoard of Directors Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). * National Natural Science Foundation of China, Vice President  Contributions  Gao's main research focus is on the mechanism of viral entry and release, especially the cross-species transmission (host jump) of the influenza virus. He also studies viral ecology, including the ecology of the flu virus in migratory birds and poultry markets. He was the first to describe the cross-species transmission mechanism of the H5N1 avian flu virus. Gao's research also involves public and global health policy. During the peak of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, he spent two months leading the China Mobile Test Laboratory in Sierra Leone from September to November, playing a role that is described by the US National Academy of Sciences as \\"heroic\\" in fighting the epidemic. As of 2019, Gao has published 20 books or book chapters and over 500 peer-reviewed research papers, including those on newly discovered pathogenic viruses such as the SARS virus and the H7N9 avian flu virus.

Early life Ashley was the fourth son of John Ashley, a conductor and bassoonist who became the father of a notable family of musicians (General Charles Ashley, John James Ashley, and Charles Jane Ashley), and his wife, Mary (n√©e Jane). He was born on 8 September 1774, in the parish of St George Hanover Square, London, and baptised in the parish church on 10 September. At 9 years old, Ashley was already performing, participating in Westminster Abbey's 1784 Handel Commemoration and performing at the Pantheon in May and June of the same year. Career As of Joseph Doane's Musical Directory (1794), at age 20, Ashley was living at his father's house. At this time, he was employed as a drummer for the Royal Opera House's oratorios, where he worked alongside his family. The Royal Society of Musicians also made him one of the musicians to play at the annual St Paul's Cathedral benefit concert, an honour usually reserved for members of the Society. His father proposed him as a member the following year, a proposal which was ratified in 1796, certifying Ashley as a qualified organist, violinist, violist, and player of kettledrums. He continued to play at this concert from 1795 to 1805, gaining the right to send a deputy in his place in 1806. At several dates in the 1810s, he served on the Society's Court of Assistants. Ashley enjoyed what one Biographical Dictionary called \\"a long orchestral and solo concert career\\". From 1798, he performed in Ranelagh Gardens, under his father's influence. He also performed under his elder brother, John, at the Royal Opera House's oratorios. As of his father's death in 1805, Ashley was apparently in \\"a better situation than either of his brothers were placed in\\", according to the will. In 1817, he was part of the King's Theatre Band. According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"throughout his life he was in demand at major festivals\\"; it lists him as leading the violas at the Three Choirs festival in 1811, Oxford in 1813, York in 1823, and Chester in 1829. On 8 October 1800, Ashley became a freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians, and, on 7 July 1802, entered the Company's livery. Personal life At age 42, on 1 April 1816, Ashley married the \\"spinster\\", Elizabeth Palmer, at St George Hanover Square. He died on 11 October 1836 at his home of Park Place, Chelsea, having signed his will the previous day. His obituary was published in that year's volume of the Gentleman's Magazine. Elizabeth survived her husband, receiving a widow's allowance of ¬£2 12s 6d by 1837. Later that year, the Society donated ¬£5 for the treatment of Elizabeth's epilepsy, and Elizabeth was dead by 9 January 1839, when ¬£8 was spent on the funeral of \\"the widow of the late Richard Ashley\\".

The character is seen as a member of \\"The Losers Club\\" and a romantic interest of fellow members Bill Denbrough and Ben Hanscom. She is portrayed in the 1990 miniseries adaptation by Emily Perkins as a child and Annette O'Toole as an adult, and by Seema Shetty as an adult in the 1998 television series. She is again portrayed in the 2017 remake and its 2019 sequel by Sophia Lillis as a child and Jessica Chastain as an adult. Her father sexually abuses her and doesn't want her around boys.  Fictional character biography  Beverly Marsh was born on February 13, 1947 (novel); 1948 (miniseries) or 1976 (films). She is the daughter of Alvin and Elfrida Marsh. Her mother's presence in her life differs among the three continuities. In the novel, Elfrida is present, but she is mostly too preoccupied with her job to be much of a parent to Beverly; however, she does have concerns about Alvin abusing her daughter, and even asks Beverly at one time if her father has ever touched her. In the miniseries, she is never seen or mentioned. A flashback in IT: Chapter Two reveals that Elfrida died when Beverly was young; her death is implied to have been a suicide due to mental illness, possibly postpartum depression. Alvin blames Beverly for her mother's death, and abuses her physically and sexually throughout her childhood. Beverly is a classmate of Ben Hanscom, who harbors a secret crush on her. Ben writes her an anonymous love poem which states, \\"your hair is winter fire, January embers, my heart burns there too.\\" For most of the novel and adaptations, Beverly is led to believe that the poem was written by Bill Denbrough, who grows up to be a professional writer. Beverly eventually joins \\"The Losers Club\\" and befriends Eddie Kaspbrak, Richie Tozier, Mike Hanlon and Stanley Uris. Beverly has her first encounter with Pennywise the Dancing Clown in her bathroom when she hears voices coming from her sink chanting \\"We All Float Down Here\\". A balloon-like construct begins growing from her sink and bursts, covering her bathroom with blood. Beverly's screams attract the attention of her father, who cannot see the blood. She confides in The Losers Club, who can all see the blood and help her clean the bathroom. The Losers Club each approach Neibolt Street to destroy Pennywise once and for all. After the group finishes off the clown, they find themselves lost in the sewers and begin to panic. To seal their bond, the group has sex with each other in a controversial scene portrayed from Beverly's perspective. After they escape the sewers, the Losers make an oath that if Pennywise hasn't been defeated, they will all return to Derry to finish him. In her adulthood, due to the power of Pennywise and the town of Derry, Beverly forgets about The Losers Club and her childhood. She becomes a fashion designer and enters an abusive relationship with her husband, Tom Rogan. After she gets a call from Mike asking her to return to Derry, she stands up to Tom and finally leaves the relationship. She returns to Derry and reunites with The Losers Club. Beverly returns to her old home, now inhabited by an old woman named Mrs. Kersh, who informs her that her father has been deceased for five years. She apologises and begins to leave, only to be invited in by Mrs. Kersh for tea. However, Mrs. Kersh is revealed to be a form of Pennywise and Beverly escapes. She reunites with Ben, and shares a romantic encounter with him, but Ben realises that Beverly is another form of Pennywise. The Losers Club return to Neibolt Street to face Pennywise for the final time. Unfortunately, the confrontation results in Eddie's death, but the Losers are able to overcome and kill Pennywise. After the confrontation, Ben is finally able to confess his feelings for Beverly, and they begin a relationship.  Adaptations  Beverly is portrayed in the 1990 miniseries by Emily Perkins as a child and Annette O'Toole as an adult. This interpretation remains fairly faithful to the novel. Perkins' portrayal of Beverly was met with a relatively positive reception, but O'Toole's portrayal was met with a more negative one. Beverly is portrayed by Seema Shetty as an adult (named \\"Julie\\") in the 1998 television series. The portrayal of Beverly in the 2017 remake and its 2019 sequel by Sophia Lillis as a child and Jessica Chastain as an adult were much more positively received. This interpretation shows Beverly as being the moral compass of The Losers Club and playing a key role in defeating Pennywise in both films. During production of the 2017 film, actress Chlo√´ Grace Moretz was a frontrunner for the role of Beverly. However as the project remained in development hell, the actress eventually became too old to play the role of a child. Eventually, Moretz became attached to a different Stephen King adaptation in the role of Carrie White for the 2013 remake of Carrie.  Appearances in other King stories  Beverly appears in a brief cameo in King's novel 11/22/63. In the novel, she appears dancing with Richie Tozier preparing for a talent show a few months after fighting Pennywise. The two are approached by time-traveller Jake Epping, who enquires about the Dunning family. Afterwards he teaches the two how to dance properly. However, this meeting is erased by the end of the novel as Epping removes his mark on history.  Reception  The characterization of Beverly in King's novel has received acclaim from fans and critics, who view her as one of the best developed characters in the story. Beverly has also been viewed as being the most socially important character in the novel due to the themes explored with her character such as trauma, abuse, sexual identity and bravery. The portrayals of Beverly by Lillis, Perkins and Chastain were all critically acclaimed by fans. Lillis was nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of the character, including a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, a MTV Movie & TV Award for Best Scared-As-Shit Performance, and a Teen Choice Award for Breakout Movie Star. Lillis was also nominated for Breakthrough Artist by the San Diego Film Critics Society and for Best Youth Performance by Seattle Film Critics Society and by the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association. The portrayal of adult Beverly by Annette O'Toole in the 1990 miniseries received more negative reception.  Analysis  = Controversy = The scene in the novel where Beverly has a sexual encounter with the rest of the members of The Losers Club in the sewers of Derry after defeating Pennywise for the first time has become one of the more controversial decisions from the novel. The scene has been viewed by many fans as extremely uncomfortable and in poor taste, as the characters were still only children. The scene was omitted from Andy Muschietti's film series as well as the 1990 miniseries. The scene was reportedly meant to take place in Cary Joji Fukunaga's original screenplay, but was removed once Muschietti became involved. O'Toole has admitted to disliking the removal of the Losers' orgy scene in the miniseries: \\"This was their greatest attachment to one another ‚Äì she thought they were all going to die, and this was a gift she was giving to each one of them, and I thought it was the most beautiful, generous love-filled gift, and it tied them all together in such an amazing way.\\" = Depiction of abuse victims = Throughout the novel, Beverly is consistently abused by the men in her life. As a child, she is physically and sexually abused by her father Alvin. As an adult, due to the repressed memories of Derry, she marries Tom Rogan, who is physically and emotionally abusive towards her. The abuse Beverly faced at the hands of her father has been described as one of the more disturbing elements of the novel due to the realistic undertones. Beverly has also been seen as a positive example of overcoming trauma and abuse. = Loss of innocence = As with Bill Denbrough, Beverly reflects the novel's themes of maturity and loss of innocence. While this is most blatantly noticeable in the controversial sexual encounters in the sewers, Beverly also faces maturity in different ways throughout the novel. Beverly is struggling with her budding womanhood, and is beginning to deal with different problems. This is more explicitly shown in the 2017 film adaptation, where Beverly attempts to purchase tampons from the local pharmacy. In this scene, Beverly first encounters Bill, Eddie and Stan. Beverly comes across the boys in an attempt to avoid Greta Bowie (re-named Greta Keene in this adaptation), to avoid further humiliation from her, as Keene had earlier dumped a bag of trash on Beverly and \\"slut-shamed\\" her. Beverly attempts to hide the products from the boys to save her from embarrassment, and later attempts to hide them from her abusive father, to no avail. After being asked by her father if she's \\"still his little girl\\", heavily implying a past of sexual abuse by her father, Beverly cuts her hair in her bathroom in an act of defiance. Beverly has to face more of the ideas of maturity than the other members of The Losers Club due to the abuse she faces at home, and the rumors of promiscuity that follow her at school. Beverly has to find her own way of maturing into womanhood, which has helped the character to stand out for many readers.

During her career, she saw service shipping passengers and supplies to the mining settlements along the south shores of the lake and often returning with copper ore or was commissioned to carry other goods. Her eight-year career on Lake Superior ended when her boilers exploded, killing several aboard, and ultimately sending the steamboat to the bottom in pieces. Description The Independence was a wooden hull, steam driven steamboat whose propulsion was effected by means of two rotary steam engines, two screw (Ericson's) propellers, and schooner rigged sails to assist her engines when the winds were effective enough. A single decked vessel, she had a keel of with a beam, and had a 9 ¬Ω feet hold, and a cargo capacity of 261 tons. In calm weather should could maintain a speed of 4 mph. In 1844 the Independence had her engines modified to burn coal to improve her speed, and her propellers were altered. In 1852 she was outfitted with a new engine and boilers.Mansfield, 1899, Vol I, p. 404.Northeast Michigan Oral History and Historic Photograph Archive In 1856, the value of the Independence was assessed at $12,000.Maritime History of the Great Lakes Newspaper account: Buffalo Daily Courier, Saturday, December 11, 1856 History Lake Superior and Northern Michigan Map published 1879 by Rand McNally Unlike the first steamboat navigation to appear on the lower Great Lakes beginning in 1816, steamboat navigation did not occur on Lake Superior until 1845, prompted by the abundant copper and iron ore deposits which were discovered along its shores a few years before when the region overall was still a wilderness. The mile long turbulent rapids of Saint's Mary's River, connecting Lake Huron with Lake Superior, had always prevented vessels on the lower Great Lakes from venturing up and into Lake Superior.Bowen, 1953, p. 9 In 1842, Captain James Averell, a shipbuilder from Maine, established a shipyard on Chicago's North Side, just below the Rush- street bridge, on Lake Michigan. There he commenced construction of the Independence, and by July, 1843 the Independence was ready for running on the lakes. It was the first propeller driven vessel built on Lake Michigan, and the third to run on the lake.Mansfield, 1899, Vol I, p. 404Andreas, 1884, Vol I, p. 242 In the fall of that year the Independence, commanded by Captain Averill, cruised up Lake Michigan where it arrived at Saint Mary's River at Sault Ste. Marie. Preparations were made to haul the vessel on rollers over the portage running between Lake Huron and Lake Superior, around the rapids and falls at Sault Ste. Marie in the same manner as several other sailing vessels before her. Late in October, 1845, after being outfitted for a trip across Lake Superior, the Independence was launched into St. Mary's River above the rapids where she entered Lake Superior, becoming the first steamboat to run on that lake. Her cargo included a large number of kegs filled with blasting powder and supplies for the mining settlements on the Keweenaw Peninsula.Bowen, 1953, p. 10Courter, 2005, pp. 35‚Äì36 The peninsula was discovered to have the largest quantities of pure copper in the world, greatly prompting lake navigation, mining on its shores and commerce.Ralph, 1890, p. 21 At that time there were few vessels of any kind on Lake Superior, as the Sault Ste. Marie Ship Canal had not been constructed. The Independence cast her anchor above the rapids in May, 1846. At an average speed of 5 mph, the Independence ran on the lake successfully.Mansfield, 1899, Vol I, p. 407Labadie, Agranat and Anfinson, Essay After the arrival of the Independence the Napoleon came along and were the only two steam vessels on that lake. Both were hauled over the portage alongside and around the rapids of the Saint Mary's river to get to the upper river and to Lake Superior.Andreas, 1884, Vol II, p. 81 The Independence spent much of her career bringing miners and supplies to the various copper mines on the soth shore of Lake Superior, while often shipping copper ore across the lake. Arriving from Detroit, on June 11, 1848 the famous newspaper editor Horace Greeley boarded the Independence and cruised to the Keweenaw Peninsula at Eagle Harbor where he had invested in copper mining. From the deck of the Independence, not believing that Lake Superior was too cold to swim in, Greeley leaped from her deck into the lake.Lankton, 1993, pp. 4‚Äì5, 11 Shortly before reaching the north point of the peninsula the steamer encountered gale force head winds, forcing her to take cover by the shore of the jutting peninsula. After dropping anchor Captain Averell waited 28 hours for the winds to subside. By the time they were able to resume their journey, the smoke stack became almost completely clogged from the rain-soaked soot, forcing the craft to move at slow pace the rest of the way to Eagle Harbor.Courter, 2005, p. 73 On November 21, 1853 Independences career was abruptly ended when her boiler exploded on the lake near Sault Ste. Marie. Captain John McKay, left the dock at the Superior-Huron Portage around 12 o'clock, with approximately three dozen passengers, and a heavy freight of winter supplies for Ontonagon and La Point. Departing from Sault Ste. Marie, Independence had proceeded less than a mile, when her boiler burst, reducing a large section of the craft to splinters, killing the first engineer, one passenger, and two firemen. The explosion of the boiler also scalded and injured the second engineer and several passengers. A portion of the vessel remained afloat where the survivors had gathered on the deck. As the wrecked vessel started drifting towards the river, two keel boats finally made it to the wreck and rescued its survivors, saving them from the rocks along the mile long turbulent rapids of Saint Mary's River not far ahead. .Maritime History of the Great Lakes Newspaper accounts: Buffalo Daily Republic, Saturday, November 26, 1853; Forest City Democrat, Saturday, December 3, 1853 Another crash of the Independence took place as the vessel settled.

In June 1858, the Emperor Alexander 2 rode along the old Arkhangelsk tract. There is information about the impressions of Alexander 2 of the area he saw. ‚ÄúOn the way to the next Nikiforovskaya station, before reaching the Shelota Volost government, there is a large mountain, from which a long and sloping descent into the valley begins. The Emperor ordered to stop and, getting up in the carriage, admired the picturesque view. From here, a wide outlook opened up with settlements and villages scattered here and there, whitewashed churches with their high bell towers and spitz shining brightly in the rays of the morning sun, the Vaga River meandering in a bright, silvery ribbon, forests, fields and arable land.\\" The view that opened up to His Majesty on the way along the Vaga River impressed the Sovereign Emperor so much that he then drove to the village of Smetaninskaya with an open top of the carriage. Currently Shelota is a central rural settlement as part of Verkhovazhsky District of Vologda Oblast. An expedition was held at the territory of Shelota for filming of the \\"Sashka\\" movie. It is the story of a 12-year-old boy Sasha, who dreams of getting on the inside of a local gang of hooligans. Since 2017, with the support of non- profit organizations, the \\"Shelota - Point of Attraction\\" project has been organized in which the Shelotyans and people who are interested in rural life hold cultural and social events. Such events include: 1\\\\. International Ceramic Festival in Shelota The founder of this festival is Stepanova Svetlana Anatolyevna. The event is international; guests from various Russian cities and countries such as Germany, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon attended. 2\\\\. Restoration of the Trinity Church and Trinity Festivities In 2017, 5 bells were cast for the future bell tower with private donations. And in 2020, master Georgy Fedyaevsky restored the stained glass window on the main facade of the building. 3\\\\. Various concerts and lectures 4\\\\. Cultural tourism 5\\\\.

The following traditional and artistic crafts are presented in Shelota: Ceramic craft (Shelota is famous for its International Ceramic Festival, which attracts ceramists and guests from different cities and countries.

Sights  = Church of the Holy Trinity = Built in 1789. The church is located in the settlement of Makarovskoe in Shelota on a hill, which gives a magical view of the village.  Church decoration  On the first floor, there are three thrones: Flora and Laurus, the prophet of God Elijah and St. Nicholas the Wonder-worker. On the second floor, there are two thrones: the Life-Giving Trinity and in the name of the Nativity of the Most Holy Theotokos.  Church history  The church was built in the style of the Totma Baroque, which makes it possible to assume that it was built by craftsmen from Totma. Since 1801, services have been conducted at the church all year round. The first floor of the church was heated, which made it possible to conduct services even in severe frosts. During the Soviet Union times, the bell tower was destroyed to the ground. Today, all that remains of it is trash as a memory. Now the liturgy is held in the summer. The church is under reconstruction. In 2017, the bells for the future bell tower were cast. Bells were cast to order in Tutaev. And in 2020, a stained glass window was installed on the main facade made by the master Georgy Fedyaevsky.  Church today  Trinity festivities are held annually in Shelota. Over the past 10 years, on one Sunday, the Shelotyans have been organizing festivities which are attended by people from all over the country. The festivities begin immediately after Matins. Religious procession around the church and under the song the crowd then descends from the temple to the field. Games, traditional costumes, dances and singing, folk instruments, an atmosphere of celebration and reunification with roots - this is what the Trinity festivities are all about. Festivities are held with donations from sponsors and residents. = Museum of local history = The local history museum is located in a wooden building near the Anyutin Square, which belongs to the Shelota school. Inside there is an exposition of village life, as well as objects of the Soviet Union times, the history of the Shelota School, a collection of stones found in the vicinity, etc. The route \\"One day in the village\\" has been elaborated, which includes a visit to the church, a walk in the village, a visit to the monument to the writer Vladimir Tendryakov, tea drinking at Koticheva Hill, rest on the grass, swimming in the Vaga river and a master class on making ritual dolls. = Monument to Tendryakov = Vladimir Fedorovich Tendryakov is a Russian Soviet writer, author of acutely conflict stories about the spiritual and moral problems of contemporary life, acute problems of Soviet society, about life in the countryside. = \\"Train kiln\\" Vaga = In August 2020, in the village of Makarovskaya, the first \\"train kiln\\"‚Äìtype wood-fired ceramic kiln appeared in Russia. A team of ceramists under the leadership of the Vologda master Vladimir Kholshchagin built the kiln in 5 days, the stove was named \\"Vaga\\". The peculiarity is that the kiln has two burners. They start to heat from the bottom. Then, when the temperature rises, they heat from above. By that time, a coal ash bed has formed in the lower burner. Air passes through it and is heated, and ash, settling on the walls of the ceramics, gives the effect of ash glaze. The ceramics in such a kiln is very strong, and the visual effects are unpredictable. The project was conducted by the non-profit organization \\"Center for Cultural Projects Festival\\" with support of the Presidential Grants Fund.  Ceramic Festival  2017 The Ceramics Festival in Shelota became international in its first year: then ceramists Heida Nonnenmacher and Peter Wichmann , as well as a metal artist Martial Herbst came to the Russian North from Germany. Ceramists Alexander Gladky, Tatyana Vereshchagina and Svetlana Zhuchenko, as well as artists David Plaksin and Zoya Malyarenko, came to Shelota from the northern capital. Tatiana Gorbatova, master of the Somov school of ceramics, arrived from Verkhovazhye. During the 7 days of the festival, the participants painted a variety of pottery, built a kiln for coal burning of ceramics, held master classes on three types of burning, including coal, paper and raku, and also exchanged experiences in organizing art exhibitions and charitable events. Local craftsmen taught guests to weave salt shakers from birch bark and make a traditional amulet doll. In addition, the guests of the festival visited the Alekseevskaya Fair in Verkhovazhye, watched a performance at the Orthodox Art Theater, tasted pies from the Russian stove and took part in folk festivities. 2018 The second Ceramic Festival was held together with the non-profit organization Center for Cultural Programs ‚ÄúCulture and Peace‚Äù. This time, guests from Syria, Lebanon and Yemen came to Shelota to get acquainted with the Vologda outback and tell about the culture of their countries. Ceramists from St. Petersburg, the Arkhangelsk Oblast and Verkhovazhye, as well as wood master Oleg Arseniev and the folklore ensemble \\"Radonitsa\\" from the neighboring village of Lipki were invited to the festival. During the festival, the participants made a sculpture for fire burning ‚ÄúShelotyanka‚Äù, the image of which was inspired by traditional northern motives, held a raku firing and a master class on making products on a potter's wheel, and also listened to a lecture by Ikhlas Alfakih, an artist and lecturer of sculpture at Damascus University about modern technologies of modeling from polymer materials. One of the days of the festival was dedicated to Arab culture: the quests tried tabbouleh, kabsu and coffee from a copper coffee pot, wrote their names in Arabic script and learned to dance the Syrian national dance. Then it was the turn for local residents to tell the Arab guests about their native culture. The program of the ‚ÄúRussian Day‚Äù included valiant amusements, ditties, round dances and a lunch with dishes of traditional Russian cuisine. 2019 The third international ceramic festival was dedicated to the 90th anniversary of the Verkhovazhsky District and the 75th anniversary of Tatyana Vasilyevna Gorbatova, the keeper of the Somov craft. The festival was attended by ceramists from St. Petersburg, as well as guests from Moscow and Verkhovazhye. A special guest of the festival was Emily Slide, an international communications specialist from the United States, who lives most of her life in Germany and is fond of Russian culture. The participants of the festival got acquainted with the technology of lace production, traditional wooden architecture and the life of the Russian North, visiting museums in Vologda, Semenkovo and Verkhovazhye. During the six days of the festival, everyone saw how to set up a loom, learned how to weave from birch bark and sculpt Somov whistles from clay. The heart of the festival was the fire sculpture ‚ÄúSinging Tree‚Äù, which the participants created jointly based on the traditional Somov toy. They sculpted it from a special clay with the addition of chamotte: small particles of already burnt clay, which give the clay its reinforcing properties. On the final day of the festival, after three days of air drying and seven hours of drying with a gas burner, the ceramic sculpture was burned. This spectacle became even more impressive due to the fact that the sculpture exploded and ‚Äúthe birds flew from the singing tree‚Äù. Perhaps because the 60-kilogram sculpture was not dry enough due to weather conditions. the festival participants and local residents celebrated the experience gained with champagne and homemade panna cotta with wild berries.

With Cox later served as the bishop of Bountiful, Utah, and he settled in Sanpete County in 1849.

Georgie is the younger brother of Bill Denbrough, who falls prey to Pennywise the Dancing Clown. He is used by Pennywise to taunt Bill throughout the novel. Georgie is portrayed by Tony Dakota in the 1990 miniseries adaptation and by Jackson Robert Scott in the 2017 re- adaptation and reprises his role in the 2019 sequel. Dakota also reprised his role for a short film titled Georgie which shows a \\"What If\\" scenario if Georgie had survived his encounter with Pennywise. Fictional character biography George Elmer \\"Georgie\\" Denbrough was born September 18, 1951 (1953 in the miniseries and 1981 in the film adaptation) to Zach and Sharon Denbrough, and is the younger brother of Bill Denbrough. Georgie has a very positive relationship with his brother, considering him to be his best friend. =Encounter with Pennywise= On one October night in 1957, (1960 in the miniseries and 1988 in the film series), Georgie makes a paper boat with his brother on a rainy day. Bill is too sick to accompany Georgie outside, so he helps him make the boat and sends him on his way. The boat ends up falling down a storm drain, much to Georgie's dismay. Georgie then encounters Pennywise the Dancing Clown in the storm drain, who offers him a balloon, and tells him about how \\"we all float down here\\" (\\"down here\\" meaning the sewers.) The Clown offers Georgie his boat back, but when Georgie attempts to reach out to it, Pennywise grabs Georgie's arm and bites it off, leaving Georgie to bleed to death in the rain as Pennywise chants \\"You'll float too\\". =Being used by Pennywise= Not long after his death, Georgie's ghost would be utilised by Pennywise to taunt Bill. Constantly using Georgie as a way of getting to Bill emotionally. This is best exemplified in the 2017 film adaptation. Georgie appears to Bill several times throughout the movie and the sequel. Adaptations =1990 miniseries= Georgie was portrayed by Tony Dakota in the 1990 miniseries adaptation. This iteration remains faithful to the source material, however, Georgie is killed by Pennywise off-screen, due to being a television miniseries, graphic scenes such as the death of young Georgie wouldn't have been allowed to have been shown on television. =Film series= Georgie was portrayed by Jackson Robert Scott in the 2017 re- adaptation of King's novel as well as its 2019 sequel. This adaptation of the character features the onscreen demise of Georgie, as well as showing more of Pennywise using Georgie to affect Bill psychologically. Behind the scenes of the film, the young actor stated that he was not afraid of Bill Skarsg√•rd as Pennywise, and in fact formed a bond with the actor. Scott's performance as Georgie was acclaimed by fans and critics. Death and controversy The violent nature of Georgie's death in It received a polarising response from some critics. While most felt that the graphic nature of Georgie's death was necessary to show the danger of Pennywise, some viewers felt that Pennywise ripping a poor innocent child's arm off and watching Georgie desperately attempt to crawl away was seen by some as being \\"downright disturbing\\" and \\"too graphic\\". =Short film= Georgie is the main character of a 2019 short film titled Georgie directed by Ryan Grulich with Tony Dakota reprising his role. This short film shows an undead adult Georgie resurrected via drawing. This is the only adaptation to show Georgie as an adult. Analysis Throughout the novel and films, Pennywise uses the \\"ghost of Georgie\\" to play on Bill's survivor's guilt. This is further explored in It Chapter Two, where Bill blames himself for Georgie's death, exemplified in a scene in which the adult Bill returns to the storm drain where Georgie was murdered. The scene progresses into a flashback where Pennywise's disembodied voice taunts Bill for not being present with Georgie when he died. The adult Bill struggles with posttraumatic stress disorder due to Georgie's death, and attempts to prevent Pennywise from killing another young boy, to no avail. Georgie has also been seen as an interpretation of the way children are lured by predators, notably seen in Georgie's encounter with Pennywise at the storm drain. In popular culture The character of Georgie has become an iconic figure in the horror genre. The character's distinctive yellow raincoat with the paper boat the \\"S.S. Georgie\\" have become staples of the horror franchise. Georgie's icon status is unique considering the character is not a horror film villain such as Pennywise, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers. The character has also been referenced many times in different forms of media. The character is mentioned numerous times by metalcore band Ice Nine Kills in their song \\"IT Is The End\\", which is based on the 2017 film adaptation of the novel. The song is from the album The Silver Scream, in which each song on the album is based on a different horror film. The scene where Georgie meets Pennywise in the 1990 miniseries has become an internet meme depicting Pennywise attempting to coerce Georgie to come down to the sewers with different things. Georgie was also referenced in King's novel 11/22/63.

It was also the second strongest tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in North Indian Ocean history. The seventh depression, fifth named cyclone, and the first, and only super cyclonic storm of the annual season, Kyarr developed from a low-pressure system near the Equator. The system organized itself and intensified to a tropical storm on October 24 as it moved eastwards. The storm underwent rapid intensification and reached super cyclonic storm status on October 27, as it turned westwards. Despite the immense strength of the storm, and many countries being affected by high tides and storm surges, there were no reported fatalities.  Meteorological history  A low pressure area formed on October 17 in the Arabian Sea west of India near the Lakshadweep islands. Around that time, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) anticipated that the low would eventually develop into a tropical cyclone. The low remained in the same general region for a few days, becoming well-marked by October 22\\\\. The IMD classified the system as a depression early on October 24, upgrading it to a deep depression by later that day. On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing warnings on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 04A. The deep depression initially moved to the northeast toward the west coast of India. Early on October 25, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm, naming it Kyarr. Later that day, the storm turned northward and intensified further to a severe cyclonic storm. Warm water temperatures of around , as well as low wind shear, fueled rapid intensification. Kyarr turned to the northwest away from India on October 26\\\\. On the same day, the IMD upgraded the storm to a very severe cyclonic storm and later to an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Early on October 27, the IMD upgraded Kyarr further to a super cyclonic storm, the first one in the basin since Gonu in 2007; it was also the only recorded super cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea to occur after the monsoon season. Both the IMD and the JTWC estimated peak maximum sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), with a minimum central pressure of estimated by the IMD. Operationally, the JTWC estimated slightly higher winds of 250 km/h (155 mph). At its peak, Kyarr had a well- defined eye, surrounded by well-defined rainbands and outflow. For about 12 hours, Kyarr maintained peak intensity, although it remained a super cyclonic storm for about 51 hours while moving toward the Arabian Peninsula. On October 30, the storm began weakening as the track shifted to the west, falling to the intensity of a severe cyclonic storm. On the same day, Kyarr co-existed with Cyclonic Storm Maha, marking the first time on record that there were two simultaneous cyclonic storms in the Arabian Sea. Kyarr turned to the southwest, paralleling the coastline of the Arabian Peninsula offshore. On October 31, it weakened to a deep depression, and Kyarr deteriorated further to a depression on the next day. The circulation passed just north of Socotra on November 2, and shortly thereafter weakened into a remnant low off the northern coast of Somalia.  Preparations and impact  Due to the large circulation of the cyclone, the IMD recommended all fishermen avoid sailing in the Arabian Sea for five days. The Indian Coast Guard rescued at least 19 fishermen caught by the storm. The Indian Navy rescued 17 fishermen from a boat that sank amid high seas west of Mumbai. On October 24, Kyarr washed ashore the chemical tanker Nu-Shi Nalini near Dona Paula in Goa state, which was carrying naphtha, an explosive. The material was salvaged about a month after the storm, and was eventually shipped in early January 2020. Also offshore, the cyclone forced two AIDA cruise ships to reroute their paths. In advance of the tropical cyclone, the IMD issued rain and surf alerts for the Indian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa. As Kyarr approached western India, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall onshore, peaking at in Malvan, Maharashtra. In Goa, the rains caused flash flooding, while strong winds felled trees and power lines. In Mumbai, the storm's heavy rains contributed to a dengue outbreak, with a 70% increase in cases of the mosquito-borne disease in December 2019 compared to the same month in 2018. In Gujarat, more than 157,000 farmers filed insurance claims due to damage related to Kyarr, with most of the losses related to groundnut and cotton. The state government reimbursed farmers for their losses.https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/rajkot/vijay-rupani-will- compensate-farmers-for-crop-loss-6108683/ In southern Pakistan, officials closed beaches and opened four shelters due to high tides from the cyclone. Floods affected parts of Karachi, closing a section of Defence Raya Golf and Country Club. High tides from Kyarr flooded towns on the coast of Oman. In neighboring United Arab Emirates, high tides flooded streets, houses, and schools in eastern coastal areas of Sharjah and Fujairah. Heavy rainfall from the outskirts of Kyarr also caused flooding in Dubai. Kyarr started to slow down as it moved through the Arabian Sea, and it dissipated before reaching Socotra Island.

Powell is an off-duty police officer who gets called into work to investigate a potential hostage situation at Nakatomi Plaza. Powell then becomes a central character in the conflict, and a source of moral support for protagonist John McClane. Fictional character biography =Investigation of Nakatomi Plaza= The audience is introduced to Powell while he is on his way home from work. Powell made a stop at a nearby service station to grab Twinkies for his pregnant wife. While at the station, Powell was radioed in from his work to investigate an apparent emergency at Nakatomi Plaza. Powell investigated the lobby of the building and was led to believe that the alarm was tripped due to a bug in the building's computer system. As Powell re-entered his car and began to radio that there was no emergency at Nakatomi Plaza, John McClane threw the body of one the terrorists he had killed onto the roof of Powell's car. After the body landed, the remaining terrorists began opening fire at the car, riddling it with bullets and causing it to crash nearby. Powell called in for assistance from his supervisor, Deputy Chief Dwayne T. Robinson. Powell eventually came into contact with McClane over the radios, knowing him only as \\"Roy\\". Powell would inform McClane of the LAPD's strategies and would provide encouragement and comfort for McClane during the siege. Powell eventually reveals to McClane that he was given a desk job after he accidentally shot and killed a child holding a toy gun. Powell became unable to cope with the incident and refused to fire his weapon again. McClane is eventually able to save his wife Holly from the clutches of the German terrorist, Hans Gruber, ending the event. Outside the building, McClane and Powell finally meet for the first time face- to-face. The encounter is briefly interrupted by Gruber's henchmen Karl Vreski ‚Äì who was believed dead ‚Äì emerging from the building with a machine gun still swearing vengeance on McClane for the death of his brother Tony. Vreski is shot dead by Powell once Vreski aims his weapon at McClane, ending the reign of the terrorists and restoring Powell's courage after his incident. Powell opens the door to Argyle's limousine for McClane and Holly to drive off together. =Post-Nakatomi= At some point in between the events of Die Hard and Die Hard 2, McClane moved from New York to Los Angeles with Holly, and he and Powell became co-workers and close friends. During the events of the film, McClane had gone to Washington D.C. to celebrate Christmas with his in-laws, and was waiting at Washington Dulles International Airport for Holly's flight from Los Angeles to arrive. While waiting, McClane came across a pair of armed criminals breaking into the baggage handling area. McClane was forced to kill one of the suspects in self-defense. Due to the unprofessionalism of the airport's police chief, Carmine Lorenzo, McClane was forced to grab an improvised set of fingerprints from the deceased suspect and fax them to Powell in Los Angeles for identification. Powell identifies the suspect as Sergeant Oswald Cochran, who was believed killed in action in a helicopter accident in Honduras two years prior. Powell faxes the dossier to McClane in Dulles and the two say their goodbyes. Production The character of Powell in the film was the breakout performance for actor Reginald VelJohnson, who had previously only had small roles in films such as Ghostbusters and Crocodile Dundee. The role helped VelJohnson to gain the role of Carl Winslow on the television sitcom Family Matters, where he would again be portraying a police officer. Despite only appearing in two scenes during Die Hard 2, VelJohnson still received fourth billing, behind other returning actors Bonnie Bedelia and William Atherton from the first film. Before VelJohnson was cast, actor Wesley Snipes had auditioned for the part. Gene Hackman had also been considered for the part according to VelJohnson, but was unable to take the role.. 22 Aug 1988. =Potential return= It has been speculated that Powell will return in the upcoming sixth film in the franchise, currently being called McClane. It has been rumoured that VelJohnson will reprise his role in the film, and will appear alongside Bruce Willis as McClane, and potentially Samuel L. Jackson reprising his role as Zeus Carver from Die Hard With a Vengeance. However, the project has currently been cancelled outright due to Disney‚Äôs acquisition of Fox, and is now planned to be rebooted as a potential streaming service show. Reception VelJohnson's portrayal of Powell in the first Die Hard was met with much acclaim from fans. Powell has gone on to become one of the most recognisable characters from the franchise, along with John McClane and Hans Gruber. The dynamic between VelJohnson and Bruce Willis in the film was another source for cricital acclaim, with many critics citing Powell as the moral center of the film, and with many considering him to be something of McClane's sidekick. Powell's character arc and development throughout the first film was also seen by many as a highlight of the film, signifying living with a mistake and grief. Powell eventually overcoming his guilt to save McClane and Holly at the end of the film from Karl Vreski was seen as a perfect ending to the character's arc. Legacy Due to the popularity of his role in Die Hard, VelJohnson gained the role of Carl Winslow on the television sitcom Family Matters. VelJohnson would also appear in television show Chuck reprising his role as Powell in the episode Chuck Versus Santa Claus. VelJohnson would also appear as himself in the television show Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which often references and pays tribute to Die Hard as it is main character Jake Peralta's favourite film. VelJohnson appears in the episode Bachelor/ette Party in the show's fifth season during Jake Peralta's bachelor party. VelJohnson is intended to be a part of a scavenger hunt set up by Peralta's best friend, Charles Boyle. However Peralta and the other attendees, Terry Jeffords and Captain Raymond Holt, ditch the scavenger hunt. Eventually Boyle finds out about the deception and leaves upset. This leads the group to VelJohnson's apartment where Peralta attempts to apologise to him, where VelJohnson retorts at Peralta and states that he has made an enemy for life, and intends to tell Peralta's idol and VelJohnson's Die Hard co-star Bruce Willis that he sucks. Powell remains one of VelJohnson's favourite and most iconic roles, alongside Carl Winslow from Family Matters. Due to the character's apparent fascination with Twinkies, VelJohnson has commented that many fans give him Twinkies when they meet him. The character's lack of involvement in Die Hard 2 gained a lackluster response from fans of the character, who had wished to have seen the character in more than two scenes. The character's later absence from the franchise's future instalments has granted a degree of backlash from fans, who have wished to see the character return in some capacity. Movie critic Chris Stuckmann stated in his review of the film, \\"I wish there was more Powell in it too, I want more Reginald VelJohnson. I understand that [McClane] is at an airport in a different place.\\" References Category:Die Hard Category:Fictional police officers Category:Film characters introduced in 1979 Category:Action film characters Category:Fictional police sergeants Category:Fictional characters from California Category:Film sidekicks Category:Fictional African-American people ","title":"Al Powell"},{"id":"62172829","text":"Hubert Kusz (21 September 1928 ‚Äì 4 August 2017) was a Polish footballer who played as a defender.

Life  Miron Barnovschi comes from a family of Moldovan boyars of Polish origin (Barnowski). His father Dimitrie had held high office in the Moldavian court where he was \\"Mare Postelnic\\" (\\"Grand Chamberlain\\") from 1599 to 1606. His grandfather Thomas Barnovschi had been one of the leaders of the conspiracy of the boyars who had ended to the reign of John the Despot in 1563. By his mother, the family of Moldovan boyars MovilƒÉ, was also the grand-nephew of the princes Ieremia MovilƒÉ and Simion I MovilƒÉ. He also assumes high office with the princes of Moldavia: he is \\"SpƒÉtar\\" (\\"Constable\\") from 1615 to 1618, \\"P√¢rcƒÉlab\\" (\\"Ch√¢telain\\") of Hotin from 1618 to 1622 and \\"Hetman\\" (\\"Military Governor\\" \\") from Suceava from 1622 to 1626. At the end of his reign, his father-in-law Radu Mihnea, weakened by the disease, gives him an important role in the management of the country. It is for this reason that at the death of the prince on January 13, 1626, the boyars elect him as prince and that his appointment is confirmed by the \\"Sublime Porte\\". According to the genealogy \\"Europaische Stammtafeln\\", Miron Barnovschi married a daughter of Prince Radu Mihnea2. In his book on the reign Miron Barnovschi, Aurel Golima≈ü presents another version of the facts: in 1614, Barnovschi married a commoner, Elena Vartic (died in 1622). Towards the end of Radu Mihnea's reign, Miron Barnovschi promised to marry Mihnea's daughter, Ecaterina. However, he did not respect his commitment, which Princess Ecaterina would never have forgiven him. In 1626 he would have contracted a union with a Polish princess3. On the religious level, his reign in Moldova is characterized by his attention to the construction of religious monuments. He built the Barnovschi Monastery in his family fiefdom and also fortified the Dragomirna Monastery which had been built in 1609 under the auspices of Atanasie Crimca, Metropolitan of Moldova from 1608 to 1629. He was also responsible for the construction of the Church of St. John of Jassy. On the secular level, however, Miron Barnovschi MovilƒÉ left a bad memory in the Moldavian peasantry, because it is he who introduced serfdom by his decree of January 16, 1628, which fixes the peasants to the land of their lord in their forbidding to move freely4. The following year, he refused to accept the increase in tribute that the Grand Vizier wanted to impose on Moldova. In August 1629, he had to give up his throne to his young brother-in-law Alexander the \\"little gentleman\\", son of Radu Mihnea. He then retired to Poland, which does not fail to awaken the suspicion of the Ottomans. In April 1633, after Prince Alexandru Ilia≈ü was driven out by a rebellion of the boyars, the latter again appointed him as a prince. Miron then decides to go personally to Constantinople to obtain the confirmation of his election. It takes nearly two months to reach the capital of the Ottoman Empire because he stops in Bucharest where he meets Prince Matei Basarab which reinforces the distrust of the Ottomans against him. When he finally arrives in Constantinople at the end of June, the intrigues led by his opponents, notably the future prince Basile le Loup, did their job: the Ottoman government refuses to recognize him and condemns him to death. Miron Barnovschi-MovilƒÉ is beheaded on July 2, 1633 for the Divan under the Sultan's eyes. His body is left in the yard until evening. The Grand Vizier then released the \\"Postelnic\\" Iancu Costin (father of the historian Miron Costin) who had been arrested with him, so that he had the remains removed and transported to the Orthodox Patriarchate. From there, Prince Basil the Wolf will later transfer his remains to Moldova. His cousin Musa MovilƒÉ, who had married Radu Mihnea's daughter Ecatarina, is named to succeed him.

It is located in the commune of La Hague, bordering on the La Hague site. The CSM was created in 1969 and then received nuclear waste until it reached saturation in 1994. According to :fr:Agence nationale pour la gestion des d√©chets radioactifs (ANDRA)'s inventory, the waste stored includes approximately 1,469,265 packages, corresponding to 527,225 m¬≥, mainly from nuclear power generation (nuclear power plants and facilities corresponding to nuclear fuel cycle front end and back end). Hurd's Deep, which is heavily polluted, is located in the vicinity.  History  In 1967, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission created Infratome, a private company which was a subsidiary of the :fr:Mines de potasse d'Alsace. After considering the Biville dunes, owned by the army, the decision was made to build the CSM to the east of the La Hague reprocessing plant, in a wetland area called the \\"Haut Marais\\". Today, a wetland would never be chosen to house a storage center.(fr) Centre de stockage de la Manche website sortir du nucl√©aire.. The local elected officials did not want the CSM to be managed by a private operator. As a consequence, the Atomic Energy Commission controlled the storage facilities until 1991, when the :fr:Agence nationale pour la gestion des d√©chets radioactifs (ANDRA: National Agency for Radioactive Waste Management), which had been an entity of the Atomic Energy Commission since 1979, took over the center as an independent public institution (created by the law of 30 December 1991). The first waste received in 1969 was hospital waste, in particular radium used for cancer treatment. Storage consisted at the beginning in ordinary trenches, in the ground. Then the safer and easier storage on the surface is adopted: Concrete blocks are poured around the casks, then covered with a plastic film and earth. The result of storage on the surface is called a \\"tumulus\\". In 1976, an accident occurred that caused tritium pollution of the aquifer and water on the surface. For several years, plutonium, radium, thorium, and waste containing tritium from the all of the French nuclear power plants had been stored in 6 vaults in a structure called TB2. The leaks would be due to an overflow at the surface of the deep drainage network on the grounds of heavy rainfalls and malfunctions of the lifting pump. In 1984, storage structures were restored ( trenches in the ground and concrete-walled trenches) and packages were taken back and reconditioned, improving their containment. In 1991, the construction of the center's roof began. It is intended to protect the packages from water infiltration. In 1994, the last package was received, then the storage was closed by the ANDRA in order to prepare the transition into the monitoring phase (planned for a period of around 300 years). In 2003, a decree authorized the center to enter the transition into the monitoring phase website legifrance.  Remarks  In 1996, two official reports showed that the site safety studies were positive.

With other performers, they gave concerts in London (in venues including the Queen's Hall, St James's Hall and the Steinway Hall) and elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. In the early years of the trio, they played music of the classical period and of the 19th century. A reviewer of a concert given in St James's Hall in May 1902, during which they played a trio by Brahms, wrote that the trio \\"have long since made a name for themselves as intelligent and interesting players.... The effects of continuous practice are very evident in their playing, and their ensemble was excellent.\\" (The Times, 17 May 1902). The sisters were also teachers. =Early music= From the early twentieth century they played early music. One such concert, in 1906, of works by J. S. Bach, Purcell, William Boyce, Domenico Scarlatti and others, took place in the Broadwood Rooms in London. A reviewer wrote that the music was played \\"with just the right feeling, quite simply and straightforwardly, like everything else that these players gave us, and without the slightest pose or attempt at archaism....\\" (The Times, 19 May 1906). They sometimes played on early instruments: Kate Chaplin played a viola d'amore (named \\"The Dragon\\") made by George Saint-George in 1899, and Mabel Chaplin played a viola da gamba. In a revival in 1920 of The Beggar's Opera, at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, the sisters, playing harpsichord, viola d'amore e viola da gamba, and other musicians formed the orchestra.

Biography  Son of Ugo and Jole Nizzoli, accounting clerks who represent the typical petty bourgeoisie between the two world wars, Umberto Mariani grew up within a family environment that was however permeated by strong ideals. This is highlighted by his father's active participation in the anti-fascist struggle. In 1943-1944, their home in Milan served as a refuge for groups of persecuted Jews, protected and helped by the clandestine organization headed by Fernanda Wittgens. The experience of war leaves significant marks on the very young Mariani's spirit. He completes his artistic studies, first at the Liceo Artistico and then, in the same historical building, from 1954 to 1958 at the Accademia di Brera, in the school of Achille Funi, where he becomes his assistant. In the years between 1959 and 1965, he closely collaborated with his master in the realization of numerous, magnificent decorative frescoes. He also collaborates on the altarpiece of San Giuseppe in the Basilica of San Pietro in Rome (central altar in the left transept). Through these experiences he acquires the skill to work on a large scale, a skill he will use in the years to follow.  I Piombi  The exhibition in Florence Mariani chez Capucci From 1990, Mariani begins to work from the subject of drapery that he is passionate about, and creates in his works known as I Piombi a stylized and geometrized idea of this subject matter. The drapery loses all true form, and the works crystallize in straight lines that look to affirm a more idealistic, symbolic vision. In 2011, the exhibition Le Vesti di Saturno is held in the prestigious halls of the Medici Gallery in Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence. The solo exhibition entitled Recent Works-Piombi followed in 2013 in the Baroque spaces of the Sala San Ignazio in Arezzo and later that year, the anthological exhibition Umberto Mariani-Opere 1967-2013 (catalogue edited by Allemandi) takes place in the Chiostri di San Domenico in Reggio Emilia. Opera Gallery, present with twelves offices located over 5 continents, sign an exclusive contract to organize shows of Mariani's work in Paris, New York and Hong-Kong. The art fairs in Reggio Emilia and Parma show personal exhibitions in 2014 and 2015 respectively and in 2015 a major environmental work entitled Plutone and Dioniso-Omaggi a Dag Hammarskjoeld, a eulogy to peace, is exhibited in the Museum of Wall Paintings in Prato. In 2016 the solo show entitled Mariani chez Capucci takes place at the Capucci Foundation located in Villa Bardini in Florence. Exhibition at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg In November and December 2016, an anthological exhibition is organized at the Mudima Foundation in Milan with 50 works ranging from 1967 to 2016.

It has feathery antennae. Biology and lifecycle M. paradoxus is primarily a parasitoid of the common wasp Vespula vulgaris. Adult females lay eggs in decaying wood in autumn, which hatch in spring or summer. The first instar triungulin clings to a V. vulgaris worker to be transported to the nest. Once at the nest, the larva parasitises a wasp larva - once the larva has closed the cell, the M. paradoxus larva consumes the host and pupates in its place. Adults emerge from late July to early October. The development from larva to adult takes less than one month. Adult beetles probably don't feed and live for between 6 and 12 days.

Bimetallic nano materials can be in the form of alloys, core-shell, or contact aggregate. Due to their novel properties, they have gained a lot of attention among the scientific and industrial communities. When used as catalysts, they show improved activity as compared to their monometallic counterparts. They are cost-effective, stable alternatives that exhibit high activity and selectivity. Hence a lot of effort has been put into the advancement of these catalysts. The combination or the type of metals present, how they are combined, and their size determines their properties. Since two distinct metals are combined, optimizing their properties through manipulation is possible. There is a lot of flexibility in designing the bimetallic nanoparticle for specific applications. There are several techniques developed for their synthesis and accurate characterization. Improved electronic properties that arise due to bi- metallization is the most important among the novel properties. Electronic effects involve charge transfer or orbital hybridization between the constituent metals. Structural changes can result from alloy formation. The chemical and environmental parameters during their synthesis play a role in determining their structural properties. The difference in the reduction rates of the different metal precursors decides the end structural properties of the nanomaterial. The synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles can be done using co- reduction, successive reduction, reduction of complexes containing both the metals and electrochemical methods. Co-reduction and successive reduction methods are the most popular preparative techniques.  Methods of synthesis  = Co-reduction method = The co-reduction method is similar to that of the reduction method used in the synthesis of monometallic nanoparticles. The difference is that for bimetallic nanoparticle synthesis two metal precursors will be used instead of one. The two precursors along with the stabilizing agent are completely dissolved in a suitable solvent. The metals will be present in their ionic states. To convert them into their zerovalent states a reducing agent is added. The light transition metals have lower reduction potential which means that they are rarer to undergo reduction. These light transition metals when present in their zerovalent states tend to undergo oxidation very quickly and therefore are unstable. Since these metals are very important in the field of catalysis, several methods to stabilize them are sought after. = Successive reduction method = In the successive reduction method, the two precursors are added one after the other. This method generally leads to the formation of core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles. The precursor of the metal that has to form the core is added along with the stabilizing agent first. This is followed by the reducing agent. Once the complete reduction of the first metal is ensured, the second metal precursor is added. The second metal ion gets adsorbed on the nanoparticle surface and gets reduced. This results in the core-shell structure of the bimetallic nanoparticle. Reduction of bimetallic complexes A complex containing both the metals to be present in the bimetallic nanoparticle is taken as the precursor. The aqueous solution of these complexes in different concentrations is taken in a quartz vessel and reduced using a photoreactor. Polyvinylpyrrolidone can be used as a stabilizer. The size and composition of the nanoparticles vary with the concentration of the aqueous solution. The composition of the nanoparticles can be analyzed using EDX studies. = Electrochemical method = In chemical methods, the metal ions are reduced to their zerovalent states using a reducing agent. In the electrochemical process, bulk metal is converted into metal atoms. The size of the particle synthesized using this method can be controlled by manipulating the current density. There are two anodes made up of the constituent bulk metal and a platinum metal plate is used as the cathode. The stabilizing agent is mixed with the electrolyte. When current is passed ions of the metals are formed at the anode and are reduced by the electrons generated in the platinum electrode. The major attractions of this method are its cost-effectiveness, high yield, ease of isolation, and the ability to control the composition of metal simply through variation of current density.  Structures of Bimetallic nanoparticles  = Crown jewel structure = In this type of arrangement, the more expensive or catalytically important metal atom is individually arranged over the comparatively cheaper metal which is catalytically less active. The precious metal atom will be surrounded by the less expensive metal atoms. As they are present on the surface they are highly accessible for catalytic reactions. Being surrounded by the less expensive metal also alters its electronic properties, this, in turn, improves its catalytic property. As the metal atoms are fixed on the surface individually, the synthesis of crown jewel structure is difficult. It can be achieved through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The metal is atomized using an electron beam evaporator and the whole process was carried out in an ultra-high vacuum. The metal gets diffused and deposits at different points on the less expensive metal surface. Their distribution can be determined by controlling the metal flux in a reproducible manner. Another alternative is the solution state method. Control of size and distribution is more complicated when using this method as opposed to CVD. = Hollow structure = The structures have a very high surface to volume ratios and porosity. This material is multifunctional owing to its unique structure. The void can be used to encapsulate various multifunctional nanomaterial or even as a nanoreactor. Their shells can also be functionalized. These materials are better catalysts as they are cheaper, less dense and the material is also saved. They can be synthesized by using already prepared metal nanoparticles as sacrificial templates. This takes place through a galvanic replacement reaction in which a metal nanoparticle comes in contact with a different metal of higher reduction potential gets replaced. The diffusion process and direction of the reaction can be controlled by changing the chemical environment. = Core-shell structure = As catalysis is carried out on the nanoparticle surface, the atoms at the center are wasted. This becomes more important when expensive metals are used as catalysts. To reduce the cost of the catalysts an inexpensive metal is made the core and the catalytically active metal is taken as the shell. This is achieved by first reducing the core metal followed by nucleation of the shell metal around it. The core metal also electronically modifies the shell and thereby improves catalytic activity. They can be synthesized by using a one-pot co-reduction method. Two metal precursors are added simultaneously. One of them will reduce first due to the difference in the reduction potentials of the different metal ions. This metal will form the core. The pre-formed nanoparticle acts as the seed required for the nucleation of the second metal around it. These structures can be characterized using TEM imaging. The shape and size can be manipulated by varying the different parameters. It is possible to synthesize a more complex multiwalled nanostructure, but it will require better control over the parameters. = Alloyed structure = The two different metals present are homogeneously arranged. Due to the variation in their standard reduction potentials the metals tend to nucleate separately and form heterostructures or core-shell. Synthesizing alloyed bimetallic nanoparticles require control over reaction kinetics. Using a reducing agent strong enough to reduce both the metal ions is one option. Sodium borohydride is one such reducing agent. Another option is the selection of appropriate counter ion or surfactant. The redox potentials of the metals are adjusted in such a way as to obtain simultaneous reduction through specific coordination or adsorption. The addition of a metal ion that facilitates alloy formation is the third method. A gas-phase synthesis technique is also possible in which the atoms are first brought to their atomic states. But this method will require complicated instrumentation.

In addition, there is also abandoned temple that have been built since the Ayutthaya period, namely Wat Suan Sawan, or locally known as Bot Rang (\\"abandoned sanctuary\\"). What makes Bang Yi khan the most well-known is the location of a liquor factory believed to have been established since the King Rama I's reign in early Rattanakosin period. Until during World War II this factory became under supervision of government and was named \\"Bang Yi Khan Liquor Factory\\". Told that in those days, yeasts that the factory released into Chao Phraya River, attract toli shad (Tenualosa toli) to swim from the sea into freshwater to eat them as food. Currently, the liquor factory has been shut down and its location became a Rama VIII Memorial Park, a good atmosphere public park under the foot of Rama VIII Bridge.

Through the use of information, demand of labor market, and placement, PES authorities try to prevent unemployment within the public sector (concerning jobs within the government agency). In the European Union, the idea of establishing these services was imposed by the European Council and European Parliament in order to improve the matter of unemployment in this geographical sector. The official name of this authory is The European Network of Public Employment Services. Its responsibilities include: # Comparing the PES performance between the European countries through the process of benchmarking, # Finding the best practices and mutually learning from one another, more of which can be found in the PES Knowledge Center, # Learning about the effect of modernization and improving the PES services delivery, including the Youth Guarantee (a commitment by all Member States to make sure that all young people under the age of 25 have a good quality to continued education, employment, apprenticeship and traineeship),and lastly, # Preparing the inputs to European Employment Strategy and the correlating policies regarding labor market. A Board is responsible for governing this network, in which each of the Member States and Commission are represented by two members. The meetings of the Board take place twice a year in order to promote strategic discussions and make decisions regarding the further activities of the Network.  Challenges of Public Employment Services in Europe  Some of the challenges that the labor market experiences in relation to public employment services include demographic factors, globalization, technological changes, labor market challenge, or a rising income inequality. = Demographic = Demographic factors show that population trends will have a severe impact on the labor market. Over the next 30 years, the European Union will encounter with the problem of population aging. In various European countries, the working population in the economies are already suffering from lack of skills in different occupations and sectors in the economy. The Public Employment Services are responsible for engaging the inactive people and focus on improving employability according to the challenges that these particular people face in different ages. = Globalization = Globalization leads labor market to constantly evolving as a result of increasing use of mobile technologies and connections via Internet. Business try to increase their value through the restructuring processes while placing value of business innovations and upskilling of their labor in order to withstand the competition. Therefore, globalization stretches the importance of reemployment and upskilling of the workers who had been redundant due to restructuring processes. Public Employment Services in EU are therefore requiring improving the employability of people, support job-to-job transition and support the restructuring process of employers. = Technology = Technology has been constantly evolving, causing the labor market to shift as well. Specifically, the shift from primary and manufacturing sectors towards more knowledge-based services and activities. This means that technology makes progress and greater productivity improvements, including the use of machinery, or turning manual tasks into automated. And as it does, the global trends lean towards less employment in manufacturing sectors. Even though a shift towards knowledge- based services allows for opportunities, there is a risk of those opportunities to be taken unequally to the employees. Therefore, public employment services are required to serve as an instrument to offer better opportunities to the disadvantaged ones by providing skills and knowledge to help withstand the technological progress. = Labor Market Skill Mismatch = Countries incapability to adapt workers‚Äô skills to the certain unmet demand for labor, limits them to excel in the economy. While under-qualification is an issue mostly in the low-income countries, the advanced and developed countries, including most of the European Union member states, struggle with an ample number of workers who are actually over-qualified. This brings another task for public employment services to collaborate with labor market stakeholders in order to improve and eventually develop the skills of the labor force to meet the demands. = Rising Income Inequality = The increasing gap between rich and poor in European countries sets another challenge for the labor market. Research shows that a quarter of developed countries had become the richest 10 percent of the population in 2011. Public Employment Services can be used as an instrument to confront the income inequality and make it smaller, since a reason for such inequality may be attributed to long-term stagnation of growth in developed countries and low incidence of growth bursts in the developing countries.  The ‚ÄúStart and Improve Your Business‚Äù Program  In connection with International Labor Organization, the Public Employment Services around the world are cooperating on a new program called Start and Improve Your Business. This program is a management-related training programme which focuses on starting and enhancing the quality of small businesses, promoting this as a strategy to provide men and women around the world with employment. SIYB is currently translated into 40 languages and functions in more than 100 countries, including the European member states. This program aims has been able to train 15 million people and had resulted in at least 2.65 million new businesses worldwide, helping mostly developing economies, but also focusing on European countries.  EU Network of Public Employment Services: Strategy 2020  Due to challenges which are imposed by frictional unemployment and structural unemployment, European Public Employment Services are required to adapt their services. The document of EU Network of 2020 Strategy represents the common strategy to be promoted by the PES Network and build off of previous amendments. It sets direction of the future arrangements and changes relating to the unemployment issue. According to the decision of the European Council and the European Parliament made in May 2014, the formal legal entity has been given to the former network of Heads of Public Employment Services (HoPES). The mission of the PES Network is as follows: ‚Äúto be the vehicle for enhanced European PES cooperation enabling them to deliver their role as labor market conductors, contributing to European employment strategies, improving labor market function, integration and creating better balanced labor markets‚Äù. Its goals which are designed to promote modernization of the public employment services, include: * Boosting the labor demand and promote voluntary employment * Increase of the capacity of job offers to improve labor market function * Anticipating the demand by using labor market information, and * Prepare the labor force for the active labor market participation The latest update from the European Commission suggests that the duration of the EU Decision for establishing the Network of Public Employment Services has extended until 2027.  Conclusion  Public Employment Services should be evidence-based, flexible and employment focused organizations. The objectives of these authorities in European Union are primarily their engagements with customers. They need to promote continual employment focus, account for the labor market knowledge and skills needed to withstand the pressure of this market. European PES/authorities share the values of respect, social responsibility, honesty and engagement as a part of the European Network. In order to put the requirements into long-term practice, these authorities will need to align the demand of both firms as well as the potential employees.

It is a grade I listed building. History The origins of the church are unclear. The current building was erected in the 12th century but there may have been an Saxon church on the site previously. The chancel was rebuilt in the 1460s and there was some further rebuilding in 1830. A Victorian restoration was carried out by Sidney Gambier-Parry in 1889. The parish is part of the Churn Valley benefice within the Diocese of Gloucester.

The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale, and caused effects in a vast area extending from Izmit to Tekirdaƒü. In this area, the earthquake was followed by a tsunami which caused significant damage. The earthquake of 1766 was the last major earthquake to rock Istanbul because of a rupture of the North Anatolian Fault in the Marmara region. Geology The Sea of Marmara is a pull-apart basin formed at a releasing bend in the North Anatolian Fault (\\"NAF\\"), a right-lateral strike-slip fault. East of the Sea of Marmara the NAF splits in three major branches; while the sinuous southern branch goes inland in direction SW up to Ayvacik, where it reaches the Aegean Sea near the southern mouth of the Dardanelles, the other two major branches (northern and central) of the NAF, being under the sea of Marmara about apart, form the Marmara pull- apart basin, meeting again under the NE Aegean. This local zone of extension occurs where this transform boundary between the Anatolian Plate and the Eurasian Plate steps northwards to the west of Izmit from the Izmit Fault to the Ganos Fault. Inside the Sea of Marmara there is a smaller pull-apart basin, named the North Marmara fault System (\\"NMFS\\"), which connect the three submarine basins (from W to E: Tekirdaƒü, Central and √áƒ±narcƒ±k) with the Izmit and Ganos Fault (both inland). Near Istanbul the northern side of the NMFS pull-apart coincides with the northern branch of the NAF and is a single main fault segment with a sharp bend. To the west, the fault trends W-E and is pure strike-slip in type. To the east, the fault is NW-SE trending and shows evidence of both normal and strike-slip motion. In 1766, the rupture of the fault happened either under the Princes' Islands or, more probably, under the √áƒ±narcƒ±k Basin, since a more central break could not have caused the great tsunami that struck Istanbul and the Gulf of Izmit, although this had been produced by a submarine landslide. The 1766 event has been the last one caused by a rupture of the NAF in the Marmara region; successive large events which caused extensive damages in Istanbul, like the earthquake of 10 July 1894 (with epicenter in the gulf of Izmit) and that of 9 August 1912 (with epicenter NW of Marmara Island), have to be considered isolated events caused by the non uniform stress relief during the 18th century earthquake sequence, to which the 1766 event belongs. Since the second last major event with an epicenter in the Istanbul region occurred in 1509, a recurrence interval of 200‚Äì250 years has been hypothesized. Characteristics The earthquake began half an hour after sunrise, at 5:10 a.m. on May 22, 1766, which was the third day of the Kurban Bairam. The first shock, accompanied by a loud roar, lasted two minutes: it was followed by a less intense shock lasting four minutes, and aftershocks continued for eight minutes. In the following weeks there were also several aftershocks, and the duration of the whole sequence amounted to one year. Mathematical models of this event using Coulomb stress transfer are consistent with a fault rupture whose length ranges from . The earthquake was felt as far away as Aydin, Thessaloniki, on Mount Athos, Aytos in eastern Bulgaria and along the west coast of the Black Sea. This earthquake was compared to the catastrophic one in Lisbon, which occurred 11 years earlier. Damage complex (here in 1559 in a drawing of Melchior Lorck) were destroyed in 1766 The estimated area of significant damage (greater than the MCS VII grade (Very Strong)) extends from Bursa to K√º√ß√ºk√ßekmece, but destruction occurred from Tekirdaƒü and Gelibolu to the west, Izmit to the east and Edirne to the north. The settlements on the Gulf of Mudanya also suffered damage, while Galata and B√ºy√ºk√ßekmece were severely damaged. In Constantinople the intensity of the earthquake was estimated between grade VII and VIII-IX; many houses and public buildings collapsed. Furthermore, part of the underground water distribution system was destroyed; the Ayvad dam, on the upper K√¢ƒüƒ±thane, was damaged, and in Istanbul the vault of an underground cistern subsided. In Istanbul, most of the mosques and churches were damaged, as was the Topkapi palace: the sultan had to live in temporary housing until his home was restored. The panicking populace was unable to go back home, and people sheltered themselves in tents pitched in wide and open spaces. Among the imperial mosques, the dome of that of Bayezid was damaged, while the minaret and the main dome of the mosque of Mihrimah collapsed. The S√ºleymaniye Mosque was also damaged, while the Fatih mosque suffered the collapse of the minarets, the main dome and several secondary domes, and 100 students in the Koran school of the K√ºlliye died; so the complex had to be rebuilt. The Kariye Mosque was also seriously damaged, but the mosque of Ayasofya survived instead almost unharmed. The castle of Yedikule, Eƒürikapƒ±, Edirnekapƒ± and the city walls were also damaged, while there were damages to Galata and Pera and to the Grand Bazaar. At √áatalca and in the surrounding villages all the masonry buildings collapsed. Since the earthquake struck the eastern part of the Sea of Marmara, serious damage was also recorded on the southern shore, from Mudanya to Karam√ºrsel, and the tsunami waves made the ports unusable. The highest level of the tsunami was observed in the Bosphorus region; the flood was also strong on the shores of Galata and Mudanya, while some small islands in the Marmara Sea were partially submerged. =Casualties= The number of deaths was estimated at 4,000, of which 880 were in Istanbul.  August earthquake  In August of the same year, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck the Dardanelles region. On that occasion the damage in Istanbul was slight.

Intel Xe includes a new instruction set architecture ‚Äì the technology is expected to become available with Intel's Tiger Lake products. The Xe GPU family consists of a series of graphics chips from low power (integrated, entry-level) to mid-range, (Xe-HP), enthusiast/high performance gaming (Xe-HPG) and datacenter/high performance computing (Xe-HPC). History Intel's first attempt at a dedicated graphics card was the Intel740, released in February 1998. Released to a hyped audience, the Intel740 was a disappointment and failure due to its performance being below expectations, being discontinued just 18 months after release. However, its technology lived on in the Intel Extreme Graphics lineup. Intel made another attempt with the Larrabee before cancelling it in 2009; this time, the technology developed was used in the Xeon Phi, which was discontinued in 2020. In April 2018, it was reported that Intel was assembling a team to develop discrete graphics processing units, targeting both datacenters, as well as the PC gaming market, and therefore competitive with products from both Nvidia and AMD. Rumors supporting the claim included that the company had vacancies for over 100 graphics-related jobs, and had taken on former Radeon Technologies Group (AMD) leader Raja Koduri in late 2017 ‚Äì the new product was reported to be codenamed \\"Arctic Sound\\". The project was reported to have initially been targeting video streaming chips for data centers, but had its scope expanded to include desktop GPUs. In June 2018, Intel confirmed it planned to launch a discrete GPU in 2020. In September 2019, hothardware.com reported that the Xe graphics (formally \\"Gen 12\\") would represent a large change in the instruction set architecture (ISA) of Intel's GPUs, with practically all instruction encodings being altered. The Xe graphics ISA is expected to ship with the Tiger Lake product line. The first functional discrete \\"Xe\\" GPU, codenamed \\"DG1\\", was reported as having begun testing in October 2019. According to a report by hexus.net in late 2019, a discrete GPU would launch in mid 2020; combined GPU/CPU (GPGPU) products were also expected, for data center and autonomous driving applications. The product is expected to be initially built on a 10 nm node (with 7 nm products in 2021) and use Intel's Foveros die stacking packaging technology (see 3D die stacking). Intel officially announced their Xe general HPC/AI GPU codenamed Ponte Vecchio on November 17, 2019. The chip is to use Intel's 'Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge' (EMIB) and Foveros die stacking packaging on a 7 nm node. The new GPU is expected to be used in Argonne National Laboratory's new exascale supercomputer, Aurora, with compute nodes comprising two Intel Xeon (Sapphire Rapids) CPUs, and six Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

It also administered a number of other TA and Supplementary Reserve (SR) signal units based at Fulham House: Fulham House * 204th Medium Artillery Signal Section (TA) * No 22 (London) Cable Section (SR) * No 25 (London) Construction Section (SR) * No 1 (London) Air Wing Signal Section (SR) * No 10 (London) Air Squadron Signal Section (SR) The first Commanding Officer (CO) was Lieutenant- Colonel William Fox Bruce, DSO, MC, who had been captured during the German Spring Offensive of 1918 while commanding 47th Signal Company.Burke's, 'Baron Aberdare'.Maude, p. 161; Appendix D. To meet the growing threat of air attack, a number of TA units began to be converted to the anti-aircraft (AA) role during the 1930s. On 16 December 1935, 47th (2nd London) Divisional HQ was redesignated 1st AA Division (for which London District Signals provided the communications), while 47th Divisional Signals became London Corps Signals.Edwards, p. 113. London Corps Signals also administered 204th Medium Regiment and 206th Field Regiment Signal Sections (TA) and 2 (London) Company Air Formation Signals (SR), and had A Company 1st West London Cadet Corps affiliated to it.Lord & Watson, pp. 243‚Äì4. World War II =Mobilisation= When the TA was doubled in size in early 1939 after the Munich Crisis, the unit split to form 1st and 2nd (London) Corps Signals. However, on the outbreak of war these were redesignated, the 1st Line unit joining Lt-Gen Alan Brooke's II Corps with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) as 2nd (London) Corps Signals, while the 2nd Line unit was earmarked for IV Corps in 1940 but became 5th (London) Corps Signals.Lord & Watson, p. 243.Roberts, p. 5. Organisation In 1939, the organisation of a corps signal unit was as follows:Lord & Watson, p. 262. * HQ * 1 Company - for construction ** 4 line- laying sections ** 1 line maintenance section * 2 Company ‚Äì operating ** 3 operating sections ** 3 wireless sections ** 2 messenger sections (each of 1 Sergeant and 24 despatch riders) * 3 Company ‚Äì corps artillery ** 1 section for each artillery regiment In 1941, 1 Company supported the Main Corps HQ and 2 Company supported Rear HQ. By 1943 corps signal units had disbanded their third company and divided its duties between signal troops assigned to individual artillery regiments and the new Army Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs). Finally, in 1944, 1 and 2 Companies supported Main HQ, a new 3 Company was formed for line construction and a new 4 Company supported Rear HQ. =2nd (London) Corps Signals= The unit was warned for mobilisation on 4 August 1939 and was embodied at Fulham House on 25 August. It moved to Ludgershall, Wiltshire, on 1 September, from where all soldiers under the age of 19 were returned to Fulham House to join the 2nd Line unit still being formed. 2nd (L) Corps Signals returned to Sutton, London, on 14 September and completed its war establishment. It embarked for France to join the BEF on 29 September. In December 1939 and January 1940 it was joined by Nos 10 and 11 Line Sections provided by the 2nd Line unit.Lord & Watson, p. 259. Battle of France A Royal Signals cable-laying party using poles to cross a road in France. Once concentrated, II Corps moved on 12 October up to the French frontier.Ellis, France and Flanders, Chapter II.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 10‚Äì3. When the German offensive in the west opened on 10 May 1940. the BEF advanced into Belgium in accordance with 'Plan D'.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter III. However, the German Army broke through the Ardennes to the east, forcing the BEF to withdraw again, by 19 May the whole force was back across the Escaut and then went back to the so-called 'Canal Line'.Bryant, pp. 91‚Äì128.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter IV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter VIII. By 26 May the BEF was cut off and the decision was made to evacuate it through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo), with II Corps acting as flank guard against the German penetration where the Belgian Army had surrendered.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XI.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIII. The last of the BEF who could enter the Dunkirk bridgehead had done so by 29 May and the evacuation progressed: III Corps went first, followed by II Corps after handing over responsibility for the eastern flank to the rearguards of I Corps. Most of II Corps was evacuated on the night of 31 May/1 June.Bryant, pp. 128‚Äì53.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XIV.Ellis, France & Flanders, Chapter XV. After evacuation the signal unit was due to return to France as part of the Second BEF that was being organised, but on the surrender of France it was instead sent to Northern Ireland as 6th (London) Corps Signals. Middle East and Mediterranean In 1941 the unit was redesignated again as 3rd (London) Corps Signals and sent to join Middle East Forces. At this time III Corps was a deception HQ in Persia and Iraq Command (Paiforce). In 1942 3rd (L) Corps Signals spun off a separate 21st Corps Signals for Paiforce. This unit later became Eastern Command Signals in India and was disbanded on Indian independence in 1947. 3rd (L) Corps Signals also spun off 3 Army Signals, which served in the Middle East for the rest of the war. In 1944 3rd (L) Corps Signals was reorganised as No 18 Line of Communication Signals and sent to the Italian Front. After 1943, a Line of Communication signal unit was intended to be organised as follows:Lord & Watson, p. 265. * 1 HQ signal troop * 6 construction troops * 2 terminal equipment troops * 6 telegraph operating troops * 4 despatch rider troops * 2 technical maintenance troops * 4 medium wireless troops * 2 telephone switchboard * 2 cipher troops After a short spell in Italy, 18 LoC Signals served in Greece during the British occupation and civil war that followed the German withdrawal. The unit was demobilised there in 1946. =5th (London) Corps Signals= V Corps' formation sign during World War II While the 1st Line unit went to France, the 2nd Line continued to absorb recruits and train at Fulham House and various locations round Putney and Wandsworth. During the winter it sent 10 and 11 Line Sections to join 2nd Corps, and in April 1940 it provided a cadre of 150 men to form 7th Corps Signals. Also in April five of its sections (5 Line Maintenance, 9 Wireless, 13 Operating and 25 and 28 Line Sections) were mobilised for overseas service, though this did not happen. In early May some subunits were detached for training to South Shields and Portsmouth, and on their return the whole unit (six officers and 250 other ranks) moved to Old Dean Common Camp in Aldershot Command and then to Minley Manor, which it shared with 4th (North Midland) Corps Signals. The intention was that the London unit would take over as 4th Corps Signals while the North Midland unit would join the North Western Expeditionary Force (NWEF) in the Norwegian campaign. However the evacuations from Norway and France disrupted all arrangements: both units provided personnel to reform 2nd (L) Corps Signals after its evacuation from Dunkirk (see above) and 5th (L) Corps Signals resumed its title.Roberts, pp. 5‚Äì6. V Corps HQ under Lt-Gen Claude Auchinleck was formed from the NWEF HQ on 17 June 1940 at Tidworth Camp in Southern Command. Here it was joined by 5th (L) Corps Signals, initially accommodated at Bhurtpore Barracks and in a tented camp. Within a month Corps HQ was established at Melchett Court, near Salisbury, and 5th (L) Corps Signals at Cowesfield House, fully cabled, with the wireless sections at Deanhill Farm ('Radio City'), a pigeon loft at Red Lynch, and a Rear HQ signals office at Romsey. V Corps HQ was responsible for operational control and coast defence in Hampshire and Dorset, and had to respond to numerous false invasion alarms during the summer of 1940. Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery took over as General Officer Commanding (GOC) V Corps on 21 July 1940, and emphasised mobility for all units and HQs in its training exercises. The new GOC was ruthless in replacing officers who did not match up to his standards for fitness and ability.Roberts, pp. 6‚Äì7.Montgomery, pp. 70‚Äì4. An AEC Armoured Command Vehicle on exercise. V Corps HQ moved to Longford Castle in mid- September 1940, and 5th (L) Corps Signals was distributed as follows:Roberts, p. 7. * HQ at Alderbury * 1 Company at Whiteparish, Odstock, and West and East Dean, the remainder at Cowesfield House with the Technical Maintenance Section * 2 Company at Bodenham, Nunton, Farley and West Grimstead, with an element at Alderbury * 3 Company was in Nomansland * Telephone exchange at Downton with V Corps' Rear HQ The unit remained in this area until 1942, with frequent exercises of increasing complexity, 5th (L) Corps Signals deploying the new AEC Armoured Command Vehicle (EVC). In June 1942 V Corps was designated for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, and came under the command of First Army. V Corps HQ (now under Lt-Gen Charles Allfrey as GOC) and signals relocated to Hamilton Park Racecourse in Scotland where a series of embarkation and communication exercises were held. The ACVs were deemed unsuitable for North West Africa, and the signal equipment was transferred to soft-skin lorry command vehicles (LCVs). Then between 4 and 10 November the unit moved to Leith and Gourock to embark for the Torch convoys, with the following organisation:Roberts, pp. 7‚Äì9, Appendix II. * 5th (London) Corps Signals HQ * 1, 2, 3 Company HQs * 5 Technical Maintenance Section * 25, 28, 35 Line Maintenance Sections * 52 Line Maintenance Section (later 52 Terminal Equipment Section) * 13, 51 Operating Sections * 15 Operating Section (later 163 Tele-Operating Section) * 9, 10, 88 Wireless Telegraphy (W/T) Sections (including despatch riders and operating as Advanced and Rear Corps HQ operating sections) * 5 Corps Artillery Signal Section * 8 Cipher Section * 42 Signal Park (served all signal units in V Corps, closely associated with the unit though not formally part of it) * Light Aid Detachment, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) Operation Torch The Allied landings began on 8 November 1942 and the first section of 5th (L) Corps Signals landed at Algiers from SS Reina del Pacifico in Convoy KMS3 on 22 November. The rest of the unit followed on convoys KMS4 and KMS5, with the transport arriving on 27 November. Temporary Corps HQ and signals were established north of the city, and an advanced HQ at Ferme Fabre between Souk el Arba and Souk El Khemis in Tunisia. The first 5th (L) Corps Signals road convoy left Algiers at 07.40 on 1 December with some 250 personnel and drove hundreds of miles eastwards, reaching Ferme Fabre on 4 December, where the signal centre was established. V Corps HQ took over the front on 6 December. Wireless links were quickly established to First Army and 78th Division. Next day the civilian telephone network was utilised for links to First Army Command Post, and shortly afterwards wireless links were established to 6th Armoured Division and 'Blade Force'.Playfair & Molony, pp. 167, 183.Roberts, p. 13. By now the Axis forces had reacted strongly to the invasion and First Army's drive towards Tunis had been halted in the mountains, with V Corps engaged in hard fighting round Longstop Hill. For the next four months a series of actions was fought along this static line, and an extensive network of signal cables to formation HQs was repaired and laid, despite frequent breaks caused by air raids. 25 Line Section working in the forward areas had to be withdrawn following probes by enemy patrols. Corps Signal Office was established in a storm water culvert under a road, known as 'The Drain'. By May 1943 V Corps was poised for a final advance on Tunis, with the line sections working forwards along the two main axes of advance for 78th Division and 4th Division. Signals personnel helping the Royal Engineers clear minefields along these axes suffered several casualties. Rapid progress was made after Operation Strike was launched on 6 May, and 78th Division entered Tunis on 8 May; V Corps HQ moved up to Massicault the same day. The Tunisian campaign ended on 13 May and on 14 May Corps HQ and Signals moved into Carthage. Work continued to restore cable links and remove mines, but on 15 June the unit handed over its communication network to 1st Army Signals and moved west to rejoin V Corps HQ at Constantine.Playfair & Molony, pp. 188, 276, 282, 383‚Äì4, 395‚Äì8, 429, 436, 446‚Äì9, 458.Roberts, pp. 13‚Äì15. Italian Campaign V Corps was not involved in the subsequent Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) but was responsible for administering a number of units in North Africa. 5th (L) Corps Signals collected new equipment and undertook training, as well as lending sections to 15th Army Group HQ. At the end of August it received its orders for the Allied invasion of mainland Italy. On 11 September V Corps' Tactical HQ and Tactical Signals moved to Bizerta and embarked to join Eighth Army at Taranto; the rest of the unit moved to Philipeville on 16 September for embarkation. The main signal elements arrived on 20 September without their transport and set up in a grove some north of Taranto. The first ship carrying half the vehicles and equipment reached Brindisi on 27 September, but of the second ship, Ocean Stranger there was no sign. It had arrived at Salerno on the other side of Italy, where fighting was still going on and was at first unable to unload. 5th (L) Corps Signals was finally united at Canosa on 3 October.Molony, Vol V, pp. 242, 346.Roberts, pp. 15‚Äì20. On 10 October the unit moved up to Serracapriola and began establishing communications for the formations under corps command. Away from the coastal railway civil telephone lines were sparse, and the unit soon used up all the telephone poles in 42 Signal Park. Although power control circuits along the electricity supply pylons up the valleys could also be used, V Corps was faced with the necessity of greater use of wireless. By the end of October the unit's rear elements had joined from North Africa, on 2 November, following the crossing of the Trigno, it moved up to Termoli and on 8 November to Vasto. V Corps' next task was to cross the Sangro and tackle the Germans' Gustav Line. During the preparations the line sections had to instal cable down to the river under artillery fire, but the attack on 28‚Äì29 November succeeded, and cables were laid across the bridges laid by the Royal Engineers. Bad weather hampered further advances, but after 1st Canadian Division took Ortona, V Corps HQ moved forward to San Vito Chietino on 27 December, and then to Rocca San Giovanni on 3 January, remaining there until the end of the month.Molony, Vol V, pp. 455‚Äì61, 482‚Äì9, 505‚Äì9.Roberts, pp. 20‚Äì1. The Adriatic front in Italy was virtually shut down for winter, and at the end of January V Corps HQ and Signals was withdrawn to a rest area near Naples, though the signal unit lent a detachment to reinforce 2nd New Zealand Division's signallers in the Battle of Monte Cassino, which suffered some casualties. The Corps HQ returned to take over the Adriatic Front once more at the end of February, located at Paglieta. Directly under the command of Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), V Corps' task was to hold the front with the minimum number of troops and harass the enemy, while Eighth Army moved westwards. 5th (L) Signals maintained dummy signals traffic to conceal Eighth Army's move. While the front was static, the unit received new equipment, including teleprinters, and Jeeps to replace 15 cwt trucks, cars and motorcycles that were frequently stuck in mud. It also established line communications with Hermon Force, a mixed force operating high in the mountains with Pack transport. On 17 June V Corps HQ was relieved by II Polish Corps and withdrew to Campobasso in Army Group Reserve. The succeeding weeks were spent in training, though 5th (L) Corps Signals lent a wireless detachment to II Polish Corps for the Battle of Ancona in July.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 13, 29‚Äì30.Molony, Vol V, p. 594.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 12, 58.Roberts, pp. 21‚Äì2. Under its new GOC, Lt- Gen Charles Keightley, V Corps' next task was to act as a pursuit force after Eighth Army's expected breakthrough of the Gothic Line in Operation Olive. By the time the attack began, the corps' role had changed to an attempt to rush the Gothic Line by surprise, even though neither the HQ nor its divisions had carried out an offensive operation for many months. The first phase (25 August‚Äì3 September) went well and the German positions were overrun, Corps HQ and Signals moving up to Montegridolfo. But V Corps was checked at the Battle of Gemmano (4‚Äì15 September). The signallers following behind the advance had to deal with extensive demolitions and minefields, the three line sections as far forward as possible (reinforced by 21 Line Section to carry out maintenance in the rear) and the Tactical HQ signal office located on the edge of the gun line. By 5 September the main cable was through to Morciano di Romagna, but HQ did not follow until 15 September. The cable artery was across the river Conca by 19 September, at the cost of several casualties. By 20 September the enemy began to disengage, but the weather slowed the pursuit. On 6 October signal deception measures were instituted to give the false impression that further advance was impossible, but on the advance continued, with Corps HQ reaching Andrea di Bagnolo on 15 October with Signals HQ in nearby Borghi. Casualties among the signallers had already been heavy, but after the crossing of the Savio the campaign ground on, Corps HQ and Signals moving to Cesena (27 October) and then Bertinoro (11 November). The Marzino was crossed on 24 November and the Lanone the following day, but the rain caused the rivers to rise bye several feet and threaten cable links. Finally Faenza was taken on 27 December and the front stabilised along the river Senio. Snow brought down all the main signal circuits on 6 January 1945 and V Corps had to rely on wireless for several hours while the line sections worked to restore connections.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 126‚Äì7, 230‚Äì2, 237, 242‚Äì4, 250‚Äì61, 267‚Äì9, 277‚Äì8, 290‚Äì3, 351‚Äì4, 400‚Äì4, 409‚Äì10, 429‚Äì32.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 37‚Äì43, 49, 52‚Äì4, 114‚Äì6, 122‚Äì3, 158‚Äì9.Roberts, pp. 23‚Äì4. During the winter pause, as corps boundaries were adjusted, V Corps HQ and Signals moved to Terra del Sole by 19 January and then in early February to Villa Pasatoni with signals in the former I Canadian Corps' Signal Centre in Ravenna. To run the extensive signal network, 5th (L) Corps Signals was reinforced by 523 Basuto Signal Section. Operation Grapeshot began on 9 April, with Eighth Army pushing through the 'Argenta Gap' into the Po Valley, and V Corps HQ following in a series of short bounds. By 23 April the corps had closed up to the River Po, with HQ in Montesanto. The corps began crossing the Po the next day. 5th (L) Corps Signals had practised 'long span construction' for stringing signal cable across a wide obstacle, but its first cable across the river utilised a damaged railway bridge. A second, long span, crossing was swept away within 48 hours. By 29 April Corps HQ and Signals had reached Bosaro. On 2 May the German forces in Italy surrendered.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 263, 267, 271, 288‚Äì94, 319‚Äì20, 328.Roberts, p. 25. The German surrender did not end the rapid advance, as elements of Eighth Army continued on into Austria. V Corps HQ and Signals reached Noventa Padovana on 1 May, Udine on 4 May, and Tricesimo on 7 May. It had outrun its line communications and its wireless was overworked: additional sets were borrowed from Army, Division and Brigade signal units to control traffic at river crossings and along the roads crammed with formations moving north. V Corps entered Austria on 10 May and established its HQ at Pritschitz am Worthersee to begin occupation duties. The Austrian public telephone system could now be utilised and the wireless links closed down. By 16 June the HQ settled at Portschach am Worthersee, with signals in the Hotel Europa. Its role now was to provide communications for the units coping with the complexities of postwar Austria, with its roving bands of partisans, Prisoners of War to secure, and Displaced persons to deal with. At different points 5th (L) Corps Signals had a German signal company and a Hungarian unit under command. A rearrangement of occupation duties saw V Corps take over the Styria zone from Soviet forces, and a line section was despatched to establish communications with 46th Division at Graz.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 340, 347‚Äì8.Roberts, pp. 25‚Äì6. On 6 September 5 (L) Corps Signals began a move back to Salerno in Italy, to prepare for disbandment. During October the unit was reduced to 30 per cent of its war establishment and it was officially disbanded on 27 November 1945.Roberts, pp. 26‚Äì7. On disbandment, the cadre of 5th (L) Corps Signals consisting of men awaiting demobilisation took in reinforcements and formed 3 Company, 7 Headquarters Signals. This consisted of a despatch rider section, an operating section, two medium wireless sections, a terminal equipment section and a signals park, and began training for service in the Middle East. In February 1946 the remaining 5th (L) Corps men left for demobilisation and the company left Italy for Egypt.Roberts, p. 27; Appendix I. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the unit was reformed at Fulham House as 23rd (Southern) Corps Signal Regiment, under the command of Lt-Col E.W.G. Knight, who had been the last commanding officer of 18 LoC Signals. In 1955 the unit was renamed as 2nd Corps Signal Regiment (London), changing to 2nd (London) Signal Regiment in 1958. In 1960 the regiment regained its traditional number as 47 (London) Signal Regiment. However, the following year it merged with 40 (Middlesex Yeomanry) Signal Rgt to form 47 (Middlesex Yeomanry) Signal Rgt, later reduced to squadron status in 31 (City of London) Signal Regiment. Its successor unit is today's 31 (Middlesex Yeomanry and Princess Louise's Kensington) Signal Sqn in 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment.Middlesex Yeomanry at Regiments.org.31 Signal Rgt at Regiments.org. In 2010, 83 Support Sqn (the former London District Signals) of 31 Signal Sqn was renamed 47 Signal Troop to perpetuate the unit. The Troop is based in Uxbridge and Southfields.83 Support Sqn at British Army website71 Yeomanry Signal Rgt at British Army website Commanders =Commanding Officers= The following served as commanding officer of the unit and its successors:Roberts, Appendix I. 47th (2nd London) Divisional Signals * Lt-Col W.F.

The Bema of Phaidros is the marble platform created in the third century CETravlos, p.538Frantz suggests a likely date between circa 300 and 345 CE. Frantz, 1982, p.38 that served as stage front to the Theatre of Dionysos Athens. It is decorated with a Neo-Attic Roman sculpture of the Hadrianic or Antonine period, this sculpture was dismantled sometime in antiquity, moved from an unknown location,Travlos, p.538. and rebuilt into the Bema of the Theatre by Phaidros, archon of Athens.IG II2 5021, his inscription is preserved on the top flight of the stairs from the orchestra to the stage and reads: For you, lover of the sacred rites, this beautiful stage has been built by Phaidros, son of Zolios, archon of life-giving Athens. Four stone reliefs decorate the stage front illustrating scenes from the life of Dionysos they are: 1) The birth of Dionysos, 2) the entrance of Dionysos into Attica, 3) the sacred marriage of Dionysos and the Basilinna and 4) the enthronement of Dionysos. These scenes are framed by crouching silenoi. The sculpture, reading the viewer‚Äôs from right to left, begins with a scene that can be taken to be the birth of Dionysos. It consists of four figures beginning with a semi-draped seated figure who is likely Zeus facing him is a youth holding a small child, presumed to be Hermes and the infant Dionysos at the moment of his second birth from the thing of Zeus.Sturgeon, p.32 Framing the scene are two nude male figures each holding a shield, these have been conjectured to be either korybantes or kouretes.Sturgeon, p.34. These two types are often confused but distinct. The next slab represents the bestowing of the gift of wine, the introduction of the worship of Dionysos to Attica and alludes to the beginnings of tragedy.Sturgeon, p.37. Again there are four figures; reading right to left they are, a young male figure in a chlamys and lion skin gesturing to his right. Immediately next is a figure identified by his attributes of grapevine, leopard skin and cothurni as Dionysos. Between him and the adjacent figure to his right is a small altar, this latter figure may be Ikarios accompanied by his dog Maera and a tethered goat. To the viewer‚Äôs left is a draped female, possibly a maenad, sometimes identified as Erigone On the third slab are three figures with a fourth figure lost over time, they are conjectured to be, from left to right, Tyche Dionysos and Basilinna.Sturgeon, p.38 The final slab on the viewer‚Äôs far left consists perhaps of, from left to right, Tyche, Theseus, Basilianna, and Dionysos enthroned.Sturgeon, p.40. It is evident from the way in which the sculptures have been cut down in size to fit their present placement, and for chronological reasons, that they are reused, secondary material. No conclusive solution has been put forward for the original date or location of the sculptures, though it has been suggested that they may have been meant for the Scaenae frons of the high pulpitum built during the first half of the second century.Sturgeon, p.45 File:Theatre of Dionysos.
