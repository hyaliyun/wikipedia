It is a settlement which was developed over the ruins of the ancient Greek city of Aphrodisias. Aphrodisias was established in the 4th century BCE. Relocation The new village of Geyre was relocated from the \\"Old Geyre\\" location, and built by the Turkish government c. 1960, due to earthquake threats to its stone dwellings, and to protect the rediscovered (1957) archeological site and antiquities of a Bronze Age (3,000-2200 BCE) settlement, ancient Greek and Roman Aphrodisias, and Byzantine Stravopolis (c.3rd‚àíc.12th centuries).

Life After the death of his father Rao Maldeo on 7 November 1562 a fratricidal war for succession started and his younger brother Rao Chandra Sen crowned himself in the capital Jodhpur. However Chandrasen had no allies and all of his brothers and fellow rajput chieftains (apart from Mewar) stood against him. Chandrasen was left completely isolated in the war with the Mughal empire. Akbar's army occupied Merta in the same year and the capital in 1564. After Chandrasens death in 1581, the Marwar kingdom was broken and given to several Rajput chieftains who had helped Mughals against Chandrasen. The Raja of Bikaner was made the governor of Marwar, while the sons of Maldev were cast aside. Udai Singh later gained the favour of the Emperor and was made the Raja of Marwar in 1583. Most of the core territories of Marwar were given back, while other districts were given to the rajas of Amber and Bikaner for their loyalty. Unlike his predecessors, Udai Singh submitted to the Mughal emperor Akbar and joined in his service. He also had his daughter Jagat Gosain married to the Mughal crown prince Jehangir. He did not find the marriage to be degrading as Jehangir had Rajput blood in him from his mothers side.Sarkar, J.N. (1984, reprint 1994). A History of Jaipur, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , p.41 =Kalyandas Rathore= Historian Norman P. Ziegler relates two accounts of the death of Kalyandas Rathore. The version from the Rathore genealogy says Kalyandas took offence at Udai Singh giving his daughter, Jagat Gosain, to Jahangir in marriage, and threatened to kill both men. According to Ziegler, if this is true, the most likely explanation for Kalyandas' opposition is that the marriage implied a subservience that violated the Rajput code of honor. In this version of events, when news of Kalyandas's threats reached Akbar, the emperor ordered Udai Singh to kill Kalyandas. Whatever the cause of the break between Kalyandas and the Mughals, he fled to fort Siwana. Udai Singh pursued him and captured the fort in 1589. Kalyandas died in the fighting. Death Udai Singh died in Lahore, Punjab on 10 July 1595.Beveridge, H. (tr.) (1939, reprint 2000).

In the , Bluff had a population of 373 people. Geography The town is located on the Capricorn Highway in Central Queensland, north west of the state capital, Brisbane. Bluff's location between some of Queensland's largest coal mines and the port of Gladstone has led to it becoming a major interchange station for large coal trains, some up to two kilometres long. History Based on artefacts found on the nearby Blackdown Tableland National Park, Aboriginal people lived in this area for thousands of years. The first European settlement occurred in the district in the 1860s as early pastoralists moved to the area. The district was originally called Duckworth or Duckworth Creek, but in 1877 the name was changed to Bluff to match the name of the railway station. The Bluff name was derived from a local hill known as Arthur's Bluff. Duckworth Post Office opened by September 1906 (a receiving office had been open from late 1905) and was renamed Bluff in 1907. Duckworth Provisional School was established in January 1907 and opened in June 1907. However, the local people disliked the name Duckworth and a few months later, the name was changed to Bluff or Bluff Colliery Provisional School. On 1 January 1909, it became Bluff State School. At the 2011 census, Bluff had a population of 370. In the , Bluff had a population of 373 people.  Education  Bluff State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Main Street ().

Native to Australia and one of the country's most common pigeons, the common bronzewing is able to live in almost any habitat, with the possible exception of very barren areas and dense rainforests.  Description  Males of the species have pale-yellow to yellow-white foreheads, and pink breasts. Both males and females have an easily discernible white line around and proximate to their eyes. Common bronzewings also have patches of red, blue and green on their wings, a feature which is characteristic of all bronzewing pigeons. Young birds are usually duller in colour and browner than the mature common bronzewing. Rarely found far from a source of water, common bronzewings either travel alone or in pairs or in flocks, and are usually cautious, making approach by humans or other animals difficult. Common bronzewings are, on average, between 30 and 36 centimetres (12‚Äì14 in) in length. A feather showing the brilliant sheen of the bronzewing pigeon  Feeding  The common bronzewing's diet primarily consists of seeds and all varieties of vegetables. It searches for food in small groups. The search can sometimes last for days, and, since the pigeon must drink frequently, it utilizes watering holes or any other available source of water.  Breeding  Egg Common bronzewings construct a rough nest of twigs and sticks, which is placed low down in a tree or bush. The eggs hatch after a period of roughly 14 to 16 days, after being incubated by both the male and the female. Both parents share the responsibility of caring for the young. In common with other pigeons, common bronzewings release a milky substance from their crop to feed their young.

It is a non-profit organization. Circus Flora has become a touring show yet it performs annually in St. Louis, usually at the beginning of the month of June. It combines the venue of a one-ring circus with the performance trappings of theatre. Performances include aerialists, equestrian artists, acrobats, and trained animals. Each performance is accompanied by a live band. Live musicians allow the mood to be tailored to the live events happening in the ring ‚Äî down to every crash of the cymbal or beat of the snare drum. Circus Flora is styled after old Eastern-European circuses. For many years, Circus Flora has featured many and various members of the renowned Flying Wallendas family. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the 2007 performance as, \\"an entertaining mixture of thoroughly professional performances and 'Let's put on a show in the old barn.'\\" Early years Circus Flora was first performed as a commissioned work for the 1986 Spoleto Festival USA, an annual celebration of the performing and visual arts in Charleston, South Carolina. Based upon its favorable reception, it was then founded as a permanent organization by Ivor David Balding, Sheila and Sam Jewell and Alexandre Sacha Pavlata. Its intended mission is to both entertain and to educate. Circus Flora made St. Louis, Missouri its home in 1987 with assistance from Vince Schoemehl, the mayor of St. Louis at that time, and Richard Gaddes, then president of Grand Center, St. Louis's creative and cultural district. Since then, the Circus Arts Foundation of Missouri (CAFM) has been the parent non-profit organization under which Circus Flora operates. Namesake Flora, the Elephant, is the namesake of Circus Flora. The circus was named after Flora, the orphaned baby African elephant Balding had rescued two years earlier when ivory poachers in Africa killed her mother. For 15 years, Flora the elephant was a star of the circus. In 2000, she retired from stage life, and is now a resident of the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee. Geographic extent of performances Circus Flora has performed in the following cities: St. Louis, Missouri; The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.; The Spoleto Festival USA; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Scottsdale, Arizona; Cooperstown, New York; Norfolk, Virginia; Nantucket Island; and several other locations.

Several significant battles are recorded to have taken place in what is now known as Rajasthan. Hundreds of battles took place between Rajputs and foreign invaders ( ghori, ghaznavi, afghan, turks, arabs, lodhi, khilji, mughals ). Against the Arabs *Arab Invasion of Rajasthan (740) - An Arab invasion from the Umayyad Caliphite defeated several Indian Rajas and conquered modern day Rajasthan up to Chittor, ending the Mori dynasty. Bappa Rawal later defeated the Arabs near Chittor and forced them to retreat to Sindh.R. C. Majumdar 1977, p. 298-299. *Presence of a nationwide grand alliance between Indian kings is very rare. There was absolutely no break of conflicts among different powers. Rising power of Kanauj had already become a strong rival of Kashmir kingdom at North. Legendary Rajputs were yet then to be united. Chalukyas from the South were expanding their influence very fast through joining hands with smaller kingdoms. This policy of Chalukyas was posing a threat to other powerhouse of central India - the Gurjaras. Among all such chaos, the news came like a storm - that the defense of Sindh has fallen against arabic invasion. Magically, all battles and conflicts between all military powers of north and western India stopped. Once sworn enemies joined hands with each other overnight. Lalitaditya of Kashmir stood side by side with Yashovarman of Kanauj. Vikramaditya II, along with all his allies, immediately put an end with Nagabhatt I of Gurjaras. Warring tribes of Rajputs started to become united under Bappa Rawal. And most importantly, all these kingdoms decided to unleash their offensive power simultaneously in all fronts. This stubborn resistance proved to be too fatal for arabs.

The station is located in the downtown area, to the east of the hill Slottsfjellet. It is located at an altitude of above mean sea level, and is from Oslo Central Station. The current station is from 1915. History The first station at Knapl√∏kken was a railway station built by the private T√∏nsberg‚ÄìEidsfoss Line. It received a station building of the smallest type used on the line, with only two rooms, and consisted further of a passing loop and an outhouse. The station had an extensive track arrangement with seven tracks and place for 203 freight cars.Jakobsen (1993): 118 The station opened on 18 October 1901.Jakobsen (1993): 99 During the planning of TEB there was discussion about changing the state railway's line through town and building a new station. This would have allowed NSB trains avoid having to back from Jarlsberg Points. TEB therefore chose to build their station at Knapl√∏kken. Thus T√∏nsberg was served by four stations. NSB therefore decided that it would build the Vestfold Line through T√∏nsberg in a loop, build a new, common station for TEB and NSB, and align the Vestfold Line out of T√∏nsberg next to TEB.Aspenberg (1994): 148 As TEB's station was far too small to handle NSB's traffic, an all-new station was built at Knapl√∏kken.Jakobsen (1996): 38 The new line was taken into use on 1 October 1915 and the new station was completed in 1916.Aspenberg (1994): 150 At the time of the opening the station had of land, which was rented for 1 √∏re per square meter to the station employees. At the time of the opening the station had a station master, three clerks, six telegraphists, two foremen, a switcher, nine servicemen and an apprentice. On 11 May 1934, Norsk Spisevognselskap took over operation of the station restaurant. In 1948, a separate building for the restaurant was opened.Just (1949): 71 When the Vestfold Line first opened in 1881, T√∏nsberg was accessed to by means of a branch line running in a long tunnel through Slottsfjell. At that time the T√∏nsberg station was a terminal station and trains had to reverse direction in T√∏nsberg, usually the cars were pushed into the station. This was a cumbersome operation, and in 1915 the current layout was opened. Now trains from the east run in a loop around T√∏nsberg city before entering the station and no reversing is necessary.Sigurd H. Unneberg, Sem og Slagen, en bygdebok Bind 2, Kulturhistorie, del 2 . T√∏nsberg: H√∏gskolen i Vestfold, 2001. Relevant chapter is online here The loop does take up space however, and in 2002 the T√∏nsberg city council passed a resolution to replace the loop with a single line, reintroducing the simple cul-de-sac station. The Norwegian National Rail Administration, who owns the railway, protested, pointing out that turning trains around would hold it up for ten minutes. There have been calls to continue the discussion.Vil ha omkamp om jernbane (Wants a rematch over the railway) T√∏nsbergs Blad, November 17, 2005 Facilities T√∏nsberg was built as a first-class station, the station's upper story originally serving as a residence for the station master and offices which hosted TEB's administration. The ground floor consisted of a waiting room, ticket sales, office for the station master, a telegraphy room, a cargo handling room, all with central heating. The station building was originally supplemented with a cargo building. The station had four main tracks, three spurs and a branch to the port, which was part of TEB.

It was succeeded by The Big Move and GO Transit's Go 2020. History On June 15, 2007, Premier Dalton McGuinty and Minister of Transportation Donna Cansfield announced the government's plan to fund 52 projects in Ontario to improve transit services provided by GO Transit, the Toronto Transit Commission, York Region Transit's Viva bus rapid transit system, Durham Region Transit, Mississauga Transit, Brampton Transit, and the Hamilton Street Railway. Construction on of new or improved rapid transit was to start in 2008 and be in place by 2020. The Government of Ontario committed two-thirds of the estimated $17.5 billion cost, and asked the Government of Canada to provide the remaining one-third. Municipalities were not expected to contribute to the capital cost of the projects, but would be responsible for any operating subsidies required. Simultaneous with the announcement of MoveOntario 2020, the government announced its intention to fund the development of rapid transit in Kitchener-Waterloo in the same fashion as the MoveOntario projects (i.e., a two-thirds commitment, with the federal government paying the balance). Thus while the Kitchener-Waterloo RT project was not a formal part of MoveOntario 2020, the government promised to treat it in the same fashion as the MoveOntario 2020 projects. Despite this, the provincial government would ultimately fund just one third of the project, leaving the Region of Waterloo with a $250 million shortfall to cover, largely through increases to property taxes in the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo. The project was widely seen as a key campaign promise by McGuinty for the 2007 Ontario general election. MoveOntario 2020 initiatives subsequently fell under the umbrella of Metrolinx's regional transportation plan (RTP), called The Big Move. The final version of the RTP was released in November 2008.The Big Move Projects All projects subject to the review of Metrolinx. =GO Transit= GO Rail extensions *GO Lakeshore East rail line extension from Oshawa to Bowmanville *GO Richmond Hill rail line extension to Aurora Road GO Rail extensions/capacity expansions *GO Barrie rail line extension and capacity expansion from Bradford to Barrie GO Rail capacity expansions *GO Barrie rail line capacity expansion from Union Station to Bradford *GO Georgetown rail line (currently Kitchener line) capacity expansion from Union Station to Georgetown *GO Lakeshore West rail line capacity expansion by adding a third track from Port Credit to Oakville *GO Lakeshore West rail line capacity expansion by adding a third track from Burlington to Hamilton *GO Lakeshore East rail line capacity expansion by adding a third track from Union Station to Scarborough *GO Milton rail line capacity expansion from Union Station to Milton *GO Richmond Hill rail line capacity expansion from Union Station to Richmond Hill *GO Stouffville rail line capacity expansion from Union Station to Stouffville and extension of the line to Uxbridge New GO Rail lines *GO Crosstown rail line between Weston Road and the Don Valley *GO Crosstown rail line between the Don Valley and Agincourt via Leaside *GO rail line from Union Station to Bolton *GO rail line on the Havelock line from Agincourt to Pickering *GO rail line on the Seaton line from Agincourt to Brock Road in Pickering GO Rail conversion *GO Lakeshore rail line electrification (SuperGO) GO Bus Rapid Transit *GO Bus Rapid Transit along Highway 403 from Oakville GO rail station to Mississauga *GO Bus Rapid Transit northwest Toronto link from Renforth Drive to York University *GO Bus Rapid Transit on Markham Road from Highway 407 in Markham to Highway 401 *GO Bus Rapid Transit on Highway 401 from Markham Road in Scarborough to Pickering GO rail station *GO Bus Rapid Transit connector on Highway 427 from Renforth Drive to Highway 407 *GO Bus Rapid Transit along Highway 407 from York University to Langstaff (Yonge Street) and on to Markham Road *GO Bus Rapid Transit along Highway 407 from Burlington to Highway 401 *GO Bus Rapid Transit along Highway 407 from Highway 401 to Highway 427 *GO Bus Rapid Transit along Highway 407 from Highway 427 to York University =Toronto Transit Commission= Spadina Line extension into York Region.

A vice admiralty court is in effect an admiralty court. The word ‚Äúvice‚Äù in the name of the court denoted that the court represented the Lord Admiral of the United Kingdom. In English legal theory, the Lord Admiral, as vice-regal of the monarch, was the only person who had authority over matters relating to the sea.Jordan The Lord Admiral would authorize others as his deputies or surrogates to act. Generally, he would appoint a person as a judge to sit in the Court as his surrogate. By appointing Vice-Admirals in the colonies, and by constituting courts as Vice-Admiralty Courts, the terminology recognized that the existence and superiority of the ‚Äúmother‚Äù court in the United Kingdom. Thus, the ‚Äúvice‚Äù tag denoted that whilst it was a separate court, it was not equal to the ‚Äúmother‚Äù court. In the case of the New South Wales court, a right of appeal lay back to the British Admiralty Court, which further reinforced this superiority. In all respects, the court was an Imperial court rather than a local Colonial court. The function of an admiralty court initially in the 14th century was to deal with piracy and other offenses committed upon the high seas. This was a manifestation of England's claim over the sovereignty of the seas claimed by her. However, it did not take long for those early courts to seek to manifest control over all things to do with shipping, such as mercantile matters. This led to a running battle between the admiralty courts and the common law courts as to which court had jurisdiction over particular issues. At times King Richard II and King James I were induced to arbitrate a solution to these disputes. Admiralty courts were run under the Roman civil law of the time, whereas the common law courts were run under the common law procedures. Litigants would prefer the simplicity of the admiralty courts over the complexities of the common law courts. Establishment The court in New South Wales was established by letters patent dated 2 April 1787 issued by the reigning monarch of England, King George III. These letters authorized the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to constitute and appoint a Vice Admiral for the colony, as well as a Judge and any other officers needed for the court to function in the new colony that was soon to be established. The Admirals had authority to appoint vice-admirals and judges in any existing colony. However, as the colony of New South Wales was not yet established, the Admiralty obtained additional letters patent to ensure that there was no legal defect in the constitution of the court. Those further letters patent authorized the Admiralty to make appointments in the new colony.Bennett On 30 April 1787, the High Court of Admiralty issued those letters patent which appointed the first Governor of New South Wales Arthur Phillip as Vice Admiral. Further letters patent were also issued to Robert Ross who was appointed as the first judge of the court. Arthur Phillip, first Vice-Admiral of New South Wales Their commissions gave them power to deal with all civil and maritime causes according to the maritime laws and customs which prevailed in what used to be called the High Court of Admiralty in the United Kingdom.ALRC report At the time of establishment, this included commercial disputes involving ships, seamen's wages, collisions, and salvage. This is what is commonly called an Admiralty Court's ‚ÄúInstance Jurisdiction.‚Äù Whilst the British admiralty court had jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed upon the high seas, the jurisdiction of the court was rarely invoked. The civil law was well suited to dealing with commercial transactions. However, it could not cope adequately with criminal offenses. The court needed to rely upon the old Roman civil law to establish any breaches.See In re Piracy Jure Gentium, [1934] AC 586, 589 Former Chief Justice Frederick Jordan noted that criminal cases often fell through because sailors weren‚Äôt available to give evidence (whether by malice or design). A sentence of death could only not be imposed unless two witnesses could be produced. To deal with this problem, the British Parliament passed the Piracy Act 1698 (UK). This enabled the Crown to appoint seven commissioners to try offenses of piracy under that Act. Whilst that latter court was often called a vice-admiralty court, Australian legal historian John Bennett has shown that that court should not be confused with the present court. The latter court was legally distinct as it was constituted under a separate letters patent dated 12 May 1787 as the Court of Vice-Admiralty and it was constituted by commissioners rather than a judge. The court sat as a Prize Court, although Bennett points out that there are no records of a prize commission being granted.Bennett p155 The first sitting in Prize was in May 1799 when Captain Henry Waterhouse RN ordered the Spanish vessel Nostra Senora de Bethlehem .condemned as a prize of war. Other Spanish vessels condemned during this time were the El Plumier, Euphemia and the Anna Josepha In 1810 Judge Advocate Ellis Bent questioned the jurisdiction of the court to consider proceedings in prize. As a result, the Admiralty issued warrants and documents to Bent in June 1812 to authorize the court to consider prize, but subsequently revoked Bent's authority in October 1813. As a result, The Eringapatam was unable to be dealt with in New South Wales in 1814 when it was brought into portBennett p156 Work of the court before 1840 The first sitting of the court purported to be in 1798 when Governor Hunter convened the latter court to deal with charges of mutiny and attempted piracy. As Bennett has shown, whilst the court was convened as a vice-admiralty court, it was in fact the Court of Vice-Admiralty. No harm was done as the defendant was acquitted on the basis of insufficient evidence. The majority of the work of the court was administrative in nature. Archive records from the court indicate that this related to the granting and revoking of letters of marque and the provision of sureties by masters or shipowners. After the death of Ellis Bent, deputy judge advocate of the colony and also judge of this court, his brother Jeffery Hart Bent, offered to serve as judge. Jeffery Bent was the judge of the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature. His offer was declined by Governor Hunter and he was never commissioned. However, when he left New South Wales after his appointment as judge of the Supreme Court was revoked, he took the Admiralty court seal entrusted to his brother Ellis with him back to the United Kingdom. Castles says that the removal of the seal was to cause litigants in the court to bitterly remember Bent. This was because that documents from the court could not be sealed until a new seal arrived from the United Kingdom, frustrating litigation in the court.Castles In 1823, the Third Charter of Justice created a new Supreme Court of New South Wales. That court was to be presided over by Chief Justice of New South Wales Francis Forbes. However, the British authorities did not transfer the admiralty jurisdiction of the vice admiralty court to that new court. Until 1911, this court and the new Supreme Court operated side by side. In some cases, both courts had concurrent jurisdiction, such as over criminal offenses committed upon the high seas. However, in practice, criminal cases were brought in the Supreme Court probably because of the difficulty in finding seven commissioners to sit. In practice, the senior judge of the Supreme Court was also appointed as a judge of the vice-admiralty court. This could cause problems as when the judge was unavailable through leave or absence, there was a belief that no other person who could perform the role. For example, in the case of the Almorah, the Attorney General of New South Wales Saxe Bannister thought that there was no actual admiralty court as Forbes did not hold an actual commission from the United Kingdom as a judge in Admiralty. Bannister advised that the case should be tried in Calcutta, India. In 1841, the Admiralty in England decreed that the chief justice should be the judge in admiralty. This changed the previous practice of directing appointing a person to be judge.Ying p241 However, under Chief Justice Alfred Stephen, the vice- admiralty commission was given to Justice Samuel Milford instead. Milford regularly sat in the court at least one day a week. However, when Milford was appointed the Resident Judge at Moreton Bay (being the precursor of the Supreme Court of Queensland, Stephen offered to resign his commission as judge in vice-admiralty. The British authorities declined that request and advised that if Stephen was to resign his admiralty commission, by necessity, he would have to resign his commission as chief justice of the Supreme Court. Work of the court after 1840 The jurisdiction of the British court of admiralty was extended in both 1840 and in 1861 by the Admiralty Court Acts of 1840 and 1861. That increase in jurisdiction did not flow down to the New South Wales court. The British Parliament passed the Vice Admiralty Courts Act 1863 (UK) to confirm the colonial jurisdiction of the courts as well as giving them jurisdiction over ships mortgages, disputes over ownership or possession of ships, employment, the earnings of any registered ship, claims for master's wages, towage and building or repairing ships. The Act provided for an appeal to the Privy Council and also allowed the judge of the court to appoint a registrar or marshal locally, rather than wait on an appointment from the United Kingdom. However, these changes did not make the court a local court, and the court was still an Imperial Court of the United Kingdom.ALRC In 1868, the Victorian registered schooner Daphne chartered by Ross Lewin and skippered by John Daggett recruited islanders from the islands of Tanna, Erromango, Efate, Loyalty and Banks as indentured labour for employment on Queensland sugarcane fields. This was under Queensland's Polynesian Labourers Act.Polynesian Labourer's Act 1868 (Qld) That Act required a ship to have a license to undertake that work. The license required the vessel to uphold certain minimum conditions as to the state and fitness of the vessel to carry labourers. The license for the Daphne was for a maximum of 58 labourers that could be conveyed to Queensland on each voyage. At this some point during a second voyage to Queensland, it was decided to sail to the island of Fiji where the recruiters could obtain six pounds Sterling for each of the 108 islanders, rather than nine pounds Sterling for the 58 islanders which they were permitted to carry to Queensland. The licence was in Lewin's name but he remained on the island of Tanna. The Daphne sailed on to Levuka where it was intercepted by HMS Rosario on patrol from Sydney. The ship's captain George Palmer suspected that the Daphne was a slaver ship, detained it, and conveyed it to Sydney. Palmer brought proceedings in the court to have the Daphne condemned under the British slave trade laws. An earlier magistrate's committal hearing for the crime of piracy was dismissed. The case was heard by Sir Alfred Stephen, who was the Chief Justice of New South Wales, and held the appointment of judge commissary in the Vice-Admiralty Court. Stephen dismissed the case on 24 September on the basis that the British Slave Trade Act 1839 did not apply to the South Pacific Ocean 1890 1890 saw the enactment of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 (UK). That Act provided for the abolition of the Imperial Courts of Admiralty and replace them with local courts to be called Colonial Courts of Admiralty. It was widely considered unsatisfactory that the Imperial court should exist separately to the colonial courts, yet use the same facilities and personnel of the colonial courts. Every superior court not named in that Act would become a Colonial Court of Admiralty automatically. The Act commenced operation on 1 July 1891, but it did not apply to either this Court or the Victorian equivalent, as the Act named those courts as exclusions. This was apparently due to local concerns. The act was to fix the court's jurisdiction as at 1891. This Act was to remain the main source of jurisdiction for Australian Courts to act under for Admiralty work until the passing of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Comm) in 1988.Court Forms Precedents & Pleadings ‚Äì NSW, LexisNexis In 1899 the court heard the case of the Glencairn. In this case, the Glencairn was being towed to Newcastle, New South Wales during a gale and heavy seas. The tugboat which was towing it lost its towline to the Glencairn. Another tugboat belonging to another owner rescued it and brought her in safely. The presiding judge awarded the owners ¬£125 for the rescue, ¬£100 to the master of the boat for his promptitude and skill, and ¬£75 to the crew to be divided equally amongst them.The ‚ÄúGlencairn‚Äù (1899) 15 WN (NSW) 166 cited in J Fenwick & Co Pty Ltd V The ‚ÄúGoldean Falcon‚Äù Her Cargo Freight and Bunkers - (1990) 24 NSWLR 611 at 620 , Appeals There was a right of appeal to the High Court of Admiralty in England.Justice Gummow, Federal Court of Australia, Empire Shipping Co Inc v Owners of the Ship ‚ÄúShin Kobe Maru‚Äù - 104 ALR 489 at page 516 This was in contrast to the earliest civil courts in New South Wales, being the Court of Civil Jurisdiction, the Governors Court and the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature. Each of those courts either had no right of appeal, or instead, had a right of appeal to the Governor sitting as a Court of Appeal. Abolition The court was abolished when the court's jurisdiction was finally given to the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 4 May 1911 through an order made by the British Privy Council. This order was made under the previous Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act 1890 (UK). From that time on, the Supreme Court was the Colonial Court of Admiralty and exercised the jurisdiction of that court. References Sources *Jordan, Frederick, ‚ÄúSelect legal papers.

The colliery, sunk by the Lothian Coal Company in 1890, came into production in 1894. It was nationalised in 1947 with the formation of the National Coal Board, and had closed in 1981. Buildings The buildings were recognised as being of outstanding interest as they formed an almost complete survival of a major Victorian colliery, with later additions. Some demolition, such as the 1950s canteen and medical centre, has occurred but the vast bulk of the structures stand. The winding engine is by Grant, Ritchie and Company and the colliery headstocks were built by Arrols of Glasgow. From 1998 onwards several of the main structures were stabilised and new visitor facilities opened. Collections The Museum developed collections, such as a library, and exhibitions that were housed in a visitor centre which has previously formed part of the colliery offices. The Prestongrange beam engine, a Cornish engine, at Prestonpans, East Lothian, also for a time formed part of the Museum until responsibility for it passed to East Lothian Council [date needed].

He was ordained as the MathƒÅdhipati in 1720 and served as the head till his death in 1757. He was the shishya (disciple) of Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram I. Swami Shankarashram was responsible for the establishment of the Chitrapur Math at Shirali which is now the head matha of the SƒÅraswats. Under his reign, the matha got many land grants from the King of Nagar. There are many stories where Swami ShankarƒÅshram is said to have performed miracles (See Miracles) for his devotees in their times of need. So devotees from different parts of Karnataka and beyond came to be his followers. He died in 1757 at Shirali. His samƒÅdhi (shrine) is located inside the Chitrapur Math at ShirƒÅli. He was succeeded by Swami Parijnanashram II as the MathƒÅdhipati in the same year.  PattƒÅbhisheka (Crowning Ceremony)  ShankarƒÅshram was the son of Krishnayya Kulkarni of the Shukla Bhat family before he was chosen as the shishya of Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram, the first MathƒÅdhipati and guru of the SƒÅraswats. He belonged to the Kaundinya GotraClan of people belonging to the same lineage as the great Indian rishi Kaundinya. ShankarƒÅshram I was ordained as the second Guru of the SƒÅraswats after the MahƒÅ-samadhi of his guru, Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram (On Krishna Chaturdashi day of the month of Chaitra in 1720). The ceremony was held at the Bhandikere Matha in Gokarn(See ƒÄdi matha). He had been under Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram for only 14 days after which Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram diƒÑed. At the time of Swami ShankarƒÅshram ordination as the new MathƒÅdhipati, his devotees gave a solemn promise in writing, that they would be faithful to him and would always follow his religious observances. The Swami's family henceforth was known as Shuklabhat ().Shukla means \\"bright\\" or \\"new\\" in Sanskrit and Bhat is a generic surname for scholars. So Shuklabhat means \\"New scholars\\". (NOTE:Henceforth in this article, Swamiji will refer to Swami ShankarƒÅshram I  Expansion of Matha  During the reign of Swami ShankarƒÅshram, the community and the matha received land grants from the King of Nagar. In 1739, BƒÅsappa Nayak II of Nagar made land grants to the Math by a gift deed. This helped in the development of the infrastructure of the matha. Swami ShankarƒÅshram was able to persuade several people from stopping their Vaishnavite customs and converted them to the Advaita Shaivism practised by the community.  Miracles  Swamiji is attributed to many miracles which he is said to have performed for his highly devout followers when they were faced with difficulties. Two of them are listed below. = Brahmin from Bankikodla = Once there lived a Brahmin in the village of Bankikodla who was pious and devout. Every morning after finishing his pooja (prayers and offerings to the Lord), he would stand on the streets and try to find a hungry beggar. He would offer that needy person his hospitality and serve that person good meal. He did this out of true concern for the people in need in his village. He had this desire of serving Swamiji but could not travel all the way to Gokarn to meet him. One day he happened to see a sanyƒÅsi clad in saffron robes walking down his street. When the sanyƒÅsi came closer, the Brahmin discovered that it was none other than Swami ShankarƒÅshram. With great reverence he led Swamiji to his house and fed him a simple meal that his wife had prepared. After the meal, when Swamiji was resting, the Brahmin left his house for an errand. When he came back he saw that the swami had left. He was utterly disappointed that he could not see the swami off. Some time later he called on the matha only to find that the swami had never left the matha at all that morning. So when the Brahmin next met Swami ShankarƒÅshram, with teary eyes he fell at Swamiji's feet and thanked him for having fulfilled his ultimate desire. = Artist from Gokarn = Once there was an artist who lived in the town of Gokarn. He was a pious Brahmin who found it difficult to make ends meet since his paintings were not selling. He had an ardent desire to serve Swamiji at his home, but he could not afford it. One night, both he and his wife had a dream where Swamiji assured them his grace. They were startled since both of them had had the same dream. So the next day they prepared a simple meal with much love and devotion anticipating the arrival of Swamiji. As the dream had proclaimed, Swamiji came to their home. He graciously accepted their bhikshƒÅ (meal) and a meagre amount of four AnnƒÅsFormer currency unit in India. 1 annƒÅ =1/16 of 1 Indian Rupee 4 annƒÅs = 25 paisekƒÅnika (monetary offering). He blessed the couple and left for the matha. Within a few days after Swamiji's visit, the artist received a huge assignment from a wealthy family for a portrait. The patron was very pleased by the work and rewarded the artist handsomely with a princely sum of Rupees One Thousand. The artist recognized this as the result of the blessings from Swamiji. He immediately rushed to Swamiji and placed the entire amount at his feet. Swamiji accepted a small portion of the money and gave back the rest and asked him to pursue his work with full devotion. The swamiji promised him that the grace of the Lord was always with him. Things were never the same for the artist. His services were hired by many a patron who rewarded him generously for his works. This story is a popular tale among the people of the SƒÅraswat community.  Fall-out with residents of Bhatkal  Even though the devotion of many people grew, not everybody \\"believed\\" in the divine grace of Swami ShankarƒÅshram. The residents of the town of Bhatkal were among those who chose not to have faith in the Swamiji. Once Swamiji travelled to Bhatkal to offer spiritual discourses to the residents there. It so happened that rumours about the Swamiji being a fake spread rapidly. So on the given day nobody was there to welcome him and perform GurusƒìvƒÅ (Service to the Guru). This misunderstanding resulted in the Bhatkal clan being distanced from the Swamiji's followers.  Chitrapur Math  After the \\"no-show\\" at Bhatkal (See above section) Swami ShankarƒÅshram was deeply hurt. He decided to return to Gokarn. On the way back, at the village of Shirali, the devotees pleaded to Swamiji to stay there for sometime and to bless the people with his presence. The swamiji consented and he stayed at the residence of the NƒÅgarkattƒì family. The NƒÅgarkattƒì family later donated their residence in honour of the Swamiji, after his death. This became the ChitrƒÅpur Matha, the head matha of the community.  Death  During his stay at ShirƒÅli as the honoured guest of the NƒÅgarkattƒì family, Swami ShakarƒÅshram's health failed rapidly. To the dismay of his devotees, his health took a turn for the worse and Swamiji became terminally ill. \\"My children, the grace of Lord BhavƒÅnishankara will always protect you. Follow all that has been taught without fear\\" (-Translated from Konkani to Sanskrit). With these words, Swami ShankarƒÅshram died on the 6th day of the month of Ashwina in 1757. Swamiji's untimely death meant that he could not accept a shishya(disciple). This resulted in the community not having a guru to succeed Swami ShankarƒÅshram. His samadhi is located in Shirali and is also called the Hodi SamƒÅdhi ('Big SamƒÅdhi' in Konkani).

The work was a tent with the appliqu√©d names of, literally, everyone she had ever slept with, but not necessarily in the sexual sense. It achieved iconic status, was owned by Charles Saatchi, and was destroyed in the 2004 Momart London warehouse fire. She has refused to re-create it.

Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963‚Äì1995 was a tent appliqu√©d with 102 names of the people she had slept with up to the time of its creation in 1995. The title is often misinterpreted as a euphemism indicating sexual partners and the work termed \\"a list of all the people that Emin has ever had sex with\\", but is in fact intended more inclusively: Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963‚Äì1995 by Tracey Emin (1995). An interior view of the work. The names include family, friends, drinking partners, lovers and even two numbered foetuses. The name of former boyfriend, Billy Childish, could be seen prominently through the tent opening. The tent was square and coloured blue; its shape was reminiscent of the Margate Shell Grotto, with which Emin was very familiar from childhood; inside on the floor of the tent was the text, \\"With myself, always myself, never forgetting\\".Brown, p.84. The work was created during a relationship she had in the mid-1990s with Carl Freedman, who had been an early friend of, and collaborator with, Damien Hirst and who had co-curated seminal Britart shows, such as Modern Medicine and Gambler. In 1995, Freedman curated the show Minky Manky at the South London Gallery, where the tent was first shown. At that time Emin had not achieved the level of fame which she was to later, and was mainly known in art circles; she was fortunate to be able to exhibit alongside much better-known artists such as Damien Hirst, Gilbert and George and Sarah Lucas. Emin described the genesis of the work, which turned out unexpectedly to be the highlight of the show: At that time Emin refused to sell work directly to Charles Saatchi because she disapproved of his advertising work for Margaret Thatcher, whom she accused of \\"crimes against humanity\\".Gleadell. Instead Saatchi bought it on the secondary market from a private dealer, Eric Franck, at a premium price of ¬£40,000 ‚Äì Emin had sold it originally for ¬£12,000. She reconciled with Saatchi in 1999.SHOWstudio Art world gossip in 2001 was that Saatchi had been offered ¬£300,000 for it; Emin's comment on this was, \\"He won't re-sell, but the art is his. He can do what he likes with it.\\" Saatchi exhibited the tent in the 1997 Sensation exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London; public outrage was centred on Marcus Harvey's portrait of Myra Hindley and, at the later staging of the exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, on Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary with collaged pornographic images.Barnes. =Momart fire= In 2004, the tent was destroyed in a fire at the East London Momart warehouse, along with two of Emin's other works and some 100 more from Saatchi's collection, including works by Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Martin Maloney.BBC: \\"Fire devastates Saatchi artworks.

Tabloid papers, The Sun and the Daily Mail, both stated they had already created their own replacement tents, and the latter's Godfrey Barker asked, \\"Didn't millions cheer as this 'rubbish' went up in flames?\\" The same implication gained applause on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions?; Hugo Rifkind in The Times thought similarly to The Independent's Tom Lubbock, who wrote: > \\"It's odd to hear talk about irreplaceable losses.

She was, though, upset at the public reaction to the fire, pointing both to lack of cultural understanding ‚Äì \\"The majority of the British public have no regard or no respect to what me and my peers do, to the point that they laugh at a disaster like a fire.\\" ‚Äì and to lack of compassion ‚Äì \\"It is just not fair and it's not funny and it's not polite and it's bad manners. I would never laugh at a disaster like that ‚Äì I just have some empathy and sympathy with people's loss.\\" She also stated that she could not remake the tent, because \\"I had the inclination and inspiration 10 years ago to make that, I don't have that inspiration and inclination now ... My work is very personal, which people know, so I can't create that emotion again ‚Äì it's impossible.\\" At her 2008 Edinburgh retrospective show, she said that after the fire she had been offered ¬£1 million (the amount of the insurance payment) by the Saatchi Gallery to remake the tent, but that, although she had recreated some small pieces for the retrospective, to have remade the tent \\"would just be silly\\". In May 2009, Dinos Chapman said that he and his brother Jake recreated the tent. Both Emin and the Chapmans are represented by White Cube gallery in London. In The Independent, Jerome Taylor questioned whether this was a publicity stunt.Taylor. =Burn Baby Burn= In collaboration with Uri Geller, artist Stuart Semple collected remains from the Momart fire site and packaged them in 8 plastic boxes under the title Burn Baby Burn; the boxes had slogans in pink lettering, including \\"RIP YBA\\" which referred to the Young British Artists amongst whom Emin is classified.Edwardes. Semple stated that among the debris collected there were fragments of Emin's tent. The assemblage was offered to, but rejected by, the Tate gallery.

The festival was originally titled Hugs and Chugs Fest and was booked by Art Henke. Art created bootleg videos of the show and the bands sold them at their shows, which helped build hype for the following year. The name change was inspired by Forever is Forgotten's song, Destroying a Lifetime of Innocence, which sounded like two robots fighting. This song led Art Henke and Robot Mosh Fest flyer artist, Michael Adler, to create Robot outfits and fight during a show, which in turn led to Robot Mosh Fest. Art went on to book Robot Mosh Fest 2002. CDRs packaged in DVD cases with full art were used as successful promotional flyers and would become a staple for each year's festival. Andy Parmann filmed the show and created bootleg videos for the bands to sell, which helped build hype for the following year. Unfortunately Robot Mosh Fest 2003 never happened. Art passed the Robot Mosh Fest torch to Andy Parmann who proceeded to book the next two festivals (2004-2005), each gaining more exposure, larger acts and crowds. In 2006, Andy was joined by Steve Roche who helped co-organize the following three years of the festival (2006-2008), which included breaking the festival into two days, elevating it to National attention. In 2007, Fox news covered the event and interviewed show-goers. Andy, Michael and Art ran a website (www.didntthathurt.com) dedicated to documenting metal and hardcore music in Milwaukee, WI. The site was the hub of Milwaukee's underground metal and hardcore scene during the festivals lifespan. It even crashed a few times due to bandwidth overloads from the interest of the festival.

He served as the interim rector of the Universidad Aut√≥noma de la Ciudad de M√©xico from 2013 to 2014. Biography Enrique Dussel was born on December 24, 1934 in La Paz, Argentina.Burton, Mark; Osorio, Jorge Mario Flores (2011-01-01). \\"Introducing Dussel: the philosophy of liberation and a really social psychology\\". Psychology in Society (41): 20‚Äì39. ISSN 1015-6046.Dussel, Enrique. \\"HOME - Enrique Dussel-Philosopher\\". enriquedussel.com. He studied at the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza from 1953 to 1957, receiving an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, after which he travelled to Europe to continue his studies. He then received a Doctorate from the Complutense University of Madrid, a Doctorate in History from the Sorbonne in Paris, and an undergraduate degree in Theology obtained through studies in Paris and M√ºnster. Between 1959 and 1961 he lived in Israel learning Arabic and Hebrew and working manual jobs at a cooperative led by French Jesuit Paul Gauthier. He returned to Argentina in 1969 and became influenced by Dependency Theory and the writings of Emmanuel Levinas, both of which were to become major influences on his thinking. In the events leading up to the military dictatorship in Argentina of 1976-1983, he was increasingly the target of violence, including death threats, the bombing of his house, and sacking from the university. He escaped to Mexico in 1975 as a political exile, where he continued his work as a Professor of Philosophy at the Iztapalapa campus of the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana (Autonomous Metropolitan University, UAM) and in a teaching position at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (National Autonomous University of Mexico, UNAM). Dussel received an honorary doctorate from the University of Fribourg in 1981, the University of San Andr√©s in 1995, the University of Buenos Aires in 2012, the Universidad Santo Tom√°s in 2015, the National University of San Mart√≠n in 2015, and the University of Chile in 2017. He has produced an expansive body of work numbering some forty books on a range of subjects including the philosophy of liberation, ethics, political economy, theology, history and modernity/postmodernity. Much of his work is so far only limitedly available in English, and some contend that his work has not received the broader attention it warrants. Additionally, he has been visiting professor for one semester at Frankfurt University, Notre Dame University, California State University, Los Angeles, Union Theological Seminary (New York), Loyola University Chicago, Vanderbilt University, Duke University, Harvard University, and others. In March 2013 he was named the interim rector of the Autonomous University of Mexico City for a period of one year. Dussel has maintained dialogue with philosophers such as Karl-Otto Apel, Gianni Vattimo, J√ºrgen Habermas, Richard Rorty and Emmanuel L√©vinas Mendieta, Eduardo (1993), \\"Editor's Introduction\\" to The Underside of Modernity (online version) Author of more than 50 books, his thoughts cover many themes including: theology, politics, philosophy, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and ontology. He has been a critic of postmodernity, preferring instead the term \\"transmodernity.\\" Philosophy of liberation Enrique Dussel is one of the primary figures along with others such as Rodolfo Kusch, Arturo Roig, and Leopoldo Zea, in the philosophical movement referred to as the Philosophy of Liberation.Mendieta, Eduardo (2016-01-01). Zalta, Edward N., ed. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 ed.). Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University. The philosophical content is heterogenous but arises from and responds to the particular historical/socio-political context of Latin America as part of a global periphery (see Dependency Theory). The movement originated in Argentina in the early 1970s but during the period of military dictatorship it dispersed across Latin America as many intellectuals were forced into exile. Subsequently, the Philosophy of Liberation has been highly influential both in Latin America and beyond. The philosophy of liberation seeks to critique structures of colonialism, imperialism, globalization, racism, and sexism, from the particular experience of exploitation and alienation of the global periphery. It poses a direct challenge to the discourses of Euro-American philosophy, and emphasizes the socio-political responsibilities of Latin American philosophy towards the project of historical liberation. Philosophy of history This work consists of edited versions of six lectures given by Dussel in 1972. Intended to sketch ideas later developed in a second volume entitled Ethics and the Theology of Liberation, the text gives a wide-ranging account, focused on the history of the church and its role in Latin America, with the overarching goal of elaborating a distinctly Latin American Theology, centered around a liberatory politics. Dussel is concerned primarily with history, particularly in constructing a sense of the history of Latin America, and a sense of participation in a historical process towards liberation. His account reaches back to human origins, and includes topics ranging from Aztec and Inca belief systems and worldviews to the origins of Christianity, to the Byzantine Empire, to the role of the church in Spanish conquest. The second half of the book covers the 20th century, addressing the political upheavals of the 1960s, the violence and oppression endured under military regimes, the response of the church, and the question of violent and non-violent resistance in Christian thinking. Dussel also explores the compatibility of socialism with Christian doctrine, and the possibility of a uniquely Latin American socialism. The single thread which runs most prominently through each section is the question of resistance to oppression. Dussel explores through exegesis the Christian obligation to overcome the sin of oppression through commitment to selfless action towards the goal of historical liberation.

Another reason for Tulsi Comics failure was that they produced story arcs in a minimum of 2‚Äì3 parts, and they never usually gave a complete story in a single issue. Since most of the comic readers in India are children who had limited pocket money, this practice ultimately backfired, and it lost popularity among its reader base. Chief among these was a huge story arc of Jambu spanning several comics lasting for more than a year. Though this whole series was among the best Tulsi has ever offered creatively, this long continuing series, along with introducing a lot of new characters like Yosho who was blessing of God sun (formerly advertised as Osho), Yoga, Baaz and Mr. India led to its death. The new characters were just not as exciting and older characters were multi-part stories. Tulsi comics character \\"Jambu\\" was their most successful character, created by a Ved Prakash Sharma, followed by Angara and Tausi.  Frequency  Tulsi Comics were published monthly. The number of comics published every month varied from 6 to 10 (sometimes 1 or 2 digest are also published as special issues.) Angara, Tausi and Jambu were the three main heroes of this publication. Some of the famous comics are Jambu aur Angara ka Yudh,http://indiancomicology.blogspot.com/2014/12/jambu-aur-angara-ka- yuddh.html Jambu aur Tausi, Mar Gaya Jambu,http://indiancomicology.blogspot.com/2014/11/jambu-mar-gaya-jambu.html and Jambu ke Bete.http://indiancomicology.blogspot.com/2014/09/jambu-ke- bete.html  Head Office  The Head Office of the Tulsi Pocket Books is - :Tulsi Pocket Books :Delhi Road :Meerut - 250 002 :Contact Number - +91-999-7023-070  Characters  * Angara - a super-intelligent being created from a gorilla, a fox, an elephant, a rhino, a vulture and a lion * Tausi - a shape-shifting snake. He is the king of Naaglok (land of snakes which reside in human form) which is in Patal lok which is said to be below our earth. He time to time visits the current earth also. * Jambu - a super genius robot, fitted with the brain of its creator scientist Dr. Bhawa. He was the most popular superhero of Tulsi Comics. * Yosho - A fiery superhero, who comes to earth in search of his father. * Yoga - A common man who through his Yogic powers becomes a superhero. * Baaz - a common man who looks identical to prince of ghosts(prets) and gets the prince's costume to have super powers which helps him in fighting crime. * Mr India - a superhero having support of spirits of 5 scientists who act as his super powers. * Shalu-Kalu - a funny boy girl pair. This is the only series in Tulsi Comics which is humour based. * Detective Bharat - a detective who solves cases along with his friend Magician Goglapasha. In his very first comics, he saves Magician Goglapasha.http://indiancomicology.blogspot.in/2014/08/bharat-dhuen-ka- aadmi.html * Mahabali Aakash/Major Rajesh - a masked crime fighter. * Other than the regular characters - Tulsi Comics published comics based on Kings- Queens, Princes-Princesses, Demons-Dragons-Ghosts and moral values. They also published some Bollywood Film stories in form of comics. Due to the lack of original characters, more than half of the total comics published by the company fall in this broad category.  Angara  Angara, a man made of animal body parts,http://indiancomicology.blogspot.in/2015/05/angara.html was created by Dr Kunal. Angara's rhino skin made him bullet-proof, and his brain from the fox gave him extraordinary intelligence, eyes was made up of vulture's eyes, he has the power taken from elephant, heart of the lion, and body of gorilla which made him look like a human. He has special commando training taken from experts and he knows the language of every animal. Dr Kunal helped him to achieve all these qualities which makes him a Super hero. He was born to save animals and became known as a saviour of wild life. He was a Prime Minister of Angara land (or Angara Dweep). When Angara land was under the control of the American army, animal life was almost finished. The Americans wanted to plant an army base in Angara land but Dr Kunal, a great lover and a saviour of animals, tried to reason with the Americans to no avail. The US army killed almost all the wild life in Angara land. Dr Kunal, who was also a surgeon, decided to create a powerful creature to fight the Americans' powerful army and that's how Angara was born. Members of the Angara land ministry includes: * Angad (chimp) - as President * Sujuki - the Army Chief or Senapati * Chilli - Defence Minister * Jamwant (bear) - Law Minister * Sher Singh (lion) - Home Minister * Gajraj (elephant) - Food Minister * Kastoori Hirini (deer) - Finance Minister * Khargoshi (rabbit) - Education Minister * Jatayu * Whale Rani * Abu - the Spy * Banu * Seekhu Tota (parrot) and many more.

He becomes their ruler by killing the native race's King by beating him in a duel. Later stories explored his improving relations with native race, rebuilding their society and saving them from attacks. Slowly, he discovers his doppelganger by the name of \\"Shanichar\\". He also finds out that in previous life he was tortured and killed by him and so when he was created, Shanichar's image and powers were in the sub-conscious mind of the professor whose brain he carries now. Both of them had the final showdown with Jambu killing him with the planet's water (which has acidic properties and only the protection against it is a special element from the native planet). Instead of finishing the story arc, they continued the series by introducing \\"Sarkata\\". He finds the head who tells him that his body has liquid which can cure all diseases and grant immortality. He also tells a fake story to gain Jambu's sympathy. The quest begins to find his whole body as the liquid can only be extracted if the whole body is brought together. After a lot of struggle he finally brings whole of his body together and brings him back to India in order to extract the Miracle Liquid called \\"Amrit\\".

Most of the undergraduates will spend their entire four college years on this campus, with few exceptions like those who are admitted into the SILC. The Baoshan Campus is the most recently built campus of SHU, and the east district of which is still under construction. There are two libraries on this campus. The iconic Main Library, and Qianweichang Library built in the remembrance of the late and former president of the university, Weichang Chien. A half-circular lake named Panchi (Ê≥ÆÊ±†, lit. \\"half-a-lake\\") is at the center of this campus. The name of the lake is given to honor Confucius. According to the Rites of Zhou, Panchis are built at the palaces of the feudal kings. As Confucius was bestowed the title of King Wenxuan in Tang Dynasty, a Panchi was built at every Temple of Confucius. Later, Panchis lost their original meaning as \\"lakes built for the kings\\", but became an icon for Confucius, Chinese academia and scholars. And the school entrance ceremony for all the newly admitted students are called \\"Rupan\\" (lit. \\"entering the Panchi\\").

History It was founded by Pius XI at the conclusion of the extraordinary Jubilee of Redemption, when the Central Committee, set up that same Holy Year 1933‚Äì1934 to assist all pilgrims to Rome, was established as a permanent Office. Pope Paul VI erected it a Canonical Body in 1972; the reorganisation in 1977 confirmed the spiritual initiatives born during the Holy Year 1975. On 16 January 1997 John Paul II granted it new Statutes which emphasized its pastoral characteristics and specified its purpose and nature: *help particular Churches in order to promote the spiritual and material assistance to pilgrims visiting Peter's See, whether groups or individuals, who have come for a pious visit, especially for ecclesial events promoted by the Holy See. * implement the provisions of the Central Committee during the Holy Years in order to ensure the appropriate reception of pilgrims traveling from Dioceses located throughout the world to Rome, in response to the appeals of the National and Diocesan Committees encouraging pilgrimages to Rome. * assist and coordinate the flow of pilgrims directed to the various world Sanctuaries to participate in religious events led by the Pope. * encourage the participation of the most needy to the above-mentioned pilgrimages. Organization The Board of Directors endorses annual programs and balance sheets and expresses its opinion on major issues. The Pastoral Council, whose members are multinational and multilingual Pastoral workers, is in charge of issues concerning the spiritual activity of the pilgrims in order to fulfill the religious goals of the Peregrinatio. The Pope appoints the President of the Peregrinatio, usually an archbishop or a cardinal. The Peregrinatio appoints its Delegates in different parts of the world, in agreement with the Ecclesiastic Authorities of the local Churches. P.A.P.S. organizes guided tours for groups of pilgrims inside Vatican City and around Christian Rome, especially to the Vatican Museums, Vatican Gardens, Catacombs of Rome and Papal basilicas, Liturgical Celebrations and Audiences with the Pope. It organizes Congresses (on demand), Masses, prayer gatherings and services with full assistance during Beatifications and Canonizations. It works primarily with religious institutions and houses which accommodate pilgrims as well as commercial hotels, restaurants and various other logistics, and offers air ticket services for employees of Vatican City, for the Departments and Offices of the Holy See and for all religious families.

The Sinks are on private property adjacent to Monongahela National Forest. Description The Sinks are a natural tunnel accommodating Gandy Creek, a tributary of Dry Fork, for about 3,000 feet (915 meters) as it passes under a spur of Yokum Knob to reemerge on the opposite side of Randolph County Route 40 (Dry Fork Road). The southern (upstream) entrance to the Sinks, about wide and high, is in a low ledge of limestone in a large depressed meadow. It consists of a simple longitudinal passage, from 4 to high, with a few minor side passages, not much apparent from the main passage. The main cave passage averages 40 to wide, but in some places up to wide. In some sections the stream occupies the entire floor of the passage, but in other sections it is confined to a narrow trench. The northern (downstream) entrance is offset about to the east of the stream channel, which exits under some boulders, making a second (wet) avenue of egress.Davies, William E.

Local settlers were certainly well aware of the Sinks by the 1830s. The earliest recorded reference to the Sinks may be a November 1833 letter sent by Randolph County physician Benjamin Dolbeare to the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society in Richmond. Dolbeare described several local caves including one as follows (with original spellings). \\"Between, what is here called, the Aleghany and Rich Mountains, heads a branch of the dry fork a tributary of Cheat River, a ridge extends itself quiet across, from one mountain to the other, and this branc[h], after keeping its course about 3 miles runs under this ridge which [is] about ¬æ of mile wide at its base, and very high.\\"Rachal, William M. E., editor, \\"Early Records of the Virginia Historical Society, 1831-1833\\" in Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, January 1959; v. 67, pp 25-26. (Cited in Taylor, John Craft, \\"The Early History of Pendleton County [sic] Caves, 1760 to 1860\\", pp 42-59 in Dasher, George R. (2001), Bulletin #15, The Caves and Karst of Pendleton County, West Virginia Speleological Survey; ). The Sinks were noted locally as the site of the last known killings of elk by hunters in what is now Randolph County, probably about 1830 and 1835. (The last elk killed in all of West Virginia were shot around 1843 in nearby Canaan Valley.) In March 1864, a minor incident of the Civil War occurred at the Sinks. Eight men of General Imboden's Confederate command, who had been waylaying wagon trains in the north, crossed into neighboring Tucker County where they robbed a general store about 3 miles from the town of Saint George. They were pursued by a Union captain and lieutenant who closed on them the next day at the Sinks. Three rebels were killed in the ensuing shootout, two captured and the stolen property recovered.Maxwell, Op. cit., pg 165 The Sinks first came to widespread public notice by way of a tongue-in-cheek account of a pleasure expedition to the region published by David Hunter Strother in Harper's Magazine in 1872 and 1873,Strother, David Hunter, \\"The Mountains\\", Harper's New Monthly Magazine, 45:358-361, 812, August 1872; and 46:669-675, 1873. although the visit upon which it is based probably occurred around 1854.Eby, Jr., Cecil D. (1960), \\"Porte Crayon\\": The Life of David Hunter Strother, University of North Carolina Press. This story, entitled \\"The Mountains\\", details the high jinx of a group of lively \\"Virginia gentlemen\\" who bumble through the then-virgin forest, annoying the sullen local \\"mountaineers\\", in search of the \\"tunnel of Gandy\\". This semi-fictionalized narrative treated the locals in rather xenophobic terms and recounted a lurid tale of cattle rustling, abduction and desperate escape in the cave and the surrounding area. The Sinks again became the object of a popularization effort when West Virginia writer Jack Preble published a series of articles and booklets about them between the 1940s and the 1960s. Preble's anecdotal and romanticizing approach was little more reliable than Strother's at giving an accurate account of the cave. It was also during this period that the West Virginia Highway Department began, with an eye toward the tourist potential, to replace the designation of \\"Osceola\\" with that of \\"The Sinks\\" on its official roadmaps.Preble, Jack, \\"Ibinthruthesinks Club\\", Pocahontas (W.Va.) Times, 19 Sept 1940 (Reprinted in Bulletin of the National Speleological Society, No. 3, pp 21-22).Preble, Jack, Land of Canaan: Plain Tales from the Mountains of West Virginia, Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Company, 1st ed., 1960; 2nd ed., 1965, 3rd ed., 1971, pp 61-92. Reprints the relevant portion of Strother's \\"The Mountains\\" from 1872-73.Preble, Jack, The Sinks of Gandy Creek, Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Company, 1969 (26 page booklet). The Sinks were first formally surveyed and mapped by members of the National Speleological Society on 1 September 1940 resulting in a figure of of passage.Medville, Douglas and Hazel E. Medville, compilers and editors, (1971), Bulletin #1, Caves of Randolph County, West Virginia Speleological Survey, pp 151-153 The cave was resurveyed in 1990 resulting in 5,058 additional feet for a total of of passage.Medville, Douglas M. and Hazel E. Medville, (1995), Bulletin #13, Caves and Karst of Randolph County, West Virginia Speleological Survey, pp 148-149. This makes the Sinks the 669th longest surveyed cave in the U.S. as of 10 March 2014National Speleological Society, Geo2 Committee on Long and Deep Caves Access Both entrances to the Sinks are located on private land. The upstream entrance is owned by the Teter family and the downstream exit is owned by the Tingler family.Owners noted by the West Virginia Highlands Conservatory (This same Teter family owned this land way back in 1854 when David Hunter Strother visited.) The location of the cave is not identified by any signage in the area. A parking lot on Dry Fork Road (County Route 40) for the Sinks is located at , with a trail to the upstream end starting nearby. The cave is relatively forgiving to inexperienced visitors. Because of its straightforward layout, most visitors can traverse it safely with simple household flashlights. A combination of scrambling and wading are required to pass some stretches, however, and many a visitor cannot locate the dry, downstream entrance (about back and to the right from the wet stream exit) and is therefore compelled to return the way he came in.

He led an army against the Tuscarora in 1711‚Äì1712. Later he served the colony as an official in talks with England in forming the government. He also worked to revive the relationship between the colony and its former allies the Yamasee. Life Barnwell's exact origins are uncertain. By the time the Tuscarora War began in 1712, Barnwell had become an important official of the colony. He led one army of colonial militia and allied Native Americans in campaigns. South Carolina sent two armies against the Tuscarora in North Carolina, the first of which Barnwell commanded in campaigns in late 1711 and early 1712. The army was made up mostly of Indians, especially Yamasee. Barnwell defeated the Tuscarora and arranged a peace treaty, after which his army disbanded. Hostilities between the Tuscarora and North Carolina resumed, and South Carolina sent a second army. North Carolina officials, blaming Barnwell for failing to destroy the Tuscarora, specifically requested another leader to command the second army. Barnwell was popularly known as \\"Tuscarora Jack\\" or \\"Tuscarora John\\" for his role in the war. In 1715 the Yamasee War broke out between colonists of South Carolina and the Yamasee and allied tribes. The Yamasee first attacked colonists near Port Royal. A survivor managed to flee to Port Royal Island, the main island, and sound the alarm. Barnwell and other colonists living on the island escaped by ship to Charles Town. When South Carolina overthrew the colonial proprietors and arranged to become a royal colony, John Barnwell travelled to London to represent the colony and help form the new government. After returning to South Carolina, he spent many years working for renewal of friendship with the Yamasee, who had migrated south to Spanish Florida. In 1721 Barnwell had a fortified outpost, named Fort King George, on the Altamaha River, in an attempt to check the Spanish influence on the region and its Indians. He was never able to achieve a renewal of the old Yamasee-British alliance. References * \\"John Barnwell.\\" Dictionary of American Biography Base Set.

Career He was knighted before 18 September 1439 and had a Safe-conduct to pass through England dated 23 April 1448, when he accompanied Lord Chancellor Crichton's Embassy to Flanders, France, and Burgundy. He served on a jury in a perambulation by Thomas de Cranstoun, Justiciar, on 22 March 1451, where he is styled \\"Sir George de Seton of that Ilk\\".

She had a short but fruitful popular music and jazz career in the late 1950s and early 1960s as an artist for Capitol Records.Bruyninckx, Walter. 60 years of recorded jazz 1917-1977, Volume 9, pp. R-229 Early life, musical education and influences Ann Richards was born Margaret Ann Borden on October 1, 1935, in San Diego, California, but raised to the north in Danville, California. Her father deserted the family early and the mothers maiden name of Richards was adopted. Her mother taught school and also wanted her daughter to become a teacher. Richards' mother gave her daughter piano lessons and the age of 15 also discovered she could sing. In nearby Oakland, Richards babysat for Judy Davis who was the later vocal coach of Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra. She tended after Davis's children in exchange for vocal lessons. Unbeknownst to her mother, late at night Richards would go out to sing in clubs getting experience in the bay area as a jazz and pop singer. Tour with Charlie Barnet and Hollywood Early in 1954 Richards moved into a young women's residence in San Francisco, she studied for 3 months at San Francisco State University to be a teacher. That same year band leader Charlie Barnet heard Richards at the El Patio Ballroom in San Francisco and hired her for a five-month tour as his band's primary female singer.Harris, Steven D. \\"The Kenton Kronicles: A Biography of Modern America's Man of Music, Stan Kenton\\" Dynaflow, 2003. pp. 131 Shortly after the tour with Barnett she moved to Hollywood. On Thanksgiving of 1954, Richards sang at the La Madelon restaurant on the Sunset Strip. Notable songwriters Joe Greene and Eddie Beal were in attendance that evening. The two were very impressed with her performance and booked her to do a record demo. Shortly after, Greene and Beal played the finished demo for Stan Kenton who they had numerous successful collaborations with (Pete Rugolo heard her also). Kenton got a hold of Richards and hired her as his new singer the day they met in his office on Robertson Blvd. Ann Richards recalled, \\"He (Stan) asked me one question: What do you want to do with your career? I said, 'Mr. Kenton, if I had a choice of singing with Guy Lombardo and making lots of money or making sixty bucks a week singing jazz , I'd rather spend the rest of my life singing jazz.' He said, 'Okay, you're hired.'\\" Much like when June Christy had started with Kenton 10 years early at 19 years of age, Richards was starting at this age with the Kenton organization in 1955 while coming in after singer Chris Connor (Connor left the band in 1953). Richards had long before aspired to being part of the Kenton musical legacy and fame.Friedwald, Will. A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers. Random House, Pantheon Books. 2010. pp. 697-698Easton, Carol. Straight Ahead: The Story of Stan Kenton. Morrow. 1973. pp. 182 Stan Kenton and Capitol Records Very shortly after joining the Kenton organization, Richards would record her first tracks with the orchestra on January 25, March 30 and May 15 (1955) at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.Sparke, Michael. Stan Kenton: The Studio Sessions Balboa Books. Lake Geneva. WI. 1998. pp. 111 and 113 The sessions were scheduled to highlight her as several pop style singles are produced from those dates to include An-Ting-A-Ling, Freddy/Winter In Madrid and The Handwriting's On The Wall. Her initial recordings never produced the hoped for hits Kenton was looking for at the time. The most notable and mature of these initial 1955 singles she records with Kenton come from a July 22, 1955, session. Richards sings two Bill Holman arrangements of the standards Black Coffee and The Thrill is Gone which are recorded at Universal Studios in Chicago. During that first summer with the Kenton organization she would make a notable July 26 appearance on the CBS summer television broadcast Music '55.YouTube, Ann Richards with the Stan Kenton Orchestra on Music 55 performing Falling Burt Korall of Metronome magazine heard the Stan Kenton Orchestra at Birdland in New York City and praised Richards as the band's new ‚Äúbig commercial asset,‚Äù noting her jazz feeling, intonation and star quality. By October 1955, DownBeat magazine named her the \\"best female band singer of the year.\\" Most of the 'romantic' time Richards had spend with Kenton initially was while they were touring, and not always to the approval of band. Kenton took Richards out on a first 'date' to Glenn Wallichs' house in Beverly Hills to view a television pilot of \\"Music '55\\" that sparked the romance with Richards and Kenton. Richards was married to Kenton shortly after on October 18, 1955, in Detroit.Sparke, Michael. \\"Stan Kenton: This is an Orchestra!\\" University of North Texas Press. pp. 127 Ironically, the two newlyweds would buy Wallichs' home at the time of their marriage to raise a family. Richards' appearance on any of Kenton's LP production releases for Capitol Records started with Kenton with Voices (1957) where she is a featured soloist on three tracks to include vocalese scatting on Gene Roland's Opus in Chartreuse. Shortly after the birth of the couple's two children, Richards was again regularly touring with the Kenton orchestra in the late 1950s (she had flown back early to the U.S. from U.K. tour due to stress during pregnancy). From February 7 to April 19, 1958, she performed on weekends with the Kenton at Balboa. During that time Kenton helped her secure a recording contract with Capitol Records. The record label supported her exclusively, featuring Richards on two high exposure releases backed by full studio orchestra. She was paired with conductor Brian Farnon and arranger Warren Barker for her debut album, I'm Shooting High (1958).Friedwald, Will. A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers. Random House, Pantheon Books. 2010. pp. 697-698The Many Moods of Ann Richards was then recorded with Capitol and released in 1960 with music arranged by Bill Holman, Ralph Carmichael and Tak Shindo. Shindo's Japanese folk style arrangement of Jerome Moross's Lazy Afternoon is especially notable as a feature for Richards for the second Capitol LP with her \\"vocal beauty and dramatic flair.\\" In 1960 Richards was featured at Carnegie Hall with the Kenton orchestra and also appeared on Steve Allen‚Äôs NBC-TV show. Recorded at Capitol in July 1960, Two Much! was released in 1961 featuring Ann Richards with the Stan Kenton orchestra. Noted as the highlight of her recording career, she is backed by arrangements of Bill Holman, Johnny Richards and Gene Roland. In a glowing review of Two Much!, Billboard magazine predicted Richards would take her place among past Kenton singing stars such as Anita O‚ÄôDay, June Christy and Chris Connor.Review. Spotlight Winner of the Week. Two Much! Billboard. January 9, 1961. pp 20 By August 1961, Richards' personal and professional relationship with Kenton came to a quick end due to posing for Playboy magazine and concurrently signing a contract with Atco Records without Kenton's knowledge. The cover of her 1961 Atco release Ann, Man! was taken from the June 1961 Playboy photo shoot. 1962 - 1982 By 1962 Richards was in demand at jazz clubs all over the country, including Playboy Clubs due to her pictorial in the magazine. Her Atco release (Ann Man!) was an album of bluesy, sex-kitten songs backed by trumpeter Jack Sheldon and guitarist Barney Kessel. In 1963 Richards continued with some professional successes opening for George Shearing on a tour of Japan. June 1963 she made a successful appearance on the syndicated Ray Anthony Show as a featured artist.Ann Richards sings \\"The Lady Is A Tramp\\" June 8th, 1963.

Her next release with Vee-Jay Records was a live album there, Live at the Losers, but sold disappointingly for Vee-Jay. As rock & roll got bigger, singers like Richards were becoming pass√©. In March 1964 Richards appeared as a musical guest on the New Steve Allen Show. In 1965 she got a short cameo as a bar patron in Angel‚Äôs Flight, a lesser known B film. After this time her singing career never regained the traction she enjoyed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By the mid-‚Äô70s Richards became the resident singer in the lounge of the upscale Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles backed by pianist Bud Herrmann. Film critic Rex Reed, ‚ÄúShe performed half a set seated at my table, with a mic in one hand and a scotch in the other,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúShe sang like a dream.‚Äù Her last major singing tour was in December 1981 (in Japan). She had lost her regular singing engagement at the Hotel Bel-Air when coming home from Japan and was in serious money problems due to her second husband's financial dealings.

In 1961, Richards posed for a nude layout for Playboy magazine's June 1961 issue.Playboy Magazine, June 1961, Ann Richards photo layout She signed a contract to record with Atco, a company other than Capitol Records that her husband was unaware of.The LP cover photo of Ann Richards for the Atco Records release was a picture taken from the Playboy photo shoot, but edited The Playboy shoot was also done without Kenton's knowledge, and he only found out about it while playing at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago when handed the magazine by Charles Suber, who was the publisher of Down Beat magazine at the time.Harris, Steven. The Kenton Kronicles. Dynaflow Publications. 2000. . Kenton then filed for divorce from Richards in August 1961. Stan Kenton won custody of their two children and Ann Richards agreed to a settlement of $50,000 and declined alimony. Her divorce money bought her a small house in the Hollywood Hills. Eventually she took a secretarial job to augment her singing income in the mid-1960s. According to Kenton's third wife, Jo Ann Hill, he was secretly sending Richards checks in order to help with her living expenses. Late in 1978 she married her second husband Bill Botts (Frederick William Botts Jr.). She had been introduced to him through her pianist Bill Marx. By 1980 the two were separated. Richards struggled with drug and alcohol problems until her death in April 1982. Her son, Lance Kenton, in 1980 was sentenced to a year in jail and three years' probation in a high-profile case in Los Angeles for helping to put a rattlesnake in the mailbox of lawyer Paul Morantz. Morantz had handled a successful civil suit against the controversial drug rehabilitation organization Synanon. Kenton was a member of the Imperial Marines, Synanon's internal security force.UPI Archives, Los Angeles, \\"Probation sentences in Synanon rattlesnake attack,\\" November 21, 1980 =Death and controversy= Richards was found dead on April 1, 1982, at her home in the Hollywood Hills and was ruled a suicide by the Los Angeles Police Department. Her estranged husband during that time (Bill Botts) found the body. Richards' death is still considered controversial. There was a bullet wound in Richards' right temple with a rifle lying close by in the room. A letter was also there seemingly written by Richards which discussed the singer's depression. The police read it as a suicide note, although according to her daughter, Dana Kenton, it voiced no clear motive for the death. When visiting the house after the body had been removed, Kenton found cocaine and marijuana that had been planted in the house. They were later revealed to be fake. Both Dana and Lance Kenton pushed for a further investigation with Los Angeles Police Department, but were unsuccessful. Due to connections with insurance policies on Richards' life, Botts has been suspected to be involved (though this claim is unsubstantiated). Later, Richards' close friend Ted Sitterley requested the police report but was turned down. The Los Angeles Police Department currently reports the police report as unavailable and perhaps destroyed. Botts later appeared to claim his share of Richards' estate; she had left no will. ‚ÄúWe argued all the way down to a vacuum cleaner,‚Äù Dana Kenton says. ‚ÄúHe took my mom for every penny she had.‚Äù Memorial and legacy Later in 1982, long time friend Donna Shore organized an all-day memorial at Carmelo's Jazz Club in Sherman Oaks, California, for Richards. Albert Marx, Jack Sheldon, Lou Levy, Bill Henderson and others paid tribute.  Discography  * I'm Shooting High (Capitol, 1958) * The Many Moods of Ann Richards (Capitol, 1960) * Ann, Man!

He is the author of several books, including his autobiography Through A Glass Brightly, published by Robson Books, and founder of the Chaucer Clinic, the UK's largest alcohol project until it closed in 2005. He was director of the Gainsborough Foundation, which provides treatment for alcoholism through GP surgeries across Cambridgeshire from 2008 to 2017. Chaucer Clinic Charles founded the Chaucer Clinic in 1989. Located in Southall, the clinic grew into the largest in the UK, with most \\"members\\" (as they were referred to in the clinic) staying between six and twelve months. In 1998, Charles claimed the clinic had helped thousands of people. For this work, Charles was awarded an MBE for 'Services to people with alcohol problems'. The clinic faced several financial problems following funding cuts in 2001, but stayed open due to private donations, including several from celebrities and musicians following an appeal by Who guitarist Pete Townshend, which helped raise ¬£60,000. The clinic was eventually closed in 2005. Gainsborough Foundation After the Chaucer Clinic closed in 2005, Charles and his team re-located to continue their work in the hope of finding new premises. After meeting with GP's in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, Charles established the Gainsborough Foundation, which offers Charles' unique treatment methods through over 60 GP surgeries across the county. According to statistics kept by the foundation, 78 per cent of patients who complete this treatment are still alcohol-free after two years.

According to a marketing firm, Mediaroom was the market leader in IPTV for 2014. History  =Microsoft TV platform= Microsoft announced an UltimateTV service from DirecTV in October 2000, based on technology acquired from WebTV Networks (later renamed MSN TV). The software was called the Microsoft TV platform (which included the Foundation Edition); it had integrated digital video recorder (DVR) and Internet access capabilities. It was released on October 26, 2000. The software to decode and view digital video programming was derived from WebTV (later called MSN TV). UltimateTV had support for picture-in-picture and could record up to 35 hours of video content. The Internet capabilities were provided by Microsoft TV platform software, which was used for the TV guide. The TV guide could display programming schedule for 14 days, and recording could be scheduled for any of the shows. It could also be used to access E-mail. However, Microsoft lost distribution when DirecTV accepted an acquisition bid by Echostar, who had their own DVR. By 2003, it was taken off the market, even though it is still supported by DirecTV and the acquisition by Echostar failed. The UltimateTV developers in Mountain View, California were eliminated by early 2002. By June 2002, Moshe Lichtman replaced Jon DeVaan as leader of the division as more reductions were announced. Foundation Edition The Microsoft TV Foundation Edition platform integrated video-on-demand (VOD), DVR and HDTV programming with live television programming. It includes an electronic programming guide (EPG) that could be used to access any supported service from a centralized directory. The EPG could be used to search and filter the listings as well. The EPG was released around 2002. Comcast announced it would adopt this software in May 2004. Microsoft TV Foundation Edition platform also included an authoring environment that could be used to create content consumable from the set top box. IPTV Edition Microsoft TV IPTV Edition is an IPTV platform for accessing both on-demand as well as live television content over a 2-way IP network, coupled with DVR functionality.

Abell (March 1, 1932 ‚Äì February 11, 2019) was a professor of meteorology in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Saint Louis University (SLU), where he was a member of the faculty from 1962-2011. He also volunteered as the sole meteorologist for St. Louis, Missouri public radio station KWMU-FM since the station began broadcasting in 1972 through early 2007. To recognize and preserve his contributions as an outstanding member of the St. Louis radio community, Abell was a 2005-2006 inductee to the St. Louis Radio Hall of Fame.  Early and personal life  Born March 1, 1932, Ben Abell grew up in the Washington, D.C. area, and as a child his fascination with weather began when that area suffered severe flooding. He also gained firsthand experience of the consequences of weather working on his uncle's tobacco farm in the summers. Abell has four children, Olga, Kathleen, Ben, and Brian. Olga also studied meteorology at SLU. Abell was an Army intelligence officer in the Korean War.  Professional work  Abell received his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree from Saint Louis University in 1960, continuing with his master of science (M.S.) degree in meteorology and statistics in 1965. Originally intending to work for the National Weather Service (NWS), then the Weather Bureau, after graduation, Abell accepted an offer for a position on staff at (then) Parks College in 1962. He transferred to Saint Louis University upon the merger of Parks College therein, where he remained until his retirement in 2011. His primary research areas were severe local storms, climate change, tropical cyclones, and weather forecasting, while his primary teaching areas were climate and humankind in history, and mesoscale analysis and severe storms. As the undergraduate meteorology program director, he taught some introductory courses in the department as well as serving as the primary contact for prospective and new meteorology students. He was also a forensic meteorologist.  Volunteer forecasting  Abell began his stint as volunteer meteorologist for KWMU when the station began airing in 1972. Before accepting the position at KWMU, students from SLU were making the forecasts and broadcasts for the station, but would make the morning's forecasts the night before to avoid any early-morning engagements. After repeated requests from the fledgling broadcaster, and to better ensure correct and appropriate morning forecasts, Abell acquiesced and accepted the unpaid position as the station's meteorologist. Professor Abell was warmly received for his \\"pragmatic\\" stance on his forecasting, evidenced by his signature phrase: \\"I can't rule it out\\"; forthright with his listeners, Abell lays out the evidences he has for his forecast and the rationales for his conclusions. In addition to computer-generated weather models, Abell draws upon \\"years and years and years of experience\\", and is more inclined to rely on his instinct as opposed to the computer when the two forecasts diverge. The alternative weekly the Riverfront Times (RFT) in 2000 awarded Abell as \\"Best Meteorologist\\". St. Louis city Mayor Clarence Harmon proclaimed February 2, 2000 as Ben Abell Day. Upon retiring from his 35-year volunteer position on April 27, 2007, Abell had provided the St. Louis area with more than 120,000 forecasts. His weather reports were also heard on KFUO-FM, KMOX, KHTR, and KCFM.  Death  Abell died February 11, 2019 in a nursing home, aged 86, afflicted with a number of ailments. As a veteran, he was buried at the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery.Abell, Benjamin F. \\"The Chief\\" - Kutis Funeral Home  References   External links  * Photographs from SLU/Parks College archives) Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:American meteorologists Category:NPR personalities Category:Radio personalities from St. Louis Category:Saint Louis University alumni Category:Saint Louis University faculty Category:Weather presenters Category:1932 births Category:2019 deaths ","title":"Ben Abell"},{"id":"11847431","text":"The 1969 race riots of Singapore were one of the two riots encountered in post-independence Singapore. The seven days of communal riots from 31 May to 6 June 1969, a result of the spillover of the 13 May Incident in Malaysia, resulted in a final toll of 4 dead and 80 wounded.Conceicao. \\"The 13th May 1969 (Kuala Lumpur) Disturbances\\", pp. 112‚Äî113 Singapore did not experience a riot until 44 years later (2013 Little India riots). History The precursor of the 1969 race riots can be traced to the 13 May Incident in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya in Malaysia. It was triggered by the results of the General Election, which were marked by Sino-Malay riots unprecedented in Malaysian history ‚Äì 196 people were killed and over 350 injured between 13 May and 31 July. The real figures could be much higher than officially revealed. The Malaysian government declared a state of emergency and suspended Parliament until 1971. The disturbances had nothing to do with Singapore but there was an inexorable spillover of the communal violence in Malaysia into Singapore. The 1969 riots occurred not long after the earlier communal riots in 1964. It was said that the 1964 racial disturbances in Singapore contributed towards the eventual separation of Singapore from Malaysia on 9 August 1965. The hysteria that United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) itself generated over its desire to assert Malay dominance (Ketuanan Melayu) in Singapore had its effect in heightening the suspicion between Malay and Chinese in Singapore. The dissatisfaction of the Malays over their social and economic condition and the fear that the Malays regarded as indigenous (Bumiputra) ownership would be lost, led to the 13 May disturbances. =Rumours and revenge= Rumours began to spread in Singapore about Malay atrocities against the Chinese in Malaysia. People also talked indignantly about the partiality of the Malaysian Armed Forces in dealing with those suspected of involvement in the rioting; Chinese that were caught were severely punished on the spot and these rumours aggravated tension in Singapore.Conceicao. \\"Rumours and revenge\\", p. 114. Reserve Unit Policemen lined the width of Bras Basah Road to reinforce the policemen nearby Over 500 people were injured and 36 lives were lost in the clashes between Chinese and Malays. The Internal Security Department (Singapore) or ISD, together with the Police, helped contain a volatile situation. Sino-Malay tensions surfaced again in Singapore in 1969 following the outbreak of the 1969 racial riots in Malaysia after the General Election. Many incidents of Sino-Malay clashes erupted and the situation was brought under control following security sweeps by the Police and armed forces throughout Singapore. The vigilance of the security forces in Singapore and the persistent efforts of ISD officers in making island-wide coverage contributed to the return of normalcy in Singapore. Aftermath After 1971, when all had settled down, the Malaysian government was able to follow an affirmative action policy marked particularly by the New Economic Policy (NEP) favouring the Malays. To this day, there is still an unease about the potential of violence as the power struggles between groups continue. In Apr 1987, four silat (martial arts) experts were arrested by the ISD for actively spreading rumours of impending racial clashes on or around 13 May 1987 (on the 18th anniversary of the May 1969 race riots in Singapore and Malaysia).

It is the only rock formation in Jutland, the only bird cliff on the Danish mainland, and as such the only breeding place of the black-legged kittiwake on the Danish mainland. Bulbjerg lies in the traditional district of Hanherred, close to Thy. History For centuries, chalk blocks were sawed out of the cliff and used as a building material in the surrounding area or burnt to quicklime. Former visitors have carved their names in the limestone, including a 19th-century king whose name can still be seen. During World War II, the German occupation force used Bulbjerg as a lookout point and built a small concrete fortification which still exists. =Skarreklit= Skarreklit in August 1977 Skarreklit was a rock column in the sea about 100 metres off Bulbjerg. It fell down in a storm in 1978, but its base can be seen at low tide and calm sea. The base of the column was flint, allowing the column to withstand the forces of the waves, long after the sea had eroded the softer limestone around it. According to a legend, the fall of the column would mean the end of the world. Skarreklit is presumably named after the cormorant (Danish: skarv, Jutlandic dialect: skar); klit means 'dune', in Jutlandic also 'cliff'.

Biography Anita Caracotchian was born in Ermont in Seine-et-Oise to a wealthy Armenian family. She spent her childhood being educated at home by different tutors and travelling with her family, gradually developing a passion for books and the sea. After moving to Paris, she concentrated on writing poems and the art of book binding. Her work got the attention of celebrities and she won different awards and prizes for her creativity in London, Paris, New York and Brussels. In 1927, she married a diplomat, Marcel Conti, and started traveling around the world, exploring the seas, documenting and reporting what she saw and experimented. Spending time on the fishing boats for days and even months on certain occasions gave her a deeper understanding of the problematic faced by the fishermen. In between the two world war, she developed the technique of fishing maps apart from the already used navigational charts. For two years, from one vessel to another, she observed the French fishermen along the coast and Saharan Africa discovering fish species unknown in France. She published many scientific reports on the negative effects of industrial fishing and the different problems related to fishing practices. From 1943 and approximately for 10 years, she studied in the Mauritian islands, Senegal, Guinea and Ivory Coast, the nature of the seabed, different fish species and their nutritional values in regards of protein deficiency for the local populations. Gradually, she developed better preservation techniques, fishing methods and installed artificial dens for further studies. She even founded an experimental fishery for sharks. She became more and more conscientious of the misuse of natural resources by the fishing industry and the major waste that could be prevented. In 1971 she published L‚ÄôOcean, Les Betes et L‚ÄôHomme, to denounce the disaster that men create and its effects on the oceans. Through many conferences and forums and for the rest of her life, she advocated for the betterment of the marine world. She died on 25 December 1997 in Douarnenez.

Geography  Innes Park residential area is located on a low rocky section of the coast with two small beaches either side. The northern beach is 400 metres long and has a high tide sand beach fronted by a mixture of sand and boulders at low tide. There is good road access at the southern end, with a small foredune behind the beach and a now stable sand blow at the northern end. The southern Innes Park beach straddles the mouth of Palmer Creek. It is 400 metres long and consists of a narrow strip of high tide sand fronted by a continuous, sloping boulder field, with some sand in the small creek mouth. The beach is backed by a casuarina- covered foredune and a park with BBQs, children's playground, exercise facilities, beach volleyball court, public conveniences and car parks grouped at its southern end. There is a boat ramp with road access on the northern side of the inlet. All four beaches are only suitable for swimming toward high tide, with low tide generally revealing a rocky shoreline. Currents in and out of the creeks can be very strong mid-tide. There are various reef breaks along this coast, which need to be checked out with the locals. You can find some good rock fishing the length of the coast, as well as in the small creek at Innes Park. The foreshore is part of the Great Sandy Marine Park. As such, there are limits on some activities off shore. It is part of a turtle monitoring area and spearfishing, bait netting, crabbing, and line fishing are forbidden south of the mouth of Palmer Creek to past Barolin Rocks for 500m east of the low tide line History The Innes Park area was first occupied by European settlers in 1863, as part of the Barolin pastoral station. The Barolin House homestead, near Elliott Heads, about south of Innes Park, was later built on the station. In 1912 the property was acquired by Sidney Innes, who in 1930 donated land to the Shire of Woongarra for recreation purposes. In the 1970s the emerging seaside town was named after the original donor.  Facilities  Facilities at Innes Park include the Innes Park Country Club, a bakery, and a creekside park with children's playground, beach volleyball court, and boat ramp at the mouth of Palmer Creek. Barolin Rocks is a popular snorkel diving site. The Coral Cove resort and residential development is immediately south of the town and includes a golf course with club house and a small convenience store.

Located in Seletar, the S$60 million plan to develop 140 hectares of land adjacent to Seletar Airport will further strengthen Singapore's position as an aviation hub. The development of the new aerospace park is geared towards delivering additional space for industry expansion, and complement existing aerospace activities at Changi North and Loyang. History In May 2006, the Singapore Government together with the Economic Development Board (EDB) and JTC Corporation unveiled the plan of a new aerospace park. Decision was made when Singapore's aerospace industry has seen soaring growth potential and also a strong demand for aviation-related services. JTC Corporation was asked to carry out the master-planning and infrastructure improvements for Seletar Aerospace Park, in consultation with other government agencies. The development of the new aerospace hub is expected to take care of the industry's land needs for at least 10 years. Seletar Aerospace Park will host an integrated cluster of activities such as aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul; design and manufacturing of aerospace systems and components; business and general aviation activities, and an aviation campus for the training of pilots, aviation professionals and technical personnel. =Master Plan= The master plan for Seletar Aerospace Park was announced by JTC Corporation on 26 June 2007. The Seletar Airport will be undergoing upgrading to support the park. The plans include the lengthening of the airport's runway from its current length to 1,800 metres and the upgrading of its avionics systems to allow bigger aircraft to land and take off. New roads, better infrastructure and more than 100 football fields of space will be available to the cluster of companies that design and manufacture aircraft components and small jets, as well as run training schools. Not only. The park will be developed at a cost of more than S$60 million, and will be carried out in phases. When completed by 2018, it will create 10,000 jobs, predominantly skilled and technical positions. The park will also help double the output of Singapore's fast-growing aerospace sector, from 2006's record of S$6.3 billion. Tenants affected by the first phase of the development are preparing to relocate to a temporary area. In finalising the master plan for Seletar, the idyllic, tranquil nature of the area with its more than 300 black-and-white colonial bungalows, old trees and open fields has been retained, as much as possible. Of the 378 black-and-white bungalows, 204 will be retained. Some will be converted into aerospace training schools and food and beverage outlets, while 131 units will be set aside for residential use. For the same reason, more than 30 distinctive trees will not be cut down. Tenants =Current= The first few tenants moved into their new premises in the third quarter of 2010.

After the launch of the second flight model, they comprised the first complete telecommunications satellite system (including an on-orbit spare and a dedicated ground control segment). They were the result of a program of formal cooperation between France and Germany.  1963‚Äì1970: Beginnings  * January 22, 1963: Signing by President Charles de Gaulle and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of the √âlys√©e Treaty, an agreement for Franco-German cooperation. Start of preliminary studies in France (SAROS project) and in Germany (Olympia project) of communications satellites. * June 1967: Both countries sign an intergovernmental convention concerning the launch and exploitation of an experimental telecommunication satellite (Symphonie) and the development and construction of earth stations necessary for control of the satellites. Formation of a Franco-German board of directors and executive committee. The committee is headed by two executive secretaries ‚Äì one German and the other French. Belgium joins the program. * 1967‚Äì1968: A Request for Proposals is launched for the Symphonie satellite, which was answered by two Franco-German consortia. The leaders are, respectively, Nord Aviation (which was to become A√©rospatiale after merging with Sud Aviation) for the CIFAS consortium (Consortium Industrial Franco-Allemande pour le satellite Symphonie) and Matra Space for the competing consortium. The CIFAS consortium was selected after the evaluation of bids and undertook, according to the terms of the consultation, a rounding-out of the various roles of the French and German firms in charge of electronic technology. * 1969: Beginning of a preliminary definition phase of the satellite, and negotiation of the contract and main subcontracts. Establishment of the industrial project team in Les Mureaux (Nord Aviation) and the client-project group in Br√©tigny-sur-Orge (CNES). Production of mission specifications, satellite specifications and specifications for the control and exploitation segments.  Industrial Organization  Within the bilateral (CNES ‚Äì GfW) French-German contract, and under industrial prime contractorship of the CIFAS consortium (which was a European economic interest grouping under French law) composed of six companies (three French and three German), their responsibilities were as follows: = A√©rospatiale (France) = *Consortium leader and host of the integrated project team at its centre at Les Mureaux. * Structures, and thermal-control subsystems and manufacture of all associated panels, mechanisms, thermal hardware and antenna reflectors (Cannes Space Centre). * Manufacture of the cold gas attitude control system, harness and pyrotechnics (Les Mureaux). * Integration of mechanical and thermal models (Cannes). * Integration of the electrical identification model and the first flight model, Symphonie-A (Les Mureaux). = Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) (RFA) = * Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) (Ottobrunn, near Munich). * Manufacture of the hot-gas (bi-propellant) thruster system (Ottobrunn and Lampoldshausen). * Apogee motor (bi-propellant) subsystem (Ottobrunn and Lampoldshausen). * Mechanical ground-support equipment for integration and transport. * Contribution of electrical test sets. * Integration of the qualification prototype and the second flight model, Symphonie-B (Ottobrunn). = Thomson-CSF (France) = * Super high frequency (SHF)-antenna subsystem for telecommunications payload and VHF-antenna subsystem for the TT&C; (Meudon). * Manufacture of the TT&C; system (Gennevilliers and V√©lizy- Villacoublay). * Manufacture of equipment for telecommunications transponders, local oscillators and frequency conversion. * Electronic test system (EGSE level 1) for ground testing (integration phase and preparation for flight). = Siemens AG (RFA) = * SHF C-band telecommunications transponder subsystem (Munich). * Manufacture of equipment for telecommunications transponders, receiving section and intermediary frequency amplification (Munich). * Contribution of electrical test set. = SAT (France) = * Solar-array subsystem (Paris and Lannion). * Manufacture of telemetry encoder (Paris). * Contribution to electrical test sets. = AEG-Telefunken (RFA) = * Regulated electric power supply subsystem (Wedel, near Hamburg). * Manufacture of equipment for the telecommunications transponders, transmission section (Backnang ‚Äì near Stuttgart ‚Äì and Ulm). * Manufacture of SHF modulators and demodulators for onboard telemetry and telecommand. * Contribution to electrical test sets. = Other major contributions = * The six CIFAS companies participated in the integrated project team with detached personnel, headed by Pierre Madon (A√©rospatiale). * Belgium officially contributed to the project; its industrial presence included the Ateliers de Constructions Electriques de Charleroi (ACEC) and the space division of ETCA, supplier of the DC-DC converters for the electric power supply; and SAIT for the EGSE test computers. * French and German equipment manufacturers contributed under contract to the consortium members (notably Sodern, SAFT, Crouzet and Starec in France and Teldix and VFW in Germany). * Major test facilities used for the qualification and acceptance tests (space environment simulation): SOPEMEA (a subsidiary of CNES in Toulouse) and IABG in (Ottobrunn). * Calibration of telecommunications performance: Centre National d'Etudes des Telecommunications (CNET, in La Turbie).  1970: Satellite development  * 1970‚Äì1971: Beginning of the Symphonie satellite development program, with a contract signed by General Robert Aubini√®re (Director General of CNES) and Dr. Mayer (representing the German ministry) Bundesministerium f√ºr Wissenschaft und Forschung (BMWF). The CIFAS consortium (organized as a European economic interest grouping and whose administrator at the time was Charles Cristofini) went through several restructurings with the creation of Thomson-CSF, MBB (Messerschmitt Bolkow Blohm), AEG Telefunken and A√©rospatiale. * 1972: The failure of the Europa II launch vehicle and the abandonment of the program (which had been led by the ELDO) triggers a crisis; it is uncertain if development should continue or, if so, how the satellites will be deployed. After some governmental hesitation, the program continues. The satellites will be launched by the American Thor Delta 2914 satellite-launch vehicles, at the cost of a restrictive agreement; any commercial use of Symphonie is forbidden by the U.S. State Department. * 1973: Integration of the test and qualification models of the satellite. * 1974: Integration in Les Mureaux of the first flight model (Symphonie-A) and delivery of the satellite.  Launch and lifespan alt=The rocket used to launch the satellites, before its launch * 1974: Symphonie-A was successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center on December 19, 1974, at 2:39 a.m. UT. * 1975: (January 12) President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing of France and German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt exchange their New Year greetings live in a videoconference, via Symphonie-A in geostationary orbit. Symphonie-A is the first geostationary telecommunications satellite built and operated in Europe; some of its technology is groundbreaking. * 1975: After its integration at MBB in Ottobrunn and delivery, Symphonie-B is launched from the Kennedy Space Center on August 27, 1975, at 1:42 a.m. UT. * 1975: The two satellites are positioned in geostationary orbit at 11.5¬∞ west, perfectly fulfilling their mission (two coverage zones, Euro-African and America, can fully benefit from 4 wideband transponders of 90 MHz each); they are the stars of the 1975 Geneva Telecom Show. * 1977‚Äì1979: For two years beginning in June 1977, Symphonie-A is repositioned over the Indian Ocean at 49¬∞ east, where it carries out experiments with India and China. * February 4‚Äì7, 1980: An international colloquium is held in Berlin concerning the technical and operational results of the program. Among the presentations, Professor Hubert Curien (then- president of CNES) declared in brief, \\"Symphonie is the father of Ariane\\"; it served as the catalyst for the European decision to develop a heavy launch vehicle. * August 12, 1983: Symphonie-A makes its final manoeuvre to a graveyard orbit, and is de-activated after years of service. * December 19, 1984: Exactly ten years after the launch of Symphonie-A, Symphonie-B is also deactivated and placed in a graveyard orbit after nine years of active service. The Symphonie satellites operated successfully for double their expected lifespans, performing hundreds of experiments and expanding the horizons of telecommunications in space.  Uses  Symphonie was the forerunner for numerous telecommunications services. Its prohibition on commercial use may have paradoxically induced a larger program for experimentation of space telecommunications than ever before ‚Äì both in the number of participating countries and diversity of field applications. As an example of the extent of its use, 40 countries participated in links via Symphonie A and B (east-west and north-south) ‚Äì from Quebec to Argentina, from Finland to Reunion Island and from China to Indonesia. The Symphonie A and B experiments may be divided into two types: * Humanitarian, cultural and educational experiments. * Technical and scientific experiments. To these types operational experiments may be added, notably for links between metropolitan France and its overseas departments for telephony and television via satellite. From this viewpoint Symphonie was a forerunner of the French national programs Telecom-1 & 2 and TDF 1 & 2, and the German programs TV-SAT and DFS Kopernikus. The wideband transponders, with their operational flexibility, made it possible to test all-access techniques (single or multiple) and modulation: FDMA (frequency sharing), TDMA (time sharing) and SSMA (spread spectrum). Symphonie terrestrial stations with antennas of various diameters from 16 to 2.2 meters (fixed, portable and mobile) contributed to the renown of the programme around the world. + Several demonstrations were: * Links between United Nations headquarters in New York and Geneva and the UN Blue Helmet squadrons in Jerusalem and Isma√Ølia ‚Äì inaugurating the future communications mode VSAT (very small aperture terminal), using small-diameter ground antennas. * Educational television in Africa, particularly in C√¥te d'Ivoire and Gabon. * Intercultural exchanges via teleconferencing, telerehabilitation and telemedicine, notably between France and Quebec. * Occasional tele-transmission services (emergency links to disaster areas for the Red Cross, sports reporting and so on). * High-speed, bidirectional links between computers ‚Äì a forerunner of transcontinental data communications and the Internet. * Synchronization of atomic clocks on an intercontinental scale, to obtain a very high stability of universal time ‚Äì a forerunner to navigation and positioning satellites GPS and Galileo. * Regional-level tests for mixed analog and digital television and radio broadcasting (now used in many countries ‚Äì for example Iran, India and China). One opportunity to demonstrate Symphonie's utility in 1978 was not used; it could have been utilized in Kolwezi (the intervention of French troops in Zaire to protect Europeans living in Katanga), if the French chiefs of staff had followed the above-mentioned UN example rather than calling upon logistical support from the United States.  After Symphonie  Symphonie's ten years of service have been credited with developing the maturity and reliability of space technology, at a time when telecommunications operators were thinking in terms of cables and ground microwave links. After Intelsat (a pioneer in intercontinental telephony), Symphonie led to the development of regional systems with a number of applications (including tele-distribution, tele-education and reliable radio-electrical access) for use in isolated areas with no ground infrastructure and low population density. The Symphonie program was also a training program; it trained engineers, operators and satellite users, who acquired their expertise through the program and distributed it on the European and international level. Afterwards, new European programs followed and enabled Europe to attain excellence in the field of space telecommunications. The technical success of this precursor program, the demonstration in orbit of the quality of technology born in Europe and the diverse uses benefiting many countries and communities make Symphonie one of the major bases of Europe's success in space. On the industrial level, it helped launch Europe into major space programs and spurred an industrial restructuring which transformed national industries into European groups. Most of Symphonie's industrial partners contributed to the genesis of the Spacebus programs, and to commercial applications in space communications and direct-to-home TV broadcasting.  Firsts  Symphonie was the: * First three-axis stabilized communications satellite in geostationary orbit with a bipropellant rocket propulsion system (to ensure geostationary orbit injection and orbit control during its entire lifespan). * First European communications satellite system.  Satellites  https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/symphonie-1.htm * Symphonie A (aka Symphonie 1, COSPAR 1974-101A), launched 19 December 1974 at 2:39 UT from Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral) LC-17B aboard Delta-2914 rocket to geostationary orbit.

It is located to the west of the city and has for long time been its major air defence asset. Currently the base is disbanded with the only activity being guarding duty of the airframes of MiG-23s, conserved at the field.Alexander Mladenov, \\"Dobroslavtsi is standing down. An Airbase until 2001?\\", in: \\"Klub Krile Magazine\\", Vol. 1, 2000, \\"Air Group 2000\\" Publishing, Sofia, Bulgaria. A Bulgarian version of the article at the magazine's virtual archive  Establishment  The military airbase was opened for operations on the 20 April 1952 as part of the huge modernization program of the air force, intended to transit the inventory in the jet age. The 18th and 43rd Fighter Air Regiments of the 4th Fighter Air Division were transferred to the base, formed two years earlier at Vrazhdebna Airfield. The aircraft type operated by the two regiments by the time of the re-basing was the Yak-9M/P fighter and a small quantity of Yak-11 fighter- trainers. Shortly afterwards a major boost in the units' operational capabilities has been achieved with the introduction of the Yak-23s and Yak-17U - Bulgaria's first jet fighter type - into operations on 17 May 1952. Still a minor group of Yak-9s remained on quick reaction duty until 1954. The year 1955 saw the 18th Fighter Air Regiment converting to the MiG-15 and four years later - to the MiG-17F. The 43rd Fighter Air Regiment flew the MiG-15 from 1956 until its disbandment in 1960.  The Supersonic Years  The 1st Squadron of the 18th FAR transitioned to the supersonic MiG-19S/P in 1963. The following year saw a group of the regiment's flight officers being dispatched to the USSR for an operational conversion course to the advanced MiG-21 fighter. Upon arming with the MiG-21PF aircraft (12 units) the 2nd Squadron was transferred to the Gabrovnitsa Airfield in the country's northwestern area. After an upgrade in 1969, the regiment's MiG-19P were brought to a standard, which allowed them to carry two K-13 Air-to-Air missiles with IR- homing. In 1975 the 1st Squadron (in Dobroslavtsi) transitioned to the outstanding for its time MiG-21MF fighter and declared operational readiness the following year. At the time these events occurred the squadron leader was Georgi Ivanov Kakalov, the country's first cosmonaut. The major re-armament program of the Bulgarian Air Force, started in the 1970s saw the squadron once again converting to a superb fighter type, when a group of pilots and ground engineers went to the Soviet Union (The Operational Conversion Center at Lugovoye, Kyrgyz SSR) for a conversion course to the MiG-23MF in 1978. On the 10 October the first of 12 MiG-23MFs and 3 MiG-23UMs arrived at Dobroslavtsi AB. The aircraft's ability to intercept enemy machines unspotted, using its IR sensors and the armament of R-23R/T BVR Air-to-Air missiles in addition to the new R-60 short-range Air-to-Air missiles made the BAF the best air arm in southeastern Europe. The live firings at the Astrakhan Range, USSR, made shortly after achieving operational readiness and being graded \\"excellent\\" have shown that the Bulgarian pilots have been trained to the fullest of the aircraft's capabilities. During the Warsaw Pact's major scale maneuvers in the 1980s the Bulgarian MiG-23s were even able to intercept Soviet MiG-25 recon planes, entering Bulgarian airspace from Romania and flying at speeds of Mach=2.5+ and altitudes of 20000+ meters. In 1982 the 18th Fighter Air Regiment's 3rd Squadron was disbanded. This unit has for long time been the air defence force's operational training unit for fighter pilots. The tactics needed for air defence tasks were obtained by the newly formed pilots and a required number of flight hours was achieved by them before transferring to a front-line squadron of the 1st or 2nd Air Defence Divisions. The same year 8 MiG-23MLAs were received by the 1st Squadron, this new variant being able to fire R-24 advanced BVR-missiles. At the end of 1991 the last MiG-23s being acquired by Bulgaria were delivered to Dobroslavtsi. Those were second-hand MLDs of the specially developed sub-variant for countering the F-15s and F-16s. The five units saw action in Afghanistan and came from the 168th Fighter Air Regiment of the Soviet Airforce at Starokonstantinov, modern Ukraine. That was part of a deal, struck with Moscow for the 3 remaining Bulgarian MiG-25s.  Years of Decline  The economical difficulties of the country led to a rapid decline of flight activity and operational readiness in the 1990s. In 1994 the 18th FAR was disbanded and the 1st Air Defence Base was formed, comprising the 1st Fighter Air Squadron, being named \\"Knights of the Sky\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20001013161146/http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Gym/3055/Dobroslavtsi/D1.jpg and a number of ground units, supporting the squadron's flight operations. In 1998 the former regiment's airbase at Gabrovnitsa (being reformed as 2nd Air Defence Base and its squadron named \\"Wild Cat\\") ceased operations and its aircraft and personnel were transferred to Dobroslavtsi. So the 1st AD Base acquired its MiG-23MLDs and UBs. In accordance with \\" Reform Plan 2004\\" of the armed forces the base was disbanded in 2002.

Dimensions When built, they had driving wheels (later due to thicker tyres) and , or cylinders. Half-cabs were added a few years after construction. From 1918 all but eight of the class were rebuilt with Belpaire fireboxes and larger, pannier tanks extending over the smokebox, and the diameter cylinders became standard. Use Most of the 645s and 1501s were allocated to the Northern Division of the GWR. Between 1910 and 1922 three more of them, Nos. 1806, 1811 and 1546, were transferred to the SWMR, and others too went to South Wales. Most were withdrawn in 1930s. Nos. 1531, 1532, 1538 and 1542 passed briefly into British Railways ownership, but all went by December 1949. None has survived into preservation.

This feature incorporates a weather beacon barometer, and is a key component of the overall composition of the project. The barometer is a particular response to 'place', and alludes to the maritime history of the precinct. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the site was at the harbour's edge, being the heart of Sydney's maritime trade, and was the principal trade route into the city centre. The architectural roof feature comprises: * Two metal clad base elements with the larger of the two capped by an internally illuminated white glass tower. The glass tower is 25 metres high and nine metres across. * Eight red LED illuminated bars (on the north and south faces of the white glass tower), the lowest representing 990 hPa, rising in 5 hPa increments to the top bar representing 1025 hPa. This provides real time information on barometric pressure changes. Generally low pressure indicates inclement weather and high pressure with good or clear weather (although this is not always the case). As the pressure rises or falls, the LED bars will appear to ripple in an upward or downward direction respectively. The illumination level of the LED bars and tower is controlled by a roof mounted photosensor. The LEDs will be brightest in the middle of the day, and will start to smoothly dim before dusk, and after darkness will reach a low illumination level.

It began in early March 2007, when US and Iraqi forces commenced preliminary operations to \\"establish a presence in Diyala beyond their Forward Operating Base\\".Securing Diyala  Institute for the Study of War In June 2007 as part of a larger country wide offensive, Operation Arrowhead Ripper was launched to gain control of Baqubah and its surrounding areas from the insurgents.\\"Task Force Lightning strikes Al-Qaeda\\" Multi-National Corps ‚Äì Iraq, Public Affairs Office, 19 June 2007 Baqubah was largely pacified as a result of this operation although insurgent presence still remained in the capital and throughout the province. In August 2007, Operation Phantom Strike was launched throughout northern Iraq in order to capitalize on the gains made during Operation Phantom Thunder. As part of this offensive, Operation Lightning Hammer was launched to the northeast of Baqubah. Background In mid-October 2006, al-Qaeda announced the creation of Islamic state of Iraq (ISI),Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.183 replacing the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC) and its al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). In late 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq forces began a quiet troop build-up in Baqubah, naming it the capital of their \\"Islamic State of Iraq\\". As a result of the Baghdad Security Plan, in early 2007 Al Qaeda in Iraq forces withdrew from Baghdad in large numbers and began furthering operations in Diyala province.The Unraveling, Emma Sky p203 Emma Sky describes it as, at that time, the most violent part of Iraq.The Unraveling, Emma Sky p204 The insurgents fortified the province with observation posts, fighting positions, mines, and booby-trapped houses, as well as establishing supply bases and training camps. The large majority of these forces were positioned in the city of Baqubah, which was of great importance to Al Qaeda forces, having been declared the Capital of the Islamic State of Iraq. Military Intelligence templated the Al Qaeda forces within the city at 2500 fighters, and an additional 500 support forces. Timeline =Battle for Baqubah II begins= A tactic employed by the insurgents in Buhriz was hit-and-run attacks with RPGs. With the support of Apache gunships firing Hellfire missiles, U.S. forces were able to inflict between 40 and 50 insurgent casualties on 14 March. Soldiers from the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment, conduct operations in Buhriz, 20 March 2007 A decision was made on 15 March to consolidate the task force and begin clearance operations of the palm groves surrounding Buhriz. What followed was close quarters jungle warfare more reminiscent of Vietnam than Iraq. The insurgent forces used a hit and run strategy, employing snipers, mines, prepositioned ambush sites, and escape routes. Insurgent forces were also confirmed to have fired at least one SA-7 missile at an Apache attack Helicopter, resulting in a very near miss.Eye-witness account After a fierce week-long battle, Buhriz was predominantly under the control of American forces. While insurgents were no longer able to operate openly in Buhriz, there were still a small number of hit and run attacks, to include the use of mines, small arms, and snipers in this neighborhood. One such sniper attack on 24 May 2007 resulted in the death of a soldier from Task Force Regulars. Over the next two months, a task force built around the 5-20 INF battalion which had expanded to include Bronco Troop 1-14 Cavalry and two companies (A and B) of the 1st battalion, 12th Cavalry, systematically cleared the eastern half of Baqubah, and some of its outlying villages in the toughest fighting the battalion experienced during its 15-month deployment. A soldier assigned to the 1st Platoon, Company B, 1-12 Combined Arms Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, guards a street in the neighborhood of Tahrir in Baqubah, Iraq, 28 March 2007 The heavily fortified, and well defended Al-Qaeda controlled neighborhoods of Tahrir and New Baqubah were the next to be taken by American forces. The offensive's forward progression was again slowed by the use of large ambushes initiated by deep-buried mines or car bombs. One such ambush, on 5 April, resulted in a Bradley fighting vehicle being destroyed and the death of one American soldier. Of note, Army medic Christopher Waiters was eventually awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroic actions that day which saved the lives of two additional American soldiers in the destroyed Bradley vehicle. Another similar attack initiated by a large deep buried mine killed six American soldiers in a Stryker vehicle on 6 May 2007. The house-to-house fighting seen in eastern Baqubah during this offensive was the fiercest fighting in Iraq at the time. Al-Qaeda in Iraq was pitching a last-ditch effort to retain control of their self-declared capital. On 27 May while clearing Chibernat, a village north of Baqubah, seven Iraqi hostages were rescued from an Al Qaeda torture center. While clearance of eastern Baqubah was being completed, Task Force Regulars was able to successfully isolate and contain the western half of the city, composed of Mufrek, Mujema, and Khatoon. Without adequate forces to clear this western half of Baqubah the commander of Task Force Regular, Lt. Colonol Bruce Antonia, requested additional forces to assist in that task. =Operation Arrowhead Ripper= In early June Lt. Colonel Antonia's request for assistance was answered. The 3/2 Brigade Command Staff and the Regular's sister Battalion the 1st Battalion 23rd infantry, Tomahawks arrived. In June 2007 US and Iraqi forces launched a major offensive operation throughout Iraq codenamed Operation Phantom Thunder designed to secure the Baghdad Belts. As part of this offensive, Multinational Division North launched Operation Arrowhead Ripper in Diyala province. The 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division along with members of the 2-505th 82nd Airborne Division, launched the offensive with a quick-strike night-time air assault early on 18 June 2007.

The local population were overjoyed to be, as they put it, \\"liberated\\" by the American Forces. These neighborhoods, while under Al Qaeda control, had been subjected to Sharia, very strict Islamic law, with severe penalties. The local populace talked of things like smoking, women failing to wear appropriate facial and body coverings, or even placing cucumbers too close to tomatoes on a vegetable cart as being very harshly punished. This was the location of several Al Qaeda detention and torture centers, where punishments handed down by these Islamic courts were carried out. These punishments included amputation, eye removal, and death just to name a few. On 23 June two suspected senior Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn leaders were captured and detained to Baghdad; no further information on their identity has been forthcoming. It is feared that most high-profile suspects have fled the area before the operation began. As of 26 June, significant fighting continued. Insurgent casualties were given as 55 on 23 June. Until 27 June, an estimated 5 more militants, possibly more, were reported killed by Coalition sources. By 28 June, fighting in at least parts of the town had ceased. US and allied troops were documented moving about in daylight and relaxed poses.\\"Photo of the Day: US and Iraqi Troops on the Streets of Baquba\\". IraqSlogger, 2007-JUN-29. Retrieved 2007-JUN-29.

On the other hand, the town of Al Khalis, approx. 15 km away, seems to have become a major restaging point for insurgents retreating from Baqubah, despite the nearby presence of significant US forces at FOB Grizzly and People's Mujahedin of Iran personnel at \\"Ashraf City\\". On 3 July, MNF troops killed 25 and detained five suspected terrorists and uncovered 10 weapons caches during a 3-day operation at Mukhisa, NE of Baqubah, in support of Operation Arrowhead Ripper. However, fighting flared up again some days later, with numerous reports of casualties later that week. Residents reported that the shelling was intense,\\"More death and political intrigue\\" Nermeen Al-Mufti, Al-Ahram Weekly, 5‚Äì11 July 2007 and the Iraqi Islamic Party (ISP) has accused the Multi-National Forces operating in the area of committing a new massacre in Baqubah. \\"The operations led by the US forces in western Baqubah led to the death of more than 350 people, most of whom are still under the rubble,\\" the ISP said in a statement. The majority of American shelling and aerial bombardment that occurred during July and August was to defeat the overwhelming number of explosive laden houses, that were rigged and left behind as traps by the fleeing Al Qaeda forces. One such home was detonated on American forces attempting to clear it of insurgent forces on 6 August, and resulted in four American deaths. The US army admits that nearly 80 per cent of Al-Qaeda leaders fled the area, in June, during the initial stages of the operation. 15 July Aco 1-12 Cavalry engaged insurgents in the Mechanics area of Southern Baqubah, killing 2 and wounding 3. 16 July, Aco 1-12 Cav members were ambushed while patrolling in insurgent occupied areas of Palm Groves south of Baqubah on the Diyala river. Several friendly Sunni militiamen were killed and wounded by a mine that initiated the ambush. On 14 August, the overall operation Phantom Thunder ended and operation Arrowhead Ripper ended 19 August. Baqubah was largely secured by Coalition forces, but still some insurgent presence remained in the city and surrounding areas, but not in such large numbers as it was before the attack on the city. =Operation Lightning Hammer= Lightning Hammer I was launched on 13 August 2007 as a follow-on to Operation Arrowhead Ripper and was subordinate to Operation Phantom Strike. The aim of the operation was to clear insurgent elements from the Diyala river valley and involved around 16,000 US and Iraqi forces. During the operation, 50 villages in the Diyala province were cleared, 26 members of AQI were killed and 37 suspected insurgents were detained. On 1 September, the operation ended.

Pejoratively called as Literatura de la Onda by Margo Glantz in the beginning, the movement quickly grew and included other art forms with its followers called \\"onderos\\", \\"macizos\\" or \\"jipitecas\\". La Onda encompassed artistic productions in the worlds of cinema, literature, visual arts and music and strongly addressed social issues of the time such as women's rights, ecology, spirituality, artistic freedom, open drug use and democracy in a country tightly ruled by the PRI. According to Mexican intellectual Carlos Monsiv√°is, La Onda was \\"a new spirit, the repudiation of convention and prejudice, the creation of a new morality, the challenging of proper morals, the expansion of consciousness, the systematic revision and critique of the values offered by the West as sacred and perfect.\\"  La Onda in music  La Onda began with the importation of American and British rock and roll into the Mexican music culture. Throughout the world, rock and roll was spreading and taking root as \\"a wedge and a mirror for societies caught in the throes of rapid modernization\\". According to Eric Zolov, author of Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture, \\"rock was a wedge in the sense that it challenged traditional boundaries of propriety, gender relations, social hierarchies, and the very meaning of national identity\\" which the Mexican PRI (or the Institutional Revolutionary Party) was struggling to define.Refried, p10 By the late 1950s, \\"youth from the middle classes began to form their own bands‚Ä¶practicing as best they could versions of hit songs in English by their favorite foreign rock'n'rollers\\".Refried, p62 The youth of Mexico began to identify with the youth of the United States and the United Kingdom, and it was only a matter of time before they were also inspired by the social activism of other modernizing countries. After the 1968 Mexican student movements ended in the Tlatelolco massacre in Mexico City, a native hippie movement known as jipitecas grew in its wake and expanded to the entire country as well as parts of the US and Central America. By 1969, a new wave of Mexican rock music began to emerge, fusing Mexican and foreign music with images of political protest. This movement was called La Onda Chicana, culminating in a two-day \\"Mexican Woodstock\\" known as (Av√°ndaro) which attracted ca. 300,000 people in September 1971.  La Onda in literature  Starting in 1965, La Onda made its mark on the \\"new Central-American novel\\" and other genres. The wave of popular Mexican novels in the 1960s, \\"emphasized the sentiments of the new urban middle-class adolescent and the influence of United States culture, rock music, the generation gap, and the hippie movement.\\" La Onda influenced many Mexican authors and intellectuals, like Jos√© Agust√≠n, liberal priest Enrique Marroquin, ecologist Carlos Baca and Parm√©nides Garcia Salda√±a. Alberto Blanco and Gustavo Sainz, and they became icons of the movement; Some writers who were not part of the movement but sympathized with it were Elena Poniatowska, Gabriela Brimmer, Jose Emilio Pacheco and Octavio Paz.  La Onda in cinema and theater  La Onda had icons like Alejandro Jodorowski, the Gurrola bros. and Sergio Garc√≠a, making Super 8 film synonymous with counterculture. Iconic films which gained worldwide attention varied from the women's liberation- oriented ones like Jos√© Agust√≠n's \\"5 de chocolate y 1 de fresa\\" to Jodorowski's psychedelic avant-garde masterpiece El Topo.  La Onda in drug use and spirituality In the realm of hallucinogenic drugs, La Onda's icon was shaman Mar√≠a Sabina. Society from the Mexican Revolution to the 1970s Mexican society had undergone a tremendous change after the Mexican Revolution; a period of modernization pushed by the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). Mexican society had a great deal to do with the growth and popularity of the Mexican counterculture. \\"The country‚Äôs transformation from predominantly rural to urban, the expansion of national industries, the emergence of a mixed economy with a high profile, and the expansion of educational institutions all fostered the impression that Mexico had finally emerged from the blight of underdevelopment and was on the road to peace and prosperity\\". The PRI wanted Mexico to become an evolved and prosperous country, like the United States. As Mexican society grew more and more inspired by and connected to other foreign countries, the cultural dos and don‚Äôts became more similar to those of other countries - especially those of the United States. As rock and roll music and American television and movies, arrived in Mexico, the youth changed and slowly evolved a rebellious stage inspired by the youth rebellion of the United States. One of the major ways in which the youth of Mexico began to rebel was by listening to and performing rock and roll. At first, they would perform famous songs in English from famous English-speaking rock and rollers like Elvis Presley, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones. The Mexican government saw a chance to reach Mexican youth by supporting rock and roll music and helping Mexican musicians to play rock and roll music. The government hoped to change the meaning of the music. Instead of rebellion, the music would inspire support for the Mexican government and promote becoming upstanding citizens. But \\"government efforts to blockade the arrival of foreign music indirectly contributed to the emergence of a native rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll product and more and more rock and roll bands began to emerge.Refried, p62 Rock and roll represented a connection between the youth of Mexico, and the trend-setting youth of America. Both countries had modernized rapidly after World War II, and an effect of this modernization was a desire for a unifying identity that separate from that of past generations with a Revolutionary identity, and especially from that of their parents and grandparents fought for and brought about the Mexican Revolution. The harder the PRI tried to control the identity of Mexico‚Äôs citizens, the more the youth of Mexico felt it necessary to fight back. Mexican rock and roll bands needed a place to perform their music that was accessible to everyone. They began performing in places like Cafe Cantante, a rock club that allowed everyone to access the counter culture. The youth of Mexico identified with the youth of the United States, but unfortunately were only able to witness a small part of the American counterculture, and that in other countries, so they had to interpret and express what they saw through their music. Besides television, film, and literature, the youth of Mexico only had one true way to experience the counterculture in a unified way, and that was through music. The Cafe Cantantes \\"thus served as a kind of transcultural performance space where the styles, gestures, and sounds of the youth culture from abroad were transposed for a Mexican audience\\".Refried p100 The Mexican government felt a need to shut down the clubs because they \\"foment[ed] rebellion without a cause' leading to increases in juvenile delinquency\\". As the cafes were raided and shut down, the counterculture of the 1960s grew and was inspired to question and challenge authority. The counterculture was no longer just about rock and roll. Now, in the early 1960s, youth were also adopting foreign fashion and attitudes towards authority and rock music \\"was again becoming a wedge against traditional social values and a vehicle for free expression\\".Refried, p.102 The Mexican government was very focused on projecting cultural unity, and the youth of Mexico felt it was important to express themselves and their feelings about this rigid modernization and unification through their music and clothing. As the decade went by, hippies, or jipitecas, emerged among the youth of Mexico. Politically conscious students began to openly defy societal norms, like the hippies did in the United States. They needed to break the bonds of society and find new ways to express themselves. Young men wanted to break out of the mold set by their fathers. So they had to look disheveled and wrinkled, because the older generation of men looked very manicured and put together, and dressed much more conservatively. Girls had a similar problem, but also had to fight for a new freedom, where they had the same rights and opportunities as men. But both genders were beginning to fight for their rights to express themselves, be original, and be individual. Politics: Single-party government After the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican government worked for a time to legitimize the acts of the new Constitution and to settle the country into stabilized governance. For a time, Mexico boasted \\"high levels of popular participation, featured a wide array of opposing political parties, and observed peaceful transfers of power from one administration to the next\\". But an authoritarian government eventually emerged. \\"The combination of favorable international circumstances and internal conditions enabled the governing party to become a monopoly party of government during the three decades after 1940\\".Concise, p240 Presidents like √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, Plutarco El√≠as Calles, and L√°zaro C√°rdenas wanted to perpetuate the teachings of the Revolution and solidify revolutionary ideals into Mexican society. But after the Mexican Revolution the government not only wanted to solidify the Revolution's ideals, it also wanted to improve the government and elevate the status of Mexico to a modern, First World power. In the 1940s they began \\"to industrialize the country, by means of an import-substitution policy...displacing the traditional center of gravity, which had been the countryside, to the cities\\". This shift, and their focus on the middle-class family eventually led to the first phase of La Onda, in which the children and grandchildren of the Revolutionaries began to challenge authority and individualizing and expressing themselves through rock and roll music and foreign fashion trends. By the 1960s, the import-substitution model was no longer working. The enthusiasm with which the Mexican government had fostering towards economic growth and political stability was slowly stifling the Mexican people. In the 1950s, Northern Mexico witnessed \\"a vigorous mobilization of peasant groups that invaded lands under the direction of organizations with relatively radical ideologies, outside the official structures\\".Aguilar, p184 By the late 1960s, \\"the monopoly party had deepened its control over the political processes and took credit for the economic expansion that resulted\\".Concise, p.241 Now it was not only Mexico's middle- class youth that were rebelling against the authoritarian government. The working-class was rebelling also, against the old industrial institutions and to fighting for better pay and protection from the companies and the government. Economics: A widening gap between the middle and lower classes Mexico's economy expanded substantially after World War II. As it expanded, the country became prosperous and the population more middle class. More and more factories were built, bolstering the economy, but resulting in lower pay for workers ‚Äí the people who kept the economy afloat. Mexican politics and economy went hand in hand when \\"political stability [under √Åvila Camacho] encouraged enough foreign capital back into the country to bolster high rates of growth\\".Concise, p.243 Mexico's \\"emphasis on economic development...has focused on those activities, industry and commerce, that are most efficiently undertaken in urban areas, where there is an adequate supply of labor, credit, transportation, and communication\\". This emphasis on urbanization eventually led to the worker and student movement of the 1960s. As 1968 approached, the president of Mexico gained more and more absolute and monopolizing power. President Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz displayed the terrible effects of absolute government on the people of Mexico; \\"the issue of accountability, along with other constitutional questions such as the relationship of the powers and the effective participation of civil society in the political processes, fell by the wayside\\".Concise, p.255 The monopoly of the PRI, especially under D√≠az Ordaz, had gone unchallenged prior to the 1968 student movement, but the growth of presidential power under D√≠az was seen as blatantly abusive, inspiring students, peasants, and industrial workers to challenge his absolute authority. In 1968, Mexico City hosted the 1968 Summer Olympics. The Mexican government had been dealing with the effects of La Onda as minor social rebellions inspired by the American counterculture movement. As passive and active resistance grew, the Mexican government saw a need to put down the opposition. Ordaz felt that the Olympics were Mexico's initiation into the First World community, and that a student movement just weeks before the Games would be disastrous for Mexico's image. Mexico's economic situation improved in the 1950s with the Bracero Program and with a \\"Export-Import Bank approved $150 million loan to finance transportation, agriculture, and power facilities\\". Between 1954 and 1971, the Mexican economy stabilized under President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines and Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos. This stability lasted until 1971, when the Mexican economy began to decline. One of the major reasons for such a prosperous economy at this time was Mexico's decision to nationalize its oil production. This nationalization and Mexico's modernization program helped to stabilize the economy. Another factor was the Korean War which \\"had increased world prices, provided opportunities for Mexican exports, and led to the inflow of foreign capital\\".Concise>, p248 But by the late 1960s, the Mexican economy was unable to finance itself, resulting in lower wages and worker discontent. Social protests Before the Student Movement of 1968, there were other political movements. One such movement took place between 1964 and 1965. At that time, \\"D√≠az Ordaz‚Äôs political miscalculations allowed a dispute over better pay and working conditions with hospital doctors working in the public sector to escalate into a strike movement\\".Concise, p257 Although this strike did not have anything to do with La Onda, it did serve as an example for Mexico's youth in their fight against an authoritarian government. Besides student movements, the government also responded severely to labor unions, usually with harsh repression. In the 1930s and 1940s, the PRI used police and military force to suppress labor protests. Later, in 1958-1959, the government responded to the railway workers‚Äô dispute by arresting numerous workers and union supporters. In 1961, in Mexico City, students gathered to celebrate the newly instated Fidel Castro administration in Cuba, when the gathering was broken up by police using tear gas and rifle butts. This severe, single-minded way of dealing with social movements did not work to the Mexican government's advantage. After the 1968 Student Movement and resulting massacre, \\"an alliance of students, peasants, and urban workers in Oaxaca succeeded in forming a political movement independent of the PRI by 1972\\". Throughout the time of Mexico's economic stability under the PRI, there were many minor protests to question the moral credibility of the Mexican government. 1968 Student Movement and the Tlatelolco Massacre For a long time, the Mexican government had been pushing the Mexican people into a unified structure, one where the youth of Mexico did not rebel and the entire population worked together to recreate Mexico as a First World power. This forced and false unity inspired the Mexican counterculture. The youth of Mexico saw other countries protesting their own false unification, and craved the individuality that those protestors had found. This challenge to authority manifested in the rock and roll music and clothing in the everyday lives of Mexico's adolescents. And just as the students in other countries peacefully protested conservative governments, the students of Mexico begin to challenge authority in Mexico too. Gilberto Guevara Niebla, a student leader, stated in an interview: \\"The Student Movement had many dimensions. On one hand, it was a student movement; on the other, it was not. The Student movement was the bearer of demands that were not only strictly student concerns but those of the society. Before 1968, the authoritarian state had brutally beaten workers, also campesinos, and it had destroyed the leftist opposition parties. It was in this vacuum, that students injected their demands, aspirations, and desires that were not exclusively of student interest, but also of interest to campesinos, workers, intellectuals, political parts, etc.\\". The 1968 student movement was the \\"articulated restlessness and rage for much of the youth of a middle class which had come of age during Mexico‚Äôs acclaimed modernizing 'miracle' and which afterward opened the floodgates of cynicism and everyday resistance to a political system bent on maintaining control\\".Refried, page=2 According to Zolov, the student movement made only six demands, including \\"freedom of political prisoners, abolition of the riot police, the dismissal of the Mexico City chief of police, and justice against those responsible for repression\\".Refried, 121 The 1968 student movement wasn't just students; peasants, businessmen and Mexico's working class also took part the fight for democracy. In 1968, the student movement \\"challenged the legitimacy of the system and proved, by the bloody repression it suffered, that [the Mexican Government] had an authoritarian core\\".Aguilar, p165 Protesters wanted a mass movement that would force the government to reform the official party and provide greater opportunity for political participation. Economic growth after World War II and the stability that ensued led to overall declines in poverty and inequality, but the \\"opportunities created for the middle sectors did not match their expectations and instead created a large population of upwardly mobile young people whose dreams and aspirations\\" grew faster than the Mexican economy. The younger generation was still inspired by foreign protests against rigid government regimes. Through literature, music, and art, Mexico's youth connected and amassed into a larger group that included students, peasants and industrial workers. They began to challenge the status quo and question authority, seeking self-expression and equality for all. Across Mexico, more and more universities got involved, students began to meet and address issues and hold rallies protesting world events and injustice in Mexico. As more and more campuses joined in, the government became uncomfortable and paranoid about the effect the students would have on Mexico's reputation. It began to monitor politically active students, but the more the government monitored students, the more they joined the cause. By late 1968, even some high schools and middle schools had joined the student movement. No longer was the younger generation fighting against conservative family values with rock and roll music, beatnik literature, and daring fashion. Now, the students were unifying and banding together in resentment of an authoritarian government. Mexico had been selected to host the 1968 Olympic Games, and the PRI were on high alert for student protests. They were not tolerant. Students played a key role in the democratization of the Mexican government; as police abuse became more and more prevalent, students began to feel that political upheaval was needed. On July 29, 1968, \\"students barricaded themselves inside their high school to protest police abuse\\" then \\"infantry troops used a bazooka to blast\\" into the school and \\"proceeded to beat and ultimately arrest one thousand students\\". This and many other cases of police abuse triggered an ultimate student protest on October 2, 1968. Internally, the 1968 student movement was linked to \\"the growing criticism of the Mexican Revolution that was particularly evident in the labor struggles of the 1950s and 1960s\\". The political movements of other countries and their success in changing legislation inspired the revolutionary youth. The Mexican youth thought that if they peacefully banded together and showed their support for their cause, the PRI might heed their demands. On July 26, 1968, demonstrators attempted to gather at the Z√≥calo, which was reserved for organized demonstrations of support for the president. As more and more people gathered, D√≠az Ordaz \\"regarded the movement as an affront to the dignity of Mexico\\".Concise, p260). The PRI had no control over student demands for respect and constitutional rights. By August 13, 1968, \\"100,000 people were protesting against the regime‚Äôs disrespect for public liberties and the presence of tanks in the city streets\\".Concise, p260 The government saw the growing political unrest as \\"a revolutionary conspiracy...designed to bring down the existing political order\\".Concise, p260 People gathered on the evening of October 2, 1968, at the Plaza de las Tres Culturas (Plaza of Three Cultures). The administration made no attempt to establish dialogue. Troops and police opened fire on the Tlatelolco demonstrators and massacred them. This massacre at Tlatelolco \\"which effectively terminated the protest movement\\". There was a call for a new counter-movement and new forms of opposition to the authoritarian government.Concise, p260 Now, the student movement had turned into La Onda, a new movement focused solely on expressing a deep need for democracy in Mexico, as well as the need for self-expression. The massacre \\"created a legitimacy\\" for democratization ‚Äí no longer could the Mexican government deny that Mexico had an authoritarian government.Trevizo, p57 Not only did the massacre \\"reorganize civil society and catalyze electoral reforms\\", it also \\"spotlighted Mexican authoritarianism\\".Trevizo, p58 After the Massacre at Tlatelolco, La Onda evolved again. First it had been a protestation of conservative traditions legitimized during the Mexican Revolution. This youth movement questioned authority through the use of rock and roll music, beatnik literature, and daring fashion. Next came the Student Movements that challenged the authoritarian government and fought for the democratization of Mexico. After the Tlatelolco Massacre, a new wave of La Onda emerged ‚Äí that of the jipitecas, or hippies, who rebelled against the status quo and preached peace and democracy above a strict authoritarianism government. Festival Rock y Ruedas de Av√°ndaro The Festival Rock y Ruedas in Av√°ndaro, Mexico, took place September 11‚Äì12, 1971 in the hamlet of Tenantongo, near the Avandaro lake and golf club in Valle de Bravo, State of Mexico. The Rock y Ruedas (Rock and Wheels) festival had originally begun as \\"nothing more than a series of auto races\\". The organizers suggested that rock music should be included to have a Noche Mexicana the night before the event. As many bands were hired to participate, a rock festival was organized to promote the auto race ‚Äí but instead turned into a \\"Mexican Woodstock\\" with a huge number of Mexican rock bands such as Los Dug Dug's, El Epilogo, La Division Del Norte, Tequila, Peace and Love, El Ritual and so many more playing to a crowd of over 300,000 people for two days. This huge music spectacle culminated all the effort of La Onda, describing \\"a modern sense of movement and communication, as in radio or television 'wavelength'\\".Refried, page=113 The festival, which greatly resembled the Woodstock of the United States, was a culmination of the efforts of La Onda along with the efforts of the government to control political unrest and make the public feel as though their protests were heard. La Onda, which had started as a teenage rebellion against conservative parenting, had turned into a political movement fighting for democracy in an authoritarian government, and lastly returned to a musical demonstration, but instead of violently rebelling against authority, it taught passive resistance, peace, and unification.

A novel of manners is work of fiction that re-creates a social world, conveying with finely detailed observation the customs, values, and mores of a highly developed and complex society. The conventions of the society dominate the story, and characters are differentiated by the degree to which they measure up to the uniform standard, or ideal, of behaviour or fall below it. The scope of a novel of manners may be particular, as in the works of Jane Austen, which deal with the domestic affairs of the English landed gentry of the 19th century, or general, as in the novels of Balzac, which mirror the 19th century in stories dealing with Parisian life, provincial life, private life, public life, and military life. Notable writers of the novel of manners from the end of the 19th century into the 20th include Henry James, Evelyn Waugh, Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, and John Marquand.https://www.britannica.com/art/novel-of-manners Background The illustrated title-pages of volume II, Fourth Edition of the novel Evelina: Or the History of a Young Lady's Entrance into the World (1779), by Frances Burney. Books and notes in this period instructing one how to behave in society are countless. In particular, Lord Chesterfield's letters to his son are a prime example to anyone concerned with propriety. He instructs his son to engage society in a pleasing manner which includes avoiding possibly offensive or controversial subjects, speaking in peaceful tones, and acquiring a poised posture, all in consideration of the company one is in. This obsession with proper social conduct spawned a wave of novels concerned with this sort of behaviour. In 1778, Frances Burney wrote Evelina, a novel whose innovative plot and treatment of contemporary manners made it a landmark in the development of the novel of manners.Britannica Educational Publishing (2010). English Literature from the Restoration through the Romantic Period, pp. 108-09. Social behaviour in public and private settings accounts for much of the plot of Evelina. This is mirrored in other novels that were more highly popularised in the beginning of the 19th century. Jane Austen's novels are perhaps the most recognisable works in the genre. Because of Austen's works, the novel of manners is mostly associated with the early 19th century. Relation to Gothic fiction The rise in the importance of social behaviour had not gone unnoticed by one Horace Walpole, the widely credited inventor of Gothic fiction. Walpole's knowledge of Chesterfield and the importance of manners perhaps influenced not only his work but carried over into other authors' novels dubbed \\"Gothic\\" as well. Walpole wrote what is generally accepted to be the first Gothic novel during Chesterfield's lifetime, The Castle of Otranto in 1764. It is theorised that the emergence of the novel of manners as a full genre was in retaliation to the rise in the popularity of the Gothic novel. This near-simultaneous emergence of the novel of manners and the Gothic novel led to a crossover of characteristics between the genres. The main link between the novel of manners and the Gothic novel is the language of manners. In both cases, social and moral manners are dominating factors in the structure of the novel. In the Gothic novel, the starkest difference is the supernatural or the indication of supernatural events. However, many of the characters are often so far below the accepted level of social behaviour that it is considered horrific. Another feature that differs from the novel of manners is the outcome of the novel. In Gothic fiction, the outcome is not always the positive reinforcement of morals that the novel of manners offers. An example of this morally anti-climactic ending would be Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya. Another theory for the emergence and growth of the novel of manners is that the changes taking place in English society were eroding the class boundaries. Changes in the social hierarchy were taking place due to leaps in technology and the novel of manners was a way to comment upon challenges to the traditional class order. The different classes represented in the novels served to represent how the different classes in society were supposed to behave in different settings. This includes public versus private, rural versus urban, and settings where there were men versus women. This contrast between the genders highlights the fact that there were many more women that were authors of novels of manners than there were men. This brought the focus of many of these novels to the social issues and conventions that plagued women of the time.  Notable works  Novels of manners in English include: ;18th century *The Man of Feeling (1771), by Henry Mackenzie *Evelina (1778), and Camilla (1796), by Fanny Burney ;19th century *Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), Emma (1816), and Persuasion (1818), by Jane Austen *Vanity Fair: A Novel Without a Hero (1848), by William Makepeace Thackeray *North and South (1855), and Wives and Daughters (1864), by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell *The Mill on the Floss (1860), and Silas Marner (1861), by George Eliot ;20th century *The House of Mirth (1905) and The Age of Innocence (1920), by Edith Wharton *A Handful of Dust (1937), by Evelyn Waugh  See also  * Comedy of manners Notes  References  * *Novel Beginnings: Experiments in 18th century English Fiction Patricia Meyer Spacks Yale Guides to English Literature U.S. 2006 *Lord Chesterfield's Letters Lord Chesterfield, Introduction and Notes by David Roberts Oxford University Press Great Clarendon Street, Oxford 1992 *The Castle of Otranto Horace Walpole Oxford University Press Great Clarendon Street, Oxford 1996 *Zofloya Charlotte Dacre Oxford University Press Great Clarendon Street, Oxford 1997 *Evelina Frances Burney Oxford University Press Great Clarendon Street, Oxford 2006 *http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2186248/A-BRIEF-HISTORY-OF-THE-NOVEL/ *http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Sentimental_novel Category:Literary genres ","title":"Novel of manners"},{"id":"11848017","text":"Manodu is a Telugu film, Cinematography by T. Surendra Reddy directed by Priyadarshini Ram. It is the first film directed by Priyadarshini Ram. The film was released on 24 February 2006. Plot The film narrates the story of a young man Viswam (Bharat) who rises from utter poverty to riches, by unfair means like charging commission from creditors for recovering their loans, though advised against it by his parents and friends. All that he treats as important is money and thinks that there is nothing he cannot achieve with money. Saying so, he walks out of home. What kind of problems he and his like- minded friends face is the subject of the film. These friends work under the leadership of one Raghu (Priyadarshini Ram). Obviously they are in a 'dandha', a name often used for collecting money by force to enjoy life. 'Mirchi' - a girl with a story of her own behind her, lives with Ram and half a dozen members of the dandha, two of whom are girls. Most of the dialogues in these scenes show their wayward behavior and carefree life. Their solutions to problems too are strange. When a girl is gang raped ‚Äì as the young man pretending love for her takes her to a room to rape her, ten others in the room too rape her - the leader orders that the one who pretended love for the girl to marry her. This he feels will be a punishment for the young man because it would make him suffer as he would recall every day what he had done to her. There are many such other strange punishments. But not always do the members of the dandha display this kind of social consciousness and sense of justice. They charge huge sums for settling issues. Even the police department and its high officials are at beck and call of this gang. A rival gang starts functioning. They await a chance to wipe off this gang. They get the chance when Viswam falls in love with a girl (Radhika). He is the son of a schoolteacher, respected by persons from all sections of life ‚Äì right from the police to the bureaucracy. When the police arrest Viswam, the father to get him released, runs from pillar to post only to learn in the end how bad his son is, and how he extracts money from others. He is a disappointed man and dies of a heart attack. The commissioner of police,(Nayaz) also a student of the teacher, helps his son's release. This begins the destruction of the network he works for and his realization that this kind of negative approach would never be acceptable to society.

Ambroise Par√©, a 16th-century French surgeon, stated that to perform surgery is, \\"To eliminate that which is superfluous, restore that which has been dislocated, separate that which has been united, join that which has been divided and repair the defects of nature.\\" Since humans first learned to make and handle tools, they have employed their talents to develop surgical techniques, each time more sophisticated than the last; however, until the industrial revolution, surgeons were incapable of overcoming the three principal obstacles which had plagued the medical profession from its infancy ‚Äî bleeding, pain and infection. Advances in these fields have transformed surgery from a risky \\"art\\" into a scientific discipline capable of treating many diseases and conditions. Origins The first surgical techniques were developed to treat injuries and traumas. The first surgical procedures were carried out by Sushruta in India around 2000BC according to texts. There are many surgical and ayurvedic texts written by him in Sanskrit whose copies can be found in the museums of Britain and India. He is also called the father of modern surgery. Sushruta performed surgeries like nose repair, intestinal repairs, plastic surgery etc. in ancient times. A combination of archaeological and anthropological studies offer insight into man's early techniques for suturing lacerations, amputating unsalvageable limbs, and draining and cauterizing open wounds. Many examples exist: some Asian tribes used a mix of saltpeter and sulfur that was placed onto wounds and lit on fire to cauterize wounds; the Dakota people used the quill of a feather attached to an animal bladder to suck out purulent material; the discovery of needles from the stone age seem to suggest they were used in the suturing of cuts (the Maasai used needles of acacia for the same purpose); and tribes in India and South America developed an ingenious method of sealing minor injuries by applying termites or scarabs who bit the edges of the wound and then twisted the insects' neck, leaving their heads rigidly attached like staples.W. J. Bishop, The early history of Surgery. Hale, London, 1960 =Trepanation= The oldest operation for which evidence exists is trepanation(Capasso 2001) (also known as trepanning, trephination, trephining or burr hole from Greek œÑœÅœçœÄŒ±ŒΩŒøŒΩ and œÑœÅœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ), in which a hole is drilled or scraped into the skull for exposing the dura mater to treat health problems related to intracranial pressure and other diseases. In the case of head wounds, surgical intervention was implemented for investigating and diagnosing the nature of the wound and the extent of the impact while bone splinters were removed preferably by scraping followed by post operation procedures and treatments for avoiding infection and aiding in the healing process.A.

Among some treatments used by the Aztecs, according to Spanish texts during the conquest of Mexico, was the reduction of fractured bones: \\"...the broken bone had to be splinted, extended and adjusted, and if this was not sufficient an incision was made at the end of the bone, and a branch of fir was inserted into the cavity of the medulla...\\"Lucena SM.

Leeches for bloodletting Bloodletting is one of the oldest medical practices, having been practiced among diverse ancient peoples, including the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians, the Greeks, the Mayans, and the Aztecs. In Greece, bloodletting was in use around the time of Hippocrates, who mentions bloodletting but in general relied on dietary techniques. Erasistratus, however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood, and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by exercise, sweating, reduced food intake, and vomiting. Herophilus advocated bloodletting. Archagathus, one of the first Greek physicians to practice in Rome, practiced bloodletting extensively. The art of bloodletting became very popular in the West, and during the Renaissance one could find bloodletting calendars that recommended appropriate times to bloodlet during the year and books that claimed bloodletting would cure inflammation, infections, strokes, manic psychosis and more.http://ciruelo.uninorte.edu.co/pdf/salud_uninorte/16/1.la_sangria.pdf Antiquity =Mesopotamia= The Sumerians saw sickness as a divine punishment imposed by different demons when an individual broke a rule. For this reason, to be a physician, one had to learn to identify approximately 6,000 possible demons that might cause health problems. To do this, the Sumerians employed divining techniques based on the flight of birds, position of the stars and the livers of certain animals. In this way, medicine was intimately linked to priests, relegating surgery to a second-class medical specialty.La historia empieza en Sumer. Samuel Noah Kramer, C√≠rculo de lectores, 1975 Nevertheless, the Sumerians developed several important medical techniques: in Ninevah archaeologists have discovered bronze instruments with sharpened obsidian resembling modern day scalpels, knives, trephines, etc. The Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest Babylonian code of laws, itself contains specific legislation regulating surgeons and medical compensation as well as malpractice and victim's compensation:Codex Hammurabi =Egypt= Pictures of surgery tools at Kom Ombo, Egypt Around 3100 BCE Egyptian civilization began to flourish when Narmer, the first Pharaoh of Egypt, established the capital of Memphis. Just as cuneiform tablets preserved the knowledge of the ancient Sumerians, hieroglyphics preserved the Egyptians'. In the first monarchic age (2700 BCE) the first treatise on surgery was written by Imhotep, the vizier of Pharaoh Djoser, priest, astronomer, physician and first notable architect. So much was he famed for his medical skill that he became the Egyptian god of medicine.La√≠n Entralgo P: Historia de la Medicina. Salvat. Barcelona, 1982. Other famous physicians from the Ancient Empire (from 2500 to 2100 BCE) were Sachmet, the physician of Pharaoh Sahure and Nesmenau, whose office resembled that of a medical director. On one of the doorjambs of the entrance to the Temple of Memphis there is the oldest recorded engraving of a medical procedure: circumcision and engravings in Kom Ombo, Egypt depict surgical tools. Still of all the discoveries made in ancient Egypt, the most important discovery relating to ancient Egyptian knowledge of medicine is the Ebers Papyrus, named after its discoverer Georg Ebers. The Ebers Papyrus, conserved at the University of Leipzig, is considered one of the oldest treaties on medicine and the most important medical papyri. The text is dated to about 1550 BCE and measures 20 meters in length. The text includes recipes, a pharmacopoeia and descriptions of numerous diseases as well as cosmetic treatments. It mentions how to surgically treat crocodile bites and serious burns, recommending the drainage of pus-filled inflammation but warns against certain diseased skin. Edwin Smith Papyrus Plates vi and vii of the Edwin Smith Papyrus (around the 17th century BC), among the earliest medical texts The Edwin Smith Papyrus is a lesser known papyrus dating from the 1600 BCE and only 5 meters in length. It is a manual for performing traumatic surgery and gives 48 case histories. The Smith Papyrus describes a treatment for repairing a broken nose, and the use of sutures to close wounds.R. Sullivan, \\"The Identity and Work of the Ancient Egyptian Surgeon\\". Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine. 89, no 8 (1996): 469. Infections were treated with honey.James P. Allen, \\"The Art of Medicine in Ancient Egypt\\". (New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005), 72. For example, it gives instructions for dealing with a dislocated vertebra: =India= Archaeologists made the discovery that the people of Indus Valley Civilization, even from the early Harappan periods (c. 3300 BCE), had knowledge of medicine and dentistry. The physical anthropologist that carried out the examinations, Professor Andrea Cucina from the University of Missouri-Columbia, made the discovery when he was cleaning the teeth from one of the men. Later research in the same area found evidence of teeth having been drilled, dating back 9,000 years to 7000 BCE.BBC News Stone age man used dentist drill Sushruta (c. 600 BCE) is considered as the \\"founding father of surgery\\". His period is usually placed between the period of 1200 BC - 600 BC. One of the earliest known mention of the name is from the Bower Manuscript where Sushruta is listed as one of the ten sages residing in the Himalayas.Kutumbian, pages XXXII-XXXIII Texts also suggest that he learned surgery at Kasi from Lord Dhanvantari, the god of medicine in Hindu mythology.Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit Dictionary, s.v. \\"su≈õruta\\" He was an early innovator of plastic surgery who taught and practiced surgery on the banks of the Ganges in the area that corresponds to the present day city of Varanasi in Northern India. Much of what is known about Sushruta is in Sanskrit contained in a series of volumes he authored, which are collectively known as the Sushruta Samhita. It is one of the oldest known surgical texts and it describes in detail the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments, as well as procedures on performing various forms of cosmetic surgery, plastic surgery and rhinoplasty.History of plastic surgery in India. Rana RE, Arora BS, - J Postgrad Med =Greece and the Hellenized world= Engraving of Hippocrates by Peter Paul Rubens, 1638. Surgeons are now considered to be specialized physicians, whereas in the early ancient Greek world a trained general physician had to use his hands (œáŒµŒØœÅ in Greek) to carry out all medical and medicinal processes including for example the treating of wounds sustained on the battlefield, or the treatment of broken bones (a process called in Greek: œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÖœÅŒ≥ŒµŒØŒΩ). In The Iliad Homer names two doctors, ‚Äúthe two sons of Asklepios, the admirable physicians Podaleirius and Machaon and one acting doctor, Patroclus. Because Machaon is wounded and Podaleirius is in combat Eurypylus asks Patroclus ‚Äúto cut out this arrow from my thigh, wash off the blood with warm water and spread soothing ointment on the wound.\\" Hippocrates The Hippocratic Oath,Hippocrates, The Oath, Vol. I, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard, 2004, pp. 298‚àí301 written in the 5th century BC provides the earliest protocol for professional conduct and ethical behavior a young physician needed to abide by in life and in treating and managing the health and privacy of his patients. The multiple volumes of the Hippocratic corpusHippocrates, Vol. I-VIII, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard, 2004 and the Hippocratic Oath elevated and separated the standards of proper Hippocratic medical conduct and its fundamental medical and surgical principles from other practitioners of folk medicine often laden with superstitious constructs, and/or of specialists of sorts some of whom would endeavor to carry out invasive body procedures with dubious consequences, such as lithotomy. Works from the Hippocratic corpus include; On the Articulations or On Joints, On Fractures, On the Instruments of Reduction, The Physician's Establishment or Surgery, On Injuries of the Head, On Ulcers, On Fistulae, and On Hemorrhoids.  Celsus and Alexandria  Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Ceos were two great Alexandrians who laid the foundations for the scientific study of anatomy and physiology. Alexandrian surgeons were responsible for developments in ligature (hemostasis), lithotomy, hernia operations, ophthalmic surgery, plastic surgery, methods of reduction of dislocations and fractures, tracheotomy, and mandrake as anesthesia. Most of what we know of them comes from Celsus and Galen of Pergamum (Greek: ŒìŒ±ŒªŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ)Galen, On the Natural Faculties, Books I, II, and III, Loeb Classical Library, Harvard, 2000 Galen Galen's On the Natural Faculties, Books I, II, and III, is an excellent paradigm of a very accomplished Greek surgeon and physician of the 2nd century Roman era, who carried out very complex surgical operations and added significantly to the corpus of animal and human physiology and the art of surgery. He was one of the first to use ligatures in his experiments on animals. Galen is also known as \\"The king of the catgut suture\\" =China= In China, instruments resembling surgical tools have also been found in the archaeological sites of Bronze Age dating from the Shang Dynasty, along with seeds likely used for herbalism. Hua Tuo Woodblock printing by Utagawa Kuniyoshi of Hua Tuo Hua Tuo (140‚Äì208) was a famous Chinese physician during the Eastern Han and Three Kingdoms era. He was the first person to perform surgery with the aid of anesthesia, some 1600 years before the practice was adopted by Europeans.Sherer, Adina; Epstein, Fred; and Constantini, Shlomi; \\"Hua Tuo, patron of surgeons, or how the surgeon lost his head!\\" Surgical Neurology, 61 5 497‚Äì498 (2004).Bian Que (Pien Ch'iao) was a \\"miracle doctor\\" described by the Chinese historian Sima Qian in his Shiji who was credited with many skills. Another book, Liezi (Lieh Tzu) describes that Bian Que conducted a two way exchange of hearts between people.Kahan BD. Pien Ch'iao, the legendary exchange of hearts, traditional Chinese medicine, and the modern era of cyclosporine. Transplant Proc. 1988 Apr;20(2 Suppl 2):2-12. This account also credited Bian Que with using general anaesthesia which would place it far before Hua Tuo, but the source in Liezi is questioned and the author may have been compiling stories from other works.Graham, A.C. \\"The Date and Composition of Liehtzyy,\\" Asia Major 8, pp. 139‚àí198. 1961. Nonetheless, it establishes the concept of heart transplantation back to around 300 CE. Middle Ages Paul of Aegina's (c. 625 ‚Äì c. 690 CE) Pragmateia or Compendiem was highly influential. Abulcasis Al-Zahrawi of the Islamic Golden Age later repeated the material, largely verbatim. Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809‚Äì873) was an Arab Nestorian Christian physician who translated many Greek medical and scientific texts, including those of Galen, writing the first systematic treatment of ophthalmology. Egypt-born Jewish physician Isaac Israeli ben Solomon (832‚Äì892) also left many medical works written in Arabic that were translated and adopted by European universities in the early 13th century. Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854‚Äì925), \\"the Islamic Hippocrates\\" advanced experimental medicine, pioneering ophthalmology and founding pediatrics. Persian physician Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi (d. 994) worked at the Al-Adudi Hospital in Baghdad, leaving The Complete Book of the Medical Art, which stressed the need for medical ethics and discussed the anatomy and physiology of the human brain. Persian physician Avicenna (980‚Äì1037) wrote The Canon of Medicine, a synthesis of Greek and Arab medicine that dominated European medicine until the mid-17th century. In the 9th century the Medical School of Salerno in southwest Italy was founded, making use of Arabic texts and flourishing through the 13th century. Abulcasis (936‚Äì1013) (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi) was an Andalusian-Arab physician and scientist who practised in the Zahra suburb of Cordoba. He is considered to be the greatest medieval surgeon, though he added little to Greek surgical practices. His works on surgery were highly influential. African-born Italian Benedictine monk (Muslim convert) Constantine the African (died 1099) of Monte Cassino translated many Arabic medical works into Latin. Spanish Muslim physician Avenzoar (1094‚Äì1162) performed the first tracheotomy on a goat, writing Book of Simplification on Therapeutics and Diet, which became popular in Europe. Spanish Muslim physician Averroes (1126‚Äì1198) was the first to explain the function of the retina and to recognize acquired immunity with smallpox. Universities such as Montpellier, Padua and Bologna were particularly renowned. In the late 12th century Rogerius Salernitanus composed his Chirurgia, laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. Roland of Parma and Surgery of the Four Masters were responsible for spreading Roger's work to Italy, France, and England. Roger seems to have been influenced more by the 6th-century A√´tius and Alexander of Tralles, and the 7th-century Paul of Aegina, than by the Arabs. Hugh of Lucca (1150‚àí1257) founded the Bologna School and rejected the theory of \\"laudable pus\\". In the 13th century in Europe skilled town craftsmen called barber-surgeons performed amputations and set broken bones while suffering lower status than university educated doctors. By 1308 the Worshipful Company of Barbers in London was flourishing. With little or no formal training, they generally had a bad reputation that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine rather than an accessory field in the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. Guy de Chauliac (1298‚Äì1368) was one of the most eminent surgeons of the Middle Ages. His Chirurgia Magna or Great Surgery (1363) was a standard text for surgeons until well into the seventeenth century.\\"Peter Elmer, Ole Peter Grell (2004). \\"Health, disease, and society in Europe, 1500‚Äì1800: a source book\\". Manchester University Press. p.8. Early modern Europe Andreas Vesalius (1514‚Äì1564) Ambroise Par√© (c. 1510‚Äì1590), father of modern military surgery. Wilhelm Fabry (1540‚Äì1634), father of German surgery There were some important advances to the art of surgery during this period. Andreas Vesalius (1514‚Äì1564), professor of anatomy at the University of Padua was a pivotal figure in the Renaissance transition from classical medicine and anatomy based on the works of Galen, to an empirical approach of 'hands-on' dissection. His anatomic treatise De humani corporis fabrica exposed many anatomical errors in Galen and advocated that all surgeons should train by engaging in practical dissections themselves. The second figure of importance in this era was Ambroise Par√© (sometimes spelled \\"Ambrose\\" (c. 1510 ‚Äì 1590)), a French army surgeon from the 1530s until his death in 1590. The practice for cauterizing gunshot wounds on the battlefield had been to use boiling oil, an extremely dangerous and painful procedure. Par√© began to employ a less irritating emollient, made of egg yolk, rose oil and turpentine. He also described more efficient techniques for the effective ligation of the blood vessels during an amputation. In the same century, Eleno de C√©spedes became perhaps the first female (if not intersex or transgender) surgeon in Spain, and perhaps in Europe.R. Carrillo-Esper et al., Elena de C√©spedes: The eventful life of a XVI century surgeon, in the Gaceta M√©dica de M√©xico, 2015, 151:502-6.Emilio Maganto Pav√≥n, El proceso inquisitorial contra Elena/o de C√©spedes. Biograf√≠a de una cirujana transexual del siglo XVI, Madrid, 2007.Francisco Vazquez Garcia, Sex, Identity and Hermaphrodites in Iberia, 1500‚Äì1800 (2015, ), page 46. Another important early figure was German surgeon Wilhelm Fabry (1540‚Äì1634), \\"the Father of German Surgery\\", who was the first to recommend amputation above the gangrenous area, and to describe a windlass (twisting stick) tourniquet. His Swiss wife and assistant Marie Colinet (1560‚Äì1640 improved the techniques for Caesarean Section, introducing the use of heat for dilating and stimulating the uterus during labor. In 1624 she became the first to use a magnet to remove metal from a patient's eye, although he received the credit. Modern surgery =Scientific surgery= John Hunter (1728‚Äì1793), father of modern scientific surgery Benjamin Bell (1749‚Äì1806) by Sir Henry Raeburn. c1780 The discipline of surgery was put on a sound, scientific footing during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe (1715‚Äì89). An important figure in this regard was the Scottish surgical scientist (in London) John Hunter (1728‚Äì1793), generally regarded as the father of modern scientific surgery. He brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine the truth of the matter. To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans. Hunter greatly advanced knowledge of venereal disease and introduced many new techniques of surgery, including new methods for repairing damage to the Achilles tendon and a more effective method for applying ligature of the arteries in case of an aneurysm. He was also one of the first to understand the importance of pathology, the danger of the spread of infection and how the problem of inflammation of the wound, bone lesions and even tuberculosis often undid any benefit that was gained from the intervention. He consequently adopted the position that all surgical procedures should be used only as a last resort. Hunter's student Benjamin Bell (1749‚Äì1806) became the first scientific surgeon in Scotland, advocating the routine use of opium in post-operative recovery, and counseling surgeons to \\"save skin\\" to speed healing; his great-grandson Joseph Bell (1837‚Äì1911) became the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's literary hero Sherlock Holmes. Percivall Pott (1714‚Äì1788), engraved from an original picture by Nathaniel Dance-Holland, National Library of Medicine, Images from the History of Medicine. Other important 18th- and early 19th-century surgeons included Percival Pott (1714‚Äì1788), who first described tuberculosis of the spine and first demonstrated that a cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen after he noticed a connection between chimney sweep's exposure to soot and their high incidence of scrotal cancer. Astley Paston Cooper (1768‚Äì1841) first performed a successful ligation of the abdominal aorta. James Syme (1799‚Äì1870) pioneered the Symes Amputation for the ankle joint and successfully carried out the first hip disarticulation. Dutch surgeon Antonius Mathijsen invented the Plaster of Paris cast in 1851. =Anesthesia= Crawford Long (1815‚Äì1878) James Young Simpson (1811‚Äì1870) John Snow (1813‚Äì1858) Modern pain control through anesthesia was discovered in the mid-19th century. Before the advent of anesthesia, surgery was a traumatically painful procedure and surgeons were encouraged to be as swift as possible to minimize patient suffering. This also meant that operations were largely restricted to amputations and external growth removals. Beginning in the 1840s, surgery began to change dramatically in character with the discovery of effective and practical anaesthetic chemicals such as ether, first used by the American surgeon Crawford Long (1815‚Äì1878), and chloroform, discovered by James Young Simpson (1811‚Äì1870) and later pioneered in England by John Snow (1813‚Äì1858), physician to Queen Victoria, who in 1853 administered chloroform to her during childbirth, and in 1854 disproved the miasma theory of contagion by tracing a cholera outbreak in London to an infected water pump. In addition to relieving patient suffering, anaesthesia allowed more intricate operations in the internal regions of the human body. In addition, the discovery of muscle relaxants such as curare allowed for safer applications. American surgeon J. Marion Sims (1813‚Äì83) received credit for helping found Gynecology, but later was criticized for failing to use anesthesia on African test subjects. =Antiseptic surgery= Joseph Lister, pioneer of antiseptic surgery. The introduction of anesthetics encouraged more surgery, which inadvertently caused more dangerous patient post-operative infections. The concept of infection was unknown until relatively modern times. The first progress in combating infection was made in 1847 by the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who noticed that medical students fresh from the dissecting room were causing excess maternal death compared to midwives. Semmelweis, despite ridicule and opposition, introduced compulsory handwashing for everyone entering the maternal wards and was rewarded with a plunge in maternal and fetal deaths, however the Royal Society dismissed his advice. Until the pioneering work of British surgeon Joseph Lister in the 1860s, most medical men believed that chemical damage from exposures to bad air (see \\"miasma\\") was responsible for infections in wounds, and facilities for washing hands or a patient's wounds were not available. Lister became aware of the work of French chemist Louis Pasteur, who showed that rotting and fermentation could occur under anaerobic conditions if micro- organisms were present. Pasteur suggested three methods to eliminate the micro-organisms responsible for gangrene: filtration, exposure to heat, or exposure to chemical solutions. Lister confirmed Pasteur's conclusions with his own experiments and decided to use his findings to develop antiseptic techniques for wounds. As the first two methods suggested by Pasteur were inappropriate for the treatment of human tissue, Lister experimented with the third, spraying carbolic acid on his instruments. He found that this remarkably reduced the incidence of gangrene and he published his results in The Lancet. The Lancet, \\"On a new method of treating compound fracture, abscess, etc.: with observation on the conditions of suppuration\\". 5 articles running from: Volume 89, Issue 2272, 16 March 1867, Pages 326‚Äì329 (Originally published as Volume 1, Issue 2272) to: Volume 90, Issue 2291, 27 July 1867, Pages 95-96 Originally published as Volume 2, Issue 2291 Later, on 9 August 1867, he read a paper before the British Medical Association in Dublin, on the Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery, which was reprinted in The British Medical Journal.. Reprinted in Modernized version of text E-text, audio at Project Gutenberg. His work was groundbreaking and laid the foundations for a rapid advance in infection control that saw modern antiseptic operating theatres widely used within 50 years. Lister continued to develop improved methods of antisepsis and asepsis when he realised that infection could be better avoided by preventing bacteria from getting into wounds in the first place. This led to the rise of sterile surgery. Lister instructed surgeons under his responsibility to wear clean gloves and wash their hands in 5% carbolic solution before and after operations, and had surgical instruments washed in the same solution.Metcalfe, Peter; Metcalfe, Roger (2006). Engineering Studies: Year 11. Glebe, N.S.W.: Pascal Press. p. 151. . Retrieved 2014-07-07. He also introduced the steam steriliser to sterilize equipment. His discoveries paved the way for a dramatic expansion to the capabilities of the surgeon; for his contributions he is often regarded as the father of modern surgery. These three crucial advances - the adoption of a scientific methodology toward surgical operations, the use of anaesthetic and the introduction of sterilised equipment - laid the groundwork for the modern invasive surgical techniques of today. In the late 19th century William Stewart Halstead (1852‚Äì1922) laid out basic surgical principles for asepsis known as Halsteads principles. Halsted also introduced the latex medical glove. After one of his nurses suffered skin damage due to having to sterilize her hands with carbolic acid, Halsted had a rubber glove that could be dipped in carbolic acid designed. =X-rays= Wilhelm Roentgen (1845‚Äì1925) The use of X-rays as an important medical diagnostic tool began with their discovery in 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm R√∂ntgen. He noticed that these rays could penetrate the skin, allowing the skeletal structure to be captured on a specially treated photographic plate. =Modern technologies= In the past century, a number of technologies have had a significant impact on surgical practice. These include Electrosurgery in the early 20th century, practical Endoscopy beginning in the 1960s, and Laser surgery, Computer-assisted surgery and Robotic surgery, developed in the 1980s.

He \\"taught that wounds should be washed in water that had been boiled or filtered, and that a doctor's hands should be kept clean, his nails clipped short.\\" He became the first to distinguish benign from malignant breast tumors, advocating withholding treatment for \\"hidden\\" cancers, claiming that surgical intervention causes \\"a speedy death, but to omit treatment is to prolong life.\\" \\\\---C.E.-- * 50. About this time Roman physician-surgeon Aulus Cornelius Celsus died, leaving De Medicina, which described the \\"dilated tortuous veins\\" surrounding a breast cancer, causing Galen to later give cancer (Latin for crab) its name. He advised against radical mastectomy involving the pectoral muscles, and warned that surgery should only be attempted in the benign stage (first of four). * 1st/2nd century CE. Soranus of Ephesus wrote a 4-volume treatise on gynaecology. * 200. About this year Galen died after pioneering the use of catgut for suturing while clinging to Hippocrates Four Temperaments theory, viewing pus as beneficial, and viewing cancer as a result of melancholia caused by an excess of black bile, proven by its frequent occurrence in postmenopausal females, recommending surgical excision of a cancerous breast through healthy tissue to make sure that not \\"a single root\\" is left behind, while discouraging ligatures and cautery to allow drainage of black bile. * 200. About this year Leonidas of Alexandria began advocating the excision of breast cancer via a wide cut through normal tissues like Galen, but recommended alternate incision and cautery, which became the standard for the next 15 centuries.

The hallmark for Viners Ltd. silver was registered to son Edward Viner: in 1932 it was \\"E.V\\" with figures and in 1964, it was \\"EV\\" with associated figures.\\"HALLMARKS OF ENGLISH SILVER/MAKER'S MARK IDENTIFICATION\\", Silver Collection website, accessed 23 March 2014 =Growth= One of the sons, Ruben Viner, became the driving force in the 20th century to expand the company. It manufactured stainless steel cutlery and other products. The firm prospered in the 1960s with a modern factory in Sheffield and subsidiaries in Ireland, France and Australia. From 1945, the cutlery industry in Sheffield began a slow decline, accelerated with the collapse of steel and other heavy industries. But, beginning in the mid-1970s, East Asian imports began to flood into the UK. The company started importing cutlery to finish and stamp \\"Made in Sheffield.\\" Loans for expansion were crippling the firm and they went bust in 1985. Ruben Viner had retired from the firm in 1980.

He played for the Indianapolis Hoosiers (), Louisville Colonels (-), Baltimore Orioles () and St. Louis Browns (). He was a player-manager for Louisville in 1888 and for St. Louis in 1890, and he umpired American Association games through 1891. Biography Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, Kerins began his major league career with the Indianapolis Hoosiers of the American Association. After the season, the Hoosiers folded, and John moved on to the Louisville Colonels, where he spent the next few seasons. Though Kerins played twice as many career major league games at first base as he did at catcher, he was often known more for his play at the latter position. In Louisville, he was the personal catcher for left-handed knuckleball pitcher Toad Ramsey. He led the league's catchers in 1886 with 157 assists despite catching only 65 games. Many of those assists came on one of Ramsey's 499 strikeouts that season when Kerins would mishandle a Ramsey knuckleball, which necessitated a throw to first base to complete the strikeout. Offensively, the 1887 season may have been his best; he hit .294 with a league-leading 19 triples and 49 stolen bases. Kerins finished the 1889 season with the Baltimore Orioles. Before the 1890 season, Kerins was working as a bartender in Indianapolis. He returned to the Orioles for the 1890 season but did not play in any regular season games before he was released in May of that year; he played for the St. Louis Browns for the rest of the season, concluding his playing career. In addition to playing, twice he was named interim manager, once with the Colonels in and also in his one season with the Browns.John Kerins Stats. Baseball-Reference.com. Accessed April 14, 2019. He also umpired a total of 246 major league games, mostly in the American Association from 1889 to 1891. His appointment as an AA umpire was made official in April 1891, after Kerins had retired as a player. By 1895, Kerins was working as a bartender at a Louisville bar partly owned by major league outfielder Tom Brown. In 1907, when another man of the same name was hired as an AA umpire, Kerins was still working as a bartender. Late in life, Kerins worked as a houseman at the Tyler Hotel in Louisville, Kentucky. He suffered from rheumatism and died after two weeks in a Louisville hospital in 1919. He was buried in a potter's field, but he was later reinterred at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

Located on Shakespeare Road near Lake Pupuke, it is administered by the Waitemata District Health Board, which provides health services to approximately 600,000 residents of the North Shore, Waitakere and Rodney districts of Auckland. Emergency Department staff at North Shore see more than 46,000 cases each year. Facilities The hospital provides up to 600 surgical and general medical treatment beds. It has twelve operating theatres (one specialised in obstetric care), an emergency department, a 50-bed Assessment and Diagnostic Unit, an intensive care centre, an Elective Surgery Centre and a coronary care, as well as a maternity and special care baby unit. The hospital also provides endoscopy, radiology, pathology, anaesthetic, gynecological, general surgery, a cardiac catheter lab and mental health services through the onsite Marinoto and He Puna Waiora units. Visiting specialists cover a number of further medical sub- disciplines. Two of the wards specialise in assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of older patients over 65 years of age.North Shore Hospital (database entry on healthpoint.co.nz website. Accessed 2008-06-21.) Funding and staffing In 2007, North Shore Hospital repeatedly reported 100% occupancy rates and difficulties in finding enough staff. This is alleged to be partly due to North Shore City's affluence, with the catchment area having some of the highest average incomes in New Zealand, as well as scoring high on other social indicators. As the District Health Board funding scheme distributes money based on these indicators, it has been claimed that it receives much less funding per population served than hospitals in other areas of the country. The issues with staff shortages and overcrowding, repeatedly discussed in the press during the middle of 2007, have led two North Shore National MPs to inquire into the issue, noting that a 'crisis of confidence' had developed, which was generating more concern from locals 'than anything else in recent times'.Hospital worries - The New Zealand Herald, Thursday 12 July 2007 In 2011 North Shore Hospital opened an Assessment and Diagnostic Unit (ADU) designed to improve overcrowding and patient flow through the North Shore Emergency Department, and increase inpatient bed capacity.

He was a significant diplomat and go-between in the affairs of his times, and was nicknamed the \\"cardinal with three hats\\", which he obtained successively from Urban VI, Clement VII, and Boniface IX. Padua Cathedral - tomb of the cardinal Pileo da Prata. Early Life Pileo was the son of Count Bianchino and Iselgarda da Carrara, the sister of Jacopino da Carrara. Hortis, pp. 22-24. He was born in the Castello di Prata in the diocese of Concordia or, perhaps, in Padua itself. He was patronized by the family of Francesco il Vecchio da Carrara, lord of Padua. He was a Canon of the cathedral of Padua in 1350 at the age of twenty,Dondi attributes the appointment to the patronage of the Carraresi: and held the dignity of Archpriest from 1356,Hortis, p. 23. though he was only in minor orders, when he was appointed bishop of Treviso by Pope Clement VI on 1 June 1358.* Eubel, p. 480. As bishop-elect, he initially had a Vicar General, Giorgio Torti of Pavia, and he is recorded as bishop as late as 28 June 1359. He did not enter Treviso, however, due to the hostility of the clergy and citizens, and the hostility of the Venetians against Francesco di Carrara, whose family were patrons of the bishop. =Bishop of Padua= Pileo was appointed bishop of Padua by Pope Innocent VI on 12 June 1359.Eubel, p. 386. As bishop, he summoned and presided over a diocesan synod on 8 March 1360.Dondi dall'Orologio VIII, pp. 106‚Äì107. At exactly the same time he was involved in his capacity as Grand Chancellor of the University of Padua, in mediating a dispute between the Law Faculty and the Arts Faculty, as to whether there should be one university or two. On 20 March 1360, he issued his decision, that there should be two institutions, but that the Rector of the Arts should swear to obey the statutes of the Law Faculty.There had originally been one university, which the law professors came to dominate to the extent that all members of the university where obliged to obey their statutes and their Rector. The professors of Medicine and of the arts set up their own organization with their own Rector, and were agitating to be considered a separate university independent of the Law faculty. Dondi dall'Orologio VIII, p. 107. In 1361, he modified the statutes of the cathedral Chapter, allowing younger Canons who were studying at the University to do so without penalty for their absence from their cathedra duties.Dondi dall'Orologio VIII, p. 108. Bishop Pileo also obtained from Pope Urban V a chair in theology for the University of Padua, only the third such chair to be established, after Paris and Bologna.Dondi dall'Orologio VIII, p. 109. Others put it that the University was entitled to issue doctoral degrees in theology. In 1394, he founded the Collegio Pratense in Padua, for the benefit of scholars studying at the University of Padua, and provided for the institution in his Testament of 1399.Dondi dall'Orologio VIII, p. 112. Malmignati says that the number of scholars was set at 20, and that they were to be drawn from Padua, Venice, and Treviso. =Archbishop of Ravenna= On 23 January 1370, he was named archbishop of Ravenna by Pope Urban V. When he was named a cardinal in 1378, he relinquished the episcopal throne, but continued on as Administrator of the diocese.Eubel, pp. 23, no. 2; 415. In 1372, Pope Gregory XI summoned Pileo to Avignon, and sent the archbishop along with the Bishop of Carpentras, Guillaume l'Estrange,Eubel, p. 168. as his nuncios to King Charles V of France. They were instructed to obtain a truce, and to bring representatives of France, England, and Navarre together to compose their differences. A conference took place in Bruxelles in 1374, with Archbishop Pileo and the Bishop of Carpentras serving as papal nuncios. Louis of Anjou and Philip of Burgundy took part. Pope Gregory wrote a letter to the King of France, threatening ecclesiastical censures against those who should reject the proposals of the nuncios. The most they could obtain was a truce in 1375, which was extended to 1377. The sticking point was Calais, which the English absolutely refused to surrender, and therefore the war continued. In 1376, Archbishop Pileo was drawn into the expansionist military adventures of Barnab√≤ Visconti of Milan, who threatened Tuscany as well as territories belonging to the papacy, including Bologna and the Patrimony of S. Peter. The archbishop was ordered by Pope Gregory to support his Cardinal Legate in Bologna and the Marchese d'Este with the sum of 500 gold florins charged against the archbishop's income as bishop. The raising of the required sums brought the archbishop a bad reputation as a despoiler of church property. At the same time, a Ghibelline rebellion in Ravenna cut the archbishop off from his source of income. In 1377, an opportunity arose which might have allowed Pope Gregory to repay Archbishop Pileo for his expenses in the papal diplomatic service, and to compensate him for his losses in Ravenna. The diocese of Tournai had become available, and Pileo was proposed for the post. But he was not eager to leave an archbishopric for a bishopric, unless he could hold Ravenna in commendam along with Tournai. The pope was willing to name him a patriarch along with Tournai, but at the moment no patriarchate was available, and the pope was set against holding two bishoprics at the same time. All he could promise Pileo, as he wrote on 4 January 1378 in his letter of refusal, was that the subject would be revisited at the next patriarchal vacancy. As it happened, Pope Gregory died on 27 March 1378. =Cardinal= Pileo di Prato was named a cardinal by Urban VI on 18 September 1378, and assigned the church of Santa Prassede as his titular church.Eubel, pp. 23, no. 2; 45. His first duty was to write a letter to the King of France, explaining the election of Urban, and arguing for its canonical validity. Writing from Venice on 15 December 1378, he also posted a lengthy letter to Count Louis of Flanders. Urban VI had sent him as a legate to Germany and Hungary, a journey made all the more critical since the Emperor Charles IV had died on 29 November 1378, and his successor Wenceslaus had sent representatives to Rome. Wenceslaus was promising obedience to Urban VI, and was seeking an imperial coronation. Pileo followed Wenceslaus to Mainz, Cologne, and Aix-la-Chapelle. The electors of Mainz and Cologne were important for the election of a Holy Roman Emperor. Pileo took the opportunity to lobby bishops on behalf of Urban VI's legitimacy, but Leopold of Austria and Wenceslaus of Brabant were pressing the new King of the Romans to summon a general council to deal with the growing schism, a move which would have called into question exactly what Pileo was promoting. He is said to have counselled Wenceslaus to resist the demands. In 1381, Pileo was sent along with several German nobles to arrange a marriage between King Wenceslaus' sister, Anne of Bohemia, and King Richard II of England, who were married in January 1382. He is accused of having used his legatine powers to the maximum while he was in England, lifting excommunications and cancelling vows of pilgrimage, receiving generous gifts for his services. He was greedy for money.Baluze, p. 1361. Dondi, pp. 71‚Äì74, quotes the evidence, but rejects some of it because the author did not accept Urban VI, and Walsingham because he must have been motivated by some private passion: \\"Forse questo quadro √® tropo caricato, forse l' autore era condotto scrivendolo da qualche privata passione, ma certo √® che egli prova la Legazione di Pilleo in Inghilterra ad evidenza, e che prova anche non sempre li Ministri costituire il Principe, ma che alcune volte questi si addattano o al volere, √≤ al sistema pratico del Sovrano e che 'Regis ad exemplum totus componisur Orbis'.\\" The Cardinal was back in Italy by 4 September 1382, where he visited Prata and manumitted all of his serfs, both there and elsewhere. =Naples= In October 1383, Pope Urban determined on a visit to the Kingdom of Naples. He took with him six cardinals, among them Pileo di Prata, and the papal court. The pope was extremely dissatisfied with the situation following the French invasion by Louis of Anjou, a supporter of the Avignon Pope Clement VII, and the passive defense offered by King Charles of Durazzo. He was equally dissatisfied with Charles' casual reception of his overlord into the Kingdom of Naples, but continued on to the city. The Neapolitans hated Urban, since many were still loyal to their original allegiance to Pope Clement VII in Avignon, whom Queen Joanna I had recognized as the true pope. They were hostile to Charles of Durazzo, who had murdered Queen Joanna and had frustrated Louis of Anjou's expedition. The pope's real purpose was to enhance his own family's fortune, in particular those of his nephew, Francesco Butillo, who had been cheated by Charles of Durazzo out of his share of the spoils of the destruction of the expedition of Louis of Anjou. A favorable opinion of the Neapolitans was solicited by the marriage of two of the pope's nieces to Neapolitan noblemen, but on Christmas Eve his nephew Francesco reversed it all by breaking into a convent and raping a noble Neapolitan nun. The pope quashed the legal proceedings against Francesco, and helped him to escape to his fief at Nocera. Theoderic was a witness to many of the events, but never an impartial one. He hated Urban VI and many of his own colleagues in the Roman Curia. In June 1384, Pope Urban was forced to leave Naples and seek refuge with his nephew at Nocera. In August, however, the cardinals who were at Nocera and many of the curiales fled to Naples.Theoderic, p. 69. On 17 December 1384, Pope Urban held a consistory at Nocera, and Cardinal Pileo was promoted from Cardinal Priest of S. Prassede to the post of suburbicarian Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati).His predecessor as Bishop of Tusculum, Cardinal Guillaume de Chanac, had died on 30 December 1383. Several prelates were offered a cardinal's hat, but declined: Archbishop Fridericus de Saarwerden of Cologne, Archbishop Adolfus de Naasau of Mainz, Archbishop Cuno de Falkenstein of Trier, Bishop Arnoldus de Horn of Liege, Bishop Wenceslaus de Silesia- Liegnitz of Bratislava, and Father Petrus de Rosenberg of Prague. Nine prelates accepted.Theoderic (who was present), pp. 80-82. Eubel, pp. 24-25, 39. Meanwhile, Cardinal Bartolomeo Mezzavacca, who was residing in Naples, set in motion an inquiry, led by the curialist Bartolomeo of Piacenza, to examine the question of deposing a pope if he were judged insane. He also consulted masters of theology and several Doctores in utroque iure, as well as King Charles and Queen Margarita.Theoderic, pp. 77-78. Urban VI heard of the consultations, and on 11 January 1385, he ordered the arrest of those cardinals within his reach: Joannes de Amelia, Gentilis de Sangro, Adam de Eston, Ludovicus Donati, Bartholomaeus de Cucurno, and Martinus de Judice. All except for Eston were killed at Genoa in December 1386 on orders of Urban VITheoderic I. 42, pp. 77-79. Eubel, pp. 23-24. Creighton, pp. 80-81. After the torture of the six cardinals began in the dungeons of the castle of Nocera, to which Theoderic of Nyem was a witness, five of the cardinals at liberty, led by Pileo di Prata, wrote an open letter to the clergy of Rome,Stephanus Baluzius [√âtienne Baluze], Vitae Paparum Avinionensium Volume 2 (Paris: apud Franciscum Muguet 1693) columns 983-988. detailing Urban's cruelties and furies, announcing that Urban VI was a heretic, and that they were withdrawing from his Obedience. Four of the five cardinals were deposed from their cardinalates,The four cardinals were: Luca Gentile, Poncello Orsini, Bartolommeo Mezzavacca, and Landolfo Maramaccio (Maramaldo). bringing the number of deposed cardinals to ten. The cardinals' letter was supported by the Abbot of Montecassino, who was also excommunicated.Creighton, p. 81. The date appears to have been 15 January 1385: Theoderic, p. 90, note 1. Pileo fled to Genoa, where he and Cardinal Galeazzo Tarlati da Petramala repudiated UrbanDondi assures his reader that Pileo repudiated Urban not because he thought the election of 1378 to be uncanonical, but because he was horrified at Urban's behavior. and sought refuge in Avignon.Theoderic, p. 111. Pileo was denounced by Urban VI as a \\"son of iniquity\\" in a bull of 25 August 1385, written at Lucca; and on 5 October 1385 he deprived Pileo of his cardinalate, his bishopric of Tusculum, and the archbishopric of Ravenna. =Avignon= On 13 June 1387 Pileo joined the Obedience of the Avignon Pope Clement VII, who named him Cardinal Priest of Santa Prisca; he lost his precedence as a cardinal bishop.Eubel, pp. 23, no. 2; 46. Having become exasperated at the negotiations of the Florentines, to whom he had suggested a general council to resolve the schism, Pope Clement VII assembled an army, mostly of Gascons and Bretons, and, on 4 May 1388, appointed Cardinal Pileo as his legate for Tuscany and Lombardy. Pileo again made overtures to the Florentines, but Urban's cardinal, Angelo Acciaolo, persuaded the Florentines to reject them. Florence was reduced, in part thanks to citizens favorable to Avignon, and after a successful storming of the city by the Gascons and Bretons. Pileo and the army, joined by the forces of Rinaldo Orsini, then moved against Orvieto, which they seized and in which they installed a friendly government. They then took Terni, Narni, Montefiascone, and Spoleto. After Urban VI's death on 15 October 1389,Eubel, p. 22. the new pope of the Roman Obedience, Boniface IX (Pietro Tomacelli of Naples), restored three of Urban's deposed cardinals to their positions: Adam Eston, Bartolomeo Mezzavacca, and Landolfo Maramaldo.This happened either on 18 December 1389, or in February 1390. Eubel, p. 25. Cardinal Pileo was reinstated in the Roman Obedience by Pope Boniface IX in his previous post as Bishop of Tusculum, but not until 13 February 1391.Eubel, p. 26. He did not recover the Archbishopric of Ravenna, since Urban VI had assigned it to Cardinal Cosimo Migliorati. Clement VII labelled him infamem transfugam, impostorem, ac fidei venalis hominem (a disreputable turncoat, an imposter, and a man with his loyalty for sale). In 1392, Pope Boniface appointed Cardinal Pileo his Legate in Umbria, the Romagna, and the Marches, with a salary of 3,000 zecchini. He helped the pope by loosening the grip of the Malatesta family on Todi, and he calmed the strife between Guelfs and Ghibellines in Perugia, at least for a short time. In 1394, Cardinal Pileo obtained permission to return home, and he departed Rome on 4 May. After a visit to Prata, and a reception in Venice, by October he returned to Padua. He informed Francesco II of his intention to found a college for students at the University of Padua, and the Lord of Padua obliged him by giving him a house in the Contrada of S. Margherita. Thus began the Collegio Pratense. He is next heard of in 1397, when he was back in Rome by 5 September. He may have become Dean of the College of Cardinals in 1397, as the most senior Cardinal Bishop after the death of Philippe of Alen√ßon. On Christmas Eve 1398, the Pope was ill, and Cardinal Pileo di Prata presided at the Vespers service in the larger chapel. He also sang the third Mass of Christmas Day. In 1398, he was assigned to a commission of three cardinals to judge the crimes of Count Onorato Caetani of Fondi, who had been the protector of the adherents of Clement VII (Robert of Geneva) since April 1378. Count Onorato was found guilty on 2 May 1399, and had ecclesiastical censures imposed on him. The Cardinal drew up his last will and testament in Rome, on 4 October 1399. Cardinal Pileo died in Rome in December 1399 or early in 1400. The Chapter of the cathedral of Padua appointed a procurator to deal with the Testament of the cardinal on 24 June 1400, noting that the late cardinal was buried in the chapel of S. John the Evangelist. Notes Sources *Cardella, Lorenzo (1793). Memorie storiche de' cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa. Vol. II.

The 24 Hours of Canaan (July 13‚Äì14, 1992) was one of the first sanctioned 24 hour mountain bike events. At the 24 Hours of Indiglo (later renamed 24 Hours of Adrenalin) 17-year-old Ed Hunt became the first solo competitor at a 24-hour mountain bike event. These races attract a wide variety of riders from elite professional racers, experienced non-professional racers to amateurs. Because the races are typically held in the countryside, racers usually camp on the site. Sometimes racers may arrive several days ahead of time, to claim a good camping spot, preview the course or acclimatise to altitude. As a result, many of them also have a festival component to them including side events, catering and trade stands. 24 hour racing was originally conceived as a team sport, with two or more riders in male, female or mixed teams, taking turns to complete laps of the course. During the night, racers use lighting systems to negotiate the course. 24 Hours of Adrenalin held their last world solo 24 hour championships in 2010 and there was no world solo 24 hour championships in 2011. A new organisation WEMBO was founded to continue solo 24 hour mountain biking at world level and WEMBO have held both continental and world solo 24 hour mountain bike championships since 2012. WEMBO World championships have been held in Italy(2) Australia, Scotland(2) USA, New Zealand and Brasil with Australia to host again in 2021 and Italy in 2022.

The air medical division provides emergency medical services to between 70,000 and 100,000 patients every year. It operates in 48 states and Haiti, with air medical as its primary business focus. Its corporate headquarters are located in the Denver Technological Center, Greenwood Village, Colorado, in the Denver metropolitan area. The company was founded by Roy Morgan and began air medical operations in 1980. From 1991 to 2017, the company was a publicly traded company under the NASDAQ ticker \\"AIRM\\". In 2017, it was acquired by a private equity firm. In 2012, the company acquired its first helicopter tour operations, Sundance Helicopters, in Las Vegas, Nevada. A year later, Blue Hawaiian joined its tourism division. The company has more than 5,000 employees and operates a fleet of approximately 450 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. History In 1980, Roy Morgan founded Air Methods after a personal experience convinced him that properly equipped and staffed air medical service helicopters were a necessity. Air Methods purchased CJ Systems Aviation Group, a leading provider of aeromedical transport, in October 2007. In 2011, Air Methods acquired Omniflight Helicopters, Inc., operating it as a wholly owned subsidiary. Omniflight Helicopters consisted of over 100 helicopters. In July 2011, Air Methods (Air Methods International, Ltd.) entered into a joint venture agreement with Basari Holding, AS and Anka Aerospace & Defense, LLC to form Helistar, AS. The joint venture company is headquartered in Ankara, Turkey. In October 2012, Air Methods opened its state-of-the-art technologically advanced training center in Aurora, Colorado. Located near the corporate office, the 14,000-square-foot facility has a simulation areas, learning classrooms and office space. Also in 2012, the company diversified into helicopter tourism. In 2016, Air Methods acquired Tri-State Care Flight. In 2017, Air Methods was purchased by American Securities LLC. In 2020 Air Methods received federal emergency relief funds as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. A requirement of this funding is that companies are not allowed to charge people surprise bills for COVID-19 related services. Despite this, Air Methods has continued to issue such bills, which people are not required to pay.  Service models  Air Methods provides services through three basic programs: Community-Based Service model (CBS), Hospital-Based Service model (HBS) and Alternative-Delivery Model (ADM). Under all three programs, Air Methods transports persons requiring intensive medical care from either the scene of an accident or general care hospitals, to trauma centers or tertiary care centers. As of 2009, the CBS operated 105 bases at hospitals, fire stations or airports, operating more than 127 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Air Methods employees provide medical care to patients en route. As of 2009, the HBS delivery model was serving 80 hospital customers in 33 states and operated a fleet of more than 170 hospital-based aircraft and medical care en route is provided by employees or contractors of customer hospitals.

Following a 2006 accident Craig Yale, vice president of corporate development, stated in a news conference shortly after the accident, \\"We fly over 100,000 hours a year, 85,000 missions a year, and in doing so have had very few fatal accidents over a 10-year period.\\" *In January 2005, an Air Methods helicopter crashed in Washington, D.C., resulting in two dead and one injured, and another crashed in Mississippi, killing one. *On December 10, 2006, three were killed in the 2006 Mercy Air helicopter accident in Cajon Pass, California. *On May 10, 2008, helicopter N135UW, known as Med Flight 1, crashed near La Crosse, Wisconsin, fatally injuring all three crew members. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter \\"may have flown into a hill and or struck some trees.\\" Impact debris and rotor blade fragments were found near the top of the 1,160 feet elevation ridgeline about 4.5 miles south of La Crosse Airport. Main debris was located 600 feet below that point around 930 feet elevation. La Crosse Municipal Airport field elevation is 654 feet. On September 3 of 2010 the NTSB released its report, finding that the probable cause of the accident was \\"The pilot‚Äôs failure to maintain clearance from trees along the top of a ridgeline due to inadequate preflight planning, insufficient altitude, and the lack of a helicopter terrain awareness and warning system.\\" *On June 29, 2008, a Bell 407 medical helicopter operated by Air Methods collided with another medical helicopter in Arizona, killing all seven who were aboard both aircraft. Another Air Methods helicopter crashed in May in Wisconsin soon after taking off. Three people were killed in that accident: the pilot, flight doctor and flight nurse. *On July 28, 2010, LifeNet 12, a Eurocopter AS350B3 crashed in Tucson, Arizona, killing all three crewmembers aboard. LifeNet 12 based out of Douglas Arizona was en route back to Douglas from Marana, Arizona. Witnesses described the helicopter losing power in flight, crashing into the street below. It appeared from witnesses that the pilot was able to steer the aircraft away from landing into a house nearby. *On August 26, 2011 four people (three crew members and one patient) were killed when a LifeNet Eurocopter AS350 based at Rosecrans Airport and connected to Heartland Hospital in St. Joseph, Missouri crashed near Liberty, Missouri. Initial crash reports indicated it had run out of fuel. The helicopter had traveled 45 miles from St. Joseph to Harrison County Community Hospital in Bethany, Missouri to pick up a patient. It did not refuel before traveling another 70 miles en route to its intended destination at Liberty Hospital. It was reported to be within a mile of landing for fuel at Midwest National Air Center in Mosby, Missouri (near Liberty) when it crashed. In 2013 the NTSB received information indicating that texting may have been a contributing cause, making it the first time texting had been found to occur during a fatal air accident. *On July 3, 2015, a Eurocopter AS350B3 medical helicopter operated by Air Methods crashed into a parking lot in Frisco, Colorado. The pilot was fatally injured, and the two flight nurses on board were seriously injured. The helicopter was destroyed by post-crash fire. *On April 26, 2018, an Air Methods Corp Airbus Helicopters AS350B2 (N127LN), apparently operating on behalf of Ascension Wisconsin Spirit Medical Transport, was destroyed when it crashed near Hazelhurst, Wisconsin towards the end of a flight from Madison to Woodruff, Wisconsin.

The FMO protein trimer. The BChl a molecules are depicted in green, the central magnesium atom in red and the protein in grey (\\"cartoons\\" representation). Each monomer contains bacteriochlorophylls. The Fenna- Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex is a water-soluble complex and was the first pigment-protein complex (PPC) to be structure analyzed by x-ray spectroscopy. It appears in green sulfur bacteria and mediates the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the membrane-embedded bacterial reaction center (bRC). Its structure is trimeric (C3-symmetry). Each of the three monomers contains eight bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) molecules. They are bound to the protein scaffold via chelation of their central magnesium atom either to amino acids of the protein (mostly histidine) or water-bridged oxygen atoms (only one BChl a of each monomer). Since the structure is available, calculating structure-based optical spectra is possible for comparison with experimental optical spectra. In the simplest case only the excitonic coupling of the BChls is taken into account. More realistic theories consider pigment-protein coupling. An important property is the local transition energy (site energy) of the BChls, different for each, due to their individual local protein environment. The site energies of the BChls determine the direction of the energy flow. Some structural information on the FMO-RC super complex is available, which was obtained by electron microscopy and linear dichroism spectra measured on FMO trimers and FMO-RC complexes. From these measurements, two orientations of the FMO complex relative to the RC are possible. The orientation with BChl 3 and 4 close to the RC and BChl 1 and 6 (following Fenna and Matthews' original numbering) oriented towards the chlorosomes is useful for efficient energy transfer. Test object The complex is the simplest PPC appearing in nature and therefore a suitable test object for the development of methods that can be transferred to more complex systems like photosystem I. Engel and co-workers observed that the FMO complex exhibits remarkably long quantum coherence, but after about a decade of debate, Wilkins and Dattani showed that this quantum coherence has no significance to the functioning of the complex. Furthermore, it was shown that the reported long lived oscillations observed in the spectra are solely due to groundstate vibrational dynamics and do not reflect any energy transfer dynamics. Quantum light harvesting Light harvesting in photosynthesis employs both classical and quantum mechanical processes with an energy efficiency of almost 100 percent. For light to produce energy in classical processes, photons must reach reaction sites before their energy dissipates in less than one nanosecond. In photosynthetic processes, this is not possible. Because energy can exist in a superposition of states, it can travel all routes within a material at the same time. When a photon finds the correct destination, the superposition collapses, making the energy available. However, no purely quantum process can be wholly responsible, because some quantum processes slow down the movement of quantized objects through networks. Anderson localization prevents the spread of quantum states in random media. Because the state acts like a wave, it is vulnerable to disruptive interference effects. Another issue is the quantum zeno effect, in which an unstable state never changes if it is continuously measured/watched, because watching constantly nudges the state, preventing it from collapsing. Interactions between quantum states and the environment act like measurements. The classical interaction with the environment changes the wave-like nature of the quantum state just enough to prevent Anderson localisation, while the quantum zeno effect extends the quantum state's lifetime, allowing it to reach the reaction centre. The proposed long lifetime of quantum coherence in the FMO influenced many scientists to investigate quantum coherence in the system, with Engel's 2007 paper being cited over 1500 times within 5 years of its publication. The proposal of Engel is still debated in literature with the suggestion that the original experiments were interpreted incorrectly assigning the spectral oscillations to electronic coherences instead of ground-state vibrational coherences, which will naturally be expected to live longer due to the narrower spectral width of vibrational transitions. =Computing= The problem of finding a reaction centre in a protein matrix is formally equivalent to many problems in computing. Mapping computing problems onto reaction center searches may allow light harvesting to work as a computational device, improving computational speeds at room temperature, yielding 100-1000x efficiency.

He was the grandfather of Duke Peter of Oldenburg as well as grandfather of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, General of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. His great-great grandson, Nicholas Romanov, was the President of the Romanov Family Association until his death in 2014. Peter of Oldenburg was a scholar and philanthropist. He was also noted composer of music. In 1857 he composed the music for Marius Petipa's ballet La Rose, la Violette et le Papillon. The Pas d'Esclave from the ballet Le Corsaire, which is taken from his score for this work, is still heard in theatres all over the world.  Early life  Duke Peter was born on 26 August 1812 in Yaroslavl, Russia. His father, Duke George, who was only the second son of the reigning Duke of Oldenburg, had no prospects of inherited his father's state or fortune of his own and was living in Russia since his marriage in 1809 to Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia. Duke George, who had been appointed governor on the Volga, died six month after Peter, his second, was born. Peter's mother Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia was the favorite sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia who took his two nephews, Peter and his older brother Alexander, under his protection. The brothers lived in Russia until his mother married King William I of W√ºrttemberg in 1816.Mcintosh, p. 372. They moved to W√ºrttemberg and were educated in Stuttgart. At the death of his mother, less than three years later, Peter and his brother were sent to their grandfather in Oldenburg. Being in direct line of succession to the throne of Oldenburg, as their uncle the hereditary Grand Duke Augustus was unmarried at the time, both boys were given the same extensive education by their grandfather Duke Peter as he had given his own sons and were regularly sent on instructive trips around Germany to broaden their education. In May 1829 his grandfather died and after the death of his brother Alexander in November of the same year, Peter's maternal uncle, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia sent for Peter, and named him a colonel in the Lifeguards. He quickly rose through the ranks and was subsequently appointed lieutenant general. After four years service he retired, and became active in St. Petersburg government. In 1834 he was made a Russian senator, and it was from that time that his name began to be known as a great philanthropist, devoting his energies primarily to education. He founded the Imperial School of Jurisprudence, at which Russia's future judges and administrators were educated, and in 1844 he was appointed head of an organization to further the education of women. Peter of Oldenburg was also a scholar, speaking eight languages. As honorary president of the Tsarina Maria Trust, he also played a leading role in overseeing the development of hospitals in Russia, one of which in St Petersburg was called the Prince Peter of Oldenburg Children Hospital. He also made substantial donation to school building programs in Oldenburg, his country of origin.  Marriage  On 23 April 1837 Duke Peter married Therese Wilhelmine Friederikke, Princess of Nassau-Weilburg in Biebrich. This was a happy marriage that lasted for more than thirty years. They had eight children, three of them died early. A daughter Cecilie died in childhood in 1843 and another daughter, Catherine and a son George died from tuberculosis in 1866 and 1871 respectively.McIntosh, p. 373. Duke Peter and his wife led an exemplary family life, and looked carefully after the education of their children. The family spent the winter months in Peterhof and moved for the summer to their other residence Kamenoi- Ostroff.  Composer  Duke Peter was a talented pianist and composer, and in 1842 he composed his first major piano concerto. In 1844 his second piano concerto was performed for the first time at the Mikhailovsky Palace by the great pianist Clara Schumann, and conducted by his longtime friend and colleague Adolf Henselt. As with most Russian nobility, Duke Peter was a longtime balletomane and patron of the arts. In 1857 he was commissioned to compose the score for Marius Petipa's ballet-divertissement La Rose, la Violette et le Papillon, which was given as a performance for the royal court at the Imperial Theatre of Tsarskoe Selo. In 1858 Petipa extracted a Pas de Deux from the Duke's score and added it to his revival of the ballet Le Corsaire, renaming the piece the Pas d'Esclave. It is the only composition of Duke Peter's still heard today in the theater. Many of Duke Peter's compositions were used as educational tools by the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. The composer and teacher Adolf Henselt, a close friend of the Duke's, expanded on many of his compositions in order to utilize them for instructional purposes.  Last years  Peter spent fifty years in Russia's service, for which he was widely respected and was thanked by a massive celebration in St Petersburg in 1880 attended by his first cousin Tsar Alexander II of Russia and most of the Imperial family, his cousin Grand Duke Nicholas of Oldenburg and representatives of the many organizations with which the Duke was connected. He was close to Tsar Alexander II and took his assassination in March 1881 very badly and died two months later on 14 May 1881 in St. Petersburg.

He was ordained as the guru by the elders of the community after Swami ShankarƒÅshram I died without selecting a shishya (disciple). Normally it is the shishya who ordained by the guru, who succeeds as the guru of the community. Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram II was an ascetic by nature and did not like to wield power. He lived most of his life practising yoga at Kollur and only occasionally visited the ChitrƒÅpur Matha, the head matha of the community. He left his shishya, Shankarashram discharge most of the administrative duties.  Period of turmoil  The period between the death of Swami ShankarƒÅshram and the ordainment of Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram II was a period of turmoil for the SƒÅraswat Community. = The demolition and retribution = When Swami ShankarƒÅshram died suddenly without accepting a disciple or shishya, the community was left without a head. The situation was similar to that faced before the Guru Parampara was initiated. The King of Nagar seized the assets of the matha .The community was again issued a decree that unless they showed the King their MathƒÅdhipati(Head Guru of the matha), they would have to face heavy penalties. The King ordered his men to demolish the samƒÅdhi(shrine) of Swami ShankararƒÅshram(See SamƒÅdhi of Swami ShankarƒÅshram). The shrine had a Shiva Linga made of clay, which the King's men came to destroy. No matter how many torrents of water were poured on it or how many blows of the sledge- hammer fell upon it, the Shiva-linga did not suffer a single dent. The Guru's grace prevented such destruction.Eventually the men gave up trying to destroy the shrine and went back. Within a matter of a few days, all the men who tried destroying the shrine ended up dying. ‚ÄúSome of them threw up blood, Some died a violent death, Violence when men give Violence is what they get The Sadguru is gentle and loving, But, when man willfully does attack, The answer is swift retribution, Pat!

He was a hermit who used to practise Yoga at Kollur. The devotees went and met this noble person and pleaded with him to be the guru of the SƒÅraswats. The sanyasi agreed to their pleas. Thus on the banks of the TƒÅribagil River, the devotees ordained him as Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram(Known as Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram II since the first guru of the community was Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram) Once the news of the arrival of the new guru reached the ears of the King of Nagar, he took back the order and restored the ChitrƒÅpur Matha back to the community. Thus the SƒÅraswats had got back their head matha and also had a guru to lead them.  Shishya Sweekar  Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram II was reclusive by nature. So, once the period of turmoil for the community was over, he decided to accept a shishya(disciple) and then continue his life of an ascetic. He ordained a shishya from the Shukla Bhat family in MallƒÅpur village in Karnataka. He was ordained as ShankarƒÅshram(). He is formally known as Swami ShankarƒÅshram II as the second mathƒÅdhipati(Chief of the matha at Chitrapur) was Swami ShankarƒÅshram. After accepting a disciple, Swamiji continued with his ascetic life. He was mostly at Kollur and would visit the Chitrapur Matha frequently to check on his shishya as well as the administration.  Ailing woman of Kumta  Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram II is known to have performed miracles for his devotees in their times of need.The best known is that of the ailing woman from the village of Kumta.She was the wife of a businessman. He tried the best of medications but she would not get better and would always end up worse. This businessman was asked by his friend to seek the blessings of Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram at Shirali. The businessman from Kumta prayed with sincerity to Lord BhavƒÅnishankara(Presiding deity of the community) and with full devotion fell at the feet of swamiji. Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram offered him PhalmantrƒÅksat ‚Äì Phal.man.trƒÅ.kshat(rice smeared with vermilion or kumkum) as prasad(\\"holy offering\\") The businessman offered this to his wife and upon placing it on her head, suddenly she recovered. She said that she had a dream of a sanyasi who assured her that everything will be all right and that she will be fine soon. When the couple went to seek blessings from Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram the woman was astonished to see that the sanyƒÅsi who came to her in her dreams was none other than poojya swamiji himself. They prostrated in joy at His feet and sought his blessings.  Mending of relations with Bhatkals  Under Swami ShankarƒÅshram I the community had fallen out with the people from Bhatkal(See Fall-out with the Bhatkals). So Swami ParijnƒÅnƒÅshram mended the strained relations with that clan. This happened as a result of a Domino effect which was started by a wealthy businessman from Bhatkal. Initially he had no faith in the Guru Parampara. A friend of his persuaded him to go along with him to meet swamiji at Shirali. With a lot of persuasion, he agreed to go along. But the mere presence and touch of swamiji is said to have brought about a total transformation in him. He fell at Swamiji's feet and begged for apology on his behalf and also on those in his clan who were non-believers. This SƒÅraswat businessman spread the word about the divine grace of the Guru Parampara and thus the stand-off of sorts with the clan of Bhatkals was resolved. Thus under Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram II Swamiji there was a \\"Spiritual Tide\\" that swept across the community and uniting it under one roof of the Chitrapur Math.  Death  Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram II Swamiji died on the Ekadashi day(11th day of the month according to the lunar calendar) in the month of BhƒÅdrapad in 1770 at Shirali. His last word to his shishya, ShankarƒÅshram were:(as roughly translated from Konkani to English) \\"You have to now lead the community. Counsel them like how a mother would guide her child. Guide the people in this spiritual journey to lead a spiritual and chaste life. Remember, the soul is eternal and imperishable even though functions of the body do cease....\\" The shrine(samƒÅdhi) of Swami Parij√±ƒÅnƒÅshram II Swamiji is found at the Chitrapur Math at Shirali, to the left of the samƒÅdhi of his guru, Swami ShankarƒÅshram I.

Miller or Clenand Miller or McClelland Miller) was an outlaw with the James- Younger Gang who was killed during the gang's robbery at Northfield, Minnesota. Miller was born on either January 9, 1850 (the date on his tombstone) or December 15, 1849 in Kearney, Missouri. His younger brother Edward T. Miller also joined the gang and was allegedly killed by Jesse James in 1881. Guerilla career At the age of 14, Clell Miller joined Bloody Bill Anderson's guerrillas during the American Civil War. He was captured during the skirmish in which Anderson was killed on October 26, 1864. This was Miller's first and only wartime combat, and he was lucky not to have been executed by his captors. However, because of his youth, he was sent to St. Louis, Missouri at the Gratiot Street Prison. His father obtained his release in April 1865, perjuring himself by saying the family had always been Union supporters. Miller was described as being 5 feet 8 inches tall, with dark reddish auburn hair. Outlaw career From top to bottom: Bodies of Clell Miller and Bill Caldwell [aka Stiles]; Cole Younger; Charlie Pitts (two rows); Bob Younger; the Northfield Bank The following James gang events were allegedly attributed to Miller: *June 3, 1871 - Ocobock Brothers' Bank at Corydon, Iowa. The Pinkerton Detective Agency was hired to pursue the gang and Miller was captured in July by a detective Westphal. He posted bail and was later acquitted after a long list of witnesses testified he was elsewhere at the time of the robbery. He was represented by attorney John McClanahan of Corydon, Iowa. A deposition from the trial is owned by the McClanahan family. Clell denied being in the James gang, but said later that he 'might as well join them because his reputation had been ruined by the trial'. *April 29, 1872 - Bank of Columbia at Columbia, Kentucky.

Death On September 7, 1876, Miller was shot and killed by townspeople in the robbery attempt on the First National Bank of Northfield, along with outlaw Bill Chadwell and bank cashier Joseph Lee Heywood and citizen Nicholas Gustavson. Wounded in the fight were Frank James, Charlie Pitts (later killed), Cole Younger, Jim Younger, Bob Younger and Northfield citizen Alonzo E. Bunker. Miller's body was photographed and then buried in Northfield. However, his father claimed the body and Miller was buried at Muddy Fork Cemetery in Kearney.

He began his professional career in 1994 and first reached the top division in 2002. His highest rank was maegashira 10. He retired in May 2009 to take over the Azumazeki stable. Career Ushiomaru made his debut in March 1994, joining Azumazeki stable. He began using the fighting name of Takamisano, switching briefly to Tenfuku before adopting his familiar name in November 1995. In his early career in the lower ranks, he served as a tsukebito, or personal attendant, to yokozuna Akebono. After a long stint in the third makushita division, he reached sekitori status by winning promotion to the second j≈´ry≈ç division in January 2002. After winning the j≈´ry≈ç division title in July of that year with a 13-2 record, he was promoted to the top makuuchi division for the next tournament. He was injured during his second top division tournament and had to withdraw, resulting in demotion back to the second division. He struggled in 2005, losing sekitori status on two occasions, but then made something of a comeback, returning to the top division for four straight tournaments from November 2006 to May 2007. He was one of the few high ranking sumo wrestlers from Shizuoka Prefecture, which has not supplied nearly as many new entrants as the colder northern parts of Japan such as Aomori and Hokkaid≈ç. When he reached the top division in 2002 he was the first wrestler from Shizuoka Prefecture to do so since Katsunishiki, who spent just one tournament in makuuchi in January 1976. (He has since been followed by Katayama and Sagatsukasa.) Retirement from sumo In 2007, the head coach and founder of Azumazeki stable, former sekiwake Takamiyama, indicated that Ushiomaru would succeed him when he reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty-five in June 2009. This came as a surprise to some, who had assumed that his more high profile and higher ranked stablemate Takamisakari would take over. After completing his last match in the May, 2009 tournament, Ushiomaru did announce his retirement from active sumo to take over head coach duties from the retiring Kuhaulua. He assumed the name Onogawa until 16 June when Kuhaulua officially retired and he became Azumazeki Oyakata. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan on 31 January 2010. Takamisakari remained an active wrestler until January 2013, when he announced his retirement. He then assisted Ushiomaru in running Azumazeki stable under the elder name of Furiwake. In February 2018 Azumazeki moved his stable to new premises in Shibamata District, Katsushika. Death On December 13, 2019, he died of angiosarcoma in the Azumazeki stable in Shibamata, Tokyo, aged 41. A tsuya (wake) was held at Azumazeki stable on December 18 with Akebono, for whom Ushiomaru was a tsukebito, in attendance despite ill health. The funeral was held on December 19, with the former Azumazeki Oyakata (ex-Takamiyama) attending and the chair of the Sumo Association Hakkaku giving the memorial address. Takamisakari was confirmed as Ushiomaru's successor to the Azumazeki stable in January 2020. Family Ushiomaru was married, and the couple's child, a daughter, was born in January 2018. Fighting style Ushiomaru preferred oshi-sumo or pushing and thrusting techniques to fighting on the mawashi. His most common winning kimarite were oshi-dashi or push out, and yori-kiri or force out, which together accounted for nearly half his career victories.

Based in Denver, Colorado, the band has been active off and on since 1982, taking on a number of musicians over the years. They have made seven studio albums between 1984 and 2017, and released one live album recorded at NEARfest in 2000. Their music is a mix of rock, folk, jazz and 20th-century classical music. Music.com remarked that \\"...Thinking Plague stand out as a shining example of avant-garde music blended with just enough rock for it to be called progressive rock...\\" While never directly related to Rock in Opposition (RIO), Thinking Plague was strongly influenced by this late-1970s movement, particularly Henry Cow and Art Bears. In spite of Johnson's dislike of the term, the band has often been categorized as a \\"RIO\\" band.. History =Early Plague= Mike Johnson and Bob Drake first met in 1978 and played in several cover bands. They began experimenting with basement recordings in 1980 and by 1982 they had enough song material to attempt a few live performances. For these shows they enlisted the services of classically trained vocalist Sharon Bradford, luthier Harry Fleishman on keyboards, and Rick Arsenault on drums. This ensemble became the first incarnation of Thinking Plague. They played at a few venues around Denver in 1983 but their complicated music was not well received and Johnson and Drake decided to make an album of their material instead. With Bradford, Fleishman and Mark Fuller on drums the band worked on and off for almost a year recording their songs at a crude 8-track recording facility in the basement of an old slaughterhouse called the Packing House Studios. Having limited funds they did all the tracking and mixing themselves, and released the album, ...A Thinking Plague in 1984 on their own Endemic label. Only 500 LPs were pressed with each cover hand painted by Drake with spray-paint and a stencil. In spite of the small scale, low-tech quality of the release, a number of distributors, including Recommended Records and Wayside Music (Cuneiform Records) agreed to sell the album and it was well received by some critics. In 1985 Johnson and Drake began to record material for a new Thinking Plague album. The Packing House Studios had closed but they had access to a few \\"low budget\\" recording facilities in Denver. Having disbanded the \\"Packing House\\" group after their first album, Johnson and Drake recruited a new band: singer-songwriter Susanne Lewis, drummer Mark Fuller and keyboardist Eric Moon. Disregarding, or ignorant of the proper \\"industry\\" way of doing things, Thinking Plague recorded their second album, Moonsongs. The title track was a fifteen-and-a-half minute \\"tribal-pagan-environmental-anti- materialistic avant-rock ritual\\" composed by Johnson.. Initially Moonsongs was released in 1986 on cassette by Endemic, but the following year the band signed with Dead Man's Curve Records in London and Moonsongs was released on LP. As with their first album, Moonsongs was praised in \\"progressive\\" circles and Thinking Plague enhanced their stature as an avant-rock band. Riding on the success of their two albums, Thinking Plague performed a series of live shows in 1987 in Denver, opening for Sonic Youth at one of them. Pianist/clarinetist Lawrence Haugseth joined the band for the live performances, but left in early 1988. Haugseth's brief stay did, however, establish the need for a woodwind/reed section in the band. Fuller and Moon had also left the band in late 1987, which prompted the acquisition of three new musicians: classical pianist, Shane Hotle, bassist Maria Moran, and Mark Harris on clarinet, saxophones and flutes. Drake switched from bass guitar to drums. =In This Life= Recording for a new album began in early 1988 in various studios, including a large rehearsal room in an old yogurt factory (referred to as the Yog Factory). Johnson and Lewis had collaborated on a collection of songs for the album, which featured several \\"new\\" instruments, including sampler, tabla, various African and Balinese percussion instruments, and a fiddle (courtesy Bob Drake). Ex-Henry Cow guitarist Fred Frith guested on one track, \\"Organism (version II)\\", the original version (also with Frith) having been released on Recommended Records' RƒìR Records Quarterly Vol.2 No.4. Drake did all the production work and the album, In This Life was finished in mid-1988. At the time ex-Henry Cow drummer and Recommended Records founder, Chris Cutler was on tour with Pere Ubu in Denver and Johnson gave Cutler a cassette tape of the new album. Cutler offered to release it on the Recommended label, and in September 1989, In This Life became the first US- made CD on the British label. In This Life was widely distributed and began \\"gaining kudos from aficionados of avant rock from all around the world.\\" But Thinking Plague's euphoria was short lived when Lewis moved to New York City. Attempts to replace her with a local singer were unsuccessful and working \\"long distance\\" with her proved impractical at the time. Disillusioned, Drake relocated to Los Angeles to work as an engineer and producer, and Moran left the band, leaving Thinking Plague at the point of disintegrating. In Los Angeles, Drake met drummer Dave Kerman of an avant-rock band, the 5uu's and began working with Kerman's band. Kerman's interest in Thinking Plague led to him joining the Denver band. Drake and Lewis also agreed to \\"rejoin\\" (despite the distances) and with the other remaining members, Johnson, Harris and Hotle, Thinking Plague \\"reformed\\" in 1990. For the next few years the band worked intermittently at some long-distance rehearsals, performed in a few concerts and made some new recordings, after which all work was put on hold. During this period of dormancy Johnson toured across Europe in 1995 with Drake, Kerman and the 5uu's, but upon returning to the United States the three agreed that reviving Thinking Plague again was not a practical option. =Rebirth= Thinking Plague playing at the 19th Olympia Experimental Music Festival, June 2013. Johnson joined another local avant-rock band, Hamster Theatre in 1996, and suggested to its leader, accordionist and bassist Dave Willey that he join a new incarnation of Thinking Plague. Willey agreed and recommended Deborah Perry as a singer. At much the same time, Kerman moved to Denver and rejoined the band. With existing members Harris and Hotle the new Thinking Plague began recording new material that Johnson had written. In early 1998 the finished tracks were sent to Drake (now living in France) for mixing and production, and the result was Thinking Plague's fourth album, In Extremis, released in 1998 by Cuneiform Records. In Extremis was rated the top album in 1998 by Gnosis, and its success resulted in new concert appearances for the band. A new member, Matt Mitchell on keyboards was recruited to replace Hotle who had left after the making of In Extremis, and Thinking Plague performed at the 1999 ProgDay Festival, followed by a tour of the eastern and mid-western United States. In June 2000 the band played at NEARfest, a recording of which was mixed three years later by Drake and released as Upon Both Your Houses in 2004 by NEARfest Records. In July 2000 the band toured France and Italy. After the concerts in Europe, Kerman left the band and was replaced by ex-Sleepytime Gorilla Museum drummer David Shamrock. Work began on a new album, A History of Madness, which was released in September 2003 by Cuneiform Records. It was recorded over a period of two years, with half the band members flying into Denver from across the United States to add their contributions. A History of Madness was the first Thinking Plague album that Bob Drake did not produce; Johnson and Mark McCoin, of the Brave New Audio studio where the album was recorded, did all the mixing. Name Thinking Plague's name was created by the band's founders, Mike Johnson and Bob Drake. According to Johnson, \\"The idea was to say something about that sort of existential condition of being unable to stop thinking, analyzing, or otherwise intellectualizing, which causes one to be separated from 'things in themselves', as it were.\\" Members A number of musicians have passed through Thinking Plague over the years, except for Mike Johnson who has remained with the group since its inception.

The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is the key university of science and technology in Norway. The Department of Petroleum Engineering and Applied Geophysics (IPT) was established in 1973, shortly after the start of production (Ekofisk field) from the Norwegian continental shelf. The department came to include Petroleum Engineering as well as Geophysics, which is seen as a major strength of the petroleum education at NTNU. The department has elected chairman and vice chairman, and 4 informal groups of professors; geophysics, drilling, production and reservoir engineering. The stated primary purpose of maintaining the informal groups is to take care of the teaching in their respective disciplines. Each group is responsible for offering a sufficient number of courses, semester projects and thesis projects at M.Sc. and Ph.D. levels in their discipline, and to make annual revisions of these in accordance with the needs of society and industry. The total number of professors, associate professors, assistant professors and adjunct professors is 32. The administrative staff is led by a department administrator, and consists of a total of 6 secretaries. The technical support staff reports to the department head, and consists of 8 engineers and technicians. Until 2000, the department was part of the Applied Earth Sciences faculty, together with the Geology-department. After that, the department is part of the Faculty of Engineering Science and Technology (one of a total of 10 departments). Brief historical statistics of the department: * Established in 1973 * More than 2000 graduated M.Sc.¬¥s * More than 150 graduated Ph.D.¬¥s * Around 120 M.Sc.¬¥s graduate every year * Around 10 Ph.D.¬¥s graduate every year * Currently around 120 full-time teachers, researchers and staff * Around 450 students enrolled at B.Sc. and M.Sc. levels * Around 65 PhD students enrolled  Research  The department focus research within the following 5 areas: Petroleum geophysics, Reservoir engineering, Production engineering, Subsea engineering, Drilling engineering and Integrated operations. Petroleum Geophysics: * Marine seismic sources * Seismic tomography and imaging * Inversion for elastic parameters (AVA) and reservoir parameters * Reservoir seismic and rock physics * Analysis of repeated seismic data (four-dimensional) * Processing of marine controlled source electromagnetic data * Modelling and characterization of anisotropic layered media (seismic and EM) Reservoir Engineering: * Experimental studies on novel methods for improved oil recovery, like chemical flooding, non-hydrocarbon gas flooding and microbial flooding * Development of improved methods for numerical simulation of enhanced oil recovery processes in conventional, fractured and heterogeneous reservoirs * Development of improved techniques for interpretation of well tests, specially related to compressible reservoirs * Development of phase-behaviour software for non-hydrocarbon injection gases for enhanced oil recovery Production Engineering * Multiphase flow in wells and pipelines * Pumping and artificial lift * Flow assurance and condition monitoring * Hydrate for transport of natural gas * Processing of oil and gas * Field development Subsea Engineering: * All-electric subsea control systems including electrical connectors and valve actuators * Experimental and numerical studies of near well bore formation damage related to balanced drilling Drilling engineering: * Horizontal drilling * Electric pulse drilling * Improved drilling fluid properties * Managed pressure drilling Integrated operations: The department hosts the Center for Integrated Operations in the Petroleum Industry. Key research areas are drilling, reservoir management, production optimization, operation and maintenance.  International  The department states that it intends to be strongly focused on the international profile with a friendly multi-cultural atmosphere. From the very beginning the international atmosphere existed at IPT in the form of teachers, researchers and students from various countries. IPT has been actively cooperating with countries like Angola, Aserbadjan, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, Mozambique, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, USA, Venezuela; altogether more than 50 countries. There are two 2-years international programs leading to Master's degrees, one in Petroleum Engineering and one in Petroleum Geoscience. Exchange students may take shorter term education within this program. In addition Ph.D-positions are open to qualified international candidates. These positions also constitute the basis for international research cooperation. Professors have individual scientific cooperation with various foreign institutions. The funding comes from Norwegian agencies SIU (NORAD, QUOTA), EnPe (NORAD, QUOTA), The Research Council of Norway, oil companies Statoil, Total, BP, and NTNU Scholarships; also from European Programs (Erasmus, Marie Curie, TIME, Socrates) and others. IPT cultivates personal international contacts as originators of new collaboration. Graduated Ph.D.s represent a particular bridging potential for new joint research.  Innovation  New companies, on average one new company each year, are founded by professors and/or students, including: Agir Boosting Technology, Geoprobing Technology, DeepSeaAnchors, Markland Technology, Natural Gas Hydrate, PERA, Petrostreamz, Petreco, ResLab, Corrocean, Sensorlink, Seres, Technoguide, Verande, Voxelvision, Waptheweb.

He has equally been identified with a Toussaint Barr√©, builder of the main workshop for manufacturing Indienne-style cotton goods, founded by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf at Jouy-en-Josas. Barr√© (Seine-Port, Seine-et-Marne, January 22, 1735 - Seine-Port 27 January 1824) was a French architect. He was one of the most important architects of the 18th century and one of the creators of the 'Louis XVI style' of architecture. Biography Jean Beno√Æt Vincent Barr√© learned architecture in the school of Antoine Matthieu Le Carpentier, from whom he also derived part of his clientele. He worked for very rich patrons, erecting sumptuous and elegant buildings, perfectly fitted to the taste of the day. His career nevertheless remains little known. He worked for financiers like Laurent Grimod de La Reyni√®re, for whom he built the famous H√¥tel Grimod de La Reyni√®re in Paris, Jean-Joseph de LabordeClient of Le Carpentier in his famous ch√¢teau de La Fert√©-Vidame or for Laborde's father-in-law, Mathias de Nettine, banker at the Austrian court. Through Nettine's influence, he was commissioned to build Brussels's \\"place royale\\", church of Saint-Jacques-de-Coudenberg, and French embassy. In 1770 he was named inspector of the buildings for the king's gunpowder and saltpeter, during which appointment he built his best-known work, the ch√¢teau du Marais (1772‚Äì1779), for Jean Le Ma√Ætre de La Martini√®re, treasurer-general of the artillery. For Louis Georges √ârasme de Contades, mar√©chal de Contades, he rebuilt the ch√¢teau de Montgeoffroy, in Anjou. Underrated by his fellow architects, only one other backed his presenting himself to the Royal Academy of Architecture. Barr√© in 1772 gave himself over to property speculation in the Nouvelle France quartier of Paris, in association with Jean-Fran√ßois Perrin de Cypierre, intendent of the g√©n√©ralit√© of Orl√©ans. Later he speculated in association with Antoine Roy, who married Barr√©'s daughter Ad√©la√Øde-Sophie in 1793 and had two daughters by her.Laure, who married the marquis de Talhouet, beginning the Talhouet-Roy line which still owns the ch√¢teau du Lude; and √âlisa, countess of Lariboisi√®re, founder of the hospital of the same name. (Roy made a great fortune and became finance minister upon the Bourbon Restoration.) In 1797, Barr√© retired to his property of La Chesnaye at Seine-Port where he died of old age in 1824.

They returned home on Monday, September 10, at 5 pm (EST). While Beamer could have left that night for a Tuesday business meeting in California, he opted instead to spend time with his family. His wife was due the following January with their third child. He left home at 6:15 am the next morning, to take an early flight from Newark to San Francisco to meet with representatives of the Sony Corporation at 1:00pm, planning to return on a red-eye flight that night. United Flight 93 was scheduled to depart at 8:00am, but the Boeing 757 did not depart until 42 minutes later due to runway traffic delays. Four minutes later, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center's North Tower. 17 minutes later, at 9:03 am, as United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, United 93 was climbing to cruising altitude, heading west over New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. At 9:25 am, Flight 93 was above eastern Ohio, and its pilot radioed Cleveland controllers to inquire about an alert that had been flashed on his cockpit computer screen to \\"beware of cockpit intrusion.\\" Three minutes later, Cleveland controllers could hear screams over the cockpit's open microphone. Moments later, the hijackers, led by the Lebanese Ziad Samir Jarrah, took over the plane's controls, disengaged the autopilot, and told passengers, \\"Keep remaining sitting (sic). We have a bomb on board.\\" Beamer and the other passengers were herded into the back of the plane. Within six minutes, the plane changed course and was heading for Washington, D.C.. Several of the passengers made phone calls to loved ones, who informed them about the two planes that had crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City and the third into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. Beamer tried to place a credit card call through a phone located on the back of a plane seat, but was routed to a customer-service representative, who passed him on to GTE airphone supervisor Lisa Jefferson. With FBI agents listening in on their call, Beamer informed Jefferson that hijackers had taken over United 93, and that one passenger had been killed. He also stated that two of the hijackers had knives, and that one appeared to have a bomb strapped around his waist.

Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to \\"jump on\\" the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, \\"If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them.\\" After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, \\"Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll.\\" These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.

Pull it down!\\" At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, \\"Hey! Hey! Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me.

Unlike most duomos it is not in fact a cathedral, as Monza has always been part of the Diocese of Milan, but is in the charge of an archpriest who has the right to certain episcopal vestments including the mitre and the ring. The church is also known as the Basilica of San Giovanni Battista from its dedication to John the Baptist. History The basilica, which would in essence have been completed by 603 when heir to the Lombard throne Adaloald was baptised here by Secundus of Non, is believed to have been commissioned towards the end of the sixth century by the Lombard Queen of Italy, Theodelinda, as a royal chapel to serve the nearby palace.‚ÄòStoria del Duomo di Monza: Dalle origini al ‚Äô300‚Äô, Basilica di S. Giovanni Battista. According to the legend she had made a vow to build a church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, and when riding along the banks of the Lambro River, she was halted by a dove who told her Modo (Latin for \\"now\\"), to which she replied Etiam (\\"yes\\"). Monza itself was initially known as Modoetia. In 595, she had a oraculum (chapel) built on the Greek Cross plan; of this chapel only the walls exist today. The queen was buried here, in what is now the central left aisle of the church. On the remains of the oraculum, a new church was erected in the 13th century. It was again rebuilt as a basilica, starting from 1300, on a Latin Cross plan with an octagonal tiburium. In the late 14th century, the side chapels were added and, as designed by Matteo da Campione, the Pisan-Gothic style west front in white and green marble was begun. Starting from the 16th century, the choir and the ceiling were restored. Subsequently, the walls and the vaults were decorated with frescoes and stucco-work. The bell tower was erected in 1606. In the 18th century a cemetery was annexed on the left side. Lunette over the portal West front The massive west front is divided into five parts by six lesene (applied strips), each of which is surmounted by a tabernacle housing a statue. The fa√ßade has several mullioned windows with, in the centre, a large rose window framed by a motif inspired by Roman antique ceilings, decorated with rosettes, masks and star motifs. The rose window Frescoes in the Theodelinda Chapel The fa√ßade is considered Romanesque in its structure and Gothic in its decoration. Typical of the latter is the porch, with 14th century gargoyles on the sides and the 13th century lunette with the 16th century busts of Theodelinda and King Agilulf. Over the porch is the statue of Saint John the Baptist (15th century). Over the portal is depicted the Baptism of Jesus, assisted by Saint Peter, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Zachary and Saint Paul. In the upper section is portrayed Theodelinda offering to John the Baptist the Iron Crown of Lombardy, together with her kneeling husband Agilulf and their children Adaloald and Gundeberga. Interior The church has a nave and two aisles, separated by octagonal columns with Romanesque capitals and round columns with Baroque capitals. It ends in large apses, and has a series of chapels opening into the aisles. The wall decoration is overwhelmingly Baroque. Other artworks include a choir by Matteo da Campione, the high altar by Andrea Appiani, and the presbytery and transept frescoes by Giuseppe Meda and Giuseppe Arcimboldi. =Treasury= In the right transept is the entrance to the Serpero Museum which houses the treasury with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, and the Late Antique ivory Poet and Muse diptych, of about 500, as well as an internationally important collection of late antique and early medieval works of various kinds, many deposited by Theodelinda herself. These include small metal 6th century ampullae from the Holy Land which are evidence of the emerging iconography of medieval art, among them the earliest depictions of the treatments of the Crucifixion and Nativity of Jesus in art that were to become standard throughout the Middle Ages and beyond.Hahn, 9-16 Only Bobbio has an equivalent collection of ampullae. The library holds a number of old and important illuminated manuscripts. Theodelinda Chapel Apart the Iron Crown, the most famous attraction of the church is the Chapel of Theodelinda. It has 15th-century frescoes from the Zavattari workshop depicting the stories of the queen's life, such as the dove episode, her marriage proposal, her meeting with her first husband, Authari, the latter's death in battle, and her new marriage with Agilulf. All the figures are portrayed with rich garments typical of the Visconti era. The vault is decorated with 14th century figures of saints and evangelists enthroned. On the outer arch are depicted Theodelinda with her court venerating Saint John the Baptist. The Alabardieri guard An ancient and unusual privilege of the Duomo is its right to employ ceremonial armed guards, rather on the line of the Papal Swiss Guard at the Vatican. Known as Alabardieri from the halberds they carry, the date of their institution is described in a 1763 edict of Maria Theresa of Austria as ‚Äòimmemorial‚Äô.

The DAHANCA group‚Äôs activities have included creating and running a national quality database, development of treatment guidelines, performing numerous national clinical protocol studies ( more than 38), and providing quality assurance programs. The group is multidisciplinary and consists of representatives from all the oncology centers in Denmark (and some in Norway) treating head and neck cancer, including oncologists, otolaryngologists, pathologists, imaging diagnosticians, experimental researchers, epidemiologists, and other expert support, eg, medical physicists. The DAHANCA model was behind the establishment of the structure of the Danish Multidisciplinary Cancer Groups (DMCG), and the DAHANCA group is thus the oldest of the still active DMCG.

A former amateur champion, he turned professional in 1995, reaching the top makuuchi division in 2000. His highest rank was komusubi. He retired in 2008 and is now a sumo coach. Career Tochinohana practised amateur sumo at Meiji University, but unlike many former amateur wrestlers, he still began his professional career at the very bottom of the rankings. He joined Kasugano stable in March 1995 at the age of 22. Initially fighting under his own surname, Yachi, it took him four years to become a sekitori. Upon reaching the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in January 1999 he adopted the shikona Tochinohana. After capturing the j≈´ry≈ç y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship with a 13-2 record, he made his debut in the top makuuchi division in May 2000. There he defeated ozeki Chiyotaikai and Takanonami, finished in equal third place with 12 wins against three losses and received two special prizes for Fighting Spirit and Technique. In the September 2000 tournament he defeated another ozeki and was awarded his second Technique prize. He was promoted to komusubi in the next tournament in November, but could only manage a 3-12 record. This was to be his only tournament in the titled sanyaku ranks. Over the next couple of years Tochinohana struggled to maintain his makuuchi position, and a serious back injury forced him all the way down to the unsalaried makushita division in 2004. However, he fought his way back to makuuchi in November 2005, where he finished runner-up to yokozuna Asashoryu, scoring eleven wins and receiving the Fighting Spirit Award. In an interview, Tochinohana's father said he regarded this as the most memorable achievement of his son's career. He remained in the top division until May 2007, when he could only win only four bouts at maegashira 13 and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç. Retirement from sumo After a disastrous 2-13 record in November 2007 Tochinohana fell to J≈´ry≈ç 14 West, making him the lowest ranking sekitori. In January 2008, after losing nine of his first twelve bouts, he announced his retirement. He has stayed with the Sumo Association as an toshiyori, or elder, under the name Hatachiyama, and is working as a coach at Kasugano stable. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony, was held jointly with his stablemate Tochisakae at the Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan in January 2009. Fighting style Tochinohana's most common winning kimarite was a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out, and he preferred a migi yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi. He also regularly won with oshi-dashi, or push out.

Early life and education Emmy Andriesse was the only child of liberal Jews Abraham Andriesse and Else Fuld, both working in textile companies. At age fifteen, she lost her mother, and since her father traveled internationally for work, she was raised by several aunts. From 1932 to 1937, after high school, Andriesse studied advertising design at the Academy of Fine Arts in The Hague founded in 1929 by designer . At the academy she belonged to a group of students around left-wing designer Paul Schuitema. She attended an experimental class taught by Paul Schuitema and Gerrit Kiljan, where she learnt photography and the use of photographs in posters, advertising and newspaper articles. In her final years of study, she lived in Voorburg in a 'community house' together with a group of politically conscious fellow students. Amongst the 15 or so residents were photographer Hans Wolf and academics Eva Loeb, Hans Ijzerman and Lex Metz. In this environment Andriesse and her friends came into contact with International Red Aid and various anti-fascist artists' organizations.  War years and the 'Underground Camera'  In June 1941 Andriesse married graphic designer and visual artist Dick Elffers (a gentile with whom she had two sons, one who died young), but as a Jew during the Nazi occupation Andriesse was no longer able to publish and she was forced into hiding. At the end of 1944, with the assistance of the anthropologist she forged an identity card and re- engaged in everyday life, joining a group of photographers, including Cas Oorthuys and Charles Breijer, working clandestinely as De Ondergedoken Camera. The photos that Andriesse made under very difficult conditions of famine in Amsterdam, include Boy with pan, The Gravedigger and Kattenburg Children are documents of hunger, poverty and misery during the occupation in the \\"winter of hunger\\" of 1944-1945.

She participated in the group show Photo '48 and in 1952, together with , Eva Besny√∂ and Cas Oorthuys, the exhibition Photographie, both in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. Edward Steichen chose her 1947 portrait of a staid and elderly Dutch couple for the section 'we two form a multitude' in the Museum of Modern Art world-touring The Family of Man that was seen by an audience of 9 million. More recently (October 2006-January 2007) she was included in a display of Twentieth Century European photography at the Barbican Art Gallery, London. Andriesse's last commission, the book The World of Van Gogh - published posthumously in 1953 - was not yet complete when she became ill and after a long battle with cancer, died at the age of 39.

His highest rank was sekiwake. A former amateur sumo champion, he turned professional in 2004, reaching the top division two years later. Until his promotion to komusubi in May 2014 he had the active record for the longest serving makuuchi wrestler who had never reached a titled rank. His best performance in a tournament came in July 2015 when he was the runner-up and scored twelve wins against three losses. In the following tournament in September 2015 he defeated two yokozuna and won special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. Yoshikaze is in second place for the slowest promotion from makuuchi debut to the third highest sekiwake rank in history, behind only his stablemate Takekaze. He won ten special prizes in total, and eight gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He retired in September 2019 and is now an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, known as Nakamura Oyakata. Early life and sumo background He was an amateur sumo champion at Nippon Sport Science University, and won the college equivalent of the yokozuna title in his third year. Because he wanted to wait until after his graduation from university before joining professional sumo, he missed out on the chance to enter at the level of the third makushita division. He joined Oguruma stable and made his debut at maezumo level in January 2004, the first former amateur yokozuna to do so. Career At the start of his career he was considerably older and more experienced than most of the competition there and quickly worked his way up the ranks, winning two tournament titles in the jonokuchi and sandanme divisions with perfect 7‚Äì0 records. He initially competed under his own surname of ≈ånishi, but upon reaching the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in July 2005 he changed his shikona to Yoshikaze. The Yoshi character came from his grandfather, Yoshio, who had died the previous year, and the kaze character was from his stablemaster and used by many of his stablemates. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division in January 2006. It took him only 12 tournaments to make the top division from his professional debut, equal to the second fastest rise ever since the six tournaments per year system was introduced in 1958. However, until January 2009 he did not manage to rise above the mid maegashira ranks and twice fell back to the second division. In the November 2007 tournament he defeated fan favourite Takamisakari with the rare but spectacular technique of utchari, or spin throw from the edge of the ring. However he was able to win only three other bouts in that tournament and fell to the bottom of the division. An 8‚Äì7 record in January 2008 kept him in makuuchi. Yoshikaze in May 2009. One of his best performance in the top division came in November 2008 when he won 11 bouts and was awarded his first sansh≈ç or special prize, for Fighting Spirit. He was promoted to a new high of maegashira 2 for the January 2009 tournament. Although he was not able to come through with a winning record his score of 6‚Äì9 was creditable, and he scored a memorable win over new ≈çzeki Harumafuji on the opening day of the tournament. However, he gradually slipped back down the rankings with three more losing scores in the next three tournaments. The November 2009 tournament was one of his most successful, as he won nine of his first ten bouts before slowing down somewhat to finish on 10‚Äì5. In September 2010 he won his second Fighting Spirit prize, which was shared with his stablemate Takekaze, after producing a fine 11‚Äì4 score, having been 7‚Äì0. He followed up with a solid 8‚Äì7 record in November, which saw him return to maegashira 2 in January 2011, and he reached maegashira 1 that July. In March 2014 Yoshikaze scored 10‚Äì5 from maegashira 4. This not only saw him win his third Fighting Spirit Prize, but also guaranteed him promotion to the san'yaku ranks for the first time, as all the maegashira above him on the banzuke had losing scores. His promotion to komusubi in the May 2014 tournament ended his record as the active wrestler with the longest career in makuuchi without ever making a san'yaku appearance (47 tournaments). He managed a 6‚Äì9 at this rank, and though this would lead to a demotion, it is considered relatively strong showing for a wrestler debuting at this challenging rank. In the following July tournament in Nagoya, he defeated yokozuna Harumafuji for the second tournament in a row, this time earning his first kinboshi as he was back in the maegashira ranks. He added a second kinboshi in September by beating Kakury≈´ but ended the tournament with a losing record and withdrew from the November tournament after winning only four of his first twelve matches. In early 2015 Yoshikaze dropped to maegashira 14 after losing records in five of the last six tournaments. He recovered in May however, with a 10‚Äì5 result and then produced a career-best makuuchi score at Nagoya in July, finishing with 12‚Äì3 and earning a fourth Fighting Spirit prize. His excellent form continued in September 2015 when his eleven wins from maegashira 1 included victories over both competing yokozuna, Hakuh≈ç and Kak≈´ry≈´. He was additionally awarded the special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. Yoshikaze returned to the rank of komusubi for the November 2015 tournament and defeated Kak≈´ry≈´ for the second time in a row on the opening day. He went on to post wins over both sekiwake and the ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç to end the tournament with an 8‚Äì7 record. He was awarded the special prize for Technique for the second consecutive tournament. His efforts saw him promoted to the rank of sekiwake for the first time, 59 tournaments after his top division debut. This is the second slowest in history, behind only fellow Oguruma stable member Takekaze, who took 68 tournaments to reach sekiwake. Yoshikaze achieved a majority of wins in his debut at sekiwake, but lost the rank after the following tournament where he could only score 4‚Äì11. He earned his fifth career gold star in the July 2016 tournament by defeating Harumafuji for the eighth time in thirteen meetings. Despite suffering from facial injuries he ended the tournament with a 10‚Äì5 record and was awarded the special prize for Outstanding Performance. In the March 2017 tournament he earned his sixth kinboshi by defeating Kakury≈´ on Day 10. Returning to the sanyaku ranks at komusubi in May 2017, he defeated two yokozuna, Kisenosato and Kakury≈´, in the first four days, and received his third Technique Prize at the end of the tournament. He produced another good performance in July 2017, beating Harumafuji on the opening day and ending with a 9‚Äì6 record: he was in consideration for another Technique prize before losing to the in-form Aoiyama on the final day. This returned him to sekiwake rank for the first time since March 2016. He became the fifth oldest wrestler post World War II to earn promotion to sekiwake at 35 years, 5 months. He was demoted from sekiwake after the November 2017 tournament, but back in the maegashira ranks in January 2018 he defeated two yokozuna on consecutive days ‚Äì Hakuh≈ç on Day 4 and Kisenosato on Day 5. After having surgery on a knee injury in June 2019, he announced that he would miss the July 2019 tournament, resulting in a fall to j≈´ry≈ç for the first time since 2007. Retirement from sumo In February 2013 Yoshikaze acquired the Nakamura toshiyori kabu or elder stock from the former Fujizakura, indicating that he intended to stay in sumo as a coach upon his retirement. On the fifth day of the September 2019 tournament, with his continuing absence making demotion to the makushita division certain, he submitted his retirement papers to the Japan Sumo Association. It was reported in October that his career-ending knee injury was caused by a canyoning accident in his native Saiki. Fighting style Yoshikaze's favourite techniques are listed at the Sumo Association as tsuki/oshi, meaning he preferred pushing and thrusting moves as opposed to fighting on the opponent's mawashi or belt. His most common winning techniques were oshidashi, the push out, and yorikiri, the force out. Family Yoshikaze was married in December 2008, and the wedding ceremony was held in October 2009. He has two children, a daughter and a son.

The genus was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in 1818. The sole species in the genus is Leucophyta brownii, also known as cushion bush. In 1891 German botanist Otto Kuntze assigned a number of species to this genus in his publication Revisio Generum Plantarum but none of his name combinations have currency, these species being presently divided between the genera Balladonia, Blennospora, Calocephalus and Gnephosis. Leucophyta brownii is a small, rounded shrub with tangled tomentose branchlets that give it a silvery appearance. Although it can grow up to 1 metre high, it is more usually 0.2 to 0.7 metres high. It produces flowers during summer (December to February in Australia). These are white - yellow globular heads and about 1 cm in diameter. The species is common in cultivation in Australia, with a selected dwarf form from Tasmania, known by the cultivar name 'Silver Nugget', also grown. Habitat Leucophyta brownii is found in coastal environments. It commonly occurs on the exposed faces of cliffs and dunes on the south coast of Australia. It is highly tolerant of prevailing winds, sea spray, drought and frost and grows on predominantly sand or sandstone derived soil. Further, the soil can be highly alkaline (where sand is composed of calcium carbonate). It grows most successfully in full sun. Sorrento, Victoria.

W≈Çodzimierz Zag√≥rski of the Clan of OstojaBiogramy (born January 21, 1882 in Saint-Martin-Lantosque, France ‚Äì disappeared August 6, 1927 en route from Wilno to Warsaw) was an Austro-Hungary military intelligence soldier, Polish brigadier general, staff officer, and aviator. Youth W≈Çodzimierz Zag√≥rski was born in Saint-Martin-Lantosque, France, near the city of Nice. He was born into nobility, specifically the Clan of Ostoja. His father was Jan Zag√≥rski, one of many representatives of the noble Zag√≥rski family living throughout Masovia, Warsaw, Lubelszczyzna, Lublin, and Cracow. Jan Zag√≥rski was an active member of the January Uprising in 1863-1864, who as a result of his participation in the Uprising, was deported to Siberia only to escape and flee afterwards to France. W≈Çodzimierz Zag√≥rski's mother was Anna Koz≈Çow, a dame of the House of Romanov and daughter of General Kozlov. W≈Çodziemierz Zag√≥rski experienced extensive schooling in many various subjects while living in France. He graduated both legal and trade schools in France and Austria. He spoke fluently six languages, including French and German, and financed his own aviation training when the industry was just being popularized. Military Service in the Austro- Hungarian Army and the Polish Legions during World War I Zag√≥rski began his military service in 1900 in the Austro-Hungarian Army. On August 18, 1902, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant of Artillery. In 1910, he graduated from the General Staff Academy in Vienna and was promoted to Chief of Staff of the 8th Infantry Brigade of the Austro-Hungarian Army in Cracow. In 1911, he was transferred to the (Evidenzbureau) of the Austro-Hungarian Army, where he was responsible for leading irregular warfare in the Vistula Land, aimed at destabilizing said region of the Russian Empire. Zag√≥rski was appointed as an official in the Second Branch of the General Staff in Vienna, where he commanded the so-called Hauptkundschaftstellen in Cracow, Przemy≈õl, and Lw√≥w. The Hauptkundschaftstellen was the governing body of the Evidenzbureau which commanded Austrian-sponsored Polish paramilitary and intelligence-gathering organizations in the Vistula Land. One of the commanders of such organizations Zag√≥rski came into contact with was J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Pi≈Çsudski would gather and transfer intelligence over to Zag√≥rski in exchange for Austrian funds which helped establish and expand Polish paramilitary capabilities in the Vistula Land - one such example being the Riflemen's Association. Zag√≥rski as Chief of Staff with his officers, 1914 During the first two years of World War I, Zag√≥rski was promoted to Captain and appointed Chief of Staff of the Polish Legions. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski opposed Zag√≥rski's appointment as Chief of Staff, as Pi≈Çsudski was interested in re-constructing an independent Poland while Zag√≥rski proved stubbornly loyal to Emperor Franz Joseph I. The Austrian Emperor would have opposed the breakaway of Polish-populated Austrian territories. As a result, Zag√≥rski proved terribly difficult to work with, having created enemies with Pi≈Çsudski, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, and even members of the Austrian Army's High Command due to his extreme loyalty towards the Austrian Emperor. Zagorski in the Polish Legion, by Wincenty Wodzinowski From June 1916 to July 1917, Zag√≥rski served as commander of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Polish Legions. The Oath Crisis took place during this time period, where Zag√≥rski pledged his allegiance to the Central Powers, in contrast to the vast majority of his soldiers who did not. He imprisoned several of his soldiers and ordered for them not to be fed. When none of the prisoners complied with Zag√≥rski's demand to pledge allegiance to the Central Powers, he ordered the soldiers to march shoe-less to an internment camp in Szczypiorno. Later, it was often recalled by the Polish Legions that as the column of shoe-less Poles marched past a furious Zag√≥rski, the Polish soldiers bellowed out in unison the lyrics to \\"We Are the First Brigade\\", and added a fifth verse to the song where they verbally attacked Zag√≥rski, ending the song with telling Zag√≥rski to \\"go f--- yourself\\". Bohdan Urbankowski, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, marzyciel i strateg, Warszawa 1997 As a result, Zag√≥rski denounced several Polish Legion officers at the internment camp who entered undercover as regular soldiers with the aim of dividing the sentences among the imprisoned. Those denounced by Zag√≥rski were transferred to another internment camp in Havelberg, where they were brutally treated, and even tortured. From July 1917 to February 1918, Zag√≥rski served as the commander of the 1st Light Artillery Regiment of the Polish Auxiliary Corps. Ma≈Ça encyklopedia wojskowa, Warszawa, 1970, t. II, s. 723. After the successful break-through of the II Brigade at the Battle of Rara≈Ñcza, Zag√≥rski was removed from the Polish Legions for plotting against the Austrian Army. He was interned at Khust, and later court-martialed. His sentence was quickly nullified due to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Despite having served in the Polish Legions, many within the Legions denounced Zag√≥rski for his loyalty towards the Habsburg Emperors instead of his fellow Polish countrymen. Service in the Polish Armed Forces During the formation of the Polish Armed Forces in late October 1918, Zag√≥rski was appointed Vice-Chief of the Polish Army's General Staff. However, on November 10 - only three weeks later - he was forced to resign. He was recalled to the Army at the start of Polish- Soviet border conflicts which soon erupted into the Polish-Bolshevik War. During the war, he was Chief of Staff of the Polish Northern Front, which was then led by General J√≥zef Haller.

On April 9, 1921, Zag√≥rski asked of his own accord to be transferred to the Polish Army Reserves. Dziennik Personalny M.S.Wojsk. Nr 16 z 23.04.1921 r. From April 1921 to March 1923, Zag√≥rski was enlisted in the reserves, and spent most of his time working for Francopol - a company which purchased and imported French-made aeroplanes for the Polish Army. In March 1923, the Minister to Military Affairs, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, called Zag√≥rski up from the reserves and appointed him Chief of the Military Production Department to the Army.

Cynk: Polskie lotnictwo wosjkowe na rozdro≈ºu in Skrzydlata Polska 9/2006, pp. 51‚Äì52 An important figure in the development of the Polish air force, he attempted during this time period to implement a controversial armament program for the air force created by Fran√ßois-L√®on Leveque, a French officer who commanded the Polish Army's air force up until December 1922. The program called for the import of French-made aircraft to arm nearly 50 squadrons. Large amounts of credit were loaned by the French in exchange for purchase of French aircraft for the Polish air force. The rapid enforcing of the program by Zag√≥rski resulted in the purchase of a large number of French aircraft through the Francopol company. By 1925, in terms of the number of aircraft, the Poles were considered a European aerial powerhouse. On the other hand, the quick purchase of such a vast number of aircraft overshadowed the fact that Poland lacked trained pilots to fly the newly purchased aircraft, lacked the proper facilities to base the aircraft in, and lacked properly trained technicians to service the aircraft. As a result, although Poland had a threatening force on paper, squadrons of airplanes rusted away, and along with it Poland's aerial potential. Additionally, despite having acquired reliable and superior aircraft such as the Breguet XIX or Potez XXV, Poland also purchased aircraft considered to be outdated, inferior, and marred with poor service and safety records, such as the SPAD S.61 or Farman F.68 Goliath. From January 1926, Zag√≥rski came under attack from Pi≈Çsudskiites in the government and military - including generals Daniel Konarzewski and Lucjan ≈ªeligowski, for having mismanaged the formation of the Polish air force through the participation of corrupt elements. Specifically, Zag√≥rski was attacked for the role of Francopol and French capital in the formation of the air force. Additionally, the argument was made that the native Polish aircraft industry has suffered drastically as a result of the purchase of French-made airplanes instead. On March 18, 1926, General ≈ªeligowski fired Zag√≥rski from his position as Chief of the Air Force in the War Ministry.Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 14 z 22 marca 1926 roku, s. 93. Zag√≥rski was heavily criticized by public media. He had been a shareholder in Francopol since 1921, yet all the purchases for the air force through Francopol - including the purchase of 100 aircraft engines and 100 Spad S.61 aircraft, was supervised and approved by the General Prosecutor of the National Treasury. Bohdan Urbankowski, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, marzyciel i strateg, Warszawa 1997. Pg.506 A wanted poster issued after Zag√≥rski's disappearance. He was accused of desertion from the Polish Army. May Coup of 1926 and Imprisonment During the May 1926 coup d'√©tat, Pi≈Çsudskiite forces attacked the legal government of Prime Minister Wincenty Witos. Loyal to the Witos Government, General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski ordered Zag√≥rski on May 12 to take command of the Warsaw Air Group from Ludomi≈Ç Rayski and to initiate bombing of pro-Pi≈Çsudski forces. Zag√≥rski was arrested in Warsaw on May 15, 1926, along with four other generals who had supported the legal government, including his superior General Rozwadowski. The five prisoners-of-war were imprisoned in Wilno. Zag√≥rski was accused to have had allegedly flown missions and personally bombed Pi≈Çsudski's force despite there being no evidence for these accusations. In October 1926, the five prisoners were cleared of all charges and approved for release, yet the army prosecutor lengthened their arrests instead, citing the prisoners to be threats to the interests of the Polish Army. A new round of charges were created against Zag√≥rski and his role in the Francopol Affair, although they were never brought up against him. Release and Disappearance Marian Zdziechowski - a prominent Pi≈Çsudskiite and professor at the Wilno University, publicly criticized the government's acceptance of lengthening the imprisonment period of the five prisoners. Zdziechowski's criticism had greatly influenced other Poles, and even members of Pi≈Çsudski's own circle, which in turn forced the government to release the prisoners due to public pressure. The five prisoners, including Zag√≥rski, were finally released from prison on August 6, 1927. Zag√≥rski was escorted to the Wilno train station in non-military public attire. At 8:20 am, train 714 heading to Warsaw from Wilno departed the station with Zag√≥rski on board. Zag√≥rski was supposed to meet with Marshal of Poland J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski first thing upon his arrival at Warsaw, yet Zag√≥rski did not arrive at his expected destination. Bohdan Urbankowski, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, marzyciel i strateg, Warszawa 1997. Pg.560-563 Press speculation abounded as to his disappearance, but in the end he was never seen again, nor his body ever found. Media at the time speculated that the former intelligence officer disappeared fearing another trial regarding the Francopol Affair; some historians allege that Zag√≥rski was murdered on the orders of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, yet there is no evidence to support such a thesis. To date, the whereabouts and fate of General Zag√≥rski are unknown and the sole charges that were brought up against him after his disappearance were for desertion from the Polish Army.

The group took part in a regulatory working group set up in response to UK government consultation on the implementation of the E-Money Directive. The group was then formalized into the EMA and its remit extended to issues of general interest to industry. The Financial Services Authority (now superseded by Financial Conduct Authority) proposed that the association develop a voluntary code of best practice for industry, addressing operational and non-operational risks and creating a minimum standard that could be adopted by issuers, irrespective of technology or market proposition. Role The Electronic Money Association (EMA) is the trade body for electronic money issuers and innovative payment service providers including payment institutions, banks, and payment schemes. It provides members with a forum to share their experiences and expertise around issues that impact new means of payment. It has taken part in negotiating several payment-related European Directives, regulations and legislation. The association works to develop industry good practice in compliance and customer service. Structure The Electronic Money Association meets and takes its decisions in plenary. All members have an equal say in discussions, in the activities of the association and in the decision-making process.

Root canals, and their associated pulp chamber, are the physical hollows within a tooth that are naturally inhabited by nerve tissue, blood vessels and other cellular entities. Together, these items constitute the dental pulp. Endodontic therapy involves the removal of these structures, disinfection and the subsequent shaping, cleaning, and decontamination of the hollows with small files and irrigating solutions, and the obturation (filling) of the decontaminated canals. Filling of the cleaned and decontaminated canals is done with an inert filling such as gutta-percha and typically a Zinc oxide eugenol-based cement. Epoxy resin is employed to bind gutta-percha in some root canal procedures. Another option is to use an antiseptic filling material containing paraformaldehyde like N2.(Venuti P. 2014) A dynamic prospective cohort study of initial endodontic treatments of 627 teeth: Long term results. International Journal of Dental and Health Sciences Volume 01,Issue 03. Endodontics includes both primary and secondary endodontic treatments as well as periradicular surgery which is generally used for teeth that still have potential for salvage.  Treatment procedure  The procedure is often complicated, depending on circumstances, and may involve multiple visits over a period of weeks. = Diagnostic and preparation = x-ray of a root canal operation DO decay. There was a carious exposure into the pulp chamber (red oval), and the photo was taken after endodontic access was initiated and the roof of the chamber was removed. Before endodontic therapy is carried out, a correct diagnosis of the dental pulp and the surrounding periapical tissues is required. This allows the endodontist to choose the most appropriate treatment option, allowing preservation and longevity of the tooth and surrounding tissues. Treatment options for an irreversibly inflamed pulp (irreversible pulpitis) include either extraction of the tooth or removal of the pulp. Removing the infected/inflamed pulpal tissue enables the endodontist to help preserve the longevity and function of the tooth. The treatment option chosen involves taking into account the expected prognosis of the tooth, as well as the patient's wishes. A full history is required (which includes the patient's symptoms and medical history), along with a clinical examination (both inside and outside the mouth), and the use of diagnostic tests There are several diagnostic tests that can aid in the diagnosis of the dental pulp and the surrounding tissues. These include: * Palpation (this is where the tip of the root is felt from the overlying tissues to see if there is any swelling or tenderness present) * Mobility (this is assessing if there is more than normal movement of the tooth in the socket) * Percussion (TTP, tender to percussion; the tooth is tapped to see if there is any tenderness) * Transillumination (shining a light through the tooth to see if there are any noticeable fractures) * Tooth Slooth (this is where the patient is asked to bite down upon a plastic instrument; useful if the patient complains of pain on biting as this can be used to localise the tooth) * Radiographs * Dental pulp tests In the situation that a tooth is considered so threatened (because of decay, cracking, etc.) that future infection is considered likely or inevitable, a pulpectomy (removal of the pulp tissue) is advisable to prevent such infection. Usually, some inflammation and/or infection is already present within or below the tooth. To cure the infection and save the tooth, the dentist drills into the pulp chamber and removes the infected pulp. To get freedom of bacteria the use of efficient antiseptics and disinfectants is necessary. One of the most effective is N2 root canal material which contains a small dose of paraformaldehyde. The nerve is either drilled out of the root canal(s)with engine driven files or with long needle-shaped hand instruments known as files (H files and K files). = Opening in the crown = The dentist makes an opening through the enamel and dentin tissues of the tooth, usually using a dental drill fitted with a dental burr. Isolating the tooth The use of a rubber dam for tooth isolation is mandatory in endodontic treatment for several reasons: # It provides an aseptic operating field, isolating the tooth from oral and salivary contamination. Root canal contamination with saliva introduces new microorganisms to the root canal which compromise the prognosis. # It facilitates the use of the strong medicaments necessary to clean the root canal system. # It protects the patient from the inhalation or ingestion of endodontic instruments. = Removal of pulp tissue =  Procedures for shaping  There have been a number of progressive iterations to the mechanical preparation of the root canal for endodontic therapy. The first, referred to as the standardized technique, was developed by Ingle in 1961, and had disadvantages such as the potential for loss of working length and inadvertent ledging, zipping or perforation. Subsequent refinements have been numerous, and are usually described as techniques. These include the step-back, circumferential filing, incremental, anticurvature filing, step- down, double flare, crown-down-pressureless, balanced force, canal master, apical box, progressive enlargement, modified double flare, passive stepback, alternated rotary motions, and apical patency techniques. The step back technique, also known as telescopic or serial root canal preparation, is divided in two phases: in the first, the working length is established and then the apical part of the canal is delicately shaped since a size 25 K-file reaches the working length; in the second, the remaining canal is prepared with manual or rotating instrumentation. This procedure, however, has some disadvantages, such as the potential for inadvertent apical transportation. Incorrect instrumentation length can occur, which can be addressed by the modified step back. Obstructing debris can be dealt with by the passive step back technique. The crown down is a procedure in which the dentist prepares the canal beginning from the coronal part after exploring the patency of the whole canal with the master apical file. There is a hybrid procedure combining step back and crown down: after the canal's patency check, the coronal third is prepared with hand or Gates Glidden drills, then the working length is determined and finally the apical portion is shaped using step back techniques. The double flare is a procedure introduced by Fava where the canal is explored using a small file. Then canal is prepared in crown down manner using K-files then follows a \\"step back\\" preparation with 1 mm increments with increasing file sizes. With early coronal enlargement, also described as \\"three times technique\\", apical canals are prepared after a working length assessment using an apex locator; then progressively enlarged with Gates Glidden drills (only coronal and middle third). For the eponymic third time the dentist \\"arrives at the apex\\" and, if necessary, prepares the foramen with a size 25 K-file; the last phase is divided in two refining passages: the first with a 1-mm staggered instrument, the second with 0.5-mm staggering. From the early nineties engine-driven instrumentation were gradually introduced including the ProFile system, the Greater Taper files, the ProTaper files, and other systems like Light Speed, Quantec, K-3 rotary, Real World Endo, and the Hero 642. All of these procedures involve frequent irrigation and recapitulation with the master apical file, a small file that reaches the apical foramen. High frequency ultrasound based techniques have also been described. These can be useful in particular for cases with complex anatomy, or for retained foreign body retrieval from a failed prior endodontic procedure. File:Step back.pngAn example of step back technique File:Passive step back.pngAn example of passive step back technique File:Crown down.pngAn example of crown down technique  Operative techniques for instruments  There are two slightly different anti-curvature techniques. In the balanced forces technique, the dentist inserts a file into the canal and rotates clockwise a quarter of a turn, engaging dentin, then rotates counter- clockwise half/ three-quarter of a revolution, applying pressure in an apical direction, shearing off tissue previously meshed. From the balanced forces stem two other techniques: the reverse balanced force (where GT instruments are rotated first anti-clockwise and then clockwise) and the gentler \\"feed and pull\\" where the instrument is rotated only a quarter of a revolution and moved coronally after an engagement, but not drawn out. =Use of Anesthetics= As of 2018, novocaine is most commonly used in dental procedures to numb the area around a tooth. During root canal treatment, novocaine is required even more than a simple filing. = Irrigation = The root canal is flushed with an irrigant. Some common ones are listed below: *Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) in concentrations ranging between 0.5% and 5.25% Raab D: Preparation of contaminated root canal systems ‚Äì the importance of antimicrobial irrigants.

Certain irrigants, such as sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine, have proved to be effective antimicrobials in vitro and are widely used during root canal therapy worldwide. According to a systematic review, however, there is a lack of good quality evidence to support the use of one irrigant over another in terms of both short and long term prognosis of therapy. Root canal irrigation systems are divided into two categories: manual agitation techniques and machine- assisted agitation techniques. Manual irrigation includes positive-pressure irrigation, which is commonly performed with a syringe and a side vented needle. Machine-assisted irrigation techniques include sonics and ultrasonics, as well as newer systems which deliver apical negative-pressure irrigation. = Filling the root canal = The standard filling material is gutta-percha, a natural polymer prepared from latex from the percha tree (Palaquium gutta). The standard endodontic technique involves inserting a gutta-percha cone (a \\"point\\") into the cleaned-out root canal along with a sealing cement. Another technique uses melted or heat-softened gutta-percha which is then injected or pressed into the root canal passage(s). However, since gutta-percha shrinks as it cools, thermal techniques can be unreliable and sometimes a combination of techniques is used. Gutta-percha is radiopaque, allowing verification afterwards that the root canal passages have been completely filled and are without voids. An alternative filling material was invented in the early 1950s by Angelo Sargenti. Filling material has undergone several formulations over the years (N2, N2 Universal, RC-2B, RC-2B White), but all contain paraformaldehyde. The paraformaldehyde, when placed into the root canal, forms formaldehyde, which penetrates and sterilizes the passage. The formaldehyde is then theoretically transformed into harmless water and carbon dioxide. According to some research, the outcome of this method is better than a root canal procedure performed with gutta-percha. There is, however, a lack of indisputable scientific studies according to the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment. Root canal sealer used to fill the spaces between the gutta-percha and the walls of root canal and between the gutta-percha cones In rare cases, the paste, like any other material, can be forced past the root tip into the surrounding bone. If this happens, the formaldehyde will immediately be transformed into a harmless substance. Blood normally contains 2 mg formaldehyde per liter and the body regulates this in seconds. The rest of an overfill will be gradually absorbed and the end result is normally good. In 1991, the ADA Council on Dental Therapeutics resolved that the treatment was \\"not recommended\\", and it is not taught in American dental schools. Scientific evidence in endodontic therapy was, and still is lacking. Despite this lack of support, the Sargenti technique has advocates who believe N2 to be less expensive and at least as safe as gutta-percha. Steup, 2001 [201] Treatment outcome. N2. The collected data indicates that the N2DONTIC Method according to Sargenti is classified as a successful method for endodontic therapy. Pain control can be difficult to achieve at times because of anesthetic inactivation by the acidity of the abscess around the tooth apex. Sometimes the abscess can be drained, antibiotics prescribed, and the procedure reattempted when inflammation has been mitigated. The tooth can also be unroofed to allow drainage and help relieve pressure. A root treated tooth may be eased from the occlusion as a measure to prevent tooth fracture prior to the cementation of a crown or similar restoration. Sometimes the dentist performs preliminary treatment of the tooth by removing all of the infected pulp of the tooth and applying a dressing and temporary filling to the tooth. This is called a pulpectomy. The dentist may also remove just the coronal portion of the dental pulp, which contains 90% of the nerve tissue, and leave intact the pulp in the canals. This procedure, called a \\"pulpotomy\\", tends to essentially eliminate all the pain. A pulpotomy may be a relatively definitive treatment for infected primary teeth. The pulpectomy and pulpotomy procedures aim to eliminate pain until the follow-up visit for finishing the root canal procedure. Further occurrences of pain could indicate the presence of continuing infection or retention of vital nerve tissue. Some dentists may decide to temporarily fill the canal with calcium hydroxide paste in order to thoroughly sterilize the site. This strong base is left in place for a week or more to disinfect and reduce inflammation in surrounding tissue, requiring the patient to return for a second or third visit to complete the procedure. There appears to be no benefit from this multi-visit option, however, and single- visit procedures actually show better (though not statistically significant) patient outcomes than multi-visit ones. = Temporary filling = A temporary filling material is applied between the visits. Leaky temporary filling will allow the root canals to become reinfected by bacteria in the saliva (coronal microleakage). Khayat et al. showed that all root canals obturated with gutta- percha and root canal sealer using either lateral or vertical condensation were recontaminated in less than 30 days when exposed to saliva. Therefore, maintaining a coronal seal throughout root canal therapy is very important for the success of the treatment. = Final restoration = Molars and premolars that have had root canal therapy should be protected with a crown that covers the cusps of the tooth. This is because the access made into the root canal system removes a significant amount of tooth structure. Molars and premolars are the primary teeth used in chewing and will almost certainly fracture in the future without cuspal coverage. Anterior teeth typically do not require full coverage restorations after a root canal procedure, unless there is extensive tooth loss from decay or for esthetics or unusual occlusion. Placement of a crown or cusp-protecting cast gold covering is recommended also because these have the best ability to seal the treated tooth. There is insufficient evidence to assess the effects of crowns compared to conventional fillings for the restoration of root-filled teeth, decision of restoration should rely on the clinical experience of the practitioner and the preference of the patients. If the tooth is not perfectly sealed, the canal may leak, causing eventual failure. A tooth with a root canal treatment still has the ability to decay, and without proper home care and an adequate fluoride source the tooth structure can become severely decayed (often without the patient's knowledge since the nerve has been removed, leaving the tooth without any pain perception). Thus, non-restorable carious destruction is the main reason for extraction of teeth after root canal therapy, accounting for up to two-thirds of these extractions. Therefore, it is very important to have regular X-rays taken of the root canal to ensure that the tooth is not having any problems that the patient would not be aware of. = Endodontic retreatment = Endodontic treatment may fail for many reasons: one common reason for failure is inadequate chemomechanical debridement of the root canal. This may be due to poor endodontic access, missed anatomy or inadequate shaping of the canal, particularly in the apical third of the root canal, also due to the difficulty of reaching the accessory canals which are minute canals that extend in from the pulp to the periodontium in a random direction. They are mostly found in the apical third of the root. Exposure of the obturation material to the oral environment may mean the gutta-percha is contaminated with oral bacteria. If complex and expensive restorative dentistry is contemplated then ideally the contaminated gutta percha would be replaced in a retreatment procedure to minimise the risk of failure. The type of bacteria found within a failed canal may differ from the normal infected tooth. Enterococcus faecalis and/or other facultative enteric bacteria or Pseudomonas sp. are found in this situation. Endodontic retreatment is technically demanding; it can be a time-consuming procedure, as meticulous care is required by the dentist. Retreatment cases are typically referred to a specialist endodontist. Use of an operating microscope or other magnification may improve outcomes.  Instruments and equipment used  Since 2000 there have been great innovations in the art and science of root canal therapy. Dentists now must be educated on the current concepts in order to optimally perform a root canal procedure. Root canal therapy has become more automated and can be performed faster thanks in part to machine-driven rotary technology and more advanced root canal filling methods. Many root canal procedures are done in one dental visit which may last for around 1‚Äì2 hours. Newer technologies are available (e.g. cone-beam CT scanning) that allow more efficient, scientific measurements to be taken of the dimensions of the root canal, however, the use of CT scanning in endodontics has to be justified. Many dentists use dental loupes to perform root canal therapy, and the consensus is that procedures performed using loupes or other forms of magnification (e.g. a surgical microscope) are more likely to succeed than those performed without them. Although general dentists are becoming versed in these advanced technologies, they are still more likely to be used by root canal specialist (known as endodontists). Laser root canal procedures are a controversial innovation. Lasers may be fast but have not been shown to thoroughly disinfect the whole tooth, and may cause damage. = Postoperative pain = Several randomized clinical trials concluded that the use of rotary instruments is associated with a lower incidence of pain following the endodontic procedure when compared to the use of manual hand instruments. Corticosteroid intra-oral injections were found to alleviate pain in the first 24 hours in patients suffering from symptomatic irreversible pulp inflammation.  Complications  = Instrument fractures = Instruments may separate (break) during root canal treatment, meaning a portion of the metal file used during the procedure remains inside the tooth. The file segment may be left behind if an acceptable level of cleaning and shaping has already been completed and attempting to remove the segment would risk damage to the tooth. While potentially disconcerting to the patient, having metal inside of a tooth is relatively common, such as with metal posts, amalgam fillings, gold crowns, and porcelain fused to metal crowns. The occurrence of file separation depends on the narrowness, curvature, length, calcification and number of roots on the tooth being treated. Complications resulting from incompletely cleaned canals, due to blockage from the separated file, can be addressed with surgical root canal treatment. To minimise the risk of endodontic files fracturing: * Ensure access cavity allows straight-line introduction of files into canals * Create a glide path before use of larger taper NiTi files * Use rotary instruments at the manufacturer's recommended speed and torque setting * Adopt a single-use file policy to prevent overuse of files *Inspecting the file thoroughly every time before inserting it inside the canal *Using ample amounts of irrigation solutions * Avoid use of rotary files in severely curved or dilacerated canals = Sodium hypochlorite accident = A sodium hypochlorite incident is an immediate reaction of severe pain, followed by edema, haematoma and ecchymosis, as a consequence of the solution escaping the confines of the tooth and entering the periapical space.Torabinejad, Mahmoud, Richard Walton. Endodontics, 4th Edition.Page 265. W.B. Saunders Company, 2008. VitalBook file This may be caused iatrogenically by binding or excessive pressure on the irrigant syringe or it may occur if the tooth has an unusually large apical foramen. It is usually self-resolving and may take two to five weeks to fully resolve. = Tooth discoloration = Tooth discoloration is common following root canal treatment; however, the exact causes for this are not completely understood. Failure to completely clean out the necrotic soft tissue of the pulp system may cause staining, and certain root canal materials (e.g. gutta percha and root canal sealer cements) can also cause staining. Another possible factor is that the lack of pulp pressure in dentinal tubules once the pulp is removed leads to incorporation of dietary stains in dentin. = Poor- quality root filling = X-ray explanation of bad root canal therapy Another common complication of root canal therapy is when the entire length of the root canal is not completely cleaned out and filled (obturated) with root canal filling material (usually gutta percha). The X-ray in the right margin shows two adjacent teeth that had received bad root canal therapy. The root canal filling material (3, 4 and 10) does not extend to the end of the tooth roots (5, 6 and 11). The dark circles at the bottom of the tooth roots (7 and 8) indicated infection in the surrounding bone. Recommended treatment is either to redo the root canal therapy if possible, or extract the tooth and place dental implants.  Outcome and prognosis  Root-canal-treated teeth may fail to heal‚Äîfor example, if the dentist does not find, clean and fill all of the root canals within a tooth. On a maxillary molar, there is more than a 50% chance that the tooth has four canals instead of just three, but the fourth canal, often called a \\"mesio-buccal 2\\", tends to be very difficult to see and often requires special instruments and magnification in order to see it (most commonly found in first maxillary molars; studies have shown an average of 76% up to 96% of such teeth with the presence of an MB2 canal). This infected canal may cause a continued infection or \\"flare-up\\" of the tooth. Any tooth may have more canals than expected, and these canals may be missed when the root canal procedure is performed. Sometimes canals may be unusually shaped, making them impossible to clean and fill completely; some infected material may remain in the canal. Sometimes the canal filling does not fully extend to the apex of the tooth, or it does not fill the canal as densely as it should. Sometimes a tooth root may be perforated while the root canal is being treated, making it difficult to fill the tooth. The perforation may be filled with a root repair material, such as one derived from natural cement called mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). A specialist can often re- treat failing root canals, and these teeth will then heal, often years after the initial root canal procedure. However, the survival or functionality of the endodontically treated tooth is often the most important aspect of endodontic treatment outcomes, rather than apical healing alone. Recent studies indicate that substances commonly used to clean the root canal space incompletely sterilize the canal. A properly restored tooth following root canal therapy yields long-term success rates near 97%. In a large-scale study of over 1.6 million patients who had root canal therapy, 97% had retained their teeth 8 years following the procedure, with most untoward events, such as re-treatment, apical surgery or extraction, occurring during the first 3 years after the initial endodontic treatment. Endodontically treated teeth are prone to extraction mainly due to non-restorable carious destruction, other times due to the improper fit of the crown margins that encircles the tooth which lead to the ingress of bacteria,Cohen Pathways of the Pulp, 9th ed., Copyright ¬© 2006 Mosby, An Imprint of Elsevier and to a lesser extent to endodontic-related reasons such as endodontic failure, vertical root fracture, or perforation (procedural error).  Systemic issues  Nondisruption of the periodontal fiber is a benefit of endodontic over implant therapy (labeled I‚ÄìK) An infected tooth may endanger other parts of the body. People with special vulnerabilities, such as a recent prosthetic joint replacement, an unrepaired congenital heart defect, or immunocompromisation, may need to take antibiotics to protect from infection spreading during dental procedures. The American Dental Association (ADA) asserts that any risks can be adequately controlled. A properly performed root canal treatment effectively removes the infected part of the pulp from the tooth. In the early 1900s, several researchers theorized that bacteria from teeth which had necrotic pulps or which had received endodontic treatment could cause chronic or local infection in areas distant from the tooth through the transfer of bacteria through the bloodstream. This was called the \\"focal infection theory\\", and it led some dentists to advocate dental extraction. In the 1930s, this theory was discredited, but the theory was recently revived by a book entitled Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed which used the early discredited research, and further complicated by epidemiological studies which found correlations between periodontal disease and heart disease, strokes, and preterm births. The book's author, George Meinig, has been a strong advocate against endodontic therapy for years; he has since lost his dental license for gross negligence and Root Canal Cover-Up Exposed has come under great criticism. Bacteremia (bacteria in the bloodstream) can be caused by many everyday activities, e.g. brushing teeth, but may also occur after any dental procedure which involves bleeding. It is particularly likely after dental extractions due to the movement of the tooth and force needed to dislodge it, but endodontically treated teeth alone do not cause bacteremia or systemic disease.  Alternatives  The alternatives to root canal therapy include no treatment or tooth extraction. Following tooth extraction, options for prosthetic replacement may include dental implants, a fixed partial denture (commonly referred to as a 'bridge'), or a removable denture. There are risks to forgoing treatment, including pain, infection and the possibility of worsening dental infection such that the tooth will become irreparable (root canal treatment will not be successful, often due to excessive loss of tooth structure). If extensive loss of tooth structure occurs, extraction may be the only treatment option. = Implant therapy versus endodontic therapy = Research comparing endodontic therapy with implant therapy is considerable, both as an initial treatment and in retreatment for failed initial endodontic approaches. Endodontic therapy allows avoidance of disruption of the periodontal fiber, which helps with proprioception for occlusal feedback, a reflex important in preventing patients from chewing improperly and damaging the temporomandibular joint. In a comparison of initial nonsurgical endodontic treatment and single-tooth implants, both were found to have similar success rates. While the procedures are similar in terms of pain and discomfort, a notable difference is that patients who have implants have reported \\"the worst pain of their life\\" during the extraction, with the implantation itself being relatively painless. The worst pain of endodontic therapy was reported with the initial anesthetic injection. Some patients receiving implants also describe a dull nagging pain after the procedure, while those with endodontic therapy describe \\"sensation\\" or \\"sensitivity\\" in the area. Other studies have found that endodontic therapy patients report the maximum pain the day following treatment, while extraction and implantation patients reported maximum pain the end of the week after the operation. Implants also take longer, with a typically 3- to 6-month gap between the tooth implantation and receiving the crown, depending on the severity of infection. With regard to gender, women tend to report higher psychological disability after endodontic therapy, and a higher rate of physical disability after tooth implantation, while men do not show a statistically significant difference in response. Mastication is significantly stronger in endodontically treated teeth as compared to implants. Initial success rates after single tooth implants and endodontic microsurgery are similar the first 2 to 4 years following surgery, though after this the success rate of endodontic microsurgery is decreased as compared to implantation. To an extent, the criteria for success due to the inherent differences in the procedure have historically limited comparisons, with success of endodontic therapy defined as the absence of periapical lucency on radiographs, or the absence of visible cavity at the root of the tooth on imaging. Implant success, on the other hand, is defined by osseointegration, or fusion of the implant to the adjacent maxilla or mandible. Endodontically treated teeth have significantly less requirement for follow up treatment after final restoration, while implants need more appointments to finish treatment and more maintenance. Socioeconomically, Americans of European descent and affluent patients tend to choose implant therapy, while African American and less affluent patients prefer endodontic therapy.

P√¢te-sur-p√¢te is a French term meaning \\"paste on paste\\". It is a method of porcelain decoration in which a relief design is created on an unfired, unglazed body, usually with a coloured body, by applying successive layers of (usually) white porcelain slip (liquid clay) with a brush. Once the main shape is built up, it is carved away to give fine detail, before the piece is fired. The work is very painstaking and may take weeks of adding extra layers and allowing them to harden before the next is applied.Godden, Geoffrey, English China, p. 58, 1985, Barrie & Jenkins, The usual colour scheme is a white relief on a contrasting coloured background, which in England was often Parian ware. The effect is somewhat similar to other types of relief decoration, in particular sprigging. However, unlike Jasperware, for example, a mould is not normally used, and the ceramic artist is able to achieve translucency. The method also gives results resembling cameos in stone or cameo glass. P√¢te-sur-p√¢te decoration by Henry Hollins, a former apprentice of Solon, on a pair of vases from Mintons, c. 1882. Birmingham Museum of Art The development of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te dates back to 1850 in France, and an accident that occurred at the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres. The company was trying to reproduce a decorative technique from a Chinese vase, but misinterpreting the vase, the experiment took them along a different path from the Chinese potter. They perfected what became known as p√¢te-sur-p√¢te. Marc-Louis Solon took the style to England, and others to Germany and Austria. The period within 15 years either side of 1900 was the heyday of the technique. Many pieces made in the State, formerly Imperial Porcelain Factory in Leningrad after World War II are said to use it, but are perhaps sprigged, then hand-finished. Bronislav Bystrushkin designed many, mostly using the classic Jasperware \\"Wedgwood blue\\" and white. Nineteenth century Berlin porcelain plate, 1900. Another notable maker was Marc-Louis Solon, who perfected the technique and was for most of his working life the leading exponent of the technique. Solon was born in France in 1835 and from an early age developed a considerable talent for art. Some of Solon's work later fell to the attention of the art director of S√®vres and he was soon after employed as a ceramic artist and designer. He was tasked along with H Regnault and Gelly to work upon the p√¢te-sur-p√¢te process which was still only at the trial stage. S√®vres reached a high level of refinement of their pottery. Praising the facilities of the day, Solon commented that \\"We were never limited as to time and cost\\", a luxury in any industry. Solon also began to produce pieces of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te in his own time under the name Miles, said to be based on his initials M L S. There are a number of these in the Victoria and Albert Museum's collection, as well as in the collection of the former Minton Museum. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 led Solon to flee his native country and seek refuge in England, where he established contact with Colin Minton Campbell of Mintons Ltd, Staffordshire. Mintons had a history of employing foreign artists. Its first Frenchman arrived in 1848, the art director L√©on Arnoux, followed by other French makers such as the sculptor Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, so Solon was joining a small continental community when he settled in Staffordshire and married Arnoux's daughter. The Solons brought up a large family at The Villas near the Mintons factory. To meet the demand for p√¢te-sur-p√¢te he was assigned English apprentices including Frederick Alfred Rhead. There ensued a golden age of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te in Stoke-on-Trent stretching into the early years of the 20th century. P√¢te- sur-p√¢te in the twentieth century Mintons vases designed by Solon in the p√¢te-sur-p√¢te style, 1880, on display at Mount Holyoke College Art Museum Minton remained the main producer of p√¢t√©-sur-p√¢t√© in the twentieth century, despite competition from other firms. However, Minton faced financial problems at the beginning of the twentieth century and p√¢t√©-sur-p√¢t√© became less important to the firm's output. After Solon retired, his son Leon Solon was art director at Minton, but he was associated with tube-lined Art Nouveau designs rather than p√¢te-sur-p√¢te. With Solon's death in 1913 and the advent of the First World War, an era had ended for p√¢te-sur-p√¢te. After the War its popularity declined like other nineteenth-century fashions. However, there was still some demand, and Minton continued to produce p√¢t√©-sur-p√¢t√© until the outbreak of the Second World War, when the production of decorated ceramics was severely curtailed. After the Second World War, business improved at Minton and the firm considered resuming production of p√¢te-sur-p√¢te, for which there was still some demand. However, with the passing away of Solon's apprentices, the scarcity of suitable artists posed a problem. It was not until 1992 that Minton used the technique once more in order to mark the firm's bicentenary. The result was a small number of vases, produced to some degree of success, these later vases being reproductions of earlier pieces by Alboin Birks, a gifted apprentice of Solon, who used moulds to speed production and combat costs. Although tableware continues to be produced under the Minton brand-name, there is no longer a Minton factory. The Victorian buildings were replaced in the 1950s and these were in turn demolished when much pottery production moved overseas at the end of the twentieth century. American production The French potter Taxile Doat was responsible for some production in the US at University City, Missouri in the early twentieth century. He was recruited by Edward Gardner Lewis for an Art Academy and Porcelain Works which was part of the People's University.

Historically, it was foreshadowed by the work of Schwinger and proposed almost simultaneously by Keldysh and, separately, Kadanoff and Baym. It was further developed by later contributors such as O. V. Konstantinov and V. I. Perel. Extension to driven-dissipative open quantum systems is given in The Keldysh formalism provides a systematic way to study non-equilibrium systems, usually based on the two-point functions corresponding to excitations in the system. The main mathematical object in the Keldysh formalism is the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF), which is a two-point function of particle fields. In this way, it resembles the Matsubara formalism, which is based on equilibrium Green functions in imaginary-time and treats only equilibrium systems.  Time evolution of a quantum system  Consider a general quantum mechanical system. This system has the Hamiltonian H_0. Let the initial state of the system be n \\\\rangle, which can either be a pure state or a mixed state. If we now add a time- dependent perturbation to this Hamiltonian, say H'(t), the full Hamiltonian is H(t) = H_0+H'(t) and hence the system will evolve in time under the full Hamiltonian. In this section, we will see how time evolution actually works in quantum mechanics. Consider a Hermitian operator \\\\mathcal{O}. In the Heisenberg Picture of quantum mechanics, this operator is time-dependent and the state is not. The expectation value of the operator \\\\mathcal{O}(t) is given by \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{O}(t) \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle n  {U}^{\\\\dagger}(t,0) \\\\, \\\\mathcal{O}(0) \\\\, U(t,0)  n \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} Where, due to time evolution of operators in the Heisenberg Picture, \\\\mathcal{O}(t) = U^{\\\\dagger}(t,0) \\\\mathcal{O}(0) U(t, 0). The time-evolution unitary operator U(t_2, t_1)is the time-ordered exponential of an integral U(t_2,t_1)=T(e^{-i\\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} H(t') dt'}) (Note that if the Hamiltonian at one time commutes with the Hamiltonian at different times, then this can be simplified to U(t_2,t_1)=e^{-i\\\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} H(t') dt'}) For perturbative quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is often more convenient to use the interaction picture. The interaction picture operator is \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{O_I}(t) &= {U_0}^{\\\\dagger}(t,0) \\\\, \\\\mathcal{O}(0) \\\\, U_0(t,0) \\\\end{align} Where U_0(t_1,t_2) = e^{-iH_0(t_1-t_2)} . Then defining S(t_1,t_2) = U_0^{\\\\dagger}(t_1,t_2)U(t_1, t_2) we have \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{O}(t) \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle n  {S}^{\\\\dagger}(t,0) \\\\mathcal{O_I}(t) S(t,0)  n \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} Since the time-evolution unitary operators satisfy U(t_3, t_2) U(t_2, t_1) = U(t_3, t_1), the above expression can be rewritten as \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{O}(t) \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle n  {S}^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\infty,0) S(\\\\infty, t) \\\\mathcal{O_I}(t) \\\\, S(t,0)  n \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} or with \\\\infty replaced by any time value greater than t.  Path ordering on the Keldysh contour  We can write the above expression more succinctly by, purely formally, replacing each operator X(t) with a contour- ordered operator X(c) , such that c parametrizes the contour path on the time axis starting at t=0, proceeding to t=\\\\infty, and then returning to t=0. This path is known as the Keldysh contour. X(c) has the same operator action as X(t) (where t is the time value corresponding to c) but also has the additional information of c (that is, strictly speaking X(c_1) eq X(c_2) if c_1 eq c_2 , even if for the corresponding times X(t_1) = X(t_2) ). Then we can introduce notation of path ordering on this contour, by defining \\\\mathcal{T_c} ( X^{(1)}(c_1) X^{(2)}(c_2)\\\\ldots X^{(n)}(c_n) ) = (\\\\pm 1)^{\\\\sigma}X^{(\\\\sigma(1))}(c_{\\\\sigma(1)}) X^{(\\\\sigma(2))}(c_{\\\\sigma(2)})\\\\ldots X^{(\\\\sigma(n))}(c_{\\\\sigma(n)}) , where \\\\sigma is a permutation such that c_{\\\\sigma(1)} < c_{\\\\sigma(2)} < \\\\ldots c_{\\\\sigma(n)} , and the plus and minus signs are for bosonic and fermionic operators respectively. Note that this is a generalization of time ordering. With this notation, the above time evolution is written as \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{O}(t) \\\\rangle &= \\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c}( \\\\mathcal{O(c)} e^{-i\\\\int dc' H'(c')})  n \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} Where c corresponds to the time t on the forward branch of the Keldysh contour, and the integral over c' goes over the entire Keldysh contour. For the rest of this article, as is conventional, we will usually simply use the notation X(t) for X(c) where t is the time corresponding to c, and whether c is on the forward or reverse branch is inferred from context.  Keldysh diagrammatic technique for Green's functions  The non-equilibrium Green's function is defined as \\\\begin{align} iG(x_1, t_1, x_2, t_2)= \\\\langle n  T \\\\psi(x_1,t_1) \\\\psi(x_2,t_2)  n \\\\rangle \\\\end{align}. Or in the interaction picture \\\\begin{align} iG(x_1, t_1, x_2, t_2)= \\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c} (e^{-i\\\\int_c H'(t')dt'} \\\\psi(x_1,t_1) \\\\psi(x_2,t_2))  n \\\\rangle \\\\end{align} . We can expand the exponential as a Taylor series to obtain the perturbation series \\\\sum_{j=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c} ((-i\\\\int_t (H'(t', +)+ H'(t',-) )dt')^j \\\\psi(x_1,t_1) \\\\psi(x_2,t_2))  n \\\\rangle / j! . This is the same procedure as in equilibrium diagrammatic perturbation theory, but with the important difference that both forward and reverse contour branches are included. If, as is often the case, H' is a polynomial or series as a function of the elementary fields \\\\psi, we can organize this perturbation series into monomial terms and apply all possible Wick pairings to the fields in each monomial, obtaining a summation of Feynman diagrams. However, the edges of the Feynman diagram correspond to different propagators depending on whether the paired operators come from the forward or reverse branches. Namely, : \\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c} \\\\psi (x_1, t_1, +) \\\\psi (x_2, t_2, +)n \\\\rangle \\\\equiv G_0^{++}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\\\langle n\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\psi (x_1,t_1) \\\\psi (x_2,t_2)n \\\\rangle : \\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c} \\\\psi (x_1, t_1, +) \\\\psi (x_2, t_2, -)n \\\\rangle \\\\equiv G_0^{+-}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\\\langle n\\\\psi (x_1,t_1) \\\\psi (x_2,t_2)n \\\\rangle : \\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c} \\\\psi (x_1, t_1, -) \\\\psi (x_2, t_2, +)n \\\\rangle \\\\equiv G_0^{-+}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\\\pm \\\\langle n \\\\psi (x_2,t_2)\\\\psi (x_1,t_1)n \\\\rangle : \\\\langle n  \\\\mathcal{T_c} \\\\psi (x_1, t_1, -) \\\\psi (x_2, t_2, -)n \\\\rangle \\\\equiv G_0^{--}(x_1,t_1 , x_2, t_2)= \\\\langle n\\\\mathcal{\\\\overline{T}}\\\\psi (x_1,t_1) \\\\psi (x_2,t_2)n \\\\rangle where the anti-time ordering \\\\mathcal{\\\\overline{T}} orders operators in the opposite way as time ordering and the \\\\pm sign in G_0^{-+} is for bosonic or fermionic fields. Note that G_0^{--} is the propagator used in ordinary ground state theory. Thus, Feynman diagrams for correlation functions can be drawn and their values computed the same way as in ground state theory, except with the following modifications to the Feynman rules: Each internal vertex of the diagram is labeled with either \\\\+ or \\\\- , while external vertices are labelled with -. Then each (unrenormalized) edge directed from a vertex a (with position x_a, time t_a and sign s_a) to a vertex b (with position x_b, time t_b and sign s_b) corresponds to the propagator G_0^{s_as_b}(x_a,t_a , x_b, t_b). Then the diagram values for each choice of \\\\pm signs (there are 2^{v} such choices, where v is the number of internal vertices) are all added up to find the total value of the diagram.

On 31 June 1408 he was therefore replaced as patriarch by Antonio di Ponte, but, with the support of some cardinals who opposed Gregory, he obtained his reinstatement at the Council of Basel. In 1411 he was elected cardinal by John XXIII in order to free the Aquileian throne to Louis of Teck, a nobleman whose German allegiances were useful for the antipope. Pancieri remained in Friuli, but in 1412 he was forced to flee. In 1414 he took part in the Council of Constance, being among the accusators of Gregory XII. In 1417 he participated in the election of Pope Martin V, who made him administrator of Satriano and then of Frascati (1420). Later Panciera became abbot of Concordia, but never moved there. He died in 1431 and was buried in the Vatican grottoes under St. Peter's Basilica.

The VV were used to assist militsiya in policing, deal with riots and internal armed conflicts, and safeguard important facilities such as nuclear power plants. In wartime, the Internal Troops were under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian armed forces for local defense and rear area security. The Internal Troops had similar personnel, bases, equipment, and traditions as the Soviet Internal Troops. Soviet VV units in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic during the dissolution of the Soviet Union were moved to the jurisdiction of newly independent Ukraine. However, Ukrainian VV troops were not a direct successor of the Soviet Internal Troops (unlike the Internal Troops of Russia) and their structure and tasks had been reformed. As of 2008, the Internal Troops of Ukraine numbered about 33,000. They were involved in the 2013 Euromaidan revolution, defending the Presidential Administration Building in Kyiv. Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine issued a decree on 13 March 2014 which transferred the powers of the Internal Troops to the restored National Guard of Ukraine.https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&langpair;=uk%7Cen&rurl;=translate.google.com&sandbox;=0&u;=http://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/877-18&usg;=ALkJrhim-0eJ5eLvBLzD2zGSUyMATxjTWg  History  = National Guard and Internal Troops = The Internal Troops of Ukraine were formed on January 5, 1992 as part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs as the chief security directorate, and enacted by the Verkhovna Rada on March 26. Before that, all Soviet Internal Troops based in Ukraine were reorganized into the National Guard of Ukraine (initially as the Republican Guard) by a January 24, 1991 decree of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada. The troops later returned to their former tasks (and name), and the National Guard was disbanded. = Internal security during election unrest = The Orange Revolution was a series of peaceful protests which overturned a presidential election during the winter of 2004‚Äì2005, resulting in the election of Viktor Yushchenko. On November 28, 2004 over 10,000 Internal Troops mobilized to suppress protests on Independence Square in Kyiv by orders of their commander, Lt. Gen. Sergei Popkov. The SBU warned opposition leaders about the crackdown. Oleksandr Galaka, head of the GUR, made calls to \\"prevent bloodshed\\". SBU chief Col. Gen. Ihor P. Smesko and military counterintelligence chief Maj. Gen. Vitaly Romanchenko warned Popkov to pull back his troops, and he complied. SBU senior officers claimed credit for averting a situation they said risked bloodshed and, possibly, civil war. = Reorganization attempts = After a decade within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Internal Troops were reorganized. In May 2007, an ongoing political crisis led to a jurisdictional dispute over the troops. President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree moving the Internal Troops from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the jurisdiction of the President. On May 25, the Internal Troops loyal to the president marched to Kyiv. The Ministry of Internal Affairs criticized the decree and the troop movements. Both sides avoided further clashes. The Internal Troops returned to their routine tasks, re-establishing coordination with the police, but the legal dispute over the troops remained unsolved. The Troops command was loyal to the president, in accordance with the decree appealed in court by the Cabinet of Ministers. Berkut special police and conscripted Internal Troops Organization Although they reported to a civilian militsiya, the Internal Troops of Ukraine were a paramilitary force with a centralized system of ranks and service. The chief commander and staff of the Troops maintain a separate chain of command, and VV battalions and regiments were under the command of six territorial commanders (who report to the chief commander). The VV units were stationed on military bases throughout the country, including central Kyiv. The Internal Troops had an aviation brigade, initially formed from the 51st Separate Helicopter Guard Regiment (Oleksandriia, Kirovohrad Oblast) and the 31st Special Helicopter Battle Squadron (Bila Tserkva). In 2000 the 51st Separate Helicopter Brigade was reinforced by an aviation squadron from the Yaguar special-operations unit, obtaining an additional airfield in Kalynivka, Vinnytsia Oblast. =Territorial divisions= There were six territorial commands (UK:–¢–µ—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–º –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è–º, abbreviated TpK (EN:Trk): West, North, East, Center, South, and Crimea.

All were named for felidae: Bars (Snow Leopard, near Kyiv), Yahuar (Jaguar in Vinnytsia Oblast), and Hepard (Cheetah in Zaporizhia). On May 19, 2004, the 37th Separate Battalion of Internal Troops moved from Pavlohrad to Crimea, becoming the 47th Special-Assignment Regiment (later Tyhr, Tiger). The Bars brigade, part of the Kyiv territorial command, includes a special-assignment Omega battalion (an anti-terrorist sniper unit). The Tyhr regiment is part of the Crimea territorial command; Yahuar and Hepard were company-sized regiments under the Chief Directorate of Internal Troops. =Other units= Patch of Kobra Kobra (Cobra) is a mountain-rifle special-ops battalion headquartered in Balaklava. Its present status is unclear. Skorpion, an anti-terrorist unit that maintains the security of nuclear facilities such as the Chernobyl AES, was originally part of the National Guard of Ukraine. The 290th (Novorossiysk) Regiment was formed in April 1942 as part of the Soviet Internal Troops' mechanized infantry. During World War II, it defended the Georgian Military Road, participated in the liberation of Novorossiysk and maintained order in areas liberated from Nazi occupation. On November 24, 1945 the regiment was relocated to Kyiv, where until 1947 it fought gang violence in western Ukraine. In 1970 the regiment maintained order in Odessa during a cholera epidemic, and participated in security during the 1980 Summer Olympics. In 1985, it maintained order at the Moscow World Youth Forum. From April 26, 1986, to May 1987 the regiment served in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, maintaining order and preventing looting. From 1988 to 1991, it conducted a peacekeeping mission in the Caucasus. In 1992, the regiment joined the National Guard of Ukraine. After the disbanding of the National Guard in 2000, in accordance with a presidential decree it was transferred to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Tasks Police officer attacked by protesters during clashes in Kyiv, February 18, 2014 The Internal Troops assist the militsiya in policing, crowd control, anti-riot operations, defending major facilities, guarding diplomatic missions, combating internal armed disturbances and terrorism (including some special forces tasks) and maintaining order during a state of emergency. Personnel The Internal Troops had gradually changed from the Soviet conscript system (similar to that for the Soviet Army) to the contract-personnel system. Conscription was ended by President Viktor Yanukovych in October 2013. VV officers were trained at the Internal Troops Academy.

JƒÅnis Balodis father was historian and teacher VoldemƒÅrs Balodis. In 1898 he joined the Imperial Russian Army and served in Kaunas. From 1900 until 1902 he studied at the Vilnius War School. From November 1904 until July 1905 he participated in the Russo‚ÄìJapanese War and was seriously wounded in the arm. From 1906 until 1914 Balodis served in Vilnius. At the beginning of World War I he was lightly wounded during the battles in East Prussia, for which he received a number of decorations. On 20 February 1915, while recuperating in hospital, he was captured by the German Army and spent the rest of the war in a POW camp in Silesia. Balodis returned to Latvia immediately after the end of World War I in November 1918, and joined the first armed units of the newly established Republic of Latvia on 18 December 1918. When Riga was threatened by the advancing Red Army, Balodis retreated from Riga together with the army and the government on 3 January 1919. On 26 February 1919 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant colonel. After the death of Oskars Kalpaks on 6 March 1919 he was further promoted to the rank of Colonel and took control of the few Latvian soldiers in Courland. During the spring of 1919, after a string of victories over the Red Army, Balodis was given command over larger units and eventually over the Southern Group of the armed forces. In this role he was forced into an uneasy alliance with German troops. [citation for ‚Äùforced‚Äù and ‚Äúuneasy‚Äù?] In the second half of 1919 Balodis led the 1st Courland division in battles against the Red Army in Latgale. During the panic that followed the sudden attack of West Russian Volunteer Army (Bermontians), Balodis was appointed the Commander-in-Chief on 16 October 1919. After the victory over the Bermontians, Balodis was promoted to General on 23 January 1920. After the conclusion of the Latvian War of Independence, the post of Commander-in-Chief was abolished in February 1921 and in July of the same year Balodis asked to be discharged from the army. By a special law of the Saeima he was presented with 100 hectares of land and a manor house. He joined the Latvian Farmers Union, the largest party at the time which was led by KƒÅrlis Ulmanis. Balodis was elected to the Saeima in 1925, but played only a secondary role in politics. On 7 December 1931 he became Minister of War, a post he held until 5 April 1940. Beginning in July 1933 Balodis held frequent talks with KƒÅrlis Ulmanis about the need for the end of the multi-party system in Latvia. As Minister of War he played a crucial role in organizing the Latvian coup d'√©tat on 15 May 1934, and together with Prime Minister KƒÅrlis Ulmanis was one of two signatories of the proclamation by which martial law was declared and the Saeima dissolved. During the following years of authoritarian, corporatist rule, Balodis could always be found next to Ulmanis, creating a perception of duumvirate, while in reality his role was limited to the military matters. On 12 March 1936 he became Vice President, and on 11 February 1938 Deputy Prime Minister. After the signing of the Soviet‚ÄìLatvian Mutual Assistance Treaty on 5 October 1939, Latvia became a virtual protectorate of the Soviet Union without a shot being fired. Tensions within the ruling circles increased to the point where on 5 April 1940 Balodis was relieved of all his posts without a clear official explanation. Shortly after the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 Balodis was arrested on 31 July 1940 together with his wife and deported to Syzran, where they were kept under house arrest. After the start of German‚ÄìSoviet war in 1941 they were deported to Kuibishev. Only in 1952, he was formally tried and sentenced to a prison sentence of 25 years to be served in a jail in Vladimir. With the beginning of the de-Stalinization in 1956 he was released and allowed to return to Latvia. He and his wife received a small apartment in Riga and spent some time living in a summer house in Saulkrasti. In early August 1965 his health failed and he died on 8 August. General Balodis was buried in Riga. His widow managed to install a tombstone with a sword and the inscription \\"General Balodis\\" which was removed by KGB.

It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and all but the thinnest branches, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, yellowish green flowers and cup-shaped to cylindrical fruit.flowers and budsfruit Description Eucalyptus grossa is a mallee, rarely a straggly tree or sometimes a shrub, that grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, grey to brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have more or less egg-shaped leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, glossy green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a thick, downturned, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on thick pedicels up to long. Mature buds are long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs mainly from August to November and the flowers are yellowish green. The fuit is a woody, cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves at or below rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus grossa was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham in Flora Australiensis from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. The type collection was made by George Maxwell near the Phillips River and its tributaries. The specific epithet (grossa) is from the Latin grossus, meaning 'thick' or 'coarse', referring to the leaves, buds and fruit. Distribution and habitat Coarse-leaved mallee grows around granite rocks and in thickets on flat and slightly undulating ground from near Newdegate to the south and east of Norseman in the Coolgardie, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by botanist George Bentham in 1867. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses =Use in horticulture= This species has ornamental flowers and can be maintained as a dense, compact shrub if regular pruning is undertaken. It has proved adaptable to a wide range of conditions in temperate areas in Australia. =Cultural references= The coarse-leaved mallee appeared on a 50 cent Australian postage stamp in 2005.

He was the biologist on Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917, and served as the director of the Scottish Home Department Marine Laboratory, at Torry, Aberdeen. Early life Robert Clark was born on 11 September 1882 in Aberdeen, the son of William Clark. He attended Aberdeen Grammar School and then Aberdeen University from where he graduated with an M.A. in 1908. In 1911 he attained a B.Sc. and became Zoologist to the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, Edinburgh, a post he held until he was appointed naturalist to the Marine Biological Association in 1913. While at the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory, he worked on some of the Antarctic specimens that William Speirs Bruce had brought back from the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902‚Äì04. He was a natural sportsman, a keen golfer and angler, and was selected to play cricket for Scotland in 1912. He had a reserved manner, not given to laughing or joking, but with a strong work ethic and a passion for biology. Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition On 9 August 1914 the Endurance departed Plymouth, carrying Shackleton and his crew on what was intended to be the first expedition to cross Antarctica from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the South Pole. Over 5000 applications for places in the crew had been received. The expedition was a failure: the ship became trapped in pack ice and was eventually destroyed by the pressure of the ice, but all the crew of the Endurance were eventually rescued after Shackleton and five men made an 800-mile sea journey to fetch help. Clark was a hard worker, and, despite his dour manner, quickly won the respect of the crew with his willingness to volunteer for some of the more arduous or unpleasant jobs aboard ship, although he was the butt of several jokes. He was not the politest of men, and a little verse was composed around his apparent inability to remember to say \\"please\\". The crew boiled some spaghetti and placed it in one of his collecting jars, causing him momentary excitement at the thought of having discovered a new species, and a standing joke claimed the penguins seen alongside were said to shout out \\"Clark, Clark\\" and chase after the ship whenever he was at the wheel. He worked arduously at his biological recording from the moment the expeditions set out, recording the specimens encountered using dredging nets as the ship progressed southwards. When the ship became trapped in the ice he continued with his work, dissecting penguins and recording the changes in the plankton levels in sea. When the ship had to be abandoned all Clark's specimens were left behind. Frank Worsley recorded: Once they reached the edge of the pack ice the crew set out for Elephant Island in three of the small boats of the Endurance. Clark travelled in the 22¬Ω-foot James Caird with Shackleton, Frank Hurley, Leonard Hussey, Reginald James, James Wordie, Harry McNish, Charles Green, John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On arriving at the island, Shackleton set out almost immediately with five of the crew to fetch rescue from South Georgia. The rest of the men, Clark among them, stayed camped on the island with Frank Wild in command. Elephant Island was inhospitable. It was cold but humid which meant that neither the clothing nor the sleeping bags were ever completely dry. Though there were penguins and seals to eat, the supplies were not inexhaustible and fuel was scarce. The routine on the island was monotonous. Clark managed to produce a primitive alcoholic beverage from methylated spirit, sugar, water and ginger which became known as \\"Gut Rot 1916\\" and was drunk with a toast to \\"Wives and Sweethearts\\" on Saturdays. On 30 August 1916, the men on Elephant Island were rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship Yelcho, four months after he had left the island. After the expedition Clark returned to Scotland where he married Christine Ferguson. He served as a Lieutenant on minesweepers in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during World War I and then returned to Plymouth in 1919 when the war finished. His cricketing skills led to his again being selected for Scotland in 1924. In 1925 he gained a D.Sc. (Doctor of Science), and in the same year he became the director of the Fisheries Research Laboratory in Torry, Aberdeen. In 1934, he was appointed Superintendent of Scientific Investigations under the Fishery Board for Scotland. He contributed papers on herring larvae and haddock stocks. In 1935 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, Sir John Graham Kerr and James Hartley Ashworth.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He retired in 1948 and died two years later at home in Murtle, Aberdeenshire. He had no children.

Etymology The palace gets its name from the 122 horses that are carved into the wooden wall brackets that support the southern roof. The official name of the palace is Puthen Malika (New Mansion). The palace forms part of a vast complex of royal buildings in the vicinity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The building was left unoccupied for more than a century, following the demise of Swathi Thirunal in 1846. Architecture A view of the 'horses' at Kuthiramalika Built in the 1840s, Kuthiramalika is an example of traditional Kerala architecture, with its typical sloping roofs, overhanging eaves, pillared verandahs and enclosed courtyards. Intricate carvings adorn the wooden ceilings, with each room having a distinctive pattern. The construction of the palace was completed by 5000 Vishwabrahmins (‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥∂‡µç‡¥µ‡¥ï‡µº‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥Æ‡¥ú‡µº) in four years. The palace is made from teakwood, rosewood, marble, and granite. The roof of the palace is made of wood and 42 beams support the carved patterns. The roof is supported by granite pillars. Floral motifs dot the ceiling of the verandah. The main 16 rooms of the palace are constructed in 16 different patterns. In all, the palace contains 80 rooms, of which 20 were opened for visitors in 1995. The floor inside the palace is made of egg whites, charcoal, and limestone, which make it cold and smooth even in hot weather conditions. The concert venue built in the palace premises uses traditional sound reflectors comprising fifty clay pots hung upside down from the ceiling. Museum A portion of Kuthiramalika has been converted to a Palace Museum that houses some of the assets owned by the Travancore Royal Family. Although 80 rooms are there in the palace, only 20 are open for visitors. A guided tour is available inside the palace. The palace collections include 14 life-size Kathakali mannequins, Belgian and Italian mirrors, crystal chandeliers, paintings, a giant Belgian harpoon, armaments, musical instruments, traditional furniture, greek statues, a musical tree which produces 8 sounds on tapping, and other artifacts. On the right side of the mannequins are the ivory cradles of various sizes. The palace has on display two royal thrones, one made from 24 elephant tusks (Dantasimhasana) and the other of Bohemian crystal with the Tranvancore emblem 'conch' adorning the top of the backrest. The palace has a large collection of idols and sculptures made from white marble. On the first floor are rooms that once served as the audience chamber, the library and an alcove that Swathi Thirunal used for meditating and for conceiving many of his famous musical compositions. This place offers a direct view of the Padmanabhaswamy temple gopuram. The small wooden stair there contains carvings of peacock, elephant, and dragon. Ceiling of the rooms contain paintings of parrot, peacock, and elephant. One of the rooms displays an illusion portrait of Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, painted by Svetoslav Roerich. The face and the shoes of the king appear facing the onlooker from every corner of the room. Swathi Sangeethotsavam The courtyard of Kuthiramalika is the venue for Swathi Sangeethotsavam (also known as Kuthiramalika Festival), a yearly music festival commemorating the legacy of Swathi Thirunal. This music festival is conducted from 6 to 12 January every year. It attracts many of the leading stalwarts of Carnatic and Hindustani classical music. Some of the famous performers of the past include Bismillah Khan, Kishori Amonkar, M. Balamuralikrishna, D. K. Pattammal, and Gangubai Hangal. In films The Kuthiramalika palace has been visualized in many Malayalam films. It was also mentioned in the famous TV show The Big Bang Theory in Season 11 Episode 03; The Relaxation Integration.

Pratt contracted polio at the age of 4 and later developed osteomyelitis, an inflammatory disease of the bone. This affected her for most of her life. She received degrees in English and Philosophy from Victoria College, University of Toronto, with a gold medal. She then studied international relations at Columbia University, and art at the Boston Museum of Fine Art among other schools. She went on to become an editor for Macmillan Canada, the University of Toronto Press, and Harvard University Press, and senior editor at McClelland & Stewart from 1956-1965. She retired due to her health issues in 1964, although continued to freelance for various publishing houses. She continued her art studies in Toronto and Massachusetts. She published Silent Ancestors in 1971. This genealogical essay is a tribute to the descendants of the Pratt family, originally from Yorkshire, who settled in Newfoundland. Pratt's art consisted largely of woodcuts, and there were exhibitions of her graphic art across North America and in Europe. Her interest in Japanese graphics stimulated an interest in haiku. Her work in this style was widely published, often with her own illustrations. Her work was also inspired by her father's poetry, and she use excerpts from his poems in many of her Christmas cards. She also explored the themes and imagery of E. J. Pratt's work in various works.

Tyk2 was the first member of the JAK family that was described (the other members are JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3). It has been implicated in IFN-Œ±, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 signaling.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the tyrosine kinase and, to be more specific, the Janus kinases (JAKs) protein families. This protein associates with the cytoplasmic domain of type I and type II cytokine receptors and promulgate cytokine signals by phosphorylating receptor subunits. It is also component of both the type I and type III interferon signaling pathways. As such, it may play a role in anti- viral immunity. Cytokines play pivotal roles in immunity and inflammation by regulating the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and function of immune cells, as well as cells from other organ systems. Hence, targeting cytokines and their receptors is an effective means of treating such disorders. Type I and II cytokine receptors associate with Janus family kinases (JAKs) to affect intracellular signaling. Cytokines including interleukins, interferons and hemopoietins activate the Janus kinases, which associate with their cognate receptors. The mammalian JAK family has four members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). The connection between Jaks and cytokine signaling was first revealed when a screen for genes involved in interferon type I (IFN-1) signaling identified Tyk2 as an essential element, which is activated by an array of cytokine receptors. Tyk2 has broader and profound functions in humans than previously appreciated on the basis of analysis of murine models, which indicate that Tyk2 functions primarily in IL-12 and type I-IFN signaling. Tyk2 deficiency has more dramatic effects in human cells than in mouse cells. However, in addition to IFN-Œ± and -Œ≤ and IL-12 signaling, Tyk2 has major effects on the transduction of IL-23, IL-10, and IL-6 signals. Since, IL-6 signals through the gp-130 receptor-chain that is common to a large family of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-11, IL-27, IL-31, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor, cardiotrophin 1, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and LIF, Tyk2 might also affect signaling through these cytokines. Recently, it has been recognized that IL-12 and IL-23 share ligand and receptor subunits that activate Tyk2. IL-10 is a critical anti- inflammatory cytokine, and IL-10‚àí/‚àí mice suffer from fatal, systemic autoimmune disease. Tyk2 is activated by IL-10, and its deficiency affects the ability to generate and respond to IL-10. Under physiological conditions, immune cells are, in general, regulated by the action of many cytokines and it has become clear that cross-talk between different cytokine-signalling pathways is involved in the regulation of the JAK‚ÄìSTAT pathway.  Role in inflammation  It is now widely accepted that atherosclerosis is a result of cellular and molecular events characteristic of inflammation. Vascular inflammation can be caused by upregulation of Ang-II, which is produced locally by inflamed vessels and induces synthesis and secretion of IL-6, a cytokine responsible for induction of angiotensinogen synthesis in liver through JAK/STAT3 pathway, which gets activated through high affinity membrane protein receptors on target cells, termed IL-6R-chain recruiting gp-130 that is associated with tyrosine kinases (Jaks 1/2, and Tyk2 kinase). Cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 gets elevated in lungs of chronically suffered asthmatics. Signalling through IL-4/IL-13 complexes is thought to occur through IL-4RŒ±- chain, which is responsible for activation of JAK-1 and Tyk2 kinases. A role of Tyk2 in rheumatoid arthritis is directly observed in Tyk2-deficient mice that were resistant to experimental arthritis. Tyk2‚àí/‚àí mice displayed a lack of responsiveness to a small amount of IFN-Œ±, but they respond normally to a high concentration of IFN-Œ±/Œ≤. In addition, these mice respond normally to IL-6 and IL-10, suggesting that Tyk2 is dispensable for mediating for IL-6 and IL-10 signaling and does not play a major role in IFN-Œ± signaling. Although Tyk2‚àí/‚àí mice are phenotypically normal, they exhibit abnormal responses to inflammatory challenges in a variety of cells isolated from Tyk2‚àí/‚àí mice. The most remarkable phenotype observed in Tyk2-deficient macrophages was lack of nitric oxide production upon stimulation with LPS. Further elucidation of molecular mechanisms of LPS signaling, showed that Tyk2 and IFN-Œ≤ deficiency leads resistance to LPS-induced endotoxin shock, whereas STAT1-deficient mice are susceptible. Development of a Tyk2 inhibitor appears to be a rational approach in the drug discovery.  Clinical significance  A mutation in this gene has been associated with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) - a primary immunodeficiency characterized by elevated serum immunoglobulin E. Interactions Tyrosine kinase 2 has been shown to interact with FYN, PTPN6, IFNAR1, Ku80 and GNB2L1.

It is a member of the Janus kinase family and has been implicated in signaling by members of the type II cytokine receptor family (e.g. interferon receptors), the GM-CSF receptor family (IL-3R, IL-5R and GM-CSF-R), the gp130 receptor family (e.g., IL-6R), and the single chain receptors (e.g. Epo-R, Tpo-R, GH-R, PRL-R). The distinguishing feature between janus kinase 2 and other JAK kinases is the lack of Src homology binding domains (SH2/SH3) and the presence of up to seven JAK homology domains (JH1-JH7). Nonetheless the terminal JH domains retain a high level of homology to tyrosine kinase domains. An interesting note is that only one of these carboxy-terminal JH domains retains full kinase function (JH1) while the other (JH2), previously thought to have no kinase functionality and accordingly termed a pseudokinase domain, has since been found to be catalytically active, albeit at only 10% that of the JH1 domain. Loss of Jak2 is lethal by embryonic day 12 in mice. JAK2 orthologs have been identified in all mammals for which complete genome data are available.  Clinical significance  JAK2 gene fusions with the TEL(ETV6) (TEL-JAK2) and PCM1 genes have been found in patients suffering leukemia, particularly clonal eosinophilia forms of the disease. Mutations in JAK2 have been implicated in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis as well as other myeloproliferative disorders. This mutation (V617F), a change of valine to phenylalanine at the 617 position, appears to render hematopoietic cells more sensitive to growth factors such as erythropoietin and thrombopoietin, because the receptors for these growth factors require JAK2 for signal transduction. An inhibitor of JAK2-STAT5, AZD1480, was pointed as having activity in primary and CRPC. Jak2 mutation, when demonstrable, is one of the methods of diagnosing polycythemia vera.

Originally established as a choral foundation to train choir boys for the affiliated Llandaff Cathedral, it is now part of the Woodard Schools foundation and continues to provide choristers for the cathedral. It is the only surviving Anglican choir school in Wales and is a member of the ISC, IAPS and the Choir Schools Association.http://www.choirschools.org.uk/ It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of leading independent schools.  History  The school chapel The Lodge, which houses Nursery and Infant pupils. = Buildings and Expansion = The original part of the School House was the old house of the Bishop of Llandaff before becoming a school. It is by far the oldest part of the school, and remains a Grade II listed building. The School Chapel was built in 1859 attached to the original School House building. It is dedicated to St. Nicholas (the patron saint of children) and St. Mary (the embodiment of parenting). The School House has had the addition of a refectory, library and IT suites over the years, as well as the addition of a staff room. The Jubilee Building, Sports Hall, Gloucester Building, Pavilion, The Lodge, Sixth Form Centre, Woodard Building, and Memorial Hall are all more recent separate additions to the school as its enrolment and age range have expanded. * The Lodge was acquired by the school in the early 2010s, and later renovated, being completed in 2013. This is used as the main building for the nursery and infant pupils. * The Sixth Form Centre was renovated and completed in 2013. The original building was the old Headmaster's House, which had since been vacated. The Sixth Form Centre serves as the main hub for students in Year 12 and 13, and the new building provided more space for study and relaxation. * The newer Woodard Building was completed in 2014. This was built on the site of the old nursery building once nursery pupils had moved to the Lodge. The Woodard Building includes 11 new classrooms: 2 biology laboratories, 3 rooms for languages, and 6 rooms for humanities. * The Memorial Hall was completed in 2017, opened on the site of a previous hall owned by Llandaff Cathedral. This is now used for the daily education of the nursery and infant pupils, and their lunch arrangements. Before the original hall was demolished, there was controversy over a number of local children's play groups being evicted from the new building, with the site being sold by Llandaff Cathedral primarily for financial reasons. = Past Students = While Roald Dahl was a pupil at the school, he was involved in the \\"Great Mouse Plot of 1924\\", which he later described in his autobiography, Boy: Tales of Childhood. This is the first of numerous occasions in which he outlines in great detail the perceived cruelty of corporal punishment in schools. The headmaster at this time was Mr T. R. Coombes. Structure The school divides the academic year into Michaelmas, Lent, and Summer terms. = Sections = The Cathedral School consists of three sections: Infant School (ages 3‚Äì7), Junior School (ages 7‚Äì11) and Senior School (years 7‚Äì13). Sixth form teaching began in September 2013. In the 2012 Estyn inspection, the overarching judgements made by the inspectors were that the school's current performance was Excellent and that the school's prospects for improvement were Excellent. = Size = In 2018, there were 807 pupils and students enrolled at the school. Of these, 33 were in the nursery, 341 were in the infants and juniors, and 466 were in the seniors (of which 115 were in the Sixth Form). There are a maximum of 72 students per year from Years 7 to 11, equally split between the 3 senior Houses. Around 60% of the school's enrollment are boys This gender imbalance can be partially explained by the nearby Howells School Llandaff that is girls-only from Years 7 to 11. Curriculum =Junior School= Modern Language education begins early, generally during Key Stage 2. In the 2005 inspection, pupils were reported to have performed well above the national average in National Curriculum tests. =Senior School= A traditional academic education, with sciences separately taught by specialists, along with a range of modern languages (French, Spanish, German) in addition to Latin, is delivered alongside very competitive sport (senior pupils have an unusually generous amount of time allocated to sport) and opportunities in the Arts. Pupils have generally performed well in the GCSE exams. The school was ranked top co-educational school in Wales in 2012 for GCSE success.The Times, 1 September 2012 Every pupil up to Year 9 receives music tuition for 45 minutes per week in class. Interested pupils may choose to take GCSE Music. 2018 was the first year that Cathedral School pupils sat exams under the reformed English system of GCSEs (on a scale of 9 to 1 rather than A* to G). Although the 2017 cohort had sat English Language and Mathematics under the new system, the 2018 cohort sat nearl all their GCSEs under the new system. Pastoral care = House System = Every pupil in the Junior Section is a member of the of four junior Houses, named after important people in the founding of the school: Vaughans, Wains, Coombes, and Guys. Every pupil in the Senior Section is a member of one of three senior Houses, named after the Llandaff saints: Dyfrig (yellow), Euddogwy (green), and Teilo (red). The pupils in each house are cared for by one of nine house tutors, who in turn are overseen by a housemaster or housemistress. Heads of house, assisted by their assistant head of house and their tutor teams, are responsible for pupils' pastoral care, oversight of their academic progress and personal development,Senior School ‚Äì Pastoral Care as well as participation in House Events. House Events help pupils to use key skills in productive and fun ways, and many competitions are very competitive. Major house events include House Singing (which is well-attended and is often held in RWCMD or the Reardon Smith Theatre), House Sports (arranged seasonally and including Hockey, Netball, Rounders, Rugby, Football, and Cricket) House Photography, Eisteddfod events, and Sports Day. = Student Leadership = Each year at the end of the Lent term, 10 prefects are chosen by the Head to assist with pastoral support and leadership. Positions include Head, Deputy Head, and Head of House, with one person of each gender simultaneously occupying each position. = Religion = The school provides an explicitly Christian education, with all senior students studying Religious Studies at GCSE level. All pupils and students from Year 3 upwards attend weekly 20 minute services in Llandaff Cathedral, with a longer Eucharist at the beginning of each half term. The school Chapel is available for most of the day, and serves as a quiet place for pupils and staff. The school's Chaplain oversees all religious activities in the school, as well as teaching and supporting the pastoral team. Activities =Music= The Cathedral School is well known for its strong musical tradition. The school continues to provide both the Boy and Girl Choristers for Llandaff Cathedral, and as such has very strong choirs. The boy choristers have sung in the Wales Millennium Centre, with Welsh National Opera, Bryn Terfel and Carlo Rizzi. Music is very strong at the Cathedral School, with several pupils at Grade 8 standard. The music department is housed on the lower floor of the Jubilee Building, with a full range of instruments available and specialist teachers of over 20 instruments. There are numerous musical groups, including: * Senior Chamber Choir * Senior Orchestra * Jazz Band * Flute Choir * String Ensemble * Percussion Ensembles =Drama= Drama has thrived only recently in the school but is rapidly expanding. Pupils write their own work for 'gala evenings' and many pupils are on the books of National Youth Theatre. The drama department is housed on the upper floor of the Jubilee Building, where the Roald Dahl Studio serves both as the drama teaching rooms and as a place for presentations and events. The drama department puts on 2 plays every year, one short production in December and a longer summer production in June. Summer productions have included: * HMS Pinafore * Oliver! * Guys and Dolls * Fiddler on the Roof * Joseph * High School Musical * Blood Brothers. =Sport= Over twenty sports are played at the school, with pupils at international level in cricket, badminton, rugby, gymnastics and sailing. Unusual for a choral foundation school, the school also offers scholarships based on athletic ability. All of the senior section take part in 2 lessons of Games a week, choosing from the seasonal sports of: Rugby, Football, and Cricket (for the boys); Hockey, Netball, and Rounders (for the girls); Rowing, Tennis, Climbing and Squash (mixed gender, year-round sports held outside of school).

Plot In a Philippine village outside the island of Luzon, one special boy changes the lives of everyone he meets. Known to all as Magnifico, his nickname is Ikoy, a child of an impoverished family. His father works odd jobs, his elder brother has lost his academic scholarship (Miong), and his mother spends her days caring for both Helen, a young daughter, who suffers from cerebral palsy, and for her husband's aging mother, who lives upstairs in the family home and has a diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Magnifico is a sweet and well-intentioned boy, who is often berated by his father for his stupidity, an unkind assessment for a child who is considerably more clever than anyone gives him credit for. Magnifico's world is filled with a cast of characters in need of his special gifts of hope, of determination, of love. There's the grief-stricken man who mourns for his mother; two feuding shop owners; the crabby old woman who runs the mortuary; his elder brother, who has a crush on a wealthy girl; his little sister, who wants to get out and experience the world, but cannot walk; and even his own ailing grandmother, who worries that the family won't be able to afford a proper burial for her when the time comes. That's a pretty tall order for just one boy. Nonetheless, Magnifico applies himself diligently to the task, concocting a remedy for the mortician's ailments, playing matchmaker for his love struck brother, industriously scheming to provide a burial gown and coffin for his grandmother, and negotiating a wheelchair so he can take his invalid sister to the carnival. Seeking nothing for himself, with his undaunted dedication to bring joy to the people he loves, Magnifico somehow manages to find just the right solution to fill every need. And when the night of the big carnival arrives, his efforts pay off in spades. Magnifico attempts to cross the street and instead gets fatally hit by a car one afternoon. Gerry, Edna, and Lola Magda mourn for their loss, and their rested in the coffin he has originally crafted and intended for his grandmother. At his interment, Magnifico's family, friends, and the people he has touched were present as the community share a tearful moment for his undying generosity.

Beside being the \\"composer-in-residence\\" of the Ensemble Intermodulation, his works are performed all over Europe: the Hungarian Radio commissioned Irrlichtspiel, for violin and ensemble (a \\"pocket\\" concerto) in 1991. Then the Componensemble premiered Winterszenen (a work based on Schubert‚Äôs Winterreise). In 1992, Summer Music was dedicated to and premiered by the Ensemble Contrechamps in 1992, one of the as yet most performed chamber setting by Tihanyi. In 1994 L‚Äô√âpitaph du Soldat (a short sequel to Stravinsky's A Soldier's Tale) was commissioned by Radio France, and Serenata for four instruments by Rainbow over Bath in 1996. Schattenspiel was composed for members of the Forr√°s Chamber Music Workshop in 1997, and premiered in its original, four-movement version in the same year in Vienna. In 1998, two Swiss foundations, Pro Helvetia and the Zuger Kulturstiftung Landis & Gyr commissioned Matrix for four hands. Atte was premiered in 1999 in Berlin by the UMZE Ensemble. The soloists were Csaba Kleny√°n (clarinet) and Gy√∂rgy D√©ri (cello). In 2002, Musikfabrik premiered Kosmos, and a number of further commissions followed, one of which was the 20 Night Meditations for 8 soloists and orchestra with double strings, that had its western hemisphere premiere in February 2007 at The Juilliard School, New York.

He was born in Tsuruoka, Yamagata Prefecture. A graduate of Sophia University, where he obtained his Master‚Äôs degree, he completed his doctorate at University of M√ºnster in 1958. Two volumes of autobiography on his years in Germany narrate his varied experiences during this period.Watanabe Sh≈çichi,Doitsu ry≈´gakki, K≈çdansha Gendai Shinsho, Tokyo 1980, 2 vols. Returning to his alma mater, he became successively lecturer, assistant professor and full professor, until his retirement. He served as emeritus professor at the same university until his death. A passionate book-collector, he was chairman of the Japan Bibliophile Society. His personal collection of books on English philology (see Bibliography) was perhaps his most important contribution to the field of English philology in Japan, containing many rare items.  Historical revisionism  A conservative opinion-leader affiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi,Watanabe also contributed to the lobby's publication (e.g. September 2012 edition: nipponkaigi.org/publication/details?id=202 Watanabe was known for his dismissal of the Nanking Massacre as a historical delusion, attributing the known killings to the standard revenge of regular soldiers in war against guerrilla combatants whom they have captured.Watanabe Sh≈çichi, Nihonshi kara mita nihonjin ‚Äì Sh≈çwa hen As he later clarified, in his view, the concept of massacre in war should properly be reserved for atrocities against a civilian population, where the numbers roughly exceed the range of 40‚Äì50 victims, as opposed to the wholesale killing of irregular insurgents.\\"Ê∞∏‰πÖ‰øùÂ≠òÁâà - ‰∏âÊ¥æÂêàÂêå Â§ß„Ç¢„É≥„Ç±„Éº„Éà\\", Shokun!, February 2001, 166. Generally Watanabe's perspective closely echoes the line taken by Japanese generals before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in the Tokyo War Crimes Trial of 1948. Again, with regard to the Japanese history textbook controversies, which followed on Saburo Ienaga's suit against the Japanese Education Ministry, Watanabe was almost alone in controverting the general consensus of editorialists writing for the Japanese mainstream press (Mainichi Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun), and upholding the Ministry's prerogative to intervene directly in the content of textbooks used in Japanese primary and secondary schools.Watanabe Sh≈çichi,Banken uso ni hoeru In Watanabe's view, the decisive incident leading to Japan's full-scale war on the Chinese mainland, namely the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, is to be read as an underhand Chinese Communist Party plot against Japan, and the versions of history taught in pre-war Japanese school textbooks are more reliable than those available today to students.Watanabe Sh≈çichi, Nenpy≈ç de yomu.

At least 78 people were killed and another 218 injured in the blast. The explosion occurred just two days after a four-day curfew banning vehicle movement in the city was lifted after the al-Askari Mosque bombing (2007), and just hours after 10,000 US troops began the Arrowhead Ripper offensive to the north of Baghdad. Because the site was a Shia mosque, the bombing is presumed to have been the work of Sunnis. The Sinak area where the explosion took place was also the targeted by a suicide car bomber on 28 May 2007, which resulted in 21 deaths. Significance of the mosque Al-Khilani Mosque, 2012 The al-Khulani mosque was named by the Shia in honor of one of their revered four \\"earthly\\" deputies anointed by the Imam Mohammed al-Mahdi (the so-called \\"Hidden Imam\\" who disappeared in the 9th century). The attack Iraq Police said a truck stacked with electric fans and air conditioners was used to deliver the bomb to a parking lot near the Khulani mosque. The U.S. military offered a different version of events, declaring that \\"the truck was loaded with propane tanks and that a suicide driver detonated his bomb when the vehicle became stuck trying to drive over a curb.\\" A preliminary investigation indicated that the truck used in the attack \\"was rigged with TNT a little less than a mile from where it exploded\\". The bomb was set off around 1:45 pm local time (10:45 GMT) outside the mosque which is located in the busy Sinak commercial district of central Baghdad. Jabbar Mohammed al-Kaissi, an eyewitness to the blast was across the street filling a five-liter gas can \\"when a truck carrying what he estimated was 60 canisters of gas exploded, sending canisters flying through the air, creating secondary explosions when they landed as far as 100 yards away.\\" He saw a ball of fire rise into the air and turning back to see the car holding his wife and three daughters saw the wall of the mosque fall on it crushing and killing them. \\"I was frozen by the shock. As I rushed to the car to see if I could save any of them, the gas canisters started to explode one after the other.\\" Besides causing the collapse of the courtyard wall the explosion also destroyed a building just inside the mosque compound. The mosque sanctuary was damaged slightly and the mosque's turquoise dome remained standing. The blast badly burned many worshippers and the resulting rubble buried others. The mosque's imam, Sheik Saleh al-Haidari said the bomb was especially deadly as worshippers were just leaving a prayer service. At least 78 were slain and more than 218 were wounded. Six of the slain had lived in a house behind the mosque. Twenty cars outside the mosque were incinerated and twenty-five nearby shops suffered damages from the attack. Imam Haidari went on to say \\"This attack was planned and carried out by sick souls\\", and that though he was not in the mosque at the time, his office and the room above collapsed in the explosion. Karim Abdullah an eyewitness who was headed to pray at the mosques reported \\"I stopped in shock as I saw the smoke and people on the ground. I saw two or three men in flames as they were getting out of their car.\\" Gunfire was heard in the area following the explosion. Iraqi state television showed \\"black smoke billowing above the skyline as people on the street screamed in anguish. ‚Ä¶storefronts were crumbled and on fire, and more than a dozen nearby cars were set ablaze. Residents walked through the area collecting body parts and unrecognizable chunks of flesh.\\" Many of the casualties were rushed to the nearby Al Kanadi, Al Sadr and Madinat Al Tob hospitals. Reactions Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki condemned the attack he issued a statement blaming the attack on \\"takfiris and terrorists who are focused on violating the sanctuaries and killing innocent lives\\" and said \\"It shows the determination of Saddamists and Takfiris to ignite sectarian violence. [The bombing] scarred the beautiful face of Baghdad by destroying the religious landmarks it has known over the centuries.\\" The deaths at al- Khilani mosque rose the total of Baghdad deaths due to sectarian violence for Tuesday 19 June 2007 to 142 \\"a toll reflecting carnage associated with the months before the U.S. security crackdown in the capital began 14 February.\\" The bombing was the deadliest single attack since a car bomb in a Shiite dominated market killed 127 in central Baghdad on 18 April 2007. Col. Christopher C. Garver a spokesman for the U.S. military, said the bombing \\"demonstrates why [the ongoing operation] Arrowhead Ripper and other operations we'll be conducting this summer are so important. We have to find the car bombs and suicide bombers to prevent this from happening.\\" Iraqi Brig. Gen. Qassim Atta, said that the bombing is a sign of shifting tactics ‚Äì instead of building vehicle bombs outside of the city \\"insurgents are now building car bombs inside Baghdad, hoping to avoid driving through the city and being detected at newly erected security checkpoints.\\" See also * 2007 suicide bombings in Iraq References Category:2007 murders in Iraq Category:Explosions in 2007 Category:Al-Qaeda activities in Iraq Category:Attacks on Shiite mosques Category:Violence against Shia Muslims in Iraq Category:Mass murder in 2007 Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Iraq Category:Terrorist incidents in Iraq in 2007 Category:2000s in Baghdad 2007 Category:June 2007 events in Asia Category:Mosque bombings by Islamists Category:Attacks on religious buildings and structures in Iraq Category:Building bombings in Iraq ","title":"2007 al-Khilani mosque bombing"},{"id":"11849264","text":"The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor also known as CD116 (Cluster of Differentiation 116), is a receptor for granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates the production of white blood cells. The receptor is normally located on myeloblast, mature neutrophil, but not on any erythroid or megakaryocytic lineage cells. It is associated with Surfactant metabolism dysfunction type 4. Structure The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor is a heterodimer composed of at least two different subunits; an Œ± chain, and a Œ≤ chain which is also present in the receptors for IL-3 and IL-5. The Œ± subunit contains a binding site for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The Œ≤ chain is involved in signal transduction. Association of the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits results in receptor activation. Signal transduction Upon dimerisation of the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits the Œ≤ subunit becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues by members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. This leads to association with a Shc adaptor protein. Then Shc interacts with GRB2/SoS complex which results in activation of more downstream molecules in the pathway.

Murphy had connections with Celtic and doubled as an announcer at Parkhead on match days. On 20 September 1958, Gallagher provisionally signed for Celtic and made his full debut on 6 March 1959. Jock Stein signed him as a full professional on the same day. Gallagher was part of the Lisbon Lions squad that won the 1967 European Cup Final, where he scored 4 goals. The same year, Gallagher became the first Scottish-born player to play for the Republic of Ireland when he travelled to Ankara on 22 February 1967 to represent Ireland against Turkey.

It takes its name from Enzio of Sardinia, Frederick II's son, who was prisoner here from 1249 until his death in 1272. The palace was built between 1244-1246 as an extension of the nearby Palazzo del Podest√†, which had proven insufficient for the exigences of the Commune of Bologna. It was therefore initially known as Palatium Novum (\\"New Palace\\"). Three years after the palace completion, Enzio was captured by the Guelphs at the Battle of Fossalta, and after a short stay in Anzola he was moved here, where he remained until his death. Enzio was allegedly left free within the palace by day, but by night he was kept into a cage hanging from the ceiling. He was also allowed to meet women: in his will he mentions three natural daughters, but a legend talks about a fourth son he had from a peasant, Lucia di Viadagola. The son was called Bentivoglio, from the words \\"Amore mio, ben ti voglio\\" that he said to his beloved (meaning \\"My love, I'm fond of you\\"), and he would be the ancestor of the Bentivoglio family, later rulers of Bologna. In 1386 Antonio di Vincenzo finished the Sala dei Trecento (\\"Hall of the Three-Hundred\\"), which was to become the city's archive. The last floor was largely renovated in 1771 by Giovanni Giacomo Dotti. The current Gothic appearance dates from the restoration of 1905 due to Alfonso Rubbiani. On the right of the palace is the access to the chapel of Santa Maria dei Carcerati, where the condemned to death went to. In the first floor was held the Carroccio and the war machines, while in the middle floor were the offices of the praetor and the chapel.

Anthocercis is known as the only Solanaceous plant known to produce resin compounds on glandular trichomes.Lagenheim (2003) Taxonomy The genus, which is placed within the family Solanaceae, was first formally described by botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, Vol. 2: 19 (1806). The type species of the genus is Anthocercis littorea Labill. Anthocercis lies in the subfamily Nicotianoideae. The genus is considered to be part of the tribe \\"Anthocercideae,\\" but the monophyly of this grouping has been called into question.

The genus name Pachypodium is from the Greek for 'thick foot', an allusion to its swollen base, while the species name namaquanum is a reference to Namaqualand. Distribution The succulent plant is native to the arid, rocky mountains of the Richtersveld in the Northern Cape of South Africa and in southern Namibia. It is found in its greatest numbers in the Gariep Centre which has the greatest variety of succulents on earth. Rainfall here occurs mainly in winter and varies from 50 to 150 mm. Extremely arid conditions are to be found in the rain shadows of certain mountain ranges where the rainfall may be 15 mm or less. Thick fog moving inland from the Atlantic coast can add to the precipitation. Temperatures in summer may reach 50 ¬∞C. Description Pachypodium namaquanum is a succulent single-stemmed plant growing to tall. The warty trunk, thickset at the base and tapering to the top, is densely covered in sharp spines. Where damaged, the trunk produces side-branches that immediately curve back to the vertical. The very top of the plant is usually bent to the north, similar to the South American cactus Copiapoa cinerea. There is a crown or tuft of undulate leaves at the apex of the trunk during the growing season which is throughout the winter months. The tubular velvet-textured flowers appear from August to October and result in twin seedpods in a V-shape. These split down one side to release the wind-dispersed plumed seeds. Seen from a distance, the plant has the appearance of a person trudging up a slope whence its common name of halfmens (Afrikaans for 'semi-human'). It is also called elephant's trunk.Mannheimer et al. (eds.): Wildflowers of the southern Namib, 2008, , p.186; Top 10 Ugly Plants. =Conservation= The plant is CITES-listed as an Appendix 1 and 2 species, prohibiting trade unless the necessary certificates and permits have been obtained. The removal of this species by collectors poses a distinct threat to its survival. =Relationships= This plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family. There are 23 species of Pachypodium of which 18 occur in Madagascar and 5 in southern Africa - three of these are succulent spiny shrubs while Pachypodium lealii, also tree-sized, occurs in the Kaokoveld in Namibia.

There have been two dominant schools of thought in the United States about foreign policy, namely interventionism and isolationism which either encourage or discourage foreign intervention respectively.  Post-colonial  Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders after capturing San Juan Hill during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898) The 19th century saw the United States transition from an isolationist, post-colonial regional power to a Trans-Atlantic and Trans-Pacific power. The first and second Barbary Wars of the early 19th century were the first nominal foreign wars waged by the United States post-Independence. Directed against the Barbary States of North Africa, the Barbary Wars were fought to end piracy against American-flagged ships in the Mediterranean Sea, similar to the Quasi- War with post-monarchical France. The founding of Liberia was privately sponsored by American groups, primarily the American Colonization Society, but the country enjoyed the support and unofficial cooperation of the United States government.Flint, John E. The Cambridge History of Africa: from c.1790 to c.1870 Cambridge University Press (1976) pg 184-199 The 19th century formed the roots of United States interventionism, which was largely driven by economic opportunities in the Pacific and Spanish-held Latin America along with the Monroe Doctrine, which saw the U.S. seek a policy to resist continued European colonialism in the Western hemisphere. Notable 19th century interventions included: * Repeated U.S. interventions in Chile, starting in 1811, the year after its independence from Spain. * 1846 to 1848: Mexico and the United States warred over Texas, California and what today is the American Southwest but was then part of Mexico (see Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War). During this war, U.S. troops invaded and occupied parts of Mexico, including Veracruz and Mexico City. * 1854: Matthew Perry negotiated a treaty opening Japan to the West with the Convention of Kanagawa. The U.S. advanced the Open Door Policy that guaranteed equal economic access to China and support of Chinese territorial and administrative integrity. * 1898: The short but decisive Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War saw overwhelming American victories at sea and on land against the Spanish Kingdom. The U.S. Army, relying significantly on volunteers and state militia units, invaded and occupied Spanish-controlled Cuba, subsequently granting it independence. The peace treaty saw Spain cede control over its colonies of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. The U.S. Navy set up coaling stations there and in Hawaii.William Braisted, United States Navy in the Pacific, 1897‚Äì1909 (2008) The early decades of the 20th century saw a number of interventions in Latin America by the U.S. government often justified under the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. President William Howard Taft viewed \\"Dollar Diplomacy\\" as a way for American corporations to benefit while assisting in the national security goal of preventing European powers from filling any possible financial or power vacuum. Middle America, showing the places affected by Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs Big Stick policy World War I propaganda poster for enlistment in the U.S. Army * 1898 to 1935: The United States launched minor interventions into Latin America. These included military presence in Cuba, Panama with the Panama Canal Zone, Haiti (1915‚Äì35), Dominican Republic (1916‚Äì24) and Nicaragua (1912‚Äì1925) & (1926‚Äì33). The U.S. Marine Corps began to specialize in long-term military occupation of these countries, primarily to safeguard customs revenues which were the cause of local civil wars.Lester D. Langley, The Banana Wars: United States Intervention in the Caribbean, 1898‚Äì1934 (2001) * 1899 to 1901: The Boxer Rebellion saw an eight-nation alliance put down a rebellion by the Boxer secret society and toppled the Qing dynasty's Imperial Army. * 1899 to 1902: The Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War saw Filipino revolutionaries revolt against American rule following the Spanish-American War. The U.S. Army deployed 100,000 (mostly National Guard) troops under General Elwell Otis to the Philippines, leading the poorly armed and poorly trained rebels to break off into armed bands. The insurgency collapsed in March 1901 when the leader Emilio Aguinaldo was captured by General Frederick Funston and his Macabebe allies.Brian McAllister Linn, The Philippine War 1899‚Äì1902 (University Press of Kansas, 2000). * 1899 to 1913: The Moro Rebellion saw the annexation of the Philippines by the United States. * 1901: The Platt Amendment amended a treaty between the U.S. and Cuba after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, virtually making Cuba a U.S. protectorate. The amendment outlined conditions for the U.S. to intervene in Cuban affairs and permitted the United States to lease or buy lands for the purpose of the establishing naval bases, including Guant√°namo Bay. * 1903: U.S.-backed independence of Panama from Colombia in order to build the Panama Canal; Hay‚ÄìBunau-Varilla Treaty * 1904: When European governments began to use force to pressure Latin American countries to repay their debts, Theodore Roosevelt announced his \\"Corollary\\" to the Monroe Doctrine, stating that the United States would intervene in the Western Hemisphere should Latin American governments prove incapable or unstable. * 1906 to 1909: U.S. governed Cuba under Governor Charles Magoon. * 1909: U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua depose President Jos√© Santos Zelaya. * 1910 to 1919: The Border War along the U.S.-Mexico border saw U.S. forces occupy Veracruz for six months in 1914. **1914 to 1917: Mexico conflict and Pancho Villa Expedition, U.S. troops entering northern portion of Mexico. * 1912 to 1933: United States occupation of Nicaragua. * 1914: During a revolution in the Dominican Republic, the U.S. navy fired at revolutionaries who were bombarding Puerto Plata, in order to stop the action. * 1915 to 1934: United States occupation of Haiti.U.S. Invasion and Occupation of Haiti, 1915-34 * 1916 to 1924: U.S. Marines occupied the Dominican Republic following 28 revolutions in 50 years. The Marines ruled the nation completely except for lawless parts of the city of Santo Domingo, where warlords still held sway. * 1917 to 1918: The U.S. intervened in Europe during World War I. Over the next 18 months, the U.S. would suffer casualties of 116,708 killed and 204,002 wounded. U.S. troops also intervened in the Russian Civil War against the Red Army via the Polar Bear Expedition. = World War II = M4 Sherman tank equipped with a flamethrower clearing a Japanese bunker on Iwo Jima during the Second World War During the Second World War, the United States deployed troops to fight in both Europe and the Pacific. The U.S. was a key participant in many battles, including the Battle of Midway, the Normandy landings, and the Battle of the Bulge. In the time period between December 7, 1941 to September 2, 1945, more than 400,000 Americans were killed in the conflict. After the war, American and Allied troops occupied both Germany and Japan. The United States also gave economic support to a large number of countries and movements who were opposed to the Axis powers. This included the Lend-Lease program, which \\"lent\\" a wide array of resources and weapons to many countries, especially Great Britain and the USSR, ostensibly to be repaid after the war. In practice, the United States frequently either did not push for repayment or \\"sold\\" the goods for a nominal price, such as 10% of their value. Significant aid was also sent to France and Taiwan, and resistance movements in countries occupied by the Axis.  Cold War  Following the Second World War, the U.S. helped form the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949 to resist communist expansion and supported resistance movements and dissidents in the communist regimes of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union during a period known as the Cold War. One example is the counterespionage operations following the discovery of the Farewell Dossier which some argue contributed to the fall of the Soviet regime. After Joseph Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade, the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began the massive \\"Berlin airlift\\", supplying West Berlin with up to 4,700 tons of daily necessities.Nash, Gary B. \\"The Next Steps: The Marshall Plan, NATO, and NSC-68.\\" The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society. New York: Pearson Longman, 2008. P 828. U.S. Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created \\"Operation Vittles\\", which supplied candy to German children. In May 1949, Stalin backed down and lifted the blockade. The U.S. spent billions to rebuild Europe and aid global development through programs such as the Marshall Plan. Jacobo √Årbenz attempted a modest redistribution of land, he was overthrown in the 1954 CIA Guatemalan coup d'√©tat From 1950 to 1953, U.S. and UN forces fought communist Chinese and North Korean troops in the Korean War, which saw South Korea successfully defended from invasion. U.S. troops remained in South Korea to deter further conflict, as the war has not officially ended. President Harry Truman was unable to roll back the North Korean government due to Chinese intervention, but the goal of containment was achieved. During the Cold War, the U.S. frequently used the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for covert operations against governments considered unfriendly to U.S. interests. In 1949, under U.S. President Harry Truman, a coup overthrew an elected parliamentary government in Syria, which had delayed approving an oil pipeline requested by U.S. international business interests in that region. The exact role of the CIA in the coup is controversial, but it is clear that U.S. governmental officials, including at least one CIA officer, communicated with Husni al- Za'im, the coup's organizer, prior to the March 30 coup and were at least aware that it was being planned. Six weeks later, on May 16, Za'im approved the pipeline. In 1953, under U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, the CIA helped Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran remove the democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadegh (although supporters of U.S. policy claimed that Mossadegh had ended democracy through a rigged referendum). In 1954, the CIA launched Operation PBSuccess, which deposed the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo √Årbenz and ended the Guatemalan Revolution. The coup installed the military dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas, the first in a series of U.S.-backed dictators who ruled Guatemala. Guatemala subsequently plunged into a civil war that costed thousands of lives and ended all democratic expression for decades.CDI: The Center for Defense Information, The Defense Monitor, \\"The World At War: January 1, 1998\\". The CIA armed an indigenous insurgency in order to oppose the invasion and subsequent control of Tibet by ChinaConboy, Kenneth and Morrison, James, The CIA's Secret War in Tibet (2002). and sponsored a failed revolt against Indonesian President Sukarno in 1958. As part of the Eisenhower Doctrine, the U.S. also deployed troops to Lebanon in Operation Blue Bat. Covert operations continued under President John F. Kennedy and his successors. In 1961, the CIA attempted to depose Cuban president Fidel Castro through the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The invasion was doomed when President Kennedy withdrew U.S. air support at the last minute. The CIA also considered assassinating Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba with poisoned toothpaste (although this plan was aborted).Gott 2004 p. 219. In 1961, the CIA supported the overthrow of Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic. After a period of instability, U.S. troops invaded the Dominican Republic in Operation Power Pack (April 1965) to prevent a Communist takeover. Without collaborators, a U.S. invasion against an army united with the people would have been difficult and costly in lives; in an optimistic estimate, the Pentagon believed that at least two full U.S. divisions were required to overcome the extensive armament the Dominican Republic had acquired as protection against a Haitian invasion. President John F. Kennedy meeting with Cheddi Jagan in October 1961. The trip was a political disaster for Jagan, who failed to sooth the suspicions of Kennedy and Congress by equivocating on Cold War issues. At the end of the Eisenhower administration, a campaign was initiated to deny Cheddi Jagan power in an independent Guyana. This campaign was intensified and became something of an obsession of John F. Kennedy, because he feared a \\"second Cuba\\". By the time Kennedy took office, the United Kingdom was ready to decolonize British Guiana and did not fear Jagan's political leanings, yet chose to cooperate in the plot for the sake of good relations with the United States. The CIA cooperated with AFL-CIO, most notably in organizing an 80-day general strike in 1963, backing it up with a strike fund estimated to be over $1 million. The Kennedy Administration put pressure on Harold Macmillan's government to help in its effort, ultimately attaining a promise on July 18, 1963, that Macmillan's government would unseat Jagan. This was achieved through a plan developed by Duncan Sandys whereby Sandy, after feigning impartiality in a Guyanese dispute, would decide in favor of Forbes Burnham and Peter D'Aguiar, calling for new elections based on proportional representation before independence would be considered, under which Jagan's opposition would have better chances to win. The plan succeeded, and the Burnham-D'Aguiar coalition took power soon after winning the election on December 7, 1964. The Johnson administration later helped Burnham fix the fraudulent election of 1968‚Äîthe first election after decolonization in 1966. To guarantee Burnham's victory, Johnson also approved a well-timed Food for Peace loan, announced some weeks before the election so as to influence the election but not to appear to be doing so. U.S.‚ÄìGuyanese relations cooled in the Nixon administration. Henry Kissinger, in his memoirs, dismissed Guyana as being \\"invariably on the side of radicals in Third World forums.\\" From 1965 to 1973, U.S. troops fought at the request of the governments of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia during the Vietnam War against the military of North Vietnam and against Viet Cong, Pathet Lao, and Khmer Rouge insurgents. President Lyndon Johnson escalated U.S. involvement following the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. North Vietnam invaded Laos in 1959, and used 30,000 men to build invasion routes through Laos and Cambodia.The Economist, February 26, 1983. North Vietnam sent 10,000 troops to attack the south in 1964, and this figure increased to 100,000 in 1965.Washington Post, April 23, 1985. By early 1965, 7,559 South Vietnamese hamlets had been destroyed by the Viet Cong.Readers Digest, \\"The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh\\", November 1968. The CIA organized Hmong tribes to fight against the Pathet Lao, and used Air America to \\"drop 46 million pounds of foodstuffs....transport tens of thousands of troops, conduct a highly successful photoreconnaissance program, and engage in numerous clandestine missions using night-vision glasses and state-of-the-art electronic equipment.\\"Leary, William M. \\"CIA Air Operations in Laos, 1955-1974.\\" CIA.

North Vietnam violated the Paris Peace Accords after the US withdrew, and all of Indochina had fallen to communist governments by late 1975. Chilean General Augusto Pinochet with George H. W. Bush In 1975 it was revealed by the Church Committee that the United States had covertly intervened in Chile from as early as 1962, and that from 1963 to 1973, covert involvement was \\"extensive and continuous\\". In 1970, at the request of President Richard Nixon, the CIA planned a \\"constitutional coup\\" to prevent the election of Marxist leader Salvador Allende in Chile, while secretly encouraging Chilean generals to act against him.Falcoff, Mark, Kissinger and Chile, Commentary, 2003. The CIA changed its approach after the murder of Chilean general Ren√© Schneider,Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders (1975), Church Committee, pages 246‚Äì247 and 250‚Äì254. offering aid to democratic protestors and other Chilean dissidents. Allende was accused of supporting armed groups, torturing detainees, conducting illegal arrests, and muzzling the press;\\"Declaration on the Breakdown of Chile's Democracy,\\" Resolution of the Chamber of Deputies, Chile, August 22, 1973. See also The Wall Street Journal's \\"What Really Happened in Chile\\"* historian Mark Falcoff therefore credits the CIA with preserving democratic opposition to Allende and preventing the \\"consolidation\\" of his supposed \\"totalitarian project\\". However, Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, which led to years of dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet. In 1973, Nixon authorized Operation Nickel Grass, an overt strategic airlift to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel during the Yom Kippur War, after the Soviet Union began sending arms to Syria and Egypt. From 1972‚Äì5, the CIA armed Kurdish rebels fighting the Ba'athist government of Iraq. Months after the Saur Revolution brought a communist regime to power in Afghanistan, the U.S. began offering limited financial aid to Afghan dissidents through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, although the Carter administration rejected Pakistani requests to provide arms. After the Iranian Revolution, the United States sought rapprochement with the Afghan government‚Äîa prospect that the USSR found unacceptable due to the weakening Soviet leverage over the regime.Rubin, Michael, \\"Who is Responsible for the Taliban?\\", Middle East Review of International Affairs, Vol. 6, No. 1 (March 2002). The Soviets invaded Afghanistan on December 24, 1979 to depose Hafizullah Amin, and subsequently installed a puppet regime.

U.S. and UN forces later supervised free elections in Cambodia. Under Reagan, the US sent troops to Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War as part of a peace-keeping mission. The U.S. withdrew after 241 servicemen were killed in the Beirut barracks bombing. In Operation Earnest Will, U.S. warships escorted reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers to protect them from Iranian attacks during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The United States Navy launched Operation Praying Mantis in retaliation for the Iranian mining of the Persian Gulf during the war and the subsequent damage to an American warship. The attack helped pressure Iran to agree to a ceasefire with Iraq later that summer, ending the eight-year war., p. 217. Under Carter and Reagan, the CIA repeatedly intervened to prevent right-wing coups in El Salvador and the U.S. frequently threatened aid suspensions to curtail government atrocities in the Salvadoran Civil War. As a result, the death squads made plans to kill the U.S. Ambassador.Washington Post, February 24, July 13, 1980 (Carter); New York Times, November 20, 26, December 12, 1983 (Reagan); New York Times, June 24, 1984, Washington Post, June 27, 1984 (Ambassador) In 1983, after an internal power struggle ended with the deposition and murder of revolutionary Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, the U.S. invaded Grenada in Operation Urgent Fury and held free elections. In 1986, the U.S. bombed Libya in response to Libyan involvement in international terrorism. President George H. W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama (Operation Just Cause) in 1989 and deposed dictator Manuel Noriega. A 2016 study by Carnegie Mellon University professor Dov Levin found that the United States intervened in 81 foreign elections between 1946 and 2000, with the majority of those being through covert, rather than overt, actions.The U.S. is no stranger to interfering in the elections of other countries, Los Angeles Times, (December 21, 2016).  Post-Cold War  The U.S. intervened in Kuwait after a series of failed diplomatic negotiations, led a coalition to remove the Iraqi invader forces, in what became known as the Gulf War. On 26 February 1991, the coalition succeeded in driving out the Iraqi forces. In 1991, the U.S. and the UK along with France responded to popular Shia and Kurdish demands for no-fly zones, and intervened and created no-fly zones in Iraq's south and north to protect the Shia and Kurdish populations from Saddam Hussein. The no-fly zones would stay active for 12 years until the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and cut off Saddam from the country's Kurdish north, effectively granting autonomy and long-lasting safety to the Kurds. In the 1990s, the U.S. intervened in Somalia as part of UNOSOM I, a United Nations humanitarian relief operation. The mission saved hundreds of thousands of lives. During the Battle of Mogadishu, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in a brief but bitter street firefight; 18 Americans and more than 300 Somalis were killed. Under President Bill Clinton, the U.S. participated in Operation Uphold Democracy, a UN mission to reinstate the elected president of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, after a military coup.John R. Ballard, Upholding Democracy: The United States Military Campaign in Haiti, 1994‚Äì1997 (1998) In 1995, Clinton ordered US and NATO aircraft to attack Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on UN safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement. In response to the 1998 al- Qaeda bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa that killed a dozen Americans and hundreds of Africans, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on targets in Afghanistan and Sudan.

The CIA was involved in the failed 1996 coup attempt against Saddam Hussein. In 1998, the U.S. became involved in major paramilitary efforts in Colombia (Plan Colombia) to eliminate drug trafficking.  War on Terror  opposing War on Terror led by Bush administration. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, under President George W. Bush, the U.S. and NATO launched the War on Terror, which saw an intervention to depose the Taliban government in the Afghan War and drone attacks in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia against suspected terrorist targets. In 2003, the U.S. and a multi-national coalition invaded Iraq to depose Saddam Hussein. As of , Afghanistan continues to host U.S. and NATO counterinsurgency operations under the aegis of Operation Resolute Support and Operation Freedom's Sentinel, while the Iraq War officially ended on December 18, 2011. The U.S. has used large amounts of aid and counterinsurgency training to enhance stability and reduce violence in war-ravaged Colombia, in what has been called \\"the most successful nation-building exercise by the United States in this century\\". The U.S. intervened in the 2011 Libyan Civil War by providing air support to rebel forces. There was also speculation in The Washington Post that President Barack Obama issued a covert action, discovering in March 2011 that Obama authorized the CIA to carry out a clandestine effort to provide arms and support to the Libyan opposition. Muammar Gaddafi was ultimately overthrown and killed. The U.S. Navy has actively participated in the Saudi Arabian-led naval blockade of Yemen.\\"U.S. carrier moving off coast of Yemen to block Iranian arms shipments\\". USA Today. 20 April 2015. Beginning around 2012, under the aegis of operation Timber Sycamore and other clandestine activities, CIA operatives and U.S. special operations troops trained and armed nearly 10,000 Syrian rebel fighters at a cost of $1 billion a year until it was phased out in 2017. Al-Tanf, Syria began in early 2016 during the American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War. 2013‚Äì2014 saw the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terror organization in the Middle East. In June 2014, the U.S. re- intervened into Iraq and began airstrikes against ISIL there in response to prior gains by the terrorist group that threatened U.S. assets and Iraqi government forces. This was followed by more airstrikes on ISIL in Syria in September 2014, where the U.S.-led coalition targeted ISIL positions throughout the war-ravaged nation. Initial airstrikes involved fighters, bombers, and launching Tomahawk cruise missiles. In March 2015, President Barack Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \\"Joint Planning Cell\\" with Saudi Arabia. A 2016 study published in the Journal of Conflict Resolution (published by the University of Maryland) analyzing U.S. military interventions in the period 1981-2005 found that the U.S. \\"is likely to engage in military campaigns for humanitarian reasons that focus on human rights protection rather than for its own security interests such as democracy promotion or terrorism reduction.\\" See also * United States involvement in regime change * American imperialism * American exceptionalism * United States territorial acquisitions * List of armed conflicts involving the United States * List of the lengths of United States participation in wars * Military history of the United States * Historic regions of the United States * Manifest Destiny * Foreign interventions by the Soviet Union * Foreign interventions by China * Foreign interventions by Cuba * Foreign electoral intervention * New Imperialism References External links * (Alternate link) *The Truth About U.S. Middle East Policy, from The Middle East Review of International Affairs * ‚ÄúWhen the Great Power Gets A Vote: The Effects of Great Power Electoral Interventions on Election Results‚Äù by Dov H.

Soviet Unterzoegersdorf () is a fictitious country created by the art/technology/theory group monochrom. It is the \\"last existing appanage republic of the USSR\\", located inside the Republic of Austria. Unterz√∂gersdorf is partially based on an existing villageso2/rhizomatic architecture, 2009 well-known to Johannes Grenzfurthner, the creator of the concept. As a kid and teenager, Grenzfurthner spent a lot of time at his grandparents' farm in the small village of Unterz√∂gersdorf (a cadastral municipality of Stockerau). His grandparents' stories about the Nazism, WWII and the Soviet occupation in allied-occupied Austria (1945‚Äì1955) form the inspirational basis of the long- term project Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.FM4: \\"Kurzbesuch in Sowjet- Unterz√∂gersdorf\\", 23 July 2002 :In the early 2000s, notorious Austrian art group monochrom decided to have a little fun with the spirit of (nostalgia for the Soviet era), the cultural whiplash from the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union a decade earlier. monochrom founder Johannes Grenzfurthner, having been born well after the USSR ceded East Austria in 1955, realized he knew nothing about the Soviet occupation of his hometown, the tiny rural hamlet of Unterzoegersdorf, aside from the hyperbolic, implausibly demonic stories his grandmother had told him when he was young. He was curious about that era, but the older generation was unwilling to talk. (Considering the shame of Anschluss followed by ten years of Soviet annexation, could anyone blame them? As Grenzfurthner himself put it, \\"We Austrians are known for two things: Classical music and mass murder.\\") Leave the past behind, they said. No one wants to remember Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.\\"in soviet unterzoegersdorf, game play you\\", ERF_, 11 December 2010 Debates triggered by postmodern culture have directed monochrom's attention towards questions of representation and relevance of \\"history\\" and stories. With Soviet Unterzoegersdorf a fictitious and misplaced handling of the past and the present is being discussed and put to use. In this regard, the project is also taking part in the production as well as the criticism of cultural and collective memories. Monochrom transformed the basic theoretical concept into various projects (LARPs, computer games, short films, performances). Short film (1999) A short film (\\"Der Installateur (bis 14:28)\\") about a plumber trying to cross the border of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf to repair a nuclear warm-water boiler. Public theatre performances (2001 and 2002) In 2001, ten years after the end of the Soviet Union, monochrom transformed the theoretical concept into an improvisational theatre/performance/LARP that lasted for a couple of days. They organized bus tours from Vienna to Unterzoegersdorf‚Äîa small Lower Austrian village that really exists‚Äîand acted the setting; beginning with the harsh EU Schengen border control. In 2002 they staged the 55th anniversary of the Communist Party of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. Among other things monochrom presented a computer called \\"Hyper Hegel\\" that was powered with burning wood and that would only run a low tech version of Tetris. Later \\"Hyper Hegel\\" was presented as an art installation in exhibitions. Computer game series (2005‚Äì) * Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector I In 2005 monochrom presented the first part of a computer game trilogy: \\"Soviet Unterzoegersdorf ‚Äì The Adventure Game\\" (using AGS). To monochrom it was clear that the adventure game would provide the perfect media platform to communicate the idea of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf. The first part of the game was very popular and was well received in the media.Un saut chez les Soviets, in: Lib√©ration (by Marie Lechner), April 28, 2006 The game magazine Edge chose the game as their 'internet game of the month' of November 2005.The Edge, Internet Game of the Month, November 2005 The back story of the adventure game series features the really existing Tumulus of Unterzoegersdorf. * Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector II Cory Doctorow as character in monochrom's adventure game \\"Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector 2\\" (2009) Soviet Unterzoegersdorf: Sector II was presented on December 28, 2008 at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin.

Interventions (2008‚Äì) Johannes Grenzfurthner (as \\"His Excellency Ambassador of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf, Nikita Chrusov\\") and Tim O'Reilly at O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, 2008 In 2008 monochrom staged a couple of public appearances of \\"His Excellency Ambassador of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf, Nikita Chrusov\\" in the United States. The \\"Ambassador\\" (played by monochrom member Johannes Grenzfurthner) visited a corporate afterparty of Disney.com at the Marriott Hotel in San Diego (part of O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference). He wanted to talk to executives about \\"the sugar-coated bullets\\" the corporation is firing at \\"his country\\" and other concepts of \\"cultural imperialism\\". The \\"Ambassador\\" got expelled from the party by Disney personnel. On September 11, 2009 the \\"Soviet Unterzoegersdorf Intelligence Corps\\" released a press statement referring to a pretty detailed list of Austrian civilian and military air traffic frequencies and recordings of two embarrassing conversations on Austrian police radio. Sierra Zulu (2011‚Äì) monochrom announced on September 12, 2011 that they are working on a feature-length film that is set in the universe of Soviet Unterzoegersdorf.

However, the term is also used in a number of specific senses. Several origins have been proposed for the word. According to Merriam-Webster, \\"goof\\" is likely a variation of \\"goff\\" in an English dialect, meaning simpleton. Some say the word may come from an identically pronounced Hebrew word meaning \\"body\\", some even say it was just a mistake happened while typing the word \\" good\\", hence the word \\"goof\\" is also known as other word for mistake. Others believe that it was inspired by the Disney character, Goofy (though it is more likely that the character got his name from the word, not the word from the character). See the etymological explanation of Hessu Hopo, 'Goofy' in Finnish language. There is a Spanish word, \\"gofio,\\" which refers to the balls of toasted flour and salt eaten by the original inhabitants of the Canary Islands. In Latin America (esp. Cuba) the word \\"comegofio\\" (lit. \\"gofio-eater\\") came to refer to anyone from the Canaries, stereotyped as primitive or stupid. Cinema In filmmaking, a goof is a mistake made during film production that finds its way into the final released picture. Depending upon the film and the actual scene, the goof may have different effects: a loss in realism, an annoyance, or it could just be funny. It is often a type of continuity error. Goofs are also known as \\"bloopers\\"Normally used on the IMDb site for bloopers. or \\"mistakes\\". There are several types of goofs, for example: * Somebody or something from the film crew is in the picture that wasn't planned (e.g., camera and cameraman is reflected in a mirror, or the microphone is visible, a rope pushing a character over is visible, a hook pulling a character up in the air is visible). * Chronological or conditional errors (e.g. a cigarette getting longer with the next scene, a cup or glass gaining in volume in the next scene, damage to a building that disappears, or moved props) * Historical inaccuracies and anachronisms (e.g., an HDTV set in a film set in the 1970s, radio tower in cowboy movie). * scientific errors of script errors (e.g. in Hollywood Henrietta claims that here twins are from Jake because it runs in his familie, but this kind of twins can occurs only by femalal ancestry.) * Geographic: an object or landmark reveals the scene was filmed in a different city than the city it is set. This is very common in Hollywood films that are shot in Canada. * Problems in audio or soundtrack (e.g. a dog barking before its mouth moves, a person's lips carry on moving after they have finished speaking). * Intertitles displaying wrong words (e.g. a character called \\"John\\" may have his name misspelled Jhon in the subtitles by accident). * Editing errors, where dialog or events in one scene refer to material that occurred in a prior scene in the screenplay, but which was deleted in the final cut of the film. Goofs can be found in a large number of films and Episodes, even in very expensive productions. Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope for example has been counted to have 200 goofs in it, ranging from disappearing props, to a storm trooper hitting his head on an opening door, and in The In the Night Garden Episodes \\"Tombliboos Clean their Teeth\\" & Mr Pontipine's Moustache Flies Away, where in the tombliboos clean their teeth episode, a fly goes across the screen when the tombliboos scream twice so 2 goofs, and in the pontipine moustache episode one of the bridge's railings disappear in the story.

The regiment recruited its members starting on July 15, 1862, from the 4th Congressional District which included the Michigan counties of Barry, Ionia, Montcalm, Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon, Oceana, Newaygo, Mecosta, Mason, Manistee, Grand Traverse, Leelanau, Manitou, Osceola, Emmet, Mackinac, Delta, and Cheboygan. The 21st Michigan Infantry rendezvous was at Ionia. The 21st Michigan Infantry, a company of William Tecumseh Sherman's veterans. Among the ranks were future prominent Michigan politicians John Avery and Charles E. Belknap. The regiment left its quarters at Ionia, Michigan, on the 12th of September in command of Colonel Stevens, 1,008 strong, under orders to report at Cincinnati. It was immediately pushed forward into Kentucky via Louisville, and became early engaged in the realities of war. A beautiful silk flag was provided by the ladies of Ionia and delivered to the 21st Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment on 6 September 1862, at that city. The center of the flag was decorated with the American eagle, holding its quiver of arrows, olive branch, etc. Over this a small National flag, and beneath it the words \\"Union,\\" \\"Constitution.\\" An excellent speech was made by L. B. Soule, Esq., on behalf of the ladies, to which Colonel A. A. Stevens, commanding the regiment, appropriately replied. Afterwards speeches were made by Z. Chandler, T. W. Ferry, and F. W. Kellogg. At the same time there was presented a flag by the children of the Grand Haven Sunday-schools to Company G of the regiment. The flag given to the regiment was carried through all of its engagements, brought back to the State, and at a celebration on July 4, 1865, was formally returned, on behalf of the regiment, to the ladies by the Hon. John Avery, of Greenville, the highest- ranking officer of the regiment present, and was received on behalf of the ladies by the Hon. John B. Hutchins, of Ionia. On 1 October, the 21st Michigan broke camp at Louisville and entered upon a long march through Kentucky. On the 8th it bore an important part in the Battle of Perryville in Kentucky. In this battle, the 21st Michigan suffered a loss of 24 wounded (1 mortally) and 3 missing, Colonel Stevens being among the wounded. 21st Michigan in the West From Perryville the regiment moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and on November 4, 1862, proceeded to Nashville, arriving there on the 12th and encamped, remaining there until the general advance of General Rosecrans on Murfreesboro. The 21st Michigan left Nashville on 26 December 1862, with the army, in command of Lieutenant Colonel McCreery, and was engaged at Lavergne on the 27th, and at Stewart's creek on the 29th. It participated with Sill's brigade of Sheridan's division in the five days' Battle of Stone's River, sustaining a loss of 17 killed, 85 wounded, including Captain Leonard O. Fitzgerald, mortally, and 37 missing. The regiment, in command of Colonel McCreery, Colonel Stevens having resigned on account of ill health, remained at Murfreesboro, employed on picket duty and as guard for forage trains, until June 24, 1863, when it advanced with the army on Tullahoma. During July 1863 the regiment was stationed at Cowan and Anderson Station, on the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad. Subsequently, it occupied Bridgeport, under General Lytle, who commanded the brigade to which the 21st was attached. September 2, 1863, the regiment crossed the Tennessee, and advanced with the corps of Major General McCook to Trenton, Ga., from whence it crossed the mountains to Alpine, 30 miles from Rome; thence made a forced march toward Chattanooga, between the mountain ranges, and came into line of battle at Chickamauga September 19, 1863. The following day the regiment participated in the battle of Chickamauga, sustaining a loss of 11 killed, 58 wounded, 35 missing, 3 prisoners. Of the missing, 21 were known to be wounded. Lieutenant Colonel M. B. Wells was among the killed, and Captain Edgar W. Smith, being mortally wounded, died October 13 following, while Colonel McCreery, commanding the regiment, was severely wounded and taken prisoner. In this engagement the regiment belonged to the same brigade as at Stone River, and then commanded by General Lytle, was serving in Sheridan's division of the 4th corps. On September 20, while the division was advancing to the support of General Thomas, it became heavily engaged, and captured prisoners from four different rebel divisions. The 21st was in the hottest of the fight, behaved with great courage, never yielding except when overcome by immense odds, but after a brave but fruitless effort against a perfect torrent of the enemy was compelled to give way. After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment, in command of Lieutenant Colonel S. K. Bishop, was detached from its brigade by order of General Thomas, and was placed under General Smith, Chief Engineer of the Department, and performed duty as engineer troops, forming part of Engineer Brigade, and was on that duty during the engagement of Mission Ridge. It was stationed, until the 11th of June, 1864, on the north side of the Tennessee River, near Chattanooga, and was employed in building a bridge over the river, and in the erection of storehouses in Chattanooga. At the above date the regiment was ordered to Lookout Mountain, where it was engaged in building hospitals, running mills, and in the performance of the usual picket duty, until the 20th of September following, when it was relieved from further duty with the Engineer Corps. On the 27th of September the regiment left Lookout Mountain for Tullahoma, thence it proceeded to Nashville. Joining the forces under General Rosseau, it participated with them in the pursuit of the rebels under General Forrest, beyond Florence, Ala., returning to Florence on the 11th of October. On the 14th, the regiment was ordered to Chattanooga, and on the 18th to proceed to and garrison Dalton, Ga. On the 30th of October, the regiment was relieved at Dalton, and was ordered to join its corps. During the year it had traveled between 480 and 500 miles. On November 1, 1864, the 21st, then in command of Colonel Bishop, was at Dalton, Ga., where it received orders to march to Kingston and join the 14th army corps, and on arriving there was assigned to the 2d brigade, 1st division, when it started for Atlanta, and on the march assisted in tearing up the railroad track and destroying everything in its rear, reaching that point on the 15th, and on the following day after the destruction of that place, moved with General Sherman's army towards Milledgeville, arriving there on the 22d, and then took up a line of march in the direction of Augusta, and on reaching within about forty miles of that point, turned directly south towards Savannah, and arrived at the works in front of that place on the 10th of December, and there relieved a part of the 20th army corps, which held a portion of the works on the south side of the canal, being the most exposed position on the whole line. There the men being obliged to stay in the trenches, without tents and lightly clad, few of them having blankets, suffered extremely from cold, and also from hunger, as their rations were short. The regiment continued in that position until the 15th, when it moved back north of the canal, and remained there until the evacuation of Savannah on the 21st, and then encamped about three-fourths of a mile from the city. During the 25 days occupied on the march from Atlanta, only two and a half days' rations had been issued to the regiment, it being mainly supplied with subsistence procured by foraging on the inhabitants of the country through which it passed. The regiment remained at Savannah, refitting, reclothing the men, and getting ready for the campaign through the Carolinas, until the 20th of January, 1865 following, when in command of Captain A. C. Prince, it marched up along the Savannah river to Sister's Ferry, where it lay until the 5th of February, then crossed into South Carolina, still continuing the movement in the vicinity of the river until nearly opposite Columbia, when a direction was taken towards that point, and on arriving there turned to the left, crossed the Black and Saluda rivers, and struck the railroad at Winnsboro, where it assisted in destroying the track as far north as Blackstock Station; then changing the direction eastward, crossed the Great and Little Pedee rivers about eight miles north of Cheraw, then crossed the Wateree at Rocky Mountain, on pontoons made from wagon boxes covered with tent flies and canvas, the high water having carried away the pontoon bridge. While crossing, the brigade, being the rear guard, was much annoyed by the enemy's cavalry, but succeeded in getting over the entire corps' train, when the march was resumed in the direction of Fayetteville, N. C. Reaching there, Cape Fear river was crossed on the 13th of March, and moving forward, met the enemy at Averysboro on the 16th, and after a severe engagement he retreated during the night; continuing the march, again encountering the enemy at Bentonville, on the 19th, where the regiment became heavily engaged, losing six officers and eighty-six men, killed and wounded, out of 230, and after the retreat of the enemy from that point the march was resumed, and crossing the Neuse river, arrived at Goldsboro on the 25th, after a march of sixty-four days from Savannah, during which time only twelve days' rations had been issued to the regiment, the main supply having been obtained by foraging on the country on the line of march. The regiment remained in camp near Goldsboro until April 11, when again in command of Colonel Bishop, a movement was commenced in the direction of Raleigh. Reaching there on the 14th, it then marched to Haywood, on Cape Fear river, where it remained until the surrender of Johnston's army, when the regiment, with its division and corps, started for Richmond, in company with the 20th corps. The two corps being destined for the same point, entered on a friendly race, which resulted in the 1st division, 14th corps, in which was the 21st Michigan, reaching that point ahead of any other troops, marching 280 miles in less than eight days. From Richmond the march was continued to Washington, D. C., where the regiment participated in the review of General Sherman's army on the 24th of May, and on the 8th of January was mustered out of service, when it proceeded to Michigan, arriving at Detroit on the 13th, and on the 22d was paid off and disbanded. The 21st participated in encounters with the enemy at Perryville, Ky., October 8, 1862; Lavergne, Tenn., December 27, 1862; Stewart's Creek, Tenn., December 29, 1862; Stone River, Tenn., December 29, 31, 1862, and January 1, 2, and 3, 1863; Tullahoma, Tenn., June 24, 1863; Elk River, Tenn., July 1, 1863; Chickamauga, Ga., September 19, 20, and 21, 1863; Chattanooga, Tenn., October 6, 1863; Brown's Ferry, Tenn., October 27, 1863; Mission Ridge, Tenn., November 26, 1863; Savannah, Ga., December 11, 18, 20, and 21, 1864; Averysboro, N. C., March 16, 1865; Bentonville, N. C., March 19, 11, 1865. The reports of the regiment show a membership of 1,477 officers and men. The regiment was mustered out of service on June 8, 1865. Total strength and casualties The regiment suffered 3 officers and 80 enlisted men who were killed in action or mortally wounded and 3 officers and 291 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 377 fatalities.http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmiinf3.htm#21st The Civil War Archive website after Dyer, Frederick Henry.

It was first published with the second (1713) edition of the Principia and reappeared with some additions and modifications on the third (1726) edition.The General Scholium online, trans. Andrew Motte, 1729. It is best known for the \\"Hypotheses non fingo\\" (\\"I do not frame hypotheses\\") expression, which Newton used as a response to some of the criticism received after the release of the first edition (1687). In the essay Newton not only counters the natural philosophy of Ren√© Descartes and Gottfried Leibniz, but also addresses issues of scientific methodology, theology, and metaphysics. Rejecting Cartesian vortices In the first paragraph of the General Scholium, Newton attacks Ren√© Descartes' model of the solar system. Descartes and his supporters were followers of mechanical philosophy, a form of natural philosophy popular in the 17th century which maintained that nature and natural beings act similar to machines. In his book The World, Descartes suggests that the creation of the solar system and the circular motion of the planets around the Sun can be explained with the phenomena of \\"swirling vortices\\".Descartes, Ren√©. The World and Other Writings. Trans. Stephen Gaukroger. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998. Descartes also claimed that the world is made out of tiny \\"corpuscles\\" of matter, and that no vacuum could exist.Shea, William. The Magic of Numbers and Motion: The Scientific Career of Ren√© Descartes, Canton, MA: Science History Publications, 1991. Descartes' model did not cohere with the ideas introduced in the first edition of the Principia (1687). Newton simply rejected Descartes' \\"corpuscles and vortices\\" theory and suggested that gravitational force acts upon celestial bodies regardless of the vast empty interstellar space in between.James E. McClellan III and Harold Dorn, Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999, p. 258. Newton was publicly criticised by Cartesians on this non- mechanistic theory. As a response to this criticism, Newton argued that Descartes' Vortices cannot explain the unique movement of comets. He sums up the paragraph with the words:  Scientific method argument  Newton did not offer any reasons or causes for his law of gravity, and was therefore publicly criticised for introducing \\"occult agencies\\" into science.Westfall, Richard S. Never at Rest: A biography of Isaac Newton. Cambridge University Press, 1980. Newton objected to Descartes' and Leibniz's Scientific method of deriving conclusions by applying reason to a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence, and famously stated \\"hypotheses non fingo\\", Latin for \\"I do not frame hypotheses\\": The General Scholium then goes on to present Newton's own approach to scientific methodology. Contrary to the deductive approach of Descartes and Leibniz, Newton holds an inductive approach to scientific inquiry. Phenomena should first be observed, and then general rules should be searched for, and not vice versa. It is this approach, states Newton, that has led to the discovery of \\"the laws of motion and gravitation\\":  Theological views  Most of the General Scholium deals with Newton's religious views. However, it is also considered the least understood part of the essay. Newton saw God as an intelligent, powerful, omnipresent Being which governs all. It has been claimed that the text implies that Newton was an anti-Trinitarianist heretic. With no comments explicitly addressing the subject of the Holy Trinity, several parts of the text seem to raise anti- Trinitarianist positions indirectly, most notably:  \\"The Spirit\\"  The General Scholium ends with a mystifying paragraph about a \\"certain most subtle Spirit, which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies.\\" It has been largely interpreted as Newton's view and prospect of electricity, a phenomenon of which little was known at the time. Newton describes some attributes of this Spirit and concludes: References  External links  * The Newton Project Canada: The General Scholium online version and interpretation * \\"Newton Reconsidered\\": Interview with prof.

Biblical account of Tobiah's actions =Opposition to Nehemiah's rebuilding effort= Tobiah was an Ammonite official (possibly a governor of Ammon, possibly also of Jewish descent). He incited the Ammonites to hinder Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild Jerusalem. He, along with Sanballat the Horonite and Geshem the Arabian, resorted to a stratagem and, pretending to wish a conference with Nehemiah, invited him to meet them at Ono, Benjamin. Four times they made the request, and every time Nehemiah refused to come. Their object was to frighten him from completing the restoration of Jerusalem's walls and to do him some kind of harm. Tobiah also had married a daughter of Shecaniah, a Judahite leader, and had given his son, Jehohanan, in marriage to the daughter of Meshullam, another Judahite leader, for ostensibly political purposes. Because of this, he somehow gained enough of a Judahite coalition to use the Judahites themselves to send letters to Nehemiah, telling him of Tobiah's \\"good deeds\\" in an apparent attempt to weaken Nehemiah's resolve to keep Tobiah out of the rebuilding effort. Tobiah meanwhile sent intimidating letters directly to Nehemiah. =Acquisition of the temple storerooms= Additionally, Tobiah exploited his relationship with High Priest Eliashib, whose grandson had married the daughter of Sanballat. He persuaded Eliashib to lease the storerooms of the temple to him, so that he could conduct business in the newly constructed temple. These storerooms had been intended for the Israelites' grain offerings, incense, temple articles, and the tithes of grain, new wine and oil meant for the work of the temple and the temple workers themselves. Upon hearing this, Nehemiah, who was then in Babylon serving Artaxerxes I of Persia, requested permission to return to Judah. After returning, he promptly threw all of Tobiah's belongings out of the temple room, purified the room, and put back all that had originally been there. Identity It is possible, though uncertain, that Tobiah the Ammonite may be related to other Tobiahs mentioned in extra-biblical sources. The Lachish Ostraca mention a Tobiah who is a \\"servant of the king\\". Josephus later mentions a rich and influential Tobiad family from around the geographic region of Ammon, which may be descended from or otherwise related to this same Tobiah.

Located near Niobrara, Nebraska, not far downstream from the confluence of the Niobrara River with the Missouri, it joins Nebraska Highway 14 to South Dakota Highway 37. The bridge is named for Standing Bear, a Ponca chief born and buried nearby, who was the plaintiff in Standing Bear v. Crook, a landmark 1879 U.S. District Court case that established the legal rights of Native Americans to move about freely. History Before the bridge was constructed, Highway 14 ended at the Missouri. Travellers who needed to cross the river had to detour downstream to the Meridian Bridge at Yankton, South Dakota, or upstream to Fort Randall Dam near Pickstown, South Dakota. A seasonal ferry, closed in the winter, crossed the river at Niobrara for some time; but it ceased operation in 1984. Local residents had sought a bridge since the 1920s. Construction of a toll bridge began in 1931; but it was ended by the Great Depression. In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt vetoed a bill passed by the U.S. Congress that would have allowed construction to proceed; in 1940, he signed a revised bill to permit construction, but the shortage of materials caused by World War II thwarted it. A third effort was stymied by the Korean War; a fourth attempt failed in the early 1980s. With the support of U.S. Representative Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, funds continued to be appropriated intermittently for the bridge. In 1995, the U.S. Congress passed a transportation appropriations bill that gave Nebraska and South Dakota enough money to complete the bridge. The project was attacked by television journalist Tom Brokaw, in a series titled \\"The Fleecing of America\\", as an unnecessary expenditure of federal money. However, funding survived and construction proceeded. Of the bridge's $17 million cost, about $14 million came from the federal government; the remaining $3 million was supplied by the two states. The groundbreaking ceremony for the bridge was held on April 20, 1996; dedication ceremonies were held on August 29, 1998. During the 2011 Missouri River floods the bridge became a dead end on the Nebraska side when that approach was flooded. Many Nebraska residents who worked at the Mike Durfee State Prison on the South Dakota side took to using makeshift motor boats, kayaks, chest waders and a homemade ‚Äúswamp bikes‚Äù to commute between the bridge and their cars out of the flood area‚Äîa process which took 30 minutes or more.http://www.omaha.com/article/20110712/NEWS01/707129933 Tourism The bridge is a part of the Missouri River Trail, within the Missouri National Recreational River along with the Vermillion‚ÄìNewcastle Bridge south of Vermillion, South Dakota, and the Meridian Highway Bridge at Yankton.

The Iranian objective was to cut off the road from Basra to Baghdad in the central sector. The attack started on a rainy day and hope was that cloud cover would shield them from Iraqi air attacks. Once the clouds lifted, Iraq conducted 150 air sorties, which generated a 3 to 1 kill ratio of Iranians to Iraqis. The Iraqis, sensing the efficacy of close air attacks, directed aerial bombings on the cities of Dezful, Ahvaz, and Khoramshahr in retribution for the Iranian Dawn 1 offensive.

The Romans had also provided their support to many Greek coastal cities and islands (like Apollonia and Corfu) members of the Aetolian League, which fought against Macedon and the rest of Greece in search of independence. The Seleucid kings of Syria and Attalus I of Pergamon were stirring trouble on the eastern borders of Macedon. Philip V, therefore, needed a powerful ally to halt Rome's expansion towards the Balkans and mitigate the danger on Macedon's western border. Hannibal seemed the perfect candidate. Diplomatic mission Livy, the Roman historian of the 1st century, narrates in Ab Urbe condita (\\"Since the founding of Rome\\"), Liber XXIII, 33-39, how Philip, having observed Hannibal's victories, sent a delegation in the summer of 215 BC to meet him on the Italic peninsula to secure an alliance.Bringmann, K. & W. J. Smyth. A History of the Roman Republic. Polity, 2007, , , pp. 78‚Äì83.Michelet, Jules (W. Hazlitt, transl.). History of the Roman Republic. London: D. Bogue, 1847, pp. 185‚Äì88Mommsen, T., Bryans, C., & F.R.J. Hendy. The History of the Roman Republic: Abridged from the History by Professor Mommsen. C. Scribner's sons, 1889, pp. 401‚Äì08. The Greek ambassadors, avoiding the most obvious points of disembarkation from Greece, Brindisi and Taranto, landed near Capo Colonna, in Calabria, by the temple of Juno Lacinia. From there, they moved towards Capua, where Hannibal had set up headquarters, hoping not to be intercepted by Roman legions. Unable to avoid detection, the delegation was escorted to the praetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus for questioning. The Athenian commander Xenophanes, leader of the expedition, improvised by declaring that the delegation had been sent by king Philip to secure an agreement of amicitiam societatemque (friendship and alliance) with the Roman people. The praetor welcomed the delegation and sent it on its way to Rome, providing an escort and key tactical information on where the Carthaginians were camped. Armed with this knowledge, the Macedonians reached Hannibal's camp with little effort completing their assigned mission.Robinson, Cyril E. A History of the Roman Republic. Rome: Barnes & Noble, 1932, pp. 310-317.

[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Cod. Urb. folio 96 exc. ant. p. 193.] This is a sworn treaty made between Hannibal, Mago, Barmocarus, and such members of the Carthaginian Gerousia as were present, and all Carthaginians serving in his army, on the one part; and Xenophanes, son of Cleomachus of Athens, sent to us by King Philip, as his ambassador, on behalf of himself, the Macedonians, and their allies, on the other part. [omitted: gods by whom the oath is taken] Hannibal, general, and all the Carthaginian senators with him, and all Carthaginians serving in his army, subject to our mutual consent, proposes to make this sworn treaty of friendship and honourable good-will. Let us be friends, close allies, and brethren, on the conditions herein following: *Let the Carthaginians, as supreme, Hannibal their chief general and those serving with him, all members of the Carthaginian dominion living under the same laws, as well as the people of Utica, and the cities and tribes subject to Carthage, and their soldiers and allies, and all cities and tribes in Italy, Celt-land, and Liguria, with whom we have a compact of friendship, and with whomsoever in this country we may hereafter form such compact, be supported by King Philip and the Macedonians, and all other Greeks in alliance with them. *On their parts also King Philip and the Macedonians, and such other Greeks as are his allies, shall be supported and protected by the Carthaginians now in this army, and by the people of Utica, and by all cities and tribes subject to Carthage, both soldiers and allies, and by all allied cities and tribes in Italy, Celt-land, and Liguria, and by all others in Italy as shall hereafter become allies of the Carthaginians. *We will not make plots against, nor lie in ambush for, each other; but in all sincerity and good- will, without reserve or secret design, will be enemies to the enemies of the Carthaginians, saving and excepting those kings, cities, and ports with which we have sworn agreements and friendships. *And we, too, will be enemies to the enemies of King Philip, saving and excepting those kings, cities, and tribes, with which we have sworn agreements and friendships. *You shall be friends to us in the war in which we now are engaged against the Romans, till such time as the gods give us and you the victory: and you shall assist us in all ways that be needful, and in whatsoever way we may mutually determine. *And when the gods have given us victory in our war with the Romans and their allies, if Hannibal shall deem it right to make terms with the Romans, these terms shall include the same friendship with you, made on these conditions: first, the Romans not to be allowed to make war on you; second, not to have power over Corcyra, Apollonia, Epidamnum, Pharos, Dimale, Parthini, nor Atitania; (3) to restore to Demetrius of Pharos all those of his friends now in the dominion of Rome. *If the Romans ever make war on you or on us we will aid each other in such war, according to the need of either. *So also if any other nation whatever does so, always excepting kings, cities, and tribes, with whom we have sworn agreements and friendships. *If we decide to take away from, or add to this sworn treaty, we will so take away, or add thereto, only as we both agree. The capture Once the treaty was completed, the delegation and Carthaginians officers Mago, Gisgo and Bostar, undertook the return journey to Macedonia to obtain Philip's signature.Lancel, S. (Nevill, A. transl.). Hannibal. Blackwell Publishing, 1999, , , p. 117. Their ship was, however, intercepted by Roman warships led by Valerius Flaccus, who did not believe Xenophanes' story and ordered a search of the vessel and its occupants. The discovery of Punic apparel and of the treaty itself prompted Flaccus to send the delegation as prisoners to Rome on five ships, so as to keep them separate and limit the risk of escape. After a brief stop in Cumae for further interrogation by consul Tiberius Sempronius Graccus, the delegation faced the Senate and was incarcerated. Only one member of the delegation managed to escape and return to Macedon, where he was unable to fully recollect the exact terms of the treaty to king Philip. Therefore, Philip was forced to send a second delegation to meet Hannibal and draft the agreement anew.Cottrell, L. Hannibal: Enemy of Rome. Da Capo Press, 1992, , , pp. 156-9. In response to the threat presented by the Macedonian-Carthaginian alliance, the Senate decreed that twenty-five ships be added to the contingent already under Flaccus' command and sent to Apulia, where they were expected to monitor Philip's movements.Hoyos, B. Dexter. Unplanned Wars: The Origins of the First and Second Punic Wars. Walter de Gruyter, 1998, , , p. 151. In reality, because summer had elapsed by the time the second delegation reached Hannibal and concluded the treaty, its terms were never executed (military operations were usually suspended in winter). Furthermore, the discovery of the alliance by the Roman senate nullified the element of surprise, which greatly diminished the treaty's value in the context of the Second Punic War.Bagnall, N. The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage, and the Struggle for the Mediterranean. Macmillan, 2005, , , pages 168, 200-3.Bagnall, N. The Punic Wars, 264-146 BC: 264-146 BC. Osprey Publishing, 2002, , , pages 56, 61, 66. Nevertheless, the discovery of the treaty led to debates in the Roman Senate about how to handle Macedonia and, eventually led to the outbreak of the First Macedonian War (214-205 BC). This conflict was centred largely in Illyria (modern-day Albania) but included Greece due to Rome's allies there simultaneously waging war against Macedonia.Errington, Robert Malcolm (1990).

Background information  In December 2002, while eating at a local marketplace in Fasa, Iran, Reza and his friend were confronted by a group of older men who verbally assaulted the two teenagers. The verbal altercation escalated, and one member of the group that had initiated the confrontation with Reza and his friend pulled out a weapon and began to beat the teens.http://helpreza.blogsky.com/ In an attempt to defend himself and his friend against the attack, Reza pulled out a pocket knife, and while covering his face and eyes from the blows with his left hand, he attempted to ward off his attackers with the knife in his right hand. As Reza struggled with his attackers in this manner, he stabbed one of them with the knife. The stabbing ultimately led to the attacker's death, and Reza was arrested on charges of murder and was sentenced to death by hanging. During the initial investigation of this case, a number of exculpatory facts were established for the record, including the testimony of the decedent‚Äôs friend, who was present when the altercation took place. The eyewitness admitted that he and his friend were the ones who had started the altercation, and without provocation from Reza and his friend, they had attacked the two teenagers with their weapons. The eyewitness testified that the teenagers did not have any way of escaping the altercation as they were surrounded and overpowered. They were severely beaten, leaving them with serious injuries that required them to be hospitalized. As such, the eyewitness admitted that the attacks that he and his by-then deceased friend's actions were so aggressive that he could understand why Reza and his friend had acted as they had to defend their lives. Another eyewitness‚Äîwho was not a participant in the altercation‚Äîconfirmed these facts. His testimony, in addition to other evidence in the case, left little doubt that Reza had engaged in self-defense, and that he had no choice but to use necessary force to save his own life as well as that of his younger friend. Despite evidence supporting Reza's claim that he stabbed the man in self-defense, as well as the fact that he was a minor at the time of the incident, Reza Alinejad was sentenced to qesas- retribution- for murder by Section 6 of the Criminal Court in Fasa on October 4, 2003. When the case reached Iran's highest court for review in December 2004, this death sentence was rejected by the judge, who accepted that the teenager had acted in self-defence. The judge acknowledged that the instigators of the dispute were the dead man and his friend, that they had attacked Reza Alinejad and his friend with the nunchaku and had injured them, and that the stabbing by Reza Alinejad had not been intentional. The Supreme Court remanded the case to another lower court for review. The case was heard for a second time by branch 101 of Fasa Criminal Court. On June 15, 2005, the lower court sentenced Reza to death again, concluding that he could have fled the scene and had therefore acted unreasonably. On May 9, 2006, Iran's Supreme Court upheld the death sentence. According to Lily Mazahery, an Iranian- American human rights lawyer and a human rights advocate who has worked on a number of similar cases, the rulings in Reza's case violated international law and standards. This is because at the time of the incident, Reza was a minor. Article 37 of the Convention on the Right of the Child, to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a signatory, prohibits the execution of individuals for acts or crimes committed before the age of majority. Reza's death sentence drew widespread criticism from human rights organizations and advocates around the world, including the issuance of Urgent Action Alerts by Amnesty International to stop the execution. Reza's case was transferred to Iran's Head of Judiciary Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi for review. Reza's brother, Meghada Alinejad, along with other members of Reza's family, have pleaded for international help.Letter of Meghdad Alinejad, Reza's brother In December 2007, in a letter to Nazanin Afshin-Jam, Reza's brother, Ali Alinejad sent the copy of the mediation order by Iran's head of judiciary that stated: \\"Considering the age of the convicted and the unintentional circumstances that he was faced, the file is ordered to be returned to judiciary court in (city of) Fasa. Through Mediation council or by any other means; more efforts and attempts must be made in order to bring a resolution between parents of the victim and the murder convict.\\" Release Reza was released on December 3, 2008 after the victim's family (Dooroodi) demanded and accepted financial compensation (diyeh, blood money).Amnesty International The Alinejad family spoke to SCE (Stop Child Executions) President Nazanin Afshin-Jam shortly after his release to thank the team for all efforts to help save Reza. Reza maintains his innocence and says that the death of Esmail Dooroodi was as a result of defending himself against him and the other attacker Mohammad Firouzi.SCE News Friday, December 12, 2008 See also * Stop Child Executions Campaign * Delara Darabi * Nazanin Fatehi * Mosleh Zamani * Atefeh Rajabi * Human rights in Iran * Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran) References External links * Help Reza Campaign * Save Delara campaign on Reza * Save Reza blog * Myspace page dedicated to Reza * Polish campaign for Delara on Reza Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian prisoners sentenced to death Category:Children's rights Category:Iranian criminals Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Iran Category:Human rights abuses in Iran ","title":"Reza Alinejad"},{"id":"11849835","text":"Nicola Mingazzini (born 13 August 1980) is an Italian footballer who currently plays as a midfielder for Lucchese.

Approximately 10,000 students aged 14 and above study at three campuses in Willesden, Wembley Park and Kings Cross. Ofsted recently gave CNWL a grade of Good (January 2016). In August 2017, the College of North West London legally merged with City of Westminster College (CWC) to form United Colleges Group. However, both CNWL and CWC are maintaining public use of their original names, logos and identities.  History  CNWL can trace it roots back to 1891, and the formation of Willesden Polytechnic, on the site of its former campus in Kilburn. From 1893, the Willesden committee for technical education organized classes in Willesden Town Hall. In 1896 Middlesex County Council bought the St. Lawrence institute in Priory Park Road, and by 1898 The Willesden Polytechnic was formed, with 1,571 students. A new building was developed for the polytechnic, opening in 1904 on Glengall Road, Kilburn. As World War I took a toll on the male working-class population, the polytechnic offered a course in 1917 to women between the ages of 18 to 35 in light woodwork for aeroplane components. From 1932, Middlesex County Council undertook a large development in Willesden, and in 1934 split the polytechnic into Kilburn Polytechnic (on the original site), and the new Willesden College of Technology. By 1934, the original St. Lawrence Institute building had been demolished, and replaced by the present four-storey block. By 1978 there were 1,400 full-time and 4,500 part-time enrolments. Willesden College of Technology opened in Denzil Road in 1934, to provide the technical courses originally provided by the polytechnic, including the schools of art and building. In 1964 the college took over the buildings of Dudden Hill Lane school. The art school closed in 1959, and in 1969 the school of building amalgamated with other schools to form Swaminarayan School Sladebrook High School. There were 8,000 enrolments in 1978. In 1991, the sites again merged, to become the College of North West London (CNWL).  Today  CNWL now offers a broad range of courses, from entry level through to Foundation Degrees, Apprenticeships and HNC/HNDs. On- site facilities are for enrolled students. Its Hair and Beauty Salons at the Wembley Campus are open to the public. The College provides qualifications and training courses to school leavers, adults learners and employers in around 20 sectors including construction, computing, engineering and care. = Willesden campus = Developed in 1934 as the Willesden College of Technology, Willesden is the college's main centre. It is situated in Dudden Hill Lane, five minutes' walk from Dollis Hill Underground station on the Jubilee line. The entrance is now located on Denzil Road. Courses range from Access courses (entry to university), BTEC Diplomas and Certificates and GCSEs to Foundation degrees and higher education qualifications. The Telford building was opened officially in March 2009 by Lord Young of the government's Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. It provides high quality training facilities for the Faculty of Technology. The front building viewed from Dudden Hill Lane (known as \\"Edison\\") of the Willesden Campus was demolished in 2015 and there are plans to replace it with a new multimillion-pound facility. Planning permission is yet to be submitted. The main entrance is currently located on Denzil Road. = Wembley Park campus = This campus is now based at Crescent house, located just outside Wembley Park Underground station in Wembley Park. Teaching in English, Maths, Business, Accounting and hair and beauty is based at this Campus. The Hair and Beauty salons are open to the general public. The building was refurbished in 2012 and re-opened in November 2012 by Gino D'Acampo = King's Cross = Since Summer 2016 the college has managed the King's Cross Construction Skills Centre, in partnership with Camden Council. The Centre provides training in the construction sector for full-time and part-time students, and for apprentices. = Kilburn campus (Closed 2010) = The original part of the site dates to 1890, with Art Deco additions in the 1930s with the development of Kilburn Polytechnic. A brand new ¬£5-million college centre was opened in Priory Park Road on 31 August 2007 by the then Mayor of London Ken Livingstone. The Mayor told guests \\"To come here and see something as beautiful as this ‚Äì it makes you want to do a course just to enjoy the building.\\" He also added that \\"this college has been designed as a role model for what we want across London, which is to give people the opportunity to get in on the first rung of education and get the skills they want in life.\\" Principal Vicki Fagg described the building as \\"architecturally stunning\\", while assistant principal Malcolm Rapier remarked: \\"It is a real statement for further education students and for Kilburn.\\" In May 2008, the centre won second prize in the RIBA / LSC Further Education Design Excellence Awards, with the judges complementing the college on its contribution to the regeneration of Kilburn. In March 2010, the college announced that it would close operations at Kilburn from September 2010. The courses taught at Kilburn were transferred to the college's sites at Willesden and Wembley. In November 2010, the local Times newspaper reported that the college was planning to sell the Kilburn campus. 4. The sale of the site was completed in 2014.

It was launched by Iran. Prelude The Iranians originally planned the offensive to mark the fourth anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. Objectives were clear: drive enemy forces from Iranian soil, seize Iraqi territory in the Amarah area, and move on to Amarah. Seizure of the city of Amarah would give Iran the upper hand in disrupting troop and supply movements from Baghdad to Basra. U.S. Intelligence reported that both sides had over 100,000 soldiers poised for battle. The Iranian forces consisted of mostly 'last reserve' Pasdaran and Basij volunteers backed by two divisions of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army. Iraqi forces consisted mostly of conscript infantry backed by Republican Guard tank brigades. In addition, the Iraqis also held three lines of trenches which formed a semicircle around Amarah. The terrain of the battleground added to Iran's difficulty. The area around Amarah rested in an area of sand hills and marshes of which created an open plain. To this affect, Iraqi trenches were strategically positioned from the sand hills down to the tip of the marshes. Regardless, Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani further boasted: The people expect this offensive to be the final military operation that will determine the destiny of the region. The battle Operation Fajr al-Nasr (Before the Dawn/Dawn of Victory), launched on 6 February 1983, and it saw the Iranian shift of focus from the southern to the central and northern sectors. Iran, using 200,000 \\"last reserve\\" Revolutionary Guard troops, attacked along a 40 kilometres (25 mi) stretch near Al Amarah, Iraq about 200 kilometres (120 mi) southeast of Baghdad. One armoured division proceeded to Sumar in the central zone as a diversion to mask seven reserve infantry divisions that went from the southern sector to the central city of Dezful. The Iraqis knew about this concentration of forces and knew that an inevitable mass human wave assault would occur in the central zone, yet did nothing to disrupt what would be Operation Before the Dawn, which began in February 1983.[64] This was Iran's long-awaited plan to take the war inside Iraq on a grand scale. The Iranians wanted to penetrate and capture the cities of al- Shabeeb and al-Amarah, and to reach the highways linking Baghdad down to Amarah and further down to Basra. In the south, a massive Iranian force of two infantry and two armoured divisions, three border guard regiments, an airborne regiment, a Basij division, and two artillery battalions attempted to isolate Basra from the rest of Iraq.[64] Facing the Iranians was the Iraqi 4th Corps, which was made up of two infantry divisions, one mechanized division, and two armoured divisions. The al-Shabeeb assault was stalled by 60 kilometers of hilly escarpments, forests and river torrents blanketing the way to Amarah. Once the Iranians finally arrived near Amarah, Iraqi air force fighters thwarted Iranian close air support, but the Iraqi counter-attack was also hindered and the various attacks and counter-attacks regressed into entrenchment and artillery duels. The Iranians dug themselves in along the entire front lines, from north to south, and although Iraq countered the assault on al-Shabeeb, it did not result in Iraq's tactical advantage as these thousands of entrenched Iranian forces now concentrated artillery fire on Basra, Khanaqhin, and Mandali.[64] By the middle of the offensive, Tehran Radio reported having liberated over of Iranian territory (which in fact was one of several disputed territories). The reality was much more bleak, however, as Iran continually resorted to crude tactics, including the use of soldiers in human wave charges across no man's land, which was always met with withering fire from the Iraqis. Lightly equipped, inadequately supported, and poorly trained Iranians attempted to charge dug-in Iraqi infantrymen firing from trenches. In addition, Iranian teenage soldiers died by the hundreds, and some were captured after being wounded. Residents of the city of Ahvaz, behind the front, reported that their morgue was filled to the rim with bodies from the field. Personal account The following is a rare excerpt of a child soldier's experience during this operation. It has been cited from Ian Brown's, Khomeini's Forgotten Sons: The Story of Iran's Boy Soldiers\\": > After only a month's training at a camp near Khorramshahr, I was sent to the > front. When we arrived we all assembled in a field where there must have > been a thousand of us, some younger than me, and old men as well. The > commander told us we were going to attack an Iraqi position north-east of > Basra which guarded the road to Qurna, to try to capture the road. The > following morning we set off at 4:00 A.M. in army trucks, and I had been > given a gun and two hand grenades. The trucks stopped at the Iranian front > and they told everyone to get out. The sun was beginning to come up as we > started walking towards the Iraqi lines, and boy, was I scared! We'd been > told the position was three kilometers away. As we got nearer, we could hear > shells exploding, and I think it was us shelling them. When we got to the > top of a hill, we started running down the other side towards the enemy > position. I wasn't afraid any more. We all shouted, \\"Allah akbar\\" (God is > great) as we ran, and I could see soldiers in front of us - a line of > helmets - then they started firing. People dropped all around me, but I kept > running and shouting while many were being killed. By the time I reached the > trenches, I'd thrown my grenades and somehow had lost my gun, but I don't > remember how.

Aftermath Iran managed to regain of its own territory (part of the disputed territory). But after a week of stalemate, Iran abandoned the operation after making only minimal gains against the Iraqis. Rafsanjani later retracted his earlier boast, saying that the offensive was not the last as expected. As for the Iraqis, this victory helped the poorly motivated and shaken ground forces to boost their morale. The Iranians suffered tremendous casualties clearing minefields and breaching Iraqi anti-tank mines surrounding Basra, which Iraqi engineers were unable to replace. Iraq deployed its navy as a diversion and destroyed Iranian patrol craft in the Iranian port of Khor- Musa. The Iraqi Air Force was also effectively deployed, with fixed wing fighters massing fires on Iranian formations in the southern sector. After this battle, the vicious cycle of Iranian human wave assaults continued but not to the level of Operation Before the Dawn, or of the previous massive Iranian assaults of 1982.[64] In addition during April 1983, the Mandali- Baghdad northcentral sector witnessed fierce fighting, as Iranian attacks were stopped by Iraqi mechanised and infantry divisions. Casualties were high, and by the end of 1983, an estimated 120,000 Iranians and 60,000 Iraqis had been killed during the whole war. Despite these losses, in 1983 Iran held the advantage in the war of attrition.[6]:2 By this time, it was estimated that no more than 70 Iranian fighter aircraft were still operational at any given time, for that reason helicopters were more often used for close air support, because Iran had their own facilities from before the revolution to repair them[58] [64] Bibliography # The Last Blow, TIME Magazine, Feb. 21, 1983. # Khomeini's Forgotten Sons: The Story of Iran's Boy Soldiers, Grey Seal Books, 1990. # The Longest War, by Dilip Hiro, Routledge, Chapman, and Hall, Inc. 1991. # http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-%E2%80%9Cdawn-of- victory%E2%80%9D-campaigns-to-the-%E2%80%9Cfinal-push%E2%80%9D-part-three-of- three References * History of Iran: Iran‚ÄìIraq War 1980-1988 * http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/SRE.htm Category:Military operations of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1983 Category:Amarah ","title":"Operation Before the Dawn"},{"id":"11849879","text":"Konrad Kyeser, illustration on his Bellifortis manuscript (Cod. Ms. philos. 63) Konrad Kyeser (26 August 1366 - after 1405) was a German military engineer and the author of Bellifortis (c. 1405), a book on military technology that was popular throughout the 15th century. Originally conceived for King Wenceslaus, Kyeser dedicated the finished work to Rupert of Germany. A native of Eichst√§tt, Kyeser was trained as a physician and lived at the court in Padua before he joined the crusade against the Turks which ended in disaster at the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396. Kyeser lived in exile in a mountain village in Bohemia during the reign of Sigismund in 1402 to 1403. Bellifortis War wagon (Clm 30150 manuscript) Rider with kite (Clm 30150 manuscript) During his time in exile, Kyeser began to write his book on the military arts. The book is the most prominent illustrated treatise on military engineering of the Late Middle Ages. There are at least twelve surviving 15th- century manuscripts which copy, excerpt, or amplify the work. One of these is the Thott Fechtbuch of Hans Talhoffer (1459). The book is divided into ten chapters, though there are also issues with the full content divided into 7 chapters. The topics of the chapters include cars, siege engines, hydraulic engines, elevators, firearms, defensive arms, \\"wondrous secrets\\", fireworks for warfare, fireworks for pleasure, and auxiliary tools. The diving suit presented in the book has precedents reaching back to the 12th century and to Roger Bacon. The book also has the earliest known depiction of a chastity belt. Kyeser counts the artes magicae among the mechanical arts, and his work contains various applications of magic in warfare. =Editions= The original codex is kept in the G√∂ttingen University library (Cod.

I, facsimile edition in color, edited, with German translation, introduction and notes by G√∂tz Quarg (D√ºsseldorf) 1967; extensively reviewed by Lynn White, Jr, in Technology and Culture, 10,.3 (July 1969: 436-441) History Konrad Kyeser wrote his treatise between 1402 and 1405 when he was exiled from Prague to his hometown of Eichst√§tt.Long, pp. 105-108 Many of the illustrations for the book were made by German illuminators who were sent to Eichst√§tt after their own ousting from the Prague scriptorium.Lef√®vre, pp. 67-72 The work, which was not printed until 1967, survived in a single original presentation manuscript on parchment at University of G√∂ttingen,Codex Ms. philos. 63; four early drafts of the finished text (1402-04) also survive. bearing the date 1405, and in numerous copies, excerpts and amplifications, both of the text and of the illustrations, made in German lands. Design Bellifortis was written in Latin and contained many elaborate illustrations of war weaponry. The manual discusses machines and technology that were old and new. It described weapons such as trebuchets, battering rams, movable portable bridges, cannons, rockets, chariots, ships, mills, scaling ladders, incendiary devices, crossbows, and instruments of torture. The portrait of the author is called by its modern editor the first realistic portrait of an author since Antiquity.Quarg, noted in White (1969:438). Kyeser‚Äôs viewpoint was that warfare in the broadest sense was most effective if looked at from all angles, which included astrology and sorcery. His manual presented the technology of the art of war through the association of education and Latin letters. The book was of a large expensive format. It had elaborate illustrations and lavish drawings of a large number of war devices and machines. The treatise was designed more for a prince or king than for an engineer. Kyeser believed his war manual would make other armies run in all directions. His treatise often made reference to antiquity, especially the war tactics of Alexander the Great. He writes that Alexander had many war technical abilities. In one illustration he shows Alexander with a rocketlike war weapon in his hands with the mysterious letters: MEUFATON. In another illustration Alexander is shown as the supposed inventor of a very large war carriage. Kyeser writes that Alexander was not only a great inventor of war devices but was able to use them himself. Alexander is portrayed with magical abilities. Dedication Springald illustration from Konrad Kyeser's book Bellifortis Konrad dedicated his finished treatise to the weak Ruprecht III in a bitter response to his exile. He emphasizes in the dedication the relationship of technical knowledge to technical skills. He writes of the German soldiers, \\"Just as the sky shines with stars, Germany shines forth with liberal disciplines, is embellished with mechanics, and adorned with diverse arts.\\" At the end of the treatise, Kyeser gives a markedly unusual appearance of himself. He portrays himself as a dying worried person. He even provides his own epitaph, \\"May my soul be joined to your very high one.\\" Legacy The Bellifortis is survived in 45 manuscripts and was either copied completely or partly, and sometimes amplified, in several later manuscripts.

Launched in 1906, she served as the flagship of the China Station before the First World War. Shortly after the war began, the ship searched unsuccessfully for the German East Asia Squadron and was transferred to the Grand Fleet at the end of 1914. During the rest of the war Minotaur served as the flagship of the 7th and 2nd Cruiser Squadrons and spent most of her time assigned to the Northern Patrol. In mid-1916 she participated in the Battle of Jutland but did not fire her weapons during the battle. The ship was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap the following year.

Her secondary armament, ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns, were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti-torpedo boat defence was provided by sixteen QF 12-pounder (three-inch) 18-cwt guns.\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 18 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. Minotaur also mounted five submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes, one of which was mounted in the stern.Burt, p. 94 The waterline belt consisted of of Krupp cemented armour roughly between the fore and aft 7.5-inch gun turrets, but was reduced in steps to three inches to the ends of the ship. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour. The thickness of the lower deck was . The armour of the conning tower was thick.Burt, p. 86 Construction and career Minotaur was ordered as part of the 1904‚Äì05 naval construction programme as the last of three armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 2 January 1905 at Devonport Royal Dockyard and was christened on 6 June 1907 by the Countess of Crewe. The ship suffered a coal gas explosion that injured three sailors and one dockyard worker on 6 November before she was commissioned on 1 April 1908.Burt, p. 87 Minotaur cost ¬£1,410,356.Parkes, p. 447 The ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon commissioning. She escorted the royal yacht Victoria and Albert from Kiel, Germany to Reval when King Edward VII and his wife visited in Russia in June. The next month Minotaur escorted the battlecruiser as it carried the Prince of Wales to Canada to commemorate the tercentenary of Quebec City. The ship was transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron when the Home Fleet reorganized on 24 March 1909. She was present for two fleet reviews in June and July before she was ordered to the China Station in January 1910 to relieve as flagship. Minotaur was in Wei Hai Wei on 3 July 1914 when most of the ships assigned to the China Station were ordered to assemble at Hong Kong. Shortly after the start of the First World War, the ship, together with the armoured cruiser and the light cruiser sailed for the German-owned island of Yap. They captured the collier Elsbeth on 11 August and destroyed the radio station there with gunfire. They then unsuccessfully searched for the ships of the East Asia Squadron until the light cruiser was reported to have destroyed several ships in the Bay of Bengal in mid-September. Minotaur was ordered to the west coast of Sumatra to search for the German warship, but was unsuccessful. She was then ordered to escort a troop convoy from Wellington, New Zealand in late September.Burt, pp. 87, 89 The ship was detached from the convoy and ordered to proceed to the Cape of Good Hope and reinforce the squadron there on 6 November after the Admiralty learned of the defeat at the Battle of Coronel.Corbett, I, pp. 367 Upon her arrival Minotaur became flagship of the Cape of Good Hope Station under the command of Vice Admiral Herbert King-Hall and escorted a South African troop convoy to Luderitz Bay in German South-West Africa.Corbett, II, p. 234 The ship was near Table Bay, South Africa when the East Asia Squadron was destroyed during the Battle of the Falklands in early December and she was ordered home on 8 December.Burt, p. 89 Upon her arrival, Minotaur became flagship of the 7th Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Arthur Waymouth,Corbett, II, pp. 413, 419 based at Cromarty Firth. She received a brief refit in early 1915 and was then assigned to Northern Patrol for the next year. The ship received a QF 12-pounder (three-inch) 12-cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF three-pounder (47 mm) AA gun in 1915‚Äì16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the three-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear. The ship was transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron on 30 May 1916 and participated in the Battle of Jutland on the following day as flagship of Rear Admiral Herbert Heath.Corbett, III, p. 426 She remained unengaged throughout the battle and did not fire her 9.2 or 7.5-inch guns at all during the battle.Campbell, p. 361 Minotaur was also present during the attempted interception of the High Seas Fleet by the Grand Fleet on 19 August although no combat occurred. For the rest of the war, the ship was assigned to the Northern Patrol.Newbolt, IV, pp. 42, 50, 192 On 11 December 1917, together with her sister and four destroyers, she was assigned to patrol the convoy route between Lerwick and Norway, but the Germans successfully destroyed a convoy off the Norwegian coast on the following day and returned home without being spotted. The British ships were only able to rescue survivors and escort the sole surviving ship from the convoy, the crippled destroyer , back to Scapa Flow.Newbolt, V, pp. 185, 192‚Äì93 In 1917‚Äì18 the 12-pounder AA gun mounted on the aft superstructure was moved to the roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret and a fire-control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the foremast. Minotaur was paid off on 5 February 1919, placed on the disposal list in May, put up for sale in March 1920 and sold the following month.

In August of that year, WRXW briefly stunted, making its listeners think the station was about to switch to classic rock, but in actuality, the only on-air change WRXW had made, under orders from Inner City, was dropping the Dallas-based, nationally syndicated morning show, Lex and Terry, which was replaced with The Morning Wood, a \\"live and local\\" morning show featuring program director Brad Stevens and Mandy Scott. Several on air staff changes were also made: Mandy Scott hosted middays, Joe Knight in afternoons, and Moose at night. Since then, the sale/LMA to Inner City fell through, and WRXW moved back to its original mobile home studio in a field under control of Backyard Broadcasting and subsequently started cleaning house due to money troubles.

Controversy On the September 17, 2010 edition of the show, Michael Catherwood, a radio host for Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM and co-host of the syndicated radio show Loveline who frequently substituted for Sal Masekela in recent months, made a controversial remark alluding to prison rape about openly gay singer and former American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert during a story about a physical altercation that Lambert allegedly had with a paparazzo earlier that week. Catherwood said \\"From what I know about jail, Mr. Lambert probably wouldn‚Äôt have too bad a time.\\" Catherwood later apologized on his Twitter account, insisting it was merely an attempted joke insinuating that Lambert would enjoy being in jail, because he would be in an all-male environment; after backlash from Lambert himself, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and many viewers, the show issued an on-air apology the following Monday. The series was cancelled four days later, with Masekela blaming Catherwood directly for its cancellation.

Fixed fire monitor at a plastic manufacturing factory A deluge gun, fire monitor, master stream or deck gun is an aimable controllable high-capacity water jet used for manual firefighting or automatic fire protection systems. Deluge guns are often designed to accommodate foam which has been injected in the upstream piping.  Background  A Great River Fire Department Engine demonstrating its deluge gun. The Boston fireboat Firefighter shows off its fire monitors. The term monitor may be derived from the class of warships known by the same name, that were armed with disproportionately large guns. Installation Deluge guns are often fitted to fire boats, tug boats, and on top of large fire trucks for use in manual firefighting efforts, where they can be aimed and operated by one firefighter and are used to deliver water or foam from outside the immediate area of the fire. Deluge guns are sometimes installed in fixed fire protection systems to protect high hazards, such as aviation hangars and helicopter landing pads. Similarly, facilities with highly flammable material such as oil refineries may have permanently installed deluge guns. Most apparatus-mounted deluge guns can be directed by a single firefighter, compared to a standard fire hose which normally requires several. Deluge guns can be automatically positioned for fixed systems, or may have portable designs. The latter option enables a firefighter to set up the gun to apply water to a blaze, before leaving it in place to attend to other tasks. Capacity  A deluge gun can discharge 2,000 US gallons (7,600 liters) per minute, or more. A master stream is a fire service term for a water stream of 350 US gallons (1,300 liters) per minute or greater. It is delivered by a master stream device, such as a deck gun, deluge gun, or fire monitor. Master streams are often found at the end of aerial ladders, tele- squirt nozzles, or monitor nozzles. The high pressure that they require renders them unsuitable for handline use. Risks A master stream brings with it many risks when used in an urban setting. A master stream should never be fired into a building with people inside, as the force could knock down a supporting wall in a structure and crush victims. Also, the steam resulting from the high volume of water delivered could cause a blowout or displace oxygen from an enclosed area, creating a risk of asphyxiation.

It was available in some of the jurisdictions that sell MUSL's most popular game, Powerball; membership fluctuated during the period when it was available. It began in September 1996 and was discontinued in March 1998. The game was drawn daily, including Sundays. Players paid US$1 for each game, which consisted of six numbers. Two numbers each were drawn from three colored number fields, each numbered from 1 through 21. The balls were dyed in the shades of the American flag; red, white, and blue, and drawn from three drum hoppers. Players won by matching at least two of the six numbers, regardless of which color drum(s) the matching balls came from. Matching all six won $1 million, which was cash, rather than annuitized. The name \\"Daily Millions\\" was chosen since MUSL believed the game would be popular enough for the association to award, on average, at least one $1 million prize per drawing. Top prize winners, however, were unexpectedly rare. The game jokingly became known as \\"Daily Miracle\\", perhaps because it survived as long as it did. In June 2002, Kansas and Nebraska started 2by2, which is played much like Daily Millions was, except players choose from two sets of 26 numbers each (red and white; the same colors as in Powerball.)

This operation opened a new front in northern Iraq/Iraqi Kurdistan also known as \\"the Northern Front\\". Despite Turkish help, this region was Iraq's weak point during the war as the Kurds sided with Iran.The First Gulf War (Iran and Iraq at War in the 1980s) Prelude In the year leading up to the operation, fighting between Iraqi and Iranian forces drew to a stalemate on the southern front. Iranian forces repeatedly used human wave attacks in the southern marshlands and deserts, only to be repulsed by forces of the Iraqi Third Corps. However, the Iranian government managed to win favor of the Kurdish people in parts of northern Iraq, thus allowing the opportunity to take the war north. The main objective of the mission was the frontier town of Haj Omran, which was nestled on the border and surrounded by mountainous terrain. Rebels of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq would prove a great asset to the advancing Iranians, given their knowledge of the terrain and the people. The battle On July 22, Iranian forces advanced from Piranshahr and were highly successful against the Iraqis, effectively seizing Haj Omran in the process. The Iranians and Kurdish guerrillas made use of elevated ridges to launch ambushes on Iraqi positions and convoys. In all, they seized roughly of Iraqi territory. Iraq responded with counteroffensive, launching an airborne assault and employing the use of poison gas for the first time in the entire war. The Iraqis hit Iranian troops on mountain tops near Haj Omran with mustard gas while their troops advanced in the slopes. The Iraqis were unfamiliar with the properties of poison gas and the agent descended back down to the exposed Iraqi troops. At the same time, the rugged terrain held up Iraqi tanks. The use of helicopter gunships was also hampered, since the Iranian and Kurdish fighters had better cover. These were the deciding factors that contributed to Iraq's loss of the battle.

Details Announced in March 2007 to succeed the E-500, it represents the first use of the new Panasonic MOS sensors instead of the Kodak CCD sensors that Olympus had used previously. It also is the first Olympus DSLR to include in-body image stabilization; most subsequent E-system cameras include an IS system. The E-510 body and lens mount conform to the \\"Four Thirds System\\" standard, providing compatibility with other lenses for that system. Four-Thirds is a digital SLR standard using a crop factor of 2x; this means that Four-Thirds lenses can be made smaller and cheaper, but that the cameras exhibit somewhat worse high ISO performance. As with all E-system cameras, the E-510 uses Olympus' Supersonic Wave Filter dust reduction system to shake dust from the sensor during startup and when requested by the user; this largely eliminates the problem of dust accumulation on the surface of the image sensor. The E-510 was released in a number of different iterations for purchase: the camera body only, the body bundled with a 14-42mm 1:3.5-5.6 lens, and the body bundled with 14-42mm 1:3.5-5.6 and 40-150mm 1:4-5.6 lenses. Note that, as Four-Thirds has a crop factor of 2x, the 35mm equivalent focal length of these lenses is twice the actual focal length. In the second quarter of 2008, the E-510's successor, the E-520, was released with minor updates to the Live View system, wireless flash capability, and a claimed improved metering system.

He is best known for his work with WCCW, PNW and AWA and for being one half of the tag team American Force with Paul Diamond in Texas All-Star Wrestling. He and his brother, wrestler Kelly Kiniski, are the sons of former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski. Career Nick Kiniski started wrestling in 1980. He was trained by his father, the legendary \\"Canada's Greatest Athlete\\" Gene Kiniski. He wrestled four years on the Canadian National Team and he was an alternate on the 1984 Canadian Olympic Team. His pro debut took place in the Oklahoma area on January 22, 1985, when he lost to Buck Zumhofe by disqualification when Nick's brother, Kelly Kiniski, interfered. =Texas-All Star Wrestling (1985-1986)= He first rose to fame in Fred Barend's Texas All-Star Wrestling. He formed a tag team with Paul Diamond called American Breed. Neither Diamond nor Kiniski were actually American; Diamond was Croatian/Canadian and Kiniski was Canadian, so the team name is quite ironic. The team won the TASW Tag Team Championship from the Maoris (Tudui & Wakahi) on May 25, 1985 and held them until Al Madril and Chavo Guerrero took the titles from them on June 5, 1985. The TASW Tag Team title was vacated later that same month when Chavo Guerrero refused to wrestle in a rematch against Diamond and Kiniski because Chavo‚Äôs father Gory Guerrero was the special referee chosen for the match. Madril teamed up with Black Gorman instead but lost the match. After the match Madril attacked Chavo Guerrero, splitting the team and forcing the titles to be held up. When Chavo later won the rights to name a new championship partner after defeating Madril in a singles match, he chose to give the titles to the American Breed instead, only now the American Breed consisted of Paul Diamond and a rookie named Shawn Michaels. After the formation of the Diamond/Michaels version of American Force, Kiniski left the company in 1986. =Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1986)= Kiniski joined Portland, Oregon-based Don Owen's Pacific Northwest Wrestling in 1986. He debuted at the PNW Superstars Extravaganza supershow, where he defeated Timothy Flowers by disqualification. He started feuding with Rip Oliver for the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship but the feud was unsuccessful for Kiniski. He also had a short-lived feud with Danny Collins before leaving PNW. =World Wrestling Federation(1986)= Kiniski wrestled a few times for the WWF at their frequent Madison Square Garden shows as well as at the Boston Garden, including wins over Steve Lombardi (aka Brooklyn Brawler), Frenchy Martin, Jimmy Jack Funk and Les Thornton in late 1986/early1987.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/80smsg.htm He was featured on WWF's television shows at least once - including a very competitive match against current WWF Intercontinental Champion Randy Savage which he only narrowly lost, on the December 27th 1986 edition of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. =American Wrestling Association (1986-1987)= Kiniski joined American Wrestling Association in late 1986. He formed a heel tag team with Kevin Kelly called The Perfect Tag Team to contend for the AWA World Tag Team Championship. He and Kelly had actually started wrestling together in the WWF. The duo was managed by Sherri Martel. Martel left the AWA in July 1987 and was replaced by Madusa Miceli as the team's manager. They eventually pursued singles careers as Kiniski left the team. =World Class Championship Wrestling (1987-1990)= The last promotion where Kiniski wrestled was World Class Championship Wrestling. He started his WCCW stint in 1987 and feuded with the Von Erichs. He used to wrestle Kevin and Kerry for most of his matches but he had few victories over Kevin and Kerry. He retired from professional wrestling when the promotion closed in 1990 and merged with United States Wrestling Association. After Retirement After retiring, Kiniski moved to the small town of Point Roberts located within an American exclave along the Canada-America border. He opened a bar, named Kiniski's reef, and later became a chief in the towns fire department.

Before the First World War, she served with the Home Fleet, generally as the flagship of a cruiser squadron. The ship remained with the Grand Fleet, as the Home Fleet was renamed when the war began, for the entire war, but only participated in a single battle, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Shannon spent most of the war unsuccessfully patrolling the North Sea for German warships and commerce raiders. She was paid off in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1922. Description Shannon displaced as built and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a mean draught of . Her beam was wider and her draught one foot less than her sisters in the belief that she would prove to be the fastest ship in the class. Shannon was powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by 24 Yarrow water-tube boilers. The engines were designed to reach a total of and were intended to give a maximum speed of . Shannon proved to be the slowest ship in the class; during her sea trials on 3 December 1907 her engines reached , but she only reached a speed of The ship carried a maximum of of coal and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, she could steam for at a speed of . Shannon was designed to carry 779 officers and enlisted men, but had a complement of 819 in 1908 and 842 in 1912.Burt, pp. 86, 93‚Äì95. The ship's main armament consisted of four BL 9.2-inch Mark X guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft. Her secondary armament of ten BL 7.5-inch Mark II guns were mounted amidships in single turrets. Anti- torpedo boat defence was provided by sixteen QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 18-cwt guns.\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 18 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. Shannon also mounted five submerged 17.7-inch torpedo tubes, one of which was mounted in the stern.Burt, p. 94. The waterline armour belt consisted of of Krupp cemented armour roughly between the fore and aft 7.5-inch gun turrets, but was reduced in steps to three inches to the ends of the ship. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour. The thickness of the lower deck was . The armour of the conning tower was thick.Burt, p. 86. Construction and career funnels were lengthened. Shannon was ordered as part of the 1904‚Äì05 naval construction programme as one of the three Minotaur-class armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 2 January 1905 at Chatham Dockyard. The ship was christened on 27 April 1907 by Lady Carrington and commissioned on 19 March 1908Burt, p. 92. at the cost of ¬£1,415,135.Parkes, p. 447. While fitting out in Portsmouth, Shannon was accidentally struck on 5 December 1907 by the battleship which had broken loose from her anchorage; both ships were only lightly damaged. Upon commissioning, the ship became the flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron of Home Fleet and was later transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron as a private ship when the fleet reorganized in April 1909. She became the flagship of her squadron on 1 March 1910 and made a port visit to Torbay in January 1911. Shannon was relieved as flagship by the battlecruiser on 5 March 1912 and was transferred to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron as that squadron's flagship. In January 1914, she relieved Indomitable as flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron during exercises off the northwest coast of Spain. The following month, Shannon, together with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and the rest of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, made a port visit to Brest, France. In October 1914, the ship was patrolling off the coast of Norway and almost intercepted the armed merchant cruiser on several occasions. During a sweep into the Heligoland Bight on 26 November, she was unsuccessfully bombed by a German aircraft. She began a refit shortly afterwards that lasted until 24 January 1915. Shannon was present in Cromarty Firth when the armoured cruiser 's magazine exploded on 30 December 1915 and her crew attempted to rescue survivors from Natal.Hampshire, p. 105. The ship received a QF 12-pounder (three-inch) 12-cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47 mm) AA gun in 1915‚Äì16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on the aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck at the extreme rear. Sometime afterwards, a fire-control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the foremast.Burt, pp. 87, 92. During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, she was on the unengaged side of the fleet and did not fire her 9.2 or 7.5-inch guns at all during the battle.Campbell, p. 361. The ship spent several days after the battle searching for survivors from her sister and other sunken ships. Before the end of the war the 12-pounder AA gun mounted on the aft superstructure was moved to the roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret. Shannon was paid off on 2 May 1919Burt, pp. 87, 93. and became an accommodation ship until sold for breaking up on 12 December 1922.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 10, 13.

Sulukan normally refers to mood setting songs by a puppeteer (dhalang) in Javanese wayang (\\"puppet\\") performances in Indonesia. The term can also refer to the pathetan pieces played before and after gamelan pieces in a non-wayang context,Brinner 1985 and to mystical poetry relating to the doctrinal meaning of the term sulook.Zoetmulder 1935; Soesanto Darnawi 1982 Etymology The etymology of the term is unclear. Arps relates it to the gamelan practice of c√™luk (\\"calling out\\"), an introduction to a piece with a sung phrase, rather than an instrumental introduction.Arps (1992) It is also possible that the word derives from the Sanskrit term sloka, a verse form consisting of octosyllabic couplets. This is plausible considering that the metrical structure of sulukan verses does indeed generally conform to the pattern of octosyllabic couplets, the etymology may have passed into Javanese lore from the work of 19th century Dutch scholars. This verse form is in sharp contrast to the normal metres of Javanese poetry. Sulukan which follow the normal Javanese metres are specified as such in their titles, e.g. Kawin Sekar Sinom,Mudjanattistomo 1977 which follows the sekar (macapat verse form) named sinom. If no specification is made, the text will be in octosyllabic couplets - either w√™tah (a number of complete couplets), jugag (in couplets but with a truncated final line) or c√™kak (a single complete couplet). Forms The Yogyakarta and Surakarta traditions of wayang each have their own repertory of sulukan. The standard Yogyakarta listing is contained in Mudjanattistomo's Pedhalangan Ngayogyakarta (1977), and divides the repertory into the following categories: lagon, (equivalent to pathetan in the Surakarta style), kawin, sendhon, suluk, bawaswara and ada-ada. Lagon, kawin and suluk are used to introduce whole scenes, while sendhon and ada-ada are used to introduce particular types of action within a scene, and bawaswara are used as introductions to specific gamelan pieces. The Surakarta tradition is covered by Nojowirongko's Serat tuntunan padalangan (1954), which also forms the foundation of the account of sulukan in English given by Brandon. In the Surakarta tradition, only pathetan, sendhon and ada-ada are recognised as forms. A further distinction between types is between those accompanied by a small group an instruments including gend√©r, gambang, rebab and suling (such as lagon and suluk), and those accompanied by gender alone or with the addition of kempuls and gongs (such as kawin, sendhon and ada-ada). Naming conventions All sulukan have a specific pathet designation relating both to the mode of the gamelan and the act of the wayang performance, many also have a functional specification relating to their role in the drama, which either specifies the scene in which they are used or their particular occasion. For example: Lagon Sl 9 w√™tah tumrap badhe gara-gara - in this title Lagon is the type, Sl 9 specifies the mode as being slendro sanga, w√™tah indicates the metre, and tumrap badhe gara-gara indicates its use at the opening of the gara-gara section which introduces the clowns (punokawan). Sulukan texts The language of most sulukan in current use is not everyday Javanese. Instead it is a mixture of high Javanese (krama), literary Javanese and Kawi. The literary Javanese used in sulukan and many other literary forms differsm from spoken Javanese in three main ways: Firstly, the grammatical rules covering elements such as word order are relaxed - a practice known as baliswara;Robson (1990) secondly, a large number of archaic words or phrases are used to create an atmosphere of \\"ancient wisdom\\", and finally the normal rules on speech levels (undha-usuk') may be relaxed, allowing the poet to choose a ngoko, krama, krama inggil or even Kawi version of a word to fit the metre in use, creating juxtapositions of speech levels unthinkable in normal discourse. Most modern Javanese wayang audiences do not \\"understand\\" the texts of sulukan in the normal sense - although there are differences in levels of comprehension as there would be for an English-speaking audience at a Shakespeare play, for instance - but few see it as a problem, feeling that the archaic and obscurantist nature of the texts is appropriate to the atmosphere of \\"otherworldliness\\" which wayang tries to create. In any case, Javanese dalangs are clear that the function of sulukan is to set a mood rather than convey information. Dramaturgical function Of the 55 sulukan listed in Mudjanattistomo,Mudjanattistomo (1977) 50 are specified as having a particular scene-setting function. These are always indicated in the title by the Javanese word tumrap (\\"for\\"), and fall into five broad categories: sulukan used to introduce a scene, sulukan used to introduce a named character or generic character-type, sulukan presented as being sung by one of the punokawan, sulukan used within a scene to introduce a type of action - usually but not always a fight sequence, and sulukan attached to a specific gamelan piece by way of a vocal introduction.

It is owned and operated by the Luftseilbahn Wengen‚ÄìM√§nnlichen AG. History In 1949, a number of concerned individuals from the resort of Wengen got together and founded a committee to provide a link between the resort and ski and hiking region of the M√§nnlichen. Building began in 1953 and the cableway was opened on 22 July 1954. The estimated CHF 1.59 million building costs were overrun by about 4%. As built, the cableway had two cabins each of which carried 40 people. These were replaced in 1963 by cabins for 50 persons, at the same time as the valley station was extended. In 1973, the drive motor was replaced. In 1992 and 1993, the cableway, with the exception of the stations, was completely renovated at a cost of around CHF 8.7 million. Two new 80 person cabins were put into service, and journey time was reduced from 6‚Äì7 minutes to 4‚Äì5 minutes. During the night of 22/23 February 1999, an avalanche buried the lower station under more than of debris. As a consequence the cableway was shut for several months, and the canton of Bern decided that operation could not resume from the old location. Instead it was decided to rebuild the station outside the avalanche zone and close to the main street of Wengen. Operation resumed by the end of year. For 2017 the service generated CHF 3,000,000 of income and a profit of CHF 86,000, with 218,315 passengers in the winter season, and 122,708 in the summer. In 2018 the cars were replaced. The new cars included a detachable balcony offering an outside ride, named the Royal Ride, available to passengers for a CHF 5 supplement. Operations The current cable car was built by Garaventa AG, and has a horizontal length of . The height difference is with an average gradient of 70.8% and a maximum gradient of 96.9%. The cars operate at a speed of , which gives a travel time of 5 minutes and a transport capacity of 860 persons per hour.

Around 180,000 Iranian troops participated in this offensive, which targeted the central front in the region of Mehran. However, withering Iraqi firepower in support of deeply entrenched troops slaughtered the advancing Iranians. Although Iranian troops were highly motivated, they were poorly trained and equipped for this battle. For Iran, the operation was a disaster. The Iraqis struck back by emerging from their trenches to counterattack into Iran and capture Mehran, for the second time.  Background  The Operation Dawn 3 is part of the series of Dawn operations, which involved about 500,000 troops covering a 150-mile front. It was launched in February 1983 and was described by Speaker Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as the final move towards ending the Iran-Iraq war. The first campaign was concentrated in the Hawizeh marsh area and in the Haj Omran during the Operation Dawn 2. These achieved only minimal gains and started to diminish the morale of the Iranian troops as well as the Iranian reputation. The Iranians began a new attack in July 1983 in the central (Zurbatiya) sector. Battle The Iranians attempted to further exploit activities in the north after Operation Dawn 2 on 30 July 1983. Iran saw an opportunity to sweep away Iraqi forces controlling the roads between the Iranian controlled mountain border towns of Mehran, Dehloran and Elam. Iraq conducted airstrikes against 50,000 Iranian forces lodged in mountainous terrain, exhausting themselves attempting to dislodge the Iranians. Realising they needed to alter their tactics, Iraq equipped attack helicopters with chemical warheads; while ineffective, it demonstrated both the Iraqi general staff's and Saddam's increasing interest in using chemical weapons. In the end, in total 17,000 soldiers had lost their lives,[clarification needed] with no gain for either country.[73]  References  * Iran Chamber Society (www.iranchamber.com) * geocities Category:Military operations of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1983 Category:Battles involving Iran Category:Battles involving Iraq Category:1983 in Iran ","title":"Operation Dawn 3"},{"id":"11850261","text":"Belle Plain is a ghost town in Callahan County, Texas, United States. History In 1875, a man named Nelson M. Smith purchased land on which he planned to build a college. He platted a townsite to accompany the new school, and though the origin of the town's unusual name is not completely clear, it has long been speculated that it was named after Katie Belle Magee, the first child born at the new town site. By the following year, the town had three businesses and an estimated population of about 65 residents. When Callahan County was organized in 1877, voters chose Belle Plain as the seat of government. The town's first newspaper was established in 1879, and by the mid-1880s Belle Plain had become a center of commerce and industry for the county with several businesses, Smith's small Belle Plain College, and a population of around 400. As was with many towns on the Texas frontier in the 19th century, Belle Plain was doomed when it was bypassed by rail construction. Both town and college suffered, and as a result, experienced simultaneous and rapid decline. In 1883 the county seat was moved to nearby Baird; even the stone jailhouse was disassembled, transported in pieces, and re-assembled at its current location in Baird. Belle Plain College struggled along for a few more years, finally closing in 1892. By then, the town was essentially abandoned, and the last remaining citizens had left Belle Plain by the time its post office was deactivated in 1907. Today, little remains of Belle Plain. The crumbling main building of the college, and a few ruined structures and foundations are all that is left to mark the spot where the town once stood. With the exception of the cemetery, Belle Plain's remnants now sit on private property.

Her career also included radio where she appeared on \\"Chevrolet Musical Moments Revue\\" in 1937. Miss Antoine was a regular star on NBC Radio's \\"The Carnation Contented Hour\\" (\\"The Melody Hour,\\" without commercials, at Armed Forces Radio Service) with Percy Faith during World War II. Miss Antoine was a favorite at Chautauqua Institution, New York where she had been soloist for many seasons. Hence she was affectionately known as \\"Chautauqua's Sweetheart.\\"  Early life  Josephine Louise Antoine was born in Denver, Colorado, on October 27, 1907. She was adopted while still a baby by Mr. and Mrs. Arthur H. By 1914, her foster family had moved to Boulder.  Training  In 1921, Antoine began studying voice with Alexander Grant, a faculty member at the University of Colorado, and continued with him until she graduated from the University of Colorado with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929. That same year she won the Atwater Kent Audition Contest which provided her with scholarship money and the opportunity to go to the east coast to study vocal music. She also received the first Master of Music degree ever granted by University of Colorado. In 1930-31 she studied at Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and from 1931 to 1934 studied at Juilliard in New York City. She trained under the legendary Marcella Sembrich at Curtis and Juilliard, with whom she was often compared. Her voice was remarkable for its bell-like quality in the high register as well as its warmth and power throughout the entire vocal range. Arthur Bodansky conductor at the Metropolitan Opera heard her sing in a student performance of Strauss' \\"Ariadne Auf Naxos\\" and arranged an audition with Giulio Gatti-Casazza, General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera.  Operatic career  In 1935 Josephine Antoine signed with the Met and subsequently she made her debut in 1936 as Philine in \\"Mignon\\", broadcast on January 4, 1936. Her career with the Met lasted through February 28, 1948. During this period she also sang for other opera companies including the Chicago Opera, the San Francisco Opera, the Cincinnati Opera and the Chautauqua Opera.  Concert career  Josephine Antoine was an internationally known artist. She toured throughout the United States, Canada, Newfoundland and Puerto Rico appearing as soloist with orchestras in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Worcester, Massachusetts, Washington, D. C., and the southwest (The Chautauquan Daily; August 18, 1962). The peak of her touring occurred during the 1938‚Äì1940 seasons when Miss Antoine appeared on stages of the Allied Arts Events at Oklahoma State University (1939), the Santa Fe Concert Association (1939‚Äì40), the Sarasota Concert Association (1938‚Äì39), and the Wisconsin Union Theater (1938‚Äì39), in addition to her responsibilities at the Metropolitan Opera.  Radio career  Outside of incidental occasions such as with Bing Crosby on KPO, October 22, 1936, Miss Antoine appeared for some years on \\"The Carnation Contented Hour\\" radio program. According to Frank Buxton and Bill Owen's \\"The Big Broadcast 1920‚Äì1950\\", (1972), the Carnation Contented Hour was a long-running music program sponsored by the Carnation Milk Company. It first appeared on NBC in 1931. The music theme was \\"Contented.\\" The program was a variety show originating from Chicago featuring Percy Faith and his orchestra (1940‚Äì1947). During the Antoine era key personnel included the orchestra, the Carnation Contented Chorus, Ralph Nyland, tenor; Reinhold Schmidt, bass; and Josephine Antoine, soprano. The announcer was Vincent Pelletier. Producers were Harry K. Gilman and C. H. Cottington. During World War II, the Armed Forces Radio Service obtained rights to rebroadcast the program for the entertainment of military personnel. Commercial messages were edited out and the program was re-titled \\"The Melody Hour.\\" It was a 30-minute show. Recordings were made on 16\\" electrical transcription discs for play back at 33 rpm over AFRS according to their schedules. Jay Hickerson's compendium \\"The Ultimate History of Network Radio Programming and Guide to all Circulating Shows\\" (1992) indicates that during this era, the program was on NBC at 8:00 p. m. from October 31, 1932, and as of November 21, 1932, until September 26, 1949, then moved to 10:00 p. m. He reports that there are 43 recorded shows available, 36 bearing dates.  Teaching career  After a successful opera career Miss Antoine taught at Indiana University (1947‚Äì48), University of Colorado (1948‚Äì49), Los Angeles Conservatory of Music (1950‚Äì53), University of Texas (1953‚Äì57), Arizona State University (1959‚Äì66), and at Eastman School of Music (1957‚Äì59, and 1966‚Äì71). She made her home in Rochester, New York, since 1966 and taught voice at Chautauqua Summer Schools.  Colorado life  Miss Antoine sang concerts at Denver Auditorium in 1936 and 1945. She starred in \\"The Bartered Bride\\", Central City, 1940, and in \\"The Red Mill\\" for the Denver Post Opera, 1949. In 1948 she sang for the Colorado Memorial Center fund. Josephine Antoine was married to Edward Hinkle, program director at a radio station in Boulder. Their daughter Myra was born in 1949.  Chautauqua life  Josephine Antoine made her debut with the Chautauqua Opera Association in 1933 in the title role of \\"Martha.\\" That summer she also appeared for the first time with the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra. In the traditions of Chautauqua her name is linked to \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\", a song with which she closed her appearances in the Amphitheater. In neighboring Jamestown, New York, she appeared as soloist for the Mozart Club and the Jamestown Civic Orchestra.  Death  On October 30, 1971, Josephine Antoine died of heart failure, aged 64, in Jamestown, New York, the day after her daughter, Myra Louise, was married. At the time of her death she was a professor of voice at the Eastman School of Music.

By directing the same type of beam downwards, the depth to the bottom of the ocean could be calculated.Garrison, Tom. Essentials of Oceanography. 6th ed. Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks Cole, 2012. p.79. The first practical deep-ocean echo sounder was invented by Harvey C. Hayes, a U.S. Navy physicist. For the first time, it was possible to create a quasi-continuous profile of the ocean floor along the course of a ship. The first such profile was made by Hayes on board the U.S.S. Stewart, a Navy destroyer that sailed from Newport to Gibraltar between June 22 and 29, 1922. During that week, 900 deep-ocean soundings were made.Kunzig, Robert. Mapping the Deep: The Extraordinary Story of Ocean Science. New York: Norton 2000. p. 40-41. Using a refined echo sounder, the German survey ship Meteor made several passes across the South Atlantic from the equator to Antarctica between 1925 and 1927, taking soundings every 5 to 20 miles. Their work created the first detailed map of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It showed that the Ridge was a rugged mountain range, and not the smooth plateau that some scientists had envisioned. Since that time, both naval and research vessels have operated echo sounders almost continuously while at sea.Stewart, Robert. Introduction to Physical Oceanography, University Press of Florida, 2009 p. 28. Important contributions to acoustical oceanography have been made by: * Leonid Brekhovskikh * Walter Munk * Herman Medwin * John L. Spiesberger * C.C. Leroy * David E. Weston * D. Van Holliday * Charles Greenlaw Equipment used The earliest and most widespread use of sound and sonar technology to study the properties of the sea is the use of a rainbow echo sounder to measure water depth. Sounders were the devices used that mapped the many miles of the Santa Barbara Harbor ocean floor until 1993. Fathometers measure the depth of the waters. It works by electronically sending sounds from ships, therefore also receiving the sound waves that bounces back from the bottom of the ocean. A paper chart moves through the fathometer and is calibrated to record the depth. As technology advances, the development of high resolution sonars in the second half of the 20th century made it possible to not just detect underwater objects but to classify them and even image them. Electronic sensors are now attached to ROVs since nowadays, ships or robot submarines have Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). There are cameras attached to these devices giving out accurate images. The oceanographers are able to get a clear and precise quality of pictures. The 'pictures' can also be sent from sonars by having sound reflected off ocean surroundings. Oftentimes sound waves reflect off animals, giving information which can be documented into deeper animal behaviour studies. Theory See Clay and Medwin.C. S. Clay & H.

Alternative Christian views on the origin of souls are traducianism and also the idea of a pre-existence of the soul. The Scholastic philosophers held the theory of Creationism. Concept Creationism holds that the origin of the soul cannot be by spiritual generation from the souls of parents (as the German theologian Jakob Frohschammer (1821-1893) maintained) because human souls, being essentially and integrally simple and indivisible, can give forth no spiritual germs or reproductive elements. The creation of the soul by the First Cause, when second causes have posited the pertinent conditions, falls within the order of nature; it is a so-called \\"law of nature\\", not an interference therewith.Siegfried, Francis. \\"Creationism.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 February 2019 As regards the time when the individual soul is created, philosophical speculation varies. The traditional philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church holds that the rational soul is created at the moment when it is infused into the new organism. Thomas Aquinas, following Aristotle's embryology, taught that rational soul is created when the antecedent principles of life have rendered the foetus an appropriate organism for rational life, though some time is required after birth before the sensory organs are sufficiently developed to assist in the functions of intelligence. On the other hand, most neo-Scholastics hold that the rational soul is created and infused into the incipient human being at the moment of conception. History Augustine of Hippo was undecided between creationism and traducianism, while Jerome condemned traducianism and held that creationism was the opinion of the Church. Augustine attempted to reconcile the statement in Genesis 2:2 \\"On the seventh day God completed the work he had been doing; he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had undertaken,\\" with Jerome's citation of John 5:17, \\"‚ÄúMy Father is at work until now, so I am at work,‚Äù > if, I say, ‚Ä¶ we affirm that for each individual He creates separately a new > soul when he is born, we do not herein affirm that He makes anything which > he had not already made. For He had already made man after His own image on > the sixth day; and this work of His is unquestionably to be understood with > reference to the rational soul of man. The same work He still does, not in > creating what did not exist, but in multiplying what already existed. > Wherefore it is true, on the one hand, that He rested from creating things > which previously did not exist, and equally true, on the other hand, that He > continues still to work, not only in governing what He has made, but also in > making (not anything which did not previously exist, but) a larger number of > those creatures which He had already made. Wherefore, either by such an > explanation, or by any other which may seem better, we escape from the > objection advanced by those who would make the fact that God rested from His > works a conclusive argument against our believing that new souls are still > being daily created, not from the first soul, but in the same manner as it > was made.\\"From Augustine to Jerome, on the origin of the soul (A.D. 415)\\", > Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, First Series, Vol. 1. (Philip Schaff, ed.), > Buffalo, New York: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1887.) Philo and some rabbis insisted that God‚Äôs providence remains active, keeping all things in existence, giving life in birth and taking it away in death. Other rabbis taught that God rested from creating, but not from judging, ruling, or governing. Creationism, which had always prevailed in Eastern Christianity, became the general opinion of the medieval theologians. Amongst the Scholastics there were no defenders of Traducianism. Hugh of Saint Victor and Alexander of Hales alone characterize Creationism as the more probable opinion; all the other Schoolmen hold it as certain. Peter Lombard's creando infundit animas Deus et infundendo creat (\\"in creating, God pours in the soul, and in pouring, He creates\\") was an accepted formula. Martin Luther, like Augustine, was undecided, but Lutherans have as a rule been traducianists. John Calvin favoured creationism. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz argued that Creationism guards the dignity and spirituality of the rational soul, and is the proper seat of the image of God.McClintock, John and Strong, James. \\"Creationism\\", Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Vol. 2, Harper, 1894 Hermann Lotze, however, who may be taken as representing the believers in the immanence of the divine Being, puts forth ‚Äì but as a \\"dim conjecture\\" ‚Äì something very like creationism. This view is generally held by the contemporary magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church, most notably in the instruction Dignitas Personae. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, 366, states that \\"The Church teaches that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God‚Äî it is not 'produced' by the parents‚Ä¶.\\" References Category:Christian anthropology Category:Christian terminology ","title":"Creationism (soul)"},{"id":"11850406","text":"View to the valley, in the background Wetterhorn and Schreckhorn View towards the summit Near Grindelwald Grund in summer A view from the gondola in winter The Grindelwald‚ÄìM√§nnlichen gondola cableway () is a gondola cableway linking Grindelwald with M√§nnlichen.

Writing therapy posits that writing one's feelings gradually eases feelings of emotional trauma. Writing therapeutically can take place individually or in a group and it can be administered in person with a therapist or remotely through mailing or the Internet. The field of writing therapy includes many practitioners in a variety of settings. The therapy is usually administered by a therapist or counselor. Several interventions exist online. Writing group leaders also work in hospitals with patients dealing with mental and physical illnesses. In university departments they aid student self-awareness and self-development. When administered at a distance, it is useful for those who prefer to remain personally anonymous and are not ready to disclose their most private thoughts and anxieties in a face-to-face situation. As with most forms of therapy, writing therapy is adapted and used to work with a wide range of psychoneurotic illnesses, including bereavement, desertion and abuse. Many of these interventions take the form of classes where clients write on specific themes chosen by their therapist or counsellor. Assignments may include writing unsent letters to selected individuals, alive or dead, followed by imagined replies from the recipient or parts of the patient's body, or a dialogue with the recovering alcoholic's bottle of alcohol. Research into the therapeutic action of writing = The expressive writing paradigm = Expressive writing is a form of writing therapy developed primarily by James W. Pennebaker in the late 1980s. The seminal expressive writing study instructed participants in the experimental group to write about a 'past trauma', expressing their very deepest thoughts and feelings surrounding it. In contrast, control participants were asked to write as objectively and factually as possible about neutral topics (e.g. a particular room or their plans for the day), without revealing their emotions or opinions. For both groups, the timescale was 15 minutes of continuous writing repeated over four consecutive days. It was also instructed that should a participant run out of things to write, they should go back to the beginning and repeat themselves, perhaps writing a little differently. Typical writing instructions include: > For the next 4 days, I would like you to write your very deepest thoughts > and feelings about the most traumatic experience of your entire life or an > extremely important emotional issue that has affected you and your life. In > your writing, I'd like you to really let go and explore your deepest > emotions and thoughts. You might tie your topic to your relationships with > others, including parents, lovers, friends or relatives; to your past, your > present or your future; or to who you have been, who you would like to be or > who you are now. You may write about the same general issues or experiences > on all days of writing or about different topics each day. All of your > writing will be completely confidential. > > Don't worry about spelling, grammar or sentence structure. The only rule is > that once you begin writing, you continue until the time is up. Several measurements were made before and after, but the most striking finding was that relative to the control group, the experimental group made significantly fewer visits to a physician in the following months. Although many report being upset by the writing experience, they also find it valuable and meaningful. Pennebaker has either written or co-written over 130 articles on expressive writing. One of these suggested that expressive writing has the potential to actually 'boost' the immune system, perhaps explaining the reduction in physician visits. This was shown by measuring lymphocyte response to the foreign mitogens phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (ConA) just prior to and 6 weeks after writing. The significantly increased lymphocyte response led to speculation that expressive writing enhances immunocompetence. The results of a preliminary study of 40 people diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder suggests that routinely engaging in expressive writing may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression.Krpan, Katherine, et. al. (2013). \\"An everyday activity as a treatment for depression:The benefits of expressive writing for people diagnosed with major depressive disorcer\\". Journal of Affective Disroders. 150. doi:https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2013.05.065 = Reception and criticism of Pennebaker's expressive writing theories = Pennebaker's experiments, begun over twenty years ago, have been widely replicated and validated. Following on from Pennebaker's original work, there has been a renewed interest in the therapeutic value of abreaction. This was first discussed by Josef Breuer and Freud in Studies on Hysteria but not much explored since. At the heart of Pennebaker's theory is the idea that actively inhibiting thoughts and feelings about traumatic events requires effort, serves as a cumulative stressor on the body, and is associated with increased physiological activity, obsessive thinking or ruminating about the event, and longer-term disease. However, as Baikie and Wilhelm note, the theory has intuitive appeal but mixed empirical support: > Studies have shown that expressive writing results in significant > improvements in various biochemical markers of physical and immune > functioning (Pennebaker et al, 1988; Esterling et al, 1994; Petrie et al, > 1995; Booth et al, 1997). This suggests that written disclosure may reduce > the physiological stress on the body caused by inhibition, although it does > not necessarily mean that disinhibition is the causal mechanism underlying > these biological effects. On the other hand, participants writing about > previously undisclosed traumas showed no differences in health outcomes from > those writing about previously disclosed traumas (Greenberg & Stone, 1992) > and participants writing about imaginary traumas that they had not actually > experienced, and therefore could not have inhibited, also demonstrated > significant improvements in physical health (Greenberg et al, 1996). > Therefore, although inhibition may play a part, the observed benefits of > writing are not entirely due to reductions in inhibition. In a 2013 article by Nazarian and Smyth , writing instructions for the expressive writing task were manipulated - in that 6 conditions were created - i.e., cognitive-processing, exposure, self-regulation, and benefit-finding, standard expressive writing and a control group. While salivary cortisol was measured for each condition, none of the conditions significantly influenced cortisol, but instructions did impact mood differentially depending on the condition. For example, the cognitive-processing as measured post-intervention were influenced not only by the cognitive processing instructions but also by exposure and benefit-finding. These results demonstrate a spillover effect from instructions to outcomes. In related research Travagin, Margola, Dennis and Revenson cognitive-processing instructions were compared to standard expressive writing for adolescents with peer problems and this research demonstrated better long-term social adjustment compared to standard expressive writing and greater increased positive affect for those adolescents who reported more peer problems than most. = Other theories related to writing therapy = An additional line of enquiry, which has particular bearing on the difference between talking and writing, derives from Robert Ornstein's studies into the bicameral structure of the brain. While noting that what follows should be considered \\"wildly hypothetical\\", L'Abate, quoting Ornstein, postulates that: > One could argue ... that talk and writing differ in relative cerebral > dominance. ... if language is more related to the right hemisphere, then > writing may be more related to the left hemisphere. If this is the case, > then writing might use or even stimulate parts of the brain that are not > stimulated by talking. Julie Gray, founder of Stories Without Borders notes that \\"People who have experienced trauma in their lives, whether or not they consider themselves writers, can benefit from creating narratives out of their stories. It is helpful to write it down, in other words, in safety and in non-judgment. Trauma can be quite isolating. Those who have suffered need to understand how they feel and also to try to communicate that to others.\\" The role of the distance therapies With the accessibility provided by the Internet, the reach of the writing therapies has increased considerably, as clients and therapists can work together from anywhere in the world, provided they can write the same language. They simply \\"enter\\" into a private \\"chat room\\" and engage in an ongoing text dialogue in \\"real time\\". Participants can also receive therapy sessions via e-text and/or voice with video, and complete online questionnaires, handouts, workout sheets and similar exercises.Harwood, T. Mark and L'Abate, Luciano. \\"Distance Writing: Helping without Seeing Participants.\\" Self-Help in Mental Health: A Critical Review. London: Springer, 2010. 47. This requires the services of a counsellor or therapist, albeit sitting at a computer. Given the huge disjunction between the amount of mental illness compared with the paucity of skilled resources, new ways have been sought to provide therapy other than drugs. In the more advanced societies pressure for cost-effective treatments, supported by evidence-based results, has come from both insurance companies and government agencies. Hence the decline in long term intensive psychoanalysis and the rise of much briefer forms, such as cognitive therapy. Via the Internet Currently, the most widely used mode of Internet writing therapy is via e-mail (see analytic psychotherapist Nathan Field's paper \\"The Therapeutic Action of Writing in Self-Disclosure and Self-Expression\\"). It is asynchronous; i.e. messages are passed between therapist and client within an agreed time frame (for instance, one week), but at any time within that week. Where both parties remain anonymous the client benefits from the online disinhibition effect; that is to say, feels freer to disclose memories, thoughts and feelings that they might withhold in a face-to-face situation. Both client and therapist have time for reflecting on the past and recapturing forgotten memories, time for privately processing their reactions and giving thought to their own responses. With e-therapy, space is eliminated and time expanded. Overall it considerably reduces the amount of therapeutic input, as well as the speed and pressure that therapists habitually have to work under. The anonymity and invisibility provides a therapeutic environment that comes much closer than classical analysis to Freud's ideal of the \\"analytic blank screen\\". Sitting behind the patient on the couch still leaves room for a multitude of clues to the analyst's individuality; e-therapy provides almost none. Whether distance and reciprocal anonymity reduces or increases the level of transference has yet to be investigated. In a 2016 randomised controlled trial, expressive writing was tested against direction to an online support group for individuals with anxiety and depression. No difference between the groups was found. Both groups showed a moderate improvement over time, but of a magnitude comparable to what one would expect to see over the time period concerned without intervention. Journaling The oldest and most widely practiced form of self-help through writing is that of keeping a personal journal or diary‚Äîas distinct from a diary or calendar of daily appointments‚Äîin which the writer records their most meaningful thoughts and feelings. One individual benefit is that the act of writing puts a powerful brake on the torment of endlessly repeating troubled thoughts to which everyone is prone. Moreover, as Kathleen Adams notes, through the act of journal writing, the writer is also able to \\"literally [read] his or her own mind\\" and thus \\"to perceive experiences more clearly and thus feels a relief of tension\\". Poetry Pulitzer Prize for Poetry finalist Bruce Weigl, a veteran of the Vietnam War, has discussed the therapeutic benefits of writing, especially when combined with other forms of therapy, for people coming to terms with traumatic experiences such as war. According to Weigl, \\"What it helps you do is externalize things, give a shape to it. And that's what Denise Levertov kept telling me is that, Look, you control it now. It doesn't control you anymore. You own it now.\\" See also *Self-concealment *Self-disclosure *Reflective writing Notes References  Category:Psychotherapy Category:Writing ","title":"Writing therapy"},{"id":"11850494","text":"The Sisters of Christian Charity (S.C.C.), officially called Sisters of Christian Charity, Daughters of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception,SCC Wilmette is a Roman Catholic papal congregation of consecrated Religious Sisters.

Their original mission was for the care of the blind. Today, their main mission is teaching in Catholic schools and healthcare. Unlike some Religious Sisters, Sisters of Christian Charity are required to wear a traditional religious habit. History The institute had attained great success throughout Germany when, in 1873, its members were forced into exile by the persecution of the Kulturkampf. Some went to South America, where there are now many flourishing communities. Others emigrated to New Orleans, United States, where, in April 1873, they founded a house and took charge of a parochial school.

All together, the cross has 12 points symbolizing the Apostles whose mission it was to spread the Gospel message throughout the world. The Coptic cross is widely used in the Coptic church and the Ethiopian and Eritrean churches. Many Copts have the cross tattooed as a sign of faith on the inside of their right arm at the wrist.

The tooth exhibits 50% bone loss, adding roughly 5-7 mm to the clinical crown of what is actually anatomical root. The fulcrum, existing somewhere immediately apical to the height of the bone, does not allow for any adjacent bone to avoid compression or tension, resulting in virtually complete widening of the PDL and a grim prognosis, due to secondary occlusal trauma. Crown-to-root-ratio is the ratio of the length of the part of a tooth that appears above the alveolar bone versus what lies below it.Page 114 in: It is an important consideration in the diagnosis, treatment planning and restoration of teeth, one that hopefully guides the plan of treatment to the proper end result. Perspectives of different terminologies =Anatomical terms= All teeth have two general sections, the crown and the root. Because the crown is covered with enamel and the root is covered with cementum, the line at which these two sections join is called the cementoenamel junction. In health, the roots of teeth are entirely surrounded by and submerged in the alveolar bone of either the maxilla or the mandible, depending on whether the tooth in question is an upper or a lower tooth, up until the cementoenamel junction. Overlying the bone is the gingival soft tissue, which is, on average, about 1 millimeter in thickness.Fermin A. Carranza. CARRANZA'S CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY, 9th edition, 2002. page 16 Because of this gingiva, the crown, which exists entirely outside of the surrounding bone, is somewhat obscured at the apical millimeter or so. Thus, crown and root can be used as anatomical terms, defining the actual parts of a tooth. Gingival recession is a related condition to decreased crown-to-root ratio, but referring to gingiva. =Clinical terms= These terms can also be used to refer to the clinical sense of the words, as relative crown and relative root, by describing how much tooth remains surrounded by bone. As the inflammation associated with periodontal disease causes the bone to resorb and disappear, revealing more of the root structure, the effective crown height in relation to the effective root height is reduced and the prognosis shifts from favorable to unfavorable. Clinical importance X-ray film displays horizontal bone loss of the mandible, in the lower right quadrant. Although the two premolars and the molar exhibit moderate to severe bone loss, there was no tooth mobility at the time this film was taken. Clinically, the anatomical definitions don't really matter; what is important in terms of support for the teeth within the bone is how much of the teeth remain embedded; this is where the crown-to-root ratio becomes important. Naturally, the cementoenamel junction exists much closer to the incisal or occlusal surface of a tooth than to the tip of the root or roots. Because of this fact, root length is considerably longer than crown length, and this helps allow for proper support of the teeth during normal function, not unlike a tree that has a root system hidden below ground which is more often than not considerably larger and more elaborate than the form taken by the growing branches. If a towering tree doesn't have enough support provided by its root system, it will easily be knocked over in even a slight wind; similarly, a tooth requires a sturdy root system encased in bone to protect it from being knocked out of the mouth. The natural crown-to-root ratio is thus termed a favorable crown-to- root ratio, because the root system existing within the surrounding bone is more than sufficient to support the tooth under normal physiologic stresses. After some bone loss is incurred, though, and more root structure is visible outside of the supporting bone, not only is there less effective root support, but there is an increased height of revealed tooth structure that this now diminished submerged root is responsible for supporting. In a way, then, each millimeter of lost bone contributes, for example, to a millimeter of less support and a millimeter of more structure to support. As can be extrapolated, this can easily become a very serious problem once three, four or five millimeters of bone have been lost due to periodontal disease.Fermin A. Carranza. CARRANZA'S CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY, 9th edition, 2002. page 481 The minimum crown-to-root ratio necessary is 1:1; any less support provided by the roots drastically reduces the prognosis of the tooth and its restoration. Models of human teeth as they exist within the alveolar bone. The roots, as they can be seen through the transparent \\"bone\\", exist naturally in greater inciso-apical lengths than the crowns. Teeth are constantly subject to both horizontal and vertical occlusal forces. With the center of rotation of the tooth acting as a fulcrum, the surface of bone adjacent to the pressured side of the tooth will undergo resorption and disappear, while the surface of bone adjacent to the tensioned side of the tooth will undergo apposition and increase in volume.Trauma from Occlusion Handout, Dr. Michael Deasy, Department of Periodontics, NJDS 2007. page 4 When the amount of root remaining in the bone is so short that the entire surface of bone adjacent to the root surface is constantly under compression or tension (with no middle section acting as a stabilizer for the fulcrum), the prognosis for the tooth is deemed highly unfavorable. This is usually the outcome associated with untreated secondary occlusal trauma.

It was developed by Intamin (as a Tow boat ride); designed by Ton van de Ven and started operating in 1981. History and details Pagoda rising in the back View from the Pagoda Gondoletta is the attraction with the strongest connection to the roots of the Foundation Nature Park the Efteling. With the destruction of a large part of the Dutch economy during the Second World War the rampant unemployment of the time forced the government to institute New Deal ‚Äìlike employment programs. In the case of Kaatsheuvel, the local employment agency formed a joint- venture with The Royal Dutch Moor Company' (or \\" Koninklijke Nederlandsche Heidemaatschappij\\" in Dutch); the part of the company involved with land reclamation and development still exists today under the name Arcadis. The development of the nature park started in 1950 with the construction of a lake; connected to a decorative ponds with a channel, forests and recreation facilities. For the construction of Gondoletta the channel had to be diverted to create a closed circuit; it no longer connects to the canoe -pond but curves back to the Decorative Pond. The ride's boarding platform uses a rotating disk, a system later implemented in Carnival Festival, Fata Morgana and Pira√±a. The boats themselves were originally designed for Fata Morgana, the ride that opened in 1986 on another water location in the park. The ride shows the park's spectacular landscaping, passing through the Channel and the Decorative Pond (harbouring a large population of Basses, Pike Perches and Carpses) up to the Railroad Bridge of the Efteling Steam Train Company (which crosses the pond at ground level): 50,000 square meters of seasonal plants, like 200,000 tulips, 50,000 violets and hundreds of thousands of Begonias, Narcissuses, African daisy, Rhododendrons, Begonias, Busy Lizzies, Pelargonium geraniums, and Lobelias, amongst others, are planted on the banks of the forests of pine, conifer and deciduous trees and ferns. Some 150 different species of water birds have been sighted, most noticeably Black swans, Mandarin ducks, Mallards, Egyptian geese, Moorhens, Coots, Black- headed gulls and Grey herons Ride length: 20 minutes; 1000 meters Ride capacity: 40 boats; 1100 passengers/ hour Cost: ‚Ç¨2 million On one of the ride's islands, that connects the Brink with the Rough Realm using bridges, a Wishing well is located since 1985 that collects money for the foundation Save the Children.

Their sons were later Serbian kings Stefan Dragutin (1276-1282) and Stefan Milutin (1282-1321). As a dowager-queen, she held provincial governorship in the regions of Zeta and Travunija (until 1308). She built Gradac monastery and was known for her religious tolerance. She is revered as saint by the Serbian Orthodox Church. Life Gradac Monastery was founded by Queen Helen =Origin= Helena‚Ä≤s origin is not known for certain. Her hagiography, written by Serbian Archbishop Danilo II (1324-1337), states only that she \\"was of a French family\\" (), while later continuators of the same work noted that her \\"family was of royal or imperial blood\\". By the beginning of 20th century, several genealogical theories on her origin were proposed, based mainly on examination of historical data related to Helena‚Ä≤s sister Maria and her family, including Maria‚Ä≤s husband Anselm, who was a high dignitary of the Kingdom of Naples. One of those theories advocated that Helena was of Angevine origin. That theory was based on free interpretation of some sources from the 1280s and 1290s, showing that Angevine kings of Naples referred to Queen Helen of Serbia as dear cousin. Based on that, some researchers started to advocate Helena‚Ä≤s direct origin from the House of Anjou, coining the term \\"Helen of Anjou\\" (Jelena An≈æujska). In spite of not being supported by sources, the term became more popular during the 1920s and 1930s. It was promoted not only by journalists and publicists, but also by some scholars. Stating that Helen was of French origin, John Fine assumed that she was \\"probably of the Valois family\\". There was no doubt that Helena had a sister named Maria, who was mentioned in several documents. In the summer of 1280, king Charles I of Sicily issued a document, allowing lady Maria to travel from Apulia to Serbia, to visit her sister, the queen of Serbia (). In later documents, issued in 1281, Maria was mentioned by king Charles as his cousin (), and widow of Anselm \\"de Chau\\" (). Gordon McDaniel proposed that Maria‚Ä≤s husband Anselm \\"de Chau, who was Captain General in Albania (1273-1274) for Charles I of Naples, was the same person as Anselm \\"de Keu\\", who was mentioned in 1253-1254 as husband of Maria, daughter of John Angelos of Syrmia. According to McDaniel, Maria and her sister Helen were descended, trough their father John, from a side branch of the Byzantine emperor's family, and the Hungarian royal house. Parents of Maria Angelina are known from her marriage licenses, issued in 1253 and 1254 by the papal chancellery. The first mentions the marriage \\"inter Anselmum de Keu ac Mariam, natam Matildis dominae de Posaga, natae comitissae Viennensis\\", while the second mentions \\"Maria, nate quondam Calojohanni\\" and also mentions Maria‚Ä≤s maternal uncle as \\"imperatore Constantinopolitano, eiusdem Matildis avunculo\\". Those data allowed McDaniel to identify Maria‚Ä≤s father as John Angelos, lord of Syrmia, and Maria‚Ä≤s mother as Matilda, daughter of Henry I, Count of Vianden and Margaret Courtenay (sister of the Latin emperors Robert and Baldwin II). Family connections of Helen and her sister Maria have been a special subject of several genealogical and historical studies that tried to resolve questions related to prosopography of various royal and noble families, including some complex questions related to Maria‚Ä≤s husband by attribution of sources on (at least) two persons (father and son) who had the same name: Anselm de Cayeux. =Queen of Serbia= Stefan Uro≈° I, with their eldest son, Dragutin. A 13th century fresco in the Sopoƒáani monastery) Helen married King Stefan Uro≈° I of Serbia (1243-1276), around 1245-1250. In 1276, conflict broke out between her husband and their eldest son Stefan Dragutin. King Uro≈° abdicated, and later died in 1280. During the reign of her sons Stefan Dragutin (1276-1282) and Stefan Milutin (1282-1231), dowager-queen Helen held provincial administration in the regions of Zeta and Travunia, until 1308. She proved to be a successful administrator, governing regions with mixed Serbian Orthodox and Roman Catholic population. Soon after that, she became a nun at the Church of St. Nicholas in Skadar, where she died on 8 February 1314. She was canonized by the Serbian Orthodox Church. Her feast day is . Queen Helen significantly contributed to the cultural rise of the medieval Serbian state. She had a library at her court and encouraged transcription of books in monasteries. She founded the first girls' school in medieval Serbia. One of Helen's palaces was in the town of Brnjak (sometimes called \\"Brnjaci\\") in the territory of modern Kosovo.

Considered a classic of Nepali literature, Muna Madan remains a popular poem and is taught in schools. The plot follows Madan, newly married to Muna, who leaves for Lhasa in Tibet to make his fortune despite protests from his wife. Devkota's Muna Madan is believed to be based on an 18th-century Nepal Bhasa ballad called 'Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni' ('It has not been a month since I returned'). Page 253. Page 5.Hutt, Michael (1991). Himalayan Voices: An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature. University of California Press. . The song, which is popular in Newar society, tells the story of a merchant from Kathmandu who leaves for Tibet on business, leaving behind his newly wed bride. The wife is concerned for his safety as the journey to Tibet is filled with hardships, and she pleads with him not to go. But he leaves despite her protests. When he returns home after many years, he finds that she has died.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 84.  Synopsis  Muna Madan follows the life of Madan, a Chhetri man from Kathmandu who leaves Muna, his wife, to go to Lhasa to earn a fortune. He is cautioned against leaving by both Muna and his elderly mother, but he decides to leave anyway. While he initially intends to spend just a few weeks in Lhasa, he spends a longer time there, becoming entranced by the city's beauty. He finally sets off for Kathmandu but falls sick with cholera on the way. His travelling companion, Ram, returns to Kathmandu and tells Muna that her husband has died. But Madan is rescued by a 'Bhote', a Tibetan man. Tibet is called 'Bhot' in the Nepali language, drawn from the classical Tibetan name for Tibet, Bod. The Tibetan nurses Madan back to health, leading Madan to realize that men are great not because of their castes but because of their hearts.Peebles, Patrick (2012). Voices of South Asia: Essential Readings from Antiquity to the Present. M.E. Sharpe. . Page 157. In the Nepali Hindu caste system, a Tibetan, as a meat-eating Buddhist, would've been considered 'untouchable' by devout Hindus. The couplet uttered by Madan while touching the Tibetan's feet, a sign of great respect in Khas Nepali culture, has since taken on the status of modern proverbs, often uttered by Nepalis in their daily speech: > ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡•ã ‡§õ‡•ã‡§∞‡•ã ‡§Ø‡•ã ‡§™‡§æ‡§â ‡§õ‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§õ, ‡§ò‡§ø‡§®‡§≤‡•á ‡§õ‡•Å‡§¶‡•à‡§® ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§†‡•Ç‡§≤‡•ã ‡§¶‡§ø‡§≤‡§≤‡•á ‡§π‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§õ, ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§≤‡•á > ‡§π‡•Å‡§¶‡•à‡§® This son of a Chetri touches your feet, but he touches them not with > contempt, a man must be judged by the size of his heart, not by his name or > his caste (trans. Hutt). When Madan finally returns to Kathmandu, he discovers that his elderly mother has died of old age while Muna has died of a broken heart.Shrestha, Dayaram (2006). Nepal Sahitya Ka Kehi Prista. Lalitpur: Sajha Prakashan. Madan comes to conclusion that riches have little value when you have no one to share them with. He vows to follow them into death and subsequently passes away at the end of the poem.  Writing  Before Muna Madan, Devkota had primarily been influenced by the English Romantics, but with this poem, he took a quintessentially Nepali folk tradition as his inspiration, the jhyaure meter. Devkota was reportedly was inspired to write a poem in jhyaure by the singing of women plating rice in the fields during the Nepali month of Asar. He chose to write in Asare Jhyaure, the poetic meter of central Nepali rice-planting songs. His choice of the jhyaure meter was a controversial one, as the folk meter was associated among Kathmandu's literary elite with flirtation and the erotic. Stirr argues that the poem \\"created a link between his elite world and the worlds of ordinary Nepali people of various castes and ethnic groups, bringing hallmarks of folk song and vernacular erotic poetry into a refined atmosphere where meticulous Sanskrit aesthetics and Brahminical Hindu morality were the norms.\\" Devkota also moved away from the baroque style of the Romantics and wrote Muna Madan in much simpler Nepali, an attempt to create something that was purely Nepali in character. Devkota also used the epic form to comment on various socio-political issues, namely the pursuit of wealth at the cost of family and the Hindu caste system. Another of the poem's couplets that has entered common usage occurs when Muna is entreating Madan not to go to Lhasa for the sake of riches: > ‡§π‡§æ‡§§‡§ï‡§æ ‡§Æ‡•à‡§≤‡§æ ‡§∏‡•Å‡§®‡§ï‡§æ ‡§•‡•à‡§≤‡§æ ‡§ï‡•á ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡•Å ‡§ß‡§®‡§≤‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§ó ‡§∞ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§®‡•Å ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§è‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¨‡•á‡§∏ ‡§Ü‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§®‡§≤‡•á > Purses of gold are like the dirt on your hands, what can be done with > wealth? Better to eat only nettles and greens with happiness in your heart > (trans. Hutt). Although Devkota would go on to produce epic works of immense literary significance, like Shakuntala, Sulochana, and Maharana Pratap, Muna Madan was reportedly his most beloved poem. While on his deathbed in 1959, he is believed to have said that \\"even though all of his works might perish after his demise, Muna and Madan should be saved\\". Muna Madan remains one of the most commercially successful Nepali books ever published.  Characters  * Madan ‚Äì A Chhetri man from Kathmandu who goes to Lhasa to earn money. * Muna ‚Äì Madan's newly married wife. * Aama ‚Äì Madan's mother * Unnamed Tibetan who saves Madan's life * Ram ‚Äì Madan's companion  Themes  At the heart of the poem is the relationship between Madan and Muna, hence the title of the play. While ostensibly a love poem, much of the narrative follows Madan on his journey to Lhasa and back. The overall theme of the poem is that the pursuit of material wealth can have serious consequences and that riches are of no use when there is no one to share them with. Devkota also makes a bold statement against the prevailing caste system, by having his devout Chhetri protagonist touch the feet of the 'untouchable' Tibetan man. The poem presents a distinct contrast between the masculine Madan who goes off on an trip to provide for his family and the feminine Muna who is \\"a paragon of high-caste Hindu female virtue, enclosed in the home and waiting for her husband\\".  Influence  Muna Madan is among Devkota's most popular and most accessible works. It is regularly studied in schools as an introduction to modern Nepali poetry and remains a best-seller for its publisher, Sajha Prakashan. It's impact on Nepali language and culture is perhaps second to none, with many rhyming couplets entering the Nepali vernacular as proverbs. Hutt has also argued that Muna Madan established the jhyƒÅure meter as one of the ‚Äúnative‚Äù meters of Nepal.  Adaptations  The poem has been adapted into a movie of the same name. The film was directed by Gyanendra Deuja, starring Aviyana Dhakal and Usha Poudel in the role of Muna. Muna Madan was Nepal's official submission for the 2004 Academy Awards.

It was stationed at Brooks City-Base in San Antonio, Texas. The wing was established in October 1961 as the Aerospace Medical Division to bring aerospace medical research, education and clinical medicine under one headquarters However, it continued research into human factors and performance that had begun in the United States air arm in 1918. Organization * Performance Enhancement Directorate : Included the Concept of Operations, Performance Enhancement Research and Warfighter Operations Divisions * Air Force Institute of Operational Health : Included the Risk Analysis, Surveillance and Operations Directorates History =Background and predecessors= Spinning chair test of a pilot candidate The 311th Human Systems Wings's origins can be traced to 19 January 1918, when the United States Army Air Service formed the Medical Research Laboratory at Hazelhurst Field, on Long Island, New York. Hazelhurst was selected as the most important Army flying school on the east coast. Initial work at Hazelhurst included experiments with low pressure chambers and development of psychological profile tests.Alcott & Williford, p. 4 When Hazlehurst closed at the end of World War I, the laboratory moved to nearby Mitchel Field, where it combined with the School for Flight Surgeons. In 1922, the laboratory and school became School of Aviation Medicine and the focus became training flight surgeons, with experimentation limited to ways to improve their training. Four years later the School moved to San Antonio, Texas, where Air Corps flying training was now concentrated.Alcott & Williford, p. 8 It was first located at Brooks Field, the center of primary flight training. When Randolph Field opened as the \\"West Point of the Air\\" in October 1931 the school moved there. The school and its successors remained at Randolph until 1959, when they returned to Brooks, where the Aerospace Medical Center of Air Training Command was formed the same year. Meanwhile, in 1935, a new laboratory was established at Wright Field, Ohio to investigate the harsh environment confronting military aviators. Its first commander was Captain Harry G. Armstrong, later United States Air Force Surgeon General. Among the laboratory's first significant research was that leading to the construction of practical pressurized cabins,Alcott & Williford, p. 9 In 1949 a Human Resources Research Center was established at Lackland Air Force Base, which developed classification and other tests, focusing on ways to improve personal effectiveness. However, some of these functions were under Air Training Command, while others fell under Air Research and Development Command, while the School of Aerospace Medicine was now part of Air University.Alcott & Williford, pp. 12, 17 =Single manager= Although the need for an Air Force Medical Center had been identified as early as 1946, it was not until 1957 that construction of facilities began at Brooks to bring these plans to fruition.Alcott & Williford, pp. 14‚Äì16 The organization of the Aerospace Medical Center was an initial step in placing the management of aerospace medical research, education and clinical medicine under one headquarters. The center and its subordinate units were reassigned from Air Training Command to Air Force Systems Command, which formed the Aerospace Medical Division as the new headquarters, one that under various names would continue until 2009. This also represented a change in focus from fliers' medical needs to encompassing all life studies research.Alcott & Williford, p. 26 The division managed laboratories, a hospital, a clinic, and a school. It conducted aerospace medical research, provided medical care to United States Air Force personnel, and conducted medical education programs. 1960s: Space and the Vietnam War Illustration of USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory The division's medical testing was conducted not only for Air Force personnel, but also for NASA astronauts in Project Mercury.The name of the rhesus monkey used in the first test of a space capsule ejection system was Sam, for School of Aerospace Medicine. Alcott & Williford, p. 22. Throughout Project Mercury, the division's medical facilities prepared astronauts for their missions and examined them after their return to earth.Alcott & Williford, p. 36 However, the expectation that the Aerospace Medical Division would be the \\"national center for aerospace medical studies\\" faded as NASA developed its own medical research facilities. By agreement with the Department of Defense, NASA took the lead in this area, although the division continued to participate in occasional projects.Alcott & Williford, p. 39 The division continued to take the lead in medical support for programs for which the Air Force was the lead agency, such as the Manned Orbiting Laboratory.Alcott & Williford, p. 40This program was cancelled in 1969. Alcott & Williford, p. 42. The transfer of space medicine to NASA made it apparent by 1970 that the facilities at Holloman Air Force Base were no longer cost effective, and the 6571st Aeromedical Research Laboratory was inactivated in December.Alcott & Williford, p. 46 The War in Vietnam saw the division's School of Aerospace Medicine training load expand as the number of medical specialists in the Air Force grew. Courses were also added on tropical diseases and aeromedical evacuation. The division also kept a seven-person team in Saigon under the control of the Agency for International Development to augment civilian health services there. It helped develop body armor for aircrews of low and slow flying aircraft. More unusually, the division was involved with the initial development of lateral sighting techniques and the original FC-47 gunships.Alcott & Williford, pp. 47‚Äì49 1970s: Occupational health In the 1970s, the division's mission responsibilities expanded to include occupational and environmental health oversight for the Air Force, when occupational health laboratories at McClellan Air Force Base, California and Kelly Air Force Base, Texas were combined with a radiological laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, into the Air Force Occupational and Environmental Health Laboratory at Brooks.Alcott & Williford, p. 58 In the following decade, the division's mission expanded beyond aeromedical research, and included development and fielding of biotechnology systems, doing not only research and testing but following through with the production of systems.Alcott & Williford, pp. 58‚Äì59 Its hospital and clinic responsibilities, on the other hand were transferred to another organization.Alcott & Williford, pp. 62‚Äì63 1980s: Human Systems Division In 1986, the Department of Defense began streamlining its organization as a result of the Packard Commission recommendations. The division restructured its functional areas and was renamed the Human Systems Division on 6 February 1987. In December 1990, Air Force Systems Command consolidated its 16 laboratories nationwide into four. Brooks and the Human Systems Division became home of one of the \\"super labs,\\" the Harry G. Armstrong Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory. On 1 July 1992, the division was renamed the Human Systems Center when the Air Force Systems Command and Air Force Logistics Command were combined into Air Force Materiel Command. 1990s: Gulf War and conversion to a wing During the Gulf War, the Human Systems Division provided technological support for Americans in Southwest Asia, including chemical warfare equipment. The division had conducted studies on chemical protective equipment as early as the mid-60s and established an operating location at the Army's Biomedical Laboratory at Edgewood Arsenal in 1981. In the 1990s, it served as the Air Force agent for human-centered research, development, acquisition, and specialized operational support. In October 1997, the Air Force consolidated its four \\"super labs\\" into one lab, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The four laboratories' 25 directorates were streamlined into ten directorates. The Armstrong Laboratory's former functions and organizations at Brooks (minus some that were transferred to the Human Systems Center and U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine) became the Human Effectiveness Directorate of AFRL. The reduced Human Systems Center was placed under the command of the Aeronautical Systems Center at Wright- Patterson a year later. On 1 October 1998, the center was redesignated the 311th Human Systems Wing. The wing focused on aerospace medicine, environmental safety, and occupational health programs for the Air Force. On 5 October 2009 the 311th Human Systems Wing was inactivated and its 311th Mission Support Group became the 311th Air Base Group to manage the remaining Air Force operations at Brooks City-Base as the installation moved toward closure in September 2011 as directed by the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The air base group provided oversight of closure functions, while some support functions were transferred to units at nearby Randolph and Lackland Air Force Bases. =Predecessor organizations= * Medical Research Laboratory (later Medical Research Laboratory and School for Flight Surgeons, School of Aviation Medicine, AAF School of Aviation Medicine), 19 January 1918 ‚Äì 15 September 1944 : Hazelhurst Field (1918‚Äì1919), Mitchel Field (1919‚Äì1926), Brooks Field (1926‚Äì1931) Randolph Field 1931‚Äì1944) * 27th AAF Base Unit (AAF [later AF, USAF] School of Aviation Medicine), 15 September 1944 ‚Äì 27 August 1948 : Randolph Field (later Randolph Air Force Base) * USAF School of Aviation Medicine (later USAF School of Aerospace Medicine), 27 August 1948 ‚Äì 2 October 2009 * Aerospace Medical Center, 1 October 1959 ‚Äì 15 April 1962 : Brooks Air Force BaseAlcott & Williford, pp. 154‚Äì155 Lineage * Constituted as the Aerospace Medical Division on 1 November 1961, activated and organized : Redesignated Human Systems Division on 6 February 1987 : Redesignated Human Systems Center on 1 July 1992 : Redesignated 311th Human Systems Wing on 1 October 1998 : Inactivated on 2 October 2009Lineage, including assignments and station in Robertson, Factsheet 311 Human Systems Wing =Assignments= * Air Force Systems Command, 1 November 1951 * Air Force Materiel Command, 1 July 1992 * Aeronautical Systems Center, 1 October 1998 ‚Äì 2 October 2009 =Components= ; Centers * Aerospace Medical Center, 1 November 1961 ‚Äì 15 April 1962 * Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center (see USAF Hospital, Lackland) ; Groups * 70th Air Base Group: 1 October 1994 ‚Äì 1 October 1998 * 311th Air Base Group (later 311th Mission Support Group): 1 October 1998 ‚Äì 2 October 2009 * 6570th Air Base Group (later 648th Support Group, 648th Air Base Group): 1 November 1961 ‚Äì 1 October 1994Alcott & Williford, p. 160 ; Medical care units * USAF Hospital, Lackland (later Wilford Hall USAF Hospital, Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center): Attached 1 November 1961, assigned 15 April 1962 ‚Äì 1 January 1987Alcott & Williford, p. 28Alcott & Williford, p. 153 * 6570 USAF Dispensary: 1 November 1966 ‚Äì 1 December 1970Alcott & Williford, p. 161 * USAF Dispensary, Brooks (later USAF Clinic, Brooks): 1 December 1970 ‚Äì c. 16 February 1987 ; School * USAF School of Aerospace Medicine: 1 November 1961 ‚Äì 2 October 2009 ; Laboratories * 6570 Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory: 1 December 1961 ‚Äì 8 September 1979Alcott & Williford, p. 156 * 6570 Personnel Research Laboratory: 1 December 1961 ‚Äì 8 September 1979Alcott & Williford, p. 159 : Lackland Air Force Base, Texas * 6571 Aeromedical Research Laboratory: 1 December 1961 ‚Äì 31 December 1970 : Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico * Air Force Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory: 8 September 1979 ‚Äì December 1990 : Lackland Air Force Base, Texas * Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory: 14 January 1985 ‚Äì 1 December 1990Alcott & Williford, p. 65 * Air Force Epidemiology Laboratory: 1 December 1961 ‚Äì unknown : Lackland Air Force Base, Texas * Air Force Human Resources Research Laboratory (later Harry G.

As a historian and a poet Muhammad Saleh is best remembered for his work Amal-i Salih, also referred to as Shah Jahan Namah (The History of Shah Jahan), which he completed in 1659‚Äì60 AD. Amal-i-Salih is an account of the life and reign of Shah Jahan. However, the work also includes information on Shah Jahan's predecessors (particularly Akbar and Jahangir) and a compendium of biographies of the Shaikhs, poets, and other notables who were contemporaries with Shah Jahan. It is considered to be one of the most important original sources of events during Shah Jahan's reign.

Biography  Born in Rome to a family of architects and artisans, he rose to prominence under the mentorship of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, and even inherited the position as chief architect of the Fabbrica di San Pietro (Workshop of St. Peter's Basilica) in 1680 after the master died. In that post, he continued the work that had been started by Bernini on the outside colonnade and the Ponte Sant‚ÄôAngelo. He worked during a period with notable competitors, including the prolific Carlo Fontana. Among his works are the facades of the churches of St. Gall and San Francesco a Ripa (built 1681‚Äì1701); finishing touches or reconstruction for Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, Santa Maria di Montesanto, and Santa Croce e San Bonaventura dei Lucchesi; the customs office in Ripa Grande; the Palazzo Muti Papazzurri (attributed, 1660); the tomb monument to Giovanna Garzoni in Santi Luca e Martina; the Mausoleum of Leo X; and the monument to Clement X in St. Peter's Basilica. This latter funereal monument was designed by de Rossi, but the sculptures were completed by Lazzaro Morelli, Ercole Ferrata and Giuseppe Mazzuoli. He was Principe or director of the Accademia di San Luca in 1681 and 1690‚Äì1693, when replaced by Carlo Fontana One new attribution is the design, perhaps along with Bernini, of the centralized church and complex of San Bonaventura at Monterano (1677), which, even in its present ruined state, recalls other mountain-top sanctuary churches in Italy. The buildings were commissioned by the Principe Don Angelo Altieri, nephew of Pope Clement X, who had just acquired the surrounding estate. It was for the Padri delle Scuole Pie, a group of priests engaged in education. In 1683 de Rossi worked for Camillo Pamphilj in Valmontone, a little town not far from Rome. Here he planned the new main church, the Collegiata, or Church of Saint Mary, inspired by the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone by Borromini (Rome) and the Church of the Assunta in Ariccia, by Bernini. In 1685 de' Rossi decorated on behalf of Cardinal Raimondo Capizucchi the chapel of San Paolo in the church of Santa Maria in Campitelli.

She worked closely with Fauve artists like Henri Matisse, and was active in exhibiting her artworks in Paris, particularly with Berthe Weill.Linda L. Clark Women and Achievement in Nineteenth-Century Europe 2008 ‚Äì Page 97 \\"In such circumstances, √âmilie Charmy and Jacqueline Marval, both first trained for schoolteaching in the provinces, appreciated Berthe Weill's promotion of their work. Weill opened a gallery in Paris in 1901 and was one of the few women art ...\\" She had become an artist against the norms for French women in her day and became a well-regarded artist. She painted still lifes, landscapes, portraits, and figure paintings. Unusually for a woman at the time, she made a number of paintings of nude women in poses of sexual abandon. Charmy's initial works were Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. As her career evolved she was influenced by Fauvism and the School of Paris movements. She was a recipient of the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.  Early life  √âmilie Esp√©rance Barret was born on April 2, 1878, in Saint-Etienne, France.Delia Gaze.

Orphaned when she was 15, she and her older brother Jean Barret then lived with relatives in Lyon. √âmilie had a talent for both art and music as a child.Biography. Emile Charmy website. Retrieved March 20, 2014.  Education  √âmilie received a bourgeois educational training at a Catholic private school, and qualified to become a teacher, which if a woman were to have a career was limited to education.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 23. When living at Lyon, she refused teaching jobs in the late 1890s and went to study and work in the studio of Jacques Martin. This was a critical moment in the further development of her career. Martin was involved with a number of other Lyon artists who became influential in √âmilie's artistic development, including Louis Carrand and Fran√ßois Vernay who had a local reputation for a unique approach to flower painting. During this time she assumed the name √âmilie Charmy as her pseudonym.  Career  = Overview = When women were shunned from the art world, and most women regarded painting as a hobby, Charmy was consumed by her work and was entirely financially dependent on her art. For her, \\"painting was an obsession which dominated many other aspects of her life\\".Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 85. Charmy primarily painted women in domestic or bourgeois settings, as well as pictures of flowers and still- life.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 25. Her flower paintings and still-life paintings were very marketable because they were considered decorative, and were sought after by the middle class.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 52. In regards to Charmy's nude paintings, Gill Perry proposes that Charmy is intentionally trying to restrict the viewer from the intimate scenes that she depicts. French novelist Roland Dorgel√®s described Charmy as \\"a great free painter; beyond influences and without method, she creates her own separate kingdom where the flights of her sensibility rule alone.\\" There is a great sense of abstraction in her images, with varying opinions by art critics. Her bold use of color and her unapologetic brushstrokes have been deemed as \\"appropriating...a 'masculine' language of art production\\", according to her contemporaries.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 55. The most famous quote came from Roland Dorgel√®s: It is Charmy's resistance to traditional gender roles that makes her unique for her time.Christopher Green. Art in France, 1900‚Äì1940. Yale University Press; 2000. . p. 169. For her career and depiction of nude women in a period in which that was unusual for women, she epitomized the New Woman of the 19th century and early 20th century.Cornelia Schulze. The Battle of the Sexes in D.H. Lawrence's Prose, Poetry and Paintings. Universit√§tsverlag C. Winter; 2002. . p. 52. In terms of the business side of her career, Charmy refused to sign contracts with art dealers and gallery owners, save for one unsuccessful contract with the dealer P√©trid√®s in the early 1930s.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 89. = Early career = In the 1890s, Charmy began making Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings of subjects that ranged from prostitutes and brothels to scenes of middle-class family life. For instance, she made orient-influenced Girl with a Fan , a morphine addict in Woman in an Armchair , a group of nude prostitutes in La Salon, cultured women in Card Players and Interior in Saint-Etienne . In 1902 or 1903, Charmy and her brother left Lyon for Saint-Cloud, near Paris. Charmy exhibited her works a number of galleries, but they were not exhibited with her male contemporary artists, and therefore were not assessed in the same professional manner as paintings made by male modernist painters. Her first documented show was at the \\"Salon des Ind√©pendants\\" in 1904, and it is likely that it was through this show that she befriended other Fauve artists, like Henri Matisse, Charles Camoin, and Albert Marquet. In 1905 she exhibited two still-life paintings titled Dahlias and Fruit, at the Salon d'Automne.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 46. Which were seen and appreciated by Berthe Weill, who from then on promoted her work and became a good friend.√âmilie Charmy Special Exhibition: August 23, 2013 ‚Äì February 2, 2014. The Fralin Museum of Art, University of Virginia. p, 4. Retrieved March 20, 2014. In 1906, she showed 5 flower paintings and one still life titled Prunes, also at the Salon d'Automne. = Fauvism = Influenced by other artists at the time such as Matisse, she integrated Fauvism techniques into her paintings, as seen in Woman in a Japanese Dressing Gown (1907). As a result of \\"experiments with colour, thickly applied paint and seemingly crude brushwork she produced a series of bold and technically innovative paintings\\". Concerning Woman in a Japanese Dressing Gown, Charmy \\"adopts a theme which also appears in works by Matisse, Camoin, Derain, and Marquet from 1905, shortly after Matisse's wife had purchased a Japanese kimono and posed in it for members of the group\\". Their compositions feature the perfect and conventional image of femininity, with all of its decorative, and oriental/primitive references. Charmy's depiction is a significant contrast, as her subject \\"despite her oriental dressing gown, is represented as the modern woman without the ornamental or coiffured hair. She assumes an almost hieratic standing pose, in the center of the canvas, and stares out somewhat disconcertingly, directly at the viewer. She seems to stand out rigidly against her domestic interior, a rigidity which is emphasized by the use of bright colors outlined in dark brushwork.\\" Other paintings from this period include the landscapes Piana, Corsica (1906), L'Estaque and Corsican Landscape made when she traveled to the coast of the French Mediterranean and Corsica with Matisse and his friends. An unconventional aspect of her style was to leave parts of her canvas unpainted in this series of paintings, a technique used by her male Fauve counterparts.Steve Edwards; Paul Wood. Art of the Avant-gardes. Yale University Press; 2004. . p. 78. Charmy established a studio in Paris at 54 Rue de Bourgogne in 1908. She moved there permanently in 1910 and remained there for the rest of her life.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 151. Paintings that she made of Corsica and the French Mediterranean were exhibited at Eug√®ne Druet's gallery in 1911 in Paris. In 1912, her first major solo exhibition was held at the Galerie Clovis Sagot. It is listed as having a minimum of forty oil paintings and twenty five watercolors. Charmy is remembered in the United States as being one of the artists who exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, where she exhibited 4 works, Roses, Paysage, Soir, and Ajaccio.Brown, Milton W., The Story of the Armory Show, The Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation, 1963, p. 231 This exhibition is also where Arthur Jerome Eddy purchased L'Estaque, and he \\"praised the picture or its arbitrary, abstract colors and bold, decorative composition in his 1914 Cubists and Post Impressionism.\\" Fellow artist and her lover, George Bouche, had a home in scenic Marnat, which is believed to be the subject of her paintings The Path toward the House and Landscape, made between 1913 and 1915. The works represented a shift to more intimate pictures made with vigorous brushstrokes and a palette of medium-light to dark tones.√âmilie Charmy Special Exhibition: August 23, 2013 ‚Äì February 2, 2014. The Fralin Museum of Art, University of Virginia. p. 6. Retrieved March 20, 2014. = School of Paris = In the 1910s Bertha Weill began exhibiting her work. Her style evolved again during that decade, this time to that of the School of Paris. Her work became increasingly respected by art critics, such as Louis Vauxcelle who in 1921 described her as \\"one of the most remarkable woman [artists] of our time\\". Recognizing the difference between Charmy's work and that of the stereotypically refined feminine artist, writer Roland Dorgel√®s said the same year that she \\"sees like a woman and paints like a man\\". A solo exhibition of her work was held in 1919 at the Galerie Andr√© Pesson. Also in 1919, Charmy makes the acquaintance of the Count Etienne de Jouvencel, who becomes a patron of her work.Mus√©e Paul Dini. Suzanne Valadon, Jacqueline Marval, √âmilie Charmy, Georgette Agutte: les femmes peintres et l'avant-garde, 1900‚Äì1930. Somogy; 2006. . p. 49. An exhibition of Charmy's work was held at the Galerie ≈íuvres d‚ÄôArt in 1921. = Feminine Art = Women artists were generally banned from art studios or academies during sessions with live models, so many women painted bourgeois life by default.Gillian Perry. Gender and Art. Yale University Press; 1999. . p. 201. Yet, Charmy's work exhibits an interest in painting female models and prostitutes, including expression of women's sexuality. Such images of women are common among male artists such as Degas, but were rare among women artists. Most women artists were interested in painting an idyllic view of women and their children.Gillian Perry. Gender and Art. Yale University Press; 1999. . p. 207. Despite Charmy's interest in using female models as subjects for her paintings, she avoided the mother-and- child theme that was becoming increasingly popular, especially with contemporary artists like Mary Cassatt. Author and art historian Matthew Affron said of Charmy's choice of subject matter that \\"the key issues in Charmy's putative naturalism ‚Äì the anthropocentrism, the revival of historical genres, and the modernist conception of brushwork as the sign of artistic expression ‚Äì came together most vividly in her painting of the nude. Uniformly female, the nudes appear in simple interior settings. Frequently their poses evoke academic and salon-style precedents, including many variations on the single figure standing or seated, prone or supine, or reclined laterally either toward or away from the viewer. Charmy often worked with studio models, and she also was interested in the subgenre of the nude portrait. Some of these images bear such a strong resemblance to the artist that they are considered self-depictions.\\" There have been many speculations as to why Charmy chose such a controversial subject matter. One interpretation, is that \\"in adopting a contradictory viewing position (i.e. that of a woman viewing the female sexuality) and a modern technique, she has produced an ambiguous version of a popular contemporary theme... Charmy has appropriated and reworked a 'male gaze' removing some of the erotic pleasure involved in the part of the viewing subject.\\" In 1921, Charmy had a solo exhibition at the Galerie d'Oeuvres d'Art, and showed paintings of flowers, women, and female nudes. The show caused quite a stir in the Parisian art scene, and sparked a number of critical issues concerning \\"feminine\\" art.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 98. The show was organized by Count de Jouvencel, who had discovered her at Berthe Weill's gallery in 1919.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 96. Around 1922, Charmy met Colette, whom she befriended. Colette, at that time at the height of her popularity, wrote the introductory text for the catalog of a major exhibition of twenty pictures by Charmy, held in 1922. The same year, Charmy participated in another major exhibition at the Styles Gallery, on the theme of the \\"Female Nude\\", which included paintings by Ingres, Delacroix, Corot, Manet, Renoir, Rouault and Matisse, and a catalog prefaced by Louis Vauxcelles. = Later years = In 1926, another major solo exhibition of Charmy's work was held at the Galerie Barbazanges. She exhibited her works less frequently in the 1920s and 1930s, but had a number of patrons and collectors who supported her work. Charmy made paintings when she had been at her villa at Ablon-sur-Seine, including two made between 1926 and 1930, View of the Seine at Ablon, which is at the Mus√©e de Grenoble, and Banks of the Seine at Ablon, at Galerie Michel Descours in Lyon. She also painted still lifes, nudes and self-portraits.√âmilie Charmy Special Exhibition: August 23, 2013 ‚Äì February 2, 2014. The Fralin Museum of Art, University of Virginia. pp. 8‚Äì9. Retrieved March 20, 2014. In the 1930s, Charmy was a member and exhibited her works at Femmes Artistes Modernes. After the war, Charmy exhibited less often than she had at the height of her career, but she continued to paint into her 90s.  Recognition  She was the recipient of the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor award,Petteys, Chris, Dictionary of Women Artists, G K Hill & Co. publishers, 1985 which was partly due to Eli-Joseph Bois, Director of the Petit Parisien newspaper. Bois also introduced her to several political figures, including √âdouard Daladier, Aristide Briand, and Louise Weiss, with whom she became close.Mus√©e Paul Dini. Suzanne Valadon, Jacqueline Marval, √âmilie Charmy, Georgette Agutte: les femmes peintres et l'avant-garde, 1900‚Äì1930. Somogy; 2006. . p. 51.  Personal life  In 1912 she met the painter George Bouche, and they had a son, Edmond, in 1915. Charmy and Bouche married in 1935. Edmond, like Charmy, was placed in the care of paid nurses and carers until the age of fourteen. Although this was acceptable during Charmy's childhood, this practice was becoming increasingly rare as traditional roles of motherhood were becoming more popular. In one biography, Edmond notes that \\"while some mothers glory in their offspring, Charmy hid hers jealously. This newly born knew neither the disorder of the studio nor the smell of paint.\\"Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 84. Charmy was almost scorned by her art dealer, Berthe Weill, because she viewed Charmy's relationship with her son Edmond as distant and unnatural.Perry, Gill. Women Artists and the Parisian Avant-Garde. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, distributed by St. Martin's Press, 1995. p. 83. After World War I, Charmy and Bouche had a villa in Ablon-sur-Seine, as well as the studio-apartment in Paris. Her husband died in 1941 and during World War II, she and her son Edmond lived in Marnat in \\"isolated circumstances\\". After the war she returned to Paris, but many of the people that she knew in the art community were no longer there.√âmilie Charmy Special Exhibition: August 23, 2013 ‚Äì February 2, 2014.

Biography He was born in Addrup, Cloppenburg (district), Germany, and emigrated to the United States as a child. He completed his classical and theological studies at St. Xavier's College in Cincinnati and St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia. He was ordained as a priest on December 8, 1847 at Cincinnati, after which he was stationed for ten years at Columbus. In 1859, he was made rector of St. Peter's Cathedral in Cincinnati, and remained there until he was consecrated titular Bishop of Calydon and administrator of Detroit on April 24, 1870. The first bishop of Detroit, Frederick Rese, became demented four years after his consecration and was called to Rome. He never resigned his charge and lived until December 30, 1871. As a consequence, Detroit was ruled by an administrator for thirty years, and Borgess assumed the title of bishop in 1871. He resigned the see April 16, 1888, and spent his last days in retirement, having received the titular see of Phacusites. He died at Kalamazoo, Michigan.

G. Wodehouse, which first appeared in the United States in the 26 March 1950 issue of This Week magazine. Part of the Blandings Castle canon, it features the absent-minded peer Lord Emsworth, and was included in the collection Nothing Serious (1950).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 84‚Äì85, A70. The story's title is a play on Death of a Salesman, the now-classic stageplay by Arthur Miller, which had won a Pulitzer Prize the previous year. Plot summary Lord Emsworth is visiting America for the wedding of his niece Veronica to millionaire Tipton Plimsoll. With currency restrictions forcing him to stay at Freddie's house in Long Island, Emsworth finds himself ill at ease, chafed by his son's new-found self-confidence, the result of his successes as a salesman. Left alone in the house one day, Emsworth finds the cold lunch left for him unappealing, and resolves to fix himself some scrambled eggs. This task proves more difficult than he recalled from his more active youth, and when a young girl calls at the door selling richly bound encyclopaedias of Sport, he invites her in to make them for him and join him at his lunch. The girl, who is only known as \\"Mrs Ed\\", reveals she is trying to earn money, as she has a baby on the way. Emsworth's sense of chivalry is aroused, and he offers to sell her encyclopaedias for her, while she has a lie down on the couch. He heads at once for the house of a near neighbour, who Freddie had earlier warned him had a conspicuous habit of throwing wild parties and filling his house with blondes while his wife was away. This behaviour, striking Emsworth as indicative of a sporting nature, persuades the elderly peer that the man must also be in need of his encyclopaedias. Nervously approaching the house, Emsworth is embarrassed by a carful of blondes, but carries on manfully. After a failed attempt to knock at the door, a Pekinese named Eisenhower, property of one of the blondes, chases him up a tree. The homeowner, lumber king George Spenlow, already unnerved having seen Emsworth mooning over his flower beds earlier in the day, mistakes him for a private eye in the hire of his wife. He approaches Emsworth and offers him a bribe, which Emsworth innocently confuses with an offer to buy his encyclopaedias. He takes the man's $500, and quietly slips it into Mrs Ed's handbag while she sleeps, resolving to put a stop to his son's arrogance right away.

The Taistoists were an interior opposition group in the Communist Party of Finland. They were named after their leader Taisto Sinisalo whose first name means \\"a battle\\", \\"a fight\\" or \\"a struggle\\". Sinisalo's supporters constituted a party within a party, but pressure from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union prevented the party from formally splitting.

Although they were sometimes identified as \\"Stalinists\\", this was not a central part of their orthodoxy. The opposition was expelled from the party 1985‚Äì1986 and it formed the Communist Party of Finland (Unity), which took the name \\"Communist Party of Finland\\" after the original party's bankruptcy in 1992.

She was laid down on 23 January 1896, and launched on 21 October 1896, when she was named by Lady Currie, wife of Castle Line shipowner Sir Donald Currie. She served in the Easter Division of the Channel Squadron under the command of Captain Harry Seawell Niblett, and was briefly docked at Chatham in January 1900 to make good defects. In March 1901 Diadem was one of two cruisers to escort , commissioned as royal yacht for the world tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George and Queen Mary), from Spithead to Gibraltar, and in September the same year she again escorted the royal yacht from St Vincent to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In January 1902 it was announced that she would be put out of commission due to \\"defects which will take some time to remedy\\". She was paid off at Chatham on 11 February 1902, and in May transported to Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Glasgow for repairs to her hull and machinery. The ship was reactivated and sent to China Station where Diadem became the flagship of the vice-admiral until 1907. The vessel then returned home and was paid off in April 1907. She was then assigned to the Home Fleet based at Portsmouth from 1907-1912 before transferring to the Third Fleet.

Background He was sired by Epsom Derby winner Roberto out of the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame mare Desert Vixen. Real Shadai was bred by Franklin Groves' North Ridge Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, and sold at the 1980 Keeneland July yearling sale for $360,000 to the renowned Japanese horseman Zenya Yoshida. As he had done before with his Champion colt Northern Taste, Yoshida turned Real Shadai over to trainer John Cunnington, Jr. at the Great Stables in Chantilly. Racing career In 1981, Real Shadai was a non-winner in his two starts at age two. Out of his six races the following year, he won two, the most important of which was the 1982Grand Prix de Deauville. His other significant outing was a second-place finish in the 1982 GI Prix du Jockey Club to Robert Sangster's colt Assert. Entered in the 1982 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Real Shadai was up against a very strong field that included Assert along with Ardross, April Run, Akiyda, and one of the great international racing fillies of all time, All Along. After finishing fifth to winner Akiyda, Real Shadai was retired from racing.

He was the leading sire in Japan in 1993, and his progeny earned in excess of US$110 million. Among his notable offspring were Shadai Kagura, Japan's Champion Three-Year-Old Filly in 1989 and winner of the Oka Sho (Japanese 1000 Guineas), as well as Rice Shower, who captured the 1992 Domestic Grade I Kikuka Sho (Japanese St. Leger) and was a two-time winner of the Domestic Grade I Tenno Sho (Spring) (1993, 1995).

From approximately late 1941, Schw√§germann served as the adjutant for Joseph Goebbels. He reached the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer (captain). Schw√§germann survived World War II and was held in American captivity from 25 June 1945 until 24 April 1947. Life up to 1945 Born in Uelzen, Schw√§germann attended secondary school and later joined the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler on 8 April 1937. He was sent to the SS-Junkerschule Bad T√∂lz for officers' training from October 1938 until September 1939. He later served with the 4th SS Polizei Division in France and Russia, and lost an eye to a Russian rifle-butt on the Eastern front. After this injury he became the adjutant for Joseph Goebbels and was promoted to the rank of SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer. Later on 29 November 1944, he was promoted to the rank of SS- Hauptsturmf√ºhrer. In January 1945, Goebbels sent Schw√§germann to his villa at Lanke, ordering him to bring his wife, Magda, and their children to stay at an air raid shelter on Schwanenwerder. In the Reich Chancellery bunker By 22 April 1945, the Soviets were attacking Berlin and Joseph and Magda Goebbels brought their children to the Vorbunker to stay. Schw√§germann came with them. Adolf Hitler had already taken up residence in the lower F√ºhrerbunker in January 1945. It was in that protected bunker complex below the Reich Chancellery garden of Berlin that Hitler and a few loyal personnel were gathered to direct the city's final defence. By the time of Hitler's death on 30 April 1945, the Soviet Army was less than 500 metres from the bunker complex. On 1 May 1945, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, Helmut Kunz, to inject his six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Ludwig Stumpfegger, Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide. At around 20:30, Goebbels and his wife, Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de gr√¢ce immediately afterwards. Schw√§germann testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw√§germann then walked up the remaining stairs and once outside he saw the lifeless bodies of the couple. Following Joseph Goebbels' prior order, Schw√§germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move. The bodies were then doused with petrol, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried. =Breakout= In one of Hitler's last orders, he had given permission for the Berlin forces to attempt a breakout of the Soviet encirclement after his death. General Helmuth Weidling, commander of the Berlin Defence Area, and SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke, the (Kommandant) Battle Commander for the centre government district, devised a plan to escape out from Berlin to the Allies on the western side of the Elbe or to the German Army to the North. Mohnke split up the Reich Chancellery and F√ºhrerbunker soldiers and personnel into ten main groups. Schw√§germann was in one of the breakout groups of 1 May. The group, including Werner Naumann, Hans Baur, Georg Betz, Alfred Rach, and Ludwig Stumpfegger, walked underground along the U-Bahn. They were joined by Artur Axmann before surfacing at Stadtmitte station, and later by Martin Bormann. At Lehrter Bahnhof they split up, Schw√§germann, Naumann, and Rach heading west along Invalidenstra√üe towards Moabit. They hid in industrial wasteground for several days before escaping Berlin and reaching the American Zone to the west. After the war Schw√§germann reunited with his wife in Munich and lived incognito until 25 June 1945, when the couple were reported to the Counterintelligence Corps and taken into U.S. custody. Schw√§germann remained a prisoner of war in various camps until 24 April 1947. Later in life, he lived in northern Germany. In February 1948 in Hanover he gave two interviews and a written statement about Hitler's last days, English translations of which were made for Michael Musmanno.; In 1951 he was among the ex-comrades under Werner Naumann who infiltrated the Lower Saxony branch of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and got elected to its Landtag. He commented publicly in June 1954 on The Last Days of Hitler by Hugh Trevor-Roper, among whose sources was the transcript of Schw√§germann's 1945‚Äì6 debriefing by the US military, but who did not himself speak to Schw√§germann. In the 1950s Schw√§germann founded an import‚Äìexport company named Labora in Munich with Hartmann Lauterbacher's brother Hans.; ; In 1960 the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) requested the US Central Intelligence Agency's file on Schw√§germann.; Labora was later sold as a front company to the BND. According to Erich Kuby, in 1965 Schw√§germann was a federal civil servant in Munich.

She edited the Journal of Phonetics from 1990 to 1994. Perhaps her most significant contribution to linguistics is the fact that in 1987, together with John Kingston, she organized the first Laboratory Phonology conference at Columbus, Ohio, and served with Kingston as series editor for the Cambridge University Press series Papers in Laboratory Phonology from 1987 through 2004. The laboratory phonology movement was one of the two most important developments during the 1990s in the linguistic subdisciplines that study language sound systems, and gave rise to the Association for Laboratory Phonology. The other important development was Optimality Theory. Beckman received her PhD from Cornell University in 1984, was a Postdoctoral member of the technical staff in \\"Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence Research\\" at AT&T; Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, and joined the faculty at Ohio State University in 1985. In 1988 she won a Presidential Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. She has directed at least twenty-five PhD dissertations to completion at Ohio State University. Her early research focused on prosody and the development of the Tones and Boundary Indexes (ToBI) system of intonation transcription.

Arkoff, and Debra Hill for the Showtime network in 1994. The concept was a 10-week series of 1950s \\"drive-in classic\\" B-movies remade \\"with a '90s edge\\". The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, \\"what it would be like if you made Rebel Without a Cause today. It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off\\". Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, Raging Hormones but Showtime decided on Rebel Highway instead. Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's films, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted. In addition, they had the right to a final cut and to select their own director of photography and the editor. Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses. According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, \\"They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.' And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era. We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation\\". The series premiered with Robert Rodriguez's Roadracers on July 22, 1994.

Reception In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker wrote, \\"It is the whimsical notion behind the Rebel Highway series to take a group of mostly grade-D exploitation films from the '50s and remake them, with good actors and directors, in the '90s\\". In his review for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the series \\"is at best a collection of offbeat so-called B-films, though given the state of American movies at the moment this is a much more sizable achievement than it might at first appear‚Äìespecially considering that the whole system that once supported B-films no longer exists\\".

It is the oldest rugby club in the United States, and fields Division I Men's and Women's teams, U-19 Boy's and U-19 Girls teams, two old boy teams, one of which belongs to the non-competitive \\"Golden Oldies\\". The NYRC was founded to continue a rugby tradition that dates back to the formation of the NYRFC in 1929. The original club was formed in 1929 as the New York Nomads. They subsequently began competing as the New York Rugby Football Club (New York RFC). The New York RFC played a principal role in the development of the Eastern Rugby Union. It was the only team in the United States to be accepted for membership in the Rugby Union for the 1932-33 international directory and in 1933, hosted the Cambridge University Vandals, the first European club to tour the United States. The New York RFC continued to compete successfully until the beginning of World War II. It disbanded during the War and resumed activities afterward. In 1957, the New York RFC created the New York Rugby Football Club, Inc. (\\"NYRFC\\") under the Membership Corporations Law of New York State. In 1959, the NYRFC organized its first seven-a-side rugby tournament. Since then \\"New York Sevens\\" has been conducted annually on the first Saturday following the Thanksgiving Holiday and grown into the largest international sevens tournament in the United States. During the 1960s and 1970s the NYRFC was a dominant force in the Eastern United States. In 1977, The NYRFC made a Winter-tour contest of matches in the Caribbean and Florida. NYRFC played the Freeport, Bahamas team and the team from Nassau, Bahamas. The Winter tour ended with the NYRFC playing very good Miami RFC team. In 1982, the NYRFC merged with Eastside RFC (formerly Hunter College RFC). The NYRFC was the first United States team to be invited to compete in Scandinavia, touring Denmark in 1986. The team competed in Mexico in 1986, Japan, Thailand, Italy and Philippines in 1989, Bahamas in 1991, Argentina and Brazil in 1992, England, Ireland and Wales in 1994 and Spain in 1997. In 1997, the NYRFC voted to field a women's team and offered playing membership to former players of the Gotham Women's Rugby Club.

It is the second Methodist Church to be built in Singapore after the Methodist Episcopal Church at Coleman Street which subsequently became a school hall. It is located in Fort Canning Hill. History On 7 February 1885, William Fitzjames Oldham was appointed to head the Methodist Church in Singapore. He arrived with James Mills Thoburn and together they conducted a series of evangelistic rallies in the Town Hall (later the Victoria Memorial Hall) and Sunday evening worship services. The congregation was known as the English Church and met weekly in the Town Hall. Through fundraising and Oldham‚Äôs contributions, the first Methodist church in Singapore was built at Coleman Street and dedicated on 15 December 1886, named the Methodist Episcopal Church. Its congregation then mostly consisted of foreigners and English- speaking government officials that were based in Singapore.Cornerstone that was laid by the then Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson.In early 1907, Sir John Anderson, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, granted a 38,000 square foot plot of land at Fort Canning for a church to be erected on a hill, \\"on the Tanglin side of the Museum\\". In 1907, the church at Coleman Street was sold to the Anglo-Chinese School (becoming its hall.) and money was raised to build a new church. Anderson personally laid the cornerstone with an inscribed silver trowel on 12 December 1907. After completion, the first worship at the new compound was held on 25 December 1908, and formal dedications were done on 4 February 1909 by Bishop William Oldham. It was only on 7 January 1910 that the church was renamed the Wesley Methodist Church after the founder of Methodism, John Wesley. Around 1929, there was an influx of members to the church, mostly foreign military personnel. With the increase in members, there was a need to expand the church. The Wesley Hall was built and dedicated on 10 April 1927. In 1937, the interior of the church and hall were renovated, where new lights, pulpit, floor tiles and a Hammond electric organ were added. In 1942, Wesley's growth was interrupted during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II. Her building was stripped and used as an ammunition depot by the Imperial Japanese Army. After the war ended in 1945, the congregation re-formed on 12 September 1945 despite the poor state of the building. Items that survived the war were the stained-glass windows, which had been removed for safekeeping, a badly damaged Hammond organ, donated lanterns and the marble baptismal font. On Easter Day, 16 May 1948, a re-dedication service was held after extensive renovations. In the mid-1950s, the church saw its first Asian pastor. It was repainted in November 1955, along with a new roadway. An upper room was also constructed in the main church tower for pastors to rest. In 1977, the church began on an extension programme to improve the sanctuary by installing air- conditioning and increasing its seating capacity. The nave and north end of the transept were extended. However, this compromised on the original cross shape of the building, resulting in an L-shape. In addition, a 4-storey educational block with a concert hall and a 2-level basement carpark was added. The rosettes on the walls were changed, while the rosette in the chancel was preserved. This extension project cost $1.2 million and was completed in October 1979. In 1982, a baptismal hall was also constructed to add to the Sanctuary, along with basement rooms and a Plaza (Wesley Plaza). On 13 December 1987, a groundbreaking ceremony was held for a new extension, which was later topped off on 26 November 1988. It was dedicated on 9 September 1989 by Bishop Ho Chee Sin, Bishop Emeritus T R Doraisamy and Bishop Emeritus Kao Jih Chung. To accommodate the large number of worshippers, the church signed a 5-year lease for two floors of office space at the YWCA Fort Canning Lodge. On 28 September 2010, another upgrading project was implemented with a dedication service to create 36,000 square feet of usable space. With a budget of up to $12.3 million, the upgrading project was finally completed by the end of 2012. A new plaza hall was created on top of the sanctuary extension with a glass canopy to shelter the courtyard from weather. More seats were added and another chapel was constructed in the basement, along with movable partitions for the rooms. Trusses were added to the roof and tiles were replaced. The altar was also reconfigured along with the shift of the main door to align with the nave. Lanterns that were gifted by friends of the church in the 1940s were installed at the front of the church. There was also an overhaul for the kitchen in the church. In 2015, the church began another project to refurbish the sanctuary.. Architecture Floor Plan of the Sanctuary with original cross highlighted The building is in a toned-down Gothic Revival style, built of red brick with tracery and mullion details in white stone or stucco. It was designed by David McLeod Craik of Swan and Maclaren.. The interior originally consisted of a nave and two transepts, with a wooden hammerbeam roof. The church was extensively remodelled and extended in 1977 and 1988, doubling the length of the nave. Aisles were also provided by turning the original windows into arched openings and extending the roof. Additional rooms were created in extensions to the transepts, and a new building containing a multi-purpose hall and more rooms constructed beside it. This building was decorated in the same colour scheme as the original church, but with few other similarities. While the capacity of the church was greatly increased, the building lost most of its original fa√ßades, as well as much (if not most) of its original exterior appearance. Seemingly oddly-placed gothic finials emerging from the tiled roof indicate where the original fa√ßades once were. Although the new construction used the same combination of brick and plaster as the original structure, it is quite utilitarian and lacks the details and grace of the original, both on the exterior and interior. For instance, the new portion of the nave has a plain pitched roof without the carved wooden hammerbeams in the older portion, and the placement of windows and other openings bears no relation to the original structure. = Former buildings = Architecture Drawing of the Fort Canning Church's ParsonageA parsonage was also located next to the church for the pastor‚Äôs family to live in and was designed with a colonial influenced style redesigned to accommodate the tropical climate of Singapore. It also had long columns that extended from the ground floor to the top floors for air circulation, borrowing the concept from traditional Malay buildings. In 1926, a social hall dubbed the Wesley Hall was built. It was a basic rectangular building adjacent to the church that served its simple purpose of a place for meetings, conferences and concerts. In the 1960s, the Wesley Hall was demolished and a multipurpose hall was built in its place. Bricks and plasterworks were used to integrate the old and new buildings.

Construction Amphitrite was built by Vickers, Sons & Maxim, Ltd, at Barrow in Furness. She was laid down on 8 December 1896, and launched on 5 July 1898, when she was christened by Mrs. Vickers, wife of Thomas Vickers, Chairman of the shipbuilding company. She was inspected at Chatham in February 1900, and passed into the Fleet Reserve. Pre-war service history Amphitrite was commissioned at Chatham on 17 September 1901 by Captain William Stokes Rees to take out reliefs to the Mediterranean Station. She left Sheerness on 28 September 1901 for Malta with a new crew for the battleship HMS Illustrious, which had undergone a refit. Bringing back invalids from the garrisons at Malta and Gibraltar, she arrived in Plymouth to land them on 20 October 1901, then proceeded to Portsmouth. The following month she was ordered to go to China with new crews for the despatch vessel HMS Alacrity and the draught steamer HMS Snipe. She arrived at Hong Kong on 4 January 1902. On her return she went ashore in the bay of Suez in early February, but soon came loose and arrived home at Plymouth 21 February with crews from the China station. She paid off on 20 March, but was recommissioned the following day for service on the China Station, with Captain Charles Windham appointed in command. =China station= Amphitrite left Portsmouth for the China station on 6 May 1902, bringing crew for the draught steamer , which was stationed at Hong Kong. She arrived in Bombay on 30 June 1902, following a cruise in the Persian Gulf, during which she had made a long stop in Muscat. The largest warship thus far to visit the gulf, she drew much interest during the cruise. She stopped in Colombo in mid-July, at Singapore in late July, and arrived at the station headquarters at Hong Kong on 1 August. First World War She served in the First World War with her sisters. In 1914 she was part of the Ninth Cruiser Squadron, serving in the Atlantic. In June 1915 she was placed in reserve, but reactivated as a Minelayer in 1917. She collided with the destroyer in the North Sea on 8 September 1918, which sunk Nessus. She was later assigned to the Nore Command, and survived the war to be sold to Ward of Milford Haven for breaking up on 12 April 1920. Amphitrite had the nickname 'am and tripe'News and Events : Royal Navy amongst her crew based on a humorous malapropism, and a reference to common foodstuffs such as might be served on board.

Education and career Mazzone was born Armando David Mazzone in Everett, Massachusetts, to immigrant parents. He was a star tight end on the Everett High School football team, where he won all-scholastic honors, and he later played tight end on the Harvard College team. After graduating from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950, he became a supervisor at Inland Steel Corp., a steel mill in East Chicago, Indiana. He served in the United States Army for two years during the Korean War, then returned to the steel mill and enrolled at DePaul University College of Law, graduating with a Juris Doctor in 1957. After law school, he opened a small law office in Chicago, Illinois, but soon returned to Massachusetts, where he spent two years as an Assistant District Attorney of Middlesex County and four years as an Assistant United States Attorney under Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr. In 1965, Mazzone and three other Assistant United States Attorneys resigned to open their own law firm, Moulton, Looney, Mazzone, & Falk. They were later joined by former US Attorney, Paul Markham. He remained in private practice until his appointment to the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by Governor Michael Dukakis in 1974. Federal judicial service Mazzone was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on January 26, 1978, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated by Judge Frank Jerome Murray. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 7, 1978, and received his commission on February 10, 1978. He assumed senior status on June 3, 1993. His service terminated on October 25, 2004, due to his death in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Boston Harbor case In the early 1980s, the Conservation Law Foundation and the City of Quincy, Massachusetts sued the regional Metropolitan District Commission, saying that it violated clean water statutes because its antiquated sewage treatment plant on Deer Island was dumping hundreds of tons of black sludge into the harbor daily. The United States Environmental Protection Agency later joined the suit. Judge Mazzone ruled the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (which was the successor to the Municipal District Commission's operations of the Boston regional water and sewage systems), was in \\"chronic, flagrant violation\\" of federal law, and ordered it to set deadlines for a cleanup. He oversaw the case himself, rather than appointing a special master as judges often do in long-running cases. Judicial philosophy Judge Mazzone was known for his dedication not only to headline-producing cases, but to the routine caseload of a federal court, which he characterized as \\"doing the nation's work.\\"\\"Presentation of the Portrait of the Honorable A.

Few of us have the brilliance of a (Judge Charles E.) Wyzanski or a (Judge) Learned Hand. What you have is a respect for the law, a knowledge of the principles and a desire to do the best job you can. Good lawyers make good judges. Any lawyer can make a judge look bad. But a good lawyer playing by the rules, playing it straight makes a good case, and the judge is merely incidental, truly an impartial arbiter.

This genus includes two species, N. spectabile and N. sternoptychum. Taxonomy Nannoptopoma is classified within the tribe Hypoptopomatini of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae. It is most closely related to the genus Hypoptopoma with which it has a sister group relationship. Distribution N. spectabile is known from the upper Amazon and Orinoco basins of Colombia, and N. sternoptychum is known from the lower Amazon River basin and tributaries below 200 metres (660 ft) elevation. Physical description Nannoptopoma differs from other members of the subfamily Hypoptopomatinae by osteological differences. They have no adipose fin, a greatly depressed snout and head, eyes visible from below, and a body that is not elongate or depressed. This genus is most similar in external appearance to Hypoptopoma, though Nannoptopoma species lack pectoral fin spine serrae characteristics of Hypoptopoma and have a shorter, stockier body. Both species reach about 3 centimetres (1.2 in) SL. N. sternoptychum differs from N. spectabile in head shape, pectoral fin length, and some meristic features. Males have an elongate genital papilla and enlarged pelvic fin odontodes. Also, there is a patch of odontodes involving four paired plates on either side of the pre-anal shield between the pelvic fin origin and the anus, possibly involved in increased adhesion in mating encounters.

It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy. In his position as court painter for the Medici, Bronzino was author of several portraits of Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. In this portrait, Cosimo is represented in his younger years, commanding and proud; and to quote Giorgio Vasari, \\"clad with white armor and a hand over the helmet\\". It has been identified as having been painted in the Medicis' Villa of Poggio a Caiano in 1545. Bronzino's portrait captures Duke Cosimo I following a great diplomatic triumph. Cosimo had, at long last, rid Florence of the Spanish garrisons that had been stationed there since the early 1530s, when Pope Clement VII (Giulio de' Medici) and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V agreed that Florence would become an Imperial duchy, governed by the Medici. Charles V stationed the garrisons in Florence ostensibly to protect its first duke, Alessandro de Medici, from those who might rise up against him or otherwise do him harm. Cosimo I however chaffed under the watch of the Spanish troops, and in 1543, in return for a monetary payment to Charles V, (the latter needed funds to fight Protestants in Northern Europe), the duke obtained the evacuation of the garrisons stationed in Florence. Bronzino painted about 25 only slightly differing versions of the portrait. References *Artnet.it: Portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici‚Äî *Robert B.

She was formerly a professor of pharmacology at the University of Montreal and the Director of the Cardiac Development Research Unit at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr√©al (IRCM) where she held a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Cardiovascular Cell Differentiation. She is a professor of biochemistry at the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Medicine, and also served as vice-president of research at the University of Ottawa from 2006 to 2017. On September 26, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that after a selection process, Nemer was chosen as Canada's new Chief Science Advisor ‚Äì the first national science advisor since 2008.  Early life  Nemer was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1957 where she found her passion for chemistry. At the age of 17, she and her classmates successfully advocated to create a science stream at her all-girls school. She left Lebanon during the civil war and moved to Kansas where she obtained a bachelor's degree in 1977, majoring in chemistry with minors in French and mathematics at Wichita State University. In the summer of 1977, Nemer visited Montreal with friends. The visit convinced her to attend graduate school in the city. She went on to complete a PhD in bio-organic chemistry from McGill University in 1982 under the supervision of Kelvin Ogilvie. Career Nemer's research focuses on cardiac formation and function ‚Äì specifically the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that register the genetic expression of cardiac cells. She is best known for isolating genes that regulate ventricular hypertrophy which manifests itself in an increase volume of the heart and a thickening of the myocardial wall. Her work has contributed to the development of diagnostic tests for heart failure and the genetics of cardiac birth defects. Nemer has published over 150 scientific research articles to date, with over 10,000 citations and an h-index of 63. She has also trained over 100 students from Canada and other countries. In recognition of her research and achievements, Nemer has received numerous honours and awards, where notably she became a Royal Society of Canada fellow in 2001, and a member of the Order of Canada in 2014. Nemer served as Vice- President of Research at the University of Ottawa from 2006 to 2017, and also served as the Director of the Cardiac Development Research Unit at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montr√©al (IRCM). She founded the University of Ottawa's annual greeting card design competition. On Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2017, following a selection process, Nemer was appointed as Canada's new Chief Science Advisor for a three-year appointment. This role was previously eliminated in 2008 by the previous government, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. As Chief Science Advisor, Nemer heads a $2 million budget, where she is responsible for providing impartial scientific advice to the Prime Minister (Justin Trudeau) and the Minister of Science (Kirsty Duncan), ensuring government science is publicly accessible, that scientists can speak freely and promoting Canadian science both nationally and internationally. In addition, Nemer will report annually the state of federal government science in Canada. Following 100 days as the Chief Science Advisor, Nemer released a letter outlining her office's plans for 2018, which included developing scientific integrity policies and guidelines, recommending guidelines to ensure government scientists can speak freely about their research and preparing a framework to allow for open public access to federal government science. On July 30, 2018, Nemer's office published the Model Policy on Scientific Integrity in order to safeguard through collective agreements government scientists' right to speak. This was developed in partnership with the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC), officials at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat and the federal research community. Her office has also established an Independent Expert Panel on Aquaculture Science, chaired by Nemer, to provide appropriate scientific evidence in policy decisions related to aquaculture and impacts on the marine environment. On October 1, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Nemer's reappointment for another two years, effective September 25, 2020. Controversies On 27 March 2020, Nemer told the host of CBC Radio's Quirks and Quarks that the country needs randomly to test at least one per cent of the population to determine whether COVID-19 is as lethal as the population is led to believe. Nemer's \\"observations are right at the centre of a global clash of scientists over COVID-19 data and estimates of the seriousness of the pandemic,\\" says Terence Corcoran, a writer at the National Post.

He has coached one College World Series championship team and five NJCAA World Series championship teams. Also a former professional baseball player, Graham played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Early life Graham was born in Yoakum, Texas. His father, Earl moved the family to Houston to get a job. Wayne was the batboy for the 1945 semi-pro Finger Furniture baseball team coached by his father. Playing career Graham attended Reagan High School in Houston and played college baseball at the University of Texas, where he played two seasons under coach Bibb Falk. Graham was signed by the Phillies as an amateur free agent in 1957. He played eleven years in pro ball, with the Phillies and Mets organizations. Graham was named Texas minor league player of the year in 1962 after hitting .311 for the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers. Graham received two brief MLB call-ups in the early 1960s. In , he was recalled by the Phillies, playing in ten games for manager Gene Mauch. Graham then appeared in twenty games for the 1964 New York Mets under the tutelage of legendary skipper Casey Stengel. He batted .127 in 55 at-bats in his brief major league career. Coaching career =High school= When his playing career ended, Graham returned to the University of Texas to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education in 1970, and he later added a master's degree in education at the University of Houston in 1973. His coaching career began at Scarborough High School in Houston. Graham coached for nine seasons at Scarborough and one year at Spring Branch High School before moving on to coach junior college baseball at San Jacinto College in Houston. =San Jacinto= Beginning in 1981, Graham turned San Jacinto into the nation's most dominant JUCO baseball team. After regular conference titles in Graham's first few seasons, the Gators became a dominant force in 1984 when they began a run of seven consecutive 50-win seasons and berths in the NJCAA World Series in Grand Junction, Colorado. After losing in the 1984 championship game, San Jacinto won three consecutive titles from 1985‚Äì87. After falling short again in 1988, the Gators went back-to-back in 1989‚Äì90. Those five national titles in six years eventually led to Graham being named Junior College Coach of the Century by Collegiate Baseball. In his 11 seasons at San Jacinto, Graham posted a 675-113 record (.857 win percentage), earned five national coach of the year awards, and produced countless professional players, most notably Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte. =Rice= Graham took over at Rice in 1992. He inherited a program that had tallied only seven winning seasons in 78 years of Southwest Conference play and had only finished above fourth place once. As at San Jacinto, he turned the program into a national powerhouse. A program that had never before qualified for the NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament made 23 consecutive tournament appearances (1995‚Äì2017) and won 20 consecutive regular-season or tournament conference championships (1996‚Äì2015) in three different conferences (Southwest Conference, Western Athletic Conference, and Conference USA). Rice has also been to the College World Series seven times (1997, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008). Graham's crowning achievement was the 2003 College World Series, in which Rice won its first national championship in any sport in its 91-year history. Not one to rest on his laurels, Graham quipped during a post- game interview, \\"We want to do it again.\\" On April 16, 2016, Graham won his 1,100th Division I game (3-2 over Western Kentucky). He has more than 1,600 wins as a collegiate head coach.Rice Athletics: http://www.riceowls.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/graham_wayne00.html Graham was also largely responsible for Rice's on-campus baseball stadium, Reckling Park, being built in 2000. In 2004, Graham once again presided over history, as three Rice pitchers were drafted in the first eight picks of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft, the only time three teammates have ever been selected in the first round. Graham's Rice teams have produced first-round picks Jose Cruz, Jr. (1995), Matt Anderson (1997), Lance Berkman (1997), Bubba Crosby (1998), Kenny Baugh (2001), Jon Skaggs (2001), David Aardsma (2003), Philip Humber (2004), Jeff Niemann (2004), Wade Townsend (2004, 2005), Joe Savery (2007), and Anthony Rendon (2011). Eight of those players have been pitchers, and Graham is known for developing players that went undrafted out of high school, such as Niemann and Townsend. During the 2017 season, despite finishing in 6th place in Conference USA, Graham led Rice to their 23rd consecutive NCAA Tournament. Needing to win the Conference USA tournament title to qualify for the NCAA tournament and to keep the streak alive, he led to Owls to the conference title. Rice won four consecutive games and rallied late in the championship to upset #11 nationally ranked Southern Miss 5-4 on a walk-off double. Graham never had a losing season as a high school or college coach until his final season at Rice, 2018. His contract was not extended after that season.

Once a haven for Scottish Catholics in Rome, it was deconsecrated in 1962. History The church was built under Pope Clement VIII in 1592 with the title S.Andrea e S.Margherita regina. It was constructed for the Scottish expatriate community in Rome, especially for those intended for priesthood. The adjoining hospice was a shelter for Catholic Scots who escaped their country because of religious persecution. In 1615, Pope Paul V gave the hospice and the nearby Scots College to the Jesuits. It was rebuilt in 1645. They became more important when James Francis Edward Stuart, the Old Pretender, set his residence in Rome in 1717. It was abandoned during the French occupation of Rome in the late 18th century. In 1820, religious activity was resumed, but no longer by the Jesuits. It was reconstructed in 1869 by Luigi Poletti. The church was deconsecrated in 1962 and incorporated into a bank (Cassa di Risparmio delle Province Lombarde). The Scottish Seminary, the Pontificio Collegio Scozzese (Scots College, Rome), also moved away, to a new site on the Via Cassia. The Feast of St Andrew is still celebrated here on 30 November. Art The simple two-storied Baroque fa√ßade is only decorated with the cross and two fishes of Saint Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland. The former Scottish Seminary is still decorated with the coat of arms and motto of the country. The interior of the church was left intact after 1962. It has two aisles, side altars and barrel-vaulted ceiling. In the centre of the ceiling is a 16th-century fresco of St Andrew in Glory. The high altar was made in the 17th century. The altarpiece from the 18th century is by Scottish painter Gavin Hamilton, and depicts the Martyrdom of St Andrew. There is also an Enthroned Madonna with Sts Columba and Ninian by Alexander Maximilian Seitz. On both sides of the sanctuary there are hinged grates covering openings into tribunes where members of the exiled royal family would sit when they attended Mass.

It is housed in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Besan√ßon, France. A copy by Bronzino can be found in the Palazzo Vecchio. This portrayal of the Deposition, although it depicts all the characters typically shown when Jesus is being taken down from the cross, more correctly should be characterized as a Lamentation and is an excellent example of late Mannerism or Maniera. History The painting was originally commissioned to be the altarpiece for the chapel of Eleonora of Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. Shortly after it was completed in 1545, Eleonora's husband, Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, shipped the picture to Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle, a chief counselor of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, as a diplomatic gift. Granvelle installed it in his private chapel in Besan√ßon. In 1549, Granvelle commissioned the construction of a grander funerary chapel on his Besan√ßon estate. A year later, he died. The new chapel, with Bronzino's altarpiece installed, was consecrated in 1551. Subsequently, there is no record of the work from the seventeenth century until the French Revolution. To preserve it after Granvelle's chapel was partially destroyed, the picture was housed in the Besan√ßon city hall from 1793 until it became a part of the collection of the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts when the museum opened in 1834. After sending the original to Granvelle in 1545, Cosimo requested a copy for Eleonora's chapel that Bronzino painted eight years later in 1553. The second version is the one found in the Palazzo Vecchio today. Bronzino. St John the Baptist. c. 1542‚Äì45. Getty Center. To accompany the original altarpiece, Bronzino painted side panels depicting John the Baptist (the patron saint of Florence) on the left and Saint Cosmas (a patron saint of the Medici family and Cosimo's name-saint) on the right. Their inclusion in Eleonora's chapel was as much a political statement as a religious one and these panels may have been portraits of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere (Cosimo's father) as John the Baptist and Cosimo as Saint Cosmas. At some point between 1545 and 1553, Eleonora requested that Bronzino replace the side panels of the saints with more pious panels depicting the Annunciation. This must have been a low priority because the new altar wings were not completed until 1564, two years after Eleonora's death. The Annunciation panels can be viewed in Eleonora's chapel today. By 1553, the side panels of the saints were in storage. They were last recorded as being in the Medici inventory in 1609 and both were considered lost until the John the Baptist panel resurfaced in 1951. It is now housed in the Getty Center. A fragment of the Saint Cosmas panel was only recently rediscovered in a private collection. Composition In the center foreground is a Piet√† portraying the body of Jesus being cradled in his mother Mary's arms. The Apostle John supports his back and is modeled on a youth holding up the body of Christ in a Deposition painted by Bronzino's teacher, Pontormo. Mary Magdalene kneels on the right and supports the feet of Jesus. Her jar of ointment is shown in the far right foreground. Detail of Eleonora of Toledo as Mary of Clopas from the Deposition of Christ. Four holy women mourn on the left and another dressed in green peers over the Virgin's shoulder and stands out prominently because of her hand gesture and location in the center of the panel. Scholars believe this highlighted woman is one of the three Marys, Mary of Clopas. Two of the three men in the background are named in the Gospel of John as the followers who took Jesus down from the cross and prepared his body for burial. Nicodemus is depicted on the left holding a large ewer filled with embalming spices. On the right, Joseph of Arimathea holds the nails of the Crucifixion as well as the pincers used to remove them. The man between them is an unnamed companion. In addition to the nails held by Joseph, other Arma Christi (instruments of the Passion) are presented throughout the painting. The angels floating above the scene hold the column where Jesus was whipped, the sponge, the lance, and the cross. The crown of thorns is lying in the dirt at John's feet. The principal figures are attended by two angels, one bearing a chalice and the other lifting a transparent veil. Both of these objects are symbols of the Eucharist. The viewer can best appreciate the sacramental nature of the work by considering its original setting. The two angels are gazing out of the panel towards the sides. In Eleonora's chapel, they would appear to be looking at the frescoes of the story of Moses on the adjacent walls. In particular, the angel on the left would be gazing at a fresco of Moses Striking the Rock and the Gathering of the Manna. The manna and the water pouring from the rock presage the bread and wine used in the Eucharist. Altar wall of Eleonora's Chapel showing the second version of the Deposition, side panels of the Annunciation, and frescoes. In addition to embedding donor portraits and likenesses of themselves in their works, sixteenth-century Florentine artists were known to portray other artisans and associates in their paintings and sculptures. Since neither Bronzino nor his Medici employers documented the existence of embedded portraits in this work, art historians have postulated a number possibilities based on comparisons with other known portraits. Janet Cox-Rearick suggested that the central figure of Mary of Clopas was an idealized portrait of Eleonora herself and that the Virgin Mother was a representation of Cosimo's mother, Maria Salviati. She also proposed that Nicodemus, the unnamed companion, and Joseph of Arimathea were, respectively, portraits of Bronzino (the artist), Pontormo (his teacher), and Baccio Bandinelli (a rival artist who had submitted a modello for the altarpiece). Elizabeth Pilliod has an alternative suggestion: the three companions from left to right are portraits of Giovambattista del Tasso (the architect who created Eleonora's chapel), Francesco di Ser Jacopo (a financial administrator for Cosimo), and Niccol√≤ Tribolo (another artist in the service of the Medici). Bronzino's second version, in general, is an accurate copy of the first. The most obvious deviation is the darker, more subdued color. Much of the brilliant blue has been substituted with a drab brown. Toning down the Mannerist lavishness of the original is consistent with the sobriety of the Counter-Reformation and may reflect Eleonora's sensibilities.

St. George was laid down on 4 August 1943 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Tacoma, Washington, launched on 14 February 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Alfred E. Montgomery; and commissioned on 24 July 1944, Capt. Robert G. Armstrong in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations After shakedown, St. George sailed from San Pedro, California, on 12 October 1944 to salvage a seaplane which had crashed at sea. She was diverted to Pearl Harbor after word was received that the plane had sunk. After four days in Pearl Harbor, the ship sailed on 22 October to tend seaplanes in support of the Central Pacific drive. She stopped at Kwajalein between 29 October and 3 November, and then tended a squadron of aircraft at Eniwetok between 4 and 25 November. She moved frequently during the next four months, tending planes at Saipan between 28 November and 21 December; at Kossol Passage, Palau Islands, from 24 December 1944 to 6 February 1945, at Ulithi between 7 and 25 February, and at Saipan again from 27 February to 23 March. On 28 March, she arrived at Kerama Retto, Ryukyus, to support aircraft in the Okinawa operation.  Under attack by Japanese aircraft  During one of the frequent air raids there the ship's gunners shot down an enemy plane on 29 April. A week later, she was hit by a kamikaze. Thanks to a warning from Louis (Jack) Norvelle Tickle, an airplane mechanic who had been on deck at the time and was able to spot the Japanese before they hit, only three men were killed. Unfortunately, her seaplane crane was destroyed. Nevertheless, the tender remained on station, using a barge crane to lift seaplanes for repairs; and, in addition, provided repair support to destroyers and destroyer escorts.  Post-War operations She left Kerama Retto on 12 July for drydocking and repairs at Guam, returning on 21 August to Okinawa, where she rode out a typhoon on 16 and 17 September. On 20 September, the seaplane tender sailed to Wakayama Wan, Japan, where her aircraft provided surveillance of the Japanese Inland Sea and supplied passenger, mail, and courier service between Tokyo, Sasebo, and Okinawa. While there, she rode out two more typhoons. The ship proceeded to Sasebo on 14 November and tended aircraft there from 16 November until starting home on 12 February 1946.  Post-War decommissioning  She arrived at San Diego, California, on 25 March 1946 and was decommissioned and placed in reserve there on 1 August 1946. USS St. George was struck from the Navy list on 1 July 1963 and simultaneously transferred to the Maritime Administration's reserve fleet at Suisun Bay, California. She was reacquired by the U.S. Navy on 11 December 1968 for sale to Italy as Andrea Bafile.  Awards  USS St. George received one battle star for her World War II service.

The sample is interrupted by a loud scream from the band members. *\\"Born to be Abramo\\" is a re-recording of the band's banned 1990 single, featuring guest Patrick Hernandez singing a parody of his own hit \\"Born to Be Alive\\" on religious-themed Italian lyrics by missionary Gigi Cocquio. *\\"L'astronauta pasticcione\\" (\\"The bungling astronaut\\"), the first of two previously unreleased songs on the album, is a ballad about a very inept astronaut who gets sick with diarrhea as a result of space travel and ends up releasing his feces into his space suit, causing a horribly unbearable smell. The song, however, describes the event in a very sweet, almost poetical way. On a musical level, the song's chorus uses the chords from the 1975 song \\"Lighthouse\\" by James Taylor, as well as a reference to \\"Squonk\\" (1976) by Genesis. *\\"Introservi\\" is a ballad-like intro to the following track, \\"Servi della gleba\\", already released as a ghost track on ƒ∞talyan, rum casusu √ßikti. *\\"Servi della gleba\\", \\"Tapparella\\", \\"Pipppero\\" and \\"Burattino senza fichi\\" are all identical to the respective versions on the band's past albums. *\\"La terra dei cachi\\" is the studio version of the song, previously available only on a promo single. The band's live performance of the song at the 1996 Sanremo Music Festival was released on Eat the Phikis. *\\"L'eterna lotta tra il bene e il male\\" (\\"The eternal fight between good and evil\\"), the second previously unreleased song on the album, uses the backing track to the 1995 song \\"Very Good Very Bad\\", from the Bollywood film Trimurti, overlaid with multiple samples from a series of angry, offending and profane voicemails left on keyboard player Sergio Conforti's answering machine by an anonymous elderly lady from Milan, nicknamed \\"Nasty sciura\\" (\\"sciura\\" being Milanese for \\"lady\\") by Conforti (a.k.a. Rocco Tanica) - who apparently mistook him for the band's lead singer. In the voicemails, \\"Nasty sciura\\" repeatedly insults Conforti about the recurring use of vulgarity in the band's songs, accusing him (among other things) of having mentally corrupted her son. This track also includes a few lines sung by Elio on a melody from \\"Within You, Without You\\" by The Beatles. *\\"Abitudinario\\", \\"Supergiovane\\" and \\"John Holmes\\" are new recordings of the respective songs, with small alterations (mostly consisting in slight changes to the performances and the samples used on the tracks). *\\"Cara ti amo\\" is a completely new recording of the same-titled song, a surreal dialogue between two lovers, from Elio samaga hukapan kariyana turu. It is purported to be live but it was actually made in a studio, as the purported location of the live recording, \\"Baritone Women's Bar in Prugliasco, Switzerland\\", is invented - although \\"Planet of the Baritone Women\\" is a track from Frank Zappa's 1988 live album Broadway the Hard Way.. As on the previous album version, the dialogue (performed by Elio and Tanica) is almost completely improvised. *\\"Alfieri\\" (\\"Ensigns\\") is the only officially available version, recorded live in 1986 in a Legnano club, of the band's concluding song from their 1980s/early 1990s live shows, where, after a semi-serious verse by Elio, each band member introduces himself in a comedic verse, before ending with an equally comedic unison choir. On this particular recording, bassist Nicola Fasani (a.k.a. Faso or Pasto) and guitarist Davide Civaschi (a.k.a. Ces√†reo) are heard laughing throughout their verses and barely managing to sing their lyrics.\\"Alfieri\\" on YouTube *\\"Sos epidos\\" (\\"The debts\\" in Sardinian) is a satirical song about debts, sung in the local language by a group of Sardinian tenores.  Album title and artwork  The album title alludes to a series of best-of albums by Mina, all entitled Del mio meglio and numbered. (In 1997 the latest volume in Mina's series, released in 1987, was Volume 9.) The cover artwork is a stereotypical stock photo, vaguely similar to several other previous releases, depicting two silhouettes of a girl and a boy, holding hands in front of a sunset on the sea. According to a statement by Elio during an episode of Cordialmente (the band's own radio show on Radio Deejay), broadcast at the time, the photo actually depicts two males, although the reliability of such a statement is debatable.

He was one of the earliest Nigerian students who studied in the United States instead of the frequent route of studying in the United Kingdom.Kalu Ezera. Constitutional Developments in Nigeria: An Analytical Study of Nigeria's Constitution-Making Developments and the Historical and Political Factors That Affected Constitutional Change, 1960, p. 46. He was a deputy national president of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Early life and education Ita attended the Presbyterian Hope Waddell Training School in Calabar before pursuing his tertiary education at London University and Columbia University in New York. He stayed in the U.S. for 8 years. While in Calabar, he was exposed to the teachings of James Aggrey, who pursued academic opportunities for African students in Historical Black Colleges and Universities in America. Calabar became a training ground for some nationalist politicians due to the early site of secondary schools in the city and the influence of people like James Agrrey. Nigerian nationalism Ita was a leading Nigerian nationalist during British colonial rule. Upon his return from the United States, he formed the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM) in 1934 and galvanized the Nigerian youths for nationalism. The cannons of the Youth Charter adopted in 1937 centered on nationalism, inter-tribal harmony and a greater tomorrow. The Youth Movement became catalyst for championing Nigeria's independence from Britain. The return of Nnamdi Azikiwe from the United States in 1937 added more prominent Nigerians into the movement. Political career In the 1930s, Ita was a member of two movements in West Africa, the Youth movement and the Education movement. He was a member of the former with the establishment of the Nigerian Youth League in CalabarPhilip Serge Zachernuk, Colonial Subjects: An African Intelligentsia and Atlantic Ideas, University of Virginia Press, 2000, pp 107-108. . and he also campaigned vigorously for education as a tool of freeing the African mind and soul and liberating it from forces of political repression. He formed the Nigerian Youth Movement in 1934 which rapidly expanded with the addition of Nnamdi Azikiwe in 1938. He later became the proprietor of the West African People's Institute in Calabar. He joined the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) in the 1940s and was elected Vice President after the death of Herbert Macaulay, which saw Nnamdi Azikiwe emerging as the new leader of the party. Eyo Ita left NCNC to form the National Independence Party (NIP), which became one of the five Nigerian political parties that sent representatives to the July 27, 1953 London Conference on Nigerian Constitution. Some of his mentors were W. E. B. Du Bois and Edward Wilmot Blyden, who were notable Pan-Africanists of their eras. =National Independence Party= In 1946 the Richards Constitution which advanced a regional political framework for the country to enhance regional political and economic autonomy became law. The constitution was made law without the proper consultation of Nigerians, leading to Nnamdi Azikiwe and Eyo Ita opposing the regional political arrangement, while they presented a minority report of a federation of eight states. However, in 1951, the constitution was reviewed with minor changes to the original but opposed by Azikiwe. The major politicians of the time resorted to work within their ethnic and regional base as a foundation to gain political power, this led to regional politics and concentration of power in regional and federal ministers, who were largely nominated by the party and the regional House of Assemblies. In 1951, major elections were held in the Eastern region of Nigeria with Eyo Ita becoming leader of the Eastern government and Azikiwe, leader of opposition in the Western Regional Assembly, a potential obscure position in light of his national repute.Toyin Falola, Adebayo Oyebade. The Transformation of Nigeria: Essays in Honor of Toyin Falola, Africa World Press, 2002, pp. 96-97. A few federal ministers, however, from the NCNC supported a trial run of the Macpherson Constitution of 1951, in contravention of Azikiwe's view of opposition. The ministers had an ally in Eyo Ita. This led to internal wrangling, and a power struggle began, leading to the exit of some of the ministers and Eyo Ita.Rosalynde Ainslie, Catherine Hoskyns, Ronald Segal, Political Africa: A Who's Who of Personalities and Parties, Frederick A. Praeger, 1961, pp. 21-22. The new group later formed the National Independence Party, and Eyo Ita later became a member of the movement for the creation of the Calabar, Ogoja and Rivers State (COR State). He left the movement, however, and re-joined the NCNC in 1956.

The award is conferred annually by the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society and was first bestowed in 1964 in Tampa, Florida, U.S. Its namesake, aviation pioneer Tony Jannus (1889-October 12, 1916), piloted the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg‚ÄìTampa Airboat Line on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using heavier-than-air aircraft. In addition to preserving the legacy of Tony Jannus, the non-profit Society also offers financial assistance to college students pursuing studies in aviation and conducts an annual essay contest for high school students to encourage careers in aviation. Past recipients of the award include such famed luminaries as Eddie Rickenbacker, Donald Douglas, Jimmy Doolittle, C. R. Smith (the founder of American Airlines), William A. Patterson (president of United Airlines 1934-1966), and Chuck Yeager. Those so honored are enshrined at the St. Petersburg Museum of History's First Airline Pavilion. The Museum, located from the site of the inaugural flight's takeoff on January 1, 1914, also has an operational replica of the Benoist XIV airplane flown by Jannus that day. On January 29, 2011, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics dedicated an historic site plaque on the museum's grounds, commemorating the site of the world‚Äôs first regularly scheduled airline. History Tony Jannus was an early American pilot whose aerial exploits were widely publicized in aviation's pre-World War I period. He flew the first airplane from which a parachute jump was made, in 1912. Jannus was also the first airline pilot, having pioneered the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg‚ÄìTampa Airboat Line on January 1, 1914, the first scheduled commercial airline flight in the world using heavier-than-air aircraft. Departing from a location near the downtown St. Petersburg Municipal Pier on Second Avenue North, Jannus piloted the twenty-three-minute inaugural flight of the pioneer airline's Benoist XIV flying boat biplane. A crowd of 3,000 gathered at the pier to watch the history-making takeoff at 10 a.m. and were told by organizer Percival Fansler that \\"What was impossible yesterday is an accomplishment today, while tomorrow heralds the unbelieveable\\" . The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line over Tampa Bay, 1914 Occurring just ten years after Wilbur and Orville Wright's historic first airplane flight, the new St. Petersburg‚ÄìTampa Airboat Line began providing two daily round trips across Tampa Bay, departing St. Petersburg at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., with return flights from Tampa departing at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. At a fare of five dollars, it was the first time tickets were sold to the general public for point-to-point commercial air travel on a scheduled basis. Fifty years later, in 1963, James Hamlett and the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce created the Tony Jannus Award to recognize the \\"Man who has done the most to advance the airline industry\\" and to celebrate the Tampa Bay area's historic role in the development of commercial aviation. The following March 1964, Senator A. S. Mike Monroney was named the first Tony Jannus Award recipient for his work as chairman of the U.S. Senate's Aviation Subcommittee and as chief proponent of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 that created the Federal Aviation Administration. In the 1970s, the St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce joined with the Tampa chamber to co-sponsor the award. The joint effort by the two chambers of commerce eventually evolved into the Tony Jannus Distinguished Aviation Society, a non-profit organization which now confers the award. Recipients of the Tony Jannus Award Permanent exhibit at Tampa International Airport honoring recipients of the Tony Jannus Award Winners of the Tony Jannus Award are enshrined at the St. Petersburg Museum of History's First Airline Pavilion and Tony Jannus-related exhibits. The Museum, located from the site of the inaugural flight's takeoff on January 1, 1914, also has an operational replica of the Benoist XIV airplane flown by Jannus that day. The replica was built by the Florida Aviation Historical Society in 1983 and flown across Tampa Bay from St. Petersburg to Tampa on January 1, 1984, in a reenactment of the Jannus inaugural flight 70 years earlier. The replica was moved to the museum in January, 1993.

The theater company was founded in 1974 when eight Chicago artists, Cecil O'Neal, Warren Casey, Stuart Gordon, Cordis Heard, Roberta Maguire, Mac McGuinnes, June Pyskaƒçek, and David Rasche each fronted $1,000 to start a company outside the Chicago Loop and Gordon donated the light board of his Organic Theater Company. The theater's first production, The Velvet Rose, by Stacy Myatt premiered on October 9, 1974. Since 2011, Chay Yew has continued their mission as the Artistic Director. Clark Street, 1974 The company's initial home was the Northside Auditorium Building, 3730 N. Clark Street in Chicago, originally a Swedish social club. Its second production‚Äîa country-western musical co-produced with commercial producers called The Magnolia Club by Jeff Berkson, John Karraker and David Karraker‚Äîwas the company's first hit. Marcelle McVay was the first Managing Director. In 1975, director Dennis Zaƒçek staged The Caretaker by Harold Pinter, beginning a relationship that led to Zaƒçek being named artistic director in 1977. Key on- going collaborators worked with the company for the first time in the Clark Street space, including actor William L. Petersen, Marcelle McVay, director Sandy Shinner, and playwrights Steve Carter and Jeffrey Sweet. All of these people continue relationships with the company today. McVay, who is married to Dennis Zacek, subsequently became managing director and Sandy Shinner later became associate artistic director. Body Politic Theater, 1981 In 1981, the success of Sweet's third play with the company, Ties, led to it being transferred to an extended run in the larger space downstairs at the Body Politic Theater at 2257 N. Lincoln. When Ties closed, downstairs became Victory Gardens‚Äô new home. Upon the demise of the Body Politic company some years later, Victory Gardens acquired the whole building, housing four stages. In 1989, Zaƒçek's staging of James Sherman‚Äôs Beau Jest was such a hit that it moved for a long run off-Broadway and was subsequently staged in hundreds of productions around the world. In 2008, Sherman released a film version of the play starring Lainie Kazan and Seymour Cassel. In 1996, the Victory Gardens Playwrights Ensemble was created, a coming together of a diverse group of playwrights under a producing organization, virtually unheard of in American resident theaters. Founding members Steve Carter and James Sherman were joined by Claudia Allen, Dean Corrin, Lonnie Carter, Gloria Bond Clunie, John Logan, Nicholas Patricca, Douglas Post, Charles Smith, Jeffrey Sweet and Kristine Thatcher as the founding members of the company's Playwrights Ensemble. On June 3, 2001, Victory Gardens received the Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theatre. Winning the award made them one of five Chicago companies to be so honored the other four being the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, Goodman Theatre, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and Lookingglass Theatre Company. Move to Biograph Theatre, 2006 In 2006, Victory Gardens underwent a $11.8 million renovation and opened a re-designed Biograph Theater at 2433 N. Lincoln Avenue as its new home. The Biograph, the notorious location of the ambush of gangster John Dillinger, opened with a party hosted by William L. Petersen, who played Dillinger at Victory Gardens at the beginning of his career. The space at 2257 N. Lincoln has been redubbed the Victory Gardens Greenhouse and is mostly rented to a variety of non-profit companies including Shattered Globe and Remy Bumppo Theatre Company. In 2008 the Victory Gardens Greenhouse was sold to the Wendy and William Spatz Charitable Foundation. It is now the Greenhouse Theater Center. In 2010, Victory Gardens named the studio space at the Biograph Theater the Richard Christiansen Theatre in honor of longtime Chicago Tribune theatre critic Richard Christiansen, author of the book A Theatre of Our Own. Current Leadership with Chay Yew Chay Yew was named Artistic Director in 2011. Chay is joined by Erica Daniels, who acts as Managing Director of the company. Samuel D.

It is housed in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. In 1540, Cosimo I de' Medici and/or his wife, Eleanor of Toledo, commissioned this and other frescoes for Eleanor's private chapel. Three of the four walls of the small chapel found on the second floor of the palace are covered with works telling the story of Moses. Composition Bronzino. Standing Nude (study for The Crossing of the Red Sea). c. 1541. Uffizi Gallery. The large fresco is an example of Maniera art and is found on the south wall of the chapel. It is framed by fictive architectural elements including columns and an arch that provide the illusion the scene is contained in a lunette. The spandrels in the upper corners boast medallions and draperies to complete the illusion. The damage to the lower left corner is due to moisture. The fresco depicts three different scenes from the Old Testament. The three figures in the center foreground and three figures in the left foreground represent the Hebrew nation preparing to leave Egypt (). In the background, the Hebrews are shown safely completing their crossing of the Red Sea as Moses (shown in blue) gestures for the waters to return and drown the pursuing Egyptians (). In the right foreground, Moses, near the end of his life, is depicted laying his hand on Joshua and commissioning him to lead the Israelites (). Bronzino's arrangement of the Hebrews in the foreground demonstrates his mannerist penchant for appropriating classical sculptural subjects in his works. The seated nude on the right is shown in the classic reclining pose of a river god. The semi-nude male on the left with his back to the viewer contorts his body to grip the arm of a seated female while holding onto an oversized mazzocchio hat popular in 15th-century Florence. This is a coldly elegant and graceful gesture but its contribution to the narrative is unclear. Bronzino's study of a standing nude in the Uffizi was thought to be the work of Bronzino's teacher, Pontormo, until the 20th century. It is clearly a preparatory chalk drawing for the standing figure with the hat. His exaggerated thrust of the hip and raised arm are common mannerist motifs and one leg crossed behind the other is a signature pose of Bronzino's. The figure in the center leaning on a rock is shown with his legs similarly crossed. The standing figure's stance appears to be inspired by a Roman copy of a Greek bronze statue known as the Idolino. It was unearthed in a 1530 excavation at the Villa Imperiale of Pesaro where Bronzino was working at the time. Bronzino has replaced the gentle contrapposto of the ancient sculpture with a more artificial pose that is decorative and stylish. Pontormo passed on his inclination to imitate Michelangelo to his student Bronzino. This can clearly be seen by examining the outstretched arm of Moses as he prepares to lay his hand on the youthful Joshua. The gesture is taken directly from The Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel. Reflecting on these idealized yet emotionally detached figures taking their inspiration from previous work, art historian Arthur McComb wrote: The damage to the fresco has obliterated much of the scene portraying the Hebrews preparing to leave Egypt. An anonymous engraving based on Bronzino's work that was published by Hieronymus Cock shortly after the fresco was completed includes the missing details. If these details accurately represent Bronzino's work, the scene depicts the standing youth encouraging two nursing mothers to rise up and begin the exodus. At his feet sit another child and bundles of supplies for the journey. Based on this evidence, art historian Janet Cox-Rearick has suggested that the ornate silver urn and gold basin in the foreground represent the Egyptian treasure the Hebrews took with them as they hastily prepared to leave. In addition, the object the standing youth is holding on his head may not be an oversized hat but a package (perhaps of unleavened bread dough). The same youth holding the package on his head can be seen reaching the far shore in the background of the fresco. Symbolism and portraiture Detail of Strozzi coat of arms on banner amongst drowning Egyptians Detail of Pierfrancesco Riccio as the Old Testament priest, Eleazar This painting contains various allusions to the Medici's dynastic and political intentions. Moses can be equated to Cosimo I, who wants to lead his people to the promised land. The crossing of the Red Sea and the destruction of the Egyptian army alludes to the 1537 battle of Montemurlo where Cosimo I defeated the army trying to restore the Republic of Florence. The symbolism pointing to the battle isn't particularly subtle. A red Egyptian banner in the left background shows a portion of the coat of arms of the Strozzi family, one of the principal factions opposed to Medici rule. The appointment of Joshua by Moses refers to the birth in 1541 of Francesco, the son of Cosimo I and Eleanor and heir to the ducal state. This last allusion is strengthened by the pregnant woman portrayed behind Moses in the right foreground. Portraits of donors, political figures, and artists embedded in religious works were common in sixteenth-century Florence. It appears that the three men behind Moses in the right foreground are portraits. Only one has been positively identified. The man with the long dark beard portraying the priest Eleazar is Pierfrancesco Riccio who served as both Cosimo's secretary and a priest at the Florence Cathedral. The Florentine identities of the men in the red turban and the blue cap have not been established. It has also been posited that the man kneeling in front of Moses in the right foreground is Eleanor's father, Don Pedro de Toledo.

The ultratwister-design is that of a pipeline roller coaster, created by Japanese company TOGO. History Ultra Twister was previously located at Six Flags Great Adventure under the same name. It was built in 1985 and located at Six Flags Great Adventure's \\"Frontier Adventures\\" section along a path going from Rolling Thunder down to Runaway Mine Train. When it opened in 1986, it was the first heartline roll coaster in America as well as the coaster with the steepest ascent. Although the coaster itself was a rough ride due to the restraints needed to be in use, it was still a relatively popular coaster among guests. In 1989, the Great American Scream Machine opened at the park, bringing it up to six coasters. At that time, pictures and descriptions of this coaster-along with nine other coasters in the Six Flags Chain-were displayed on mini- billboards along the queue area. Ultra Twister was closed in the middle of the 1989 season and dismantled due to Six Flags's ride rotation program. It was moved to Six Flags AstroWorld, where it opened in 1990 and its lift hill was modified from a direct 90 degree vertical ascent to an ascent at a 45 degree angle so that it would be easier to evacuate the lift if necessary. The coaster was later changed from its bluish-white color scheme to green and blue, and would continue to run at AstroWorld until the park closed permanently at the end of the 2005 operating season on October 30, 2005. Subsequently, the coaster was dismantled and brought to Six Flags America in Largo, Maryland, where it was in storage. Its reopening is unlikely, as it is reportedly damaged beyond repair. In 2009, the ride was put up for sale on Ital International, though its entry has since been removed-either due to its sale, or because it failed to sell in a timely fashion. It was later removed from the park.

The school is situated in the neighbourhood of Laitumkhrah Shillong. History The school was established by the Congregation of Christian Brothers (India province) in Laitumkhrah, Shillong in 1916. The school is located in Laitumkhrah, Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya State. Set amongst the lush temperate forests of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills with its many waterfalls, Shillong was known as Scotland of the East during the British colonial period. The brotherhood was founded by Blessed Edmund Rice. The Christian Brothers were invited to Shillong in 1915 and St. Edmund‚Äôs College was begun in 1916. It was, however, in 1923 that the College was ready to start Inter-Arts and Inter-Science classes, and affiliation to the University of Calcutta, for these courses was received in 1923. The first classes of the University section of St. Edmund‚Äôs College opened in 1924. Bro. J. E. McCann was the first Principal of the College (he was also the Principal of the School at this time). Bro. I. O‚ÄôLeary was the first Principal of the College (separate from the School). From 1924 to 1936, St. Edmund‚Äôs College was junior college for Intermediate Arts and Science. At this level the college offered English, Alternative English, Latin, History, Maths, Geography, Physical Chemistry for arts and science respectively. The College celebrated its Platinum Jubilee in 1999. St. Edmund's School celebrated its Centenary Jubilee by starting with the opening ceremony on the 5th of June 2015 and its closing ceremony on the same date in 2016.

In the year 2018, there was also an excursion to Europe where iconic places in the United Kingdom, France and Spain were visited. Academics The school caters to not just subjects prescribed by the ICSE but also includes subjects like Moral Science. The Card System Until the 1990s the school maintained a system of class tests spanned across the academic year, in between regular term exams. These class tests were for different grades - green, blue, pink and yellow. The green cards were averaged based on high percentage while yellow denoted failure in one or more primary subjects. Unit Test Unit Tests are a regular feature. In 2015, with the new principal BR. Solomon Morris, the unit test is held two times each term. Term Exam The school usually has two terms exams a year, one in June and the other in the final week of November. Unlike card tests, which were conducted within classrooms, the term exams were more formal. Classes KG to 3 do not have term exams and their promotion is based mainly from class tests. Classes 4 usually have their exams in their classrooms, classes 5 and 6 have their exams in the classrooms of 6 .Classes 7-9 have their exams in different classrooms. From 1992 onward the ICSE pattern was changed, with the introduction of projects and later bifurcation of the syllabus. A typical class-X term exam had the following schedule: GROUP 1:( All listed subjects are compulsory) *English Literature *English Language *2nd Language (Khasi/Hindi) *History and Civics *Geography GROUP 2:( Students may choose any 2 subjects ) *Science (Individual papers for Physics, Chemistry and Biology) *Mathematics *Economics *Commercial Studies GROUP 3:(Application oriented subjects) In this group, students have to choose one subject which includes: *Computer Applications *Commercial Applications *Physical Education *Fashion Designing *Cookery Other subjects that are also taught includes: *3rd Language* is needed from class 5 to 8. *Art and Craft *Physical Training (P.T.) *Aerobics (till Class 6) *Music (till Class 5) *Life Skills *Value Education *Robotics For example, if a student takes his 2nd Language as Hindi, that means his 3rd Language will be Khasi.

It included an outdoor petting zoo, a walk-through log cabin, and a variety of scenery meant to create the atmosphere of a Western ranch. It was located in Frontierland, nearby Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. Inside one could find sheep, goats, cows, and other farm animals. Among these animals were the two turkeys who received presidential pardons in honor of Thanksgiving in 2008. The attraction was hosted by Brawny. Big Thunder Ranch closed permanently on January 11, 2016, as the attraction (and some nearby backstage areas) became the site of the land, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. History The idea for Big Thunder Ranch was originally conceived in 1984 by Dan Stark, who at that time was the Area Supervisor/Department Manager for the Circle D, the backstage area where the park's horses were housed. He thought that it would be a plus to use the open space where the old Mine Train Through Nature's Wonderland and the Pack Mules trekked was left vacant after Big Thunder Mountain Railroad opened. There was a need for some additional paddock space to rest horses. So, one of the considerations was that the horses could also be seen from the Disneyland Railroad which made for a good show component The other consideration was accessibility to that area as the old trail that the Pack Mules used to get up and over the railroad tracks safely for the animals and staff was still in good shape and it was adjacent to the area open space. After some early conversations with Kim Irvine, the onsite Walt Disney Imagineering manager, and a mention about this idea when the new company CEO & COO, Michael Eisner and Frank Wells, were spending two days visiting all areas of the park, the project was given a provisional go-ahead. Subsequently, architect Chris Carradine was tasked by Walt Disney Imagineering to develop the initial attraction plans. The attraction opened in 1986. It housed the Big Thunder log cabin, a building constructed with real logs provided by the Rocky Mountain Log Company. The cabin was initially intended as a replica to simply be looked at by visitors, but it was later used as a gift store and finally as a children's crafts center. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the building, and building designer Bob Ybarra drew the plans. Care was taken to use real materials and hide modern structural hardware to make the cabin look as authentic as possible. The cabin was accompanied by a petting zoo and a dining area known as the Big Thunder Barbecue. Eventually, the petting zoo was removed to make room for an outdoor theater that served as a home for a live show themed to Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame titled Festival of Fools beginning in June 1996.http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID500110.asp The show ended in April 1998; The Ranch hosted the Billy Hill and the Hillbillies show after they left the Golden Horseshoe Saloon until they left Disneyland on January 6, 2014 and moved to Knott's Berry Farm. After being used on occasion for special events and seasonal attractions for several years, the outdoor dining area reopened in spring 2009, serving seasonal confections and an all- you-can-eat American-style barbecue menu, including chicken, pork, sausage, beans, corncob, cornbread, coleslaw, lemonade and fruit cobbler. Musicians performed traditional American country and folklore sing-along on the stage and interacted with diners. The log cabin was called \\"Miss Chris' Cabin\\" and had two large tables stocked with baskets of crayons and coloring pages. In an area unseen by guests inside the Ranch premises existed a hidden trail lined with path lights and towering trees used for access of the horses seen around the park, from the backstage stables to the on stage areas. At the other end of the trail was the only actual house built on the resort that was occupied by the caretakers of the Equestrians. =Decorations= The entire ranch rotated through seasonal-appropriate decorations: *Summertime Roundup decorations featured summer flowers, eagles, and red/white/blue color motifs. *Autumntime Roundup decorations featured fall flowers, carved pumpkins, and orange/brown/yellow color motifs. *Wintertime Roundup decorations featured winter flowers, snow, and red/green/blue color motifs. *Springtime Roundup decorations featured spring flowers, baby animals, and purple/yellow/green color motifs. Big Thunder Ranch often hosted seasonal and holiday-themed shows, including Woody's All-American Roundup during Fourth of July events, Woody's Halloween Roundup during Halloween events, and Santa's Reindeer Roundup during Christmas events.

Upon completion in 1899, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet where she helped to escort a royal yacht during its cruise through the Mediterranean Sea. After a refit, she was assigned to the China Station in 1904 and returned home three years later to be reduced to reserve. Andromeda was converted into a training ship in 1913 and remained in that role under various names until 1956. That year she was sold for scrap and broken up in Belgium, the last Pembroke-built ship still afloat. Design and description The Diadem class was designed to protect British merchant shipping from fast cruisers like the Russian and were smaller versions of the . The ships had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of . They displaced . The first batch of Diadems were powered by a pair of four-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by 30 Belleville boilers. They carried a maximum of of coal and their hulls were sheathed with copper to reduce biofouling. Their complement numbered 677 officers and ratings. The main armament of the Diadem-class ships consisted of 16 quick-firing (QF) QF guns. Four of these were on the forecastle and in the stern, all protected by gun shields. The remaining dozen guns were in armoured casemates on each broadside. The ships carried 200 rounds per gun. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by a dozen QF 12-pounder , 12-cwt guns, for which 300 rounds per gun was provided, and 3 QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. In addition, the ships carried a pair of Ordnance QF 12-pounder 8-cwt landing guns for use ashore. The ships were also armed with a pair of submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. The sloped armoured deck ranged in thickness from on the flat and slopes, respectively. The casemates were protected by 6 inches of Harvey armour while the gun shields had of armour. The conning towers were protected by walls and their roofs were 2 inches thick. The tubes protecting the ammunition hoists were also 2 inches thick. Construction and career Andromeda was the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy and was laid down on 2 December 1895 by Pembroke Dockyard. The ship was launched on 30 April 1897 by Lady Scourfield, wife of Sir Owen Scourfield Bt. She was fitted out at Pembroke Dock until 5 September 1898 and sailed later that month to Portsmouth Dockyard for completion. Upon completion on 5 September 1899, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Captain John Burr. In March 1900 she did a month's cruise of Italian and Spanish ports. Captain Francis Foley was appointed in command on 12 March 1901. That month the ship was one of two cruisers tasked to escort the ocean liner , commissioned as a royal yacht for the world tour of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George and Queen Mary), from Gibraltar to Malta, and then to Port Said. Captain Christopher Cradock was appointed in command on 24 March 1902, and from 11 June that year Andromeda served as flagship to Rear-Admiral Sir Baldwin Wake Walker, commander of the Cruiser Division of the Mediterranean Fleet. In May 1902 she visited Palermo to attend festivities in connection with the opening of an Agricultural Exhibition by King Victor Emmanuel, and the following month the ship was in Gibraltar for a coronation f√™te. Andromeda and other ships of the division visited Argostoli in early October 1902. Andromeda returned home later that year and began a lengthy refit. She was assigned to the China Station in 1904 and returned home three years later. The ship was reduced to reserve at Chatham Dockyard upon her return, but transferred to Devonport Dockyard shortly afterwards. Andromeda was assigned to the 9th Cruiser Squadron of the new reserve Third Fleet in 1912. The following year the ship was converted to a boys' training ship and renamed Powerful II on 23 September 1913. She was later renamed Impregnable II in November 1919 and finally, HMS Defiance on 20 January 1931, when she became part of the torpedo school. The ship was sold for scrap in 1956 and arrived at Burgt, Belgium, on 14 August to begin demolition.

The ship, a Cactus- or A-class tender, was built in Duluth, Minnesota by the Zenith Dredge Company, laid down on 2 February 1942, launched on 3 July 1942, and commissioned on 17 November 1942, as Woodbine (WAGL-289). Service history =Atlantic coast, 1942‚Äì1944= Woodbine was assigned to Norfolk, Virginia for general aids-to-navigation (ATON) duties, but did not arrive at her post until 5 February 1943, being delayed by several unscheduled ice- breaking operations. On 20 September 1943, she was transferred to San Juan, Puerto Rico for aids-to-navigation and law enforcement duties, inspecting vessels suspected of drug trafficking. =World War II, 1944‚Äì1945= On 15 January 1944, she sailed from Puerto Rico to Portsmouth Navy Yard for refitting, then sailed to San Francisco, where she was stationed from 7 March 1944. Woodbine was then deployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations to take part in the amphibious assault on the Marianas Islands, and served as a mobile service base for the U.S. Navy's Southern Attack force during the attack on Guam, before taking part in the Okinawa campaign in 1945. =Lake Michigan, 1947‚Äì1972= At the end of the war Woodbine returned to the United States, and from 19 September 1947, was stationed in Grand Haven, Michigan, where she remained for the rest of her career. On 19 April 1965 she was slightly damaged in a collision with MV Meteor while ice-breaking off Green Bay, Wisconsin. I was a seaman aboard the Woodbine when we had the collision. It was a Sunday afternoon around 3:00 pm. From 18 to 20 August 1965, she was involved in recovering debris from United Airlines Flight 389 which had crashed into Lake Michigan. Also in 1965 her designation was changed from WAGL (which was a US Navy designation denoting an auxiliary vessel, lighthouse tender) to WLB. On 6 January 1971, she was deployed to search for the crew of an Air Force B-52 bomber that crashed in upper Lake Michigan, near Charlevoix. There were no survivors. last photo =1972‚Äì2012= On 15 February 1972, as part of a government-wide savings plan, Woodbine was decommissioned and donated to the Cleveland Public School System through the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare/CSA to be used as a training ship in marine engineering and electronics. In the early 1980s, she was sold to a private owner at the cost of $150,000. Sometime Prior to 1992, Woodbine was modified and used as a mobile fish processing ship in Alaska for the Woodbine Alaska Fishing Company (WAFCO), where she was working around 2007. The buoy deck was enclosed and used as a processing floor with 4 large freezers. On the stern a galley was built and the whole deck aft of the wheelhouse was enclosed to shelter the cardboard used to pack frozen fish in. The forward deck was outfitted with multiple holding tanks for fish waiting to be processed. It is believed that Woodbine was sold for scrap around 2012.

This layout is typically chosen for better control on many surfaces, and is an important part of rally racing, as well as off- road driving. Most four-wheel-drive layouts are front-engined and are derivatives of earlier front-engine, rear-wheel drive, or front-engine, front- wheel drive designs. The 1903 Spyker 60 HP was the first car built with an F4 drive layout. This layout is also the drive train of choice for off-road pickup trucks and SUVs. It allows these vehicles to get the most traction without sacrificing cargo or passenger room. Part-time four-wheel drive vehicles frequently have a transfer case and no center differential, meaning the 4WD mode does not allow any difference in front and rear axle speeds. For normal road driving, these vehicles are shifted into 2WD mode, to prevent damage to the transfer case. Full-time four-wheel drive systems, on the other hand, cannot do without some kind of center differential.

The route runs from U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Marcus Hook north to PA 352 in Lima. The route runs through suburban areas, passing through Linwood and Aston Township. PA 452 intersects Interstate 95 (I-95) and US 322 in Upper Chichester Township and US 1 in Lima. PA 452 was first designated by 1928 between its current termini. A portion of the route in Aston Township was realigned by 1950. Route description PA 452 northbound past US 1 in Middletown TownshipPA 452 begins at an intersection with US 13 in the borough of Marcus Hook in Delaware County, heading north-northwest on two-lane undivided Market Street. South of this intersection, Market Street continues as an unnumbered road toward the Delaware River. From US 13, the route passes businesses before coming to a bridge over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor near the Marcus Hook station serving SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line. Past this bridge, the road enters Lower Chichester Township, passing a mix of homes and businesses before heading into residential areas in the community of Linwood. Upon crossing Laughead Avenue, PA 452 heads into Upper Chichester Township and runs north past more homes to the west, widening into a four-lane divided highway as it crosses Marcus Hook Creek and comes to an interchange with I-95. Past this interchange, the route heads into commercial areas, narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road and coming to a bridge over CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. A short distance further north, the road comes to an interchange with US 322. Following this, PA 452 passes a mix of homes and businesses, crossing into Aston Township. Here, the route becomes Pennell Road and passes between a shopping center to the west and an industrial park to the east before continuing past businesses with some nearby residential areas as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road curves north-northwest near more development, narrowing back to two lanes, and heads north into wooded areas. PA 452 continues to wind north through woodland with some residential and commercial development, running a short distance to the west of Chester Creek. The route passes under the abandoned Chester Creek Branch railroad line before it turns northwest and crosses the creek into Middletown Township. Here, it runs near some development in the community of Glen Riddle before curving north and coming to a bridge over SEPTA's West Chester Branch near the former Glen Riddle station. The road heads north through wooded residential areas, continuing to an intersection with US 1 (Baltimore Pike) in a commercial area. Past this junction, PA 452 heads past homes in the community of Lima, reaching its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 352. Barren Road continues northeast from this intersection as State Route 4004, an unsigned quadrant route. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the current alignment of PA 452 was not legislated as part of a route. PA 452 was first designated by 1928 to run from US 13/PA 91 in Marcus Hook north to PA 352 in Lima. By 1950, a portion of PA 452 was realigned in Aston Township, with the former alignment becoming Old Pennell Road. Also by this time, an interchange was constructed with the new alignment of US 322 in Upper Chichester Township. PA 452 had previously intersected US 322 at an at-grade intersection with Concord Road (which carried US 322) in Aston Township. During the 1960s, an interchange was built with the newly constructed I-95 in Upper Chichester Township.

It takes its name from the River Cover, a tributary of the River Ure. The dale runs south-west from the eastern end of Wensleydale to the dale head at a pass, known as Park Rash Pass,Yorkshire Dales National Park website: Kettlewell between Great Whernside to the south and Buckden Pike to the north. It is accessible by a single track road, which runs the length of the dale and over the pass to Kettlewell in Wharfedale. Speight suggests that the name derives from the Anglo-Saxon Cofa-Dal which means Cave-Dale (in part due to the many caverns in the dale) or it may derive from Kofur which means Arrow; an allusion to the swiftness of the water in the dale. History An abbey was founded at Coverham in the 14th century by Ralph, son of Robert Lord of Middleham. The order that it belonged to was Premonstratensian (or White Canons) and was formally dissolved in 1536. Whilst some of the ruins are still extant, it is not open to the general public. In the 18th century, the road through Coverdale from Kettlewell to Middleham was used as the route of coaches between London and Richmond. The route came north through Halifax, Keighley, Skipton and Cracoe as part of its journey. The valley gives its name to a variant of Yorkshire Dales cheese, produced at the Wensleydale Creamery in Hawes. Coverdale cheese is of the same general texture and flavour as Wensleydale, but thought by some to be slightly sourer and therefore possessing greater 'edge'. The River Cover meets its confluence with the River Ure at the hamlet of Coverbridge which consists of Clarkson's farm and the Coverbridge Pub, an ancient travellers inn on the road from Jervaux Abbey to Middleham. The Coverbridge Pub has at least two claims to fame including having been the hiding place of monks who kept alive the recipe of Wensleydale cheese during the sacking of Jervaux Abbey by troops loyal to King Henry VIII, and, the scene of the first formally recorded game of cricket in 1706. In 2006 the Coverbridge Cricket Festival celebrated the 300th anniversary in a massive spectacle of cricket supported by the Red Arrows and a spitfire and Hurricane of the RAF with musical support provided by the band of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

Early years He was born in London, England, the son of the Telegraph's crime correspondent C. A. Coughlin. The eldest of four children (his younger brother is Vincent Coughlin QC), he grew up in Upminster, Essex. Raised as a Catholic, at the age of 11 he won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital, and at 18 gained a scholarship to read Modern History at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he specialised in the Industrial Revolution under the tutelage of the historian Simon Schama. Journalistic career Coughlin interviewing Mike Pompeo in May 2019 In August 1977 Coughlin joined the Thomson Regional Newspapers graduate trainee course and after undertaking his initial training in Cardiff served out his indentures as a trainee reporter with the Reading Evening Post. In November 1980 Coughlin joined The Daily Telegraph as a general news reporter. Coughlin has spent most of his journalistic career working for what is now the Telegraph Media Group. As a young reporter for his newspaper, he was initially given responsibility for covering a number of major crime stories, such as the arrest of Peter Sutcliffe (dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper) and the Brixton riots. Becoming a foreign correspondent, his first big assignment was to cover the American invasion of Grenada in late 1983. From there he was sent to Beirut during the Lebanese civil war where he developed his interest in the Middle East and international terrorism. After the Telegraph group was bought in 1985 by the Canadian businessman Conrad Black, Coughlin was appointed The Daily Telegraphs Middle East correspondent by Max Hastings, the newspaper's new editor. Coughlin opened the newspaper's bureau in Jerusalem, and spent the next three years covering a multitude of stories throughout the region. In April 1986 he narrowly escaped being kidnapped by Hezbollah fighters in Beirut, the day before another British journalist John McCarthy was kidnapped. In March 2009 Coughlin recalled this experience in My Alter Ego, a programme for BBC Radio 4. In 1989 Coughlin returned to London, where he transferred to The Sunday Telegraph and was appointed the newspaper's chief foreign correspondent. During the next few years he received several promotions, becoming Foreign Editor in 1997 and Executive Editor in 1999. The following year The Sunday Telegraph won the prestigious \\"newspaper of the year\\" award at the British Press Awards. He has appeared as a foreign-affairs analyst on the American networks CNN, Fox News, CBS, ABC and MSNBC and NBC. In Britain he broadcasts regularly for the BBC and Sky News. In 2006 Coughlin rejoined The Daily Telegraph as the newspaper's Defence and Security Editor after a brief spell writing for the Daily Mail, and later that year was promoted to the post of Executive Foreign Editor. He writes a weekly column, \\"Inside Abroad\\", and comments on a broad range of subjects, with a special interest in defence and security issues, the Middle East and international terrorism. He maintains a blog for the Telegraph's website. Author Coughlin is the author of several books. His first book was Hostage: The Complete Story of the Lebanon Captives (Little, Brown 1992), which was followed by a study of the politics of modern Jerusalem, A Golden Basin Full of Scorpions which was BBC correspondent John Simpson's \\"book of the year\\" and was described as \\"excellent, a brilliant book\\" by the author A. N. Wilson. In 2002 Coughlin published a biography of Saddam Hussein. The American edition, Saddam: King of Terror (ECCO) was a New York Times best-seller in 2003, and received international critical acclaim. His next book, American Ally: Tony Blair and the War on Terror (ECCO, 2006) was nominated Kirkus Reviews books of the year. In 2009 Coughlin published Khomeini‚Äôs Ghost (Macmillan, London, and ECCO, New York City) a study of the life of Ayatollah Khomeini and his impact on the radicalisation of the Islamic world during the previous thirty years. Historian Dominic Sandbrook, reviewing Khomeini's Ghost in The Observer, wrote: \\"Readers already familiar with recent Iranian history will not discover much new information in Coughlin's account, but it nevertheless makes a very readable and entertaining introduction to a nation badly misunderstood in the west. And while Coughlin makes no secret of his deep antipathy to the Iranian government, his treatment of its founder is satisfyingly nuanced\\".Dominic Sandbrook \\"As powerful in death as in life\\", The Observer, 15 February 2009, retrieved 12 May 2009.

The original story followed a lunch given by Malcolm Rifkind, then Foreign Secretary, at which editor Charles Moore and colleagues were present, and later briefings given to Coughlin by MI6 agents who had insisted on the preservation of their anonymity.Vikram Dodd \\"Profiles: Saif Gadafy vs Con Coughlin\\", The Guardian, 19 April 2002 After a hearing at the Court of Appeal in October 1998, it was established that the journalists had a right to bring the story before the public under the Qualified privilege, under the Reynold's Defence rules established by an earlier case, Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd the previous July.David Hooper Reputations Under Fire, London: Little, Brown, 2000, p.341 The main court case followed in 2002, which was defended by the Telegraph Group and was eventually settled out of court without any damages being paid, and with both sides agreeing to pay their own costs. In 2002 Geoffrey Robertson QC made a statement on behalf of the Telegraph Group stating \\"there was no truth in the allegation that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi participated in any currency sting\\". =Habbush letter= In late 2003, in a front-page exclusive story, Coughlin revealed a leaked intelligence memorandum, purportedly uncovered by Iraq's interim government, which detailed a meeting between Mohamed Atta, one of the 11 September hijackers, and Iraqi intelligence at the time of Saddam Hussein.Coughlin, Con. Terrorist behind September 11 strike was trained by Saddam The Daily Telegraph. 13 December 2003Coughlin, Con. Does this link Saddam to 9/11? The Daily Telegraph. 13 December 2003 The memo was supposedly written by Iraqi security chief General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti to the president of Iraq. The report was subsequently challenged with American officials also reiterating that there was no such link. The Daily Telegraph's report was repeated by several conservative columnists in the United States, including Deroy MurdockMurdock, Deroy. On the Interrogation List National Review. 15 December 2003 and William Safire.Safire, William. From the 'Spider Hole' The New York Times. 15 December 2003 =Turkey= Coughlin alleged that the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, has negotiated a deal with Iran for Tehran to make a $25 million contribution to the campaign funds of Turkey's ruling party. Immediately after the publication of the article, Turkish Government rebutted all allegations and asked the newspaper to remove Coughlin's article from its website. Justice and Development Party also demanded an apology for publishing what it called an article without any sources but with many lies in it. The Daily Telegraph lost the libel lawsuitErdogan wins damages for Iran claim Erdoƒüan filed in UK. As a result, he won \\"a substantial sum\\" in libel damages and an apology was published by the newspaper. Views on civil liberties of terrorist suspects In April 2009, Coughlin wrote an article entitled \\"My advice to Obama: Don't pick a fight with Dick Cheney\\", which was published on the Telegraph's website. In the article, which followed claims that US forces had waterboarded an Al Qaeda suspect 183 times, Coughlin argued that: \\"There are always two sides to a story, even a deeply unpleasant one such as waterboarding an al-Qaeda suspect\\", before asking \\"what if, as Mr Cheney is now suggesting, these brutal interrogation methods actually produced information that saved lives by thwarting potential al-Qaeda attacks?\\". Coughlin suggested that the problem posed \\"an interesting ethical dilemma\\", namely: \\"Are interrogation methods like waterboarding justified if they save lives, or should we respect the detainees' human rights, thereby enabling the terror attacks to take place and claim innocent lives? I know which option I'd go for\\".Con Coughlin, \\"My advice to Obama: Don't pick a fight with Dick Cheney\\" Daily Telegraph blogs, April 21, 2009 Coughlin has persisted in writing articles supporting the use of torture, for example on 10 February 2010 \\"When the next bomb goes off in London, blame the judges\\".Con Coughlin, \\"When the next bomb goes off in London, blame the judges\\" Daily Telegraph blogs, February 10, 2010/ Views on China In March 2020, Couglin wrote a column in The Daily Telegraph accusing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of being a corrupt elite that has no interest in protecting the interests of its citizens, nor those of the world beyond, desperate not to be held accountable for causing a disaster of truly catastrophic proportions.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/25/china- cannot-escape-blame-wuhan-flu/ In April 2020, he wrote in another column suggesting readers should treat China like a hostile state due to the deliberate lack of transparency and cooperation that has characterized the CCP response, and its reprehensible behavior by launching a disinformation campaign that seeks to portray China as the victim, rather than being the instigator of a global health crisis.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/01/coronavirus-means-must- now-treat-china-like-hostile-state/ References Category:1955 births Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:The Daily Telegraph people Category:English male journalists Category:English newspaper editors Category:Living people Category:People educated at Christ's Hospital Category:People from Upminster ","title":"Con Coughlin"},{"id":"11851847","text":"The Brittany American Cemetery and Memorial is located in Saint-James, Normandy, France, near the northeastern edge of Brittany. It contains the remains of 4,410 of World War II American soldiers, most of whom lost their lives in the Normandy and Brittany campaigns of 1944. Along the retaining wall of the memorial terrace are inscribed the names of 498 of the missing. Rosettes mark the names of soldiers whose remains have been identified.American Battle Monuments Commission ‚Äì Brittany American Cemetery and Memorial History The Brittany American Cemetery, in extent, lies among the hedgerows in rolling farm country in Normandy near the border with Brittany in France. It is one of fourteen permanent American World War II military cemetery memorials erected by the American Battle Monuments Commission on foreign soil. The site was liberated on 2 August 1944 by the 8th Infantry Division; a temporary military cemetery was established on it three days later. After the war, when the temporary cemeteries were being disestablished by the American Graves Registration Service, the remains of American military dead whose next of kin had requested interment on foreign soil were moved from the temporary cemeteries to one of the permanent cemetery sites, usually the one closest to the temporary location. The 4,410 American military dead buried in the Brittany American Cemetery lost their lives in the area of northwestern France extending from the beachhead westward to Brest and eastward to the Seine and represent 43 percent of the burials originally made in the region. They were interred there by the American Graves Registration Service in the distinctive grave patterns proposed by the cemetery's architect and approved by this Commission. Most of them died in the fighting in and around Saint-L√¥. The design and construction of all cemetery facilities in the permanent World War I and II cemeteries, were the responsibility of the American Battle Monuments Commission (i.e., the memorial, chapel, visitors' building, superintendent's quarters, service facilities and paths, roads and walls). The Commission was also responsible for the sculpture, landscaping and other improvements. Construction of the permanent cemetery memorial at Brittany was completed in 1956. Memorial Chapel The Memorial Chapel consists of an antechamber and tower, museum room and chancel. Typical of the ecclesiastical architecture of the region, it is Romanesque in design. The exterior of the memorial is constructed of local La Pyrie granite. At its east end is a sculpture group. \\"Youth Triumphing Over Evil\\" designed by Lee Lawrie of Easton, Maryland and executed in Chauvigny limestone from the Poitiers region by Jean Juge of Paris. Carved in its granite base is the inscription: Over the entrance door is a sculpture group, also designed by Lee Lawrie and executed by Jean Juge, consisting of an eagle, shield, stars, laurel and arrows representing the Great Seal of the United States; the shield is flanked by two floating angels representing victory. The one to the left of the observer, wearing the Columbian cap, is in mourning. She holds in her right hand the laurel of the brave, and in her left hand the palm of sacrifice. The figure to the right is a triumphant Victory, clothed in mail and wearing a helmet. Her right hand holds a sword, her left hand a trumpet. Below the sculpture over the tympanum is the inscription: Burial area There are 4,410 American military personnel buried in the cemetery. Their 4,408 headstones are set in 16 fan-shaped plots, curving from the central mall. The dead came from every state in the Union, the District of Columbia and Canada. Ninety-five of the headstones mark graves of \\"unknowns;\\" two of these graves contain the remains of two Unknowns that could not be separated. In twenty instances, two brothers are buried side by side. Among those buried in the cemetery are two Medal of Honor recipients, Sherwood H. Hallman and Ernest W. Prussman. American film actor Richard Fiske (born Thomas Potts) is buried there too.Three Stooges FAQ At the far (east) end of the mall is a rectangular stone cenotaph of LaPyrie granite designed by Lee Lawrie and executed by the French sculptor, Augustine Beggi.

Background He was bred by American businessman John McNamee Sullivan and was raced by HH Aga Khan IV. A descendant of Nearco, Blushing Groom was sired by Red God and out of the mare Runaway Bride. He was trained by Fran√ßois Mathet in France. Racing record Blushing Groom raced six times in 1976 at age two. He finished third in his debut, then won the next five races, including four Group One events, capturing the Prix Robert Papin, Prix Morny, Prix de la Salamandre, and Grand Crit√©rium. His performances earned him French Champion Two-Year-Old honors. As a three-year-old, Blushing Groom extended his win streak to seven, winning the 1977 Prix de Fontainebleau and the GI Poule d'Essai des Poulains. Sent to England to compete in The Derby, he faced a 1¬Ω mile challenge, a distance fifty percent longer than he had ever run before. He finished third to winner The Minstrel, a son of Northern Dancer. In his final race, Blushing Groom finished second in France's GI Prix Jacques Le Marois. Stud record Although Blushing Groom met with considerable success in racing, he became an even greater as a sire. He was sent to stand at stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, where he sired winners at major tracks in Europe, North America, Australia, Japan, and Hong Kong. Like his sire Red God, Blushing Groom had been a champion miler but many of his offspring are renowned for their stamina and have been able to win consistently at longer distances. Blushing Groom has sired 92 stakes winners.

To form a knowledge space, one models a domain of knowledge as a set of concepts, and a feasible state of knowledge as a subset of that set containing the concepts known or knowable by some individual. Typically, not all subsets are feasible, due to prerequisite relations among the concepts. The knowledge space is the family of all the feasible subsets. Knowledge spaces were introduced in 1985 by Jean-Paul Doignon and Jean-Claude Falmagne. and have since been studied by many other researchers..A bibliography on knowledge spaces maintained by Cord Hockemeyer contains over 400 publications on the subject. They also form the basis for two computerized tutoring systems, RATH (defunct now) and ALEKS.Introduction to Knowledge Spaces: Theory and Applications, Christof K√∂rner, Gudrun Wesiak, and Cord Hockemeyer, 1999 and 2001. It is possible to interpret a knowledge space as a special form of a restricted latent class model.. Origin Knowledge Space Theory (KST) was motivated by the shortcomings of the psychometric approach to the assessment of competence like SAT and ACT. The theory was developed with an objective of designing automated procedures which - *accurately assess the knowledge of a student, and *efficiently provide advices for further study. Assessments based on KST are adaptive and can account for possible slips or guesses. KST aims to give a detailed assessment of student's knowledge state as opposed to a numerical mark in traditional assessments. More specifically, the result of a KST based assessment tells two things - *What the student can do and *What the student is ready to learn. Basic concepts *Knowledge State :It is the complete set of problems that an individual is capable of solving in a particular topic (such as Algebra). *Precedence Relation :It is the parent-child relationship between concepts. It captures the inter-dependency of concepts (prerequisite relationships). *Knowledge Structure :It is the set of all feasible knowledge states. Because of precedence relations some of the knowledge states are infeasible. *The outer and inner fringes :The unique items between a knowledge state and its immediate successor knowledge state is called the original knowledge state's Outer fringe. It basically tells the items that the student is ready to learn. Conversely, Inner fringe is the items that differentiate a knowledge state from its immediate predecessor. Inner fringe tells the items that the student has already learned. Definitions Some basic definitions used in the knowledge space approach - *A tuple (Q, K) consisting of a non- empty set Q and a set K of subsets from Q is called a knowledge structure if K contains the empty set and Q. *A knowledge structure is called a knowledge space if it is closed under union, i.e. \\\\cup F \\\\in K whenever F \\\\subseteq K . *A knowledge space is called a quasi-ordinal knowledge space if it is in addition closed under intersection, i.e. if S, T \\\\in K implies S\\\\cap T \\\\in K. Closure under both unions and intersections gives (Q,‚à™,‚à©) the structure of a distributive lattice; Birkhoff's representation theorem for distributive lattices shows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all quasiorders on Q and the set of all quasi-ordinal knowledge spaces on Q. I.e., each quasi-ordinal knowledge space can be represented by a quasi-order and vice versa. An important subclass of knowledge spaces, the well-graded knowledge spaces or learning spaces, can be defined as satisfying two additional mathematical axioms: # If S and T are both feasible subsets of concepts, then S\\\\cup T is also feasible. In educational terms: if it is possible for someone to know all the concepts in S, and someone else to know all the concepts in T, then we can posit the potential existence of a third person who combines the knowledge of both people. # If S is a nonempty feasible subset of concepts, then there is some concept x in S such that S\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\} is also feasible. In educational terms: any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning one concept at a time, for a finite set of concepts to be learned. A set family satisfying these two axioms forms a mathematical structure known as an antimatroid. Construction of knowledge spaces In practice, there exist several methods to construct knowledge spaces. The most frequently used method is querying experts. There exist several querying algorithms that allow one or several experts to construct a knowledge space by answering a sequence of simple questions... Another method is to construct the knowledge space by explorative data analysis (for example by Item tree analysis) from data. A third method is to derive the knowledge space from an analysis of the problem solving processes in the corresponding domain.

His influence seems to have extended beyond his own village to all those along the Wabash River. George Rogers Clark, in his memoir, refers to him as \\"Tobacco's Son\\", and British Lt- Governor Henry Hamilton's journal often refers to \\"Old Tobacco and his son.\\" The relationship of the two chiefs, Old Tobacco and Young Tobacco, seems probable but is not certain. It may be that the British and Americans presumed Piankesaw leadership passed from father to son, but this was not common among Miami tribes. Clark's memoir describes Young Tobacco as being very dedicated towards the American cause, declaring himself to be a \\"big knife\\". When Hamilton recaptures Vincennes and occupies Fort Sackville with the American prisoner Captain Helm, Young Tobacco declares openly that Helm is his brother, and voluntarily imprisons himself to stay with Helm. Knowing the influence of Young Tobacco among the area natives, Hamilton offers him several gifts to regain his favor, which Tobacco accepts for himself and his brother (Helm) to use. As Clark and his army nears Vincennes to recapture it, Young Tobacco musteres a large band of native warriors and requests permission to join Clark's army. This offer is declined, but Tobacco continues to favor the Americans during the siege of Fort Sackville. Hamilton's journal offers a contrasting view of Young Tobacco. Rather than being an open supporter of the Americans, Young Tobacco seems to favor whoever is in power at the time. He offers excuses to Hamilton for his lack of loyalty when the residents of Vincennes first rebelled in favor of the Americans. In a war council meeting, Young Tobacco blames this on other chiefs for not coming to his support, and declares that he was too weak to resist the Americans and too young to make such decisions on his own. Hamilton seems suspicious of Young Tobacco in his journal, but does not describe any open acts of resistance to British authority. After the Americans had secured Vincennes, they had trouble with Delaware along the White River. Clark ordered a punitive expedition against them, and Young Tobacco brokered a peace deal, accepting responsibility for future Delaware raids but promising retaliation if they again attacked Americans. Clark says that Young Tobacco died two years after the battle for Fort Sackville, and was carried to Kaskaskia and buried with military honors.

It was last active in June 2010 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, where it was a component of Air Force Material Command. During World War II, as the 312th Bombardment Group, it operated primarily in the Southwest Pacific Theater as an A-20 Havoc light bomber unit assigned to Fifth Air Force. The group also flew the B-32 Dominator on several evaluation combat missions at the end of the war. It was awarded both the Distinguished Unit Citation and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for its combat service in New Guinea; the Western Pacific; Leyte, and Luzon. History : see: 312th Aeronautical Systems Wing for related lineage and history =World War II= The 312th Bombardment Group was activated on 15 March 1942 at Bowman Field (Fort Knox) Kentucky. It was redesignated 312th Bombardment Group (Dive) in July 1942 and trained in the United States for several months with Douglas A-24 Banshee, Vultee V-72, North American A-36 Apache, and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft. The unit was deployed to the Southwest Pacific, October‚ÄìDecember 1943, and assigned to Fifth Air Force. It was again redesignated as the 312th Bombardment Group (Light) in December 1943. It began operations in New Guinea, flying patrol and escort missions. Following its conversion to the Douglas A-20 Havoc, the group attacked airfields, troop concentrations, gun positions, bridges, and warehouses on the northern and western coasts of New Guinea. It moved to the Philippines in November 1944 and provided support for ground troops and struck airfields and transportation facilities. The 312th received a Distinguished Unit Citation for actions against Japanese butanol plants in Formosa, 25 March ‚Äì 4 April 1945. Consolidated B-32 Dominator The 312th was selected to carry out field operation testing of the Consolidated B-32 Dominator in mid-1945 and made test flights over Luzon and Formosa in June 1945. The B-32 had been in development since before World War II, but a protracted development period delayed production versions of the aircraft until 1945. The first two B-32s arrived on Luzon on 2 May, with a third aircraft arriving the next day. The first combat mission took place on 29 May 1945. It was a strike against a Japanese supply depot in Luzon's Cayagan Valley. All three of the Dominators were to take part, but one aborted on takeoff. The other two proceeded to the target. There was no enemy opposition, and bombing runs were made from an altitude of 10,000 feet, and both aircraft returned without incident. This raid was followed by a series of attacks on Japanese targets in the Philippines, in Formosa, and on Hainan Island in the Tonkin Gulf. The only opposition encountered during these missions was some rather inaccurate flak. The tests were thus deemed a success, and plans were made to convert the entire 386th Bombardment Squadron to B-32s. The 312th was scheduled to move to Okinawa as soon as the conversion of the 386th BS to the B-32 was completed. Redesignated as the 312th Bombardment Group, Heavy in July 1945, the unit moved to Okinawa in August 1945 and received six more aircraft. After the Atomic Bomb missions had been flown, Combat operations were flown with the B-32 in spite of the de facto cease-fire that had been called following the bombing of Nagasaki. During this time, the B-32s flew mainly photographic reconnaissance missions, most of which were unopposed. However, on 17 August a group of 4 B-32s flying over Tokyo were fired on by radar-directed flak and were attacked by Japanese fighters. The American aircraft escaped with only minor damage, claiming one confirmed fighter kill and two probables. During a reconnaissance mission over Tokyo on 18 August, two B-32s were attacked by Japanese fighters. The American gunners claimed two kills and one probable, but one aircraft was badly shot up and one of her crew was killed with two being injured. This was to prove to be the last combat action of World War II. The last Dominator mission of the war was flown by four B-32s on 28 August in a reconnaissance mission to Tokyo. The mission was a disaster, although not because of any enemy action. 42-108544 lost an engine on takeoff and skidded off the runway. All 13 men aboard perished when the aircraft exploded and burned. On the way back from the target, 42-108528 lost power on two of its four engines. The plane's pilot ordered the crew to bail out, but two men were killed. After VJ-Day, the surviving B-32 aircraft were ordered to return to the United States, ending the test program. The 312th remained on Okinawa until December until returning to the United States. It was inactivated on 6 January 1946. =Cold War= 474th TFW Wing Commander's aircraft, North American F-100D-75-NA Super Sabre, AF Serial No. 56-3176 The 312th trained in the reserve from, 1947, being redesignated as the 312th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy), and equipped with B-29 Superfortresses. It was inactivated in 1949. It was reactivated in 1954 and trained to maintain proficiency in fighter-bomber operations with conventional weapons to September 1955, then switched to training to maintain combat proficiency with atomic weapons. From April 1956 ‚Äì October 1957, the wing rotated tactical squadrons to France, six months at a time.

It is housed in the Gem√§ldegalerie, Berlin, Germany. The work is signed BRONZO FIORENTINO on the edge of the table top. Ugolino Martelli (1519-1592) was a Florentine aristocrat, a humanist and a linguist, whose palace can be seen in the background of the picture. A marble David of the family's collection appears in the background. It was attributed at the time to Donatello, while it is now ascribed to Antonio or Bernardo Rossellino and dated between about 1461 to 1479. The earliest reference to the sculpture is in the private records of Luigi d'Ugolino Martelli (Ugolino's grandfather), in an inventory of his possessions begun in 1488. It is now in the National Gallery in Washington D.C. The David was a traditional symbol of the Florentine freedom, and could be an allusion to Martelli adherence to the city's Republican party. On the scholar's worktable a copy of Homer's Iliad, in Greek, can be seen turned towards the reader. It is open at the beginning of the ninth book, the Embassy to Achilles. A second book, of which only a corner is visible, is inscribed MARO, indicating the Latin poet Publius Vergilius Maro better known as Virgil.

It is a deuteromycete fungus that is primarily confined to eggplant species.Welles, Colin G. \\"Cercospora Leaf Spot of Eggplant.\\" Phytopathology Vol.12 No.2 (1922).Vijaya, T., M. Nagalaxmidevamma, and A. Sreeramulu. \\"Epidemiology of Cercospora Leaf Spot Disease of Brinjal - Process of Penetration.\\" Environment & Ecology 9.2 (1991): 396-98. Some other host species are Solanum aethiopicum and Solanum incanum. This plant pathogen only attacks leaves of eggplants and not the fruit.\\"Eggplant.\\" Eggplant. PlantVillage It is fairly common among the fungi that infect community gardens and home gardens of eggplant. Generally speaking, Cercospora melongenae attacks all local varieties of eggplants, but is most severe on the Philippine eggplant and less parasitic on a Siamese variety. Signs and symptoms thumbCercospora Leaf Spot on Eggplant in Hawai'i Cercospora melongenae is found primarily in warm climates close to the equator. In the US it is prevalent in Hawaii, and could potentially be found in the southern Continental US. Symptoms begin to show on the underside of older, lower leaves first due to the proximity to the soil. They are the first leaves to receive the inoculum. Lesions can be found on leaves, stems and petioles. The lesions appear small and circular at first and later progress to angular and more irregular shapes. The lesions are usually 4-10mm in diameter, and have light to dark tan concentric spots. Spots appear on the upper leaf surface first and eventually progress to the lower side of the leaf. Upon observation in the field with a handheld scope, signs of condiophores can be seen in the stomata of infected tissue. Conidiophores are typically mid-brown, and straight or slightly flexuous and septate. They are typically 30-150 microns long and 4-7 microns wide. Conidia can also sometimes be seen. Conidia of Cercospora melongenae typically have a truncate base with a somewhat thickened convex scar and a sub-acute apex. The conidia are typically 40-150 microns long and 3-4.5 microns wide, and of 4-14 septate. Later in the disease cycle excessive sporulation can be readily observed in the center of the lesions. Eventually the lesions will dry up and in some cases fall out. The fungi does not affect the fruit, however yield can be impacted due to loss of photosynthetic material.Lesions caused by Cercospora fungi on Eggplant Disease cycle Cercospora melongenae exists wholly in its asexual stage; even when grown in culture in the lab, no sexual stage is seen. This means that this disease has an imperfect life cycle, making it of the deuteromycota. Cercospora melongenae overwinters in conidiophores which asexually produce conidia. It survives the winter on lesions of previously infected fruit, plant debris, or simply in the soil. This fungus can survive up to a year in the soil. Conidia is released in the spring when the fungus is ready to infect its host, the eggplant. The conidia disperse by air or wind, or by rain-splash, and are able to infect a suitable host this way.Nijhoff, Martinus. \\"Cercospora Melongenae.\\" Mycopathologia 100 (1987): 179-80. Conidia infect an eggplant host by landing on the lower surface young leaves and entering the leaf through stomata or other natural openings of the plant or wounds on the plant. From infection, there appear to be visible lesions on the leaves. The germ tube of the fungus can enter both closed and open stomata. Multiple germ tubes from various conidia can enter the same stomata. This fungus has the best infection rates among young leaves and has a reduced infection rate of mature leaves. It is thought that the reduced infection rate of mature leaves is due to the saprophytic microflora on the leaves and the anti-fungal compounds produced by the mature leaf. This fungus produces secondary conidia within the same season; this furthers the disease cycle and allows the fungus to infect more plants. Mycelium rapidly develops. Under near perfect conditions, mycelium can develop within twelve hours of infection. The mycelium protects the next generation of conidia and ensures survival through the winter via conidiophores, and the cycle starts again the next season. Pathogenesis Cercospora melongenae overwinters in soil or plant debris as conidiophores which then can be dispersed to the plant by rain splash, irrigation water, wind or mechanical transport. The innoculum, conidia, enter through the stomata of the leaves where they germinate and produce more conidia on conidiophores. The conidia must have water or moisture in the form of heavy dew in order to germinate and therefore penetrate the leaf via. the stomata or other natural openings or wounds on the plant. Fungi in the genus Cercospora produce the plant toxin cercosporin, which causes the leaf spot appearance. Cercosporin is a photosensitizing perylenequione plant toxin that absorbs light energy and converts it into a highly activated state. This activated state then reacts with molecular oxygen to form activated oxygen, which in turn reacts with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids causing damage or cell death. The fungal spores are not harmed by the production of this toxin because they produce pyridoxine which neutralizes the reaction. While the toxin damages the host cells, conidia is produced and is able to infect the current host or spread to other susceptible hosts in the area. Environment Cercospora melongenae enters through breaks in the plant surface on the young leaf host of eggplants, typically through lesions caused by the fungi. Fruiting bodies of the fungus are overall larger when the fungus is able to proliferate during a heavy rain period versus a dry season.Welles, Colin G. \\"Taxonomic Studies on the Genus Cercospora in the Philippine Islands.\\" American Journal of Botany 12.4 (1925): 195-218. The fungus favors wet or moist leaves and high relative humidity for optimal infection.Morita, Kenji, Kei Arai, Yoji Doi, and Kiyoshi Yora. \\"Necrotic Leaf Spot, A New Virus Disease of Eggplant Caused by Broad Bean Wilt Virus.\\" Jpn. J. Phytopathol. Japanese Journal of Phytopathology 40.4 (1974): 288-94. College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources. University of Hawai'i at Manoa, Apr. 2012. A conducive environment for this fungus is one that is moist and wet, with a fair amount of wind and rainsplash for optimal dispersal. This fungi produces larger fruiting structures during a rainy season than during a dry season, indicating the need for a moist or wet environment. Essentially, the amount of moisture in the air is correlated with the sizes of the fruiting structures. In almost all cases and especially in severe cases, signs and symptoms of Cercospora melongenae have already appeared by the beginning of the dry season (or the end of the wet or rainy season). Because Cercospora melongenae is a polycyclic disease and heavily dependent on a moist or wet environment, an extremely heavy rainy season is conducive for larger and greater conidia production and dispersal. What is interesting to note is that in less susceptible eggplant varieties, such as the Siamese variety, signs and symptoms of Cercospora melongenae can be unseen and not appear until at least four weeks after the start of the dry season. Control and management Prevention Proper growing methods, crop rotation, and sanitary procedures are the most effective method of prevention of Cercospora melongenae infection.Palo, Macario A. \\"Eggplant Diseases and their Control.\\" The Philippine Journal of Agriculture 9 No. 4 (1930): 403-414. Leaf spot is a common disease found in home gardens, and preventing its spread can be done by preventing excessive moisture and humidity accumulation. Ways to reduce relative humidity and dampness include: weed control, irrigating in the morning, avoiding overhead sprinkler irrigation, increasing aeration at base of plants, using covers to minimize dampness. Crop rotation is also important, as well as the inclusion of diverse intercropping with many other vegetables. Being crop-specific, diversity will help slow down the spread of Cercospora melongenae. Sanitation, such as the use of disease free plants, and the removal of infected plant debris is critical in preventing future infestation. This disease may live in plant debris or soil for at least one year, so burning, or throwing away any infected matter is very important.Srivastava, Shikha, Scot Nelson. \\"Cercospora Leaf Spot of Eggplant\\" University of Hawai'i at M√£noa. College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources. Plant Disease 82 (1982): 1-5. http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/pd-82.pdf Chemical control There are many fungicides which control Cercospora melongenae including Oils with no added pesticides, and some with. The most common recommended is a Bordeaux mixture, which only needs to be applied once every two weeks. Neem oil, Octanoic acid and copper salt solutions, and various concentrations of Chlorothalonil are all recommended fungicides, as well. Carefully read labels, and laws regarding application regiments and practices. Fungicides for C. melongenae which are registered in Hawai'i and many other U.S states are: \\\\- Bravo Ultrex¬Æ Agricultural Fungicide \\\\- Bravo Weather Stik¬Æ Agricultural Fungicide \\\\- Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide Concentrate \\\\- Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide Ready to Use \\\\- Bonide Neem Oil Fungicide ¬∑ Miticide ¬∑ Insecticide Concentrate \\\\- Garden Safe¬Æ Brand Neem Oil Extract Concentrate \\\\- Natural Guard¬Æ Neem \\\\- Natural Guard¬Æ Copper Soap Liquid Fungicide \\\\- Serenade¬Æ Garden Disease Control Concentrate \\\\- Serenade¬Æ Garden Disease Control Ready to Spray Environmental importance Eggplant is a commonly grown vegetable in home gardens across the United States with an estimated economic value of $1.2 million USD in 1999, and 5,009 acres harvested in 2012.United States Department of Agriculture.

Because of common garden growing mistakes, Cercospora leaf spot on eggplant is one of the most common fungal infections of eggplant. It is seen to have severe significance on eggplant produce in the Philippines and other southeast Asian tropical islands. The genus Cercospora may reduce the photosynthetic area of mature leaves by over 75%, and close to 30% in young leaves. While listed as a minor Eggplant Disease in the Philippine Journal of Agriculture, it is an easily avoidable one with proper care and management.

During this time, the Commanding Officer, Captain George H Cherry RN, issued some 600 punishment warrants, gaining a reputation as a stern disciplinarian. As a consequence, the ship's officers ordered medals to be struck by Gamages of London as reward and mementos of their service under such a captain: on the obverse it read \\"Argonaut China 1900-1904\\" and showed a foul anchor (for the Royal Navy), a fleece (for Argonaut) and a dragon (for China); on the reverse are a cherry tree and a representation of the officers who survived the commission. An honorary \\"Cherry Medal\\" was presented to King George VI; many others were lost with ships sunk in the First World War. From June to September 1906, Argonaut was refitted for special service and in October, joined the Home Fleet. She was paid off in February 1911 and recommissioned February 1912, joining the 3rd Fleet. The cruiser was paid off again in April 1914.Gardiner and Gray, p.11 During the First World War Argonaut was part of the 9th Cruiser Squadron, operating in the Atlantic. The squadron was stationed off Cape Finisterre from August 1914 to July 1915. While a part of this unit, Argonaut captured the German merchant ship Graecia.

RETS was launched in 1999 by the National Association of Realtors and related groups. RETS was originally created to overcome the difficulties presented by the existence of a large number of organizations desiring to share and distribute real estate information with others. Prior to RETS, much of the data exchange was done using the FTP protocol, which did not allow for queries, and required transfer of complete datasets. The inefficiencies of this approach meant that to generate a query such as \\"new listings since yesterday\\", the entire dataset had to be downloaded again and compared with a local copy. Rather than basing a solution on alternatives used by other industries to allow for such queries, RETS was created from the ground up as a new framework to attempt to address the need for a common and efficient standard for the exchange of real estate data. Most North American multiple listing service (MLS) data exchange service providers use the RETS protocol. Although the implementation of the protocol has offered some standardization, the field names of the underlying datasets still vary widely between markets. RETS is a framework that can be adopted by computer systems to receive data from the multiple listing service (MLS) servers, as well as those of other real estate systems provided they also have software installed designed to communicate using the RETS framework. The National Association of Realtors refers to RETS as a \\"common language\\". Multiple other systems exist which support the secure and standardized transfer of datasets and associated access control requirements in a secure and efficient manner, such as MySQL. These other systems enjoy widespread adoption across most industries, whereas RETS is for one specific industry. RETS is generally not used outside North America. In 2018, the Real Estate Standards Organization announced that it planned to retire RETS and replace it with the RESO Web API.

The route runs from PA 291 in Tinicum Township, a short distance west of the Philadelphia International Airport, northwest to PA 320 in Springfield Township. PA 420 runs through suburban areas, passing through Prospect Park, Folsom, and Morton. The route interchanges with Interstate 95 (I-95) in Tinicum Township and intersects U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Prospect Park. PA 420 was first designated by 1928 to run from PA 191 at the intersection of 84th Street and Bartram Avenue in Philadelphia to PA 320 in Springfield. By 1950, the southern terminus was moved to its current location at PA 291. Route description PA 420 northbound past its southern terminus at PA 291 in Essington PA 420 begins at an intersection with PA 291 in Tinicum Township, Delaware County, heading north on four-lane divided Wanamaker Avenue. South of here, Wanamaker Avenue continues south as an unnumbered road into the community of Essington toward the Delaware River. From PA 291, the route passes near businesses and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with I-95, where it curves to the north-northwest. Past this interchange, the road heads through wooded areas within the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum before crossing the Darby Creek into the borough of Prospect Park. Here, PA 420 curves north and becomes four-lane undivided Lincoln Avenue, heading into residential areas. The route turns north-northwest again and intersects US 13 near businesses. The road narrows to two lanes and passes more homes and businesses, running through the downtown of Prospect Park. PA 420 comes to a low-clearance bridge under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor near the Prospect Park station serving SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line before it runs past more homes. The route crosses under CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision, at which point it enters Ridley Township and becomes Kedron Avenue. PA 420 northbound approaching its terminus at PA 320 in Springfield Township The road runs into business areas and crosses MacDade Boulevard in the community of Folsom. PA 420 continues through suburban development, curving to the northwest and passing near more residential neighborhoods. The route enters the borough of Morton, where it passes businesses. PA 420 becomes Woodland Avenue as it intersects Morton Avenue immediately before a grade crossing with SEPTA's Media/Elwyn Line near the Morton station. Past this, the road heads through commercial development with some homes to the northeast, continuing into Springfield Township. The route heads between woods to the west and residential areas to the east, gaining a second southbound lane as it heads into business areas and crosses Baltimore Pike. Past this, PA 420 becomes two lanes again and continues through suburban areas of homes. The road gains a center left-turn lane and passes businesses as it comes to a grade crossing with SEPTA's Route 101 trolley line at the Woodland Avenue station. The route becomes two lanes again and passes near more homes with some patches of woods. PA 420 curves more to the west and comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 320 a short distance to the south of that route's interchange with US 1. History When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 420 was not given a number. PA 420 was first designated by 1928 to run from PA 191 (84th Street/Bartram Avenue) in Philadelphia north to PA 320 in Springfield, heading west along Bartram Avenue in Philadelphia and 2nd Street in Tinicum Township to Essington, where it turned north along Wanamaker Avenue and continued along its current alignment.

It travels over a high plateau adjacent to the Lye Brook Wilderness in the Green Mountain National Forest (GMNF). The road originally served numerous logging camps and early settlements during the nineteenth century. From Stratton, the road continues eastward to West Wardsboro as a paved, year-round road. The western portion is dirt and not plowed or maintained during winter months. History Kelley Stand circa 1913 The road is named for the Kelley Stand, an \\"old-time tavern\\", which was still in operation along the route circa 1913. Kelley Stand Road is notable as the site of Daniel Webster's famous Kelley Stand speech of July 1840; a historic marker commemorates the spot. The road is near the location near where Benton MacKaye first conceived his idea of a hiking trail that ran along the Appalachian Mountain range of the eastern United States. Appalachian Trail and Long Trail The Appalachian Trail (AT), and likewise the Long Trail (LT), which share the same path in the southern Green Mountains of Vermont, cross Kelley Stand Road before the trail crosses over the summit of Stratton Mountain, which lies to the north of the road. Overnight AT/LT trailhead parking is available on the road, which also serves as an access point for other nearby trails. Northbound from Kelley Stand Road the next AT/LT shelter is the Stratton Pond shelter at AT mile point 1625, and to the south lies the Story Spring AT/LT shelter at mile point 1615. Damage from Tropical Storm Irene On August 28, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene caused major damage to the road. Until scheduled repairs were made by the US Forest Service, it remained inaccessible from the Arlington side. Destinations could still be reached from the Stratton side. In September 2014, Kelley Stand Road was completely reopened from the Arlington side, after three years of reconstruction costing $3.8 million.

View of Arana Creek and its floodplain from the Arana Loop hiking trail Arana Gulch is a creek and landform that forms part of the southeastern boundary of the city of Santa Cruz, California. The creek begins in the Santa Cruz Mountains and flows southwest into Monterey Bay into what was once called Woods Lagoon, now the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor. Hiking trail on Arana Gulch area Arana Gulch is named after Jos√© Arana, who came to Alta California in 1834 with the Hijar- Padres colonization group.C.

Sometime after that date, Arana moved to the area that now bears his name. Prior to California statehood, Arana Creek was the dividing line between lands assigned to the Villa de Branciforte (to the west) and those of Rancho Arroyo del Rodeo. The Arana Gulch open space parcel is mostly the former Hagemann farm, also called Live Oak Ranch. Frederick Hagemann was an early immigrant to this area from Germany. The Hagemann house (older section dates from 1860s, later addition from 1885) still stands on a remainder parcel adjacent to the open space.Chase, John, Judith Steen, and Daniel Platt Gregory. 2005. The sidewalk companion to Santa Cruz architecture, p.200. Santa Cruz, Calif: Museum of Art & History. Cattle once roamed the pasture and were housed in a large barn, which no longer remains. Arana Gulch open space The City of Santa Cruz has created a public park from this large parcel that lies mostly on the west side of Arana Gulch, adjacent to and upstream from the Santa Cruz harbor, and maintains Arana Gulch Open Space as a public open space.Santa Cruz, California, Parks and Recreation Department: Arana Gulch The Arana Gulch open space is part of the \\"greenbelt\\" established in 1979 to mostly surround the city. The Arana Creek watershed is a groundwater resource for Santa Cruz County. The open space includes meadows (former farmland), California oak woodland, and the riparian zones along Arana Gulch and Hagemann Gulch. Trails for hikers and bicyclists access the park from the upper harbor parking lot off of Brommer Street and from Mentel Ave. and Agnes St. in Santa Cruz on the north side. In January 2015, new, three- branched paved fully accessible pedestrian and bicycle trails were opened connecting Broadway in Santa Cruz east to Brommer Street in unincorporated Live Oak via a new bridges over Hagemann Gulch and Arana Creek, as well as a pathway connecting northward to Mentel Ave. in Santa Cruz.

Historic closures Several of the now public paths were formally private property in decades past, marked with no trespassing signage. Since becoming a public park, the space invites visitors of many species to traverse pathways and hideaways near the cattle grazing areas and adjacent wetlands. In recent times, three notable closures of the human walking trails have occurred, all arising as a response to enhance and maintain safety for the residents and community living nearby. The first recent instance occurred in 2014 with the construction of the Arana Gulch Multi-Trail Project. The new porous trail material allows water to reach the soil below, enabling subterranean fauna to 'cross the road, and get to the other side' like any other above ground resident. This trail's construction took extra time and care to minimize the ecological impact of the native habitat, and partially closed the gulch for a number of months. The next closure occurred in November 2018 Santa Cruz Park Closures, in response to the northern California fires. The measure was considered to be preventative, as locals had reported to the city police that transients were camping and cooking in the adjacent forest and posed a danger to the residents of the gulch and neighboring households. The most recent closure in April 2020 supported the state and local policy on social distancing and shelter in place measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in California.

Jencks material is evidence that is used in the course of a federal criminal prosecution in the United States. It usually consists of documents relied upon by government witnesses who testify at trial. The material is described as inculpatory, favoring the United States government's prosecution of a criminal defendant. The Jencks Act also covers other documents related to the testimony, or relied upon by government witnesses at trial. Typically, the material may consist of police notes, memoranda, reports, summaries, letters, related to an indictment or verbatim transcripts used by government agents or employees to testify at trial. This also includes a witness's grand jury testimony, if the witness testified at trial.Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 6 After the government's witness testifies, the court must, upon motion of the defendant, order the government to produce any statement of the witness in the government's possession relating to the subject matter as to which the witness testified. The court's denial of such a motion by a defendant is reversible error, although the court need not order the disclosure sua sponte.Government of the Virgin Islands v. Jamil Isaac, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11038. The usual remedy for failure of the government to produce the documents is a mistrial and dismissal of criminal charges against the defendant.Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957). Overview Salt of the Earth, a movie about his struggles. The Jencks Act was enacted by the United States Congress in response to the 1957 Supreme Court decision in Jencks v. United States,353 U.S. 657, 1 L. Ed. 2nd 1103, 77 S. Ct. 1007, 75 Ohio L Abs. 465, 40 BNA LRRM 2147, 32 CCH LC P 70731 in which the Court established various rules for the availability and production of statements of prosecution witnesses in federal criminal trials. Clinton Jencks, born in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1918, was a labor organizer in New Mexico. In 1954, he was convicted of lying about being a member of the Communist Party of the United States. During his trial, the government refused to produce documents relied upon by prosecution witnesses who were FBI informants, a move that prompted the passage of the act. Clinton Jencks starred in the 1954 movie Salt of the Earth which was a dramatized version of his struggles organizing labor. The Jencks Act By the Act, Congress exercised its power to define the rules that should govern this particular area in the trial of criminal cases instead of leaving the matter of lawmaking to the courts.Palermo v.

Ga. 19__) The Jencks Act governs production of statements and reports of prosecution witnesses during federal criminal trials. The Act provides that in any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a government witness or prospective government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of subpoena, discovery or inspection until the witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.18 U.S.C. section 3500(a). After testimony of the witness, called by the government on direct examination, the court must, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement of the witness in the possession of the government. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use. =Definition= Under the Jencks Act, a \\"statement\\" of a prosecution witness is: # A written statement made by the witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him; # A stenographic, mechanical, electrical or other recording, or a transcription of it, which is substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by the witness to an agent of the Government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement; or # A statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription of it in any made by the witness to a grand jury.18 U.S.C.S. section 3500(e). If the United States elects not to comply with an order of the court to deliver to the defendant a statement or portion of it as the court may direct, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.18 U.S.C.S. section 3500(d).

Although rough notes of an interview with a witness are producible, under Jencks Act where such notes are a substantially verbatim recital of the witness' oral statements, failure to do so is probably harmless where the notes are substantially the same as a report based on the notes and released to the defense.United States v. Morrison CA 7 Wis 946 F 2nd 484 reh en banc, den CA 7 1991 US App. Federal Rule 26.2 The provisions of the Jencks Act have been substantially incorporated into Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This is due to the notion that provisions which are purely procedural in nature should appear in the Rules, rather than in Title 18 of the United States Code. Rule 26.2 extends the provisions of the Jencks Act by providing that statements subject to production at trial are not only those of prosecution witnesses, but those of any witness other than the defendant. The Rule does not alter the Jencks Act schedule for production of statements, nor does it relieve a defendant seeking production of Jencks material from the necessity of making a request for production at the trial stage of the proceeding.US v. Litman WD Pa 547 F Supp 645US v. Phillips CA 7 Wis 854, F 2nd 273 Other cases involving the Jencks Act =Rosenberg v. United States, 1959= In Rosenberg v. United States, 1959,360 US 367, 79 SC 1231 the United States Supreme Court ruled that a letter written by a government witness to the FBI stating that her memory as to the commission of the alleged offense charged against the defendant had dimmed in the 3 years that had passed since the time of the offense, and that to refresh her failing memory she would have to reread the original statement she had given to the FBI, was producible under the Jencks Act.5 ALR 3rd 781 =United States v.

Noting that prior statements of a witness that \\"relate generally to the events and activities testified to\\" by him must be produced in the Jencks Act, the court said that since the statement in question related to the subject matter as to which the witness had testified, the statute left no room for the trial court, nor for the present court, to speculate as to how useful this statement would be for purposes of cross-examination or how important such cross-examination would be to the defendant's case. =United States v.

Ct. 647 an accomplice had testified for the prosecution at the trial of the defendant, it was held that the refusal to permit the production of a letter written by the accomplice to the government, in which he offered his assistance to the government in return for special consideration for himself, was error where such refusal was based on the ground that the letter did not \\"relate\\" to the subject matter to which the accomplice had testified. The court said there was no reason why a statement that would support impeachment for bias and interest does not \\"relate\\" to the witness' testimony as much as a statement permitting impeachment for faulty memory as was involved in Rosenberg v. United States (see case supra), and that the word \\"relate\\" as used in the statute is not limited to factual narrative.

Yellow soybean paste is a fermented paste made from yellow soybeans, salt, and water. Yellow soybean paste is produced in China and is used primarily in Beijing cuisine and other cuisines of northern China. Etymology In Chinese, the full name of the condiment is hu√°ngd√≤u ji√†ng (), but it is commonly referred to as just hu√°ng ji√†ng (\\"yellow paste\\"). Description Although it is made from yellow soybeans, the paste itself is not so much yellow as light to dark brown or even black in color. Wheat flour, though not formerly used, is often used as an additional ingredient in the modern day, and potassium sorbate may be used as a preservative. Usage Yellow soybean paste is used most notably in the noodle dish called zhajiang mian (\\"fried sauce noodles\\"), in which the yellow soybean paste is fried together with ground pork, then poured over the top of thick wheat flour noodles. Outside of Beijing, sweet bean sauce or hoisin sauce is often mixed with or used in place of the condiment, thus giving the dish a sweeter taste. Availability Yellow soybean paste is widely available in China, as well as in Chinese grocery stores overseas, and comes in plastic packages, bottled or in tins. Other varieties In recent years, a new form of yellow soybean paste, called \\"dry yellow soybean paste\\" (Âπ≤ÈªÑÈÖ±, pinyin: gƒÅn hu√°ngji√†ng; or Âπ≤ÈÖ±, pinyin: gƒÅn ji√†ng), has been developed, and is widely available in plastic packages. Its texture is drier than that of regular yellow soybean paste (due to its lower water content), allowing for easier transportation and keeping. Dry yellow soybean paste is used in a similar manner as regular yellow soybean paste, but, when using the dry form, water is first added to dilute it, and then it is added to the dish; if it is added directly to a dish, the amount of water added to the dish should be adjusted accordingly. In Thai cuisine, a variant of yellow soybean paste, often mixed with chilies, is also popular.  Technical Process  There are different kinds of soybean sauce i.e.the liquid state with high salty, solid with low salty and ferment of combination of liquid and solid according to its making process and high temperature fermentation, middle temperature fermentation and low temperature fermentation according to the temperature of the ferment.

History  In 1909, a Governor's commission on transportation recommended the construction of a bridge over the Connecticut River connecting East Haddam and Haddam.Roth, M. (1981). Connecticut: An Inventory of Historic Engineering and Industrial Sites. Society for Industrial Archeology.Retrieved from http://cttrust.org/_IMAGES/Roth%201980%20Survey(1).pdf Accepting this recommendation, to the triumph of the local communities, the state diverted aid used to fund ferry services to building the East Haddam Bridge, becoming one of the first bridges funded by the state. Since ferry service had been the main mode of transportation beginning in 1694, the East Haddam bridge marked a shift toward more modern means for travel across the Connecticut River. Construction of the bridge began in April 1912 and was completed in June 1913. On June 14, 1913, Flag Day, the East Haddam Swing Bridge officially opened. It was hailed as an ornament to the \\"age of progressiveness\\". The celebration included an address by Governor Simeon E. Baldwin, a 17-gun salute, a Model-T automobile parade, and a concert that drew thousands to the event. At the time, the State Highway Department had no authority over bridges. This meant the state legislature formed special commissions took the lead on building the East Haddam Bridge. Legislation in 1915 gave the responsibility for all trunk- line bridges in Connecticut, including the East Haddam Bridge, over to the State Highway Department. A centennial celebration for the bridge was marked on June 15, 2013 with a local parade of antique cars. The East Haddam swing bridge has been judged as being \\"Individually Eligible for the National Register of Historic Places\\".  Construction  The state hired Edward W. Bush, a prominent civil engineer in Connecticut at the time, to be the chief engineer of the project. He also designed the piers and approach roadways. Additional Boller, Hodge & Baird engineers were hired. A contract for the superstructure of the bridge was given to Holbrook, Cabot, and Rollins of Boston. A contract for the substructure of the bridge was given to American Bridge Company. The pin-connected drawbridge was designed by Alfred P. Boller, an authority on deep bridge foundations, to allow the bridge to pivot/swing, clearing a path for through river travel. The 3 spans of the bridge are all composed of rivet-connecting steel members. From west to east, the three spans include: A Warren deck truss (101 ft long), a Pennsylvania through truss (327 ft long and one of the longest in the state), and a swing span (461 ft long).

Buckley made his first appearance for the team during the 1934 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1941 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal, one Munster medal and two National League medals. An All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion, Buckley captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1941. At club level Buckley was an eight-time county club championship medalist with Glen Rovers. His brother Din Joe won five All-Ireland medals and a third brother, Jack, was an All-Ireland medalist as a non-playing substitute in 1942. Playing career =Colleges= It was during Buckley's secondary education at the North Monastery where his talents at Gaelic games were first brought to the fore. In 1934 Buckley was a key member of the college team that captured the Harty Cup title. When the North Mon retained the cup again in 1935, Buckley was captain of the team. That same year he captured a Munster medal with the college's senior football team. Together with his schoolmate Jack Lynch, Buckley was also chosen on the Munster colleges' inter-provincial hurling and football teams that year. =Club= Buckley played his club hurling with the famous Glen Rovers and enjoyed much success during a golden age for the club. As a dual player in the minor grades he won a minor football championship medal with the Glen's sister team, St. Nick's, in 1932. The following year Buckley captured a minor hurling championship medal with Glen Rovers, thus beginning a great era of success. By 1934 Buckley had joined the Glen Rovers senior hurling team and he played at midfield as the Glen lined out in only their second ever championship decider. A 3‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of four-in-a-row hopefuls St. Finbarr's gave Buckley a Cork Senior Hurling Championship medal. He added a second championship medal to his collection the following year when Carrigtwohill gave Glen Rovers a walkover in the championship decider. The Glen continued to dominated Cork hurling once again in 1936. In spite of having two players sent off, Buckley won a third successive championship medal following a decisive 7‚Äì5 to 4‚Äì2 defeat of Sarsfield's. Having been granted a walkover by the same opposition two years earlier, Glen Rovers faced Carrigtwohill in the county decider of 1937. The dominance continued and a 3‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì0 score line gave Buckley a fourth championship medal. In 1938 Glen Rovers set out to make history by besting Blackrock's twenty-five-year-old championship record. Midleton stood in the way of a fifth successive championship title, however, a comprehensive 5‚Äì6 o 1‚Äì3 score line secured the victory and gave Buckley his fifth championship. He also collected his first championship medal in football that year as St. Nick's defeated Clonakilty. The success continued once again the following year as Glen Rovers faced Blackrock in their first championship decider meeting in almost a decade. A 5‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì5 win for the Glen gave Buckley a sixth successive championship medal. Sarsfield's stood in the way of Glen Rovers securing a seventh successive championship in 1940. In one of the most high-scoring county finals of all-time, Buckley won his seventh championship medal following a 10‚Äì6 to 7‚Äì5 defeat of Sars. In 1941 Glen Rovers reached an eighth successive decider. In a game that set them apart from all other teams, the Glen continued their stranglehold of club hurling in Cork by claiming the victory following a 4‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì2 defeat of Ballincollig. Buckley had the distinction of being the only player to have lined out in all eight victories. He also added a second football championship medal to his collection as Millstreet were accounted for in the county final. Nine-in-a-row proved beyond Glen Rovers and a defeat by Ballincollig in the championship semi-final brought the curtain down of Buckley's senior club career. =Inter-county= Buckley joined the Cork senior hurling team in 1934 and was an unused substitute for that year's championship. He made his debut in the 1934‚Äì35 National League and immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen. In 1939 Cork made a breakthrough in the provincial championship after nearly a decade in the doldrums. A narrow 4‚Äì3 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of Limerick gave Cork the title and gave Buckley his only Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny. In one of the most iconic championship deciders of all-time, played on the day that World War II broke out, the climax of which was played in a ferocious thunder storm. While a draw looked likely as the hour drew to a close Paddy Phelan sent a seventy-yard free in towards the Cork goalmouth. The sliotar was gobbled up by the defence and cleared, but only as far as Jimmy Kelly who sent it straight over the bar for a one-point lead. Immediately after the puck-out the referee blew the whistle and Cork were defeated on a score line of 2‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì3. Although defeated in the All-Ireland decider, Cork continued their breakthrough in 1940. An 8‚Äì9 to 6‚Äì4 defeat of Tipperary in the decider gave Buckley his first National Hurling League medal. He added a second winners' medal to his collection in 1941 following a defeat of Dublin. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease severely hampered the 1941 championship. As a result of this Cork were nominated to represent the province in the All- Ireland series. Buckley captained the team in the final against Dublin, however, it turned into a one-sided affair thanks to contributing goals from Johnny Quirke and Ted O'Sullivan. At the full-time whistle Cork had won by 5‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì6. It was one of the most one-sided championship deciders of all- time, however, it did give Buckley an All-Ireland medal, as well as the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup on behalf of Cork. Buckley's emigration in 1942 brought his inter-county hurling career to a premature end. He returned in 1943, however, a young Cork team were attempting to capture a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. There was no place for Buckley on this team. =Inter-provincial= Buckley also lined out with Munster in the inter- provincial hurling championship where he played alongside his championship rivals from other Munster hurling counties. He played in the Railway Cup final of 1941, however, Munster were defeated by Leinster on that occasion. Personal life Born in Roman Street on the north side of Cork city, Buckley was he fourth child in a family of eleven born to Timothy and Elizabeth Buckley. He received his national school education at the nearby St. Vincent's convent and later attended the North Monastery. In 1942 Buckley was forced to emigrate to London where he found employment with the Ford Motor Company in Dagenham. He returned to Cork shortly afterwards. Buckley was married to Kitty Byrne and together they had seven children. Buckley died in Cork on 27 January 2009. At the time of his death he was the oldest surviving All-Ireland senior hurling captain.

He played hurling with his local club Blackrock and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1954 until 1963. Biography Jimmy Brohan was born in Ballintemple, County Cork in 1935. James Brohan Snr, his father, was a native of Fethard, County Tipperary who moved to Cork to work in the Metropole Hotel. His mother, Mary Murphy, hailed from Ballintemple and also worked in the Metropole. Brohan was the middle child in a family of seven and was educated at Sullivan's Quay CBS. It was here that his hurling skills were first exploited. Brohan played on the school hurling team in the Dr. Harty Cup for five consecutive years, the first two as goalkeeper and the last three as a corner-back. In 1951 Brohan was at full- forward when Sullivan's Quay defeated the famous North Monastery in the Harty Cup, before later being defeated themselves by Thurles CBS. In 1952 and 1953 he was chosen on the Munster Colleges hurling team which played in the inter- provincial competition. He enjoyed much success and won two All-Ireland colleges' medals in both those years. After leaving Sullivan's Quay in 1953 Brohan worked at the Dunlop's tyre centre in Cork until its closure in 1983. Other Cork greats who also worked there included Johnny Clifford and Willie Murphy. Brohan later worked with the Customs Service until his retirement in 2000. Two of Brohan's brothers also had sporting success playing soccer in the League of Ireland. Playing career =Club= Brohan played his club hurling with the famous Blackrock club in Cork and enjoyed much success. In 1956 the club, with Brohan playing a key role, won the senior county championship for the first time in twenty-five years. Another county title followed five years later in 1961. Brohan also played Gaelic football with Blackrock's sister club called St. Michael's and enjoyed some success. He won a county junior football championship title with the club in 1956. =Inter- county= Brohan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the early 1950s as a member of the Cork minor hurling team. He was eligible to play for the team in both 1952 and 1953, however, Tipperary defeated Cork in the early rounds of the championship in both years. At the end of 1953 Brohan made his senior debut for Cork in the National Hurling League. He duly impressed the selectors and was subsequently called up to play in the All- Ireland semi-final against Galway. Brohan was replacing the injured Tony O'Shaughnessy and had a good game, however, O'Shaughnessy returned for the All-Ireland final and Brohan was left on the bench as Cork claimed victory over Wexford. In 1955 Brohan suffered a major setback when was suspended from all GAA activity for the year, due to his failure to turn up for a club game with St. Michael's. Clare defeated Cork in the opening round of the championship as Brohan watched on from the stand. In 1956 Brohan was back with Cork and was installed at corner-back. That year Cork reached the Munster final once again. Limerick provided the opposition on that occasion; however, Cork recorded a 5‚Äì5 o 3‚Äì5 victory thanks to three goals by Christy Ring. It was Brohan's first Munster winners' medal on the field of play. Cork later lined out in the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classic games as Christy Ring was bidding for a record ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliotar up the field to set up another attack. Wexford went on to win the game on a score line of 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì8 and Brohan was left with an All-Ireland runners-up medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 353 Brohan added to his medal collection when he won a Munster junior football medal in 1957. Once again Cork's hurlers reached the Munster final, however, they were defeated by Waterford on a score line of 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì6.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 In spite of a lack of success in 1958 Brohan was still included on a Sunday Review best hurling team of the year selection. Brohan's side contested three consecutive provincial finals in 1959, 1960 and 1961, however, he ended up on the losing side on every occasion.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 In a Gael-Linn sponsored poll in the Irish Independent in 1961, Brohan was named in the right corner-back position on a hurling team considered to be the best ever.Christy Ring: Hurling‚Äôs Greatest p. 260 He retired from inter-county hurling in the early 1960s. =Inter- provincial= Brohan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1957 and helped Munster to a 5‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì5 victory over Leinster. This was the first of five consecutive Railway Cup victories for Brohan as part of the Munster team. He won a sixth and final Railway Cup winners' medal in 1963 as Munster accounted for Leinster by just a single point. =Unique style of play= Brohan had a unique style of play, often described as tidy and economical. This was best illustrated by his defensive strategy which made him one of the most famous exponents of the batting skill in hurling and he often delighted the legions of Cork supporters in the 1950s and 1960s by batting away the ball to great distances out of defence to the frustration of opposing forwards. This was a tactic which was not very well developed or used to effect by his contemporaries and he duly deserved his reputation of being master of this particular skill which was best employed in a tight entanglement which did not allow room for the full natural hurley swing more conducive to loose marking and open play. Retirement Following his retirement as a player Brohan became involved as a selector with the county hurling team. He was involved with the teams that won the All-Ireland titles in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1986. In the latter year Brohan had the pleasure of seeing his nephew, Tom Cashman, captain Cork to victory.

Engraving by Claude Randon. Galleasses were military ships developed from large merchant galleys, and intended to combine galley speed with the sea-worthiness and artillery of a galleon. While perhaps never quite matching up to their full expectations, galleasses nevertheless remained significant elements in the early modern naval armoury for some considerable time.Mattingly, Garrett, The Defeat of the Spanish Armada. (Penguin nd) p. 420 Development Converted for military use, galleasses were higher, larger and slower than regular (\\"light\\") galleys. They had up to 32 oars, each worked by up to five men. They usually had three masts, a forecastle and an aftcastle. Much effort was made in Venice to make these galleasses as fast as possible to compete with regular galleys. The gun deck usually ran over the rowers' heads, but there are also pictures showing the opposite arrangement. Galleasses usually carried more sails than true galleys and were far deadlier; a galley caught broadside lay all but helpless, since coming broadside to a galleass, as with a ship of the line, exposed an attacker to her gunfire. Relatively few galleasses were built--one disadvantage was that, being more reliant on sails, their position at the front of the galley line at the start of a battle could not be guaranteed. Naval actions *Venetian Galleasses were used successfully at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, their firepower helping to break the force of the first Turkish attack,J H Elliott, Europe Divided (London 1968) p. 193 and eventually helping to win victory for the Holy League fleet. *Four great Naples galleasses were deemed sufficiently seaworthy to accompany the Spanish Armada in 1588 (e.g. La Girona, eventually wrecked off Ireland), where they formed part of the front-line of fighting ships.G Mattingley, The Defeat of the Spanish Armada (Penguin nd) pp. 265, 385 During the Channel actions, they were repeatedly called on as a squad in any calm, to rescue Spanish stragglers or cut-off a stray English ship.G Mattingley, The Defeat of the Spanish Armada (Penguin nd) pp. 320-3 With 50 guns apiece, 300 soldiers and sailors, and 300 rowers, they were formidable ships; but their leader was wrecked after the Calais fire ship attack, (the Battle of Gravelines), and only two of the four made it back safely to Spain.G Mattingley, The Defeat of the Spanish Armada (Penguin nd) p. 420 and p. 443 Later history and parallels In the 15th century, a type of light galleass, called the frigate, was built in southern European countries to answer the increasing challenge posed by the North African-based Barbary pirates in their fast galleys. In the Mediterranean, with its less dangerous weather and fickle winds, both galleasses and galleys continued to be in use, particularly in Venice and the Ottoman Empire, long after they became obsolete elsewhere. Later, \\"round ships\\" and galleasses were replaced by galleons and ships of the line which originated in Atlantic Europe. The first Venetian ship of the line was built in 1660. In the North Sea and the western Baltic, the term galeas refers to small commercial vessels similar to a flat-sterned herring buss. In Maritime Southeast Asia, local kingdoms also built galleasses, although the tactics used were different from those of European vessels. The galley and galleass of Southeast Asia was usually equipped with bow-mounted cannon and side-mounted swivel guns. The soldiers of the Southeast Asian navy customarily fought with boarding actions, so quick firing side-mounted swivel guns were used to counter this. Acehnese large galleys (galleasses) reached 100 m in length and 17 m in breadth, having 3 masts with square sails and topsails; they were propelled by 35 oars on each side and able to carry 700 men. The galleass was armed with 98 guns: 18 large cannon (five 55-pounders at the bow, one 25-pounder at the stern, the rest were 17 and 18-pounders), 80 falcons and many swivel guns. The ship was called the \\"Espanto do Mundo\\" (terror of the universe), which was probably a free translation of \\"Cakradonya\\" (Cakra Dunia). The Portuguese reported that it was bigger than anything ever built in the Christian world, and that the gunnery on its forecastle could compete with the firepower of galleons. There were reported to be a total of 47 of them during Iskandar Muda's reign.

His league and championship career with the Cork senior team lasted four seasons from 1969 to 1973. Born in Blackrock Cork, Norberg was raised in a strong hurling family. His grandfather, Jer Norberg, won an All-Ireland medals with Cork in 1893. Norberg first appeared for the Blackrock club at juvenile and underage levels, before eventually joining the club's senior team. In a hugely successful career he won All-Ireland medals in 1972, 1974 and 1979. Norberg also won four Munster medal and five county championship medals. Norberg made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was selected for the Cork minor team in 1966. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team in which he was an All- Ireland runner-up. He subsequently joined the under-21 team, winning back-to- back All-Ireland medals in 1968 and 1969. By this stage Norberg was close to the Cork senior team and he made his debut during the 1969 Oireachtas Cup. Over the course of the following four seasons he won one Munster medal and one National League medal. Biography Frank Norberg was born in Blackrock County Cork in 1948. The possessor of a most unusual surname, his ancestors settled in Ireland after leaving Finland. Norberg was born into a family deeply associated with Cork hurling. His grandfather, Jer Norberg, won an All- Ireland title with Cork in 1893. Playing career =Club= Norberg played his club hurling with the famous Blackrock club in Cork. He enjoyed some success at underage levels before winning his first senior county championship title in 1971. This started a great run of success for the club, as ‚Äòthe Rockies‚Äô later converted this county win into a Munster club title as well as an All-Ireland club title. In 1973 Norberg won his second county medal with Blackrock. Once again this win was converted into subsequent Munster and All- Ireland club honours. The success continued in 1975 with Norberg winning a third set of county and provincial honours with his club. 'The Rockies' narrowly missed out on a third All-Ireland title after a defeat by James Stephens of Kilkenny. A fourth county medal followed for Norberg in 1978, however, he missed the club‚Äôs Munster and All-Ireland victories. He won a fifth county medal in 1979 and later collected his fourth Munster club title. =Minor & under-21= Norberg first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor team in 1966. That year he enjoyed his first success when he secured a Munster title following a 6-7 to 2-8 defeat of Galway. Cork later faced Wexford in the All-Ireland final. After a thrilling 6-7 apiece draw, Norberg's side were narrowly defeated in the replay by 4-1 to 1-8. Two years later in 1968 Norberg was a small member of the Cork under-21 team. He secured a Munster title in that grade following a 4-10 to 1-13 defeat of Tipperary. An All-Ireland final appearance soon followed with Kilkenny providing the opposition. An entertaining followed which eventually saw Cork triumph by 1-18 to 5-9. It was an All-Ireland under-21 title for Norberg. In 1969 Norberg was still eligible for the under-21 grade. He added a second Munster title to his collection that year before later lining out in a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Wexford were the opponents and after a high- scoring game Cork emerged as the winners by 5-13 to 4-7. It was Norberg's second consecutive All-Ireland under-21 title. =Senior= Following his performances in the minor and under-21 grades Norberg joined the Cork senior hurling team in 1971. He was a non-playing substitute that year, however, Cork enjoyed little success in the championship. In 1972 Norberg, in spite of never having played, was appointed captain of the Cork. After guiding his team to the National Hurling League title, Norberg later lined out in his first Munster final. Clare were the opponents and a rout took place as Cork recorded a huge 6-18 to 2-8 victory. It was Norberg's first Munster winners‚Äô medal. The game was not without incident as Norberg picked up a groin injury in that game and for a time it looked likely that his season was over. He missed Cork's subsequent victory over London in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, he recovered in time to lead out his team against Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. With time running out Cork were cruising to victory and lead ‚Äòthe Cats‚Äô by eight points. Norberg had to be substituted during the game, however, a victory seemed certain. A Kilkenny fight-back saw the team draw level with Cork and score a further seven points without reply to capture a 3-24 to 5-11 victory. It was a huge blow to a Cork team that seemed destined for victory. Norberg was relegated to the substitutes' bench again in 1973 before leaving the inter-county set-up at the end of the year.

He was best known as \\"Singin' Sam, the Barbasol Man\\" for his long association with that company. Early life The son of clothing merchant Sol Frankel, Harry grew up in Danville, Kentucky, singing in various quartets, moving with his parents to Richmond, Indiana, when he was nine years old. He joined Coburn's Minstrels in 1908 and later toured with Al G. Field's Minstrels. Frankel and Joe Dunlevy were known as the \\"Two Blackbirds\\" when they performed in vaudeville theaters during the late 1920s. Career When Frankel began in radio in 1930 on WLW (Cincinnati, Ohio), sponsored by the Great States Lawn Mower Company, he started using Singin' Sam as his professional name, and he was also known at that time as \\"The Lawnmower Man.\\" In New York he began as \\"Singin' Sam the Barbasol Man\\" on WABC on July 20, 1931. He disliked New York, and three years later, he returned to Richmond, Indiana, with vocalist Helene \\"Smiles\\" Davis, so named because of her identification with the (then new) song \\"Smiles\\" while singing to the troops during World War I. The couple married May 2, 1934, in Richmond and lived first on their farm, known as Just-a-Mere Farm, ll miles west of town on the National Road (now U.S. Route 40). They later lived on small farm on the southeast side of Richmond with a large colonial revival house with a pool and several outbuildings. In late 1934, Singin' Sam returned to broadcasting after Barbasol arranged to do his show live from Cincinnati, an easy commute. He continued with Barbasol until 1941, and during that time, he also did shows for Coca-Cola, flying to New York on alternate weeks to make transcriptions for his weekly 15-minute Refreshment Time with Singin' Sam, which aired from 1937 to 1942. In total, he made 260 transcriptions for the syndicated program.

It involves various legal aspects as it is often used to exchange intellectual property that is subject to copyright law or licensing. File hosting and sharing File hosting services may be used as a means to distribute or share files without consent of the copyright owner. In such cases one individual uploads a file to a file hosting service, which others may download. Legal history is documented in case law. For example in the case of Swiss-German file hosting service RapidShare, in 2010 the US government's congressional international anti- piracy caucus declared the site a \\"notorious illegal site\\", claiming that the site was \\"overwhelmingly used for the global exchange of illegal movies, music and other copyrighted works\\". But in the legal case Atari Europe S.A.S.U. v. Rapidshare AG in Germany (Legal case: OLG D√ºsseldorf, Judgement of 22 March 2010, Az I-20 U 166/09 dated 22 March 2010) the D√ºsseldorf higher regional court examined claims related to alleged infringing activity and reached the conclusion on appeal that \\"most people utilize RapidShare for legal use cases\\" \\\\- cite from ruling: \\"Es ist davon auszugehen, dass die weit √ºberwiegende Zahl von Nutzern die Speicherdienste zu legalen Zwecken einsetzen und die Zahl der missbr√§uchlichen Nutzer in der absoluten Minderheit ist.\\" (It is to be expected that the vast majority of users use the storage services for lawful purposes and the number of abusive users are in the absolute minority.) and that to assume otherwise was equivalent to inviting \\"a general suspicion against shared hosting services and their users which is not justified\\".From the Atari v. RapidShare ruling: \\"entspricht einem Generalverdacht gegen Sharehoster-Dienste und ihre Nutzer, der so nicht zu rechtfertigen ist\\" (corresponds to a general suspicion against shared hosting services and their users, which is not to justify such) The court also observed that the site removes copyrighted material when asked, does not provide search facilities for illegal material, noted previous cases siding with RapidShare, and after analysis the court concluded that the plaintiff's proposals for more strictly preventing sharing of copyrighted material - submitted as examples of anti- file sharing measures RapidShare might have adopted - were found to be \\"unreasonable or pointless\\".Legal case: OLG Dusseldorf, Judgement of 22 March 2010, Az I-20 U 166/09 dated 22 March 2010. In January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. Their indictment concluded that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses, suggesting a number of design features of its operating model as being evidence showing a criminal intent and venture.Department of Justice indictment, on Wall Street Journal's website - see sections 7 - 14. Jurisdictions =Australia= A secondary liability case in Australia, under Australian law, was Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd [2005] FCA 1242 (5 September 2005). In that case, the Court determined that the Kazaa file sharing system had \\"authorized\\" copyright infringement. The claim for damages was subsequently settled out of court. In the case of AFACT v iiNet which was fought out in the Federal Court, an internet service provider was found not to be liable for the copyright infringement of its users. The case did not, however, create a clear precedent that Australian ISPs could never be held liable for the copyright infringement of their users by virtue of providing an internet connection. AFACT and other major Australian copyright holders have stated their intention to appeal the case, or pursue the matter by lobbying the government to change the Australian law. =Canada= The Copyright Modernization Act was passed in 2012, and came into effect on 2 January 2015. It provides for statutory damages for cases of non-commercial infringement between $100 and $5 000 and damages for commercial infringement from $500 to $20 000. =China= The People's Republic of China is known for having one of the most comprehensive and extensive approaches to observing web activity and censoring information in the world. Popular social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook cannot be accessed via direct connection by its citizens. Mainland China requires sites that share video files to have permits and be controlled by the state or owned by state. These permits last for three years and will need renewal after that time period. Web sites that violate any rules will be subject to a 5-year ban from providing videos online. One of the country's most used file sharing programs, BTChina got shut down in December 2009. It was shut down by the State Administration of Radio Film and Television for not obtaining a license to legally distribute media such as audio and video files. Alexa, a company that monitors web traffic, claims that BTChina had 80,000 daily users. Being one of the primary file sharing websites for Chinese citizens, this shutdown affected the lives of many internet users in China. China has an online population of 222.4 million people and 65.8% are said to participate in some form of file-sharing on websites. =European Union= On 5 June 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled that making temporary copies on the user's screen or in the user's cache is not, in itself, illegal. The ruling relates to the British Meltwater case settled on that day. The judgement of the court states: \\"Article 5 of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that the copies on the user‚Äôs computer screen and the copies in the internet 'cache' of that computer‚Äôs hard disk, made by an end-user in the course of viewing a website, satisfy the conditions that those copies must be temporary, that they must be transient or incidental in nature and that they must constitute an integral and essential part of a technological process, as well as the conditions laid down in Article 5(5) of that directive, and that they may therefore be made without the authorisation of the copyright holders.\\" The Boy Genius Report weblog noted that \\"As long as an Internet user is streaming copyrighted content online ... it‚Äôs legal for the user, who isn‚Äôt willfully [sic] making a copy of said content. If the user only views it directly through a web browser, streaming it from a website that hosts it, he or she is apparently doing nothing wrong.\\" In November 2009, the European Parliament voted on changes to the Telecoms Package. With regard to file-sharing, MEPs agreed to compromise between protecting copyright and protecting user's rights. A European Parliament statement reads \\"A user's internet access may be restricted, if necessary and proportionate, only after a fair and impartial procedure including the user's right to be heard.\\" EU members were given until May 2011 to implement these changes into their own laws.European MPs votes on new telecoms law, 24 November 2009 =Germany= In Germany, file sharing is illegal and even one copyrighted file downloaded through BitTorrent can trigger ‚Ç¨1000 fines or more. The GEMA also used to block many YouTube videos. Graduated response Demonstration in Sweden in support of file sharing, 2006 In response to copyright violations using peer to peer file sharing or BitTorrent the content industry has developed what is known as a graduated response, or three strikes system. Consumers who do not adhere to repeated complaints on copyright infringement, risk losing access to the internet. The content industry has thought to gain the co-operation of internet service providers (ISPs), asking them to provide subscriber information for IP addresses identified by the content industry as engaged in copyright violations. Consumer rights groups have argued that this approach denies consumers the right to due process and the right to privacy. The European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution in April 2008 admonishing laws that would require ISPs to disconnect their users and would prevent individuals from acquiring access to broadband. In a number of European countries attempts to implement a graduated response have led to court cases to establish under which circumstances an ISP may provide subscriber data to the content industry. In order to pursue those that download copyrighted material the individual committing the infringing must be identified. Internet users are often only identifiable by their Internet Protocol address (IP address), which distinguishes the virtual location of a particular computer. Most ISPs allocate a pool of IP addresses as needed, rather than assigning each computer a never-changing static IP address. Using ISP subscriber information the content industry has thought to remedy copyright infringement, assuming that the ISPs are legally responsible for the end user activity, and that the end user is responsible for all activity connected to his or hers IP address. In 2005 a Dutch court ordered ISPs in the Netherlands not to divulge subscriber information because of the way the Dutch content industry group had collected the IP addresses (Foundation v. UPC Nederland). According to Dutch law ISPs can only be ordered to provide personal subscriber data if it is plausible that an unlawful act occurred, and if it is shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the subscriber information will identify the person who committed the infringing act. In Germany court specifically considered the right to privacy and in March 2008 the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that ISPs could only give out IP address subscription information in case of a \\"serious criminal investigation\\". The court furthermore ruled that copyright infringement did not qualify as a serious enough offense. Subsequently, in April 2008, the Bundestag (German parliament) approved a new law requiring ISPs to divulge the identity of suspected infringers who infringe on a commercial scale. Similarly, in Sweden, a controversial file sharing bill is awaiting the Riksdag‚Äôs approval. The law, which would enter into effect on 1 April 2009, would allow copyright holders to request the IP addresses and names of copyright infringement suspects in order to take legal action against them. The copyright holders, though, should present sufficient evidence of harm to justify the release of information regarding the Internet subscribers. In Italy, the courts established that criminal liability does not extend to file sharing copyrighted material, as long as it is not done for commercial gain. Ruling on a case involving a copyright holder who employed a third party to collect IP addresses of suspected copyright infringers, the Italian Data Protection Authority ruled in February 2008 that the systematic monitoring peer-to-peer activities for the purpose of detecting copyright infringers and suing them is prohibited. = France = In October 2009, France's highest constitutional court approved the HADOPI law, a \\"three-strikes law\\";France Approves Wide Crackdown on Net Piracy. Pfanner, Eric (2009). https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/technology/23net.html?_r=2/ . however, the law was revoked on 10 July 2013 by the French Government because the punitive penalties imposed on copyright infringers was considered to be disproportionate. = Ireland = In May 2010, Irish internet provider Eircom have announced they will cut off the broadband connection of subscribers suspected of copyright infringement on peer-to-peer file sharing networks. Initially, customers will be telephoned by Eircom to see if they are aware of the unauthorized downloads. When customers are identified for a third time they will lose their internet connection for 7 days, if caught for a fourth time they will lose their internet connection for a year. = Japan = File sharing in Japan is notable for both its size and sophistication.Shirley Gene Field (2010). \\"Internet Piracy in Japan: Lessig‚Äôs Modalities of Constraint and Japanese File Sharing\\". University of Texas Masters Thesis. The Recording Industry Association of Japan claims illegal downloads outnumber legal ones 10:1.\\"Japan introduces piracy penalties for illegal downloads\\". BBC. The sophistication of Japan's filesharing is due to the sophistication of Japanese anti-filesharing. Unlike most other countries, Copyright infringement is not just a civil offense, but a criminal one, with penalties of up to ten years for uploading and penalties of up to two years for downloading. There is also a high level of Internet service provider cooperation.George Ou (16 March 2008). \\"Japan's ISPs agree to ban P2P pirates\\". ZDNet, . This makes for a situation where file sharing as practiced in many other countries is quite dangerous. To counter, Japanese file sharers employ anonymization networks with clients such as Perfect Dark („Éë„Éº„Éï„Çß„ÇØ„Éà„ÉÄ„Éº„ÇØ) and Winny. = Malaysia = In June 2011, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has ordered the blocking of several websites including The Pirate Bay and several file- hosting websites via a letter dated 30 May to all Malaysian ISPs for violating Section 41 of the Copyright Act 1987, which deals with pirated content. = Mexico = Mexican law does not currently address non-commercial file sharing, although Mexican legislators have considered increasing penalties for unauthorized file sharing. Broadband usage is increasing in Mexico, and Internet cafes are common,. Due to the relative lack of authorized music distribution services in Mexico, filesharing continues to dominate music access. According to the recording industry in 2010, Internet sharing of music dominated approximately 90% of the total music market in Mexico with peer to peer networks the most dominant form of music copyright infringement. = Netherlands = According to Dutch law reproduction of a literary, science, or art work is not considered a violation on the right of the creator or performing artist when all of the following conditions have been met: *The copy has not been made with an (in)direct commercial motive *The copy's purpose is exclusively for own practice, study or use *The number of copies is limited Such a copy is called a 'thuiskopie' or home copy. Since 2018, following a decision by the Ministry of Justice, there is an organization which guarantees that artists and rights holders get a compensation for copies of their works made for private use. This compensation is levied indirectly through a surcharge on information carriers such as blank CD's, blank DVD's, MP3 Players, and, since 2013, hard drives and tablets. = North Korea = File sharing in North Korea is done by hand with physical transport devices such as computer disk drives, due to lack of access to the Internet. It is illegal, due to regime attempts to control culture.Jeremy Hsu (22 May 2012). \\"Illegal File-Sharing Opens North Korea to World\\". Yahoo! News. Despite government repression, file sharing is common, as it is in most other countries.Ian Steadman (6/08/2012). \\"Report finds rampant filesharing in North Korea, despite the risks\\". Wired. Because official channels are heavily dominated by government propaganda and outside media is banned, illegally traded files are a unique view into the outside world for North Koreans. The most shared media is from South Korea; k-pop and soap operas. = South Korea = In March 2009, South Korea passed legislation that gave internet users a form of three strikes for unlawful file sharing with the intention of curbing online theft. This is also known as graduated response. As the number of cases of unauthorized sharing increases, the proportion of youth involved has increased. As file shares are monitored, they are sent messages instructing them to stop. If their file sharing continues, their internet connection may be disconnected for up to six months. The force behind this movement is the Korean National Assembly's Committee on Culture, Sports, Tourism, Broadcasting & Communications (CCSTB&C;). With help from local internet service providers, the CCSTB&C; have gained access and formed communication channels to specific file sharing users. =Spain= In a series of cases, Spanish courts have ruled that file sharing for private use is legal. In 2006, the record industry's attempts to criminalize file sharing were thwarted when Judge Paz Aldecoa declared it legal to download indiscriminately in Spain, if done for private use and without any intent to profit, and the head of the police's technology squad has publicly said \\"No pasa nada. Pod√©is bajar lo que quer√°is del eMule. Pero no lo vend√°is.\\" (\\"It's ok. You can download whatever you want with eMule. But don't sell it.\\"). There have been demonstrations where the authorities have been informed that copyrighted material would be downloaded in a public place, the last of which took place on 20 December 2008. No legal action was taken against the protestors. In another decision from May 2009,Downloading 3322 Copyrighted Movies is Okay in Spain , at TorrentFreak a judge ruled in favor of a person engaged in the private, non-commercial file- sharing of thousands of movies, even though the copying was done without the consent of the copyright owners. The Spanish Supreme Court has ruled that personal data associated with an IP address may only be disclosed in the course of a criminal investigation or for public safety reasons. (Productores de M√∫sica de Espa√±a v. Telef√≥nica de Espa√±a SAU). It has been reported that Spain has one of the highest rates of file-sharing in Europe.Spain finds that film piracy is a hard habit to break. Tremlett, Giles (2010). . Over a twelve- month period there were 2.4 billion reported downloads of copyrighted works including music, video games, software and films in Spain. Statistics for 2010 indicate that 30% of the Spanish population uses file-sharing websites, double the European average of 15%. Record labels would have it that this has had a negative impact on the industry, with investment drying up, according to IFPI head John Kennedy. In 2003, for instance, 10 new Spanish artists appeared in the top 50 album chart, but in 2009 not a single new Spanish artist featured in the same chart. Album sales dropped by two-thirds over a period of five years leading up to 2010. \\"Spain runs the risk of turning into a cultural desert ... I think it's a real shame that people in authority don't see the damage being done.\\"Allen, Katie. Piracy continues to cripple music industry as sales fall 10% The Guardian. 21 January 2010. However, the Spanish Association of Music Promoters (APM) states that \\"Music is alive,\\" as despite the decrease in record sales the revenues from concert ticket sales has increased 117% over the last decade, from ‚Ç¨69.9 million to ‚Ç¨151.1 million in 2008. The number of concerts doubled from 71,045 in 2000 to 144,859 in 2008, and the number of people attending concerts increased from 21.8 million in 2000 to over 33 million in 2008.El n√∫mero de conciertos en Espa√±a y la recaudaci√≥n por venta de entradas se multiplicaron por dos en la √∫ltima d√©cada. Despite the troubles weathered by the entertainment industry, file sharing and torrent websites were ruled legal in Spain in March 2010. The judge responsible for the court ruling stated that \\"P2P networks are mere conduits for the transmission of data between Internet users, and on this basis they do not infringe rights protected by Intellectual Property laws\\".File Sharing and Torrent Websites Now Legal in Spain. Wilhelm, Alex. (2010). On 20 September 2013, the Spanish government approved new laws that will take effect at the beginning of 2014. The approved legislation will mean that website owners who are earning \\"direct or indirect profit,\\" such as via advertising links, from pirated content can be imprisoned for up to six years. Peer-to-peer file- sharing platforms and search engines are exempt from the laws. Since January 2015, Vodafone Spain blocks thepiratebay.org as requested by the Ministry of Interior. And since 29 March 2015 thepiratebay is blocked on multiple URLs from all ISPs[111] = United Kingdom = Around 2010, the UK government's position was that action would help drive the UK‚Äôs vital creative and digital sectors to bolster future growth and jobs. According to a 2009 report carried out by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry 95 per cent of music downloads are unauthorised, with no payment to artists and producers. Market research firm Harris Interactive believed there to be 8.3 million file sharers in the UK. Moreover the BPI claimed that in 1999 UK music purchases totaled ¬£1,113 million but had fallen to ¬£893.8 million in 2008. The Digital Economy Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 9 April 2010. But subsequently its main provisions were never legislatively passed. ;Historical situation prior to 2010 Previous cases in the UK have seen internet users receive bills of ¬£2500 for sharing music on the internet. ; Digital Economy Act 2010 The Digital Economy Bill proposed that internet service providers (ISPs) issue warnings by sending letters to those downloading copyrighted files without authorization. Following this, the bill proposed that ISPs slow down or even suspend internet access for repeat offenders of unauthorized file sharing. The bill aimed to force internet service providers to disclose the identities of those offenders as well as making conditions for the regulation of copyright licensing. The Digital Economy Bill incorporated a graduated response policy despite the alleged file sharer not necessarily having to be convicted of copyright offences.Digital Economy Bill The bill also introduced fines of up to ¬£50,000 for criminal offences relating to copyright infringement ‚Äì for example if music is downloaded with intent to sell. The high penalty is considered to be proportionate to the harm caused to UK industries. An appeals process exists whereby the accused can contest the case however, the concern has been expressed that this process will be costly and that, in requiring the individual to prove their innocence, the bill reverses the core principles of natural justice. Similarly, a website may be blocked if it is considered that it has been, is being, or is likely to be used in connection with copyright infringement meaning that a site does not actually have to be involved in copyright infringement ‚Äì rather intent must be proved. The Act was seen as controversial, and potentially creating serious repercussions for both file sharers and internet service providers. The bill was met with a mixed response. Geoff Taylor of the BPI claims the bill is vital for the future of creative works in the UK. The Conservative party spokesman for Culture and Media stated that those downloading should be given a criminal record. Conversely, the Liberal Democrat party spokesman for Culture and Media claimed the bill was reckless and dangerous stating that children could unwittingly be file sharing causing an entire family to lose their internet connection. In addition to this, there was concern that hackers may access internet connections to download files and leave the bill payer responsible. Specific concerns raised included: :* Providers of public Wi-Fi access is uncertain. Responsibility for breaches could be passed on to the provider due to the difficulty in identifying individual users. The internet provider therefore may risk losing internet access or facing a hefty fine if an infringement of copyright takes place. Many libraries and small caf√©s for example may find this impossible to adhere to as it would require detailed logging of all those requiring internet access. In libraries in particular this may provide challenges to the profession‚Äôs importance of user privacy and could force changes in future policies such as Acceptable Use Policies (AUP). Public libraries utilise AUPs in order to protect creative works from copyright infringement and themselves from possible legal liability. However, unless the AUP is accompanied by the provision of knowledge on how to obey laws it could be seen as unethical, as blame for any breaches is passed to the user.Britz, J. J. (2002). Information Ethics: its Demarcation and Application. In: Lipinski, T. A. (eds.) Libraries, Museums, and Archives: Legal and Ethical Challenges in the New Era of Information. Maryland: The Scarecrow Press. pp. 194‚Äì219. :* Hospitality sector - may also be affected by the Digital Economy Act. The British Hospitality Association has stated that hotels would have particular problems in providing details of guest‚Äôs internet access to Internet Service Providers and entire hotels may face disconnection. They have also expressed their concern that an individual's actions may lead to such a drastic outcome.Arthur, C. (2010). Opposition to the Digital Economy Bill. The Guardian. Availability: . Last accessed 30 March 2010. :* Internet service providers were also hostile towards the bill. TalkTalk stated that suspending access to the internet breached human rights. This view may be shared by many, as a survey carried out by the BBC found that 87% of internet users felt internet access should be the \\"fundamental right of all people\\". Certainly, people require access to the internet for many aspects of their life for example shopping, online banking, education, work and even socialising. Furthermore, TalkTalk Director of Regulation, Andrew Heaney has acknowledged that file sharing is a problem but the answer is to educate people and create legal alternatives. Heaney has also argued that disconnected offenders will simply create other user names to hide their identity and continue downloading. TalkTalk has claimed that 80% of youngsters would continue to download regardless of the bill and that internet service providers are being forced to police this without any workable outcomes.\\"Music fans will sidestep filesharing clampdown says TalkTalk\\" TalkTalk Press Centre 15 March 2010 :* Cable company Virgin Media also criticized the Digital Economy Bill believing it to be heavy handed and likely to alienate customers. Virgin advocated the development of alternative services which people would choose instead of file sharing. The bill provoked protests in many forms. The Guardian reported that hundreds were expected to march outside the House of Commons on 24 March 2010. Moreover, an estimated 12,000 people sent emails to their MPs, through the citizen advocacy organization 38 degrees. 38 degrees objected to the speed with which the bill was rushed through parliament, without proper debate, due to the imminent dissolution of parliament prior to a general election. In October 2009 TalkTalk launched its Don't Disconnect Us campaign asking people to sign a petition against the proposal to cut off the internet connections of those accused of unauthorized file sharing. By November 2009 the petition had almost 17,000 signatories and by December had reached over 30,000. The Pirate Party in the UK called for non-commercial file sharing to be legalized. Formed in 2009 and intending to enter candidates in the 2010 UK general election, the Pirate Party advocates reform to copyright and patent laws and a reduction in government surveillance.Pirate Party Official website, The Code which would implement these sections of the Act was never passed into law by Parliament, and no action was taken on it after around 2013. ; Digital Economy Act 2017 The Digital Economy Act 2017 updates the anti-infringement provisions of existing laws, creates or updates criminal copyright breach provisions, and provides for a wider range of sentencing for criminal infringement. =United States= In Sony Corp. v. Universal Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984), the Supreme Court found that Sony's new product, the Betamax (the first mass-market consumer videocassette recorder), did not subject Sony to secondary copyright liability because it was capable of substantial non-infringing uses. Decades later, this case became the jumping-off point for all peer-to-peer copyright infringement litigation. The first peer-to-peer case was A&M; Records v. Napster, 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001). Here, the 9th Circuit considered whether Napster was liable as a secondary infringer. First, the court considered whether Napster was contributorily liable for copyright infringement. To be found contributorily liable, Napster must have engaged in \\"personal conduct that encourages or assists the infringement.\\"A&M; Records v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, 1019 (9th Cir. 2001) citing Matthew Bender & Co. v. West Publ'g Co., 158 F.3d 693, 706 (2d Cir. 1998) The court found that Napster was contributorily liable for the copyright infringement of its end- users because it \\"knowingly encourages and assists the infringement of plaintiffs' copyrights.\\"Napster, at 1020. The court analyzed whether Napster was vicariously liable for copyright infringement. The standard applied by the court was whether Napster \\"has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities.\\"Napster, at 1022, citing Gershwin Publ'g Corp. v. Columbia Artists Mgmt., Inc, 443 F.2d 1159, 1162 (2d Cir. 1971. The court found that Napster did receive a financial benefit, and had the right and ability to supervise the activity, meaning that the plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim of vicarious infringement.Napster, at 1024. The court denied all of Napster's defenses, including its claim of fair use. The next major peer-to-peer case was MGM v. Grokster, 545 U.S. 913 (2005). In this case, the Supreme Court found that even if Grokster was capable of substantial non-infringing uses, which the Sony court found was enough to relieve one of secondary copyright liability, Grokster was still secondarily liable because it induced its users to infringe.MGM v. Grokster, 514 U.S. 913, 940 (2005). It is important to note the concept of blame in cases such as these. In a pure P2P network there is no host, but in practice most P2P networks are hybrid. This has led groups such as the RIAA to file suit against individual users, rather than against companies. The reason that Napster was subject to violation of the law and ultimately lost in court was because Napster was not a pure P2P network but instead maintained a central server which maintained an index of the files currently available on the network. Around the world in 2006, an estimated five billion songs, equating to approximately 38,000 years in music were swapped on peer-to-peer websites, while 509 million songs were purchased online. The same study which estimated these findings also found that artists that had an online presence ended up retaining more of the profits rather than the music companies.June 2008, The Tables Have Turned: Rock Stars ‚Äì Not Record Labels ‚Äì Cashing In On Digital Revolution, IBISWorld In November 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced the Secure Federal File Sharing Act,, The Secure Federal File Sharing Act, introduced 17 November 2009 which would, if enacted, prohibit the use of peer-to-peer file- sharing software by U.S. government employees and contractors on computers used for federal government work. The bill has died with the adjournment of 111th Congress. Copyright law A copyright in the United States consists of the exclusive rights enumerated under 17 USC 106. When having to do with pictures, music, literature or video, these exclusive rights include: 1\\\\. The right to reproduce or redistribute the picture, music, lyrics, text, video, or images of a video. 2\\\\. The right to distribute the picture, music, lyrics, text, video, or images of a video. 3\\\\. The right to produce derivative works of the copyrighted work. 4\\\\. The right to perform the work publicly. 5\\\\. The right to display the work publicly. 6\\\\. The right to transmit the work through the use of radio or digital transition. In summary, these exclusive rights cover the reproduction, adaptation, publication, performance, and display of a copyrighted work (subject to limitations such as fair use). Anyone who violates the exclusive rights of copyright has committed copyright infringement, whether or not the work has been registered at the copyright office. If an infringement has occurred, the copyright owner has a legal right to sue the infringer for violating the terms of their copyright. The monetary value of the lawsuit can be whatever a jury decides is acceptable. In the case of file sharing networks, companies claim that peer-to-peer file sharing enables the violation of their copyrights. File sharing allows any file to be reproduced and redistributed indefinitely. Therefore, the reasoning is that if a copyrighted work is on a file sharing network, whoever uploaded or downloaded the file is liable for violating the copyright because they are reproducing the work without the authorization of the copyright holder or the law. Primary infringement liability The fundamental question, \\"what use can a P2P file-sharing network's customers make of the software and of copyrighted materials without violating copyright law\\", has no answer at this time, as there has been almost no dispositive decision-making on the subject. This issue has received virtually no appellate attention, the sole exception being BMG Music v. Gonzalez, a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which held that where a defendant has admitted downloading and copying song files from other users in the P2P network without permission of the copyright holders, she cannot claim that such copying is a \\"fair use\\". Since Gonzalez involves a defendant who had admitted to actual copying and downloading of songs from other unauthorized users, it is of limited applicability in contested cases, in that it relates solely to the reproduction right in 17 USC 106(1), and has no bearing on the 17 USC 106(3) distribution right. A series of cases dealing with the RIAA's \\"making available\\" theory has broad implications, not only for the subject of P2P file sharing but for the Internet at large. The first to receive a great deal of attention was Elektra v. Barker, an RIAA case against Tenise Barker, a Bronx nursing student. Ms. Barker moved to dismiss the complaint, contending, among other things, that the RIAA's allegation of \\"making available\\" did not state any known claim under the Copyright Act. The RIAA countered with the argument that even without any copying, and without any other violation of the record companies' distribution rights, the mere act of \\"making available\\" is a copyright infringement, even though the language does not appear in the Copyright Act, as a violation of the \\"distribution\\" right described in 17 USC 106(3). Thereafter, several amicus curiae were permitted to file briefs in the case, including the MPAA, which agreed with the RIAA's argument, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the U.S. Internet Industry Association (USIIA), and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), which agreed with Ms. Barker. The US Department of Justice submitted a brief refuting one of the arguments made by EFF, but did not take any position on the RIAA's \\"making available\\" argument, noting that it had never prosecuted anyone for \\"making available\\". The Elektra v. Barker case was argued before Judge Kenneth M. Karas in Manhattan federal court on 26 January 2007,\\"Elektra v. Barker \\"Making Available\\" Oral Argument Now Available Online\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 27 February 2007 and decided on 31 March 2008.\\"Judge rejects RIAA \\"making available\\" theory but sustains complaint, and gives RIAA chance to replead defective theory in Elektra v. Barker\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 31 March 2008. The decision rejected the RIAA's \\"making available\\" theory but sustained the legal sufficiency of the RIAA's pleading of actual distribution and actual downloading. Additionally, the Court suggested to the RIAA that it might want to amend its complaint to include a claim for \\"offering to distribute for purposes of distribution\\", but gave no guidance on what type of evidence would be required for an \\"offer\\". The Court's suggestion that merely \\"offering\\" to distribute could constitute a violation of the Act has come under attack from William Patry, the author of the treatise Patry on Copyright.\\"The recent making available cases\\" , The Patry Copyright Blog, 3 April 2008. Three other decisions, also rejecting the RIAA's \\"making available\\" theory, came from more unexpected sources. The Barker decision was perhaps rendered anticlimactic by the decision of Judge Janet Bond Arterton, from the District of Connecticut, handed down six weeks earlier, in Atlantic v. Brennan,\\"Default judgment denied in Atlantic v. Brennan, RIAA complaint insufficient, possible defenses of copyright misuse, excessive damages\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 25 February 2008. rejecting the RIAA's application for a default judgment. Brennan, like Barker, rejected the RIAA's \\"making available\\" theory, but unlike Barker it found the RIAA's specificity on the other issues to be insufficient, and it rejected the conceptual underpinnings upon which Judge Karas based his \\"offer to distribute\\" idea. And Barker was perhaps overshadowed by the decision of Judge Gertner, rendered the same day as the Barker decision, in quashing a subpoena served on Boston University to learn the identity of BU students, in London- Sire v. Doe 1.\\"RIAA's Boston University Subpoena Quashed in Arista v. Does 1‚Äì21\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 3 April 2008. Here too the Court rejected the RIAA's \\"making available\\" theory, but here too‚Äîlike Atlantic but unlike Elektra ‚Äì also rejected any possible underpinning for an \\"offer to distribute\\" theory. And then came the decision of the District Judge Neil V. Wake, in the District of Arizona, in Atlantic v. Howell. This 17-page decision\\"RIAA summary judgment motion denied in Atlantic v. Howell; RIAA 'making available' theory & Judge Karas 'offer to distribute' theory rejected\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 29 April 2008 ‚Äì rendered in a case in which the defendant appeared pro se (i.e., without a lawyer) but eventually received the assistance of an amicus curiae brief and oral argument by the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\"Jeffrey Howell is not alone; Electronic Frontier Foundation files amicus curiae brief refuting RIAA arguments in Atlantic v. Howell\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 12 January 2008‚Äîwas devoted almost exclusively to the RIAA's \\"making available\\" theory and to the \\"offer to distribute\\" theory suggested by Judge Karas in Barker. Atlantic v. Howell strongly rejected both theories as being contrary to the plain wording of the Copyright Act. The Court held that \\"Merely making a copy available does not constitute distribution....The statute provides copyright holders with the exclusive right to distribute \\"copies\\" of their works to the public \\"by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.\\" 17 U.S.C. ...106(3). Unless a copy of the work changes hands in one of the designated ways, a \\"distribution\\" under ...106(3) has not taken place.\\" The Court also expressly rejected the 'offer to distribute' theory suggested in Barker, holding that \\"An offer to distribute does not constitute distribution\\".For commentary on Atlantic v. Howell see \\"Atlantic Recording Corp. v. Howell\\" , The Patry Copyright Blog, 30 April 2008. For the amicus curiae brief submitted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in support of Mr. Howell, see \\"Jeffrey Howell is not alone; Electronic Frontier Foundation files amicus curiae brief refuting RIAA arguments in Atlantic v. Howell\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 12 January 2008 The next critical decision was that in Capitol v. Thomas, which had received a great deal of media attention because it was the RIAA's first case to go to trial, and probably additional attention due to its outsized initial jury verdict. The RIAA had prevailed upon the trial judge to give the jurors an instruction which adopted its \\"making available\\" theory,\\"Jury Instructions in Virgin v. Thomas Available Online\\" Recording Industry vs. The People, 5 October 2007 (See instruction number 15) over the protestations of the defendant's lawyer. Operating under that instruction, the jury returned a $222,000 verdict over $23.76 worth of song files.\\"RIAA Wins in First-Ever Jury Trial; Verdict of $222,000 for 24 Song Files Worth $23.76\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 4 October 2007. Almost a year after the jury returned that verdict, however, District Judge Michael J. Davis set the verdict aside, and ordered a new trial, on the ground that his instruction to the jurors‚Äîthat they did not need to find that any files were actually distributed in order to find a violation of plaintiffs' distribution right‚Äîwas a \\"manifest error of law\\".\\"RIAA's $222,000 verdict in Capitol v. Thomas set aside. Judge rejects 'making available'; attacks excessive damages.\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 24 September 2008. The Judge's 44-page decision agreed with Howell and London-Sire and rejected so much of Barker as intimated the existence of a viable \\"offer to distribute\\" theory. There may be indications that the RIAA has been jettisoning its \\"making available\\" theory. In a San Diego, California, case, Interscope v. Rodriguez, where the Judge dismissed the RIAA's complaint as \\"conclusory\\", \\"boilerplate\\", \\"speculation\\", the RIAA filed an amended complaint which contained no reference at all to \\"making available\\".\\"RIAA Abandons \\"Making Available\\" in Amended Complaint in Rodriguez case \\", Recording Industry vs. The People, 10 September 2007. In subsequent cases, the RIAA's complaint abandoned altogether the \\"making available\\" theory, following the model of the Interscope v. Rodriguez amended complaint. In its place, it is apparently adopting the \\"offer to distribute\\" theory suggested by Judge Karas. In the amended complaint the RIAA filed in Barker, it deleted the \\"making available\\" argument‚Äîas required by the judge‚Äîbut added an \\"offer to distribute\\" claim, as the judge had suggested.\\"Amended complaint filed in Elektra v. Barker\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 2 May 2008. It remains to be seen if it will follow that pattern in other cases. Secondary infringement liability Secondary liability, the possible liability of a defendant who is not a copyright infringer but who may have encouraged or induced copyright infringement by another, has been discussed generally by the United States Supreme Court in MGM v. Grokster, which held in essence that secondary liability could only be found where there has been affirmative encouragement or inducing behavior. On remand, the lower court found Streamcast, the maker of Morpheus software, to be liable for its customers' copyright infringements, based upon the specific facts of that case.\\"Streamcast Held Liable for Copyright Infringement in MGM v. Grokster, Round 2 \\", Recording Industry vs. The People, 30 September 2006. Under US law \\"the Betamax decision\\" (Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.), holds that copying \\"technologies\\" are not inherently illegal, if substantial non-infringing use can be made of them. Although this decision predated the widespread use of the Internet, in MGM v. Grokster, the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged the applicability of the Betamax case to peer-to- peer file sharing, and held that the networks could not be liable for merely providing the technology, absent proof that they had engaged in \\"inducement.\\" In 2006 the RIAA initiated its first major post-Grokster, secondary liability case, against LimeWire in Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC, where the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held that LimeWire induced copyright infringement and granted a permanent injunction against LimeWire. Electronic Frontier Foundation The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) seeks to protect and expand digital rights through litigation, political lobbying, and public awareness campaigns. The EFF has vocally opposed the RIAA in its pursuit of lawsuits against users of file sharing applications and supported defendants in these cases. The foundation promotes the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing of copyrighted materials and alternative methods to provide compensation to copyright holders. In September 2008 the organization marked the 5th 'anniversary' of the RIAA's litigation campaign by publishing a highly critical, detailed report, entitled \\"RIAA v. The People: Five Years Later\\", concluding that the campaign was a failure. Reported suspension of RIAA litigation campaign Several months later, it was reported that the RIAA was suspending its litigation campaign,\\"p2pnet reports that RIAA dropping 'mass lawsuits' to look for 'more effective ways' to combat copyright infringement\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 19 December 2008. followed by a report that it had fired the investigative firm SafeNet (formerly MediaSentry) operating on its behalf.\\"Wall Street Journal confirms that RIAA dumped MediaSentry\\" , Recording Industry vs. The People, 4 January 2009 Some of the details of the reports, including claims that the RIAA had actually stopped commencing new lawsuits months earlier, and that its reason for doing so was that it had entered into tentative agreements with Internet service providers to police their customers, proved to be either inaccurate or impossible to verify and RIAA's claim not to have filed new cases \\"for months\\" was false. Effects A study ordered by the European Union found that illegal downloading may lead to an increase in overall video game sales because newer games charge for extra features or levels. The paper concluded that piracy had a negative financial impact on movies, music, and literature. The study relied on self-reported data about game purchases and use of illegal download sites. Pains were taken to remove effects of false and misremembered responses. Notable cases ; EU * Atari Europe S.A.S.U. v.

Clifford joined the team during the 1968-69 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1973 championship. During that time he won one All- Ireland medal, two Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. Clifford was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Clifford was a one-time All-Ireland medalist with Glen Rovers. In addition to this he has also won one Munster medal and one county club championship medal. Playing career =Club= Clifford was originally part of the Cloyne GAA Club. He won various underage medals and captained cloyne to win an intermediate county in 1966. Clifford followed in the footsteps of another Cloyne man, namely the great Christy Ring, when he joined the famous Glen Rovers club on the north side of Cork city. He enjoyed much success with the club, and was a member of the panel when ‚Äòthe Glen‚Äô captured senior county championship titles in 1969, 1972 and 1976. This last win was later converted into both a Munster club title, as well as an All-Ireland club title. =Inter-county= Clifford first came to prominence as a hurler on the Cork minor team. He won a Munster minor title in 1964, which was quickly followed by an All-Ireland medal. Two years later in 1966 he won a second Munster medal with the Cork minor team. That year Clifford also made his debut for the Cork under-21 team, playing in the drawn All-Ireland final. Two years later in 1968 he won an All-Ireland medal with the under-21 side. In 1969 Clifford captured his only Munster under-21 medal on the field of play, before going on to win a second All-Ireland medal. By 1969 Clifford was also a member of the Cork senior hurling team. He began his senior career by winning a National Hurling League title. This was quickly followed by his first senior Munster title, however, Kilkenny later defeated Cork in the All-Ireland final. 1970 saw Clifford win his second National League title in-a-row. He also collected a second consecutive Munster title before playing in his second consecutive All- Ireland final. This time the opposition were Wexford and Cork made no mistake in capturing the title. Clifford played little part in inter-county action after this victory.

The route runs from PA 263 in Hatboro, Montgomery County east to PA 32 in Yardley, Bucks County. PA 332 runs through suburban areas to the north of Philadelphia, serving Warminster, Ivyland, Richboro, and Newtown. The route is two lanes wide most of its length, with the bypass around Newtown a four-lane divided highway. PA 332 intersects PA 132 in Warminster, PA 232 in Richboro, PA 413 and PA 532 in Newtown (all three run concurrently on the Newtown Bypass), and Interstate 295 (I-295) in Lower Makefield Township. What would become PA 332 between Newtown and Yardley was designated part of Legislative Route 252 in 1911. PA 332 was created in 1928 to run from PA 263 in Hatboro east to Ivyland with the road between Newtown and Yardley designated as part of PA 532\\\\. In 1937, PA 332 was extended to PA 113 in Newtown. The route was extended to Yardley in 1946, replacing PA 532\\\\. PA 332 was routed to bypass Newtown in 1991 when the eastern portion of the Newtown Bypass was completed. Route description PA 332 eastbound past East County Line Road in Warminster TownshipPA 332 begins at an intersection with PA 263 (North York Road) in the borough of Hatboro in Montgomery County, heading east on East Montgomery Avenue, a two-lane undivided roadway. The road passes through residential areas, crossing SEPTA's Warminster Line at-grade. Immediately after crossing the railroad tracks, the route turns northeast onto Jacksonville Road and runs through industrial areas with some homes and businesses. PA 332 intersects East County Line Road and it enters Warminster Township in Bucks County, gaining a center left-turn lane. The road passes between the Warminster station that serves as the terminus of SEPTA's Warminster Line to the west and the neighborhood of Warminster Heights to the east. The route loses the center turn lane before it widens to four lanes and crosses PA 132 as it continues near industrial parks. The road narrows back to two lanes past the Johnsville Boulevard intersection and enters the borough of Ivyland, heading past homes. The route becomes the border between Ivyland to the northwest and Warminster Township to the southeast prior to crossing Bristol Road into Northampton Township. PA 332 continues between industrial areas to the northwest and residential areas to the southeast, reaching an intersection with Almshouse Road in the community of Jacksonville. PA 332 eastbound past Hatboro Road in Northampton TownshipPA 332 turns southeast onto Almshouse Road and runs through a mix of farm fields and residences. Past the Hatboro Road intersection, the road curves to the east and gains a center left-turn lane, heading into Richboro. In Richboro, the route passes through business areas and intersects PA 232\\\\. Upon crossing PA 232, PA 332 changes its name to Newtown Richboro Road and continues past more homes as a two-lane road. The road forms the southern boundary of Tyler State Park, running between areas of fields and woods in the park to the north and residential subdivisions to the south and intersecting Holland Road. The route curves northeast and then east before crossing the Neshaminy Creek into Newtown Township. In this area, the road briefly widens into a divided highway before it comes to an intersection with PA 413/PA 532 at the Newtown Bypass, a road that provides a bypass of the borough of Newtown. PA 332 westbound past Main Street in Yardley At this point, PA 332 turns south onto the four-lane divided Newtown Bypass, forming a concurrency with PA 413/PA 532\\\\. The road heads through wooded areas with nearby residential development, with PA 532 splitting southwest onto Buck Road toward Holland. PA 332/PA 413 curve east, passing over Newtown Creek and coming to a bridge over Freedom Drive and the abandoned Fox Chase/Newtown railroad line. PA 413 splits from the bypass by turning south onto Newtown Langhorne Road toward the borough of Langhorne. PA 332 continues east near residential and commercial development a short distance to the north of the border between Newtown Township and Middletown Township, passing north of a shopping center that is served by an eastbound ramp. The road curves to the northeast at the Penns Trail/Woodbourne Road junction before turning east past the intersection with Newtown Yardley Road. Upon intersecting Lindenhurst Road/Campus Drive north of the Newtown Campus of Holy Family University, the route enters Lower Makefield Township and becomes Newtown Yardley Road. The road passes through farmland before heading north of an office park and reaching an interchange with I-295. Following this interchange, PA 332 becomes a two-lane undivided road and intersects Mirror Lake Road before it enters residential areas and crosses Buck Creek. The route reaches a junction with Yardley Langhorne Road and turns northeast onto Afton Avenue. PA 332 crosses into the borough of Yardley, where it is known as West Afton Avenue. The road heads into the downtown area and crosses Main Street, where the road name changes to East Afton Avenue, and the Delaware Canal. PA 332 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA 32, which runs along the west bank of the Delaware River. History PA 332 westbound along with northbound PA 413 and northbound PA 532 on the Newtown Bypass What would become PA 332 between Newtown and Yardley was designated as part of Legislative Route 252 in 1911, which continued southeast from Yardley to Morrisville. In 1928, PA 332 was designated to run from PA 263 in Hatboro east to Ivyland, with the portion of road between Newtown and Yardley designated as part of PA 532\\\\. Between Ivyland and Newtown, the road remained an unnumbered road that was paved with the exception of a portion west of Newtown. PA 332 was extended from Ivyland east to end at PA 113 (State Street) in Newtown in 1937, with the entire route paved by 1940. PA 332 entered Newtown from the west on Newtown-Richboro Road. In 1943, PA 332 within Warminster Township was widened as part of a military access road to Naval Air Development Center, Johnsville, costing $93,789. In 1946, PA 332 was extended east to Yardley, replacing that portion of PA 532\\\\. The route continued north from its previous eastern terminus on PA 413 (former PA 113, State Street) before turning east on Washington Street and leaving Newtown on Newtown Yardley Road. The portion of the Newtown Bypass carrying PA 332 west of PA 413 (Newtown Langhorne Road) was completed as part of a western bypass of Newtown for PA 413 in 1977. In September 1989, construction began to extend the Newtown Bypass east to the interchange between PA 332 and I-95 (now I-295). Construction on this bypass was completed in November 1991 at a cost of $16.6 million. With the completion of this bypass, PA 332 was routed to bypass Newtown. On April 22, 2014, the portion of PA 332 along the Newtown Bypass west of the PA 413 split at Newtown Langhorne Road was renamed the Officer Gregg Memorial Bypass in honor of Brian S. Gregg, a borough of Newtown police officer who was killed in the line of duty on September 29, 2005.

Malone joined the team during the 1971 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1978 championship. During that time he won two All- Ireland medals, four Munster medals, two National League medals and two All- Star awards. Malone was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Malone played with √âire √ìg. Playing career =Club= Malone played his club hurling and Gaelic football with √âire √ìg and enjoyed much success in a lengthy career. After winning a number of divisional championships in the early 1970s, √âire √ìg made a breakthrough at county level in 1977. A narrow 2‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Erin's Own gave Malone a junior championship medal. After securing promotion to intermediate status, √âire √ìg reached the championship decider in that grade in 1979. A high-scoring 7‚Äì11 to 5‚Äì8 defeat of Mallow gave Malone an intermediate championship medal. =Minor and under-21= Malone first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1967. He made his debut in the Munster quarter- final defeat of Waterford that year and later collected a Munster medal following a 4‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì3 rout of Limerick. Cork later faced Wexford in the All- Ireland decider. A 2‚Äì15 to 5‚Äì3 victory gave Malone an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. Cork retained the provincial title in 1968 with Malone collecting his second Munster medal following a high-scoring 7‚Äì8 to 5‚Äì4 defeat of Waterford. For the third successive Wexford provided the opposition in the All-Ireland decider and went on to claim a 2‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì7 victory. Malone progressed onto the Cork under-21 team in 1968 and enjoyed immediate success on one of the most successful teams of all-time in that grade. Tipperary were bested by 4‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì13 to secure a first Munster medal as Malone was introduced as a substitute. Cork later defeated Kilkenny by 2‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì9 and, in spite of being an unused substitute, Malone collected his first All-Ireland medal in that grade. In 1969 Cork had an even more comprehensive victory over Tipp in the provincial decider and Malone added a second Munster medal to his collection. Old rivals Wexford provided the opposition in the subsequent All- Ireland final and a high-scoring game ensued. A 5‚Äì13 to 4‚Äì7 victory gave Malone a second consecutive All-Ireland medal, however, once again he was an unused sub. Having retained the title, Cork set out to become the first team to win three successive under-21 championships. Malone collected a third Munster medal that year following a 3‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Tipperary once again. Cork faced their old rivals Wexford in the subsequent All-Ireland decider, however, that game ended in a draw. In the replay Malone was dropped from the starting fifteen, however, Cork went into overdrive and he won a third All-Ireland medal as an unused sub following a 5‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì8 thrashing. Malone was eligible for the under-21 grade once again in 1971, and added a fourth Munster medal to his collection as Tipp were downed once again. Wexford stood in the way of Cork securing a remarkable fourth successive championship and a high-scoring game ensued. A 7‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì11 victory gave Malone a record fourth All-Ireland medal, his first on the field of play. =Senior= Malone made his senior debut for Cork in a Munster semi-final defeat by Limerick in 1971 and immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen. Cork set down an early marker in 1972 and a narrow 3‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì14 defeat of Limerick in the decider gave Malone his first National Hurling League medal. A subsequent 6‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì8 thrashing of Clare gave him his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Cork face Kilkenny. The Rebels dominated the early exchanges and went eight points clear after a long-range score from wing-back Con Roche in the 17th minute of the second half. Remarkably they didn't didn't score again. Kilkenny took control with Pat Henderson a key figure at centre-back and Eddie Keher cutting loose up front. They were level after a Frank Cummins goal and went on to win by eight points. In 1974 Malone won a second National League medal as Cork defeated Limerick on a huge score line of 6‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì12 in the decider. After being dropped from the panel in 1975, Malone returned the following year and collected a second Munster medal as Limerick were bested once again. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork face old rivals Wexford. In one of the worst starts to a championship decider, Cork were 2‚Äì2 to no score in arrears after just six minutes. The Rebels fought back to level matters by half-time, however, it was the long-range point- scoring by Pat Moylan that turned the game for Cork. A 2‚Äì21 to 4‚Äì11 victory gave Malone his first All-Ireland medal. Malone was back on the starting fifteen in 1977. A 4‚Äì15 to 4‚Äì10 defeat of newly crowned National League champions Clare gave him a third Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider was a repeat of the previous year as Wexford stood in the way of a second successive title. Se√°nie O'Leary played the game with a broken nose after being hit in the face by a sliotar in a pre-match warm-up while the two oldest men on the team, Denis Coughlan and Gerald McCarthy, gave noteworthy displays. Martin Coleman made some miraculous saves in the dying minutes as Cork held on for a 1‚Äì17 to 3‚Äì8 victory. It was Malone's second All-Ireland medal. In 1978 Cork set out to secure an impressive third successive All- Ireland title. The team go off to a good start, however, Malone remained scoreless in a 0‚Äì13 to 0‚Äì11 defeat of Clare in a dour provincial decider. It was his fourth Munster medal. Malone subsequently left the panel and missed Cork's All-Ireland victory over Kilkenny. =Inter-provincial= Malone also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his sole appearance with the province in 1973, however, Leinster defeated Munster by 1‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8 in the Railway Cup decider.

It lies near the town P√©zenas. History Like many places in Languedoc-Roussillon, the village of Nizas has been continuously inhabited since prehistoric time. The vicinity of the village is rich in archeological sites, such as proto-anthropomorphic stele of Pla M√©jo and la grotte de l'Homme Mort,Jean Grimal. Le village chalcolithique du \\"Pla Mejo\\" Commune de Nizas (H√©rault), Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© pr√©historique fran√ßaise, 1966, n¬∞ 5, pp. 181-188. both from the Chalcolithic period. The origins of the village of Nizas are certainly Roman, although there are remains from Greek amphora manufacturing processes in neighbouring villages. There are evidences of Roman foundations from the 1st century AD under the early 18th-century church in the center of the village. The name Nizas derived from the name of a Latin nobleman Nisius whose domain is buried under the modern village. Nizas is mentioned in the Carolingian texts (884 AD) as a villa. Following the collapse of the Carolingian empire, Occitanian peasantry who, prior to 950 lived mostly at dispersed farms, regrouped around castles of local nobles for protection. Thus, the fortified villages or \\"castra\\" in Occitan, appeared between 950 and 1050.Les Cathares by de Brenon and Roux. Pouvoir et Societe en Francie occidentale en l'an Mil, p.25 \\"Castro Nizacio\\" is mentioned in time of crusades (1094‚Äì1114). The circulade is well preserved in the historical center of the village called quartier de la Villette. At the end of the 16th century, the Carrion family acquired the fief from the bishop of Lod√®ve and adopted the name Carrion-Nizas. That was Jean-Raymond de Carrion-Nizas ( d. 1624), master-builder of walls of P√©zenas, who built or re- built the current castle. The Carrion-Nizas family remained the lords of the village until the French Revolution. The tomb of the Carrion-Nizas family is still in the church chancel.

Sights The present village dates from the 10th century with extensive building in the 12th and 13th centuries giving the characteristic shape of a circulade. This is tight spiral configuration with the outer buildings having thick (up to 3 meters in places) stone walls as a defence. Since 2004, the historical district quartier de la Villette has been a pedestrian zone. The information below is largely based on the tourists signs. =Castrum tower= The tower is located in quartier de la Villette, the oldest part of Nizas. This four-sided tower (6.5 x 10 m) with walls 1.70m thick was originally surrounded by an enclosure which served as a farmyard to the old chateau. =Place du Griffe= From the 14th century onwards, the center of the village spread to the west of the original center (quartier de la Villette) around a new square ‚Äì the Place du Griffe. In this square, in the center of a fountain, there is a statue of Marianne which is more mythological than republican. She is the Greek-Roman goddess Artemis-Diana or Belissena, her counterpart in Celt Iberian cosmos of divinities. She isn't wearing phrygian cap, but a star on her forehead, suggesting the guiding light to lead people from the darkness of ignorance. =Church= The cornerstone of the present church was consecrated on January 13, 1705 on the site of the former chapel of Saints Perpetue and Felicity which was demolished in 1703. The construction work was completed by August 1708. Saint Perpetue relics are still objects of veneration.http://archives.herault.fr/cartes_postales-6598.html?btCom=200 The church is open for worship and visits only during the time of service.

Mina Kruseman, was born in Velp, Gelderland as the oldest of 4 daughters of Hendrik Georg KrusemanHuwelijksakte 1 van de Burgerlijke stand Gelderland, inventarisnummer 3239 Huwelijk tussen Hendrik G. Kruseman en Jennij D.H.C. Cantzlaar (1802Geboorteakte 88 van de Burgerlijke stand Gelderland, inventarisnummer 6054 Jennij D.H.C. Cantzlaar (moeder) en Hendrik G. Kruseman (vader) op de geboorteakte van Jennij D.H.C. Kruseman-1880) en Jennij Dorothe√© Hermine Cornelie Cantzlaar (1810‚Äì1859). H. G. Kruseman, who went on to serve in the Dutch army in the Dutch East Indies, took the family with him. Her growing up with three sisters in Samarang Dutch East Indies had some influence in her later writings. But those years she had a feeling of freedom. In her in 1877 published auto-biography Mijn leven (My life) there are a few citations, where she testifies of her happy life there. In 1854 the family returned to the Netherlands. Mina developed a deep aversion against the cold, small-city narrow-minded homeland and the restrictions that were imposed by decency, convention and religion, and certainly women were thereby the most affected. Other than her home country, she also spent a considerable part of her life in Belgium, France and United States. First performances as Stella Oristorio di Frama Mina wanted to do something with her life. Did however not know what in the beginning. In Brussels where she lived, she was accepted at the Conservatory for voice and piano. But after one year she did quit. After the death of two of her sisters, and a broken engagement. she decides to be an artist, globe-trotting along stages. She continues her education as a singer in Paris. In Europe she has only little success. In 1871 she decides therefore to go to America. The start was difficult, but in the end she experiences as Stella Oristorio di Frama in the South of the US some success-performances. Karcilla R√©na was another pseudonym used by Mina. Because the uncertain prospects she went in the summer of 1872 back to Brussels. In Paris published her first publication: a response to a woman-unfriendly piece by Alexandre Dumas, fils: Lettre a M. Alexandre Dumas fils au sujet de son livre l'Homme-femme (1872). In America she had already written her first novel. But it would take some time, before this was to be published. Back in Holland She started her career as a performing-artist in Holland. During her first appearance in the Hague November 1872 she reads them a chapter for from her forthcoming novel. Spring 1873 her fame in the rest of the Netherlands grows during her tour together with Betsy Perk. Other Dutch male authors had made likewise performances, reading from their own writings, into a serious source of income. Mina wanted her own economic independence, no chance of a free performance of Mina Kruseman. The text they used: Zusters. Een schetsje uit onze dagen (\\"Sisters. A sketch from our days.\\") was written by Mina especially for this occasion. It tells the story of 5 almost adult sisters, the education of girls and women's lives afterwards: waiting for a spouse, and when a marriage was not provided, a life as a spinster. Mina's tantalizing appearance and her widely acclaimed performance art was quite a happening in the early years of feminist Holland. In addition, Mina expressed severe criticism on the level of art-criticism in The Netherlands: real talents were driven out of the country: with Eduard Douwes Dekker, Multatuli as a prominent example. Multatuli Dekker was very pleased with this praise. He wrote to his publisher and friend G.L.Funke: I would like to thank her and bring her my compliments Multatuli, \\"Volledige Werken\\", 25 vols, Amsterdam 1950‚Äì1995, VW XV, p.698 Another letter of Dekker ‚Äì very encouraging ‚Äì reached Mina with the help of Funke. Mina had started reading Multatuli's Max Havelaar, during her stay in America. She found in it \\"strength, feeling and truth\\". She was inspired by this when she wrote her first novel. In it, she describes the repressive upbringing of girls, to makes them ready for marriage, and all the duties thereafter. Mina had a lot more in common with Dekker, his thoughts about morals, religion, his humor, and his fight for the weak in society. The criticism made to her, that she was too much under Dekker's influence, she did not mind that at all, just found it a biggest compliment ever. The day, she got Dekker's letter, she immediately replied to him: No letter, from anybody else, could have made me more happy, than yours Mijn leven, II, 1 A few months later, she visited Dekker in Wiesbaden Germany, together with her feminist friend Betsy Perk. School of Princes Mina Kruseman (1875) This was the start of a close friendship between Eduard Douwes Dekker and Mina Kruseman. Mina had wishes to be an actrice, so she started a lobby to bring Dekker's play Vorstenschool (School of Princes) into the theatre. This play was published years before in 1872, as the start of IDEEN-IV. Although the play raised much attention, no theatre company in Holland dared to start with it. In 1875 Mina could make a contract with a starting theatre compagny in Rotterdam \\"De nieuwe Rotterdamsche Schouwburg\\". Mina played for some time the leading role as queen Louise. The tour was a big success. Multatuli was recognized and celebrated as a big author, he was asked on stage and applauded by the audience. Even raised ticket prices did not keep people away. Enemies for life It was however also the reason of the hate between Mina and Dekker in their later life.Annet Mooij: Het verraad van een zielsverwant (The betrayal of a soul mate), in: De minotaurus onzer zeden (The Minotaur of our morals), Aksant, Amsterdam, 2010, After some time Mina discovered that another actrice Nans Sandrock-ten Hagen of the group was preparing to take over her Louise-role. Although at first this was denied, soon Mina was put aside. Her claim of 3000 gulden, was denied to her on 4 mei 1875 by the Rotterdam court. The new \\"Louise\\" had only little success and the tour came to an end. Mina was very disappointed, in 1877 she published her three volumes book Mijn Leven (My Life), to close her time in Holland. Multatuli... He had always insisted, that he never had admired her, never had he any faith attached to her acting talent. Now it appeared all too obvious to the contrary. She had left a bomb for all her sworn enemies, but did not wait at all for the critics. On 1 September 1877 she said good bye to Holland and went to the Dutch East Indies for the rest of her life until her death in 1922 she never touched Dutch soil. In one of the last pages of her book she wrote: I can look back on my past without repentance, I am happy with my present, my future I will meet without illusions, but also without fear. What do you want more? A feminist in the tropics Newspapers in the Dutch colonies were informed about the arrival of Mina. On 12 October 1877 the Algemeen Dagblad van Nederlands Indie mentions the plans of Mina to come and stay for 10 years. 18 October she arrived with the Princes Amalia of the Nederlandsche Stoombootmaatschappij in Batavia. At that moment also copies of her book Mijn leven were available. Soon the first reviews were published. Many blame her indiscretion, superficial, overconfidence, but usually it is considered rather positive. Afterlife In 1881 she did meet the writer, photographer and musician F.J. Hoffman. Olf Praamstra, Een Feminist in de tropen, de Indische jaren van Mina Kruseman,KITLV, 2003, Uitgeverij, Leiden, He was a pupil of Mina, in his twenties (22) and Mina Kruseman in her forties. But Mina had a rather big house, and in this way they could keep their relation secret for the local community. Only after they left in 1883 the Dutch East Indies during their voyage to europe, a daughter was born. 5 November 1883 the Soerabaya Courant mentions the birth and the \\"marriage\\" of Mina and Frits. But nothing could be found in the Singapore marriage registers of this period. According to Mina they lived three and a half year in Naples. Here another girl was born. Both children died at a young age. The couple then settled in Boulogne-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris which now, after the merger with the city of Billancourt, is called Boulogne-Billancourt. They lived by Hoffmans merits as a photographer and violin teacher and later, after he had lost his work as a photographer, of the music classes and an annuity of Mina Kruseman. Hoffman died in 1918. Her health worsened, she was infirm and after 1920 she almost never left her house anymore. In 1922 she died on the age of 82. For her role as feminist she was honored by a large number of municipalities in the Netherlands, that have named a street after her including: Arnhem, Coevorden, Delft, Enschede, Hoorn, Leiden, Spijkenisse, Tiel, Venray, Venlo, Tilburg, Waalwijk, Zaanstad, a lane in Deventer, a channel in Veenendaal, a road in Tilburg or a square in Dordrecht.

He worked for the British East India Company, (EIC) and mapped many seaways around Singapore in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Life Born at Elie, Fife, Horsburgh went to sea at the age of 16 and was captured and imprisoned by the French at Dunkirk. After his release, he made voyages to the West Indies and Calcutta. In May 1786, aboard the EIC ship Atlas he sailed from Batavia to Ceylon as first mate and was subsequently shipwrecked on the island of Diego Garcia. This disaster influenced him in his decision to produce accurate maps after he found his way back to India and while on board another ship employed in trade with China. James Horsburgh was the author of the precisely titled Directions for Sailing to and from the East Indies, China, New Holland, Cape of Good Hope, and the interjacent Ports, compiled chiefly from original Journals and Observations made during 21 years' experience in navigating those Seas, also known as the 'India Directory'.Alfred C. Haddon, Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits-Vol 1 General Ethnography Horsburgh's Directory became the standard work for oriental navigation in the first half of the 19th century, until Robert Moresby's survey of the treacherous coral groups in the central Indian Ocean, when for the first time in history accurate maps of the areas that were in the way of the main trade routes: the Maldives, Chagos and Laccadives, were published. In March, 1806 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society Legacy Robert Moresby, during his survey of the Maldives in 1834, named a small atoll south of Southern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll after James Horsburgh as a homage to his valuable previous hydrographic work. Horsburgh Island in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands is also named after him as is the Horsburgh Lighthouse, located on Pedra Branca, Singapore, the construction of which was funded by a group of British merchants in Canton, China (now Guangzhou). Horsburgh was the first to document the island now known as Spratly Island, naming it Storm Island. However, Richard Spratly's sighting eventually become the vernacular and led to the naming of the entire region as the Spratly Islands.

Gaster assumed that the text predates the 11th century, based on a letter by Rav Hai Gaon (939-1038) which mentions the book alongside the Sefer ha-Yashar, described as another book of formulas, and that it may even date to as early as the first four centuries CE. Besides the medieval manuscript used by Gaster, a short fragment of the text survives in Cod. Oxford 1531. A new critical edition was printed in 1997 by the Israeli scholar Yuval Harari based on a variant text found in another manuscript. An English translation of the same was published in 2012. Yuval Harari, The Sword of Moses (·∏§arba de-Moshe): A New Translation and Introduction  Contents  The largest manuscript of the Sword of Moses begins with a description of the heavenly realms and angels, and soon moves onto describing various prayers, invocations, and ritual procedures that the reader is to perform before he is able to use the \\"Sword\\"; this term refers to a huge list of magical names later in the text, divided into 136 sections, each with a different magical use. The list of names is given first, followed by its uses in the next section: > [1]If at a full moon you wish to seize and to bind a man and a woman so that > they will be with each other, and to annul spirits and blast-demons and > satans, and to bind a boat, and to free a man from prison, and for every > thing, write on a red plate from TWBR TSBR until H‚Äô B≈†MHT.[2] And if you > wish to destroy high mountains and to pass (in safety) through the sea and > the land, and to go down into fire and come up, and to remove kings, and to > cause an optical illusion, and to stop up a mouth, and to converse with the > dead, and to kill the living, and to bring down and raise up and adjure > angels to abide by you, and to learn all the secrets of the world, write on > a silver plate, and put in it a root of artemisia, from TWBR TSBR until > H‚ÄôB≈†MHT.

Clutter folding becomes a problem when the range extent of the clutter (seen by the radar) exceeds the pulse repetition frequency interval of the radar, and it no longer provides adequate clutter suppression, and the clutter \\"folds\\" back in range. The solution to this problem is usually to add fill pulses to each coherent dwell of the radar, increasing the range over which clutter suppression is applied by the system. The tradeoff for doing this is that adding fill pulses will degrade the performance, due to wasted transmitter power and a longer dwell time.

History This light was constructed in 1885 as part of a range light pair to mark the then newly excavated Craighill Cutoff Channel. A modest iron skeleton tower was erected, pyramidal in form with a wooden, corrugated iron- sheathed square shaft at its center to house the lamp and the access stairway. Its only architectural ornaments were a few windows to light the stairwell and a gallery to allow the outside of the light's window to be cleaned. A keeper's house was built nearby, connected to the light by a brick walk. The original light was a locomotive headlight displaying a fixed white light; this has since been replaced with a more conventional fixture displaying a red light. The grounds were (and are) surrounded by private property, and in 1888 there was a dispute over access to the light. Other than that the light has passed a quiet life, punctuated only by automation in 1929 and the demolition of the keeper's house. It is still an active aid to navigation.

The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal is awarded to those persons who define the 21st century and exemplify the best qualities of the human spirit. The Medal is awarded on each Senior Class Day to persons chosen by Vanderbilt's Chancellor with the advice of the faculty and students. Senior Class Day is the day before Vanderbilt's spring undergraduate commencement. In 2020, Senior Class Day was renamed Graduates Day to be more inclusive to all Vanderbilt students, including graduate, professional and undergraduate students, who will earn a degree the following day. The Medal includes a cash award and is one of the university's highest honors. History The tradition of Senior Class Day was started by Chancellor Gordon Gee, and the first Senior Class Day was in 2004. Vanderbilt awarded The Chancellor's Medal to Condoleezza Rice and Shirin Ebadi on Senior Class Day in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal replaced The Chancellor's Medal in 2006. The first Nichols-Chancellor's Medal was awarded that year to disaster relief workers around the world and was accepted on their behalf by the first lady of the United States, Laura Bush. The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal was created and endowed by Edward and Janice Nichols in memory of Ed's parents, Edward Carmack Nichols and Lucile Hamby Nichols. In 2009, a permanent endowment fund known as The Edward and Janice Nichols Endowment Fund was established at Vanderbilt to fund The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal and The Nichols Humanitarian Fund in perpetuity. Nichols Humanitarian Fund The Nichols Humanitarian Fund is a companion scholarship fund to The Nichols- Chancellor's Medal. The purpose of fund is to enable Vanderbilt students to volunteer for humanitarian causes. The fund awards scholarships based on merit and need to Vanderbilt students to pay the expenses of their humanitarian activities. It was established by Edward and Janice Nichols in 2006 in honor of Laura Bush's speech on Senior Class Day. The $100,000 cash prize that accompanied The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal that Mrs. Bush accepted was given to Vanderbilt to start the fund. The fund also receives substantial contributions each year from The Edward and Janice Nichols Endowment Fund. The first scholarships were awarded in 2007. Mission The Nichols-Chancellor's Medal and Nichols Humanitarian Fund seek to make Vanderbilt students better members of their communities and society in general by supporting their humanitarian activities and bringing speakers to Vanderbilt who embody the best of humanity.

It was founded as a settlement for German immigrants along the Guadalupe River. Geography Hochheim is located at , above sea level. It is located on the Texas Coastal Plain. History The Guadalupe River passes through the town, and the present-day site is believed to be the location that Spanish explorers including Alonso de Leon, used to cross the river. √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca is regarded as the first European to encounter the river at this location circa 1528. He named it, \\"The River of Nuts\\" due to the large concentration of pecan trees that grow naturally along the river's banks. In 1848, Valentine Hoch, a German immigrant from the disputed Alsace-Lorraine region, traveled to the rolling hills near the lower Guadalupe River with his son, after arriving in America at the port of Indianola, Texas. Upon arrival to the hills, Hoch remarked: \\"Here we shall build our home.\\" Construction of the home soon began from the stones at the Guadalupe River bed, and was completed several years thereafter. Others with surnames that included Crawford, Helms, Humphrey, Steen, Morrisse, Times, and Schwab, began to build homes and establish businesses in the area; soon the community of Hochheim was established. The name could be translated to mean \\"Hoch's home\\" for the earliest settler, or \\"High home\\" for the fact that Hoch constructed his home on a hill. Townspeople also referred to the settlement as \\"Dutchtown\\". Historical marker After the Schwab family opened a general store and gin, Hochheim became a trade stop between Indianola and Austin. A railroad was constructed through the town connecting the two cities. By 1870, the town had two grocery stores, a drugstore and a blacksmith shop. That year, a post office was established in the town. Sometime between 1870 and 1880, a Masonic Lodge was built at the turn of the century that served as a school, church and community center. The German Methodist Church was present in the town as early as 1864, and a Presbyterian church moved to the city in 1882, remaining in the town until 1961. By 1885, 200 people lived in Hochheim with ten businesses operating in the area. The population reached its peak of 261 in 1904, and dwindled to around 100 between the 1920s and 1950s. Valentine Hoch's home was restored to its original state in 1953 after being damaged during a 1934 storm. It has been recognized with a Texas Medallion by the Texas Historical Society. By the 1980s, Hochheim's population had fallen to 70 and only one business remained.

Seguignol also played 8 years in Nippon Professional Baseball. A switch hitter, Seguignol is regarded as the best switch-hitter ever to play in Japan, along with Orestes Destrade. Biography Seguignol was signed as an amateur free agent in by the New York Yankees at the age of 18. Yankees minor league manager Trey Hillman recommended Seguignol try switch-hitting. (Years later, Hillman became the manager of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, and was reunited with Seguignol in Japan.) He spent several years in the minors before making his major league debut in with the Montreal Expos after being traded by the Yankees on April 5, 1995 along with cash, for John Wetteland. He played a career high 76 games in with the Expos, hitting .278 with 10 home runs and 22 RBI playing in the outfield. Seguignol was released by the Expos in , and signed with the Orix BlueWave of the Japanese Pacific League in . He made appearances as a first baseman and designated hitter with the BlueWave, and hit home runs from both sides of the plate two games in a row, from June 5 to June 6 (becoming the first player to do so in Japanese baseball history). However, Seguignol was inconsistent overall, ending the season with a .204 batting average. He was released at the end of the season, and returned to the major leagues after signing with the New York Yankees. He spent most of with the Yankees' Triple-A affiliate Columbus Clippers, and led the league in home runs and RBI (he played in five major league games that year with the Yankees). He was scouted by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, and traveled to Japan for the second time in . He hit well over .400 in his first month, and ended the year hitting .306 with 44 home runs and 108 RBI, tying Nobuhiko Matsunaka for the most home runs in the league to win the Best Nine Award at designated hitter. He remained with the Fighters until , and had continued success, leading the league in doubles in to win a second Best Nine Award. In , he played for Olmecas de Tabasco in Liga Mexicana de Beisbol before signing with the Detroit Tigers on June 12, 2008; he was released by the Tigers on July 21. But about a week after his release, he was acquired by the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. He hit 13 home runs in 39 games (157 at-bats), with a .324 batting average and 40 RBI in that season. He was chosen on the 1st round roster for Panama team playing in 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2010, after playing for the Newark Bears, he played for the Orix Buffaloes in the Japanese Pacific League, where he had previously played in 2002. Seguignol holds the Japanese single-season record for home runs among switch-hitters (44), and homered from both sides of the plate eight separate times in Japan, an NPB all-time record.

He was the principal financier of the Confederate government of Kentucky during the Civil War. Early life Eli Metcalfe Bruce was born near Flemingsburg, Kentucky, the son George S. and Sabina Metcalfe Bruce. He was educated at the local schools until 1847 when he began working at a dry goods store in Maysville, Kentucky. Shortly thereafter, he relocated to Northern Kentucky, where he worked at a pork packing factory owned by his uncle in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1853, Bruce married Elizabeth Sally Withers, and the couple had three children. The following year, he and his uncle opened an iron furnace business near Terre Haute, Indiana. In 1859, he sold his interest in the iron furnace company and purchased several pork packing plants along the Mississippi, Missouri, and Wabash Rivers. These entrepreneurial endeavors left Bruce a wealthy young man. Civil War Near the outbreak of the Civil War, Bruce sold all of his enterprises in the north and moved to the south. A Confederate sympathizer, Bruce attended a secession convention in Russellville, Kentucky, in November 1861, and was elected to the legislative council of the Commonwealth's Confederate shadow government. When Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy in December 1861, Bruce was elected to one of the Commonwealth's ten congressional seats. He personally financed many of the supply needs of Kentucky's Orphan Brigade. His work in negotiating prisoner exchanges for this unit led to his being asked to negotiate such exchanges for the entire Confederate States Army. Near the end of the war, Bruce and Jefferson Davis fled the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. He was later captured in Georgia, but with the end of the war, he was released and established an office in Augusta, Georgia, with the intent of helping Confederate soldiers return home. On May 10, 1865, he published an open letter offering to pay the educational expenses of any Confederate soldier who had lost an arm or leg in the war. All told, it was estimated that Bruce contributed $400,000 for the relief of Confederate soldiers. He was pardoned of any wrongdoing with regards to his support of the Southern cause by President Andrew Johnson. Later life and death Bruce financed the merger of two Louisville, Kentucky, newspapers - The Courier and The Journal - into The Courier-Journal. He later moved to New York City, New York, where he became a cotton broker and opened a hotel for the use of former Confederate soldiers. He continued to augment his fortune through wise investments, and shortly after the war, an abandoned South Carolina gold mine in which he had invested struck a new vein. Bruce died of heart disease on December 15, 1866, and was buried in Linden Grove Cemetery in Covington, Kentucky. In 1917, his body was exhumed and reburied near his wife and daughter in Highland Cemetery in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky. The Northern Kentucky chapter of Sons of Confederate Veterans is named in his honor.

The BCO was established by Environment Canada in September 1991 to coordinate Canadian involvement in the negotiations of the Convention. Following Canada's ratification of the Convention in December 1992, attention shifted to development of a Canadian response. Under the guidance of the BCO, a Federal- Provincial-Territorial Working Group was charged by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment with developing the Canadian Biodiversity Strategy. In 1996, all jurisdictions signed a statement of commitment to use the Strategy as a guide to implementing the Convention in Canada. In 2005, Ministers instructed the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Working Group to develop a corresponding outcomes-based framework for guiding and monitoring implementation of the Canadian Biodiversity Strategy. This Biodiversity Outcomes Framework was approved by Ministers responsible for Environment, Forests, Parks, Fisheries and Aquaculture, and Wildlife in October 2006. The BCO plays a policy coordinating, catalysing and facilitating role in national efforts to define Canada's response to the Convention and National Strategy. It operates through a network of contacts within and outside government. At the federal level, an Interdepartmental Committee on Biodiversity provides advice and guidance on domestic and international policy issues. The Federal/Provincial/Territorial Biodiversity Working Group focuses on national biodiversity issues. BCO also works with indigenous groups to enable their participation in meeting the objectives of the Convention and the Canadian Biodiversity Strategy.

She showed artistic talent at a very young age and was only 13 when she drew Saint Catherine as part of a window for the Lady Chapel of Gloucester Cathedral. Whall, her mother, and her siblings were often used by her father as models for his stained glass designs. Whall attended the L.C.C. Central School of Arts and Crafts, including classes taught by her father. Like other talented students at the school, Whall worked as a student apprentice at her father's studio-workshop.Halls: Stained Glass Windows by Veronica Whall.

A member of one of the so- called ‚Äútwelve apostolic‚Äù families, he was married to Felicia Cornaro, who had influence on his politics. Staley, Edgcumbe: The dogaressas of Venice : The wives of the doges. London : T. W. Laurie Life When Pope Urban II initiated the First Crusade, Vitale I Michiel did not initially urge Venice‚Äôs support, perhaps because he could not see the advantages to Venice of such an expedition. The leader of the crusade, Godfrey of Bouillon (Goffredo di Buglione), along with his older brother, Eustace III of Boulogne, and younger brother Baldwin, left southern Italy in August 1096, with a contingent of 120 ships and (legendarily) 40,000 troops from all over Europe. When Doge Vitale I Michiel saw the European commitment to the First Crusade, he then understood the war‚Äôs economic importance. In particular, he foresaw that it was vital to Venice‚Äôs trade advantage to participate in territorial conquest, lest these advantages inure to the benefit of other marine republics. In July 1099, 207 ships sailed from Venice to support the First Crusade. Doge Vitale I Michiel appointed his son, Vitale Giovanni, and the Bishop of Castello, Enrico Contarini, as the fleet‚Äôs commanders. In December 1099, at Rhodes, the Venetian fleet intercepted enemy ships and sank them. In the spring of 1100, the Venetian fleet headed towards the Levant, where in the meantime, Godfrey of Bouillon and his troops had taken Jerusalem. Enemy ships had cut off Godfrey‚Äôs ability to receive aid and he was forced to negotiate with the Venetians. In exchange for its services, Venice obtained the right to maintain a quarter not subject to custom offices, taxes, or excise taxes in every conquered city or territory. In 1101, Vitale I Michiele interceded in favor of Mathilde of Tuscany in regards to the purchase of Ferrara, and obtained generous trade concessions as a result. He died in the spring of 1102 and was buried at St. Mark‚Äôs Basilica.

She survived the First World War and was sold in July 1932. She returned to Pembroke to be broken up. Construction Spartiate was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard, and launched on 27 October 1898, when she was christened by Mrs. Burges Watson, wife of Captain Burges Watson, Captain Superintendent of the yard. She was delivered at Portsmouth from Pembroke dockyard in April, 1900, and in the following winter went on her trials. Sand in the condensers led to friction in her machinery, and her engines had to be re-constructed. New trials the following year ended with her condenser tubes leaking so badly they had to be replaced with new ones before she could be ready. A third attempt at trials in April 1902 was also abandoned, but she finally completed her trials in July that year, and was ready for sea in March 1903. Service history Spartiate was commissioned in 1903 for service in home waters. The previous year she had been mentioned as a possible flagship for the Australia Station, but this never happened (possibly due to the delay in her trials).

An advocate of feminism and the democratization of Jewish communal life, Cantor has been actively involved in promoting progressive Jewish causes for over 40 years. She was a co-founder in 1968 of the Jewish Liberation in New York, a Socialist Zionist organization, and served as founding editor of its Jewish Liberation Journal. JLP was among the first Jewish groups to advocate the two- state solution (1968). Biography Aviva Cantor was born in 1940 and raised in the East Bronx by traditional but non-Orthodox parents who had immigrated to North America from Russia after World War I. She attended Ramaz School, an Orthodox Jewish day school, graduating from High School as Valedictorian in 1957. She spent two years studying history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and graduated from Barnard College in 1961 and from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in 1963. In the late 1969's she was involved in advocating for the struggle of Biafra for independence and served as vice president of the Committee for Biafran Artist and Writers. In 1976, she initiated and co-founded Lilith, the independent Jewish Feminist quarterly magazine, which she served as co-founding editor through 1987, and for which she wrote regularly. Her articles have appeared in many publications, including Ms., The Village Voice, and Israel Horizons, and in a number of anthologies. Her reportage for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) on the American Jewish community, Israel, her multi-part series on foreign Jewish communities‚Äîincluding Cuba, Argentina, Austria, Central Europe and Kenya‚Äîand her interviews with figures such as Gerhard Riegner, Carl Sagan, David Wyman, and Renee Epelbaum, were internationally syndicated. Writing Cantor has written five alternative Passover ceremonies, the fourth of which she co- conducted in the Bedford Hills Women's Prison. The fifth one, The Egalitarian Hagada, was self-published under the auspices of Beruriah Books. It is a gender- and generation-inclusive Haggadah in non-sexist English containing all the memorable traditional elements of the seder plus poetry and prose about the Exodus, Israel, the Soviet Jewry movement, struggles for justice, the Holocaust and Resistance, and the American union movement. After teaching the first Jewish feminist course in the Jewish Free High School in 1972, she compiled, edited and annotated several editions of The Jewish Woman, 1900‚Äì1985: A Bibliography, the 4th of which was published by BiblioPress in 1986 and 1987. Her children's book manuscript, Tamar's Cat: A Story of the Exodus, won first prize in the Sydney Taylor Children's Book Manuscript Contest of the Association of Jewish Libraries in 1991. She is also the author of several plays, including Esther and the Three Fools: A Feminist Purimshpiel; Moses and Tziporah with the Pesky Ex-Slaves in the Desert; and Hamlet's Secrets, a comedy. In 1995, HarperSan Francisco published her major 548-pp. work, Jewish Women/Jewish Men: the Legacy of Patriarchy in Jewish Life, a feminist exploration of Jewish history, culture and psychology (which has 100 pages of endnotes). The work puts traditional and modern Jewish life under a feminist microscope. One of her central theses is that the needs for Jewish survival in the \\"national emergency\\" of 2,000 years of exile under oppressive and dangerous conditions necessitated the transformation of local communities into milieus informed by the feminist values of non-violence, cooperation, interdependence, compassion, and consensus. The ideal Jewish man changed \\"from macho to mentsch\\" through the outlawing of violence of all kinds and the redefinition of masculinity as learning and scholarship. At the same time, women were allowed a considerable amount of leeway in assertiveness, but only if it was in the interests of communal survival. She was trained to be an \\"altruistic-assertive enabler\\" (in the common, traditional meaning of the word \\"enabler\\" i.e., facilitator). Men, of course, never ceased to dominate the community, decide on its policy and laws, and choose its leadership (class played a role here). Cantor believes that this successful transformation of roles and communal life proves that men's instinct for violence, even if it turns out to be genetic, can be overcome if men and women are sufficiently motivated and conscious of the justice of a peaceful, egalitarian world, in the spirit of the prophet Isaiah's vision. Other activities Cantor is also active in the animal protectionist movement and is Vice President of \\"CHAI:Concern for Helping Animals in Israel,\\" founded by Nina Natelson in 1984 to assist the Israeli animal welfare community in improving conditions for domestic animals in a country with only a few SPCAs and many immigrant communities with no tradition of animal protection and an ongoing war situation. It drafted Israel's animal protection law; conducted several humane education programs (including one for Jewish and Arab children at the Tel Aviv SPCA), site of the IB. Singer Humane Education Center which it built; and held important conferences, including one for educators on the links between the abuse of animals, domestic violence, and the criminal behavior of adults who tortured animals as children, and another on alternatives to the use of animals in experimentation. CHAI built a shelter in Tiberias, maintains a mobile spay-neuter program and a horse rehabilitation program. It and its Israeli sister organization, HAKOL CHAI, rescued countless dogs and cats hurt or abandoned in the attacks on Sderot. The late Rep. Tom Lantos, who served on CHAI's Advisory Board, was a warm supporter of its work, as was Nobel Prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer. Cantor wrote a 10-lesson Humane Education unit drawing entirely on Jewish sources, which forbade cruelty to animals (though Judaism permitted slaughtering for food, Jewish law required that the process was to be as close to painless as possible; this situation does not largely obtain today, especially in South America\\"Jewish Vegetarian Society\\"). In the 1980s she initiated an ultimately successful Women's Appeal for the release of Soviet Prisoner of Conscience Ida Nudel. Personal life Cantor was married for 38 years to journalist Murray Zuckoff, a self-described \\"revolutionary,\\" Socialist Zionist and crusading investigative journalist (reporter for the Paterson Morning Call and editor of the JTA), who fought for truth and justice with his pen. He was also a devoted teacher at CUNY. Zuckoff loved Israel, Yiddish, cats. books, music, folk art and Star Trek. He died in 2004. Cantor also composes liturgical music and photographs her cat as a hobby.  References   Bibliography  *Cantor, Aviva. The Jewish Woman, 1900‚Äì1985: A Bibliography.

Plot Sam Whipple, a broke lawyer who is nevertheless young at heart, meets Santa Claus and learns that he is upset because he has a new landlord named Phineas T. Prune, to whom Santa owes a lot of rent. Prune has threatened to confiscate Santa's toys and have him, Mrs. Claus and the elves evicted. In order to raise money, Sam and Santa get jobs at a department store, where working for two days will somehow earn enough money to pay all of the entire rent that is due. Santa is nervous at first, but when the children arrive, they naturally gravitate to him and he becomes a big success. Prune schemes to thwart Sam and Santa's plans. He buys the department store, has his butler destroy several of the toys and takes the damages out of Santa and Sam's paychecks. He gloats that Santa will never be able to pay his rent on time. Now broke again, Sam and Santa fear Christmas will be canceled. A little boy passes them on the street and asks them what is the matter. When Sam explains, the little boy calls out to the city's children to help Santa. All of the children pour into the streets and give what money they can . . . more than enough to pay all of the rent that is due. Santa pays Prune his rent at the last minute. Then Santa, Mrs. Claus and Sam deliver the gifts together. They are surprised to discover that the very last gift is addressed to none other than Prune. They arrive at Prune's home and Santa offers him the gift. He opens it and is moved to find that it is the toy sailboat that he had wanted as a boy. A letter from Santa's head elf apologizes for the clerical error that resulted in Santa never visiting him as a child. Prune rediscovers his holiday spirit and runs into the street wishing everyone a merry Christmas, bewildering the townsfolk with his enthusiasm.

Blocked fallopian tubes are unable to let the ovum and the sperm converge, thus making fertilization impossible. Fallopian tubes are also known as oviducts, uterine tubes, and salpinges (singular salpinx). Types Approximately 20% of female infertility can be attributed to tubal causes. Distal tubal occlusion (affecting the end towards the ovary) is typically associated with hydrosalpinx formation and often caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Pelvic adhesions may be associated with such an infection. In less severe forms, the fimbriae may be agglutinated and damaged, but some patency may still be preserved. Midsegment tubal obstruction can be due to tubal ligation procedures as that part of the tube is a common target of sterilization interventions. Proximal tubal occlusion can occur after infection such as a septic abortion. Also, some tubal sterilization procedures such as the Essure procedure target the part of the tube that is near the uterus. Causes Most commonly a tube may be obstructed due to infection such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The rate of tubal infertility has been reported to be 12% after one, 23% after two, and 53% after three episodes of PID. The Fallopian tubes may also be occluded or disabled by endometritis, infections after childbirth and intra-abdominal infections including appendicitis and peritonitis. The formation of adhesions may not necessarily block a fallopian tube, but render it dysfunctional by distorting or separating it from the ovary. It has been reported that women with distal tubal occlusion have a higher rate of HIV infection. Fallopian tubes may be blocked as a method of contraception. In these situations tubes tend to be healthy and typically patients requesting the procedure had children. Tubal ligation is considered a permanent procedure. Diagnosis While a full testing of tubal functions in patients with infertility is not possible, testing of tubal patency is feasible. A hysterosalpingogram will demonstrate that tubes are open when the radioopaque dye spills into the abdominal cavity. Sonography can demonstrate tubal abnormalities such as a hydrosalpinx indicative of tubal occlusion. During surgery, typically laparoscopy, the status of the tubes can be inspected and a dye such as methylene blue can be injected in a process termed chromotubation into the uterus and shown to pass through the tubes when the cervix is occluded. Laparoscopic chromotubation has been described as the gold standard of tubal evaluation. As tubal disease is often related to Chlamydia infection, testing for Chlamydia antibodies has become a cost-effective screening device for tubal pathology. Tubal insufflation is only of historical interest as an older office method to indicate patency; it was used prior to laparoscopic evaluation of pelvic organs. Treatment Treatment of fallopian tube obstruction has traditionally been treated with fallopian tubal surgery (tuboplasty) with a goal of restoring patency to the tubes and thus possibly normal function. A common modern day method of treatment is in vitro fertilization as it is more cost-effective, less invasive, and results are immediate. Alternative methods such as manual physical therapy are also cited for the ability to open and return function to blocked fallopian tubes in some women. Treatments such as assisted reproductive technologies are used more often than surgery. =Tuboplasty= Tuboplasty refers to a number of surgical operations that attempt to restore patency and functioning of the so that a pregnancy could be achieved. As tubal infertility is a common cause of infertility, tuboplasties were commonly performed prior to the development of effective in vitro fertilization (IVF). Different types of tuboplasty have been developed and can be applied by laparoscopy or laparotomy. They include lysis of adhesions, fimbrioplasty (repairing the fimbriated end of the tubes), salpinostomy (creating an opening for the tube), resection and reananstomosis (removing a piece of blocked tube and reuniting the remaining patent parts of the tube), and tubal reimplantation (reconnecting the tube to the uterus). Further, using fluoroscopy or hysteroscopy proximal tubal occlusion can be overcome by unilateral or bilateral selective tubal cannulation, a procedure where a thin catheter is advanced through the proximal portion of the fallopian tube os to examine and possibly restore tubal patency salpinostomy (creating an opening for the tube) or falloposcopy. Results of tubal surgery are inversely related to damage that exists prior to surgery. Development of adhesions remains a problem. Patients with operated tubes are at increased risk for ectopic pregnancy., although in vitro fertilization in patients with damaged tubes is also associated with a risk for ectopic pregnancy. =In vitro fertilization= In vitro fertilisation is a process by which an egg is fertilised by sperm outside the body: in vitro. IVF is a major treatment for infertility when other methods of assisted reproductive technology have failed. The process involves monitoring a woman's ovulatory process, removing ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a fluid medium in a laboratory. When a woman's natural cycle is monitored to collect a naturally selected ovum (egg) for fertilisation, it is known as natural cycle IVF. The fertilised egg (zygote) is then transferred to the patient's uterus with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy. While IVF therapy has largely replaced tubal surgery in the treatment of infertility, the presence of hydrosalpinx is a detriment to IVF success. It has been recommended that prior to IVF, laparoscopic surgery should be done to either block or remove hydrosalpinges.

PA 513 has intermediate junctions with PA 132 in Bensalem Township and US 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) in Penndel. PA 513 was designated in 1928 between US 13 in Cornwells Heights and PA 101 near South Langhorne. By 1947, PA 513 was rerouted to its current northern terminus, replacing a part of PA 113. Route description PA 513 northbound in Hulmeville PA 513 begins at an intersection with US 13 in the Cornwells Heights section of Bensalem Township, Bucks County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Hulmeville Road. The route passes through suburban residential areas, running to the east of Bensalem Township Country Club. The road crosses PA 132 in a commercial area, where it becomes a three- lane road with a center left-turn lane. PA 513 heads through areas of homes and businesses, passing to the west of Bensalem High School. The road comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 276) and continues through suburban development as a two-lane road. The route crosses the Neshaminy Creek into the borough of Hulmeville, where it turns north onto Bellevue Avenue at the Trenton Road intersection and passes through wooded areas of homes. The road continues north into the borough of Penndel and runs past more homes and businesses, reaching an intersection with US 1 Bus. (Lincoln Highway). A short distance later, PA 513 comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 413, at which point Bellevue Avenue continues north as PA 413. History By 1911, what is now PA 513 was a paved road between present-day US 13 and PA 132 while the remainder was unpaved. PA 513 was designated in 1928 to run from US 13 in Cornwells Heights north to PA 101 (Durham Road) near South Langhorne, following its present alignment to Hulmeville and continuing northeast on Trenton Road to PA 101.

He played for Cork Senior Championship club St. Finbarr's and was a member of the Cork senior hurling team for ten years, during which time he usually lined out as a left wing-back. Roche began his hurling career at club level with St. Finbarr's. He broke onto the club's top adult team as a 17-year-old in 1963 and enjoyed his first success two years later when the club won the 1965 Cork Championship, before claiming further titles in 1968, 1974 and 1977. The highlight of Roche's club career came in 1975 when he was at midfield on the All-Ireland Championship-winning team. At inter-county level, Roche was part of the successful Cork minor team that won the All- Ireland Championship in 1964 before later winning an All-Ireland Championship with the under-21 team in 1966. He joined the Cork senior team in 1965. From his debut, Roche was ever-present in the half-back line and made 23 Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1976. During that time he was part of two All-Ireland Championship-winning teams ‚Äì in 1966 as a substitute and 1970. Roche also secured four Munster Championship medals and four National Hurling League medals. He played his last game for Cork on 8 February 1976. Roche won his first All-Star in 1972, before claiming a further All-Star in 1974. At inter-provincial level, he was selected to play in four championship campaigns with Munster in the Railway Cup. After retiring as a player, Roche transitioned into coaching. He was involved as coach with three championship-winning team with St. Finbarr's. Roche later served as a Cork senior hurling team selector for their 1985 Munster Championship-winning success. He also had stints as coach with the Kerry and Cork senior hurling teams. Con is known to enjoy a few pints in the Cork area and is an associate of local singer Jim Creed and big Willie Cotter and Baby Barry. Playing career =Club= Roche played his club hurling with St. Finbarr's and enjoyed much success during a golden age for the club. He made his senior debut while still a minor in 1963 and immediately became a regular fixture on the team. After losing the championship decider to Glen Rovers in 1964, Roche was subsequently suspended for breach of \\"the ban\\" on the playing of foreign sports. \\"The Barr's\\" were back for a second successive final the following year. University College Cork provided the opposition, however, a youthful St. Finbarr's team powered to a 6‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì6 victory. It was Roche's first championship medal. A subsequent 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì3 trouncing of Waterford's Mount Sion gave him a Munster medal. After surrendering their titles the following year and losing the final to Glen Rovers in 1967, St. Finbarr's bounced back in 1968. Roche collected a second championship medal following a narrow 5‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì19 defeat of Imokilly. After an absence of six years, a period which also saw Roche being suspended for playing soccer, St. Finbarr's returned to the top table of Cork hurling once again. In spite of being regarded as underdogs against Blackrock, Roche gave a masterful display in helping the Barr's to a 2‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì14 victory. It was his third championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents in the subsequent provincial decider A low-scoring 0‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì3 victory gave Roche his second Munster medal, however, the game was tinged with sadness for St. Finbarr's as an horrific shine-bone injury brought Bernie Scully's career to an end. The All-Ireland final on St. Patrick's weekend saw St. Finbarr's take on the Fenians of Kilkenny. St. Finbarr's ability to get goals at crucial times proved to be the difference in the 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì6 victory. It was Roche's first All-Ireland medal. =Minor and under-21= Roche first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team and in 1964 enjoyed the ultimate success in that grade. A 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì9 defeat of Tipperary gave him a Munster. Cork later overwhelmed Laois in a unique All-Ireland decider. A remarkable 10‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì4 score line gave Cork the title and gave Roche an All-Ireland medal in what was his last game in that grade. By 1966 Roche was a key member of the Cork under-21 team. He won a Munster medal that year as Cork trounced Limerick by 5‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì6 in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final ended in a draw as Wexford recorded 5‚Äì6 to Cork's 3‚Äì12. The replay also ended all square ‚Äì 4‚Äì9 apiece. At the third time of asking Cork emerged victorious with a huge tally of 9‚Äì9 to 5‚Äì9. This victory gave Cork their first All-Ireland title in this grade and gave Roche an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. =Senior= Roche made his senior championship debut in a Munster quarter- final clash with Waterford in 1966. He also played in the semi-final defeat of Limerick, however, he was later dropped from the panel for Cork's subsequent Munster and All-Ireland victories. By 1969 Roche was back on the team. A 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave him his first National Hurling League medal. He later lined out with Cork in the championship, however, he was dropped once again for Cork's Munster victory and All-Ireland final defeat. Cork regrouped during the 1969‚Äì70 National League and Roche was back on the team once again. It was a successful campaign for the Rebels as an aggregate 5‚Äì21 to 6‚Äì16 defeat of New York gave him his second National Hurling League medal. The subsequent championship campaign saw Roche win his first [Munster medal as Tipperary were accounted for by 3‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì8. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition in the very first eighty-minute championship decider. The game saw a record 64-point score line for both teams as Cork's Eddie O'Brien scored a hat-trick of goals to give Cork a considerable lead. At the full-time whistle Cork were the winners by 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10, giving Roche an All-Ireland medal. After winning a third National League medal following a victory over Limerick in 1972, Roche later won a second Munster medal following a 6‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì8 thrashing of Clare. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Cork face Kilkenny. The Rebels dominated the early exchanges and went eight points clear after a long-range score from wing-back Roche in the 17th minute of the second half. Remarkably they didn't score again. Kilkenny took control with Pat Henderson a key figure at centre-back and Eddie Keher cutting loose up front. They were level after a Frank Cummins goal and went on to win by eight points. Roche finished off the year by collecting his first All-Star award. Two years later in 1974 Roche won a fourth National League medal as Cork defeated Limerick on a huge score line of 6‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì12. The following year Roche won his third Munster medal following a 3‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of reigning provincial champions Limerick. Cork were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final in what was Roche's last appearance for Cork. =Inter-provincial= Roche also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his debut with the province in 1971 and was a regular until his retirement in 1974. He enjoyed little success in this competition as Leinster dominated at the time. Coaching career =Kerry= In 1987 Roche took over as coach of the Kerry senior hurling team. A mid-table finish in Division 2 of the National League was followed by a 6‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì9 Munster quarter-final trouncing by Limerick. =Cork= Charlie McCarthy's departure as coach of the Cork senior hurling team in 1988 saw Roche cross the border from Kerry to take charge. After securing promotion from Division 2 of the National League to the top flight, Roche's side later fell to Waterford by 5‚Äì16 to 4‚Äì17 in a replay of the Munster semi-final.

A dual player at the highest levels, he played hurling and Gaelic football with his local club St. Finbarr's and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county teams in both codes from 1969 until 1977. Playing career =Schools Competitions= Harty Cup 1968 Colaiste Chriost Ri. =Minor & under-21= Looney first came to prominence as a dual player at minor level with Cork. He first tasted success with the Cork Gaelic footballers who won both Munster and All-Ireland honours in 1967. This feat was repeated in 1968 with Looney playing a key role on the full-back line as he captured another pair of provincial and All-Ireland medals. 1968 also saw Looney come to the fore with the county‚Äôs minor hurling team, as he won a Munster title but lost out on an All-Ireland medal. Looney subsequently moved on to the under-21 grades in both hurling and football. It was the beginning of a hugely successful period for the county. In 1969 Looney won his first set of Munster and All-Ireland under-21 hurling titles. He also captured a Munster under-21 football title for good measure. 1970 saw the success continue with Looney winning a second consecutive set of provincial and All-Ireland medals in hurling. That year he also added both Munster and All-Ireland under-21 football medals to his ever- growing collection of honours. In 1971 Looney completed a famous three-in-a- row with the under-21 hurlers when they captured the Munster and All-Ireland titles for a third successive year. Not to be outdone the Cork under-21 footballers also retained their Munster and All-Ireland honours, making it two-in-a-row. =Senior= By 1970 Looney was a key player on the Cork senior hurling team. He began that year by winning his first National Hurling League title, before later collecting his very first senior Munster title. Cork later beat Wexford in the first 80-minute championship decider, giving Looney his first All-Ireland medal. By 1971 Looney was also lining out for the county‚Äôs senior football team. He won a Munster title that year, however, the team was knocked out in the All-Ireland semi-final. 1972 saw Looney add a second National Hurling League medal to his collection, as well as a second Munster hurling title. Cork were later defeated by Kilkenny in a thrilling All-Ireland final.

Hegarty joined the team during the 1968-69 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1975 championship. During that time he won one All- Ireland medal, four Munster medals and four National League medals. Hegarty was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level Hegarty was a one-time intermediate championship medalist with Youghal. Playing career =Club= Hegarty played his club hurling with Youghal and enjoyed some success during a lengthy career. In 1969 he was a key member of the team that reached the final of the intermediate championship. Cobh provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Youghal's ability to score goals proved the deciding factor. A 3-9 to 0-13 win gave Hegarty an intermediate championship medal. =Inter-county= Hegarty first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork under-21 hurling tea in 1966. He made his debut as a substitute in a Munster semi-final defeat of Galway in 1966, however, he played no part in Cork's subsequent Munster and All-Ireland victories. Two years later Hegarty was captain of the under-21 team. He won a Munster medal that year following a 4-10 to 1-13 defeat of Tipperary. Cork later faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider and Hegarty was moved from centre-back to the half-forward line. A 2-18 to 3-9 victory gave Hegarty an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. Hegarty made his senior debut during the successful 1968-69 National League campaign for Cork. A 3-12 to 1-14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave him his first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial decider pitted Cork against reigning champions Tipperary. A 4-6 to 0-9 victory gave Cork a first defeat of Tipp since 1957 while it also gave Hegarty a first Munster medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland showdown with Kilkenny, however, the team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval and looked a good bet for the victory, particularly after Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. The Rebels were still to the good coming into the last quarter, however, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2-15 to 2-9. In spite of the All-Ireland defeat, Cork regrouped during the 1969-70 National League. It was a successful campaign for the Rebels as an aggregate 5-21 to 6-16 defeat of New York gave Hegarty his second National Hurling League medal. The subsequent championship campaign saw him win his third Munster medal as Tipperary were accounted for by 3-10 to 3-8. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition in the very first eighty-minute championship decider. The game saw a record 64-point score line for both teams as Cork's Eddie O'Brien scored a hat-trick of goals to give Cork a considerable lead. At the full-time whistle Cork were the winners by 6-21 to 5-10, giving Hegarty his first All-Ireland medal. After collecting a third National League medal following a victory over Limerick in 1972, Hegarty later won a third Munster medal following a 6-18 to 2-8 thrashing of Clare. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Cork face Kilkenny. The Rebels dominated the early exchanges and went eight points clear after a long-range score from wing-back Con Roche in the 17th minute of the second half. Remarkably they didn‚Äôt score again. Kilkenny took control with Pat Henderson a key figure at centre-back and Eddie Keher cutting loose up front. They were level after a Frank Cummins goal and went on to win by eight points.

Cork were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. =Inter-provincial= Hegarty also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter- provincial series of games.

He was a member of the Minor Council (minor consiglio), an assembly formed from members of the so-called \\"apostolic families\\" that, in oligarchical Venice, assumed the governmental functions of judges, military councilmen, ambassadors and heads of state. His first name, which is otherwise unknown in Venetian history, is thought to have been derived from a backwards spelling of the Venetian name \\"Faledro\\", or from the Ordelaffi family, of which the Faliero family is thought to be a stirpe. During his reign as Doge, Faliero went to war against the Hungarians, ruled at the time by Coloman, which lasted from 1105 to 1115. Faliero succeeded in recapturing Zara and Sebenico. Afterwards, Faliero was engaged in an expedition to Syria, comprising 100 Venetian ships, which succeeded in conquering a part of Acre. Objects from the local Syrian convent of Christ Pantocrator were taken back to Saint Mark's Basilica. In Venice, Faliero established the nucleus of what would become the Arsenal.

Cullinane joined the team during the 1968-69 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1970 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one National League medal. Cullinane was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At club level Cullinane was a one-time All-Ireland medalist with St. Finbarr's. In addition to this he has also won two Munster medals and three county club championship medals. Playing career =Club= Cullinane played his club hurling with St. Finbarr's and enjoyed much success during a golden age for the club. After losing the championship decider to Glen Rovers in 1964, \\"the Barr's\\" were back for a second successive final the following year. University College Cork provided the opposition, however, a youthful St. Finbarr's team powered to a 6-8 to 2-6 victory. It was Cullinane's first championship medal. A subsequent 3-12 to 2-3 trouncing of Waterford's Mount Sion gave him a Munster medal. After surrendering their titles the following year and losing the final to Glen Rovers in 1967, St. Finbarr's bounced back in 1968. Cullinane collected a second championship medal following a narrow 5-9 to 1-19 defeat of Imokilly. After an absence of six years St. Finbarr's returned to the top table of Cork hurling once again. In spite of being regarded as underdogs against Blackrock, Con Roche gave a masterful display in helping the Barr's to a 2-17 to 2-14 victory. It was Cullinane's third championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents in the subsequent provincial decider A low-scoring 0-7 to 0-3 victory gave Cullinane his second Munster medal, however, the game was tinged with sadness for St. Finbarr's as an horrific shine-bone injury brought Bernie Scully's career to an end. The All-Ireland final on St. Patrick‚Äôs weekend saw St. Finbarr‚Äôs take on the Fenians of Kilkenny. St. Finbarr‚Äôs ability to get goals at crucial times proved to be the difference in the 3-8 to 1-6 victory. It was Cullinane‚Äôs sole All-Ireland medal. =Inter-county= Cullinane made his senior debut for Cork during their successful 1968-69 National Hurling League campaign. A 3-12 to 1-14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave Cullinane his first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial decider pitted Cork against reigning champions Tipperary. A 4-6 to 0-9 victory gave Cork a first defeat of Tipp since 1957 while it also gave Cullinane a first Munster medal. Once again this victory paved the way for an All-Ireland showdown with Kilkenny, however, the team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval and looked a good bet for the victory, particularly after Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. The Rebels were still to the good coming into the last quarter, however, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2-15 to 2-9. In spite of the All-Ireland defeat, Cork regrouped the following year. The championship campaign saw Cullinane win his second Munster medal as Tipperary were accounted for by 3-10 to 3-8.

Temco's failure to secure a United States Air Force order for the Buckaroo forced it to turn to non-U.S. governments to keep the production lines going, yet only a few export orders materialized. Design and development Early in 1948, Temco's president, Robert McCulloch, received an inquiry from the Philippine Government expressing an interest in a tandem trainer version of the Swift. The first TE-1A was a modification of the Swift GC-1B, hand-built to rough layout drawings, the major difference in appearance being the tandem seating arrangement which resulted in a narrow windshield and an elongated two-piece canopy with a fixed bubble at the rear. This TE-1A prototype was completed late in 1948. After initial flight tests a 145-hp Continental engine replaced the original 125-hp installation. Early in 1949, Temco's management received word that the United States Air Force (USAF) planned to hold a competition for a new primary/basic trainer. Temco built two additional prototypes for this competition, adding some minor improvements as time permitted. The three aircraft were designated the YT-35 by the Air Force. Temco was competing with two other training aircraft, namely the Fairchild XNQ-1/T-31 and the Beechcraft Model 45. On 24 February 1949, the Air Force trainer evaluation board chose the Beech Model 45 by a four-to-one vote with Temco's TE-1A a distant third. Due to budget cuts, the USAF program was ultimately cancelled that year. Although the USAF had decided against the TE-1A, interest had increased on the part of foreign governments, particularly the Republic of the Philippines. After a study of the competition evaluation, Temco decided to proceed with a program to improve the TE-1A. Some of the redesign included: # A three-inch increase in the overall length of fuselage and a change in its cross section to be more compatible with the tandem seating. # The horizontal tail was raised nine inches. # Wing and fuselage fillets were added. # Improved landing gear with main gear relocation to improve ground handling characteristics. # Structural improvement in the wing to meet 9 G loading. # Equipment and equipment installation changes were made including a change from a 12-volt to a 24-volt electrical system and radio installation changes to meet Air Force standards. Concurrent with all this redesign, Temco had decided to build, on speculation, 10 of these production models powered by 145-hp engines. Operational history Late in 1949 with the engineering and tooling about 75% complete, three of the TE-1As redesigned YT-35 were entered in the revived USAF trainer competition commencing in 1950.Dorr 1991, p. 835. An evaluation program using students flying competing aircraft would be held at Randolph Air Force Base. Following receipt of the USAF order, Temco decided that in addition to the extensive changes that had been made to the TE-1A, a 165-hp Franklin engine would be installed. The USAF agreed to the change, with this model designated the TE-1B and given the name ‚ÄúBuckaroo‚Äù. Development of the TE-1A and the TE-1B continued concurrently. The TE-1A was designated for export, and the TE-1B was for the USAF. One TE-1A was bought by the Israeli Air Force and a second one was bought by the Greek Air Force. In July 1950, the three YT-35 Buckaroos were delivered to Randolph AFB to compete with the YT-34 Mentor, the Fairchild T-31, Boulton Paul Balliol, and the de Havilland DHC-1B Chipmunk trainers. Later in 1950, the Korean War disrupted many U.S. military programs, including the YT-35 evaluation. The aircraft ended up at James Connally Air Force Base, now called TSTC Waco Airport near Waco, Texas. 1950 Temco T-35A, N904B (Manufacturer's Serial number: 6005) is privately owned. After 10 months of rigorous testing, the three YT-35s were returned to Temco in late July 1951, for factory overhaul. They then were assigned to Goodfellow Air Force Base where later all three were sold as surplus. The majority of the TE-1Bs were sold to Saudi Arabia (designated T-35A) through the USAF under the Mutual Defense Aid Program. Temco's contract with the Saudis called for ten T-35A aircraft and enough spares to keep them flying for years. The Saudi Arabian T-35A aircraft included two 30-caliber machine guns, one mounted inside each wing and ten 2.75-inch rockets, five mounted under each wing. Both Italy and Israel bought a single TE-1B Buckaroo in 1948. In 1950, the Israeli aircraft was evaluated against the Fokker Instructor and the DHC-1 Chipmunk for possible use as a trainer with the IAF flight school. Losing the competition, the single Buckaroo was retired in late 1950 or early 1951.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim, whose seat is in the municipality of R√ºdesheim an der Nahe. Boos is a winegrowing village. Nahe; the Nahe Valley Railway skirts the village Geography =Location= Boos lies between the Hunsr√ºck and the North Palatine Uplands on the river Nahe, southeast of Bad Sobernheim. Its elevation is 135 m above sea level and the municipal area measures 1.11 km¬≤. =Neighbouring municipalities= Clockwise from the north, Boos's neighbours are the municipality of Waldb√∂ckelheim, the municipality of Duchroth, the municipality of Staudernheim and the municipality of Oberstreit. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Boos is the outlying homestead of Im K√§sberg.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 16 (PDF; 2,3 MB) History The village of Boos arose on a flood-free point bar on the Nahe on a low terrace north of that river on a brook. As already witnessed by many archaeological finds from the New Stone Age, the Bronze Age, Celtic times and Roman times, Boos is one of the oldest populated centres in the Nahe region. The greater and more important finds from bygone ages are those from Roman times. Generally known is the Roman villa rustica with its preserved cryptoporticus level. It is a lordly house with two vaulted cellars from the 2nd or 3rd century AD, which since 1990 has been preserved and made accessible to the public. In 1128, Boos had its first documentary mention when one of Disibodenberg Abbey's landholds was confirmed. This estate also included a holding in Boos that Kuno von B√∂ckelheim and his wife, who had been Archbishop of Mainz Willigis‚Äôs (995‚Äì1011) regents, had donated to their young charge in 976. On this basis, Boos celebrated its one thousandth anniversary (‚Äú1000 Jahre Boos‚Äù) in 1976. In the Middle Ages, the Vogtei rights had belonged to the Counts (later Dukes) of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, who had in turn inherited them from the Counts of Veldenz. In the 18th century, however, these rights were held jointly by Electoral Palatinate and the Lords of Stein-Kallenfels. Beginning in 1798, Boos belonged to the administrative unit of Sobernheim, which in 1815 passed to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815, within which it was grouped into the new Bad Kreuznach district the following year. In 1888, Boos passed in the course of administrative reform to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Waldb√∂ckelheim. Since a further administrative reform in 1970, Boos has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of R√ºdesheim.History =Municipality‚Äôs name= The name ‚ÄúBoos‚Äù, according to a mention from about the year 1000, can be explained as a reference to bushland. In this mention, the village is called Boys. Under Archbishop of Mainz Willigis (995‚Äì1011), Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia from the noble house of the Salians donated to Disibodenberg Abbey an estate of 20 Morgen of Salian land and two occupied Huben (roughly ‚Äúoxgangs‚Äù) for his late daughter Udo's salvation. On the other hand, Boos's own website suggests another derivation, from the archaic word bozen, which meant ‚Äúhit‚Äù or ‚Äústrike‚Äù. The basis for believing this is that on the slopes northwest of the village were once found many sandstone quarries, where of course stone was struck with hammers or pickaxes.Municipality‚Äôs name Religion As at 31 August 2013, there are 372 full-time residents in Boos, and of those, 232 are Evangelical (62.366%), 74 are Catholic (19.892%), 1 is Lutheran (0.269%), 4 (1.075%) belong to other religious groups and 61 (16.398%) either have no religion or will not reveal their religious affiliation.Religion Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Boos's mayor is Karl-Heinz Klein, and his deputies are Berthold Schick and Eckhard Hoseus.Boos‚Äôs mayorBoos‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Gules the Apostle James holding in his dexter hand a pilgrim's staff and in his sinister hand an escallop, all Or.Coat of arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Bad Kreuznach district * Evangelical church, Kirchstra√üe 1 ‚Äì Gothic aisleless church, west tower essentially Romanesque, latter half of the 11th or earlier half of the 12th century, on Roman building remnants; nave made over in Baroque 1706‚Äì1712 * Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì remnants of a villa rustica, 1st to 5th century AD, two cryptoportici, two vaulted cellars * Hauptstra√üe 20 ‚Äì town hall, Baroque timber-frame building with open ground floor hall, 18th century * Kellereistra√üe 1 ‚Äì barrel-vaulted cellar with segmental-arch stairway, marked 1598, window above =More about buildings= One of the most striking buildings in Boos is the old town hall (Rathaus) in the middle of the village, formerly called the Backes (a corruption of the German word Backhaus, meaning ‚Äúbakehouse‚Äù). After it was sold to the Evangelical Church in 1960, the Backes passed back to the municipality through a sale agreement in 2006. After a thorough restoration and the reconstruction (or new construction) of the Backes in 2009 and 2010, the Boos town hall took on a new shine and afforded the local people the opportunity to revive the traditional communal baking at the old bakehouse's oven. The unpaid work, especially, done by many citizens ‚Äì foremost among them R√ºdiger Franzmann, Berthold Schick, Horst and Karl Weyrich ‚Äì but also contributions made by the state within the framework of village renewal, made it possible to create this gem on the village's Denkmalinsel (‚Äúmonumental island‚Äù, although it is not geographically an island). The historic town hall is currently used for things such as seniors‚Äô coffeehouses, an alternative venue for council meetings, events like Tag des Denkmals (‚ÄúDay of the Monument‚Äù), Advent celebration and other things, too. The building can also be hired for private purposes. Also in the village are the remnants of a Roman villa rustica, built by Romans who settled on the Nahe in the time of the Roman Empire. Visitors can see here how a Roman hypocaust worked. Not far from Boos, between Staudernheim and Odernheim, is the Disibodenberg, upon which the Irish monk Disibod founded a monastery. Hildegard of Bingen lived and worked there for more than 40 years. =Clubs= The following clubs are active in Boos:Clubs *Angel- und Naturschutzverein Boos ‚Äî angling and conservation club *Booser Carneval-Verein ‚Äî Shrovetide Carnival (Fastnacht) club *Booser Frauentreff ‚Äî women's club *Feuerwehrf√∂rderverein ‚Äî fire brigade promotional association *F√∂rderverein Booser Denkmalinsel e.V. ‚Äî Denkmalinsel (‚Äúmonumental island‚Äù) promotional association *Freiwillige Feuerwehr Boos ‚Äî volunteer fire brigade *TUS Boos 1926 e.V. ‚Äî gymnastic and sport club *Volksbildungswerk ‚Äî ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs education‚Äù =Public institutions= Among public facilities available in Boos are the municipal hall, the sport hall and the sporting ground. =Education= There are no schools in Boos itself, but the following schools are available to learners from the village in nearby places:Education *Geschwister-Scholl-Schule (primary school and Regionalschule, Waldb√∂ckelheim, named after Hans and Sophie Scholl, members of a non-violent anti-Nazi resistance cell called White Rose) *Emanuel-Felke- Gymnasium Bad Sobernheim *Hauptschule Bad Sobernheim *Realschule Bad Sobernheim *Evangelischer Kindergarten ‚ÄöUnterm Regenbogen‚Äô (‚Äú‚ÄòUnder the Rainbow‚Äô Evangelical Kindergarten‚Äù, Waldb√∂ckelheim) *Katholischer Kindergarten (‚ÄúCatholic Kindergarten‚Äù, daycare centre, Waldb√∂ckelheim) Famous people =Sons and daughters of the town= * Reinhold Petermann (b. 1925), printer, sculptor and restorer References External links * Boos in the collective municipality‚Äôs webpages * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Bad Kreuznach (district) Category:Rhine Province ","title":"Boos, Bad Kreuznach"},{"id":"11853712","text":"Louise Taper is a historian and collector of Abraham Lincoln artifacts.

It is the one of two coasters in the park, along with the small classic wooden Rollo Coaster, and its only steel roller coaster. The Wild Mouse was originally designed for Wiener Prater in Vienna, Austria where it operated as Speedy Gonzalez from 1985-1987. Built by Vekoma, it is thus far the only wild mouse coaster designed by this corporation. It was later moved to Alton Towers, an amusement park in Staffordshire, England. When it opened there in 1987, its name was the Alton Mouse. The ride featured a covered lift hill there, which was used to conceal the treacherous curves at the top of the hill from patrons until they reached the top. The lift hill was also tilted, which suggests that the cover was a rotating tunnel, which with the tilting track, created the effect of going upside-down. The Alton Mouse was closed in 1992, partly because the harsh curve and braking system had diminished its popularity, but mainly because the area of the park it was located in was small and the ride was popular, causing congestion. Local residents also complained of the noise levels, so when the Alton Mouse was removed, so were the other rides in the area, which was closed off from the rest of the park. In 1993, the Wild Mouse reopened at Idlewild. The track was originally painted a rust red with black supports when the ride first moved to Idlewild. Rough air brakes continued to hinder the ride until 2002, when a new, much smoother magnetic braking system was installed by Pribonics Technologies and the color scheme was changed to gray track, still with black supports. The Wild Mouse features a traditional setup, including tight, unbanked curves and short but steep hills. However, the ride's height is somewhat taller than that of the average wild mouse coaster and includes a somewhat rougher ride. The ride did not operate during the 2012 season and the first half of the 2013 season. In early July this ride was seen testing. On July 14 this ride was opened to the public. Trivia Wild Mouse is the only \\"Mouse\\" coaster ever built by Vekoma.

The species varies in colour from dark blue to brown or pale grey, and may grow to in carapace width and weigh over . A group of blue land crabs Description The carapace of C. guanhumi can reach a width up to . As with many crab species, males possess dimorphic claws: the larger claw can grow up to around in length, eventually becoming larger than the carapace itself. The eyes are stalked and their colour ranges from a deep blue to a pale grey. Juveniles generally have a brown carapace with orange coloured legs. Females usually appear light gray or white. Adult colours are usually present between and . Individuals of the species can weigh over . Distribution Cardisoma guanhumi is found throughout estuarine and other coastal regions of the Caribbean, and along the Atlantic coast of Central and South America (south to Brazil). In the United States it can be found in coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Florida north to Vero Beach. Relatively cold water temperatures in the winter, less than , affect the larval survival and restricts the species' possibility of spreading further north. Diet In Everglades. Video clip Cardisoma guanhumi is omnivorous, collecting and eating leaves and fruits close to its burrow whilst also eating insects and carrion. Like many crabs, this species is cannibalistic. They move in the shade during the day and will eschew moving in prolonged direct sunlight to feed at night instead. According to a fisherman who's been catching them for 50 years, once captured, the smaller ones take two weeks to filter (clean) before they are consumable and the larger ones take a month.http://esnoticiapr.com/medio-siglo-en-la-pesca-de-jueyes/ Senses Cardisoma guanhumi finds its food using light and sound detectors. Experiments show that crabs can be drawn out of their burrows to investigate the sound of falling fruit, once out they initiate a search for food. Predatory behavior is released in these crabs by detection of small moving objects. Crabs in the genus Cardisoma are able to detect small vibrations on the ground within the range of 10‚Äì1500 Hz and 70 dB. Visual acuity increases with body size due to an increase in both the number and diameter of ommatidia. Life cycle Guarding the burrow A juvenile blue land crab showing a different coloring The reproductive cycle is closely linked to seasonal weather patterns and lunar phase. Heavy rains in the spring initiate migrations. When this occurs, C. guanhumi begins to gain weight, as more food is consumed and gathered for the first few weeks of the migratory period. Males mate with mature females during this time. Fertilization is internal, and throughout July and August most females carry the eggs externally. After approximately 2 weeks the eggs will hatch and must be released into saltwater for the larvae to survive. Several spawns per year may occur with spawning season varying with location within the range. In Florida, spawning season lasts from June to December and reaches its peak in October and November. In the Bahamas the season extends from July to September, while in Venezuela spawning lasts from July to November. Eggs hatch into free swimming larvae with 5 zoeal stages and 1 postlarval or megalopa stage. Typical development time from hatching to the first crabs stage is 42 days under laboratory conditions; however, this time may be much shorter in wild specimens. C. guanhumi is a slow-growing species compared to most other crabs. It requires more than 60 molts ‚Äì roughly three times more than other species of crab ‚Äì to reach its full size. The crab will generally seal the exit to its burrow using mud, 6‚Äì10 days before it molts, in order to protect itself from predators. (After molting, crabs are more vulnerable to attack as their shell has not yet hardened.)
