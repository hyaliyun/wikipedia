It is located at Main and Maple Streets. History The library was founded in 1859 by a committee of leading citizens, initially renting space near the intersection of Main Street and Montvale Avenue. In two years the library had accumulated nearly 1,500 volumes, most donated by older private library groups. As the library expanded its holdings over the following decades, it relocated several times to ever-larger spaces. By 1878 the collection had grown to over 5,000 volumes. In 1903 the town was awarded a grant of $15,000 by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for the construction of a permanent library building. This resulted in the 1904 construction of the modest Classical Revival building that forms the heart of the library complex at Maple and Main Streets. As originally built, this was a single story building made of Roman brick, and capped by a hip roof. Its main entrance was slightly recessed in a square archway flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature. In 1931 this building was extended from three to five bays, and a cupola was added. The building was again enlarged in 1983, using the same building materials and retaining single story layout, but with modern styling. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and was included as a contributing property to the Central Square Historic District in 1990. The library's services, in addition to its circulating book collection, include access to online databases. The library is a member of the North of Boston Library Exchange (NOBLE), through which cardholders can access resources of other libraries in the region.

Although it is not an official document, it was written by someone apparently associated with the royal administration. It lists and explains the laws, and includes explanations of how to conduct legal proceedings. Although its title implies that these laws were issued by King Henry, it lists laws issued by earlier monarchs that were still in force in Henry's reign; the only law of Henry that is included is the coronation charter he issued at the start of his reign. It covers a diverse range of subjects, including ecclesiastical cases, treason, murder, theft, feuds, assessment of danegeld, and the amounts of judicial fines. The work survives in six manuscripts that range in date from about 1200 to around 1330, belonging to two different manuscript traditions. Besides the six surviving manuscripts, three others were known to scholars in the 17th and 18th centuries, but have not survived to the present day. Two other separate copies may also have existed. The complete work itself was first printed in 1644, but an earlier partial edition appeared in 1628. The Leges is the first legal treatise in English history, and has been credited with having the greatest effect on the views of English law before the reign of King Henry II than any other work of its kind. Background and similar works The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I is not merely a compilation of laws but an integrated legal treatise, the first such in the history of England, written in the Latin language about 1115. It records the legal customs of medieval England.Huscroft Ruling England p. 38Huscroft Ruling England pp. 113–114 It was part of a small group of similar writings devoted to legal procedures that were written for royal administrators. Besides the Leges, other works of this type produced at this time were the Quadripartitus, parts of the Leges Edwardi Regis, the Instituta Cnuti, and the Consiliatio Cnuti. It is possible the Leges Willhelmi was also written during this time period.Warren Governance p. 72 It is the longest of the legal tracts from its time, and made some effort to be comprehensive. Sources The provisions set forth in the Leges can be traced to laws of Cnut and various Anglo-Saxon codes.Hollister Henry I p. 112 Some of the Anglo-Saxon codes used may have been subsequently lost. Also, certain legal terms used in the Leges, whether in their original English language or rendered into Latin, cannot be found in any extant legal code, and may be another example of preserving now-lost legal codes or provisions.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 28–30 It also draws upon non-English sources, including Isidore of Seville and Ivo of Chartres, as well as legal codes such as Frankish and canon law.Wormald Making of English Law p. 413 Other sources include the Vulgate edition of the Bible and Roman law codes, although the debt to those sources is small.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 31–34 Authorship and title The Leges was written between 1114 and 1118 by an unknown Norman, who is very likely to be the author of another legal work, the Quadripartitus, although some historians, including H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, argue that the two works were by different authors.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 27–28 The Leges was probably part of a project including the Quadripartitus, the two works being part of a planned work in four volumes to cover not only the laws of the writer's own time, but previous laws of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, as well as how to handle legal cases. As part of both works, the author has included the Charter of Liberties,Green Government of England p. 106 which was King Henry's coronation charter promising not to follow the administrative and legal policies of his predecessor, King William II.Huscroft Ruling England p. 68 About a third of the material in the Leges is also in the Quadripartitus.Wormald Making of English Law p. 465 There is evidence that the author of the two works had been a member of the household of Gerard, who had been chancellor under Kings William I and William II before becoming Archbishop of York under Henry I.Green Government of England p. 162 The work was likely composed at Winchester.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 44–45 Usually the work has been known as the Leges Henrici Primi, or Laws of Henry the First. It gained that name from the inscription \\"De libertate ecclesie et totius Anglie obseruanda leges Henrici primi\\" which occurs on five of the six extant manuscripts. The sixth manuscript adds \\"filii conquestoris\\" at the end of the inscription.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 7–8 The historian Felix Libermann called the work Leges Henrici, but the fuller title of Leges Henrici Primi is generally used to help differentiate which Henry is being referred to. Contents The work is not a law code issued by King Henry, but a compilation of already extant legislation that was still current during his reign. It is not a comprehensive listing of all laws that were in force during the early 11th century. It begins with Henry's Charter of Liberties, which he issued after his coronation, and this is the only actual legal document reproduced in the Leges. Some discussions of juridical matters then follow, then a long treatment of ecclesiastical issues. The rest of the treatise is concerned with non-ecclesiastical subjects, including cases of injury, theft, murder, and feuds. Procedural topics are included, such as how summonses to court should be formed, what notices need to be made before judicial procedures, how adjournments should be handled, and other such concerns. There is no strong organizational framework to the entirety of the Leges, which leads the author to repeat subjects as well as treating some subjects less than adequately.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 2–5 The law code recognised the difference between the laws of the Danelaw, the old Kingdom of Mercia, and the lands of the Kingdom of Wessex. It also set out a list of legal proceedings that could only be tried before the king or his officials, the cases of which were known as \\"royal pleas\\" or \\"pleas of the crown\\"; they included serious crimes such as treason, murder, rape, robbery, arson, and some types of theft. Treasure trove and salvage from wrecks were also matters of interest to the crown. Other royal cases involved counterfeiters or false judgement, or violent acts against the king himself or his household and servants.Green Government of England p. 102 The king also reserved the right to hear appeals from other courts conducted by local authorities or by his nobles. The tract also set out who should attend the shire court, ruling that the local bishop and earl, as well as the sheriff and local barons, among others, should attend. The work assumes that the royal legal system would still address some issues that later would have been dealt with by ecclesiastical courts. Clergy are not only to take part in the shire court, but could be summoned to answer charges in the court.Green Government of England p. 9 It also sets out the various courts that were established and their jurisdiction. It takes for granted that the Anglo-Saxon laws of England are still in effect.Green Government of England pp. 99–100 It also addresses the administration of forest law under Henry I.Green Government of England pp. 126–127 Another new concern in the Leges is law covering the roadways and highways.Wormald Making of English Law p. 466 Another area covered by the work is royal finance, with the Leges setting out the rate of Danegeld, at a rate of one shilling per hide.Green Government of England p. 74 It also covers judicial fines, setting forth a fine of 46 marks as the penalty for committing murder.Green Government of England pp. 80–81 The author of the work criticised the royal justices, calling them greedy.Green Government of England p. 117 It sets out elaborate procedures for the conduct of murder cases, or murdum.Warren Governance pp. 60–61 The Leges also devoted some effort to the theory of the law, and attempted to make generalisations about legal procedures and practices. It also contains a number of dicta which became cliches, such as \\"who unknowingly offends will knowingly amend\\" and \\"witness is not needed as to what did not occur, but as to what an accused claims did occur\\".Wormald Making of English Law p. 467 Manuscripts The work comes down to the present day in two manuscript traditions, neither one of which contains many manuscripts.Wormald Making of English Law p. 412 There are six surviving manuscripts between the two traditions – that of the manuscript Sc and its copies, and the \\"London group\\". The Sc group is composed of the Sc manuscript itself, which probably dates from about 1225, and its copy, Hg, which was written about 1250. Sc is currently part of the Red Book of the Exchequer held by the Public Record Office. Hg is held by the British Library and is catalogued as Hargrave 313.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 46–47 It consists of folios 5 through 14a of the manuscript.British Library \\"Full Description of Hargrave 313\\" British Library Manuscripts Catalogue Four other extant manuscripts belong to the \\"London\\" tradition, and three other now-lost manuscripts are also known to have belonged to this grouping. The surviving manuscripts are known as K, Co, Or, and Rs. The three lost manuscripts have been assigned the names of Gi, Sl, and Tw. K is a manuscript currently in the British Library, and was part of the Cotton Library before becoming part of the British Museum then the British Library. Given the catalogue name of Cotton Claudius D II, it is the only illuminated manuscript of the Leges and dates to around 1310. Co is currently in the Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Library and was part of the Parker Library in the 16th century before being bequeathed to Corpus Christi on Parker's death. This manuscript dates to around 1320 and is catalogued as Corpus Christi College 70.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 48–50 The Leges occupies folios 108 through 170.Parker Library \\"Description of CCC 70\\" Parker Library on the Web The manuscript Or was originally part of the Oriel College, Oxford Library but is now part of the Bodleian Library. It dates from around 1330 and is catalogued as Oriel College 46. The last extant manuscript is Rs, which is currently in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. It was written about 1201 and is catalogued as Rylands lat.155. The three known but now-lost manuscripts included Gi, which was known in 1721 and was owned by the London Guildhall. It was used by David Wilkins to compile his 1721 work Leges Anglo-Saxonicae as well by Henry Spelman to correct manuscripts used in the Epistola Eleutherii. The Sl manuscript belonged to John Selden in the 17th century, but it is unclear when it was created. It was used by Roger Twysden in his edition of the Leges Henrici Primi. The last securely known lost manuscript is the Tw manuscript, and was used by Twysden in his edition of the Leges, and was perhaps owned by him also. Possibly two other manuscripts existed but little is known about them. One is often designated Sp, and was used by Spelman for his 1625 Glossarium Archaiollogicum, for which he used three manuscripts of the Leges – Sc, K and one that he does not name but has subsequently been designated as Sp. It appears to have belonged to the London grouping, and may have been Gi rather than a separate manuscript, although Spelman's description and usage is unclear as to which possibility is most likely. The other possible manuscript was one that Wilkins referred to as \\"quod iudetur fuisse Archiepiscopi aut Monachorum Cantuar\\", but it has not been found in searches of Lambeth Palace Library or the various Canterbury repositories.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 50–51 Besides the medieval manuscripts, there are three early modern transcriptions of the work – one from the 16th century now at the Cambridge University Library as manuscript Dd.VI 38, the second at Trinity College, Cambridge from the 17th century, catlogued as Cambridge O.10,20, and the last in the British Library as Harley 785, also dating from the 17th century. Publishing history The first complete printed edition of the Leges was in 1644, as an appendix to a new edition of the Arcaionomia prepared by Abraham Wheelock. The actual text of the Leges was edited by Twysden. Prior to this, two other scholars, William Lambarde and Spelman, had intended to produce printed editions of the Leges, but were unable to follow through on the project. A portion of the Leges had earlier appeared in Edward Coke's Institutes of the Laws of England in 1628. Another edition appeared in 1721, with Wilkins' publication of the Leges Anglo-Saxonicae, which built on the work of William Somner between 1645 and 1652. In 1776, David Hoüard reprinted Wilkins' text of the Leges in the Traites sur les coutumes anglo-normandes, and in 1789 another reproduction of Wilkins' text appeared in Paulus Canciani's Barbarorum Legs Antiquae.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 73–77 What is considered the first scholarly discussion of the Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along with a discussion of the sources of the work and a description of the work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had been edited by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J. Downer,Downer (ed.) Leges Henrici Primi and includes updated commentary and manuscript information.Downer \\"Introduction\\" Leges Henrici Primi pp. 1–79 Legacy and influence The work is an important historical source for the study of the Middle Ages. An edition was published along with other 12th- century legal treatises, in the Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen, and more recently it has been studied by the historian L. J.

As of 2014, SGV & Company has employed over 3,000 professionals from various disciplines, including Certified Public Accountants, legal professionals, economists, human resource professionals, engineers, statisticians, financial analysts, and other business and technical experts. Since 1996, it has been the only ISO 9002-certified professional services firm in the country and became a member firm of Ernst & Young International on June 6, 2002. History Early years SyCip, Gorres, Velayo, and Company was founded in 1946 by Washington SyCip in Manila, providing services to businesses recovering from the Second World War. SyCip's childhood friend, Alfredo M. Velayo, and Vicente O. José, an accountant with experience in tax work, were taken in as partners in 1947 to form SyCip, Velayo, José & Company. The firm managed their first overseas assignment the following year. Growth The firm embarked on its first overseas engagement by working out a merger with Henry Hunter Bayne & Co. (HHB), which started its practice in the then-American controlled Philippine Islands in 1906. In 1953, Thomas Farnell, a senior partner of HHB, decided to return to the United States and sell his firm to Filipino accountants Arsenio Reyes and Ramón J. Gorres. After a series of negotiations between the two and SyCip, the firms merged to form SyCip, Gorres, Velayo & Company. In 1958, SGV & Company assumed the practice of British firm Fleming & Williamson, which was rated the second-largest accounting firm in the Philippines, and expanded further by establishing offices in Bacolod and Davao. In the 1960s, the SGV Group was established and it began correspondent relations with some of the leading western firms, among them Arthur Andersen & Co.; Ernst & Ernst; Haskins & Sells; and Ernst & Young. SGV partnered with Taiwanese public accounting firm, T.N. Soong & Co in 1964 through a technical cooperation agreement amidst the economic boom in Taiwan. In the 1970s the SGV Group gained accreditation from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In 1985, SGV & Company became a member firm of Arthur Andersen & Co., S.C., one of the largest professional service organisations in the world. A year later, the firm opened its Manila Offshore Systems Development Center, with assistance from Andersen Consulting, and has provided computer software services to foreign clients through Andersen Consulting's global marketing network and resources. Secession In 1988 senior partner Benjamin Punongbayan left SGV with banker José Araullo to form Punongbayan & Araullo. Mario Mananghaya, another SGV partner, went on to establish former KPMG member, Laya Mananghaya & Company, later sold to a consortium owned by former SGV chairman Cesar Purisima in 2007, having grown the firm to the second or third biggest accounting firm in the country.  Victorias Milling Corporation  In 2000, the country's local accountant's professional body reprimanded SGV, then an Andersen affiliate in the Philippines, in relation to its audit with Victorias Milling Company. SGV withdrew audit reports worth three years after it was found out that it certified them without checking, which were later determined to be fraudulent. Ernst & Young affiliation SGV distanced itself with Arthur Andersen in 2002, after it was involved in the Enron scandal. SGV & Company became a member practice of Ernst & Young on September 1, 2002. Previously the Ernest & Young affiliate in the country was Punongbayan & Araullo. SGV 14 In 2008, a group dubbed as the SGV 14 led by then Vice Chairman Roman Felipe Reyes disputed the integration of SGV's local operations with Ernst & Young's international operation arguing the move was against the constitution since the local accounting industry is restricted to Filipinos. Reyes' group with Chairman David Balangue ousted by Cirilo Noel who became chairman in 2009. The SGV 14 settled for a \\"withdrawal package\\" agreement which include a non-compete clause baring them from working with SGV's competitors for several years. Reyes and 11 others of the group later established Reyes Tacandong & Co. which became an affiliate of RSM International. 2010s As of 2010, SGV is headquartered in Makati, about ten branches across the Philippines. As of December 2016, SGV & Company remains the biggest accounting firm in the Philippines, auditing about half of 304 publicly listed companies in the Philippine Stock Exchange. SGV has been receiving stiff competition from rival firms, KPMG R.G. Manabat & Co., Reyes Tacandong & Co., Isla Lipana & Co., and Navarro Amper & Co. all established by former partners of the SGV.

Description and setting The Stoneham Firestation is prominently located adjacent to Central Square at the heart of the town's central business district. It is an L-shaped brick and masonry structure, two stories in height, with a flat roof that is obscured from view by a low parapet. The building is Mediterranean in style, primarily because of the four-story Tuscan tower that towers over it. There are narrow windows in the tower at the third level, above which is an elaborately decorated cornice. The fourth stage is open, with arched openings on each side and square piers at the corners. This is topped by a shallow-pitch tile roof with an dentillated cornice. The station was built in 1916, and continues to serve as the town's central fire station. It has three equipment bays at the front, with office space in the rear portion of the ell. The tower was a common feature of early 20th-century fire stations, which required space for hoses to dry.

A dental student, Kavanaugh was awarded the Albert Medal following his rescue of a youth during a shark attack at Bondi Beach in January 1929. With the establishment of the George Cross, the Albert Medal was discontinued and, in 1971, living recipients of the decoration were invited to exchange their medal for the George Cross; Kavanaugh took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the George Cross. Early life and education Kavanaugh was born in Wingham, New South Wales, on 18 December 1906 to Herbert Leo Kavanaugh, a dentist, and his wife Alice Rose (née Flood). In 1917, the family moved to Sydney where Kavanaugh was educated at Waverley and Burwood public schools, as well as by a private tutor. He was active in sport, playing Rugby Union for the Eastern Suburbs District Football Club, and belonging to the Sydney Rowing Club and the Kensington Amateur Athletic Association. Aged fifteen, Kavanaugh undertook study through the Dental Board of New South Wales and was apprenticed to his father as a dental student. Albert Medal On 12 January 1929, Kavanaugh was swimming at Bondi Beach approximately from the shore when fourteen-year-old Colin Stewart was attacked by a shark and dragged underwater. The shark inflicted severe wounds to Stewart's side and hip, and Kavanaugh--who was located only a few metres away--immediately swam to his assistance. The shark made a second pass at Stewart as Kavanaugh neared. Securing a hold on Stewart, Kavanaugh struggled towards the shore. As the pair neared, they were assisted by two other men who dragged Stewart ashore, where he received medical attention before being rushed to hospital. Stewart subsequently died of his injuries the following morning. The coroner who investigated the incident commented on Kavanaugh's \\"heroic act\\", and noted that he should be decorated with the highest honour possible for the circumstances. For his actions, Kavanaugh was subsequently awarded the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia's meritorious award in silver and the Albert Medal. The announcement and accompanying citation for the latter award was published in the London Gazette on 17 October 1930, reading: Later life Following the completion of his apprenticeship, Kavanaugh was registered as a dental surgeon in June 1930. By 1933, he had established his own practice at Narromine. On 22 April that year, he married Mary Sylvia Potter, a stenographer, in a Catholic ceremony at the Sacred Heart Church, Darlinghurst; the pair would later have a son and three daughters. During this time, Kavanaugh obtained a civil flying licence and was active in the local musical and drama societies. On 7 October 1940, Kavanaugh enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force for service during the Second World War. Although wishing to be selected as a pilot, he was instead commissioned as a flight lieutenant in the medical branch as a dental officer. Promoted to squadron leader in October 1942, he served throughout the war in Australia. He was last posted to RAAF Station Bradfield Park before taking his discharge on 9 June 1945. In 1946, Kavanaugh entered the University of Sydney studying for a Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree. During his time at the university, he won the Percy A. Ash Prize in 1948 and the Annie Praed Prize in 1949, before graduating with his degree in 1950. Kavanaugh continued to practice dentistry in Sydney until the late 1950s, when he purchased Karalinga, a sheep station on the Wollondilly River, and entered semi-retirement. In his semi-retirement, Kavanaugh divided his time between Karalinga and serving as a locum tenens dentist. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, Kavanaugh and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Stanley Gibbs, William McAloney, Dick Richards and Kavanaugh, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972. Kavanaugh died of cardiac failure at the age of 69 at the Repatriation General Hospital, Concord, on 12 September 1976. He was interred in the Field of Mars Cemetery, Sydney, in the Anglican section, in the same grave as his wife Mary Sylvia, who had died on 27 July 1976, aged 68.

Overview UDBL which began operating in 1972, was the first development finance institution established by the government of Uganda. The main objective of UDBL is to promote and finance development in various sectors of the economy with particular emphasis on agriculture, industry, tourism, housing, and commerce. As of December 2019, UDBL's total assets were valued at UGX:486.37 billion (US$132.5 million). At that time, shareholders' equity was UGX:347.48 billion (US$95 million). In June 2018, the government negotiated for a $20 million (UShs76 billion) loan from the African Development Bank to capitalize UDBL, primarily to lend to the agricultural sector for mechanization and value addition. History UBDL was established in 1972. The political leadership in Uganda changed in 1979, and UDBL was then able to obtain large credits from external financiers, like the African Development Bank, the International Development Association, the European Investment Bank, the European Economic Community, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (Banque Arabe pour le Développement Economique en Afrique) (BADEA). With these funds, UDBL's focus shifted to financing medium and long term projects in agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Between 1997 and 2001, the bank was restructured, recapitalized, and re-organized as a limited liability company, wholly owned by the government of Uganda. Future plans , the bank had re-organized and repositioned itself to play a larger and more visible role in Uganda's development finance. It has developed a medium-term recapitalization plan (2013-2017) that will increase shareholder's equity from the current UGX:100 billion (US$40 million), to UGX:500 billion (US$200 million). Its growth plan has been streamlined to harmonize with Uganda's National Development Plan (NDP) and with Vision 2040. Vision 2040 aims to transform Ugandan society from a peasant population to a modern and prosperous country by the year 2040. Some of the development partners that UDBL is working with include the Kuwait Fund, the African Export-Import Bank, BADEA, and the Islamic Development Bank. In June 2020, the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, announced its intention of further increase its share capital in UDB from UShs500 billion (US$136 million) to UShs2 trillion (US$545 million). This is part of the bank's five-year strategic plan 2020–2024. Services UDB's services include short term loans, medium term loans, long term loans, equity investments, trade finance loans, and bank guarantees.

In 818, after he reneged on an offer to submit three of Pinglu's 12 prefectures to imperial control, Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against him. In 819, his officer Liu Wu turned against him and killed him, submitting to imperial authority.  Background  It is not known when Li Shidao was born. His father was Li Na, who was military governor (Jiedushi) of Pinglu Circuit from 784 to 792 and who had inherited the circuit from Li Shidao's grandfather Li Zhengji. His mother was a daughter of Li Zhengji's ally Li Baochen, who had ruled Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). He had one older half-brother, Li Shigu, who inherited the circuit after Li Na's death in 792.Old Book of Tang, vol. 124 . It was said that during Li Shigu's rule, Li Shidao was sent out of the headquarters to govern locales, and at times he was impoverished — because Li Shigu wanted him to get experience on how life was so that he would be trained. Li Shigu later made him the prefect of Mi Prefecture. It was said that he liked painting and playing the bili.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. As of 806, Li Shigu was ill, and he asked his staff members Gao Mu () and Li Gongdu () whom they planned to support as leader if he died — and when Gao and Li Gongdu did not answer quickly, Li Shigu guessed that they planned to support LI Shidao. Li Shigu tried to dissuade them — stating that while he loved Li Shidao as his brother, Li Shidao was not capable and spent his time on painting and playing bili — but did not give them any other person that he approved of. When Li Shigu died thereafter, Gao and Li Gongdu welcomed Li Shidao back to Pinglu's capital Yun Prefecture () and supported him to succeed Li Shigu.  Initial semi-submission to the imperial government  After Li Shidao took over control of the circuit, for some time, Emperor Xianzong did not issue any approvals of his takeover. When Li Shidao consulted his staff members, some suggested pillaging the nearby circuits to create pressure on the imperial government. Gao Mu earnestly opposed this, and instead proposed that Li Shidao try to receive the emperor's favor by submitting the tax revenues that Li Shigu had withheld to the imperial government, giving the imperial government the authority to commission his subordinates, and joining the imperial salt monopoly system and submitting the funds to the imperial government. Meanwhile, the chancellor Du Huangchang advocated trying to strip Li Shidao of some territory, but as Emperor Xianzong was waging a campaign against another warlord, Liu Pi, at the time, he did not want to create another battlefront. He thus made his son Li Shen () the Prince of Jian the titular military governor but commissioned Li Shidao the acting military governor and, later in the year, made Li Shidao military governor officially. In 809, there was an incident in which the great-great-grandson of the great early Tang chancellor Wei Zheng, Wei Chou (), was so impoverished that he mortgaged his ancestral home. Li Shidao offered to use his own money to pay off Wei Chou's mortgage, and Emperor Xianzong initially agreed. He had the imperial scholar Bai Juyi draft an edict approving Li Shidao's suggestion, but Bai pointed out that this is something the imperial government should do and that Emperor Xianzong should not allow Li Shidao to take credit for this. Emperor Xianzong agreed, and he used imperial treasury funds to pay off Wei's mortgage. Also in 809, Wang Shizhen the military governor of Chengde died. Emperor Xianzong was initially willing to make Wang Shizhen's son Wang Chengzong the new military governor after Wang Chengzong offered to submit two of Chengde's six prefectures to imperial control, but after Wang Chengzong reneged on the offer, Emperor Xianzong declared a campaign against Wang Chengzong. The imperial campaign stalled, however, and Li Shidao repeatedly tried to intercede on Wang Chengzong's behalf. In 810, Emperor Xianzong ended the campaign and made Wang Chengzong military governor of Chengde.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. In 812, when another ally of Li Shidao's, Tian Ji'an the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), his relative Tian Xing (later known as Tian Hongzheng) took over and submitted to imperial authority. Li Shidao later threatened to, along with Wang Chengzong, attack Tian Hongzheng, but Han Hong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), who was loyal to the imperial government, threatened to attack him if he attacked Weibo, and Li Shidao did not do so.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239.  Alliance with Wu Yuanji  In 814, another ally of Li Shidao's, Wu Shaoyang the military governor of Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), died. When Emperor Xianzong did not commission Wu Shaoyang's son Wu Yuanji to succeed Wu Shaoyang, Wu Yuanji reacted by pillaging the nearby circuits, and Emperor Xianzong ordered a campaign against Zhangyi. Both LI Shidao and Wang Chengzong tried to intercede on Wu Yuanji's behalf, but Emperor Xianzong rebuffed them. Emperor Xianzong mobilized the troops from many circuits to attack Zhangyi, but did not request troops from Pinglu. Nevertheless, Li sent 2,000 soldiers to Shouchun (壽春, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), claiming to be joining the attack against Zhangyi, but instead trying to find a way to aid Zhangyi. Meanwhile, some tens of assassins that Li had retained were suggesting to him that the way for him to save Zhangyi would be to use guerilla warfare — retain a group of bandits to burn the imperial food supplies around the eastern capital Luoyang such that the imperial government would be forced to concentrate on Luoyang's security and decrease the pressure on Zhangyi. Li agreed, and starting in summer 815, there were frequent bandit attacks near Luoyang — sufficiently frequent that many officials suggested to Emperor Xianzong to end the campaign against Zhangyi, but Emperor Xianzong refused. Li's assassins then suggested the next move — assassinate the chancellor Wu Yuanheng, whom Emperor Xianzong had put in charge of the logistics of the operations against Zhangyi. Li agreed, and sent them with sufficient funds to the capital Chang'an to carry out the operation. Shortly after, Wu Yuanheng was assassinated, and the assassins also attacked another official in favor of the campaign against Wu Yuanji, Pei Du, but failed to kill Pei. Suspicions quickly fell on soldiers that Wang had sent to Chang'an as liaisons — as Wang had, shortly before, submitted a petition that attacked Wu Yuanheng bitterly. Wang's liaisons were arrested and, probably under torture, confessed to assassinating Wu Yuanheng. Emperor Xianzong thus declared Wang a renegade, while, at that point, not suspecting Li, and his assassins were able to flee Chang'an without being arrested. When some officials suggested ending the campaign against Zhangyi, Emperor Xianzong firmly refused, and further made Pei chancellor. Meanwhile, Li was planning another attack on Luoyang. He had a detachment of Pinglu soldiers stationed at Luoyang, serving as his liaisons, and they were led by the Buddhist monk Yuanjing (), who had previously been an officer under Shi Siming during the Anshi Rebellion. They planned to burn the imperial palaces and carry out a slaughter of Luoyang's population. The plot was leaked to the imperial defender of Luoyang, Lü Yuanying (), however, and Lü mobilized his guards and surrounded the Pinglu liaison office. The Pinglu soldiers fought their way out into the hills south of Luoyang, but later, with them pillaging the prey of the hill hunters in the region, the hunters led the imperial troops to their location, and they were mostly captured and executed. After Lü interrogated two of the Pinglu officers, Zi Jiazhen () and Men Cha (), he found out the extent of Li Shidao's plot and further found out that Wu Yuanheng was assassinated by assassins sent by Li, not Wang Chengzong. Lü submitted a secret petition pointing out that Li was even more treasonous than Wu Yuanji and Wang. Emperor Xianzong agreed, but as he was already waging two campaigns simultaneously against Wu and Wang, he could not declare a third one against Li at that time. By late 815, Li was openly attacking Xu Prefecture (徐州, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), belonging to neighboring Wuning Circuit (武寧, headquartered at Xu Prefecture), to try to distract the imperial forces. The Wuning officer Wang Zhixing, however, was able to defeat the Pinglu troops. After the imperial generals Li Guangyan and Wu Chongyin captured the Zhangyi outpost Lingyun Fence (陵雲柵, in modern Luohe, Henan) in fall 816, however, Li became apprehensive and submitted a petition offering to submit. Emperor Xianzong, having no ability to attack him at the moment, gave him the honorary title of acting Sikong (司空, one of the Three Excellencies). During these anti- imperial government actions of Li Shidao's, Gao Mu, Li Gongdu, and Guo Hu () repeatedly urged him not to act against the imperial government. Li Shidao's close associates Li Wenhui () and Li Ying (), however, accused Gao and Li Gongdu of being disloyal. Li Shidao eventually executed Gao and imprisoned Guo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. Li Shidao continued to be concerned about Zhangyi's viability, and he sent his officer Liu Yanping () to secretly head to Zhangyi to confer with Wu Yuanji. Liu had to get by the imperial lines carefully, and when he arrived at Zhangyi, Wu gave him many gifts and sent him back to Liu. When Liu returned to Pinglu, however, he reported to Li that Wu was not diligent, was wasting time in games with his wife and concubines, and was not able in military matters. Liu predicted an imminent defeat for Wu. Li, who had hoped for a more optimistic report, did not want to hear this, and he soon thereafter found an excuse to put Liu to death. As the Song Dynasty historian Hu Sanxing commented:Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 58 [817].  Campaign against imperial government  In late 817, the imperial general Li Su captured Wu Yuanji, who was soon executed. When the news of Wu's defeat reached Li Shidao and Wang Chengzong, both became fearful. Wang again offered to surrender two of his six prefectures to imperial control and further sent his two sons to Chang'an to serve as hostages, and Emperor Xianzong accepted his submission. Li Gongdu and another officer, Li Yingtan (), thus persuaded Li Shidao to submit three of his 12 prefectures — Yi (沂州, in modern Linyi, Shandong), Mi, and Hai (海州, in modern Lianyungang, Jiangsu) to imperial control and to send his oldest son Li Hongfang ()New Book of Tang, vol. 213 . to Chang'an as a hostage. Emperor Xianzong initially agreed, and he sent the official Li Sun () to Pinglu to comfort Li Shidao. However, it was said that by this point, Li Shidao was only often conferring on the key matters with his wife Lady Wei, household servants Hu Weikan () and Yang Ziwen (), the female servants Ladies Pu and Yuan, and the scribe Wang Zaisheng (). Lady Wei did not want to send Li Hongfang to Chang'an, and she, along with Ladies Pu and Yuan, argued that Pinglu should not weaken itself by submitting three prefectures. Instead, they argued that if he did not do so, the imperial government would, at most, attack, and that if Pinglu could try to fight and submit the three prefectures only if it was losing on the battlefield. Li Shidao agreed, and he further considered executing Li Gongdu. Only at the intercession of another staff member, Jia Zhiyan (), was Li Gongdu spared, but Li Yingtan was executed. When Li Sun arrived at Pinglu, Li Shidao promised to send Li Hongfang to Chang'an, but Li Sun could see that Li Shidao was not intending to do so. Once Li Sun returned to Chang'an and reported this to Emperor Xianzong, soon, Li Shidao submitted a petition stating that the soldiers would not permit him to submit the three prefectures and hostage. Emperor Xianzong, in anger, declared a campaign against Li Shidao, mobilizing the troops of Xuanwu, Weibo, Yicheng (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), Wuning, and Henghai (橫海, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) to attack Pinglu. Soon, the armies of these circuits were continuously dealing Pinglu forces defeats, and by winter 818, Tian Hongzheng's Weibo army had crossed the Yellow River and approached Pinglu's capital Yun Prefecture (). Despite these defeats, it was said that Li Shidao did not like to hear news of defeats, and when Li Su, then the military governor of Wuning, captured Jinxiang (金鄉, in modern Jining, Shandong), Li Shidao's staff members did not dare to inform him, and Li Shidao did not know about Jinxiang's fall even until his death. Meanwhile, with the soldiers clamoring for Li Wenhui to be held responsible, Li Shidao demoted Li Wenhui out of the headquarters, and he released Guo and another staff member who advocated submission to the imperial government, Li Cun (). At this point, Pinglu's main forces were under the command of Liu Wu, who was known for being lenient to the soldiers and gaining their support, and stationed at Yanggu (陽穀, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong), to defend against Tian's Weibo army, but Tian was repeatedly dealing Liu defeats. Someone warned Li Shidao that Liu might be up to no good, and Li Shidao summoned Liu back to Yun Prefecture to attend a meeting, intending to execute him. However, at another person's urging, pointing out that killing Liu would lead the officers to all lose faith, Li Shidao changed his mind and, after the meeting, sent Liu back to Yanggu and gave him much rewards to calm him. Because Liu Wu's son Liu Congjian served as a guard for Li Shidao, Liu Wu nevertheless found out about Li Shidao's original thoughts and began to take precautions. Li Shidao soon resolved again to kill Liu Wu. On March 7, 819, Li Shidao sent two messengers to Liu Wu's deputy Zhang Xian (), ordering Zhang to execute Liu and take over the army. Zhang, however, was friendly with Liu, and he quickly informed Liu. Liu thus had the two messengers arrested and executed. That night, Liu informed the army the events that were occurring and stated that he was intending to make a surprise attack on Yun Prefecture and submit to imperial authority. When some officers hesitated, he executed them, and the other officers agreed to follow him. Early morning March 8, Liu made a surprise advancement toward Yun Prefecture, entering the city despite some opposition by the troops defending the city. Li Shidao's guards soon surrendered. Li Shidao hid with his two sons, but were eventually found and captured. Li Shidao still wanted to meet Liu and plead for his life, but Li Hongfang pointed out that they could not live anyway and that it was better to die quickly. Later that morning, Li Shidao and his two sons were executed by Liu. Liu delivered the heads of Li Shidao and his two sons to Tian, and Tian soon arrived and took over control of the circuit for the imperial government. Emperor Xianzong divided Pinglu into three smaller circuits. Initially, no one dared to bury Li Shidao's body, until one Shi Yingxiu () did so. Later, the new military governor Ma Zong () reburied Li Shidao's body with ceremony due a scholar, not a general. Li Shidao's wife Lady Wei and his youngest son were spared but made palace servants — purportedly spared only because Liu had an affair with Lady Wei and falsely reported her to be a descendant of Wei Zheng's. Li Shidao's cousins were exiled.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 124. * New Book of Tang, vol. 213. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 237, 238, 239, 240, 241.

Once one of Korea's largest Buddhist temples, the complex was mostly destroyed by US bombing in 1951, and today it lies in ruins; however, it is slated to be reconstructed in coming years. It is listed as National Treasure #94 History Founded at the end of the Koryo dynasty in 1386, work continued on the temple into the Choson era. Consisting of over 50 buildings, the temple was once one of Korea's largest. During the Japanese occupation, the temple, known under its Japanized name as Shakuō-ji, became a popular tourist destination on the Seoul-Wonsan railway. Unfortunately, almost all of the historic buildings in the temple compound have been destroyed; many were completely obliterated by a 1951 US bombing raid during the Korean War, and the remaining buildings, including a few reconstructions, were later destroyed by heavy flooding in 1986. The temple's many original art treasures, likewise, were incinerated in the raid.. Today, there are only four buildings standing, three of which are reconstructions; only Jogye Gate remains of the original buildings. Only foundation stones remain of the rest of the temple's structures. Some reconstruction work is set to be completed by Kim Il Sung's 100th birthday in 2012. Composition The temple was arranged with two main axes (known as the west and east Courts), with shrines, living quarters, and kitchens arranged around a courtyard fronting a main prayer hall. The east court was the larger of the two, and contained the temple's most impressive buildings and most valuable pieces of art. The temple's entrance is through Puri Gate (, \\"Gate of Nonduality\\"), situated on a stone bridge over a quiet stream. This bridge symbolically represents the link between the mundane world and the sanctified temple precincts. It was one of the few buildings to survive the American bombing of 1951, but was later washed away by flooding in 1986. It has since been reconstructed. A winding path leads to the temple's second gate, Jogye Gate (조계문/), which allowed entrance to the main temple. Completed in 1783, the gate is the only original building remaining. With a heavy tiles roof supported by only two small wooden pillars, the gate is the temple's most unusual feature and known as one of the most beautiful temple gates in Korea. The gate is estimated to have a combined weight of 100 tonnes. It is often shown as an example of the sophisticated architectural techniques of the Joseon era. In the courtyard between Jogye Gate and the ruins of the east court stands Sŏlsŏngdong Pavilion (), a two-storied construct first built in 1730. Originally located overlooking the stream, the pavilion was rebuilt after the Korean war only to be knocked over during a particularly heavy flood. It was moved to this location when it was again reconstructed in 1987. Of the grand east court, only the reconstructed Hoji Gate (, \\"Gate of Sustaining\\") exists. Originally built in 1392, the gate originally housed ornate statues of the Four Heavenly Kings. The gate burnt down during the Korean war along with the rest of the temple, but was rebuilt afterward. Taeung Hall () was built in 1731 as the temple's main prayer hall. As the focal point of the east court, it was by far the largest and most impressive buildings in the compound. It also housed many of the temple's greatest treasures a collection of icons and nine statues of various Buddhist guardians, saints (arhats), and deities. Unfortunately, it too was completely destroyed by the American forces in 1951. Reconstruction on it is slated to begin in 2009. Of the smaller west court, only foundation stones remain. Ŭngjin Hall (), located at its center, was the first of the temple buildings to be constructed and the court's main prayer hall.. The hall was begun in 1386 at the end of the Koryo dynasty and later finished under the Yi. It housed a statue of Buddha, as well as icons of five hundred of his disciples. Unfortunately, this hall was too completely destroyed by US bombing in 1951. To its east and west stood Inji and Ryongbi Pavilions, which were reconstructed after the war but destroyed during the 1986 floods. Hidden behind the ruins of the western court is the temple cemetery, including many stele commemorating the temple's greatest monks. The gravestones are listed as Cultural asset #311.

Merriam, Springfield, Mass., p. 33, with an estimated population of around 202,000. The population at the 1984 census was 38,174. Between 1983 and 1995 it was the administrative center of al-Khums District. Etymology The name al-Khums or Khoms ()Fisher, Morris (1985) Provinces and provincial capitals of the world (2nd edition) Scarecrow Press, Metuchen, New Jersey, page 88, translated literally to \\"the quintile\\" in Arabic. The origin of the name is not clear. Several hypotheses include: * In Tripolitania the quinary numeral system was used in contrary to most other Arabic cultures, which used the decimal system. Khums and neighbouring villages were famous in producing olives and olive oil. Since the olives had to be counted, residents of other cities started to call the inhabitants 'Khumsi' (Quinary), from which the name Khums derived. * Khums could be an Arabic translation to the Greek word Pentapolis which means five cities, but this hypothesis is dubious, because Pentapolis and its cities are in Cyrenaica. * Another hypothesis is that during the 16th century, al-Khums produced a quintile (20%) of the Ottoman Tripolitania province's olive oil. During the Italian occupation of Libya, the city was called Homs in official Italian sources. History Leptis Magna The city was founded by the Phoenicians around 1000 BCE, who gave it the name Lpqy. Written LPQ (Punic: 𐤋𐤐𐤒) or LPQY (𐤋𐤐𐤒𐤉). This has been tentatively connected to the Semitic root (present in Arabic) LFG, meaning \\"to build\\" or \\"to piece together\\", presumably in reference to the construction of the city. Birley, Anthony Richard (1971) Septimius Severus Eyre and Spottiswoode, London, page 2, The town did not become prominent until Carthage became a major power in the Mediterranean Sea in the 4th century BCE. It nominally remained part of Carthage's dominions until the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BCE and then became part of the Roman Republic. Soon Roman merchants settled in the city and started a profitable commerce with the Libyan interior. The republic of Rome sent some colonists together with a small garrison in order to control the city. Since then the city started to grow and was even allowed to mint its own coins. Leptis Magna in the east of Khums Leptis Magna remained as such until the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius, when the city and the surrounding area were formally incorporated into the empire as part of the province of Africa. It soon became one of the leading cities of Roman Africa and a major trading post. Leptis achieved its greatest prominence beginning in 193 CE, when the ethnically Punic Lucius Septimius Severus became emperor. He favored his hometown above all other provincial cities, and the buildings and wealth he lavished on it made Leptis Magna the third-most important city in Africa, rivaling Carthage and Alexandria. In 205 CE, he and the imperial family visited the city and received great honors. Severan Basilica Among the changes that Severus introduced were to create a magnificent new forum and to rebuild the docks. The natural harbour had a tendency to silt up, but the Severan changes made this worse, and the eastern wharves are extremely well preserved, since they were scarcely used. Leptis over-extended itself at this period. During the Crisis of the 3rd Century, when trade declined precipitously, Leptis Magna's importance also fell into a decline, and by the middle of the 4th century, even before it was completely devastated by the 365 tsunami, large parts of the city had been abandoned. Ammianus Marcellinus recounts that the crisis was worsened by a corrupt Roman governor named Romanus during a major tribal raid who demanded bribes to protect the city. The ruined city could not pay these and complained to the emperor Valentinian. Romanus then bribed people at court and arranged for the Leptan envoys to be punished \\"for bringing false accusations\\". It enjoyed a minor renaissance beginning in the reign of the emperor Theodosius I. In 439 CE, Leptis Magna and the rest of the cities of Tripolitania fell under the control of the Vandals when their king, Gaiseric, captured Carthage from the Romans and made it his capital. Unfortunately for the future of Leptis Magna, Gaiseric ordered the city's walls demolished so as to dissuade its people from rebelling against Vandal rule. The people of Leptis and the Vandals both paid a heavy price for this in 523 CE when a group of Berber raiders sacked the city. Belisarius recaptured Leptis Magna in the name of Rome ten years later, and in 534 CE, he destroyed the kingdom of the Vandals. Leptis became a provincial capital of the Eastern Roman Empire (see Byzantine Empire) but never recovered from the destruction wreaked upon it by the Berbers. It was the site of a massacre of Berber chiefs of the Leuathae tribal confederation by the Roman authorities in 543 CE. Historian Theodore Mommsen wrote that under Byzantine rule the city was fully Christian.Theodore Mommsen. \\"The Provinces of the Roman Empire\\". section:Africa During the decade 565-578 CE Christian missionaries from Leptis Magna even began to move once more among the Amazigh tribes as far south as the Fezzan in the Libyan desert and converted the Garamantes. But the city's decline - linked even to the Sahara's desertification - continued, even though new churches were built, and by the time of the Arab conquest of Tripolitania in the 650s, the city was nearly abandoned except for a Byzantine garrison force. The progressive growth of arid land around Leptis reduced its importance and the port was blocked by the accumulation of sand. As a consequence, when Arabs arrived around 640 CE and later conquered Leptis, they found only a little garrison and a small city of less than 1,000 inhabitants. Under Arab domination Leptis disappeared: by the 10th century the city was forgotten and fully covered by sand.Silvia Bullo. \\"Provincia Africa: Leptis Magna\\". pg 185-188 Islamic rule Leptis Magna and Tripolitania were conquered by Amr ibn al-Aas and soon after that, a lot of Arabs settled in the city near the ruins of Leptis Magna while most of the native Berber tribes living there converted to Islam.History of Arabic Conquest in Libya by Al Zawwy (تاريخ الفتح العربي في ليبيا للزاوي) For the next few centuries the control of the city shifted between Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, Abbasid Caliphate, Fatimid Caliphate, Zirids, Kingdom of Africa, Almohad Caliphate and Hafsids before felling under the control of Ottomans in the 1550s. The city became the capital of The Fifth Sanjak (which included the cities of Misurata, Sirte, Zliten, Bani Walid and Msalata), an administrative division of Ottoman Tripolitania until World War I and the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Italian Libya \\"Murqub Martyrs Monument\\" in Khums The Italians colonized Libya in 1911, and on 10 October of the same year a major battle between natives and Italian Army occurred in Murqub Castle in Khums and another on in the same place on 27 February 1912. Both battles named Battle of Murqub are considered as two of the most important battles during the Italian colonizing of Libya. Muammar Gaddafi later claimed that his grandfather died in this battle.History of Libyan Jihad Book (كتاب تاريخ الجهاد الليبي) Libya remained under Italian rule until World War II. During World War II Khums was occupied by the Allies and from 1942 until 1951, when Libya gained independence, Tripolitania and the region of Cyrenaica were administered by the British Military Administration. Italy formally renounced its claim upon the territory in 1947. Libyan Independence and Gaddafi regime Bashir Saadawi, born in Khums, was one of the major figures who contributed to Libyan independence. He was the founder of the National Congress Party which supported a Republic instead of a Monarchy. When King Idris I was crowned as King of Libya, all political parties were disbanded and Saadawi was exiled to Beirut where he remained until his death on 17 January 1957. King Idris (Far Right). Khums remained part of Tripolitania province until 1962 when the Federal system canceled and replaced by Muhafazah governorates system (muhafazah) system, and this system remained even after the 1969 coup d'état and through the Libyan Arab Republic, until superseded by the 1983 Baladiyat districts system. The baladiyat system was itself dropped in 1995 and replaced by thirteen districts named shabiyat. Despite the changes, Khums remained as a separate district under the name of al-Khums or Murqub. Libyan Civil War Khums remained under control of Gaddafi forces through most of the war until rebels from Misrata entered and captured the city on 23 August before moving on to Tripoli.  Climate Al- Khums has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh).  Al- Khums municipality  Al-Khums municipality was once part of Murqub District and its capital, since 2013 the 22 Shabiya divided into 90 Municipalities; and so al-Khums was separated from Zliten. , al-Khums Municipality consists of some small towns on the outskirts of al-Khums Centre, including Lebda, Seleen, El-Sahel and Suuq El-Khamis.

The port itself consists of nine medium-sized berths (numbers 12 to 19) with lengths ranging from 75 to 530 meters and maximum drafts ranging from 8 to 12 meters depending on the berth. In June 2018, the container ship Maersk Alexander rescued 113 refugees in the Mediterranean sea during her voyage en route from al-Khums to Malta. The ship had been directed to do so by MRCC Rome after a distress message was received from the boat with 113 refugees. After an initial refusal of permission to berth at Sicily, the refugees were subsequently disembarked at the Italian port of Pozallo.

The office was also called Jeongwon, Huwon, Eundae, or Daeeonsa. According to the Gyeongguk daejeon (Complete Codes of Law), the Seungjeongwon had 6 Royal Secretaries (Seungji 承旨), whose ranks were in the 3rd senior grade, as well as two recorders (juseo 注書). The duties of the royal secretaries were primarily to deliver the monarch's orders to government organizations (under the Joseon administrative system the monarch never delivered his orders directly to any government office) and to report on official affairs of the state organizations to the throne. The six secretary system is explained by the fact that the government of Joseon was composed of six Boards (or Ministries). The six secretaries served respectively the Boards of Personnel, War, Taxation, Rites, Works, and Punishment. However, the secretaries were not limited to liaison work between the Six Boards and the monarch; they also reported to the king the business of all government offices, primary among these being the State Council (Uijeong-bu), the Office of Censor-General (Saganwon), and the Office of Inspector-General (Saheon-bu).Tai-jin Kim. 1976.

On the 24 August 2008 it was acquired by the Danish National Bank after running into financial trouble due to the decline of the Danish property market. The Bank remains formally listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, but trading has been suspended. The Bank had approximately 32,000 shareholders.

Church L.M.S people of Trivandrum worshipped in a Church constructed by the Protestant evangelical trust in the 1830s. Rev. Samuel Sumanam father of Mr. S.I. Sumanam from Paraniyam was working in that Church as an Evangelist from 1878 onwards. The Trivandrum L.M.S. Church became a pastorate in 1895 and Mr. Mathew Kesari, father of Rev. John M. Kesari and grandfather of Rev. J. Eben Kesari was the first Indian to be ordained as the pastor of that Church. Rev. Mathew Kesari retired from service in 1904 when the new Church was still under construction. His son John M. Kesari was the first pastor of the newly constructed Mateer Memorial Church, his period of service being from April 1905 to March, 1913.  Architecture  The architecture is in the simple Hallenkirche (Hall Church) style. The Church building is in granite, with a square bell tower with a vestibule beneath and a roof supported by Gothic arches. The Celtic cross is made of cut stone, and commemorates Rev. Mateer’s Irish background.  Rev. Samuel Mateer  Rev. Samuel Mateer, after whom the church was named, was the first missionary who endeavored to grow an indigenous Church. He prepared local people for Church ministry and tried to transfer administrative responsibilities to them. It was during his tenure that a number of local people were ordained as ministers. As far as the diocese is concerned, Rev. Samuel Mateer can be designated as the pioneer of indigenization of the Church. When he arrived there were 25 congregations, 3000 Christians and an annual income of Rs. 800/-. But when he took leave after 33 years, the number of Congregations had increased to 56, Christians to 10,060 and annual income to Rs. 3000/- In 1890, Mrs. Mateer had to return to England owing to ill health. Rev. Samuel Mateer went to England in 1891 on leave, and died there on 24 December 1893. It was in the same year that the Trivandrum Church was elevated to the position of a pastorate. The Church building constructed in the LMS Compound and dedicated to the loving memory of Rev. Samuel Mateer was opened for divine worship on 1 December 1906, along with the Centenary Celebrations of the London Missionary Society.  Cathedral  Elevating the Church as Cathedral Church was under consideration in 2010. Since then, the diocese has decided on building a new church for the purpose.

About 75% of its areal distribution occurs in Brazil, from Mato Grosso to Rio Grande do Sul states. The remainder area is distributed in eastern Paraguay, northeastern Argentina and northern Uruguay. The shape of the depression is roughly elliptical and covers an area of about . The Paraná River, from which the Paraná Basin derived its name, flows along the central axis of the Paraná Basin and drains it.  Description  The Paraná Basin stretches from the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso in the north to northern Argentina and Uruguay in the south. The southern portion in Uruguay is locally known as Norte Basin.De Santa Ana et al., 2004, p.88Daners et al., 2006, p.148  Pioneer studies  Mesosaurus skeleton reconstruction (MacGregor, 1908)MacGregor, 1908 David White (1908).White, David (1908) Flora Fóssil das Coal Measures do Brasil, pp. 337-617 + 14 estampas (inglês) IN: White, I.C.

Edição facsimilar de 1988, DNPM The first study on the Brazilian side of the Paraná Basin dates from 1841, when a Brazilian Imperial Government Mission prospected for coal. Turning point in the basin's geological understanding was the \\"White Report\\", published in 1908 by the American geologist Israel C. White, head of the \\"Comissão de Estudos das Minas de Carvão de Pedra do Brasil\\" (Commission for Studies on Brazilian Coal Mines). One of the main results of these studies, besides the reconnaissance for coal, was the discovery of Mesosaurus fossils within Permian black shales (Irati Formation), and the Glossopteris flora within the Permian coals. White was one of the first to propose the equivalence between the South American Permian strata and similar rocks of the Karoo Basin in South Africa.White, 1908  Basin evolution  The basin developed during the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic with a sedimentary record comprising rocks from the Ordovician right up to the Cretaceous, thus spanning the time interval between 460 and 66 million years. The maximum thickness of the infill reaches in its central area and is composed of sedimentary and igneous rocks.Milani et al., 2007aZalán et al., 1991Milani et al., 2007b The sedimentary cover extends across various Precambrian geologic provinces: the Río de la Plata Craton, the Mantiqueira Province, the Luis Alves craton fragment, the Tocantins Province and the Paranapanema block. This last province is distinct in that it is wholly covered by basin sediments and therefore poorly known.Mantovani et al., 2010 The Paraná Basin is a typical intra-cratonic flexural basin, although during the Paleozoic it was a gulf that opened to the southwest. The basin genesis is related to the convergence between the former Gondwana supercontinent and the oceanic crust of the former Panthalassa ocean. The basin formed, at least during the Paleozoic Gondwanide orogeny, as a foreland basin.Melo, 1988 In the Permian and Triassic the area between Asunción and Río Grande was uplifted in connection to the Gondwanide orogeny effectively splitting the basin in the two.Rossello et al., 2006 The piling up of material in Bolivia and the Argentine Northwest during the Andean orogeny caused the Asunción arch, a forebulge, to develop in Paraguay. The Asunción arch makes up the modern western boundary of Paraná Basin.  Stratigraphy  The sedimentary column of the Paraná Basin was divided by Milani in 1997,Milani, 1997 into six second order allostratigraphic supersequences (in the sense of Vail, 1977).Vail et al., 1977 These sequences define the stratigraphic framework of the basin and are bound by distinct depositional hiati, caused by erosive events. ;Rio Ivaí Supersequence The basal supersequence, deposited during the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian, is constituted by three formations: Alto Garças Formation composed mainly of sandstones, Rio Ivaí Formation, represented by glacial Ordovician deposits that affected large areas of Gondwana and the Vila Maria Formation, a thick muddy sequence rich in fossil content: graptolites, trilobites, brachiopods and chitinozoa. ;Paraná Supersequence This Devonian supersequence is represented, at the base, by sheet-like, cross-bedded coarse to medium sandstones of the Furnas Formation and, on top, by a muddy section, rich in macrofossils and forming a potential petroleum source rock, named Ponta Grossa Formation. ;Gondwana I Supersequence The Carboniferous to Early Triassic Gondwana I Supersequence has two distinctive features: * The major glaciation that covered almost all southern portions of Gondwana, known as Karoo Ice Age. The glaciation's apex was reached during the Mississippian (Early Carboniferous), stopping any further sedimentation until the onset of deglaciation during the Westphalian (Late Carboníferous). Left behind were huge glacial deposits, which are composed mainly by sandstones, diamictites, conglomerates and muddy rocks, grouped in the Itararé Group. Typical glacial facies are widespread, e.g., varvites. * During the Middle Permian the waning glaciation allowed the flourishing of the Glossopteris flora in the sandstones of the Rio Bonito Formation and the development of huge coal deposits, extracted in southern Brazil and Uruguay since the 19th century. Finally, during the Late Permian the Irati Formation was deposited, represented by bituminous shale, a potential petroleum source rock, and famous worldwide for its Mesosaurus fauna. The top of this supersequence defines the end of the marine phase. ;Gondwana II Supersequence Flood basalt outcrops, Serra Geral Formation, Iguaçu Falls, Brazil-Argentina border This Triassic supersequence marks the beginning of continental sedimentation. The Santa Maria Group comprises the Candelária, Caturrita and Santa Maria Formations. In the Santa Maria Formation, it bears an important reptile and mammal fauna, that can be correlated to the African continent. ;Gondwana III Supersequence The Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Gondwana III Supersequence is marked by two major events: * The great desertification of the still united Gondwana supercontinent, the \\"Botucatu desert\\" with an area up to . The large sand dune fields left behind thick, coarse to fine sandstones beds, the Botucatu Formation, housing the important Guaraní Aquifer, one of the world's largest aquifer systems. * Above the Botucatu Formation, a large igneous province was formed by the Serra Geral Formation, part of the Paraná and Etendeka traps, enormous flood basalts that occurred 137 to 127 million years ago, associated with the rifting of Gondwana and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Until today, the surface area still reaches more than . The thickness of the flood basalts amounts to and their area extends to the Etendeka basin in Namibia and Angola even into Southwestern Africa. ;Bauru Supersequence A Cretaceous supersequence occurring in the north-central part of the basin and composed mainly of sandy-conglomeratic deposits. The northeasternmost part of the basin contains the Goio-Erê Formation, dating to the Turonian.Manzig et al., 2014, p.2 ;Neogene cover In the Argentinian part of the basin, the Serra Geral Formation is overlain by the Huayquerian Ituzaingó Formation that underlies the Pleistocene Toropí and Yupoí Formations.Franco et al., 2013, p.41 Older Neogene formations in the basin comprise the Late Miocene Paraná Formation.Martín Pérez, 2013, p.51 The Uruguayan part of the basin contains the Late Pleistocene (Lujanian) Dolores and Sopas Formations and the Brazilian portion hosts the Lujanian Touro Passo Formation.Kerber et al., 2014, p.250  Natural resources  The main natural resources extracted in Paraná Basin are groundwater, coal and oil shale. ;Groundwater The Guaraní Aquifer is one of the world's largest aquifer systems and an important source of fresh water in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The lithology of the Aquifer consists mainly of highly permeable sandstones of the Botucatu and Pirambóia formations. The aquifer covers with an estimated volume of about of water. O Aqüífero Guarani - The Guarani Aquifer ;Energy resources * Coal: The Brazilian coal resources are estimated at 32 billion metric tons (32 Pg), classified as bituminous to sub-bituminous coal and are mainly associated with sandstones of the Rio Bonito Formation.

Cairo of the Mamluks. I.B. Tauris: New York, NY. 2007. He was very influential in his time, including his work on some important building structures in Cairo. He is also a controversial figure, who was removed from his post and executed in 1411. The Madrasa of Jamal al-Din One of Jamal al-Din’s biggest contributions to the Cairo landscape was his role in designing the Madrasa of Jamal al-Din in 1407, an elaborate cruciform madrasa dedicated to all four schools of law. It is located in the al-jamaliyah district of Cairo Egypt, a district whose name comes from him and the architectural influence he had. The design and decoration of this madrasa was quite ornate, as Jamal al-Din took some of the materials from the deteriorating madrasa of al-Ashraf. This was a practice often utilized by Mamluk’s throughout history, perhaps as a cost saving mechanism. The madrasa is in the four-iwan layout, meaning it contains four different hallways, and each hallway faced an open courtyard in the center. It contains all of the features generally found in a religious building, including a bent entryway, a tomb, and an ablution area. However, the building of this madrasa was not without controversy, as it is alleged that Jamal al-Din over-invested materials and capital in order to enhance it and model it after a palace with the intention of retiring in it. He eventually faced public disgrace, and al-Din Faraj executed Jamal al-Din and annulled his transactions that went into making the madrasa in 1411. However, he refrained from tearing it down, and it still stands to this day. The madrasa received earthquake damage in 1992 to go along with centuries of weather and general wear, but it was restored with the help of the Ministry of Culture.

The civil parish of Hugglescote and Donington le Heath was reinstated by an order made in May 2010, and the new parish council held its first meeting in May 2011. Manor The manor was held by Hugh le Despencer in 1217 and was in various hands until 1464 when the king granted it to William Hastings.Curtis, John (1831). A Topographical History of the County of Leicester. Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W. Hextall. p. 79 In 1463 William Beaumont, 2nd Viscount Beaumont held the manors of Donington and Hugglescote. However, in the Wars of the Roses Beaumont had fought for the House of Lancaster so he was attaindered and Edward IV granted Donington and Hugglescote to the Yorkist courtier William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings. As of 1831 the Marquis of hastings was lord of the manor.Curtis (1831), p. 79 The Hastings family's manor house has been lost. It had a formal garden in which a red brick building was erected in about 1700 and altered in about 1820. The building survives but part of its stone slate roof has collapsed. Church and chapels Church of England There was an old Church of England chapel of ease in Dennis Street which was replaced by a Georgian chapel of Saint James in 1776.The Official Guide to North West Leicestershire, undated publication Hugglescote's population outgrew the chapel and so the present Church of England parish church of Saint John the Baptist was built on a new site in Grange Road and consecrated in 1879. St. John's is a Gothic Revival building designed by the architect J. B. Everard in an Early English style. The first vicar, Canon H. E. Broughton, was installed in 1878 and died in office in 1924. He is commemorated by a reredos installed in St. John's in 1937 and a nearby road-name, Broughton Street. St. John's is built largely of local materials: Charnwood granite rubble, Swithland slate, Ibstock brick and Coalville ceramic floor tiles. The nave has five-bay arcades with Shap granite columns and a clerestory with paired lancet windows. St. John's has a transeptal south chapel and a central belltower over the crossing. The building was extended in 1887. The tower has a ring of eight bells, all cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1900. St. John's is a Grade II* listed building. Wesleyan Chapel, now Hugglescote Methodist Church. The original 1831 chapel is on the left. The larger building on the right was added in 1891. St. John's has an Elizabethan chalice dating from 1575 and a parish chest from the former chapel. The parish registers date from 1564.Introduction to Coalville, local publication, circa 1970 St. John's is the largest place of worship in the area, seating some 600 people. It is now part of a combined benefice with the parishes of Ellistown and Snibston. Methodist A Wesleyan chapel in Station Road was completed in 1831 and extended in 1891. It is now Hugglescote Methodist Church. Baptist Hugglescote had a Baptist chapel in Dennis Street. The building is now closed but the Baptist congregation continues to worship in Hugglescote Community Primary School. Economic and social history 26 and 28 Dennis Street, built 1583 (timber-framed part on right) and extended 1761 (all-brick part on left) 16 Dennis Street, built in the 17th century A few historic cottages survive in Dennis Street. 26 and 28 Dennis Street are two timber-framed cottages, one of which has the date 1583 on a collar beam and thus dates from the period that W. G. Hoskins identified as the Great Rebuilding of England. The gable end has collar and tie beams and queen struts. The building was extended eastwards in 1761. In 1960 Hoskins considered the original part of the building to be the oldest dated cottage in a Leicestershire village. 16 Dennis Street is a timber-framed cottage with brick nogging that was mainly built in the 17th century, although the original part of the cottage was built in 1590, and has some alterations from the 19th or late 18th centuries. The staircase is in a semicircular extension at the rear of the cottage. 15 Dennis Street is a cottage built of brick with a Swithland slate roof and the date 1757 on a brick over the front door. The soil is in some parts of clay but in others a light sandy loam. In 1831 the number of houses was 127 and the population 683.Curtis (1831), p. 79 Farmland in the township was enclosed in 1774. In 1945 this estate was sold by Brigadier C. L. O. Tayleur. By 1848 Donington and Hugglescote had a National School. It moved into a new building completed in 1862, and an infants' school was added in 1883. The 1862 and 1883 buildings are now Hugglescote Community Centre.Hugglescote Community Centre Construction of the Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway began in 1869 and it opened in 1873. The ANJR had a branch from through Hugglescote to . Hugglescote railway station had a junction to the north of it added in 1883, when the Charnwood Forest Railway opened from here to . The London, Midland and Scottish Railway absorbed both lines in the 1923 grouping and withdrew passenger services from both lines in 1931. Nationalisation in 1948 made the lines part of British Railways, which withdrew freight services from the Charnwood Forest line in 1963 and from the Ashby and Nuneaton line in 1971. Notable residents The Victorian hymnist, Henry Dennis (1818–87) lived in Hugglescote for forty years and is buried in the old Baptist Cemetery off Grange Road: Dennis Street is named after him. In the same cemetery is the tomb of William Stenson (1770–1861), the mining engineer and founder of Whitwick Colliery, who has sometimes been described as \\"the father of Coalville\\". Hugglescote Social Club Former National School, now Hugglescote Community Centre Hugglescote now has a Community Primary School. The buildings of its former National School (see above) are now a community centre. The village has one public house:, The Gate Inn.

Also called cluster ensembles or aggregation of clustering (or partitions), it refers to the situation in which a number of different (input) clusterings have been obtained for a particular dataset and it is desired to find a single (consensus) clustering which is a better fit in some sense than the existing clusterings. Consensus clustering is thus the problem of reconciling clustering information about the same data set coming from different sources or from different runs of the same algorithm. When cast as an optimization problem, consensus clustering is known as median partition, and has been shown to be NP-complete, even when the number of input clusterings is three. Consensus clustering for unsupervised learning is analogous to ensemble learning in supervised learning. Issues with existing clustering techniques * Current clustering techniques do not address all the requirements adequately. * Dealing with large number of dimensions and large number of data items can be problematic because of time complexity; * Effectiveness of the method depends on the definition of \\"distance\\" (for distance-based clustering) * If an obvious distance measure doesn't exist, we must \\"define\\" it, which is not always easy, especially in multidimensional spaces. * The result of the clustering algorithm (that, in many cases, can be arbitrary itself) can be interpreted in different ways. Justification for using consensus clustering There are potential shortcomings for all existing clustering techniques. This may cause interpretation of results to become difficult, especially when there is no knowledge about the number of clusters. Clustering methods are also very sensitive to the initial clustering settings, which can cause non-significant data to be amplified in non-reiterative methods. An extremely important issue in cluster analysis is the validation of the clustering results, that is, how to gain confidence about the significance of the clusters provided by the clustering technique (cluster numbers and cluster assignments). Lacking an external objective criterion (the equivalent of a known class label in supervised analysis), this validation becomes somewhat elusive. Iterative descent clustering methods, such as the SOM and k-means clustering circumvent some of the shortcomings of hierarchical clustering by providing for univocally defined clusters and cluster boundaries. Consensus clustering provides a method that represents the consensus across multiple runs of a clustering algorithm, to determine the number of clusters in the data, and to assess the stability of the discovered clusters. The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions. It can provide data for a visualization tool to inspect cluster number, membership, and boundaries. However, they lack the intuitive and visual appeal of hierarchical clustering dendrograms, and the number of clusters must be chosen a priori. The Monti consensus clustering algorithm The Monti consensus clustering algorithm is one of the most popular consensus clustering algorithms and is used to determine the number of clusters, K. Given a dataset of N total number of points to cluster, this algorithm works by resampling and clustering the data, for each K and a NXN consensus matrix is calculated, where each element represents the fraction of times two samples clustered together. A perfectly stable matrix would consist entirely of zeros and ones, representing all sample pairs always clustering together or not together over all resampling iterations. The relative stability of the consensus matrices can be used to infer the optimal K. More specifically, given a set of points to cluster, D=\\\\\\\\{e_1,e_2,...e_N\\\\\\\\}, let D^1,D^2,...,D^H be the list of H pertubed (resampled) datasets of the original dataset D, and let M^h denote the NXN connectivity matrix resulting from applying a clustering algorithm to the dataset D^h. The entries of M^h are defined as follows: M^h(i,j)= \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\text{if}\\\\text{ points i and j belong to the same cluster} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Let I^h be the NXN identicator matrix where the (i,j)-th entry is equal to 1 if points i and j are in the same perturbed dataset D^h, and 0 otherwise. The indicator matrix is used to keep track of which samples were selected during each resampling iteration for the normalisation step. The consensus matrix C is defined as the normalised sum of all connectivity matrices of all the perturbed datasets and a different one is calculated for every K. C(i,j)=\\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{h=1}^H M^h(i,j) \\\\displaystyle}{\\\\sum_{h=1}^H I^h(i,j)} \\\\right ) That is the entry (i,j) in the consensus matrix is the number of times points i and j were clustered together divided by the total number of times they were selected together. The matrix is symmetric and each element is defined within the range [0,1]. A consensus matrix is calculated for each K to be tested, and the stability of each matrix, that is how far the matrix is towards a matrix of perfect stability (just zeros and ones) is used to determine the optimal K. One way of quantifying the stability of the Kth consensus matrix is examining it's CDF curve (see below). Over-interpretation potential of the Monti consensus clustering algorithm PAC measure (proportion of ambiguous clustering) explained. Optimal K is the K with lowest PAC value. Monti consensus clustering can be a powerful tool for identifying clusters, but it needs to be applied with caution as shown by Şenbabaoğlu et al. It has been shown that the Monti consensus clustering algorithm is able to claim apparent stability of chance partitioning of null datasets drawn from a unimodal distribution, and thus has the potential to lead to over-interpretation of cluster stability in a real study. If clusters are not well separated, consensus clustering could lead one to conclude apparent structure when there is none, or declare cluster stability when it is subtle. Identifying false positive clusters is a common problem throughout cluster research, and has been addressed by methods such as SigClust and the GAP-statistic. However, these methods rely on certain assumptions for the null model that may not always be appropriate. Şenbabaoğlu et al demonstrated the original delta K metric to decide K in the Monti algorithm performed poorly, and proposed a new superior metric for measuring the stability of consensus matrices using their CDF curves. In the CDF curve of a consensus matrix, the lower left portion represents sample pairs rarely clustered together, the upper right portion represents those almost always clustered together, whereas the middle segment represent those with ambiguous assignments in different clustering runs. The proportion of ambiguous clustering (PAC) score measure quantifies this middle segment; and is defined as the fraction of sample pairs with consensus indices falling in the interval (u1, u2) ∈ [0, 1] where u1 is a value close to 0 and u2 is a value close to 1 (for instance u1=0.1 and u2=0.9). A low value of PAC indicates a flat middle segment, and a low rate of discordant assignments across permuted clustering runs. One can therefore infer the optimal number of clusters by the K value having the lowest PAC. Related work 1\\\\. Clustering ensemble (Strehl and Ghosh): They considered various formulations for the problem, most of which reduce the problem to a hyper-graph partitioning problem. In one of their formulations they considered the same graph as in the correlation clustering problem. The solution they proposed is to compute the best k-partition of the graph, which does not take into account the penalty for merging two nodes that are far apart. 2\\\\. Clustering aggregation (Fern and Brodley): They applied the clustering aggregation idea to a collection of soft clusterings they obtained by random projections. They used an agglomerative algorithm and did not penalize for merging dissimilar nodes. 3\\\\. Fred and Jain: They proposed to use a single linkage algorithm to combine multiple runs of the k-means algorithm. 4\\\\. Dana Cristofor and Dan Simovici: They observed the connection between clustering aggregation and clustering of categorical data. They proposed information theoretic distance measures, and they propose genetic algorithms for finding the best aggregation solution. 5\\\\. Topchy et al.: They defined clustering aggregation as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, and they proposed an EM algorithm for finding the consensus clustering.  Hard ensemble clustering  This approach by Strehl and Ghosh introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. They discuss three approaches towards solving this problem to obtain high quality consensus functions. Their techniques have low computational costs and this makes it feasible to evaluate each of the techniques discussed below and arrive at the best solution by comparing the results against the objective function.  Efficient consensus functions  1\\\\. Cluster-based similarity partitioning algorithm (CSPA) In CSPA the similarity between two data-points is defined to be directly proportional to number of constituent clusterings of the ensemble in which they are clustered together. The intuition is that the more similar two data-points are the higher is the chance that constituent clusterings will place them in the same cluster. CSPA is the simplest heuristic, but its computational and storage complexity are both quadratic in n. SC3 is an example of a CSPA type algorithm. The following two methods are computationally less expensive: 2\\\\. Hyper-graph partitioning algorithm (HGPA) The HGPA algorithm takes a very different approach to finding the consensus clustering than the previous method. The cluster ensemble problem is formulated as partitioning the hypergraph by cutting a minimal number of hyperedges. They make use of hMETIS which is a hypergraph partitioning package system. 3\\\\. Meta-clustering algorithm (MCLA) The meta-cLustering algorithm (MCLA) is based on clustering clusters. First, it tries to solve the cluster correspondence problem and then uses voting to place data-points into the final consensus clusters. The cluster correspondence problem is solved by grouping the clusters identified in the individual clusterings of the ensemble. The clustering is performed using METIS and Spectral clustering.  Soft clustering ensembles  Punera and Ghosh extended the idea of hard clustering ensembles to the soft clustering scenario. Each instance in a soft ensemble is represented by a concatenation of r posterior membership probability distributions obtained from the constituent clustering algorithms. We can define a distance measure between two instances using the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, which calculates the \\"distance\\" between two probability distributions. 1\\\\. sCSPA sCSPA extends CSPA by calculating a similarity matrix. Each object is visualized as a point in dimensional space, with each dimension corresponding to probability of its belonging to a cluster. This technique first transforms the objects into a label-space and then interprets the dot product between the vectors representing the objects as their similarity. 2\\\\. sMCLA sMCLA extends MCLA by accepting soft clusterings as input. sMCLA's working can be divided into the following steps: * Construct Soft Meta-Graph of Clusters * Group the Clusters into Meta-Clusters * Collapse Meta-Clusters using Weighting * Compete for Objects 3\\\\. sHBGF HBGF represents the ensemble as a bipartite graph with clusters and instances as nodes, and edges between the instances and the clusters they belong to.Solving cluster ensemble problems by bipartite graph partitioning, Xiaoli Zhang Fern and Carla Brodley, Proceedings of the twenty- first international conference on Machine learning This approach can be trivially adapted to consider soft ensembles since the graph partitioning algorithm METIS accepts weights on the edges of the graph to be partitioned. In sHBGF, the graph has n + t vertices, where t is the total number of underlying clusters. 4\\\\. Bayesian consensus clustering (BCC) BCC defines a fully Bayesian model for soft consensus clustering in which multiple source clusterings, defined by different input data or different probability models, are assumed to adhere loosely to a consensus clustering. The full posterior for the separate clusterings, and the consensus clustering, are inferred simultaneously via Gibbs sampling. Sources  References  * Alexander Strehl and J.

He immigrated to Virginia at the age of 14 in 1715.  Marriage and children  Dandridge married Frances Orlando Jones, daughter of Orlando Jones and Martha Macon Jones West, on 22 July 1730 in New Kent County, Virginia.

John became Clerk of Courts in New Kent County and kept that position for the next 26 years. He was also vestryman and churchwarden for St. Peter's Church. John was a prominent planter, and a colonel in his military district. John's older brother, William Dandridge II (1689–1743), lived on the opposite bank of the river with his wife Unity West Dandridge, daughter of Nathaniel West and wife Martha Woodard Macon, at their estate, Elsing Green, in King William County.

Early life Walker was born in Utah and grew up in Los Angeles. His father died when he was 14, and he struggled to find a place to belong in life. As a teenager he earned money painting backdrops on movie sets, and he learned to study tonalities when called upon to paint the faux finish on the fireplace in the movie Citizen Kane so it would render properly in black-and-white. He also used this time to learn about color mixing by combining leftover paints at the end of the day to create new hues. Early photographic career Walker began to learn photography some time in the late 1930s, and after World War II he established a commercial photography studio in Los Angeles. Through most of the 1950s he was in high demand for his creative advertising work that featured striking visual images and intense colors. During this time he began creating a series of highly distinctive nudes that used the Sabattier effect to meld form and surface together. He also spent much time studying the traditional collotype printing process, and he was the most prominent of a new breed of photographers who helped revive the popularity of this process. Thumbprint Press In 1964 his wife gave him a small offset press, and he began to create and publish small editions of books using photolithography to reproduce his own works. He set up his own printing house, the Thumbprint Press, at a time when there was no desktop publishing. His involvement led him to explore the chemistry and mechanics of the offset process in detail, and he experimented at length by doing such things as changing the patterns of the printing dots and overprinting images with multiple colors to achieve extraordinary saturation. He was known to have used as many as 35 colors on one image in a medium that traditionally used a standard set of only four colors. Teaching career and colleagues Walker began teaching at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles in 1966. His interest in creative photographic processes brought him to the attention of Robert Heinecken and Robert W. Fichter at UCLA, and the three co-taught classes for a brief time. In 1970 Walker accepted a one-year teaching position at the University of Florida. There he worked with photographers Jerry Uelsmann and Douglas Prince as well as printmaker Ken Kerslake, who was at that time using photo-etching techniques in intaglio printmaking. Walker taught a photo-printmaking class and a silkscreen class. In an interview in the late 1970s Walker said, \\"The contact with the ideas of the printmaker have greatly altered my attitudes toward photography, and how each discipline deals with an image.\\" Morrisey, Thomas F., \\"An Interview with Todd Walker\\", c. 1978. http://personal.riverusers.com/~jdf/todd_walker/intvw.html Accessed 6/30/09 Seven years later he moved to Tucson and taught at the University of Arizona before retiring in 1985. Late digital work While in Arizona, Walker began working with some of the first Apple computers, and he used his technical skills to create some early 3-D images of his work and to create a book in which the text was mostly generated by the computer (Enthusiasm Strengthens, 1987). According to his daughter, Walker never used Photoshop or other commercial imaging software. He wrote his own computer programs and later made use of software primarily designed for cartography. With these techniques he was able to create digital works that blurred, inverted and obscured the original image, making it into an expressive rather than detailed representation of reality. Walker died of cancer in 1998.

Since 2004, the church has received national attention over its legal case against the Episcopal Church, of which it was formerly a part, after withdrawing from it and joining another Anglican province.  History  Episcopalian origins St. James Episcopal Church was formed when the first Episcopal services were held in the Newport Harbor area, shortly after World War I. In 1941, the church was founded as a diocesan mission and in 1946 it was officially received as an Episcopal parish. Over the next three decades, the church grew and operated as an average Episcopal church. However, in 1974, the first charismatic Faith Alive service was held at St. James which was part of what is now known as the Convergence Movement. This eventually led to the three-pronged Sunday worship model, consisting of Rite I (traditional worship), Rite II (contemporary worship), and Charismatic, which continues to uniquely characterize St. James today. Starting with the leadership of Fr. David Anderson in the 1990s, the church began to play an important role in the conservative wing of the Episcopal Church. In 1996, new administration, fellowship and education facilities were completed and in 2001, a new sanctuary was completed. In 2002, Anderson retired and currently serves as Rector Emeritus. He was succeeded by Rev. Praveen Bunyan in 2003. Realignment and property disputes Years of conflict over doctrinal and ideological differences with the Episcopal Church had led to a tense and frayed relationship. Under Bunyan's leadership, steps to disassociate with the Episcopal Church were initiated as a result of controversial decisions made at the General Convention in the summer of 2003, most notably, the confirmation of the first openly gay Episcopal bishop, Gene Robinson. In August 2004, this decision, along with other theological differences, led the rector, wardens, vestry and part of the congregation to vote overwhelmingly to disaffiliate with the Episcopal Church and to affiliate with the conservative Anglican Church of Uganda and form the new church called St. James Anglican Church. St. James was soon joined in secession by All Saints Church in Long Beach and St. David's Church in North Hollywood. All three churches were then sued for their property by the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles and the national Episcopal Church. In January 2006, an Orange County Superior Court judge threw the lawsuit out, claiming that the Episcopal Church had no standing to bring their suit against St. James or the other two churches. However, in June 2007, a California appellate court reversed the decision. This led to St. James appealing the decision to the California Supreme Court, where it was widely believed that the church would win, since there was no precedent in California history for a denomination confiscating the property of a local church which held the deed. In April 2007, Bunyan resigned following allegations of inappropriate attention directed towards a female parishioner and was succeeded by an English native, the Rev. Richard Crocker, in November 2008. In January 2009, in an unexpected decision, the California Supreme Court ruled against St. James. The court stated that while the church held the deed to the multimillion-dollar property, because it was founded as an Episcopal Church, it could not take the property with it when it seceded. St. James Anglican Church was considering taking its case back to the trial court level and possibly an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. In May 2013, Judge Kim G. Dunning reaffirmed her May 1 order to return the property to the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church, sent a letter to Christianity Today magazine offering the campus of his Lake Forest, California megachurch to St. James to use if they are forced to vacate their Newport Beach property. Rev. Crocker responded to Warren's offer with the following, \\"We are overwhelmed by his generosity. It is an encouraging sign of support from Christians in the community.\\" The newly formed st James Anglican Church return the property to the Episcopal Diocese of Los Ángeles and now St. James Episcopal Church founded in 1941 returns to their property.

It did not have an official name, such as \\"Gyeongbokgung\\" (the main palace of the Joseon dynasty), because it was an imperial palace like the imperial palaces of China (e.g. \\"大內\\", \\"皇城\\"). Located in the Goryeo capital of Kaesong, the palace was burned in 1011, 1126, 1171, 1225, and 1362. The name \\"Manwoldae\\" was given to the ruins of the palace during the 14th or 15th century of the Joseon period. History Construction on the palace began in 919, at the beginning of the Goryo dynasty; it was built south of the Songak Mountains for good Feng Shui. The palace was divided into two major sections; the Kungsŏng (궁성, 宮城), where the king and royal family resided, and the Hwangsŏng (황성, 皇城), where affairs of state were conducted. Large buildings such as the Changhwa (장화전, 長和殿), and Wŏndŏk (원덕전, 元德殿) Halls contained shrines and living quarters, while Hoegyŏng Hall (회경전, 會慶殿), the largest and most impressive, contained the throne room. The complex also contained a stone astronomy tower known as the Chŏmsŏngdae (첨성대, 瞻星臺), which was used by royal astrologers. The palace was burned to the ground in 1361 when the Red Turbans invasions of Korea, sacking the city of Kaesong and forcing the king to temporary flee Andong. Contemporary records describe the palace to as containing buildings of immense proportions similar to the building sizes found in the Forbidden City. The architectural style and decoration is said to have followed the uniquely Korean royal color palette called Dancheong which is seen in other Korean palaces that still stand today. However, Mandoldae Palace is described to have contained many multistory buildings, more gold embellishments, blue and white as compared to the surviving Korean Palaces from Korea's more recent Confucian Joseon Dynasty, which stressed humility and restrain in all things. Therefore, Manwoldae gives us valuable insight into another distinct form of Korean palace architecture that had been forgotten due to foreign invasions and presently the location of these palace sites in the secluded Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Description The palace is thought to have had blue celadon roof tiles, similar to other excavated tiles dating from the same period. Excavations and findings Manwoldae as it appears today Excavation of the ruins of Manwoldae Palace began under the supervision of the North Korean government, but merged into a joint Korean cultural project. Many valuable relics of the late Goryeo period have been uncovered at the site, including ceramics, metal items, ancestral tablets, mirrors, and over 3,000 roofing tiles. It is on a list of locations planned by North Korea to become UNESCO World Heritage Sites. As of 2015, both Koreas have conducted six rounds of joint excavations of the site since 2007; the 2015 round of excavations will last 6 months, the longest excavation period to date. A 25 cm celadon jar with an inlaid monkey and tree design in an underglaze of gold found at the site is held at the National Museum of Korea. Excavation at the site uncovered a \\"unique\\" two-feet vase-like cylinder made from celadon. The object’s function was still unclear as of June 2015. The vase-like object bears an intricate pattern of peonies and vines and it used to have holes at the top and bottom; it was speculated to have been a flower pot or a vessel used for some ceremonial purpose. A modern South Korean celadon maker explains \\"the piece is unique because of its size. Due to the nature of the celadon ceramics, an object of this size would be very difficult to bake properly, even more difficult than smaller items that often emerge broken or bent from the furnace.\\" In November 2015, the excavation had unearthed a piece of metal type, with initial reports dating it from Goryeo Dynasty, but it requires further study to verify when it was made. Researchers hope to radiocarbon date the object. They are to study when it was made, what kind of font was used, and what it is made of. There are traces of ink on the type.

His compositional style was influenced by Danish folk music and by the work of Robert Schumann; Johannes Brahms; and his Danish countrymen, including J.P.E. Hartmann. Early years Lange-Müller was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark to an affluent family with a background in politics. He spent his childhood painting, reading poetry, and studying music with prominent teachers, including G. Matthison-Hansen. Poor health prevented him from attending school until 1871, when he entered conservatory to study composition. After a year, however, his father decided that he should follow his professional path and enrolled him in Copenhagen University to study political science. He was not suited for a life in politics though, and by 1874 he had become fully immersed in his compositional career. It was at this time that he and several colleagues founded Copenhagen's Concert Society. Middle years For the next quarter of a century, Lange-Müller produced a huge quantity of music, comprising some seventy-seven opus numbers. And, for several years, he conducted the Concert Society he helped to establish. However, he suffered from severe migraines (later linked to chronic eye disease), which made working at length very difficult for him. Therefore, what he could compose quickly tends to display the best of his compositional skill. Accordingly, his songs for unaccompanied voice and small chamber pieces are his most popular works. They also comprise the bulk of his musical output. Of his larger works, he completed two symphonies, a violin concerto, and an orchestral suite (In the Alhambra) which are still widely performed today. In 1887, he became Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. In 1892, he married Ruth Block, with whom he had three children. Late years After 1900, Lange- Müller composed very little. He spent most of his time in his secluded home in Sophienberg, entertaining his grandchildren. He died on 26 February 1926, four days after a serious street accident in Copenhagen.

However, pockets of resistance lasted through to 1957, almost 10 years later. It is often called a \\"rebellion incident\\", but it is used as a case of \\"Yeosu and Suncheon incident\\" or \\"Yeosu, Suncheon 10.19 incident\\" since 1995 because the residents of the area may have mistaken it as the main object of the uprising. The rebellion took place in Yeosu, Suncheon, and various surrounding towns in the South Jeolla province of South Korea. Rising anti- government sentiment towards the Syngman Rhee regime ignited in rebellion as 2,000 left-leaning soldiers based in the Yeo-Sun area raised arms in opposition to the Rhee government's handling of the Jeju Uprising, which occurred just months earlier in April. Park Chung-hee, who would later become a president of South Korea, participated in the rebellion, although he was allegedly given leniency in exchange for aiding in the hunt for others involved in the rebellion.  Background and lead-up   Political situation in Korea  After Imperial Japan surrendered to Allied forces on 15 August 1945, the 35-year Japanese occupation of Korea finally came to an end. Korea was subsequently divided at the 38th parallel north, with the Soviet Union assuming trusteeship north of the line and the United States south of the line. In September 1945, Lt. General John R. Hodge established a military government to administer the southern region, which included Jeju Island and the areas in South Jeolla around Yeosu and Suncheon. In December 1945 U.S. representatives met with those from the Soviet Union and United Kingdom to work out joint trusteeship. Due to lack of consensus, however, the U.S. took the “Korean question” to the United Nations for further deliberation. On November 14, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed UN Resolution 112, calling for a general election on May 10, 1948 under UNTCOK supervision. Fearing it would lose influence over the northern half of Korea if it complied, the Soviet Union rejected the UN resolution and denied the UNTCOK access to northern Korea. The UNTCOK nevertheless went through with the elections, albeit in the southern half of the country only. The Soviet Union responded to these elections in the south with an election of its own in the north on August 25, 1948.  Suppression of Jeju Uprising  The Jeju Uprising was an insurgency on the Korean province of Jeju Island which was followed by an anticommunist suppression campaign that lasted from April 3, 1948 until May 1949. The main cause for the protests were the elections scheduled for May 10, 1948, designed by the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea (UNTCOK) to create a new government for all of Korea. The elections, however, were only planned for the south of the country, the half of the peninsula under UNTCOK control. Fearing the elections would further reinforce division, guerrilla fighters of the South Korean Labor Party (SKLP) reacted by fighting local police and rightist youth groups stationed on Jeju Island. Though atrocities were committed by both sides, the methods used by the South Korean government to suppress the rebels were especially cruel. On one occasion, American soldiers discovered the bodies of 97 people including children, killed by government forces. On another, American soldiers caught government police forces carrying out an execution of 76 villagers, including women and children. Massacre of Darangshi Cave in Jeju In the end, between 14,000 and 30,000 people died as a result of the rebellion, or up to 10% of the island’s population. Some 40,000 others fled to Japan to escape the fighting. In the decades after the uprising, memory of the event was suppressed by the government through censorship and repression. In 2006, almost 60 years after the rebellion, the Korean government apologized for its role in the killings. The government also promised reparations but as of 2017, nothing had been done to this end.  Rebellion  The rebellion took place in Yeosu, Suncheon, and various surrounding towns in the South Jeolla province in October–November 1948. The rebellion was led by 2,000 left-leaning soldiers based in the Yeo-Sun area who opposed the Syngman Rhee regime and his government's handling of the Jeju Uprising, which occurred in April. The rebelling soldiers seized weapon caches in the area, taking control of Suncheon. Civilians in support of the rebellion paraded through the streets waving red flags. Police officers as well as public officials and landlords attempting to quell the violence were captured and executed. As the rebellion spread, the number of soldiers participating has been estimated to have reached between 2,000 and 3,000 men. The soldiers captured and massacred right-leaning families as well as Christian youths. After a week, the South Korean Army had suppressed the majority of resistance, in the process killing anywhere from 439 to 2,000 civilians. The South Korean Army was led by US commanders, with military advisors attached to each South Korean Army unit. US aircraft were used to transport troops to suppress the rebellion.  October Events  The Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion (or Incident) began when members of a South Korean military regiment in Yeosu refused to transfer to Jeju Island; they were sympathetic to the leftists and against the Rhee government and the decisive U.S. influence in South Korea. On the night of October 19, 40 soldiers (who were members of the Workers Party of South Korea , a leftist party) of the 14th regiment of Yeosu army took hold of the arsenal in the absence of the regimental commander and vice regimental commander. Hang-soo Ji, chief of the 14th regiment personnel section, asked more than 2000 soldiers to gather at their drill ground and gave an inflammatory speech. Most of the soldiers who were sympathetic to the DPRK cheered to Ji's speech, and those were against Ji were executed on the spot. Those who stood with Ji formed a rebel army, who proceeded to get on different cars to seize the police station of Yeosu and Yeosu Town Hall, killing about 100 police officers, about 500 civilians who supported the Rhee government, as well as some right wing politicians and party members under Rhee's regime. By October 20, the insurgent forces took hold of entire Yeosu and joined the 2nd Company of the 14th Regiment who were stationed in Suncheon County. In the afternoon, Suncheon got occupied by the rebel army. One company belonging to the 4th Regiment of Gwangju army was immediately dispatched to suppress the rebellion, but its commander got killed, and his company was merged into the rebel army. On October 21, Syngman Rhee declared martial law in the Yeosu-Suncheon region, and sent 10 battalions in an attempt to contain the situation. The rebel army then began to attack surrounding areas such as Gwangyang, Gokseong, Boseong and Gurye. On October 22, the rebel army was gradually shifting to Jirisan. On the morning of October 23, Rhee's troops began to attack Suncheon, which was occupied by the rebels. As a result, main forces of the rebel army retreated to Yeosu and mountainous regions in the north. By 11 am, Rhee's troops entered the city area of Suncheon, where there were only defenseless students and civilians left, and proceeded to pursue the insurgent forces in Yeosu. On October 24, pursuing troops of Rhee's army were ambushed by the rebel army. More than 270 soldiers of the troops died, and their commander in chief was also severely injured. Meanwhile, main forces of the rebel army began to transfer to Jirisan in the north. On October 25, Rhee's troops began to attack Yeosu, where they got resisted by more than 200 soldiers of the rebel army, 1000 students and civilians. After two days of street battles, the area was fully suppressed (October 27). A wide-range search for alleged accomplices of the insurgent forces was made by Syngman Rhee as revenge. Those who were suspected of being accomplices of the rebel forces were taken into an elementary school and executed, bodies of thousands of innocent civilians piling up inside the school. For this reason, Rhee's army has been suspected of massacre.  November Events: containment and suppression  The uprising was largely contained by early November, but scattered guerrilla activity continued well into 1957. Even after Yeosu and Suncheon got fully suppressed, Rhee's army still went on to search for accomplices of the rebel forces in the surrounding areas and executed many civilians living around Yeosu and Suncheon, claiming that there were still rebel forces left in both areas.  After the rebellion: fatalities and impact of the incident  During the Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion, between 2,976 and 3,392 people died (depending on the sources), some 82 people went missing, between 1,407 and 2,056 people were injured, 152 soldiers were executed by court martial, and 5,242 homes were destroyed. Rhee learned from this rebellion that the Korean army had been penetrated by members of the South Korean Labor Party, and soon started a full-scale purge of communists: left wing members of the South Korean Labor Party and soldiers who came from the Korean Liberation Army were all expelled from the Korean army. In the meantime, Park Chung-hee, who would later become the president of Korea, was arrested and was sentenced to life at first, but it was alleged that he was punished leniently in exchange for agreeing to hunt down people involved in the rebellion. Moreover, because of the rebellion, Rhee enacted the National Security Law on December 1, 1948. After the rebellion happened, residents in the western part of the country were arbitrarily forced to remain silent about the incident, which was also the case with the Jeju uprising. The matter was recently reviewed by the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which found that government forces killed between 439 and 2,000 area civilians. Brutality was also reported on both sides of the conflict.

Turner played college football for Carson–Newman College, and then professionally for the Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles Rams, Detroit Lions and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFL. He concluded his career with the Frankfurt Galaxy and Scottish Claymores in NFLE. Early life and college career Born in Bedford–Stuyvesant, a neighborhood in the central portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Turner is the oldest of five children, with two brothers and two sisters. Growing up in difficult circumstances, he moved from the slum area in Brooklyn to the quiet neighborhood of Sunnyside on Staten Island while a young child. His mother died when he was a freshman in high school and his stepfather while he was in college. Turner attended Curtis High School on Staten Island where he played football as a quarterback and also lettered in track and field. He earned all- city and all-state honors and left the school with over 4,000 yards passing. In November 2011, Curtis High School inducted him into its Hall of Fame. After graduating from high school, Turner enrolled at Carson–Newman College in Jefferson City, Tennessee, where he was recruited by head coach Ken Sparks to play running back. At the time, the school still was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), earning five Division I national championships during the 1980s. Turner was part of three of those championships when the Eagles won the title in 1986, 1988, and 1989. As a junior in 1988, he led the team in rushing with 1,257 yards on 232 carries, and in scoring with 96 points. During the championship game in December 1988, the running back helped to lead Carson–Newman to a 56–17 victory over Adams State University of Colorado while rushing for 189 yards and three touchdowns. He scored his first six points on an 80-yards run in the game's first play from scrimmage. His performance earned him offensive player of the game honors. Despite concluding his senior campaign only second in rushing yards to teammate Robert Thomas, he was selected to the first team All-South Atlantic Conference in 1989. That year, Turner ran for 869 yards and 12 touchdowns, and also returned 10 kickoffs for 263 yards, including one for 73 yards. He made his last appearance for Carson–Newman during the national championship game on December 16 when the team defeated Emporia State University of Kansas 34–20, marking the Eagles' third title in four years. The New York native finished his collegiate career ranked second in school history with 569 rushing attempts, and fourth with 2,851 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns. Professional career After going unselected in the 1990 NFL Draft, Turner signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos. Turner was released during the Broncos final cut. A week after getting released by the Broncos, Turner was signed to the Buffalo Bills practice squad. Vernon was a part of Super Bowl 25 (Bills vs Giants). The following year, Vernon was again released by the Bills during the final roster cuts. Within 2 hours, Turner was picked up by the LA Rams. Turner led the Rams in Kick-off and punt returns for 2 years. Turner was released by the Rams at the end of the 1992 season. He signed a free agent contract with the Detroit Lions where he backed up Legendary return specialist, Mel Gray.

Turner was their leading return specialist during the 1994 season. Vernon went into the Bucs history books by becoming the first player to ever return a kick or punt for a touchdown in the franchise history.

A road block near Le Gosier, Guadeloupe, during the strikes. The 2009 French Caribbean general strikes began in the French overseas region of Guadeloupe on 20 January 2009, and spread to neighbouring Martinique on 5 February 2009. Both islands are located in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean. The general strikes began over the cost of living, the prices of basic commodities, including fuel and food, and demands for an increase in the monthly salaries of low income workers. Stores and gas stations in the private sector, and public sector services including education, public transportation, and sanitation, were temporarily closed in Guadeloupe and Martinique due to the strikes. The strikes ended when the French government agreed to raise the salaries of the lowest paid by €200 and acceded to the strikers' top 20 demands. The strikes exposed deep ethnic, racial, and class tensions and disparities within Guadeloupe and Martinique and devastated the tourism industry of both islands during the high season. The islands were believed to have lost millions of dollars in tourism revenue due to cancelled vacations and closed hotels. Guadeloupe and Martinique had the second and third highest unemployment rates in the European Union as of 2007, according to Eurostat.  Background of the strikes  Guadeloupe's location within the Caribbean region. Residents of Guadeloupe and Martinique, whose economies are dependent on tourism, have a very high cost of living. Many residents feel their salaries are not keeping up with the rising cost of food, utilities and other necessities. The prices of basic commodities and food staples are much higher in Guadeloupe and Martinique than in metropolitan France. These high prices are due to the higher costs of importing products into the islands. The average salary in Guadeloupe, the cause of the first general strike, is lower than in mainland France while the unemployment and poverty rates on both islands are double those found in metropolitan France. Both islands are supported by subsidies from the French government. Four French overseas territories had the highest unemployment rates in the European Union in 2007 – Réunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana. Guadeloupe also has the highest youth unemployment rate in the European Union, with 55.7% in the 15-to-24-years age group unemployed.  Race  The market in Pointe- à-Pitre. The structure of the economy of the French Caribbean, a legacy of the colonial era, complicated the 2009 crisis. Most of Guadeloupe's and Martinique's largest land and business assets are controlled by the \\"békés\\", the white European descendants of the islands' settlers. The békés' ancestors had been the islands' colonists and slave holders. The majority of the Guadeloupean and Martiniquean populations, who are of Black African or mixed race descent, live in relative poverty (to the békés). For example, the békés of Martinique comprise 1%Béatrice Gurrey et Benoît Hopquin, Békés : Une affaire d'héritage, in Le Monde, 28 février 2009], article en ligne of the island's 401,000 population, and control most of the island's industries. The residents of both Guadeloupe and Martinique are considered to be full French citizens. The Euro is the official currency on both islands. The government and day-to-day decisions affecting both islands are made in Paris, located thousands of miles away. Working families, especially lower-income families, have complained that it is difficult to pay for basic necessities due to the high cost of living. 70% of residents in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe's largest city, currently reside in public housing. The islands are also afflicted by a number of other societal problems. The homicide rate in Guadeloupe is four times higher than that of mainland France. Protesters in Guadeloupe and Martinique accused the French government of ignoring their economic and political concerns in the face of the looming global financial crisis of 2008–2009.  Guadeloupe  A map of Guadeloupe. The protests initially began in Guadeloupe on 20 January 2009. An umbrella group of approximately fifty labour union and other associations known in the local Antillean Creole as the Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon (LKP) called for a €200 (US$260) monthly pay increase for the island's low income workers. The protesters proposed that authorities \\"lower business taxes as a top up to company finances\\" to pay for the €200 pay raises. Employers and business leaders in Guadeloupe said that they could not afford the salary increase. Approximately 50,000 Guadeloupeans were reported to have taken part in the demonstrations. The Liyannaj Kont Pwofitasyon (LKP), which launched the protests, is also known as the \\"Stand up against exploitation\\" in English or the \\"Collectif contre l'exploitation outrancière\\" in French. The government of France sent the Junior Minister of Overseas France Yves Jégo to Guadeloupe to negotiate with disgruntled employees and protesters. He proposed a deal to increase the salaries of 45,000 Guadeloupean workers by about $300. Jégo triggered much criticism among Guadeloupean strikers when he suddenly returned to Paris on Monday 9 February for a crisis meeting with French Prime Minister François Fillon. Jégo's departure for the meeting in Paris with Prime Minister Fillon and other ministers was denounced by union leaders as a sign of \\"contempt\\" for LKP and their supporters during a time of crisis. Demonstrations erupted across Guadeloupe in response to Jégo's trip to France. More than 10,000 people marched in Pointe-à-Pitre, the largest city in Guadeloupe, while an additional 1,500 protesters gathered in Basse-Terre, the capital city. Protesters chanted, \\"la Gwadloup se tan nou, la Gwadloup a pa ta yo, yo peke fe sa yo vle an peyi an nou\\", which translates to \\"Guadeloupe is ours, it is not theirs, they will not do what they want in our country.\\" Demonstrators forced the closure of local stores and businesses in those cities. However, the stores reopened as soon as the protesters passed by. Jégo returned to Guadeloupe (and Martinique) later in the week. Guadeloupean protesters remained angered by his perceived slight. A leader of the LKP, Élie Domota, told France Inter radio that, \\"The mediators have nothing new to tell us. They came supposedly to bring the parties closer together but they know nothing about the situation here. We are saying that the state has to help small Guadeloupe businesses to develop, to have access to bank credits, and also to pay for our wage increases.\\" Jégo's original proposal, which would have increased the salaries of at least 45,000 workers by nearly US$300 per month, quickly fell apart. The unions demanded that the government alleviate extra cost by slashing payroll taxes. The French government flatly rejected the idea of cutting payroll taxes. The LKP thus suspended negotiations with mediators on Thursday 12 February 2009. George Pau-Langevin, a French Socialist MP who was born in Guadeloupe but represents a portion of Paris, said that Guadeloupeans were not just protesting low incomes, but also \\"the indecent profits of big fuel and import-export companies.\\" Guadeloupean deputy Victorin Lurel denounced the high price of fuel on the island as a \\"scandal.\\" The main shipping container terminal at the port in Pointe-à-Pitre was closed and barricaded by protesters. Most Guadeloupean banks, schools, and government offices remained closed throughout the duration of the strike. All of Guadeloupe's 115 gas stations were closed in response to the strike. The strikes resulted in sporadic power outages and limited running water as utility workers walked off their jobs to join the protests. Supermarkets remained closed, and food imports were halted. The strikes hit at the height of Guadeloupe's main tourism season. Guadeloupe depends on tourists, especially from France, for a significant portion of its economic income. Several hotels closed temporarily and charter flights from France and other parts of the Caribbean were canceled. Club Méditerranée, known more widely as Club Med, closed its main hotel on Guadeloupe in late January. Thousands of French tourists canceled their vacations to Guadeloupe as a result of the strike.  Escalation  A road block on the RN4, near Le Gosier. After four weeks, the general strike on Guadeloupe escalated into rioting on Monday, 16 February 2009. Protesters clashed in several municipalities across the island, including the largest city, Pointe-à-Pitre, and the northern town of Sainte-Rose. Guadeloupe's main airport, Pointe-à-Pitre International Airport, was closed because debris was thrown on the runway, causing American Airlines to cancel all flights. Cars and trees were set on fire in the centre of Pointe-à-Pitre. A group of about sixty protesters clashed with two squadrons of police, who responded by firing tear gas. Police arrested approximately fifty people after protesters threw stones at them as the police tried to remove makeshift barricades in Pointe-à- Pitre. Most of those who were detained were later released after large crowds gathered outside the city's main police station. Protesters wearing hooded sweatshirts burned pallets and trashcans to block roads around the southern town of Le Gosier. Victorin Lurel, the Socialist leader of the Regional Council of Guadeloupe, described the situation on Guadeloupe as \\"on the verge of revolt.\\" French Interior Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie called for \\"calm, responsibility and restraint.\\" Armed \\"youths\\" manning a makeshift roadblock shot and killed a local union representative in the city of Pointe-à-Pitre just after midnight on Wednesday, 18 February 2009. The victim, Jacques Bino, a 50-year-old tax agent and union member who was returning home from protests elsewhere, was the first person killed during the strike. Bino's car was hit three times by 12-gauge Brenneke-style shotgun slugs. Several police officers were also injured in the overnight violence. Unions leading the strikes called for a deescalation of violence on the island. Elie Domota, a leader of the LKP, told protesters, \\"Don't put your life in danger – don't endanger the lives of others.\\" A closed gas station near Le Gosier, after a night of violence. The situation across the island continued to deteriorate throughout the day on Wednesday, 18 February. The mayor of Pointe-à-Pitre, Jacques Bangou, reported that three policemen were wounded by gunfire in the Cite Henri IV section of the city. Police fired tear gas to break up rioters, but Mayor Bangou told the AFP that there were still \\"exchanges of gunfire\\" in the neighborhood. A correspondent for AFP reported hearing more \\"blasts\\" in the city just before 0400 GMT on Wednesday. Elsewhere, looters attacked a shopping center and ransacked a perfumery and a tire store. A number of police officers were also injured when a group of up to 100 youths \\"rampaged\\" though the commercial district of Destrelland in the town of Baie-Mahault and fired guns at police, according to Baie-Mahault's mayor, Ary Chalus. More than 500 French police officers arrived in Guadeloupe on 19 February in an attempt to quell the ongoing violence following Bino's death. The deployment occurred after a third straight night of violence. Dozens of police officers landed in the southern town of Sainte-Anne, Guadeloupe, where protesting youths stormed and occupied the town's city hall. Sainte-Anne Mayor Richard Yacou said that the city hall was not damaged, but nearby businesses in the town were looted and burned. Rioters also fired weapons at police and burned at least five stores and restaurants in Le Gosier. Police dismantled the barricades leading to the main airport, which allowed tourists to leave the island.  Negotiations resume  Victorin Lurel, the president of Guadeloupe's regional council, demanded that the French government stop the violence and address underlying tensions. In response to the riots, President Nicolas Sarkozy announced a meeting of the elected leaders of the French overseas territories \\"to respond to the anxiety, the worry and a certain form of despair of our compatriots overseas.\\" On 19 February, it was reported that the French government had offered to increase low earners' income by almost €200, in line with unions' demands. Negotiations between the government and the LKP were suspended on Friday, 25 February, partially in response to the funeral of Jacques Bino over the weekend. Talks resumed the following Monday. Representatives of the LKP met with French officials and business leaders in the city of Pointe-à-Pitre. Outside hundreds of demonstrators gathered, chanting, \\"We're here to negotiate\\" and \\"Guadeloupe belongs to us, it's not theirs.\\"  Martinique  A map of Martinique. The strike spread to neighbouring Martinique beginning on 5 February 2009. Protesters paralysed Martinique's capital city, Fort-de-France. An estimated 11,000 people had taken part in the demonstrations on Martinique in the first seven days of the strike, according to the local police. Martiniquean unions disagreed with the estimates, arguing that the protesters had numbered at least 25,000 individuals. Demonstrators carried pro-trade union signs and wore red shirts, representing the official color of the local unions. Protesters in Martinique demanded a monthly salary increase of nearly US$580 for all workers earning minimum wage on the island. They also called for a reduction in monthly electricity and water bills for Martinique residents. Government and transportation leaders reportedly agreed to reduce freight costs. In response, business leaders on Martinique agreed to lower the prices of 100 basic products, including food, by 20%. Martiniquean residents were reportedly shopping only at small, family-run grocery stores, as most large stores remained closed during the protests. Demonstrators were reported to have stormed most major chain supermarkets and forced them to close. Gas stations, which were closed in response to the strike, were serving only medical and emergency workers. Colonel François-Xavier Bourges, the police chief of Martinique, said that ten people had been arrested for stealing gasoline or looting. France deployed 130 riot police from mainland France to Martinique on 12 February 2009, to \\"ensure that order is maintained.\\" The tourism industry on Martinique grew increasingly impatient with the strikers and the lack of basic services. Benoit Le Cesne, the president of Martinique's hotel association, expressed concern over the potential negative effects on the tourism industry, \\"There are basically no more supplies, neither of gas nor food, and laundry services are no longer operating. If this continues, professionals will no longer be able to guarantee services promised to tourists.\\" Unlike in Guadeloupe, the Club Med Buccaneer's Creek resort in Martinique remained open through the strike. On Monday, 16 February, protesters allowed 28 of Martinique's 85 gas stations to reopen and be resupplied. Residents and tourists lined up for hours to fill their cars' gas tanks. All small businesses who had reopened over the weekend were forced to close again. Protesters also blocked industrial areas of the island and the city centre in Fort-de-France. On Thursday, 20 February 2009, Fort-de-France Mayor Serge Letchimy announced the cancellation of Martinique's annual four- day Carnival, citing the ongoing general strike and the death of union activist Jacques Bino on neighboring Guadeloupe. Martinican police had criticized Letchimy's decision to hold the Carnival, saying that they did not have enough time to prepare due to the strike. The Carnival would have begun on 22 February. The annual carnival usually attracts 50,000 people to Fort-de- France. It was the first time in history that the festival had been cancelled.  Martiniquan racial tensions  The protests in Martinique began to take on racial and class undertones due to the economic stresses. The békés, descendants of French European settlers, continue to hold most of the island's industrial capacity. Racial tensions rose during the first week of February after an hour long documentary, entitled The last masters of Martinique (Les derniers maîtres de la Martinique in French), was broadcast on a French television channel. The premise of the documentary was that the ethnically white French community had continued to dominate Martinique's economy throughout its history. Tensions were especially inflamed when a French businessman, Alain Huygues-Despointes, was quoted as saying that historians should explore \\"the positive aspects of slavery\\" and that Martinique's mixed- race families lacked \\"harmony.\\" Following those statements, Martinique's Prefect Ange Mancini, who had been renting a home from Huygues-Despointes, announced that he had terminated a lease agreement with Huygues-Despointes and had moved to a new residence. The French government announced that it would open a criminal investigation into Huygues-Despointes following his controversial remarks. On Friday 13 February 2009, approximately 2,000 protesters marched while chanting slogans against Martinique's béké minority. The marchers, who were predominantly of the African majority descent, chanted, \\"Martinique is ours, not theirs!\\"  French government reaction  French President Nicolas Sarkozy did not mention those events in his one-hour-and-a- half television talk of 5 February 2009. He acknowledged later the grievances of the strikers in his first remarks on the crisis, \\"There cannot be a two- speed society in which one part gets richer while the other stagnates and depends on benefits.\\" Sarkozy ordered the government on 13 February 2009, to begin a review of France's policies towards its overseas territories. Sarkozy simultaneously announced the creation of a new government council to review policy toward all French overseas territories, a promise he had made during the presidential campaign of 2007. He called for a \\"distribution des richesses\\" (i.e. distribution of wealth) to alleviate the societal and economic ills afflicting Guadeloupe and Martinique. French government ministers were asked to propose new long-term measures intended to modernise and stimulate the economies of both islands. Sarkozy suggested that the government may open up the islands' economies to more economic competition, but did not appear to strongly support the wage increases demanded by protesters, saying \\"We should beware of false good ideas for a short-term end to the conflict.\\" Sarkozy sought to reassure residents that the government was not ignoring their concerns, saying \\"Guadeloupe and Martinique are part of France\\" and that the islands' residents \\"have the sentiment that they are not always heard. We should continue to fight, every day, so that the country makes a larger place for those who represent the diversity of France.\\" Ending the strikes: the Jacques Bino Accord The strikes ended on 4 March 2009, when the French government agreed to raise the salaries of the lowest paid by €200 and granted the LKP their top 20 demands. The agreement was named the \\"Jacques Bino Accord\\" to commemorate the union activist killed during the strike. According to the Australian Green Left Weekly, 30,000 people marched through the streets of Pointe-à-Pitre on 7 March to celebrate the victory. French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited Martinique and Guadeloupe in June 2009, as part of an effort to heal the rifts caused by the strikes.Sarkozy offers autonomy vote for Martinique, Agence France-Presse While ruling out full independence, which he said was desired neither by France nor by Martinique, Sarkozy offered Martiniquans a referendum on the island's future status and degree of autonomy. During his visit to Guadeloupe, Sarkozy likewise asserted that \\"Guadeloupe is French, and will remain French.\\"Nicolas Sarkozy achève sa visite en Guadeloupe, Le Nouvel Observateur LKP representatives refused to meet him.French President pays visit to Caribbean French islands, Dominica News Online LKP calls for anti-Sarkozy demonstrations met with little response, with no more than 1,000 people attending.  Other French protests  A coalition of labour unions in Réunion, a French overseas region in the Indian Ocean located thousands of miles from Guadeloupe and Martinique, announced their own general strike scheduled for 5 March 2009, in support of the Caribbean strikes. An alliance of unions in French Guiana, which is located in South America, also threatened to strike, saying their workers suffered the same low wages and low quality of life as those in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Martine Aubry, the leader of the French Socialist Party, warned of the risk that the protests could spread further to mainland France in an interview with Le Parisien. Following the settlement ending the strikes, trade unions in the French mainland were reported to \\"have rejected the idea of trying to bring about in mainland France what has happened in Guadeloupe\\". Far-left leader Olivier Besancenot, however, was happy to cite the strikes in Guadeloupe as an inspiration and \\"an example to reflect on and follow\\".

Conceived by then-Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, the book was in the form of a contest encouraging up-and-coming comics creators to try their hand at getting a job with the company. The winner would be awarded a professional assignment with Marvel. The book described the respective jobs and accompanying tools of a writer, penciller, inker, letterer, and colorist, and then provided pages ready for the hopeful cartoonist to work on. An unfinished Spider-Man story (titled \\"Personals\\") was the springboard for the try-out portion, which among other features contained blank, pre-ruled pages for pencilers, pre-penciled \\"non-photo blue\\" pages (by artist John Romita, Jr.) to be inked and lettered, and completed black-and- white pages to be colored. The entire book was printed on two-ply 11\\" × 17\\" paper, replicating the size that a typical comic book was drawn on.  Publication history  Though the book was published in 1983, the contest winners were not announced until 1986.Shooter, Jim. \\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel Comics cover-dated Feb. 1986. The initial winners were: * Plotter and scripter: Chuck Duffie * Penciller: Mark Bagley * Inker: Doug Hazlewood * Colorist: P. Jeanine Pasda * Letterer: Robin Riggs For their outstanding entries, the winners received a commemorative certificate. They were also promised \\"their first regular professional assignment, which will be finishing the Spider-Man story 'Personals' which was begun in the Try-Out Book. The result of their labors will be published next spring in a special giant-sized issue of The Amazing Spider-Man.\\" That promised issue never was published. However, artist Bagley is now a well-known penciller who would go on to have an extended run on Amazing Spider-Man in the 1990s and then Ultimate Spider- Man with Brian Michael Bendis in the 2000s. Inker Hazlewood has had a steady career, mostly for DC Comics, since the late 1980s. Duffie and Pasda have yet to see their work in print.  1996 edition  In 1996 a new edition of The Marvel Try-Out Book was released, edited by Marvel Submissions Editor John Lewandowski and featuring an introduction by Bagley. The New Official Marvel Try-Out Book #2 maintains the same overall format as the original, but features an X-Men story drawn by Andy Kubert. In addition, the new version takes into account advances in computer technology in the production of comics. Other changes include fewer pencilled pages to ink over than in the original book, which are printed in black ink rather than \\"non-photo blue.\\" (This means inkers must use tracing paper rather than being able to ink directly on the art.)

According to The New York Times, “Mark Dubowitz’s campaign to draw attention to what he saw as the flaws in the Iran nuclear deal has taken its place among the most consequential ever undertaken by a Washington think tank leader.” He was a leading critic of the Iran nuclear agreement, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but then tried to save it after President Trump withdrew from the agreement according to his own account. Early life and education Dubowitz is a citizen of the United States. He was born in South Africa and raised in Toronto. Dubowitz earned a master's degree in international public policy from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where he focused on China. He also earned a Juris Doctor and Master of Business Administration from the University of Toronto. He has also studied at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.

As a vocal critic of the agreement, Dubowitz has stated that it did not address Iran's non-nuclear malign activity, such as its misappropriation of economic relief to fund terrorism, and \\"its lack of any limits on the regime’s ballistic missile program and its 'sunset provisions' that would allow Iran to increase its capacity to enrich uranium beginning seven years from now.\\" According to Politico, although Dubowitz \\"was an intense critic of the Iran deal,\\" he \\"nonetheless advocated against scrapping it.\\" He told Ynet in 2011 that at FDD they \\"closely monitor international companies that do business with Iran, invest in Iran's energy sector and provide important equipment and technologies to this sector. They also monitor the movement of commercial vessels coming into and leaving Iran.

He taught as Professor of Educational History in the Universities of La Plata, El Comahue and La Pampa and authored his first book, Education and Society in Argentina, 1800-1945, in 1972. Tedesco was appointed as an education policy specialist in 1976 for UNESCO's Latin American Development and Education Project. He became Director of UNESCO's Regional Center for Latin American Higher Education in Caracas between 1982 and 1986 and of their Regional Education Center in Santiago between 1986 and 1992. Repression suffered by Argentine educators and students during its last dictatorship led Tedesco to co-author a criticism of the problem, The Authoritarian Educational Agenda, with Cecilia Braslavsky in 1983. The experience earned him the post of Director of the IBE in Geneva, a position he held until 1997, and as head of the Buenos Aires UNESCO bureau, until 2004. Tedesco returned to Academia, dividing his time between the private Universidad de San Andrés and the public National University of Tres de Febrero, both outside Buenos Aires.

History Leiblin Park was conceived by William J. Olie in the early 1950s. The land was an inheritance of his wife, Elizabeth (Pearl) Kidston. The subdivision takes its name from a farm owned by Henry Leiblin, in the area of what is now Elmdale Crescent. The tract of land was about 3 km long, but narrow, bordered by the watershed of Long Lake (at the time the water supply of the city of Halifax) on its east side. Olie planned to create one long street, to be called Leiblin Drive, with crescents looping off it to the west. Each crescent would contain 16 single-family dwellings. The crescents are named in alphabetical order, with tree or plant names predominating. The first crescent, Avon, was built in 1956, and the homes sold quickly, for around $8,000 each. The city of Halifax (at that time the peninsula) was overcrowded, and new housing was much in demand. The capital raised from Avon allowed Olie to leverage financing for the rest of the project, and construction re- commenced in 1958. In the area of Devon and Elmdale Crescents the Drive ran into the flank of a large drumlin. The material excavated from the drumlin was used to fill the side of a peat bog to the southwest. Due to the bog, there is no \\"F\\" crescent. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a commercial building just past Elmsdale, with offices, two apartments, and a corner store, first operated by Elizabeth Olie. The building has since been demolished. The bog was gradually filled with construction and demolition waste in the 1970s and 1980s to create the Graves-Oakley Memorial Park. Beyond the bog, four more crescents were built, plus Kenwood Avenue and Linden Lane. At this point the project was running up against the Old Sambro Road, as well as large granite outcroppings on Linden Lane. The plan was to continue the project across the Old Sambro Road, and the land was cleared of the larger trees, but in 1963 Olie Construction Ltd. was forced to declare bankruptcy. Since that time, additional homes have been added to most of the crescents, and Nita Lane has been built near Linden Lane.

She sailed on a barkantine schooner from Singapore to Ceylon, then from Beirut to Malta. It was on the schooner where she met geologist, Yvor Hyatt Smitter, the son of Faith (née Winters) and Wessel Smitter (author, F.O.B. Detroit). S.J.

The moderately received play comically depicts three lovers trying to pursue their individual beloveds. The beloveds require their lovers to meet their various demands, which serves as a means for Fielding to introduce his personal feelings on morality and virtue. In addition, Fielding introduces criticism of women and society in general. The play marks Fielding's early approach to theatre and how he begins to create his own take on tradition 18th-century theatre conventions. Critics have emphasised little beyond how the play serves as Fielding's first play among many. The possible sources of the play including a possible failed pursuit of a lover by Fielding, or the beginnings of Fielding's reliance on the topic of gender, identity, and social ethics. Background Henry Fielding Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play. It was advertised on 15 January 1728 in the London Evening Post and first ran on 16 February 1728 at the Theatre Royal. Performances were held on 17, 19 and 20 February, with the third night being the author's benefit. The play was never revived.Fielding 2004 p. 9 The cast included four members among some of the most talented of the Theatre Royal actors. Although it only ran for four nights, this was a great feat because John Gay's popular The Beggar's Opera was performed during the same time and dominated the theatrical community during its run.Rivero 1989 pp. 6–7 It was first printed on 23 February 1728 by John Watts, and a Dublin edition appeared in 1728. The play was later collected by John Watts in the 1742 and 1745 Dramatick Works and by Andrew Millar in the 1755 edition of Fielding's works. It was later translated and printed in German as Lieb unter verschiedenen Larven in 1759.Fielding 2004 pp. 10–14 Most of the information on the play and its run is known because of Fielding's preface in the printed edition of the play. The printed Love in Several Masques is dedicated \\"To the Right Honourable the Lady Mary Wortley Montague\\", his cousin. It is probable that she read the original draft of the play, which is alluded to in the dedication.Hume 1988 pp. 29–30 Information on her reading the draft comes from a letter written in approximately September 1727.Battesin 1989 pp. 246–248 In the letter, Fielding writes: The play was completed during September 1727 and it was listed in the British Journal of 23 September 1727 as being scheduled. There is little information on Fielding's editing of the work, and none to support that anyone suggested corrections except Anne Oldfield, who he thanked in the Preface for supplying corrections. The prologue, dedication, and preface were probably composed during January or February 1728, with the dedication and preface most likely composed between the last nights of the show, 20 and 21 February, and its publication, 23 February.Fielding 2004 pp. 2–4 Cast The cast according to the original printed billing:Hume 1988 pp. 32–33Fielding 2004 p. 24 * Wisemore – lover of Lady Matchless, played by John Mills * Merital – lover of Helena, played by Robert Wilks * Malvil – lover of Vermilia, played by Roger Bridgewater * Lord Formal – rival to Wisemore, played by Benjamin Griffin * Rattle – fop and rival to Merital, played by Colley Cibber * Sir Apish Simple – rival to Malvil, played by Josias Miller * Lady Matchless – played by Anne Oldfield * Vermilia – played by Mary Porter * Helena – played by Mrs Booth * Sir Positive Trap – husband of Lady Trap, care taker of Helena, played by John Harper * Lady Trap – played by Mrs. Moor * Catchit – maid to Lady Trap, played by Theodosia Mills * Prologue spoken by John MillsFielding 2004 p. 25 * Epilogue spoken by Miss Robinson, child actressFielding 2004 p. 97 Plot The plot is traditional in regards to Restoration theatre and includes three female characters, three respectable males, three non-respectable males, and three side characters. Each respectable male meets their female counterpart three times, and each has a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. The primary plot of the play deals with Wisemore and his pursuit of Lady Matchless.Rivero 1989 p. 17 With the help of his friend Merital, Wisemore is able to overcome other lovers and various struggles in order to prove his worth to Matchless and win her love.Fielding 2004 pp. 85–91 A secondary plot involves Merital and his desire to marry a woman named Helena, cousin to Matchless. He is kept from doing so externally by her uncle, Sir Positive Trap, by the workings of her aunt, and internally by themselves.Rivero 1989 pp. 17–18 Against her uncle's wishes, Helena and Merital elope. Although Trap is angered by this, Lady Matchless steps in and defends the marriage by saying that she too will marry like her cousin. The play ends with a song about beauty, virtue, and lovers.Fielding 2004 pp. 91–95 Preface The printed version of the play included a self- conscious preface:Rivero 1989 p. 7 > I believe few plays have ever adventured into the world under greater > disadvantage than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the > continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) > applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And secondly, as it > is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk and > admiration of the town. These were difficulties which seemed rather to > require the superior force of a Wycherley, or a Congreve, than of a raw and > unexperienced pen; for I believe I may boast that none ever appeared so > early upon the stage. However, such was the candour of the audience, the > play was received with greater satisfaction than I should have promised > myself from its merit, had it even preceded the Provoked Husband.Fielding > 1902 Vol VIII p. 9 He continued by thanking his cast, especially Anne Oldfield, for the effort that they put into their roles.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 60–61 This preface served as a model for Fielding's later prefaces included in his novels, such as Joseph Andrews or Tom Jones. Themes Love in Several Masques is a traditional comic drama that incorporates morality. The theme of the play is the relationship of disguises and courtship with a discussion of the nature of love. Fielding focuses on men and how they deal with love and marriage. Also, the gentlemen must prove their worth before they can be justified in their marriage, which allows Fielding to describe the traits required in successful male suitors. The first act deals primarily with the gentlemen in order to establish a focus on their characteristics.Rivero 1989 pp. 16–17 Fielding's first play serves as a representation for his belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that he would use throughout his plays and novels.Potter 1999 p. 34 However, all negative characteristics are very apparent to the audience, and those characters who are immoral are unable to accomplish their goals. The main characters are still decent individuals who are able to help another, even though they sometimes get in each other's way. At no time is the audience able to believe that vice will conquer, which undermines part of the satire. Regardless, Harold Pagliaro is still able to conclude that \\"Fielding's satire on the marriage market, however, is effective, if not biting.\\"Pagliaro 1998 pp. 58–59 Wisemore's character introduces feelings about the London community and criticises various problems. However, his reflections are portrayed as both correct and lacking, and that he is focused only on the bad aspects of life. His ideas result from removing himself from society in preference to the company of classical books. Although he does not realise it, the play suggests that there are virtuous people. Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish. As the play later reveals, Wisemore's views are only a mask to hide from his own feelings and views on love.Rivero 1989 pp. 19–20 Wisemore is not the only one to serve as a means to comment on society; the characters Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This is not to suggest that Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power.Campbell 1995 pp. 23–24 Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and \\"Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them.\\"Potter 1999 p. 38 The image of the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social acceptability of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles that they do not fill.Campbell 1995 pp. 49–50 Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.Potter 1999 pp. 36–37 Sources Sarah Andrew It is possible that the plot of Love in Several Masques is connected to Fielding's own attempt to marry Sarah Andrew in November 1725.Cross 1918 pp. 53–55 Fielding met Andrew when he travelled to Lyme Regis. She was his cousin by marriage, 15 years old, and an heiress of the fortune of her father, Solomon Andrew. Her guardian Andrew Tucker, her uncle, prohibited Fielding from romantically pursuing her; it is possible that Tucker wished Andrew to marry his own son. On 14 November 1725, Andrew Tucker alleged the mayor that Fielding and Fielding's servant, Joseph Lewis, threatened to harm Tucker. According to Andrews's descendants, Fielding attempted to violently take Andrew on 14 November.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 49–50 Regardless, Fielding fled the town after leaving a notice in public view that accused Andrew Tucker and his son of being \\"Clowns, and Cowards\\".Battestin and Battestin 1993 qtd. p. 51 Thomas Lockwood qualified the connection of this incident and the plot of Love in Several Masques by saying, \\"I suspect so too, or at any rate suspect that this experience gave a crucial infusion of real feeling to that part of the play: which is however not to say that the writing itself, or the idea, goes back that far.\\"Fielding 2004 p. 2 The style of Love in Several Masques, along with The Temple Beau (1730), exemplified Fielding's understanding of traditional Post-Restoration comedic form.Rivero 1989 p. 3 Albert Rivero, a critic specialising in early 18th- century literature, believes that Fielding, in the play, \\"recognizes that to have his plays acted at Drury Lane, he must have the approval of his famous contemporary [Colley Cibber]. To gain that approval, Fielding must follow Cibber—if not write like him, certainly write plays that he will like.\\"Rivero 1989 p. 9 However, Fielding did not respect Cibber's abilities, nor did he believe that the control Cibber took over the plays performed at the Theatre Royal were improved by Cibber's required changes. Instead, Fielding believed that Cibber got in the way of comedy.Rivero 1989 p. 10 Regardless, there are similarities between the characters in Love in Several Masques and Cibber and Vanbrugh's The Provoked Husband. In particular, Fielding's Lady Matchless resembles the character Lady Townly.Fielding 2004 p. 5 The play was traditionally believed by critics to be modelled after the plays of Congreve, with those in the eighteenth century, like Arthur Murphy, to those in the twentieth century, like Wilbur Cross, arguing in support of a connection. Love in Several Masques resembles Congreve's use of plot and dialogue. In particular, Merital and Malvil resemble characters in The Old Batchelor and Rattle resembles the fop in Love for Love. However, parts of Love in Several Masque also resembles Molière's Les Femmes Savantes, Sganarelle and Le Misanthrope. There are also possible connections between the play and Farquhar's The Constant Couple and Etherege's She wou'd if she Cou'd.Fielding 2004 pp. 3–5 Of all the influences, theatre historian Robert Hume points out that Fielding's \\"play is humane comedy, not satire, and his generic affinities are closer to Centlivre and Cibber than to Congreve\\" and that \\"His first play is an imitative exercise in a popular form, not an attempt to write a Congrevean throw-back\\"; Hume offers that Love in Several Masques has connections to Christopher Bullock's Woman Is a Riddle (1716), Susanna Centlivre's The Busie Body (1709), Cibber's Double Gallant (1707), Farquhar's The Constant Couple (1699), Richard Steele's The Funeral (1701), John Vanbrugh's The Confederacy (1705) and The Mistake (1705) and Leonard Welsted's The Dissembled Wanton (1726).Hume 1988 p. 31 Critical response Love in Several Masques was \\"neither a success nor a fiasco\\", and Fielding writes in the preface, \\"the Play was received with greater Satisfaction than I should have promised myself from its Merit\\".Hume 1988 qtd. p. 33 The play was later quoted in The Beauties of Fielding more than any of Fielding's other plays, according to Thomas Lockwood, \\"because for anthology reading purposes it supplied far more extractably witty bits than other Fielding plays more representative or still holding the stage.\\"Fielding 2004 p. 10 Eighteenth and nineteenth century critics did little to discuss the play. David Erskine Baker simply lists the play in Companion to the Playhouse (1764), Charles Dibdin's History of the Stage (1800) makes a short comment on the dialogue, and John Genest said that the play was \\"moderate\\" in Some Account of the English Stage (1832).Fielding 2004 pp. 10–11 A page is devoted to Love in Several Masques in Edwin Percy Whipple's review of a collection of Fielding's works, which calls the play \\"a well-written imitation\\" that has \\"smart and glib rather than witty\\" dialogue even though it contains \\"affected similes and ingenious comparisons, which the author forces into his dialogue to make it seem brilliant.\\"Whipple 1849 pp. 47–48 Frederick Lawrence, in his Life of Henry Fielding (1855), connected the play with those of Congreve and enjoyed some of the dialogue.Fielding 2004 p. 11 Twentieth century critics tend to range in opinions on the play. F. Homes Dudden argues that \\"The dialogue is smart; the plot, though insufficiently compact, is fairly ingenious; the characters [...] are conventional comic types [...] It deserved what in fact it achieved—a qualified success.\\"Dudden 1966 p. 22 Robert Hume believes that \\"The play is not, in truth, very good\\", that \\"Fielding offers three minimally intertwined love plots\\", and that the narrative is \\"clumsy\\".Hume 1988 p. 30 However, Rivero believes that this characterisation is \\"unjust\\" and that the play deserves more merit. The play, as Rivero argues, \\"evinces what critics have identified as the quintessence of Fielding's art: its clear moral purpose, its conspicuous moral tone.\\"Rivero 1989 pp. 16–18 Thomas Lockwood argues that the play \\"has been noticed mainly as it was Fielding's first play, or else as the example of that imitation of Congrevean form which supposedly marked his beginning in dramatic authorship. Beyond these impressions of the play, there is no real tradition of critical discussion.\\"Fielding 2004 p. 12 Pagliaro, one of Fielding's biographers, simply states that \\"By the standards of the day, the play neither failed nor succeeded, running four nights as it did.\\"Pagliaro 1998 p. 51 Notes References * Battestin, Martin. \\"Dating Fielding's Letters to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu\\" Studies in Bibliography 42 (1989). * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

Aestivation is also sometimes referred to as praefoliation or prefoliation, but these terms may also mean vernation: the arrangement of leaves within a vegetative bud.

Women have served in Australian armed forces since 1899. Until World War II women were restricted to the Australian Army Nursing Service. This role expanded in 1941-42 when the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force established female branches in which women took on a range of support roles. While these organisations were disbanded at the end of the war, they were reestablished in 1950 as part of the military's permanent structure. Women were integrated into the services during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but were not allowed to apply for combat roles until 2013. Women can now serve in all positions in the Australian Defence Force (ADF), including the special forces. Current female participation rates The ADF has an overall female participation rate of 17.9%. This has grown steadily since 2011, when Defence made increasing female participation a priority, with the intent of opening all previously gender restricted roles to women. Since 2012-13 defence has produced an annual ‘Women in the ADF’ report to assess their progress, as “increasing the participation of women in the ADF ensures that Defence secures the best possible talent available”. The percentage of women in each service as of the 2017-18 report is 21.5% in the Navy, 14.3% in the Army, and 22.1% in the Air Force. History Separate branches Female service in the Australian military began in 1899 when the Australian Army Nursing Service was formed as part of the New South Wales colonial military forces. Army nurses formed part of the Australian contribution to the Boer War, and their success led to the formation of the Australian Army Nursing Reserve in 1902. The role of Australian women in World War I was focused mainly upon their involvement in the provision of nursing services. More than 2000 members of the Australian Army Nursing Service (AANS) served overseas during World War I as part of the Australian Imperial Force. At the end of the war the AANS returned to its pre-war reserve status.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 605. In addition to the military nurses, a small group of civilian nurses dubbed the \\"Bluebirds\\" were recruited by the Australian Red Cross Society and served in French hospitals. Australian women during World War II The leaders of the female branches of the Australian military in 1942 Australian women played a larger role in World War II. Many women wanted to play an active role, and hundreds of voluntary women's auxiliary and paramilitary organisations had been formed by 1940. These included the Women's Transport Corps, Women's Flying Club, Women's Emergency Signalling Corps and Women's Australian National Services.Darian-Smith (1996), p. 62. In Brisbane alone there were six different organisations providing women with war-related training in July 1940, the largest of which was the Queensland-based Women's National Emergency Legion. The Federal Government and military did not initially support women being trained to serve in the armed forces, however, and these organisations were not taken seriously by the general public. A shortage of male recruits forced the military to establish female branches in 1941 and 1942. The RAAF established the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) in March 1941, the Army formed the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) in October 1941 and the Australian Army Medical Women's Service in December 1942 and the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) came into being in July 1942. Dennis (2008) In 1944 almost 50,000 women were serving in the military and thousands more had joined the civilian Australian Women's Land Army (AWLA). Many of these women were trained to undertake skilled work in traditionally male occupations in order to free servicemen for operational service. Women were also encouraged to work in industry and volunteer for air raid precautions duties or clubs for Australian and Allied servicemen.Darian- Smith (1996), pp. 62–63. The female branches of the military were disbanded after the war. Korean War Manpower shortages during the Korean War led to the permanent establishment of female branches of the military. In 1951 the WRANS was reformed and the Army and Air Force established the Women's Australian Army Corps (WAAC) and Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF) respectively. The proportion of women in the services was initially limited to four percent of their strength, though this was ignored by the RAAF.Horner (2001), pp. 321–324. The quota was lifted to 10 percent in the RAAF and RAN during the 1960s and 1970s while the Army recruited only on a replacement basis.Horner (2001), p. 324. Integration Male and female sailors on board in 2010 The role of women in the Australian military began to change in the 1970s. In 1975, which was the International Year of Women, the service chiefs established a committee to explore opportunities for increased female participation in the military. This led to reforms which allowed women to deploy on active service in support roles, pregnancy no longer being grounds for automatic termination of employment and changes to leave provisions. The WRAAF and WAAC were abolished in 1977 and 1979 respectively, with female soldiers being merged into the services. Equal pay was granted to servicewomen in 1979 and the WRANS was abolished in 1985. Despite being integrated into the military, there were still restrictions on female service. The ADF was granted an exemption from the Sexual Discrimination Act when it was introduced in 1984 so that it could maintain gender-based restrictions against women serving in combat or combat-related positions, which limited women to 40 percent of positions in the ADF. Combat-related roles As a result of personnel shortages in the late 1980s the restriction against women in combat-related positions was dropped in 1990, and women were for the first time allowed to serve in warships, RAAF combat squadrons and many positions in the Army. Women were banned from positions involving physical combat, however, and were unable to serve in infantry, armoured, artillery and engineering units in the Army and clearance diving and ground defence positions in the RAN and RAAF respectively. The ADF was not sufficiently prepared for integrating women into all units. Integration was hindered by entrenched discriminatory attitudes, sexual harassment and a perception that less demanding standards were applied to women. This led to a number of scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment on board , and the RAN's mishandling of these complaints. These scandals did great harm to the ADF's reputation at the time when it most needed servicewomen. The Defence Equality Organisation was established in 1997 in response to these problems, and it developed frameworks to facilitate the acceptance of women throughout the ADF.Horner (2001), p. 325. Deployments Female Australian soldiers in Afghanistan Women have formed part of ADF deployments around the world since the early 1990s. Female sailors were sent into a combat zone for the first time on board in 1991, female medical personnel were deployed to Iraq, Western Sahara and Rwanda during the early 1990s and 440 of the 5,500 Australians deployed to East Timor in November 1999 were women.Horner (2001), p. 326. Women also began to be promoted to command units in the late 1990s, and Air Commodore Julie Hammer became the first woman to reach one-star rank in 2000.Horner (2001), pp. 325–326. In 2015, 335 women were participating in overseas operations in frontline support positions, including in Afghanistan. Women in Combat roles On 27 September 2011, Defence Minister Stephen Smith announced that women will be allowed to serve in frontline combat roles by 2016. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013; this remaining restriction removed in 2014 once the physical standards required for service in these units were determined. Women have been directly recruited into all frontline combat positions since late 2016. Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the first woman to command a Royal Australian Air Force flying squadron. Women pilots and fighter pilots Women have been eligible for flying roles in the RAAF since 1987, with the RAAF’s first women pilots awarded their ‘Wings’ in 1988. In 1995, the majority of restrictions were lifted allowing women to train as fast jet pilots. In 2016, 42 women in the RAAF had graduated the pilot's course and gained their \\"wings\\", flying planes such as C-17 Globemasters, C-130 Hercules and Wedgetail airborne early warning and control planes. Women have also qualified as fast jet aircrew, with the first F-111 navigators graduating in 2000. In December 2017, the first two female RAAF fighter pilots graduated, having completed 'High Sierra'- the three week intensive exercise that marks the culmination of 2OCU’s six-month long ‘opcon’ operational conversion course on the F/A-18 Hornet. . A 2016 Australian Human Rights Commission report found that \\"the absence of female fast jet pilots is remarkable\\" given that the air forces of many comparable countries have had female fighter pilots since the 1990s. The report judged that there was no single factor responsible for this, rather, there are a series of structural and cultural factors that have prevented the progress of both female and male pilots in the Air Force. The majority of the recommendations from this report were accepted and as of February 2019, women make up 38 of 752 pilots in the trained permanent Air Force (around 5.05%), and 126 of 498 Officer Aviation Cadets under training (25.3%). Women in the Special forces Women had been recorded as having passed the physical selection tests for the Army's elite Commando Regiment over 20 years before the announcement of allowing women in combat roles. These women were barred from joining due to their gender, including notable Lieutenant Colonel Fleur Froggatt. In January 2012, Senior Defence sources said that while several women had recently passed physical entry tests for special forces, they had prevented further advancement due to 'injury concerns'. In refusing to provide the numbers of women who had passed entry tests for the SAS or commandos, or when they passed, Defence cited security concerns. Growing numbers of Women in the ADF A female member of No. 75 Squadron RAAF in 2008 Since the expansion in the number of positions available to women, there has been slow but steady growth in the percentage of female permanent defence personnel. In the 1989–1990 financial year women filled 11.4% of permanent ADF positions. In the 2005–2006 financial year women occupied 13.3% of permanent positions and 15.6% of reserve positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 40.3%.Khosa (2004). Page 52 and Australian Department of Defence (2006). 2005–06 Defence Annual Report. Page 281. The percentage of female members of the Australian labour force increased from approximately 41% to 45% between June 1989 and June 2006.Australian Bureau of Statistics Labour Force, Australia. In 2008 defence minister, Joel Fitzgibbon instructed the ADF to place a greater emphasis on recruiting women and addressing barriers to women being promoted to senior roles. In 2017-18, women made up 17.9% of The ADF workforce, and increase of 3.5 percentage points from 2013 (14.4%). There are still proportionally fewer women than men in senior leadership roles. Completion of Basic Training A common misconception is that women are not as able to complete the physically and mentally demanding initial-entry training, and this may lead to their smaller overall employment rate. This is demonstrably incorrect. The 2016-17 Women in the ADF report states completion rates for women and men in initial training have been comparable since 2011. In fact, initial-entry training completion for females in 2017-18 were slightly higher than the males, with general entry (other ranks/ non-officer) 91.9 per cent for women; 90.2 per cent for men. Similarly, the 2017-18 officer trainee completion rate in the Navy and Airforce were at 87.8 per cent for women; 81.9 per cent for men, and the Army officer trainees at 66.7 per cent for women; 65.8 per cent for men. Recruitment goals and strategies Each of the Services has set female participation targets to be achieved by 2023. These are 25 per cent for the Navy, 15 per cent for the Army and 25 per cent for the Air Force. In August 2016 the Chief of Army Lieutenant General Angus Campbell AO, DSC, in an address to the Defence Force Recruiting Conference stated that his “number one priority.. with respect to recruitment is increasing our diversity; with a focus on women and Indigenous Australians”, and that “My aim is that women will make up 25% of the Army – based on analysis of best practice across like work environments globally (military and appropriately related industries). I want and need the Army to benefit from the full talent of the other half of our citizens.” Since the Chief of Army has changed as of the 2nd of July 2018 to Lieutenant General Rick Burr AO, DSC, MVO, it is unknown whether he will strive to achieve the larger 25% target as his predecessor did. Specialised media campaigns aimed at women and reduced initial minimum period of service (IMPS) contracts (eg. 2 years instead of 4 years for certain roles) has reportedly attracted more women in each branch. The ‘Gap year’ program, aimed at younger women with only 1 year IMPS existing across each branch of ADF excels in female recruitment. Although small in number, 2018 recruitment rates of women were at 55% (Navy), 47% (Air force), and 34% (Army).

It is located between the Dundas and Stephens Islands and the Tsimpsean Peninsula near Prince Rupert. It is part of the Inside Passage and extends from Portland Inlet in the north to Porcher Island in the south. It may have been named in 1788 by British Captain Charles Duncan after John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, who was First Lord of the Admiralty at that time. Geography Chatham Sound is a semi-enclosed basin with an area of about . It is connected to the open waters of the Hecate Strait and Dixon Entrance via several channels, such as Main, Brown, Hudson Bay, and Edye Passages. Along its southern end, the sound provides access to inland passages such as the Marcus and Arthur Passages, and the Grenville Channel beyond that. The two major rivers that drain into the sound are the Nass River (via the Portland Inlet) and Skeena River (via the Inverness and Marcus Passages). Because of the large inflow of fresh water the salinity of the sound is lower than the adjacent ocean. Hydrography Most of Chatham Sound is less than deep, except in the northern part of the sound where depth exceeds . Chatham Sound is an area of very large tides, with tidal ranges reaching peak values of and an average tidal range of , tidal currents are proportionately strong, especially in the south and west areas.  Ecology  As a result of tidal mixing, Chatham Sound is an area of particularly high primary productivity and highly concentrated phytoplankton biomass. The sound has the largest diversity of shrimp species in the Pacific North Coast Integrated Management Area, with numbers dominated by humpback shrimp. There are also major aggregations of Dungeness crab in the area. Once thought to be extinct, sponge reefs are now known to be a significant component of the sound floor.

History Prairie Bluff first appeared on maps in 1819, the same year that Alabama was admitted to the Union as a state. It was listed erroneously as Prairie Blue on Fielding Lucas' Geographic, Statistical, and Historical Map of Alabama, printed in Philadelphia in 1822. However, another of Lucas' Alabama maps, also printed in 1822, lists it as Prairie Bluff. It is interchangeably listed as Dale, Daletown, or Prairie Bluff on subsequent maps from the 1830s until the mid-1850s, after which time Prairie Bluff is the only name used. It disappeared from maps altogether around 1900. The historic Greek-Revival style Dale Masonic Lodge No. 25 in Camden, completed in 1848, was originally established in what was known as Dale during 1827. The members voted to move their lodge during the 1840s to the county seat in Camden, incorporated in 1842. The county seat had been a short distance from Prairie Bluff, in the community of Canton Bend, until moved to Barboursville (later renamed Camden) in 1833. The town was located at the midpoint of an early road that connected Cahaba, the first state capital, and St. Stephens, the territorial capital. Situated atop a cliff overlooking the Alabama River, the town grew as river trade increased. A large cotton slide, used to move bales of cotton from the top of the cliff to paddle steamers on the river below, was located at the site. The steamboat Pittsburg sank near Prairie Bluff in May 1828, followed by the Jewess on October 28, 1841. The town was at its height in 1861, but declined rapidly in importance with the introduction of new railroads following the American Civil War. Portions of the site were inundated by the William \\"Bill\\" Dannelly Reservoir with the construction of the nearby Millers Ferry Lock and Dam in 1963. The only physical feature that remains at the site today is the Prairie Bluff Cemetery, with marked graves dating from the 1830s to the 1860s.

History Joliet's first airport, Originally known as Joliet Municipal Airport, was proposed by Illinois Senator Richard Barr in the mid-1920s. It was operated by the Joliet Park District, the first airport in the country to be operated by such an authority. The land was purchased in September 1928 and the airport was built with assistance from the United States Department of Commerce. The airport was dedicated in September 1930, with an aerobatics show and bomb-dropping. The Park District relocated their main office to the airport.

The Global Trade Exchange has a mysterious history dating from conception in 2004, a 2007-2008 year of hype, and sudden placement on \\"hold\\" status. Described as a ready-to-buy, commercially available database, the GTX was rush-funded by Congress as part of and championed relentlessly by then-United States Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff in evident disregard of objections of confused and frustrated U.S. private sector trade groups. After a year-long spate of official support, media hype, and after award of Congressional funding of $13 million, the GTX was put \\"on hold for further study by the [U.S.] Navy\\" in April 2008, for reasons still yet to-be explained. Touted by senior U.S. officials and Congress in 2007 as an anti-terrorism database for tracking long-haul shipping containers, the Global Trade Exchange's principal focus appears to have a different focus, notably advance trade-finance information for market-making purposes. The Global Trade Exchange (GTX) was mentioned in a 2007 Wikileaks cable as an intelligence agency trade data project, run by the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, intended to involve many other intelligence agencies worldwide.  DHS Intelligence Trade Data Project  Jon D. Glassman, former State Department Official, currently Vice President for Government Affairs at Northrop Grumman, forwarded the Global Trade Exchange in the Asia-Pacific and Middle-East regions In Spring of 2007 DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff began to actively promote the Global Trade Exchange to the media and trade community as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) database, able to provide unique and vital national security protection from 'all hazards' threats,https://web.archive.org/web/20091017223525/http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/trade/trade_outreach/coac/meetings/aug07_meet/aug_coac_min.ctt/aug_coac_min.doc Senior DHS Customs officials, described the GTX as a repository of corporate data, and transportation shipping data. Congress noted the GTX description as a COTS tool and placed it into the July 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations budget bill; this done above the vociferous objections of the U.S. private sector. Three major U.S. trade consortia rendered written and spoken testimony to Congress, expressing concerns about the sudden arrival of this new tool, the secrecy surrounding it, as well as posing questions as to why the U.S. Government would be sharing collected corporate data with foreign governments, such as Secretary Chertoff described.  Ports-related \\"Financial Services Data Warehouse\\"  Financial Services Data Warehouse. The early version of the Global Trade Exchange, presented at APEC seminar, Chile 2004 ISPS Financial Services Data Warehouse for APEC Meeting 2004, Chile Full cooperation, therefore, in current US risk-analytic data collection (including the future Global Trade Exchange—GTX experiment) and in US Container Security Initiative risk-based scanning is certainly highly counseled as a means to mitigate domestic US pressure for more extreme overseas surveillance requirements. Jon D. Glassman, Northrop Grumman.INTER-AMERICAN COMMITTEE AGAINST TERRORISM (CICTE), presented by Jon D. Glassman, Northrop Grumman, at the EIGHTH REGULAR SESSION, March 5 − 7, 2008, Washington, D.C., United States GTX was championed by former State Department official Jon D. Glassman most famous for having drafted the White Paper on El Salvador and for serving as Chargé des Affairs in the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan during CIA operations to support the Mujahadeen. Between 2004–2007, Mr. Glassman championed the Global Trade Exchange at various APEC counter-terrorism meetings and intergovernmental meetings in the Middle East, as a means of foregoing U.S. Congressional requirements for 100 per cent scanning of shipping containers. As early as 2004, Ambassador Glassman proposed, at various APEC counter-terrorism seminars, the Global Trade Exchange as an unregulated financial exchange using port-shipping manifest data, i.e. as a Northrop Grumman-led Financial Services Data Warehouse. A relationship to stock-trading was clear, but the relationship to counter-terrorism not. Many U.S. financial services sector presented this kind of tool for hedge-fund risk management.  2007: DHS Secretary Chertoff spearheads project  Michael Chertoff spearheaded the Global Trade Exchange as a DHS joint project with the DOD and ODNI \\"DHS,\\" Chertoff said, \\"is piloting, on a voluntary basis, a system that would provide expanded global access to trade information.\\" This system would involve the submission of an even broader range of data by a wider variety of supply chain actors to a third-party global trade exchange (GTX) that could be accessed by government agencies. More information would allow CBP to be more precise in identifying risks and to thus conduct fewer and better-targeted container inspections. Chertoff stressed that the GTX operator would be a \\"trusted aggregator\\" and that there would be \\"a stringent rule set\\" to make sure that sensitive business information is not \\"divulged or shared to competitors.\\" He noted that CBP hopes to put out a request for proposal on such a system in the \\"very near future\\".\\" Although never fully explained in terms of content, the Global Trade Exchange was noted as being one of the three pillars of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strategy for trade data-gathering. The Global Trade Exchange was toutedhttps://web.archive.org/web/20100308170358/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/commissioner/speeches_statements/basham_remarks.xml as a ready-made project run by a private-sector company in cooperation with foreign governments;https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did;=29200 data was to have been obtained on a voluntary basis by companies. On July 26, 2007 Senator Patty Murray added the GTX to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations budget, by adding Amendment (S.2499) into H.R. 2638.  Controversy about secrecy  CBP Ahern presented the Global Trade Exchange at a Maritime Security Expo, November 2007. U.S. trade groups expressed strong displeasure at the sudden implementation of the new project, as well as with the general lack of transparency, public interaction, and disclosure about GTX.https://web.archive.org/web/20110726203434/http://www.jig.org/news/submissions/2007/JIG%20comments%20regarding%20Global%20Trade%20Exchange%20-%20FINAL.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20080705011824/http://www.worldshipping.org/testimony_house_approps_homeland_security_subcommitee_42008.pdfhttp://www.ifcba.org/modules/news/article.php?storyid=883 These groups found the lack of information regarding justification for, and modalities such as were related to, data-sharing with foreign governments, particularly disturbing. These U.S. trade groups provided formal complaints and testimony to various Federal agencies, as well as various Congressional Committees and Subcommittees. These communications noted concerns that they didn't know the business-reporting sources of data nor what the data were; these groups were normally very involved with such definitions. Also, DHS mentions of using the GTX to share private sector data with foreign governments caused US industry risible worries about business data confidentiality.http://www.apl.com/security/documents/coac_111607_meetingnotes.pdf In December 2007, a request for quotehttp://www.hlswatch.com/sitedocs/gtx- pilot-request-for-quotations.jpg and statement of work were put forth by the DHS.  Congressional funding awarded in July 2007  Despite the controversy, Global Trade Exchange was allocated $13 million as part of the DHS section of the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Budget, in January 2008. Northrup Grumman presented the GTX in late February as part of wider DOD supply-chain \\"GEX\\" data-warehousing projects.http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi- bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=110_cong_house_committee_prints&docid;=f:39564e.wais This legislation was drafted by House Homeland Security Chief Counsel Denise Krepp.  \\"U.S. Attorneys involved in appropriating the database in October 2007  On 30 October 2007, Deputy Commissioner of Customs Thomas S. Winkowski testified to Rep. Henry Cuellar that U.S. Attorneys were still trying to \\"go around the legal challenges that [the U.S. government] had in obtaining the database and that Customs was \\"Still trying to get our arms around\\" the Global Trade Exchange, so that they could \\"know what's inside it\\".Testimony of Thomas S. Winkowski before the House Appropritions Committee  Discussed by the Senate Finance Committee in March 2008  On March 13, 2008, the Global Trade Exchange was discussed in the Senate Finance Committee, as part of the data- gathering program framework of the Homeland Security Department. The topic was presented by Mr. Sam Banks, Executive Vice President of Sandler and Travis Trade Advisory Services, the firm which won the no-bid award for the GTX in January 2008. Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg is a customs law and international trade consultancy firm known for management of the IBERC database used under the GATT textiles agreement, the Multifibre arrangement (MFA).  Global Trade Exchange project  Sam Banks, a former Deputy Commissioner, U.S. Customs Authority working for U.S. trade law firm Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg. forwarded the Global Trade Exchange Despite that the GTX was, in principle, a ready-to-purchase database of corporate data which was collected, the actual content of the global trade exchange was never fully presented to either the media nor to U.S. trade groups. Clues to the premise of the project can be found in the GTX statement of work,https://web.archive.org/web/20111006135827/http://www.strtrade.com/wti/2008/january/08/gtx_statement_of_work.pdf provided in the 2008 request for quote, released to a small select group of companies, in December 2008. :: GTX is envisioned as a privately operated, self-sustaining (e.g. user-fee based) trade information system that will collect commercial transaction data not currently available to us from parties in the supply chain who have contracted or provided services for the production/movement of international shipments and allow government and trade community participants to input and access trade data through an information broker on an expanded global basis. Data maintained by the GTX broker will be available to participating customs agencies 24X7 in the appropriate technical format. The commercial transaction data was to have been run by a private company information broker performing the following functions: Global Trade Exchange (GTX) as presented by Northrop Grumman, at a U.S. Government- sponsored Trade and Investment Seminar, Amman, Jordan, 2008 ::* Collection, integration, and transmission of data and images from multiple sources; ::* Coordinating the participation of all supply chain parties (e.g. foreign host governments & shippers) providing information to GTX; ::* Establishing and maintaining all necessary communications and interfaces; ::* Ensuring protection of all collected and/or transmitted by the GTX; ::* Transmitting data to participating foreign government systems in compliance with foreign government requirements.  March 2008: GTX on hold for further study  Three weeks after public presentations at U.S. trade conferences, and two months after funding was awarded by Congress, DHS customs official Jayon Ahern announced publicly that the project was premature, and would be delayed for further study.;https://web.archive.org/web/20091202123411/http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/newsroom/commissioner/speeches_statements/ncbfaa.xml it remained delayed as from Basham's departure, yet is again part of the 2009 DHS appropriations budgethttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL34482.pdf and remains under study for future implementation. In the U.S. House, House Homeland Security Appropriations Chairman David Price (D-NC) has repeatedly expressed wishes for results on the project. As late as May 1, 2009 Commissioner Ahern was providing explanations to Congressman David Price about the DHS ongoing pursuit to find the commercially available COTS database.

He played with the Westchester Community Symphony at the age of 14. Later he played electric bass in rock bands. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in English Literature, and performed with the San Francisco Youth Symphony and the UC Symphony Orchestra. His growing interest in jazz led him to play with John Handy, Bobby Hutcherson, Harold Land, Frank Morgan, Ernestine Anderson, Chris Connor and other Bay Area luminaries. In 1986 he joined Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers and moved to New York City. Beginning in the 1990s, he toured with the Tommy Flanagan trio until Flanagan's death in 2002, and has played with the Bill Charlap trio since then. He was a founding member of the collective hard bop sextet One for All and is a visiting artist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 2008, Washington played with The Blue Note 7, an all-star septet formed in honor of the 70th anniversary of Blue Note Records. His extensive discography numbers more than 400 recordings, and speaks to a constant demand for his services as a versatile side man.

It was intended to be an annual event, but was discontinued after the first edition. The game featured Pepperdine, a first-year football program, and Nebraska Wesleyan. Pepperdine, a school based in Los Angeles, California, was then known as George Pepperdine College (GPC), and the football team finished its first-ever season of play with an 8–1 record. After 1950, the Pepperdine football program struggled, and was eventually discontinued in 1961. In the last two years of the team's existence, it compiled a 1–17 record. Nebraska-Wesleyan's football program started in 1896. The program was discontinued in 1897 but resumed in 1908. The football program had never been to a bowl game as well and went 7-0-3 (3 ties) and was coached by George \\"Bus\\" Knight in his first year as a college coach. The mascot names for Nebraska-Wesleyan have changed from Coyotes to Sun Flowers to Plainsmen to Prairie Wolves and the program has won 22 conference titles. The football program continues to this day. The game was played on January 1, 1947 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was named in honor of Will Rogers, a famous Oklahoma native and self-proclaimed \\"Cowboy Philosopher,\\" who had died in a plane crash the previous decade. A snow storm hit Oklahoma City just before the game and the game was only attended by 800 people. Nebraska- Wesleyan led 7-0 at halftime but Pepperdine came back to win the game 38-13. The bowl game remains Nebraska-Wesleyan and Pepperdine's only college bowl appearance.

Provenance 1838 Poster advertisement for Memoirs of Grimaldi The book's accuracy is hard to establish, since it went through a number of revisions, not all with Grimaldi's input. Grimaldi's original manuscript, which he mostly dictated, was about 400 pages long; he completed it in December 1836. The original \\"excessively voluminous\\" version was apparently not good enough for publication, and in early 1837 he signed a contract with a collaborator, the obscure Grub Street writer Thomas Egerton Wilks, to \\"rewrite, revise, and correct\\" the manuscript. However, two months after signing the contract, Grimaldi died, and Wilks finished the job on his own, not only cutting and condensing the original but introducing extra material based on his conversations with Grimaldi. Wilks made no indication as to which parts of his production were actually written by Grimaldi and which parts were original to Wilks. He also chose to change Grimaldi's first-person narration to the third person. In September 1837, Wilks offered the Memoirs to Richard Bentley, publisher of the magazine Bentley's Miscellany. Bentley bought it, after securing the copyright from Grimaldi's estate, but he thought it was still too long and also poorly edited, so he asked one of his favorite young writers, the novelist Charles Dickens, then twenty-five years old, to re-edit and re-write it. At first Dickens was not inclined to take the job, and he wrote to Bentley in October 1837: > I have thought the matter over, and looked it over, too. It is very badly > done, and is so redolent of twaddle that I fear I cannot take it up on any > conditions to which you would be disposed to accede. I should require to be > assured three hundred pounds in the first instance without any reference to > the sale – and as I should be bound to stipulate in addition that the book > should not be published in numbers I think it would scarcely serve your > purpose. However, Bentley agreed to Dickens' terms (a guarantee of three hundred pounds and an agreement to publish the book all at once, and not in monthly numbers). Dickens signed a contract in November 1837, and completed the job in January 1838, mostly by dictation. Dickens seems never to have seen Grimaldi's original manuscript (which remained in the hands of the executor), but only worked from Wilks' version, which he heavily edited and re-wrote, under his regular , \\"Boz\\". Bentley published it in two octavo volumes, illustrated by George Cruikshank, in February 1838. How faithful this twice-edited, twice- rewritten version is to the original cannot now be determined, since the original manuscript was sold at an estate sale in 1874 and has never been seen since.

By Associated Press. Premature announcement of his cold fusion research with Stanley Pons, regarding excess heat in heavy water, caused a media sensation and elicited skepticism and criticism from many in the scientific community. Despite the negative publicity, Pons and Fleischmann continued their research in cold fusion. Personal life Fleischmann was born in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, in 1927. His father was a wealthy lawyer and his mother the daughter of a high-ranking Austrian civil officer. Since his father was of Jewish heritage, Fleischmann's family moved to the Netherlands, and then to England in 1938, to avoid Nazi persecution. His father died of the complications of injuries received in a Nazi prison, after which Fleischmann lived for a period with his mother in a leased cottage in Rustington, Sussex. His early education was obtained at Worthing High School for Boys. After serving in the Czech Airforce Training Unit during the war, he moved to London to study for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in chemistry at Imperial College London. His PhD was awarded in 1951, under the supervision of Professor Herrington, for his thesis on the diffusion of electrogenerated hydrogen through palladium foils. He met Sheila, his future wife, as a student and remained married to her for 62 years. Career Electrochemistry (1950s to 1983) Fleischmann's professional career was focused almost entirely on fundamental electrochemistry. Fleischmann went on to teach at King's College, Durham University, which in 1963 became the newly established University of Newcastle upon Tyne.King's College , Official Records of Durham University. In 1967, Fleischmann became Professor of Electrochemistry at the University of Southampton, occupying the Faraday Chair of Chemistry. From 1970 to 1972, he was president of the International Society of Electrochemists. In 1973, together with Patrick J. Hendra and A. James McQuillan, he played an important role in the discovery of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering effect (SERS), for which the University of Southampton was awarded a National Chemical Landmark plaque by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2013, and he developed the ultramicroelectrode in the 1980s.Bard, A.J.; Faulkner, L.R. Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 2nd Edition, 2000. In 1979, he was awarded the medal for electrochemistry and thermodynamics by the Royal Society of London. In 1982 he retired from the University of Southampton. In 1985 he received the Olin Palladium Award from the Electrochemical Society, and in 1986 was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society. He retired from teaching in 1983 and was given an honorary professorship at Southampton University. Fellowships, prizes and awards * Secretary/Treasurer of the International Society of Electrochemistry (1964–1967) * President of the International Society of Electrochemistry (1973–1974) * Electrochemistry and Thermodynamics Medal of the Royal Society of Chemistry (1979) * Fellowship of the Royal Society (1985) * Olin Palladium Medal of the Electrochemical Society (1986) Cold fusion (1983 to 1992) Fleischmann confided to Stanley Pons that he might have found what he believed to be a way to create nuclear fusion at room temperatures. From 1983 to 1989, he and Pons spent $100,000 in self-funded experiments at the University of Utah. Fleischmann wanted to publish it first in an obscure journal, and had already spoken with a team that was doing similar work in a different university for a joint publication. The details have not surfaced, but it seems that the University of Utah wanted to establish priority over the discovery and its patents by making a public announcement before the publication.Shamoo, 2003, 86Simon, 2002, 28–36 In an interview with 60 Minutes on 19 April 2009, Fleischmann said that the public announcement was the university's idea, and that he regretted doing it.Cold Fusion is Hot Again, CBS News http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/17/60minutes/main4952167_page4.shtml This decision, perceived as short-circuiting the way science is usually communicated to other scientists, later caused heavy criticism against Fleischmann and Pons. On 23 March 1989 the work was announced at a press conference as \\"a sustained nuclear fusion reaction,\\"Press release, published in Huizenga, Cold fusion, Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 289 which was quickly labelled by the press as cold fusionSimon, 2002, p. 39. Simon says that the first article naming Fleischmann's work as \\"cold fusion\\" was: Jerry Bishop, Wall Street Journal, \\"Research in Utah to announce a development in fusion energy\\", 23 March 1989, or \\"Scientist sticks to claimed test-tube fusion advance\\", 27 March., and errata in Vol. 263. – a result previously thought to be unattainable. On 26 March Fleischmann warned on the Wall Street Journal Report not to try replications until a published paper was available two weeks later in Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, but that did not stop hundreds of scientists who had already started work at their laboratories the moment they heard the news on 23 March,Simon, 2002, page 35 and more often than not they failed to reproduce the effects. Those who failed to reproduce the claim attacked the pair for fraudulent, sloppy, and unethical work;Shamoo, 2003, pages 76, 97 incomplete,Simon, 2002, p. 119 unreproducible, and inaccurate results; and erroneous interpretations. When the paper was finally published, both electrochemists and physicists called it \\"sloppy\\" and \\"uninformative\\", and it was said that, had Fleischmann and Pons waited for the publication of their paper, most of the trouble would have been avoided because scientists would not have gone so far in trying to test their work.Simon, 2002, p. 43 Fleischmann and Pons sued an Italian journalist who had published very harsh criticisms against them, but the judge rejected the case saying that criticisms were appropriate given the scientists' behaviour, the lack of evidence since the first announcement, and the lack of interest shown by the scientific community, and that they were an expression of the journalist's \\"right of reporting\\".Simon, 2002, pags. 110–112 Retirement (from 1992) In 1992, Fleischmann moved to France with Pons to continue their work at the IMRA laboratory (part of Technova Corporation, a subsidiary of Toyota), but in 1995 he retired and returned to England.Simon, 2002, p. 137 He co-authored further papers with researchers from the US NavySzpak, S., et al., Thermal behavior of polarized Pd/D electrodes prepared by co-deposition.

The film features Parthipan, Meena and Soundarya in the lead roles. Plot Jeevan (Parthiban) is a tempo driver and a socially conscious middle- aged man who wants to clean up society. His motivation is his late father (Thalaivasal Vijay) who was murdered as he tried to be a crusader. Jeevan is intelligent enough to realize that he is not a one-man-army to fight the evils and corruption in society. So what he does is to motivate the public to fight for their rights. He lives in a small place with four friends and together they do what little they can to improve the condition around. The Carnatic singer and widow woman Dikshanya (Soundarya) has a silent admiration for Jeevan, but it is the Telugu woman Meena Kumari (Meena) who wins him over and forces him to marriage by telling a lie that she has cancer. There are about 18 antagonists, who make their entry and exit. Thereafter, Jeevan brings them all together and each of them gets a chance to support his stand and speak on the circumstances which forced them to take to crime. Jeevan gives a long lecture and transforms them into being good citizens.

Named in honor of the state of Minas Gerais, the ship was laid down in April 1907 as the lead ship of its class, making the country the third to have a dreadnought under construction and igniting a naval arms race between Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Two months after its completion in January 1910, Minas Geraes was featured in Scientific American, which described it as \\"the last word in heavy battleship design and the ... most powerfully armed warship afloat\\".\\"The Brazilian Battleship Minas Geraes\\", Scientific American 102, no. 12, 19 March 1910, 240–241 (New York: Munn & Co., Inc.) . In November 1910, Minas Geraes was the focal point of the Revolt of the Lash. The mutiny, triggered by racism and physical abuse, spread from Minas Geraes to other ships in the Navy, including its sister , the elderly coastal defense ship Deodoro, and the recently commissioned cruiser . Led by the \\"Black Admiral\\" João Cândido Felisberto, the mutineers threatened to bombard the Brazilian capital of Rio de Janeiro if their demands were not met. As it was not possible to end the situation militarily—the only loyal troops nearby being small torpedo boats and army troops confined to land—the National Congress of Brazil conceded to the rebels' demands, including a grant of amnesty, peacefully ending the mutiny. When Brazil entered the First World War in 1917, Britain's Royal Navy declined Brazil's offer of Minas Geraes for duty with the Grand Fleet because the ship was outdated; it had not been refitted since entering service, so range-finders and a fire-control system had not been added. São Paulo underwent modernization in the United States in 1920; in 1921, Minas Geraes received the same treatment. A year later, Minas Geraes sailed to counter the first of the Tenente revolts. São Paulo shelled the rebels' fort, and they surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns. In 1924, mutineers seized São Paulo and attempted to persuade the crews of Minas Geraes and several other ships to join them, but were unsuccessful. Minas Geraes was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and underwent further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, the ship was anchored in Salvador as the main defense of the port, as it was too old to play an active part in the war. For the last nine years of its service life, Minas Geraes remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for scrapping in March 1954.  Background  Beginning in the late 1880s, Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence, helped along by an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and naval revolts in 1891 and 1893–94.Barman, Citizen Emperor, 403; Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 240; Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy,\\" 32; Martins, \\"Colossos do mares,\\" 75. By the turn of the 20th century it was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage,Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy,\\" 32; Martins, \\"Colossos do mares,\\" 75. despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 403; Livermore, \\"Battleship Diplomacy,\\" 32. View of the Minas Geraes from above one of the gun turrets At the turn of the twentieth century, soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought prosperity to the Brazilian economy.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 403. The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a large naval building program in 1904,Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 404. which authorized the construction of a large number of warships, including three battleships.Scheina, Naval History, 80; English, Armed Forces, 108. The Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three battleships on 23 July 1906.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 240–245. While the first designs for these ships were derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship Norge and the British (originally Chilean) , the contracted ships were to follow Armstrong Whitworth's Design 439 (Design 188 in Vickers' files). They would displace 11,800 long tons (12,000 tonnes), have a speed of 19 knots (22 mph; 35 km/h), and be protected by belt armor of 9 inches (23 cm) and deck armor of 1.5 in (3.8 cm). Each ship would be armed with twelve 10-inch (25 cm) guns mounted in six twin turrets. These turrets would be mounted in a hexagonal configuration, similar to the later German s.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 244–246. Two of these ships were laid down by Armstrong in Elswick (Minas Geraes and Rio de Janeiro), while the other was subcontracted out to Vickers in Barrow (São Paulo). The new dreadnought concept, which premiered in December 1906 upon the completion of the namesake ship in December 1906, rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete.Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 246. The money authorized for naval expansion was redirected by new Minister of the Navy, Rear Admiral Alexandrino Fario de Alencar, to building two dreadnoughts, with plans for a third dreadnought after the first was completed, two scout cruisers (which became the ), ten destroyers (the ), and three submarines.Scheina, Naval History, 81; Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers, \\"Brazil,\\" 883. The three battleships on which construction had just begun were demolished beginning on 7 January 1907, and the design of the new dreadnoughts was approved by the Brazilians on 20 February 1907. Even though the greater cost of these ships meant that only two ships could begin immediately, plans went ahead.Whitley, Battleships, 24. Minas Geraes, the lead ship, was laid down by Armstrong on 17 April 1907, while São Paulo followed thirteen days later at Vickers.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 404; Scheina, Naval History, 321; Topliss, \\"The Brazilian Dreadnoughts,\\" 249. The news shocked Brazil's neighbors, especially Argentina, whose Minister of Foreign Affairs remarked that either Minas Geraes or São Paulo could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets.Martins, \\"Colossos do mares,\\" 76. In addition, Brazil's order meant that they had laid down a dreadnought before many of the other major maritime powers, such as Germany, France or Russia, and the two ships made Brazil just the third country to have dreadnoughts under construction, behind the United Kingdom and the United States.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 403; Whitley, Battleships, 13. In particular, the United States now actively attempted to court Brazil as an ally; caught up in the spirit, U.S. naval journals began using terms like \\"Pan Americanism\\" and \\"Hemispheric Cooperation\\". Newspapers and journals around the world, particularly in Britain and Germany, speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament.Scheina, \\"Brazil,\\" 404; Martins, \\"Colossos do mares,\\" 77.  Early career  Launch of the Minas Geraes Minas Geraes was christened by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, the wife of the Brazilian minister to Great Britain,\\"Launch Greatest Warships,\\" New York Times, 11 September 1908, 5. and launched at Newcastle-on-Tyne on 10 September 1908. During fitting-out, it was moved to Vickers' Walker Yard, and thousands turned out to see the incomplete ship squeeze barely underneath and through overhead and swing bridges.\\"New Brazilian Battleship,\\" Times (London), 17 August 1909, 10b. After completion, Minas Geraes was handed over by Armstrong on 5 January to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck. The British Royal Navy carried out its gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government.Tupper, Reminiscences, 185. Although the idea of having superfiring turrets was not new—the American s were also designed and built in this fashion around the same time—the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily. Minas Geraes left the Tyne on 5 February 1910 and traveled to Plymouth before beginning a voyage to the United States on 8 February.\\"Naval and Military Intelligence,\\" The Times, 7 February 1910, 4f; \\"Naval and Military Intelligence,\\" The Times, 9 February 1910, 8c. When the ship reached Norfolk, Virginia, it escorted the American armored cruiser , which was carrying the body of the former Brazilian ambassador to the United States Joaquim Nabuco (who had died in Washington, D.C., on 17 January) to Rio de Janeiro.Martins, \\"Colossos do mares,\\" 76; \\"Minas Geraes Fogbound,\\" The New York Times, 3 March 1910, 13; Whitley, Battleships, 27–28. The two ships set sail on 17 March 1910 and reached Rio de Janeiro one month later,Whitley, Battleships, 27–28. where Minas Geraes was commissioned into the Brazilian Navy on 18 April. Soon after Minas Geraes arrival in Brazil, the country's prosperity began to wane, and a severe depression hit the Brazilian economy. The economic hardship, the racism prevalent in all branches of the Brazilian armed forces,Smallman, Fear & Memory, 28 and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships spawned a mutiny known as the Revolt of the Lash, or Revolta da Chibata, among sailors on the most powerful ships.Smallman, Fear & Memory, 28; Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 74.  Revolt of the Lash  Minas Geraes leaving the River Tyne, England, 1910 The initial spark was provided on 16 November 1910 when Afro-Brazilian sailor Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. The sailor's back was later described by José Carlos de Carvalho, a retired navy captain assigned to be the Brazilian government's representative to the mutineers, as \\"a mullet sliced open for salting.\\"Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 41. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the Lei Áurea (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. The revolt began aboard Minas Geraes at around 10 pm on 22 November; the ship's commander and several loyal crewmen were murdered in the process. Soon after, São Paulo, the new cruiser Bahia, the coast-defense ship , the minelayer , the training ship , and the torpedo boats and all revolted with relatively little violence. The first four ships represented the newest and strongest ships in the navy; Minas Geraes, São Paulo, and Bahia had been completed and commissioned only months before. Deodoro was twelve years old and had recently undergone a refit. The crews of the smaller warships made up only two percent of the mutineers, and some moved to the largest ships after the revolt began.Love, Revolt, 20, 28–31, 35–36; Morgan, \\"Revolt of the Lash,\\" 32–38. Afro-Brazilian and pardo sailors pose for a photographer on board Minas Geraes, probably during the ship's visit to the United States in early 1913. The ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the abolition of what they called slavery: they objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) and the use of whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 40–42. Humiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The officers believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. The rebels, believing an attack was imminent, sailed their ships out of Guanabara Bay and spent the night of 23–24 November at sea, only returning during daylight. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser Rio Grande do Sul, Bahias sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns. They planned to attack on the morning of the 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125–23 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on the 26th.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 44–46. During the revolt, the ships were noted by many observers to be well handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, which led to a suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers could handle the ships.Morgan, \\"The Revolt of the Lash,\\" 39–40, 48–49, 52. The crews of the torpedo boats remained loyal to the government,Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 74 and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers; a major problem for the authorities was that many of the men who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause. The additional possibility of the capital being bombarded forced the National Congress of Brazil to give in to the rebels' demands. The demands included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret. Its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26 November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy. In 1913, Minas Geraes took the Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lauro Müller, to the United States, reciprocating the visit U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root had paid to Brazil seven years earlier.\\"Brazilian Envoy Host on Warship,\\" New York Times, 12 July 1913, 7; \\"Tell Brazil's Envoy of Trade Problems,\\" New York Times, 18 June 1913, 14.  First World War  Minas Geraes gun trials; this picture was taken when ten 12-inch guns were trained to port to fire a full broadside. A Scientific American article of 1910 remarked that this was \\"the greatest broadside ever fired from a battleship\\". Even though the First World War did not touch Brazilian soil, it had crushing effects on Brazil's economy.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, pp. 35–36 Prices for rubber and coffee plummeted; the war had only a small need for rubber, and Britain allowed no coffee into Europe as space on merchant ships was reserved for \\"essential items\\". In addition, coffee was declared to be contraband, so every Brazilian shipment to the Central Powers was subject to search and seizure; even shipments to some neutral countries were barred to ensure that no coffee would get through. Despite these restrictions, neutral Brazil was pro-Allied for the first three years of the war because of its sizable merchant fleet; as merchantmen from Allied countries were sunk, Brazilian ships were able to take over routes that had been vacated. This policy exposed them to attack by German submarines, and after the German declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, several Brazilian ships were sunk, driving the country closer to declaring war on the Central Powers. Brazil revoked its neutrality in the war between the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not declare war. At the same time, all German merchant ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were unusable due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 36 The Brazilian Navy was sent out to patrol the South Atlantic with French, British and American naval units, even though none of its ships had anti-submarine capabilities and, not being at war with the Central Powers, its ships were not supposed to engage any threat outside territorial waters.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 35, 37–38 Another Brazilian merchant ship, , was sunk by German submarine U-93 off Spain on 18 October, and eight days later Brazil declared war. Brazil offered to send Minas Geraes and São Paulo to serve with the British Grand Fleet, but this offer was declined because both ships were in poor condition and lacked modern fire-control systems. Neither of the two dreadnoughts had undergone any form of refitting since their original construction in Britain.Roderick Barman \\"Brazil in the First World War\\", page 26 \\"History Today\\", March 2014 Fourteen of São Paulos eighteen boilers failed when voyaging to New York in June 1918 for a modernization.Whitley, Battleships, 28  Inter-war period  Sketches of a Minas Geraes-class ship from the 1923 Brassey's Naval and Shipping Annual, depicting the ships after their 1920s refits in the United States São Paulos refit was finished on 17 January 1920 and it returned to Brazil; on 15 July Minas Geraes departed for New York for its own refit.Whitley, Battleships, 27\\"Brazilian Dreadnought Coming Here,\\" The New York Times, 17 July 1920, 3 (PDF). Beginning on 22 August,Whitley, Battleships, 26 the day it arrived,\\"Brazilian Battleship Arrives,\\" The New York Times, 11 (PDF). and finishing on 4 October 1921, the battleship was dramatically modernized, with Sperry fire-control equipment and Bausch and Lomb range-finders for the two superfiring turrets fore and aft. A vertical armor bulkhead was fitted inside the main turrets, and the secondary battery of guns was reduced from 22 to 12; five guns in casemates were removed from each side. A few modern AA guns were fitted: two 3\\"/50 caliber guns from Bethlehem Steel were added on the aft superstructure, guns were added near each turret, and 3-pounder guns were removed from the tops of turrets. While being refitted on 16 September 1921, a squad of Brazilian sailors stood at attention on the rear deck of the ship as the remains of the crew of the ZR-2 dirigible disaster passed by on the British light cruiser . In July 1922, Minas Geraes joined São Paulo in helping to quash the first of the Revolução Tenentista (English: Tenente revolts), in which the garrison of Rio de Janeiro's Fort Copacabana rebelled and began bombarding the city. São Paulo shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; Minas Geraes did not fire its guns.Guilherme Poggio, Um encouraçado contra o forte: 2ª Parte, Poder Naval Online, n.d., accessed 10 June 2009 [,archived version accessed 12 April 2009]. In 1924, Minas Geraes was involved in another mutiny, but remained on the side of the government. First Lieutenant Hercolino Cascardo, seven second lieutenants and others commandeered São Paulo in Rio de Janeiro's harbor on 4 November 1924. Their goal was to force the government to release prisoners who had participated in the 1922 Tenente revolts from confinement aboard the prison ship Cuibaba; the mutineers' demands were not met. São Paulos boilers were then fired, and the ship \\"steamed menacingly\\" around Minas Geraes in an attempt to entice its and other ships to join the rebellion. São Paulo was only able to sway the crew of one old torpedo boat to its cause. its crew, angry that Minas Geraes would not join them, shot a six-pounder at Minas Geraes, wounding a cook. The mutineers then sailed out of the harbor, exchanging shots with forts at the entrance along the way, and set course for Montevideo, Uruguay. The condensers failed along the way, and they reached Montevideo on 10 November making only . The rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted asylum, while the remainder re-hoisted the colors of Brazil.Whitley, Battleships, 29Mike Bennighof, \\"Brazil's Dreadnoughts,\\" Avalanche Press, October 2006, accessed 16 April 2006.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 129 Aerial view of Minas Geraes after modernization. Between June 1931 and April 1938, Minas Geraes was totally reconstructed and modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard. It was converted from its old coal–oil combination to all-oil firing. All eighteen of the original Babcock & Wilcox boilers were removed in favor of six new John I. Thornycroft & Company boilers. The former No. 1 boiler room and all twelve of the side coal bunkers were converted to fuel oil storage tanks; the upper coal bunkers were removed. In addition, Minas Geraes dynamos were replaced with new turbogenerators. The most striking aesthetic change was the trunking of the boiler uptakes into a single funnel. The fire-control systems that had been fitted after the First World War were also modernized in favor of Zeiss range- finders. The guns were overhauled; two extra guns were added (making 14 total), and six Madsen guns were installed, including two on the top of 'X' turret. The maximum elevation of the 12-inch guns was upped from 13° to 18°.Gardiner and Chesneau, 416  Second World War and later career  Minas Geraes in Salvador during 1942, after its major refit As in the First World War, Brazil was neutral during the early years of the Second World War. German attacks on Brazilian merchant ships pushed the country into war on the Allied side; Brazil declared war on 21 August 1942, taking effect on 31 August.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 162–164 Apart from three destroyers launched in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years, Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 164 The mainstays of the fleet, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, , and , were all over thirty years old.Gardiner and Gray (1984), pp. 404–405 Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, the ship was still too old and in too poor a condition for any active role in the Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador for the duration of the war. Minas Geraes was inactive for much of the rest of its career. Decommissioned on 16 May 1952, it was used as a stationary headquarters for the Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian Navy until 17 December of that year. The ship was removed from the naval register on 31 December, and sold to the Italian ship breaking company SA Cantiere Navale de Santa Maria. Minas Geraes was taken under tow on 1 March 1954 and arrived in Genoa on 22 April; the old dreadnought, which had been in service for more than forty years, was broken up for scrap later that year.

It consists of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and the Administrator of the Northern Territory, who represents the Governor-General. It is one of three unicameral parliaments in Australia, along with those of Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The Legislative Assembly replaced the previous Legislative Council in 1974. It sits in Parliament House, Darwin. The leader of the party with the most seats in the Legislative Assembly is invited by the Administrator to form the Government of the Northern Territory. The head of the government is the Chief Minister. Source of legislative powers The Parliament of the Northern Territory, which comprises the Legislative Assembly and the Administrator, exercises the legislative power in the Territory which are similar to those of the Australian state parliaments. The Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974 (Cth) granted self-government to the Territory. The federal government retains control of certain legislative areas, including Aboriginal land, industrial relations, national parks and uranium mining. However, while the state parliaments derive their legislative powers from constitutional sources, the Northern Territory derives its legislative power from the delegation of powers from the Commonwealth. The Australian Parliament thus retains the right to legislate for the Territory, if it chooses to exercise it. This includes the power to override any legislation passed by the Northern Territory Parliament. For example, in response to the Northern Territory Parliament's passage of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995, the Territory's voluntary euthanasia law, the federal Parliament passed the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997, which amended the laws granting self-government to the territories–in the Northern Territory's case, the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978–to remove that area from the legislative competences of the territories. History From 1911 to 1947 the laws of the Northern Territory were made by the Commonwealth Government. In 1947 the Northern Territory (Administration) Act was amended to provide for a territory legislature. The first legislative council for the Northern Territory was created in Darwin in March 1948. It consisted of seven official members appointed by the Governor-General, six elected members and the administrator as president of the council. In 1974 the Legislative Council was replaced by a fully elected Legislative Assembly with nineteen members. From 1974 until 2001, the Assembly was controlled by the conservative Country Liberal Party, which is affiliated with the federal Liberal-National coalition. However, at the 2001 election, the Labor Party won government for the first time on a one- seat majority, with Clare Martin becoming the Territory's first Labor and first female Chief Minister. Labor won 19 seats to the CLP's 4 at the 2005 election. Martin resigned in 2007 with Paul Henderson becoming Labor leader, and retained government with another one-seat majority at the 2008 election. The CLP led by Terry Mills defeated Labor at the 2012 election with 16 seats to Labor's 8. Mills resigned in 2013 with Adam Giles becoming CLP leader. The CLP was reduced to a one-seat majority in 2014 when three CLP members defected to the Palmer United Party, however one later rejoined the CLP. After further defections, numbers fell to minority government status in July 2015.Kezia Purick quits Northern Territory Country Liberals party, Government loses one- seat majority: ABC 20 July 2015Adam Giles would 'love to go to an early election' after Kezia Purick resigns Country Liberals party: ABC 20 July 2015 The 2016 election saw a landslide CLP defeat which brought Labor to power led by Chief Minister Michael Gunner. The position of Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has been held by CLP-turned-independent MP Kezia Purick since 23 October 2012. Despite Labor's massive majority following the 2016 election, the incoming Labor government re-appointed Purick as Speaker.NT Labor Government announces female-dominated Cabinet: ABC 11 September 2016 In 2020, Purick's role as Speaker was revoked as a result of an ICAC investigation. Chansey Paech took the role, until the dissolution of parliament, which preceded the 2020 Northern Territory general election. Following this election, Paech resigned as Speaker on 7 September 2020 to become a minister in the Gunner cabinet. Deputy speaker Ngaree Ah Kit is currently acting speaker until the parliament resumes in October to elect a new presiding officer.

It is a major east-west route which connects Route 21 to Interstate 55. For the majority of its length, Route M is a four lane divided highway with limited access. At its junction with Interstate 55, Route M becomes an undivided two lane road until its eastern terminus at U.S. 61/67. Route M was rerouted to its present location in the late 1990s after traffic became too great for the original road to handle. The original route is now known as Old Route M. Route description Route M begins as a four-lane divided highway at a diamond interchange with Route 21 near the community of Otto. West of the interchange, the highway is called Route MM. The highway heads east for less than where it has a partial cloverleaf interchange with the former alignment of Route 21, appropriately named Old Route 21. It continues east where there are two turn-offs which connect to nearby grade-separated highways. The first highway is the former alignment of Route M (Old Route M), the second is Old Lemay Ferry Road near the community of Antonia. Only the eastbound lanes have direct access to Old Lemay Ferry Road. Access is provided to the westbound lanes via median u-turn crossovers on either side of the intersection. Route M continues east, where it has two at-grade intersections before entering Barnhart; one at St. Luke's Church Road and the other at Moss Hollow Road. At Barnhart, the intersection with Marriott Parkway connects Interstate 55 traffic with gas stations and retail stores. , the I-55 interchange was being reconstructed to better handle access to southbound I-55. East of the I-55 interchange, Route M becomes a two-lane highway and ends a mile (1.6 km) later at a T intersection with U.S. Route 61 / U.S. Route 67. Route M, along with Route 21, make up the Jefferson County Scenic Byway. History Due to an increasing number of accidents at the intersection with Old Lemay Ferry Road, MoDOT rebuilt the intersection in 2007, with the eastbound lanes only having access to Old Lemay Ferry Road. Turnarounds built short distances east and west of the intersection allow access to and from the westbound lanes. On December 7, 2009, access to southbound I-55 was closed when MoDOT began a project to rebuild the interchange. The project is scheduled to last through the end of 2010. Southbound access to I-55 from Route M, which had featured a loop ramp, was being relocated to a new roundabout on Metropolitan Boulevard, which will also connect to a park and ride. As of 2011, the interchange is fully open. Southbound I-55 access is possible through a roundabout.

Especially the maintaining of a continuous flow of processing tasks is desired with a minimum of idle time and a minimum of waiting time. Flow shop scheduling is a special case of job shop scheduling where there is strict order of all operations to be performed on all jobs. Flow shop scheduling may apply as well to production facilities as to computing designs. A special type of flow shop scheduling problem is the permutation flow shop scheduling problem in which the processing order of the jobs on the resources is the same for each subsequent step of processing. Formal definition There are n machines and m jobs. Each job contains exactly n operations. The i-th operation of the job must be executed on the i-th machine. No machine can perform more than one operation simultaneously. For each operation of each job, execution time is specified. Operations within one job must be performed in the specified order. The first operation gets executed on the first machine, then (as the first operation is finished) the second operation on the second machine, and so on until the n-th operation. Jobs can be executed in any order, however. Problem definition implies that this job order is exactly the same for each machine. The problem is to determine the optimal such arrangement, i.e. the one with the shortest possible total job execution makespan. Sequencing performance measurements (γ) The sequencing problem can be stated as determining a sequence S such that one or several sequencing objectives are optimized. # (Average) Flow time, \\\\sum (w_i) F_i # Makespan, Cmax # (Average) Tardiness, \\\\sum (w_i) T_i # .... detailed discussion of performance measurement can be found in Malakooti(2013). Complexity of flow shop scheduling As presented by Garey et al. (1976), most of extensions of the flow shop scheduling problems are NP- Hard and few of them can be solved optimally in O(nlogn), for example F2prmuCmax can be solved optimally by using Johnson's Rule. Solution methods The proposed methods to solve flow shop scheduling problems can be classified as exact algorithm such as Branch and Bound and Heuristic algorithm such as genetic algorithm.  Minimizing makespan, Cmax  F2prmuCmax and F3prmuCmax can be solved optimally by using Johnson's Rule (1954) but for general case there is no algorithm that guarantee the optimality of the solution. Here is minimization using Johnson's Rule: The flow shop contains n jobs simultaneously available at time zero and to be processed by two machines arranged in series with unlimited storage in between them. The processing time of all jobs are known with certainty. It is required to schedule n jobs on machines so as to minimize makespan. The Johnson's rule for scheduling jobs in two machine flow shop is given below: In an optimal schedule, job i precedes job j if min{p1i,p2j} < min{p1j,p2i}. Where as, p1i is the processing time of job i on machine 1 and p2i is the processing time of job i on machine 2. Similarly, p1j and p2j are processing times of job j on machine 1 and machine 2 respectively. The steps are summarized below for Johnson's algorithms: let, p1j=processing time of job j on machine 1 p2j=processing time of job j on machine 2 Johnson's Algorithm Step 1:Form set1 containing all the jobs with p1j < p2j Step 2:Form set2 containing all the jobs with p1j > p2j, the jobs with p1j=p2j may be put in either set. Step 3: Form the sequence as follows: (i) The job in set1 go first in the sequence and they go in increasing order of p1j(SPT) (ii) The jobs in set2 follow in decreasing order of p2j (LPT). Ties are broken arbitrarily. This type schedule is referred as SPT(1)-LPT(2) schedule.  Other objectives  The algorithm is optimal.

The White Queen is talking to Alice, when she suddenly starts \\"baa-ing\\" and then seems to 'wrap herself in wool'. Alice figures out she is in a shop, and that The White Queen has turned into a sheep. The Sheep sits in her chair knitting as Alice looks around the shop. She gives Alice a pair of her knitting needles, and asks her if she can row. As Alice begins to answer, she realizes that they are in a little boat, and that the needles have turned into oars. As they glide along the water, the Sheep repeatedly shouts out \\"Feather\\", which means to lift the oar blades out of the water, turn them to a horizontal plane and swing them toward the bow so they don't get 'caught' in the water.

The show was emceed by Gail Smith, a close friend of his who later became president of the Ritchie Valens Memorial Fan Club in Los Angeles. Valens' guitar and vocals were only accompanied by drummer Don Phillips. The concert was taped using a small portable tape recorder. After Valens' untimely death on February 3, 1959, numerous Ritchie Valens Fan Clubs were formed all over the nation. By late 1960, with no further records released since the \\"Ritchie\\" album a year before, his manager Robert Keane received letters en masse from fan club members who were hoping there were more of Valens' songs to be released. Keane responded by obtaining the tape from the Pacoima Junior High show and pressing it to record. To fill the \\"live\\" side of the album, an early demo of \\"Come On, Let's Go\\", bearing no resemblance to the released \\"hit\\" version, was added with live audience dubbed in.

When a vampire threatens to name all the vampires of Los Angeles, Mick is helped by his girlfriend Beth Turner (Sophia Myles) and the rest of the vampires to track her down. Due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, production of Moonlight halted on December 19, 2007, and only twelve episodes of the original thirteen-episode order were made. Once the Writers' Strike ended, CBS announced that Moonlight would return April 25, 2008 with four new episodes, to be part of the series' first season. On May 13, 2008, CBS announced that Moonlight was officially canceled. \\"Sonata\\" was watched by 7.47 million viewers upon its original broadcast, and received generally positive reviews for providing closure of the characters and storylines. Plot Beth meets with Emma Monaghan, a vampire who had sired the man she fell in love with so they could be together forever. Beth is surprised when she learns that Emma and her husband Jackson are still together after 150 years. Emma kills Dominiq, a basketball player with ties to Josef Kostan (Jason Dohring) and several other vampires. She is imprisoned, but she threatens to name every vampire in Los Angeles unless Mick breaks her out. Mick and the other vampires team up and help her escape, but are forced to kill her and Jackson due to treason, as she had threatened to expose her fellow vampires.

Mick says that he loves her and they kiss. Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Sonata\\" was watched by 7.47 million viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, making it the 41st most watched episode of the week. Jen Creer of TV Squad appreciated that the finale provided closure, while still \\"keeping things open in case it was continued\\". She praised the character of Logan, and enjoyed the lines written by the writers. Creer said that she would have preferred Mick and Beth staying apart, but felt that because of the series' cancellation, the reunion was a better ending. John Kubicek of BuddyTV noted the \\"brilliant homage\\" with the mention of Hearst College in Veronica Mars, of which Dohring was a regular cast member. Kubicek thought that he would miss Logan most, and hoped that he would see David Blue on another television series.

It is named after Rachel in the Bible, who weeps \\"for her lost children.\\" Rachel's Vineyard is funded by Priests for Life and has a broadly Roman Catholic ethos with a Catholic Mass celebrated as an integral part of the retreat, but also runs non-denominational retreats for non-Catholics. History In 1996, Theresa Karminski Burke started one of the first therapeutic support groups for women who had had abortions. Later, she founded Rachel’s Vineyard, together with her husband, Kevin Burke. Burke's Rachel's Vineyard: A Psychological and Spiritual Journey for Post Abortion Healing (written with Barbara Cullen) was published in 1994 as a support group model for counselors helping women with post abortion grief. Four Rachel's Vineyard retreats were conducted in 1995 and by the end of 2002 over 130 had been held. In 2003, Rachel’s Vineyard was reorganised and became a ministry of Priests for Life, with Frank Pavone as the Pastoral Director. A retreat is generally designed for about a dozen clients and a priest and a licensed therapist are typically present. In June 2002, Burke and David Reardon published a book titled Forbidden Grief, a review of Burke’s experience in counseling women for abortion-related emotional problems. In 2003, Bernadette Goulding founded the Irish chapter of Rachel's Vineyard, and in 2011 founded Women Hurt, a similar organisation, with less focus on Catholicism. As of 2014, Rachel's Vineyard held over 1,000 retreats annually, in 48 U.S. states and 70 countries. Rachel's Vineyard retreats are hosted by church based ministries, counseling outreach programs, Project Rachel offices, Respect Life groups, and crisis pregnancy centers. They are offered in both Catholic and interdenominational settings.

Its plot centers on a trio of snowmobilers in the Canadian Rockies who become stranded at an abandoned hotel where the elderly female innkeeper is hiding an evil entity within the building. The film is inspired by the Windigo legend of North America. Filmed in Banff, Alberta under a tax shelter in December 1980, the film had an unstable financial situation and the filmmakers nearly halted the production mid-way through due to depletion of its budget. The film was given a minuscule theatrical run in Canada and the United States and is consequently little-known among horror film fans, but has attained a cult following over the years. The independent cult label Code Red Releasing later acquired the film, and released in on DVD for the first time in April 2012. In August 2017, they reissued the film on Blu-ray featuring a new 2K scan of the original film elements. Plot Jenny, Marty, and Chrissy are spending their New Year's Eve on a snowmobiling trip in the Rocky Mountains. After talking with a storekeeper at a ski shop, the three decide to go riding before dark, but end up caught in a blizzard. Looming before them is a seemingly abandoned hotel at the top of the snow trail, isolated from tourists and miles away from the skiing area. The three enter the building to escape the increasingly harsh conditions, and find that the heat is on, but there are no lights. As night falls, they start a fire and tell stories and reminisce. Marty decides to go into the hotel kitchen where he finds an old woman lurking. She is brash and apprehensive of their presence, and they learn that she lives in the hotel with two unseen sons. Though hesitant, the woman lodges them in rooms. Marty and Jenny argue in their bedroom, while Chrissy goes down the hallway to take a bath since the plumbing in the rooms is obsolete. While in the bathtub, Chrissy is attacked by one of the sons, Danny, and held underwater. A restless Jenny goes to check on Chrissy, but the candle-lit bathroom is empty; Jenny then runs into the old woman and they have a conversation about the hotel and her sons. Meanwhile, Danny carries Chrissy to the basement of the hotel, where he slits her throat and then stores her body in a freezer. Jenny awakens in the night and hears the old woman talking to someone downstairs. The next morning, Marty goes outside to the snowmobiles to activate them, with no success. Suspecting that they have been tampered with, he goes outside to an old shed for tools, while Jenny stays in the kitchen with the old woman. After accepting the tea from the offering woman, Jenny inquires about Chrissy's disappearance, but the old woman is evasive. Jenny returns to a lounge in the hotel where she realizes she's been drugged, and falls unconscious. She awakens in the basement, where she finds a book on Native American folklore and reads that a Wendigo is often \\"kept\\" by an old woman who had the power passed on to her from another. She opens the freezer and discovers a human Windigo inside, being the old woman's second son. Danny then comes down to the basement with a chainsaw and chases Jenny throughout the hotel, up into the attic. Jenny exits through a window onto a small balcony; she manages to push him over, where he is impaled on an iron fence below. Jenny finds Marty outside, who appears to be possessed and rambling to himself while wandering into the woods. Meanwhile, the storekeeper arrives at the hotel, where he is stabbed by the old woman. Jenny re-enters the hotel, where she finds Danny's body has been dragged into the foyer. She locates a shotgun in a storage room, and is confronted by the old woman, who claims that she is Jenny's deceased mother. Jenny shoots and kills her. Strangely overtaken, she visits the Wendigo in the freezer where she says that she \\"will look after you now.\\" and finds Marty's body outside with no reaction. In the end, Jenny sits in a lounge chair in front of a fireplace as the old woman's voice is heard. Cast *Riva Spier as Jenny *Murray Ord as Marty *Sheri McFadden as Chrissy *Georgie Collins as Ghostkeeper *Les Kimber as Storekeeper *Bill Grove as Danny (credited as Billy Grove) *John MacMillan as Windigo Production Casting The majority of the cast of Ghostkeeper were locally-hired actors in the Calgary area, with the exception being lead Riva Spier, who was an actress hired out of Montreal. For the majority of the cast, Ghostkeeper was their first and final film credit; Georgie Collins was primarily a well- known stage actress in Calgary, and was cast in the role of the mysterious elderly hotel proprietor. Murray Ord went on to become a successful film producer in later years. Filming Deer Lodge in Banff, Alberta served as a primary filming location. Ghostkeeper was filmed on location in Lake Louise and the Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. Filming began on November 30, 1980, and finished on December 23, 1980. The film was photographed by cinematographer John Holbrook. Producer Harry Cole commented during the shoot: \\"It's a producer's dream— it has one location in a controlled environment.\\" Cole also described film as more a \\"suspense movie\\" along the lines of Psycho (1960). Ghostkeeper was produced via a tax shelter on a budget of approximately CA$750,000–850,000. Its tax shelter funding made the production's financial situation rather unstable; James Makichuk said that he was given the option of halting the film's production when the funding began to run low, but he pursued to finish the film anyway— According to Makichuk, prior to the depletion of the budget, his original intention was to film a much longer ending, including an extended chase sequence with Spier and the Wendigo creature on the rooftop of the Deer Lodge hotel. Music The film's score was composed by Paul Zaza, who also composed music for fellow Canadian slasher film productions Prom Night (1980), My Bloody Valentine (1981), and Curtains (1983). Zaza got on board due to the involvement of film editor Stan Cole. In fact, some of the musical themes featured in Ghostkeeper were also used in Prom Night. Alternate opening An alternate opening to the film was shot by distributors two years after the initial production. In the opening, a young man fleeing from the hotel at sunlight and running into the woods until backing up against a tree. While pinned, he is killed (presumably by Danny) and stabbed from a sharp wood stake. This opening was not featured in the 1986 VHS. Release Ghostkeeper was to screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1981. It subsequently had its North American theatrical premiere at Calgary's Tivoli Theater on March 3, 1982. Critical response Rosemary McCracken of the Calgary Herald commented on the film's screenplay, noting that it carries \\"distinct echoes of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining,\\" adding that \\"despite the flaws in the script, the film has a fair bit going for it. The performances are a notch above those being offered in much of the American horror fare being served up in our theaters.\\" Of contemporary reviews, the horror film website The Terror Trap gave the film a positive review stating, \\"Not for all tastes, the methodically paced Ghostkeeper is an exercise in disciplined mood generation; its bare claustrophobia either works for the viewer or not. But for those who prefer their chills straightforward, pre-sneer and pre-sarcasm, Keeper can be a most rewarding snow trap\\". J.A. Kerswell from Hysteria Lives! gave the film a negative review calling the film \\"flawed\\", and \\"muddled\\". In The Blockbuster Entertainment Guide to Movies and Videos (1999), the film was rated two-and-a- half stars out of five, deemed \\"an absurd thriller.\\" Eric Cotenas of DVD Drive-In noted the film's prominent atmosphere and drew comparisons to Stephen King's The Shining as well as cinematographer John Holbrook’s \\"aesthetic response to the desolate location.\\" Home media The film did not receive a home video release until September 1986. The film was released on VHS in September 1986 through New World Pictures' home video branch. Director James Makichuk stated in an interview that he was trying to get a DVD released through Netflix with a quality print of the film. In April 2012, Ghostkeeper was released for the first time on DVD through Code Red Releasing. The DVD included a commentary with James Makichuck, Riva Spier and Murray Ord, an interview with director of photography John Holbrook as well as an interview with actress Georgie Collins. The film is presented in 1.78.1 anamorphic widescreen for the first time on video and has been restored from the only known existing film elements. On August 18, 2017, Code Red issued a Blu-ray edition of the film featuring a new 2K scan of the original film elements.

VOKS (an acronym for the Russian \\"Vsesoiuznoe Obshchestvo Kul'turnoi Sviazi s zagranitsei\\" — Всесоюзное общество культурной связи с заграницей, All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries) was an entity created by the government of the Soviet Union in 1925 to promote international cultural contact between writers, composers, musicians, cinematographers, artists, scientists, educators, and athletes of the USSR with those of other countries. The organization conducted tours and conferences of such cultural workers. Although of Soviet origin, VOKS was in fact an international organization, with parallel national branches around the world, such as the \\"American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia\\" (established 1926) and the \\"Society for Polish-Soviet Friendship\\" (established 1944). VOKS was frequently criticized by Western government officials, public intellectuals, and the press for functioning as a de facto communist propaganda organization. VOKS was restructured and renamed in 1958, replaced by a new so-called \\"friendship organization\\" known as the \\"Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries,\\" which continued to exist until 1992. Organizational history Establishment and structure Olga Davidovna Kameneva, sister of Leon Trotsky, was the first chief of VOKS, holding the post of chair (predsedatel) from 1925 until 1930. VOKS, the All- Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, was established in Moscow in 1925 as a mechanism to coordinate cultural contact between Soviet cultural workers and intellectuals and their peers in the capitalist countries of the West. Planning for the organization seems to have begun in May 1925, with a formal constitution for the society approved by a decree of the Council of People's Commissars dated August 8 of that same year.O.D. Kameneva, \\"Cultural Rapprochement: The U.S.S.R. Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries,\\" Pacific Affairs, vol. 1, no. 5 (Oct. 1928), pg. 6. According to this formal public document, VOKS was intended \\"to cooperate in the establishment and development of scientific and cultural relations between institutions, public organizations and individual scientific and cultural workers in the USSR and those of other countries.\\" VOKS was subdivided by field of interest into a number of sections, including a Literary Section concentrating upon publishers and authors; a Musical and Theatrical Section for composers, musicians, actors, and playwrights; a Cinema Section for cinematographers and those concerned with film production; a Juridical Section dealing with matters of interest to jurists; and an Exhibition Section to deal with the presentation of international expositions relating to art and literature.Kameneva, \\"Cultural Rapprochement,\\" pg. 7. VOKS also maintained a Press Department, which published an organ called the Weekly News Bulletin in Russian, English, French, and German.Kameneva, \\"Cultural Rapprochement,\\" pg. 8. Official function The organization had both international and domestic functions, managing the activities of a growing number of \\"societies of friends of the Soviet Union\\" around the world as well as gathering information about cultural trends in the West and sponsoring direct contract between Soviet and non-Soviet cultural workers and intellectuals.Michael David-Fox, \\"From Illusory 'Society' to Intellectual 'Public': VOKS, International Travel and Party-Intelligentsia Relations in the Interwar Period,\\" Contemporary European History, vol. 11, no. 1 (Feb. 2002), pg. 10. From its earliest days VOKS coordinated cultural, scientific, and literary exchanges and was the organization which frequently received prominent visitors to the Soviet Union from the West and arranged their contacts with Soviet peers. Inside the USSR, the organization facilitated the importation and translation of foreign scientific and literary texts and organized public presentations by artists and scholars returning from trips to the West. The society also helped with currency transfers to enable Soviet scholars to join foreign academic societies, expedited the acquisition of travel visas, and assisted with the difficult process of receiving foreign books and journals through the USSR's tight net of internal censorship. Although officially launched by the Council of People's Commissars and maintaining close connections with both the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs and the secret police, VOKS consistently maintained the pretext of being an independent \\"society\\" rather than an official appendage of the Soviet state apparatus.David-Fox, \\"From Illusory 'Society' to Intellectual 'Public,'\\" pg. 11. This semi-independent status was accentuated by the inclusion of significant numbers of non-Party intellectuals within its membership ranks. Propaganda function As part of its propaganda efforts, VOKS published a Weekly News Bulletin in Russian, English, German, and French which featured stories about the positive achievements of Soviet medicine, literature, art, and science. A key aspect of VOKS was its ability to put forward articulate intellectuals to defend the Russian revolution and the Soviet system in an international setting. VOKS-sponsored scientists, artists, and educators reached the general public through lectures, exhibitions, and other forms of public interaction, and were also instrumental in maintaining Moscow's influence over the network of so-called \\"friendship societies\\" across Europe and around the world, putting a learned and cultured face on a sometimes brutal revolutionary reality. VOKS sponsored artistic exhibitions, cultural exchanges, concerts, tours, lectures, and sporting events which helped to cast the USSR in a positive and humane light. The society also published travel guides in English, German, and French and made efforts to solve problems and expedite contacts for foreigners traveling in the Soviet Union.David-Fox, \\"From Illusory 'Society' to Intellectual 'Public,'\\" pg. 13. The successes and prestige of VOKS abroad seem to have additionally had a positive impact on shaping the attitudes of the Soviet intelligentsia during the 1920s, building support among the sometimes feisty artistic community for the new regime. The organization also served as an effective front for the Soviet Union's foreign intelligence operations, as historian Svetlana Chervonnaya notes: > However, VOKS also often served as a convenient 'roof' for operations of > both branches of Soviet intelligence, whose residents and operatives used > opportunities provided by VOKS to establish and maintain contacts in > intellectual, scientific and government circles. These contacts were, for > the most part, unaware that they were dealing not with 'cultural > representatives' and diplomats, but with intelligence officers. Leadership The leading figure in VOKS from the time of its establishment until 1930 was Olga Kameneva, the sister of prominent Bolshevik Leon Trotsky and wife of Soviet leader Lev Kamenev. Kameneva was followed in 1930 by Fedor Nikolaevich Petrov, a college educated Old Bolshevik who had worked previously in the Soviet bureaucracy in the Main Directorate for Scientific, Artistic, Museum, Theatrical, and Literary Institutions and Organizations (Glavnauka), part of the People's Commissariat for Education. In 1934 Petrov was replaced as head of VOKS by Alexander Arosev, a writer and former Ambassador to Czechoslovakia who was a longtime acquaintance of Joseph Stalin's right-hand man, V.M. Molotov. Arosev would run afoul of the secret police in 1937 during the Terror of 1937-38. He was replaced by Viktor Fedorovich Smirnov, who remained as head of VOKS until 1940. Viktor Smirnov would be followed by just three other chairs of VOKS and its successor organization during the entire decades of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and the first half of the 1970s — Vladimir Kemenov (1940 to 1948), Andrei Denisov (1948 to 1957), and Nina Popova (1957 to 1975). VOKS in the 1950s By 1957 so-called \\"friendship societies\\" had been established in 47 countries, all of which were coordinated by VOKS.Svetlana Chervonnaya, \\"VOKS,\\" Documents Talk: A Non-definitive History, 2008, www.documentstalk.com/ In America, VOKS gained new notoriety in the 1950s when U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy accused journalist Edward R. Murrow of colluding with the organization on the CBS television program See It Now. From VOKS to SSOD In 1958, VOKS was reorganized as a new entity called the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Contacts (SSOD). The new SSOD continued to fulfill the role previously played by VOKS until it was disbanded in 1992, in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December of the previous year. An official government agency for international cultural affairs followed in the post-communist period, called since 1994 the \\"Russian Center for International Scientific and Cultural Cooperation of the Government of the Russian Federation.\\" Overseas counterparts Society for Cultural Relations (UK) Known as the SCR, the Society for Cultural Relations between the Peoples of the British Commonwealth and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics was founded in London in 1924 by leading intellectuals of the time. It may have served as a prompt for the USSR to found VOKS in response to their initiative. OBJECTS OF THE S.C.R. 1\\\\.

It is considered to be the spiritual successor to Slap Fight. Based around a video game within a video game concept, players assume the role of a young secret agent assigned by the government taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft in an attempt to defeat the titular virtual reality simulator, rescue the abducted players who lost against it and unveil its true purpose. Headed by DonPachi producer Kenichi Takano, Grind Stormer was created by a small development team of new employees at Toaplan who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 and was originally titled Bakuretsu Wing before being ultimately renamed to V・V in Japan. It is notable for marking the debut of Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda in the video game industry, serving as one of its programmers and features a much smaller hitbox for the ship compared with previous shoot 'em up games released at the time. It is also notable for being one of the last games by Toaplan to feature an FM soundtrack, as the company began to clear out their FM chip inventory. Initially launched for the arcades, the game was later ported to the Sega Genesis by Tengen and first published in Japan on 25 March 1994 and a month later in North America, featuring both the original Japanese and North American versions as selectable gameplay modes. Grind Stormer proved to be popular in arcades but the game has been met with mixed reception from critics and reviewers alike since its release on the Genesis, who felt divided in regards to several aspects such as the presentation, visuals, sound design and gameplay. It has been regarded by some to be an early example of a manic shooter. As of 2019, its rights are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.  Gameplay  Arcade screenshot Grind Stormer is a science fiction-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game where players assume the role of a young secret agent assigned by the government taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft through six stages in an effort to defeat the titular VR game, rescue the abducted players who lost against it and unveil its true purpose as the main objective. As far as vertical scrolling shooters go, the game initially appears to be very standard but the power-up and scoring systems change depending on the version being played;Grind Stormer manual (Sega Genesis, US) In Grind Stormer, players have the normal weapon layout with instant power-ups and bomb icons. This version also has speed-up icons as well as speed-down icons, and higher value point items. In V・V, however, the players collect gems that allow them to choose between multiple weapons through a power meter system reminiscent of Gradius and Slap Fight instead, removing the bombs and weapon icons completely. This version also has a shield power-up not featured in the former version as well. Each version of the game features three types of weapons to choose from: Shot, Search and Missile. Shot is the standard vulcan weapon players start with at the beginning and can fire in different directions depending on their arrangement, however the ship's firepower increases into one large beam when the options are focused and held on at close range. Search is a satellite-only weapon that turns the options into homing devices that seek out any enemies on the screen (even if they were invulnerable), and changes the ship's color into light violet once equipped. Missile, as the name implies, fires non-homing rockets with a high firing rate and power, while the options follow the ship in the \\"snake\\" or \\"shadow\\" style, though the item will turn the ship's color into blue once equipped. In some occasions, players can pick up point icons that constantly changes its value as well as a 1UP icon. Similar to Dogyuun and Gun Frontier, the game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives. The title uses a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's firepower to its original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. As with previous shoot 'em ups from Toaplan, the game loops back to the first stage after completing the last stage, with the second loop increasing in difficulty and enemies fire denser bullet patterns as well as spawning extra bullets when destroyed (sometimes called 'suicide bullets' or 'ricochet effect'). Defeating the second loop results in achieving the true ending.  Plot  The plot summary of Grind Stormer varies between each version. In the original arcade versions, the game is based around a video game within a video game concept and takes place in the year 2210, where 'the ultimate arcade machine' called Grind Stormer/V・V has finally been released to the public. A VR shooting game, it became so addictive that the government assigned a young secret agent to investigate the arcade phenomenon in order to question its true purpose and to perform the impossible: to beat the game by taking control of the NA-00 space fighter craft, as those who played and lost against it were abducted as a result. In the Sega Genesis version, players assume the role of the last surviving Terran Defense Force fighter pilot taking control of the titular fighter craft in order repel an alien race known as the Zeta Reticulli from invading Earth.  Development  PCB Grind Stormer was created by a small team of new employees at Toaplan, who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994, and was originally titled Bakuretsu Wing before being ultimately renamed to V・V in Japan. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Gaming.moe. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Its development was helmed by director Kenichi Takano, with artists Mikio Yamaguchi and Yusuke Naora acting as graphic designers, while composer Masahiro Yuge wrote the soundtrack. (Translation by Gamengai. ). Guardian and Twin Cobra artist Kōetsu Iwabuchi also served as the project's planning manager. Cave co-founder Tsuneki Ikeda served as one of the game's programmers in his first video game role prior to Batsugun and DonPachi alongside Seiji Iwakura and he has recounted about Grind Stormer's development process in various interviews across publications such as Monthly Arcadia. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Ikeda stated that the project was conceived as a \\"training exercise\\" for the small team, as they received a sample game program containing basic elements from the shoot 'em up genre to work with, which served as a basis to add other elements and Ikeda clamied that the project was pitched as a spiritual successor to Slap Fight. However, he stated that the sample program contained a smaller hitbox for the ship and went unnoticed as the team proceeded on making the game. During initial testings at Toaplan, one of the company's senior programmers gave positive feedback in regards to bullet dodging due to the small hitbox and considered it to be better than Truxton II, encouraging Ikeda and the team to work with the format. When developing the game, Ikeda was influenced by Salamander. Yuge taught to the new development crew technical guidance so he could let them develop much of the project on their own and he has since stated on interviews that the reason for composing the soundtrack in FM rather than both it and PCM as with Truxton II was due to the company beginning to clear out their FM chip inventory for business reasons in order to keep PCB manufacturing costs low, despite internal conflicts and served as one of the last releases by Toaplan to feature an FM soundtrack. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Yuge also worked under a memory limit for the sound driver, prompting him to come up with programming tricks to overcome such limit.  Release  Grind Stormer was first released on arcades across Japan and North America in 1993. On 21 May 1993, an album was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon. It was featured on a Japanese TV show.  Sega Genesis  Sega Genesis screenshot Grind Stormer later received a conversion to the Sega Genesis by Tengen and was first published in Japan on 25 March 1994 and later in North America on April of the same year. The Genesis port included both the Japanese (V・V) and North American (Grind Stormer) versions as a 2-in-1 package but has a number of key differences such as having a smaller color palette that lead to sprites being recolored in different ways, along with other presentation and gameplay changes from the original arcade releases. The North American release has since become one of the more expensive titles on the platform, due to manufacturing errors that resulted in a defective cartridge print run as a result, with copies of the port fetching over US$160 on the secondary video game collecting market.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Grind Stormer on their April 15, 1993 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Mystic Warriors and Dark Edge. GamesMaster noted its \\"fast and furious\\" action. According to Masahiro Yuge, Grind Stormer proved to be popular in arcades and exceeded the company's expectations. Den of Geek noted it to be one of the titles from Toaplan which intensively pushed the formula established by their previous endeavors. Reviewing the Genesis version, GamePro remarked that \\"While not as technologically innovative as Star Fox or other top space marauders, Grindstormer is still a colorful, fun, thumb-bustin' good time.\\"  Legacy  Grind Stormer has been regarded by some retrospective reviewers to be an early example of a manic shooter. The rights to the game and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxtons Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

I. Luckenbach (ID-2291) was a cargo ship and troop transport that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919. Construction and early career SS K. I. Luckenbach was built as a commercial cargo ship at Quincy, Massachusetts, by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation for Luckenbach Steamship Company of New York City. Launched on 27 October 1917, she was delivered to Luckenbach in early 1918. The 3rd Naval District inspected her on 11 February 1918 for possible U.S. Navy World War I service; after she spent several months operating under charter to the United States Army, the Navy acquired her on 8 August 1918. Assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 2291, she was commissioned on 9 August 1918 as USS K. I. Luckenbach with Lieutenant Commander James A. McDonald, USNRF, in command. U.S. Navy career Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, K. I. Luckenbach served as a cargo ship, supplying the American Expeditionary Force in France. Between 12 August 1918 and 22 December 1918, she made two round-trip voyages carrying general U.S. Army cargo to France. In December 1918, following her return from the second voyage, K. I. Luckenbach was transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force for postwar use as a troop transport. After conversion into a transport, she made three round-trip voyages in 1919 to assist in returning American troops from France. She debarked her last soldiers at New York City on 14 September 1919. On 16 September 1919, K. I. Luckenbach arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned on 5 October 1919. She was returned to Luckenbach Steamship Company on the day of her decommissioning. Later career The ship resumed commercial service as SS K. I. Luckenbach. Childrens author Howard Pease drew upon his service aboard K. I. Luckenbach for his 1927 novel The Jinx Ship. Midway through 1933, K. I. Luckenbach received press coverage when San Francisco, California, automobile dealer James F. Waters purchased 350 new DeSoto and Plymouth automobiles from the New York distributor and, for publicity purposes, elected to ship them to San Francisco via the Panama Canal, an event that was well publicized by DeSotos sales office. In an article entitled \\"DEALER CHARTERS BOAT TO TRANSPORT 350 CARS; San Francisco De Soto Dealer Receives Cars Via Canal, Automobile Topics reported: :\\"For the first time in the history of automobile business, a boat sailed out of New York Harbor last week flying the house flag of an automobile dealer. It was the K. I. Luckenbach, and from the top of the mast flew the flag of James F. Waters, San Francisco DeSoto-Plymouth dealer who chartered it to carry 350 DeSoto-Plymouth cars to the [United States] West Coast through the canal. :\\"This record shipment of automobiles to a single dealer is further indication of the upward swing in automotive sales in all parts of the country, according to R. M. Rowland, assistant general sales manager of the De Soto Motor Corporation. 'For instance,' Rowland stated, 'since the first of this year [1933] this one distributor alone has sold more than $2,000,000 worth of automobiles in his San Francisco territory. Waters is of the opinion that sales will hold strong even into November and December [1933]. For this reason he has ordered this shipload of cars to protect his customers for immediate delivery.' :\\"It is significant that in San Francisco from January to August of this year [1933], out of the first six cars which led in registrations, four of them were Chrysler Motors products. Plymouth was second is sales for this period.\\" Notes References * *Department of the Navy: Naval Historical Center Online Library of Selected Images: Civilian Ships: S.S. K.I.

Biography Stone was born in England and educated in the United States. His father Lawrence Stone was a noted historian and chair of the History Department at Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey where Robert grew up, graduating Princeton High School in 1976.Mroz, Jacqueline. \\"Sundance Honor for Film of Early Save-the-Earth Activists\\", The New York Times, February 13, 2009. Accessed December 10, 2018. \\"When he was just 11 years old and living in Princeton, Robert Stone borrowed his parents’ Super 8 camera and made his first film, about the pollution he saw around him.... After attending Princeton High School, Mr. Stone studied history in college.\\" He was later educated at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, did a brief stint at Sorbonne University in Paris and at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York. His debut work was the Academy Award-nominated Radio Bikini (1988), about nuclear tests performed around Bikini Atoll in 1946. Robert Stone in 2019 Known in large part for his innovative use of archival material in historical documentaries, Stone has directed several well received documentaries that he has shot himself, including American Babylon (2000) and, most recently, Pandora's Promise (2013), which makes the environmental case for nuclear energy as a solution to climate change. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman stated that Stone \\"may be the most under-celebrated great documentary filmmaker in America.\\" His films Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst (2004) and Oswald's Ghost (2008) both received Emmy nominations for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking; Gleiberman hailed them as \\"two of the most explosively insightful documentaries of the last decade\\". For Earth Days (2009), Stone received a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Documentary Screenplay. His only foray into fiction filmmaking was a counter-factual fake historical documentary for German television called World War Three in 1998. In addition to his work making feature-documentaries, in the early 1990s he was commissioned to create a 24-part semi-interactive permanent installation at the JFK Presidential Library in Boston. His work with environmental issues, particularly the worldwide acclaim surrounding his film Pandora's Promise, led him to co-found the non-profit clean energy advocacy group Energy for Humanity with environmental campaigner Kirsty Gogan and philanthropist Daniel Aegerter. Stone is also one of 18 co-authors of the Ecomodernist Manifesto which challenges conventional thinking about the meaning of sustainable development. Starting in 2017, Stone worked on a 6-hour documentary mini-series for PBS called Chasing the Moon, an epic political and social history of the space race. The film aired in 2019 coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the first lunar landing. He also co-authored a companion book of the same name to be published by Ballantine Books.

It is the time the village gets themselves into a feeling in which they become part of and enjoy the happiness of being part of the glory of Lord Rama. It is the festival where it pictures the great culture merging the normal and common life with great old mythologies. The festival begins in February second week lasting seven days. More than ten theyyams are performed here during the festival. Among them the theyyam named Daivathaar is the most important one. Devotees consider Daivathaar as a channel/medium of Lord Rama. Theyyam depicting bali and sugriva fighting during festival Devotees gathered at the time of festival Worship Being a part of North Malabar, in Andalur kavu Thira (also theyyam or theyaattam) is the main ritual of worship. It is one of the rare places where Yuddha kanda of Ramayana -- the great epic -- is visualised and performed. The main deities are Rama, Lakshmana and Hanuman. One significance for this kavu is that it has two holy places called Mele Kavu (upper temple) and Thazhe kavu (lower temple).https://www.janmabhumidaily.com/news382428 The Thazhe (pronounced as Thuley, but with the tongue touching the roof of the soft palate while saying the \\"l\\") Kavu is a sacred grove which harbors several rare plants species typical of the Myristica swamps, notably Syzygium travancoricum, an endangered endemic plant. Much of the flora of the sacred grove has been lost due to poor regeneration and the disturbance from cattle and human activity in this thickly populated area. Etymology The name Andalurkavu (\\"Andar-villoor- kavu\\") can be interpreted as the grove (sacred kavu) where the sacred weapons of deities are kept. There are interpretations that say this kavu was created by Sree Parasuraman, the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu. There are interesting interpretations behind names of all the other places that surround Andalur like Melur, Palayad and Dharmadam. The Andalur, especially the Andalurkavu is the most divine place for the people in all these areas.

History SS Katrina Luckenbach was built as a commercial cargo ship at Quincy, Massachusetts, by Fore River Shipbuilding Corporation for Luckenbach Steamship Company of New York City. Launched on 11 February 1918, she was delivered to Luckenbach in 1918. Soon after her delivery, the U.S. Navy acquired her from Luckenbach on 18 May 1918 for World War I service under a bareboat charter. Assigned Identification Number (Id. No.) 3020, she was commissioned on the day she was acquired as USS Katrina Luckenbach with Lieutenant Commander Eldon H. Read, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Katrina Luckenbach departed New York City on 10 June 1918, under the command of Lieutenant Bird Henry Stearns, with a cargo of United States Army supplies for American forces in France. She returned to the United States on 16 August 1918, then underwent repairs. The war ended on 11 November 1918, before her repairs were complete. In December 1918, Katrina Luckenbach was transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force for postwar use as a troop transport to assist in returning American troops from Europe. After conversion into a transport, she departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 June 1919 with cargo for France. Upon her return to New York, Katrina Luckenbach was decommissioned on 25 November 1919 and was returned to Luckenbach the same day.

Lowenthal also served on the Long Beach City Council prior to her service in the Assembly. Lowenthal unsuccessfully ran for Mayor of Long Beach in 2014, failing to get past the primary nominating election, earning 19% of the vote. Legislative accomplishments Lowenthal has authored several bills that have been signed and adopted into law since arriving in the Assembly. Most notable are her bills that deal with job creation, government reform, health, public safety and the environment. Specific bills signed into law include AB 361: Workers Compensation Preauthorization Denials, which prohibits an insurance company that provides workers’ compensation coverage from rescinding or modifying and authorization for medical services after the services are rendered. This bill states that if a company tells a doctor to provide services, then it has to pay for those services; AB 2098 (Miller/Lowenthal): Riverside County Transportation Commission, which clears away legal hurdles to a design-build improvement project on the Riverside (91) Freeway. The project, funded entirely without state general fund money, promises 18,000 jobs throughout the region; AB 1749: Whistleblower Protection; which gives employees of the Judicial Branch of the State the same level of protection against retaliation for reporting wrongdoing as is currently afforded to other employees of the state bureaucracy; AB 2199: Repeal of Discriminatory Language, which strikes out a provision in the California Welfare and Institutions code that requires mental health officials to find the “causes and cures of homosexuality.” That law was written in 1950 and AB 2199 strips that discriminatory language from the books; AB 2435: MFT Elder Abuse Training, recognizes that Mental health care providers are key to stopping elder and dependent adult abuse and helping families in crisis. This bill requires MFTs, psychologists, LCSWs, and Licensed Professional Clinical Counselors to have training in the recognition and reporting of suspected elder and dependent adult abuse. Current Legislation Lowenthal's current legislation is a mix containing transportation, health and government reform bills including; AB 312: Violence Against the Homeless, which recognizes that Violence against the homeless has substantially risen over the past decade. This bill would specify that a homeless person has the civil right to be free from violence or intimidation, and, most importantly, it would state that if they are attacked simply for being homeless, they would be able to sue their aggressor for enhanced civil damages. It would shift the cost of protecting the homeless onto the backs of those who would seek to harm them; AB 739: Mental Health Curriculum, which would require the State Board of Education to include suicide prevention instruction as part of health education for grades 7 through 12; AB 960: Electronic Waste, which would require electronic waste recyclers to take other electronic waste and devices in addition to the covered products. Pre Assembly political career Prior to her service in the Assembly, Lowenthal was elected to represent the First Council District of the City of Long Beach, in 2001, and was selected to serve as Vice Mayor in 2006. Lowenthal also served on the Long Beach Unified School District Board of Education for seven years and was a member of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), as well as many community boards and committees. Background Assembly member Lowenthal received her Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin (class of 1961) and a Master's of Science in Community and Clinical Psychology from Cal State Long Beach (class of 1974). Since 1975, Lowenthal has been a licensed family counselor and mental health consultant. She has also served as a bilingual mental health consultant for the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), HeadStart, and the Centro de la Raza, Personal Assembly member Lowenthal was previously married to California State Senator Alan Lowenthal—who was also one of her predecessors in her current Assembly seat.

The organization was founded in 1985 by California Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Its chief officers include President Jamie Court and Executive Director Douglas Heller. Other notable staff include consumer advocate John Simpson. Early history After lobbying with consumer advocate Ralph Nader on a number of issues including campaign finance reform and nuclear power proliferation, Rosenfield founded Consumer Watchdog in 1985. Later, Rosenfield and Nader campaigned against California Proposition 51 (1986), an insurance- industry-backed initiative on the California ballot in 1986 that limited damage claims on lawsuits. Though Proposition 51 passed, Rosenfield continued to work for insurance rate reductions at his newly formed public interest group. Rosenfield believed insurance regulation was the only solution to rising insurance rates in California. In response, Rosenfield drafted new insurance reform legislation, which insurance industry lobbyists defeated in the state capital. Issues Insurance reform =Proposition 103= In 1987, Rosenfield began to write a ballot box proposal to regulate California property and casualty insurance companies and formed a campaign to sponsor it called Voter Revolt. The proposal turned into insurance reform Proposition 103 and promised voters a minimum 20% rollback in rates for property, auto and other kinds of insurance. The measure required auto insurers to base auto insurance premiums primarily on a policyholder's driving safety record, annual mileage driven and years driving experience. Proposition 103 also made the California Insurance Commissioner an elected official, subjected insurers to California's antitrust laws, civil rights laws and unfair business competition law. It also included a provision for \\"intervenor fees,\\" which has resulted in payments to Rosenfield and his organizations of more than $6 million. Voter Revolt operated on a $2.9 million budget, a fraction of the insurance industry's $63 million lobbying and advertising effort. The insurance industry, fearing they would not be able to defeat Proposition 103, launched three competing initiative measures in an attempt to confuse voters. To bring attention to his cause, Rosenfield used publicity stunts like having guards accompany him while he delivered the signatures that got Proposition 103 on the ballot. As well, the group attempted to deliver truckloads of cow manure to the headquarters of Farmers Insurance Group of Los Angeles.Wells, p1Muir, p2 Following this campaign, along with canvassing and the endorsement of Ralph Nader, the initiative was passed in November 1988. Since then, Consumer Watchdog has defended Proposition 103 from insurance industry challenges and ensured the proposition's implementation. In 2008, the Consumer Federation of America estimated that Proposition 103 had saved consumers over $62 billion since 1988. =Proposition 17= During 2010, Consumer Watchdog opposed Proposition 17, a ballot measure sponsored by Mercury Insurance Group to repeal a provision of Proposition 103 which prohibits insurance companies from considering a driver's history of prior insurance coverage when determining the price or availability of automobile insurance. Mercury spent $16 million in its effort, funding a group called Californians for Fair Automobile Insurance Rates. Consumer Watchdog argued that the measure would have allowed Mercury and other companies to impose surcharges on drivers who have not had continuous coverage. To raise awareness of the fact that an insurance company was sponsoring of Proposition 17, Consumer Watchdog sent a man in a chicken suit to legislative hearings on the measure. The group was outspent 12-to-1, but the measure was narrowly defeated on June 8, 2010. Healthcare reform =HMO patients' rights= In 1994, during the Clinton healthcare debate, Consumer Watchdog created Californians for Quality Care and appointed Jamie Court to lead the campaign. In 1996, Consumer Watchdog worked to have the first Patients' Bill of Rights proposition in the US placed on the California ballot. However, Proposition 216 failed to pass, garnering only 38.7% of the vote. In 1998, Consumer Watchdog advocated for legislation, ultimately signed into law by California Governor Gray Davis, to extend broad need rights to HMO patients. To bring attention to the issue, the group dumped a truck load of pinto beans at an HMO industry conference to emphasize Consumer Watchdog's opposition to HMO \\"bean counters\\" overriding doctors' decisions. Most of the legislative package later passed with the help of the California Nurses Association in November 1998. Many of the provisions of California's bill were included in the national U.S. Patients' Bill of Rights act, which passed Congress in 2001. =Prescription drug costs= During the 2004 election, Consumer Watchdog chartered two private trains, which they called \\"the Rx Express\\", to take seniors to Canada to buy cheaper prescription medication. The group wanted to show how Americans pay about 60 percent more for prescription drugs than people in other countries. The Rx Express train trips generated more than three hundred television appearances, with a Nielsen audience of 65 million, 60 newspaper articles, and 100 radio interviews. The provision of prescription drug benefits to seniors became a central issue in the election and ultimately translated to an expansion of Medicare. In 2009, Consumer Watchdog launched with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa the LARx Prescriptions Savings Card Program, a citywide card program that provides discounts on all pharmaceutical medications and is open to all interested individuals with eligibility restrictions. Consumer Watchdog developed the program with the City of Los Angeles. =HMO care for new mothers= Consumer Watchdog lobbied Congress to ban what the group called “drive-through deliveries,” hospitals forcing mothers to be discharged after 8 hours. The group exposed a Kaiser Permanente memo to the media, which displayed controversial remarks about why newborn mothers should be discharged in that amount of time. A number of news agencies picked up on the story, and congressional hearings followed. Congress later passed a law requiring that newborns and their mothers not be discharged from the hospital any sooner than forty-eight hours without their consent. Energy regulation In 1998, the group co-sponsored Proposition 9, a ballot initiative to block aspects of the utility deregulation laws passed by California lawmakers in 1996. Proposition 9 failed following a $40 million opposition campaign, funded largely by California's three major private utilities – Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Edison International and Sempra Energy. During the 2000-2001 California electricity crisis, Consumer Watchdog strongly opposed a proposed legislative bailout of the three major utilities. The legislature did not enact the proposed bailout. The group also runs Oil Watchdog, a blog and resource library about the practices of the US oil industry. Leading up to the 2010 California elections, Oil Watchdog wrote a report exposing what they described as the profit motive of Valero Energy Corporation when it donated $5 million into a ballot initiative, which Consumer Watchdog asserted was aimed at undermining California's green energy industries. The group created a controversial video to expose the practices of Koch Industries, which it displayed in Times Square, New York. Political reform In 2003, Consumer Watchdog launched Arnold Watch to expose what they asserted to be Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's ties to special interests. The group also targeted four Schwarzenegger-backed propositions on the ballot in a special election in 2005. These included California Proposition 74 (2005), which would have lengthened the time it takes for teachers to get tenure, California Proposition 75 (2005), which would have limited public employee unions' political spending, California Proposition 76 (2005), which would have limited California's spending and California Proposition 77 (2005), which the group asserted would have removed lawmakers ability to redistrict the state. All four propositions were defeated, which changed Schwarzenegger's governorship. The group also helped expose what they asserted to be former Senate majority leader Bill Frist’s conflicts of interest. Frist, a doctor whose family controlled HCA, was then backing a Senate bill to limit legal accountability for doctors and hospitals when they commit medical malpractice. The group publicly demanded that Frist sell at least $25 million of stock he held in the company. At the time, HCA was one of America’s largest hospital companies and owner of HCI, the nation’s fifth biggest medical malpractice insurer. Stem cell oversight Consumer Watchdog created Stem Cell Oversight and Accountability Project to lobby for improved benefits to citizens of California from state funded stem cell research. As the Independent Citizen’s Oversight Committee debated the intellectual property rules of California Proposition 71 (2004), a successful 2004 ballot initiative that created $3 billion in general obligation bonds to fund stem cell research, Consumer Watchdog lobbied to have language put in the regulations that ensure any cures that result from the research be made available to underserved populations and that the state recoup a portion of the taxpayers' investment. In 2006 Consumer Watchdog, through its attorney the Public Patent Foundation, also challenged three patents held by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) that cover fundamental stem cell lines and techniques.Regalado, Antonio, David P. Hamilton (July 2006). \\"How a University's Patents May Limit Stem-Cell Researcher.\\" The Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on July 24, 2006. The patent office found that none of the patents could stand as they were, but WARF narrowed the claims of all three patents, and the resulting claims were upheld in 2008.Constance Holden for Science Now. March 12, 2008 WARF Goes 3 for 3 on Patents Consumer Watchdog was able to appeal on only one of the patents, and it did so, and in 2010 the appeals board decided that the amended claims of the patent were not patentable.Stephen G. Kunin for Patents Post Grant. May 10, 2010 BPAI Rejects WARF Stem Cell Patent Claims in Inter Partes Reexamination Appeal However, WARF was able to re-open prosecution of the case and did so, amending the claims again to make them more narrow, and in January 2013 the amended claims were allowed.United States Patent And Trademark Office.

Patent 7,029,913 Decision on Appeal In July 2013, Consumer Watchdog announced that it would appeal the decision to allow the claims of the '913 patent to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), the federal appeals court that hears patent cases.GenomeWeb staff, July 03, 2013 Consumer Watchdog, PPF Seek Invalidation of WARF's Stem Cell Patent At a hearing in December 2013, the CAFC raised the question of whether Consumer Watchdog had legal standing to appeal; the case could not proceed until that issue was resolved.Antoinette Konski for Personalized Medicine Bulletin. February 3, 2014 U.S. Government and USPTO Urges Federal Circuit to Dismiss Stem Cell Appeal Privacy =Financial privacy= Consumer Watchdog lobbied for financial privacy legislation in 2002. The legislation, which required consumers to opt in before financial services companies shared their personal information with other companies, had public support, but lawmakers wouldn’t move it forward. The group wanted to expose how much personal information was for sale on the Internet for a relatively cheap price. To prove their point, the group published the partial Social Security numbers of legislators opposed to financial privacy on his website. Following this campaign, and the signature gathering help of E-Loan's Chris Larsen, Governor Davis signed the \\"country's toughest financial privacy legislation.\\" =Google and internet privacy= Funded by the Rose Foundation for Communities and the Environment, Consumer Watchdog's \\"Inside Google\\" is an initiative which aims to educate the general public \\"about the need for greater online privacy, and to hold Google accountable for tracking consumers online without explicit permission and for exhibiting its monopolistic power in dangerous ways.\\" Consumer Watchdog has also campaigned for \\"do not track\\" rights. The consumer group was recognized by David Vladeck, the consumer protection chief at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, during an online privacy conference on December 1, 2010 in Washington DC.http://www.consumerwatchdog.org/sites/default/files/resources/cw- conferencetranscript.pdf That morning Vladeck announced that the FTC would recommend that every browser come equipped with a \\"do not track me\\" function that prevents companies from collecting data against the user's will. The group campaigned to against what it described as privacy issues with Google, in a series of online videos in 2008. The first asserted that new functions in the Google Chrome web browser transmitted information to the company for tracking purposes. The second asserted that Google was reading emails in its Gmail system, to market to consumers based on contents. Google later agreed to fix the privacy problems in its Chrome browser, which it claimed were inadvertent, as well as other, larger privacy changes. In November 2009 Google launched a dashboard offering consumers better knowledge of and control over their information on Google¹s various services. In January 2010 the company began offering SSL encryption using the HTTPS protocol as the default mode for its Gmail service. In May the company began offering an encrypted SSL connection for its search engine as an option. In 2011, Google entered into an overhaul of its privacy policies in a settlement with the FTC that addressed many of the privacy issues Consumer Watchdog has raised.https://www.washingtonpost.com/rw/WashingtonPost/Content/Epaper/2011-03-31/Ax16.pdf In 2010, to bring attention to Google's privacy issues, Consumer Watchdog checked networks in California Representative Jane Harman's home to see if her unencrypted Wi-Fi network might have been tapped when the company captured images for the Google Streetview service of Google Maps. In the summer of 2010, the organization launched a video in Times Square portraying Google chief executive Eric Schmidt as an exploitative ice cream salesman. The cartoon led to criticism of Consumer Watchdog by some in the technology industry media. In 2011, the group created another video of Schmidt in an effort to get him to testify in front of Congress about what they asserted to be Google’s privacy issues. In 2011, Consumer Watchdog issued a report, \\"Lost in the Cloud: Google and the US Government\\", filled with details obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and interviews. The report claimed that Google has \\"inappropriately benefited\\" from close ties to the government. It also alleged that Google's influence with the Obama Administration, the US Department of Homeland Security, Federal Communications Commission, NASA, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the US Department of Defense, and the US National Security Agency has helped shield Google, and caused what they described as insufficient Federal government action on Google’s Wi-Fi privacy infringements.http://insidegoogle.com/wp- content/uploads/2011/01/GOOGGovfinal012411.pdf The report also asked Congress to look into \\"Air Google,\\" asserting that Google executives were granted an inappropriate level of access to NASA'S Moffett Federal Airfield Because of Consumer Watchdog's work, Google allegedly tried to influence the Rose Foundation to halt funding for Inside Google. On June 19, 2015, Google announced it would remove links to nonconsensual pornography (\\"revenge porn\\") on request. Commentators noted that this was not the same thing as implementing a \\"right to be forgotten\\" as the company already has policies in place dealing with sensitive personal data such as social security numbers and credit card numbers. However, Consumer Watchdog subsequently called on Google to extend the right to be forgotten to U.S. users, filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.

Often appearing alongside the show's host Ralph Emery, Shotgun Red was performed by Steve Hall, a musician, comedian and voice artist who was born in Sheldon, Iowa. The puppet, best recognized for his large gray mustache and straw cowboy hat, was discovered by Hall in a Minnesota hobby shop in 1980 who bought it for forty dollars. Hall first used Shotgun Red as the emcee for his band at the time, Southbound '76. After traveling to Nashville to compete in the final round of The Seagram's 7 battle of the bands contest, Hall and Shotgun \\"crashed\\" Ralph Emery's local morning TV show. Emery fell in love with the little puppet and later made him his co- host on Nashville Now. The puppet's popularity led to the duo releasing two albums for RCA Records, Ralph & Red: Songs for Children and Christmas With Ralph & Red (1989). Shotgun Red went on to appear on the television variety show Hee Haw regularly for eight years and host TNN's music video show Country Clips for six years. He appeared at the Grand Ole Opry and the puppet remained a part of Steve Hall's Shotgun Red Band, which operated out of Nashville, aboard the General Jackson Showboat for 15 years and the Nashville Nightlife Dinner Theater. Hall and Shotgun Red were nominated ten times for the Music City News Comedy Act of the Year. Shotgun Red also hosted his very own television show for RFD-TV for four seasons from 2011 to 2014 called \\"The Shotgun Red Variety Show\\". Hall died on December 28, 2018 at the age of 64 in his hometown of Brainerd, Minnesota, where he was taking a trip to go ice fishing. He died of natural causes. Alongside his fiancée \\"Miss Sheila\\" Keeton, Hall started a cooking show on his YouTube channel called \\"Cooking with Shotgun Red\\" which reached over 100,000 subscribers. Since his passing, Miss Sheila and longtime band member and friend Jennifer Bruce have continued the channel.

The device is similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer. It was reputedly invented by a Thai living in the US who adapted a sink sprayer for toilet use.  Description  The shower is a source of water for people who prefer using water rather than other methods of cleansing after defecation or urination. The shower is an alternative for the traditional sources of water for this action, such as the bidet, copper pot or bucket and mug, being more hygienic and compact. There is no contact between the spray of water and the used water drainage. Image:Bum_Gun_Installation.JPGTypical faucet installation Image:Bum_Gun_Detail.JPGFaucet close up Image:Bidee shower.jpgA Finnish model, manufactured by Oras Image:Waldorf Astoria NY bidet shower.jpgA bidet shower at the Waldorf Astoria New York  Usage  The user typically grasps the faucet in the right hand and uses the thumb or forefinger (depending on the trigger location) to aim a spray of water at the anus or genitals to assist cleansing after using the toilet. Prevalence The bidet shower is common in all predominantly Islamic countries and in most parts of Asia where water is considered essential for anal cleansing. This includes India, Nepal, Pakistan, Egypt, China, Iran, Iraq, Maldives, Bangladesh, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Cambodia. In those countries it is commonly installed in Western-style (sitting) toilet installations. In Thailand, it is common in both Western-style toilets and squat toilet installations. It is so ubiquitous that Thai parliamentarians were outraged on learning that the toilets in their new parliament building were not equipped with bidet showers. The bidet shower is similar in intent, if not method of use, to the Japanese washlet-style toilet seats, or so-called \\"electronic bidets\\". Bidet showers are used by Muslims in Muslim countries and all parts of the Arab world as well as in Asia in order to cleanse themselves with water after using the toilet. Here, water is commonly used instead of, or together with, toilet paper for cleaning after defecation. The bidet is common in predominantly Catholic countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing, In Europe, the bidet shower is used for example in Finland and Estonia.\\"Bidets in Finland\\" Bidets are more common bathroom fixtures in many southern European countries. The average American uses 50 pounds (about 22.6 kilograms) of toilet paper each year; every roll is estimated to require 37 gallons (about 140 litres) of water to produce and an additional 1.6 gallons (about six litres) to flush down the toilet. Given the environmental impact of toilet paper and wet wipes, bidets are growing in popularity.

He was born in Pithapuram, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. One focus of his work has been the research of his mentor J. B. S. Haldane. As an author, his name is usually rendered Krishna R. Dronamraju. Biography Education Dronamraju went to M.R. College in Vizianagaram, Andhra University to study botany and earned a bachelor's degree in 1955. He received a master's degree from Agra University in 1957; he studied plant breeding and genetics. When J.B.S. Haldane moved to India in 1957, Dronamraju wrote to Haldane for an opportunity to pursue a research career under his direction at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta. Early in his research career, he discovered the first case of a gene on the human Y chromosome and published a paper in 1960. It was also part of his PhD thesis at the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta. Dronamraju's research with Haldane at the Indian Statistical Institute included many areas. Research contributions Dronamraju's research covers the visits of several species of lepidoptera to different colored flowers of Lantana camara reported the discovery of a species-specific pattern of color preference behavior by pollinating insects. He did research in human genetics in India. In 1966, Dronamraju completed his PhD from the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta. He studied under J. B. S. Haldane. The topic of his doctoral thesis was \\"Genetic Studies of the Andhra Pradesh population\\". Dronamraju's early research in human genetics (and the independent work of L.D. Saghvi at the Tata Cancer Center in Mumbai) eventually led to the foundation of the Indian Society of Human Genetics. Dronamraju received advanced training at University College, London and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, followed by a postdoctoral fellowship in genetics at the University of Alberta. After he moved to the US, he continued research on inbreeding in human populations such as the Amish population in Pennsylvania in collaboration with Victor A. McKusick at Johns Hopkins. He also studied the Seneca Indians in New York State and other populations in the US and Canada. He studied the relationship between fetal mortality and the occurrence of oral cleft defects in families. In recent years, Dronamraju's research focused on the history of genetics and human/medical genetics. He has published several books, especially with reference to the contributions of his mentor J. B. S. Haldane.

Biography Sleeping nymf by Van der Lisse Van der Lisse was born in The Hague. He learned to paint from Cornelis van Poelenburch, and later lived in Utrecht from 1626, alternating between Utrecht and The Hague between 1635 and 1640.Dirck van der Lisse in the RKD He married Petronella van der Hove in 1639 in the Hague, and in 1640 he moved to Utrecht, and in 1642 he moved to Amsterdam, the same year his second son was born, who died in infancy. In 1644 he became a member of the Hague painter's guild (that contained not only painters, but glass makers, chair makers, and book binders, according to Houbraken), and in 1656, he became a city magistrate and helped form the Confrerie Pictura. In 1659-1669 he was mayor of the Hague. Dirk vander Lis Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature Works He has been called \\"Van Poelenburch's best pupil\\", but Houbraken did not mention his teacher at all, and in Van Poelenburch's biography he claimed that his best pupil was \\"Joan vander Lis\\", not Dirk vander Lis. The RKD mentions both Dirck van der Lisse and Jan van der Lijs as being pupils of Van Poelenburch.Jan van der Lijs in the RKD His early paintings were frequently landscapes with nymphs, coming close to the style his master used around 1630, and even sometimes being mistaken for Van Poelenburch's at auctions. However, many displayed a distinctive style, which consisted of emptier, more horizontal compositions. In 1635, he was one of four painters commissioned to work on the Pastor Fido of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, painting one of the main scenes and one of the four subsidiary landscapes. Later in his career, as was common among his contemporaries, he largely abandoned landscapes in favor of the more lucrative business of portrait painting. Despite his apparent success as a painter, his paintings are relatively uncommon in inventories and auction catalogues before about 1640. He is known for Italianate landscapes and historical allegories of the \\"Van Poelenburch School\\". Works previously attributed to Dirck van der Lisse are currently attributed to Van Poelenburch, Herman Saftleven, Emanuel de Witte, Daniel Vertangen, Willem de Heusch and Moyses van Wtenbrouck. Later in life, when he became involved in guild and municipal politics in The Hague, he probably did not paint much in this latter ten years of his life.

The Australian cotton crop became more important to England, which had lost its American sources, and it served as a supply base for Confederate blockade runners. Immigrants from Europe seeking a better life also found Australia preferable to war-torn North America. The Australian public was shocked by the revelation by a turncoat Russian officer, who claimed that a direct engagement was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised by Britain. The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation for launching attacks. Fear of a possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship. Australia became directly involved when the Confederate navy visited in order to repair one of their warships. This led to protests from the Union representative at Melbourne, while the citizenry of nearby Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew. Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally favored the Union or the Confederacy, as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney when news arrived of Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Economics Together, 140 Australians and New Zealanders were veterans of the American Civil War, 100 of whom were native-born. Some of these were originally Americans who came to Australia during the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s. Officers during the war included one who gave Tasmania its first telegraph service, and another officer who mined for gold in Ballarat. Confederate blockade runners occasionally obtained supplies there, despite a historic fear of possible naval attack by Americans, a fear rooted in the actions of American privateers during the War of 1812.Levi p.60 The war also caused the Lancashire Cotton Famine. As a result, Queensland saw a rise in its cotton industry, while the National Colonial Emigration Society in Britain was founded, although it had little ongoing relevance. This came about as a result of so many individuals from northern England being affected by the inability of the Southern United States to ship cotton during the war.Jupp p.301 Once the war ended, little cotton from Southern Australia was imported to England.Dowling p.31 However, in the aftermath of the war some Australians were interested in acquiring the Fiji Islands and their cotton fields.Levi p.58 Another impact was the competition with Canada that Australia and New Zealand had with Irish immigration. The increasing Irish immigration was seen as an economic boon by these antipodean countries. One of the reasons for the increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.Jupp p.451  Imperial Russian Navy  Russian Admiral Andrey Popov During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies against what they saw as their potential enemy, Britain. The Russian blue- water navy was stationed in San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.Heidler, p. 1689 The flagship of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr under Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, officially made a friendly visit to Melbourne in early 1863. According to information passed on to Australian authorities in June 1864, Rear Admiral A.A. Popov had in the first half of the year 1863 received orders and a plan of attack on the British naval ships positioned near the Australian shore. The plan also included shelling and destruction of the Melbourne, Sydney and Hobart coastal batteries.THE RUSSIAN CORVETTE \\"BOGATYR\\" IN MELBOURNE AND SYDNEY IN 1863 retrieved 2009-03-10 The information was attributed to the Polish lieutenant Władysław Zbyszewski of the Bogatyr, who had deserted from service in Shanghai soon after Bogatyr left Australia, and found his way to Paris to join the Polish January Uprising. This information about Popov's plans was forwarded by a fellow Pole, a certain S. Rakowsky. Similar attack orders are known to have been given to the Atlantic squadron under Rear Admiral Lessovsky, that was sent to New York at the same time. CSS Shenandoah James Iredell Waddell Having crossed the Indian Ocean, the CSS Shenandoah arrived in Australian waters on January 17, 1865. Off the coast of South Australia at 39°32'14\\"S and 122°16'52\\" E, her crew spotted an American- made sailing ship named the Nimrod and boarded it. Having ascertained it was an English ship, the Shenandoah left it alone.Thomsen pp.282,283 On January 25, 1865 the Shenandoah made harbor at Williamstown, Victoria, near Melbourne, in order to repair damage received while capturing Union whaling-ships. At seven o'clock in the evening, Waddell sent Lieutenant Grimball to gain approval from local authorities to repair their ship; Grimball returned three hours later saying they were granted permission.Thomsen p.283 The United States consul, William Blanchard, insisted that the Victorian government arrest the Confederates as pirates, but Victoria's governor, Sir Charles Henry Darling, ignored his pleas, satisfied with the Shenandoah’s pleading of neutrality when requesting to be allowed to undertake repairs. Aside from a few fist fights between Americans, there was no direct conflict between the two warring sides in Melbourne.Levi p.61 However, there were eighteen desertions while ashore, and there were constant threats of Northern sympathisers joining the crew in order to capture the ship when it was at sea.Stern p.251 Craig's Royal Hotel The local citizenry expressed great interest in the Confederate ship in Port Phillip Bay. While at Williamstown, James Iredell Waddell, the captain of the Shenandoah and his men participated in several \\"official functions\\" which the local citizens arranged in their honour, including a gala ball with the \\"cream of society\\" at Craig's Royal Hotel in Ballarat and at the Melbourne Club. Thousands of tourists came to see the ship every day, requiring special trains to accommodate them. After being treated as \\"little lions\\", the officers of the Shenandoah later reflected that the best time of their lives was given to them by the women of Melbourne. After leaving Australia, the Shenandoah sailed north into the Pacific Ocean and captured twenty-five additional Union whaling ships before finally surrendering at Liverpool, England in November, 1865. Those surrendering included 42 Australians who had joined the crew at Williamstown; sources differ as to whether the Australians were stowaways or illegally recruited. Waddell did refuse Australian authorities permission to see if Australians were aboard the ship prior to sailing from Williamstown on February 18, 1865. Four Australians were arrested to prevent them from joining the Confederate ships, and Governor Darling allowed the Shenandoah to sail away, instead of firing upon it. Waddell's official report said that on February 18 they \\"found on board\\" the 42 men, and made 36 sailors and enlisted six as marines. One of the original Confederate crewmen, midshipman John Thomson Mason, stated that they just happened to find the stowaways, of various nationalities, and enlisted them outside of Australian waters. He further said one of the stowaways was the captain of an English steamer that was at Melbourne at the time; the Englishman became the captain's clerk.Mason p.326 Assassination of Abraham Lincoln Assassination of President Lincoln The news of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on 14 April 1865 caused demonstrations of sorrow in Sydney. An editorial in Melbourne's \\"The Age\\" newspaper on June 27, 1865 reported that in Sydney the assassination of Lincoln had caused great indignation. There were many Australian sympathisers that wanted to put an end to slavery, a central issue with Lincoln and his Emancipation Proclamation. A memorial service was held in Sydney's Prince of Wales Opera House on Sunday afternoon July 9, 1865. There were strong feelings of anger at public meetings against the killer of Lincoln, a person so dedicated to his country. They figured he was a genius who rose \\"from a log cabin to the White House.\\"Dowling p.24 A public meeting was held in Sydney to express sympathy for Lincoln's death and a meeting of American citizens held on June 26, 1865 had decided to forward a letter of condolence to Mrs. Lincoln, to contribute for a monumental tablet, and wear mourning for a month. There was a letter of sympathy sent to Lincoln's wife from the mayor of the city of Sydney expressing the city's condolences.Seward, p. 348 News of Lincoln's assassination was reported in the Melbourne's \\"The Age\\" on June 24, 1865. In the Melbourne newspapers, editorials were prominent. There was mention in the Melbourne Herald for June 26, 1865 that many of the American houses in town carried their national ensign at half-mast as a mark of respect to the memory of the late President. William Blanchard, the U.S. Consul in Melbourne at the time, on finding out the news of Lincoln's death, caused the consular flag to be kept at half-mast until July 4, 1865. The City Council of Melbourne passed a resolution \\"expressive of its horror and detestation of the atrocious murder of the late Chief Magistrate.\\"words by Blanchard in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward There were other letters of sympathy from Australia. They came from the Polish and Hungarian Refugees in Melbourne dated July 4, 1865; Citizens of the Swiss Republic Residents in New South Wales; Sydney Irish National League, NSW Branch, dated July 22, 1865; and from the mayor of Sydney Municipal Council dated July 17, 1865. Another letter of sympathy came from the town of Geelong in Victoria, addressed to \\"Mrs. Lincoln, Washington, America\\" dated August 22, 1865.Official records of the United States Department of State, Washington D.C., 1867. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln … and the attempted assassination of William H. Seward, secretary of state, and Frederick W.

Aftermath HMVS Cerberus The residents of Melbourne, realising they were vulnerable to attack by others, especially the Russians due to the events during the war, hurried to build coastal defence forts. This included the government of Victoria requesting an ironclad ship to be sent to protect the colony, after the values of ironclads were demonstrated during the American Civil War's Battle of Hampton Roads. The monitor HMVS Cerberus was constructed during the late 1860s, and duly arrived in Victoria in 1871.Gould, p. 271 In 1872 the British government paid the United States $3,875,000 as a result of the assistance provided to CSS Shenandoah and other Confederate ships in Victoria and other ports controlled by Great Britain, after an international jury ruled on the case in Geneva, Switzerland.Jupp p.168 In 1972, the American Civil War Round Table of Australia was founded. Its secretary, Barry Crompton, has the largest library dedicated to the American Civil War outside the United States, with over 4,000 pieces as of 2005.  Self-government  When the six colonies of the Australian continent federated to form a self-governing nation in 1901, Australia favoured the British model of government as they had misgivings about America's powerful postwar \\"monarchical\\" presidency.Jupp p.844 Australians also opposed the importation of \\"coloured labour\\", in part due to fears of a similar civil war breaking out in Australia.Irving p.434Dowling p.73 A further precautionary measure was evident in the addition of the word \\"indissoluble\\" to the Federal Constitution of 1897–1898 in Adelaide, to prevent the \\"political heresy\\" of secession as engaged in by the Confederacy.Irving p.329 See also *History of Australia (1851-1900) References  Footnotes   Bibliography    Category:History of Australia (1851–1900) Category:American Civil War by location Category:Foreign relations during the American Civil War Category:History of Victoria (Australia) Category:Military history of Australia Category:Australia–United States relations Category:1860s in the British Empire Category:1860s in Australia ","title":"Australia and the American Civil War"},{"id":"21545139","text":"Edward Simpson may refer to: *Edward Simpson (naval officer) (1824–1888), officer in the U.S. Navy during the American Civil War and the Spanish–American War *Edward A.

Aftermath of World War I Latgale (Dyneburg), 1919. The decisions of the 1917 congresses and the declaration of independence on November 18, 1918, with Latgale as part of the Latvian state, moved both the military of Latvia as well as local partisans to struggle for the liberation of Latgale. This was a difficult task, given the territorial interests of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Second Polish Republic, and Belarusian People's Republic. On June 10, 1919 the Lithuanian army reached the territory controlled by the partisan (Green Guard).Lesčius, p. 133 Aftermath of World War II A mannequin of a Latvian national partisan in the Latvian War Museum, 2006. Latvian national partisans waged guerrilla warfare against Soviet rule during the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 during World War II, and the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic after the war. Similar anti-Soviet resistance groups fought against Soviet rule in Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus, Poland, Romania and Galicia (Eastern Europe). The Red Army occupied the formerly independent Latvia in 1940-1941 and, after the period of occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany, again in 1944-1945\\\\. As Stalinist repression intensified over the following years, thousands of residents of this country used the heavily forested countryside as a natural refuge and basis for armed anti-Soviet resistance. Resistance units varied in size and composition, ranging from individually operating guerrillas, armed primarily for self- defence, to large and well-organised groups able to engage significant Soviet forces in battle. Background Caught between two powers Latvia had gained her independence in 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire. The ideals of self-determination had taken hold with many people as a result of having established an independent country for the first time in history. Allied declarations such as the Atlantic Charter had offered promise of a post-war world in which Latvia could re-establish itself. Having already experienced occupation by the Soviet regime followed by the Nazi regime, many people were unwilling to accept another occupation.Laar, Mart. War in the Woods: Estonia's Struggle for Survival, 1944-1956, translated by Tiina Ets, Compass Press, November 1992. In the first weeks of Operation Barbarossa Latvia was overrun by German Army Group North. The German advance had been so swift that thousands of Red Army troops had been by-passed without taking them as prisoners. Thousands of Latvians joined partisan units which were organized by Latvian officers in the rear of the Soviet front line. The Latvians now collected the Reds and sometimes fought fierce battles with those who resisted. The national partisans ahead of the German front line took Sigulda on July 2 (two days before the Germans). They secured Alūksne on July 5, but that evening strong Red Army forces, retreating from the Germans, reached the town, and the partisans withdrew without a fight. The next morning the Reds departed, and the partisans re-occupied the town. The Germans occupied Alūksne on July 7. At the village of Mālupe the partisans attacked the headquarters of the 183rd Rifle Division, killing its commander and several staff officers and capturing their supplies and transportation. By July 8 the Red Army had retreated beyond the Latvian border.Mangulis, V. Latvia in the Wars of the 20th Century. CHAPTER IX JULY 1941 TO MAY 8, 1945 . Historia.lv. Preparations for partisan operations in Courland were begun during the German occupation, but the leaders of these nationalist units were arrested by Nazi authorities.Laar, p. 24 Longer-lived resistance units began to form during the last months of the war; their ranks were composed of a good number of Latvian Legion soldiers as well as civilians.Plakans, Andrejs. The Latvians: A Short History, 155. Hoover Institution Press, Stanford, 1995. On 8 September 1944 in Riga, the leadership of the Latvian Central Council adopted a Declaration on the restoration of the State of Latvia.Edgars Andersons, Leonīds Siliņš \\"Latvijas Centrālā padome – LCP\\" — LCP, Upsala 1994 The adoption of the Declaration was an attempt to restore de facto independence to the Republic of Latvia, in hopes of international support and by taking advantage of the interval between changes of occupying powers. The Declaration prescribed that the Satversme is the fundamental law of the restored Republic of Latvia, and provided for establishment of a Cabinet of Ministers that would organise the restoration of the State of Latvia. Some of the most prominent LCC accomplishments are related to its military branch – General Jānis Kurelis group (the so-called \\"kurelieši\\") with Lieutenant Roberts Rubenis battalion which carried out the armed resistance against Waffen SS forces. The partisan operations in Latvia had some basis in Hitler's authorisation of a full withdrawal from Estonia in mid-September 1944—and in the fate of Army Group Courland, among the last of Hitler's forces to surrender after it became trapped in the Courland Pocket on the Latvian peninsula in 1945. After the capitulation of Germany on May 8, 1945 approximately 4000 legionaries went to the forests. Others, such as Waffen SS commanders Alfons Rebane and Alfrēds Riekstiņš escaped to the United Kingdom and Sweden and participated in Allied intelligence operations in aid of the partisans. The ranks of the resistance swelled with the Red Army's attempts at conscription in Latvia after the war, with fewer than half the registered conscripts reporting in some districts. The widespread harassment of disappearing conscripts' families pushed more people to evade authorities in the forests. Many enlisted men deserted, taking their weapons with them. The partisan war There was not any significant support to the national partisans from the West. Most of the agents sent by the Western- British (MI6), American, and Swedish secret intelligence services in a period from 1945 to 1954 (about 25 agents) were arrested by KGB and could not get into contact with partisans. And also this poor support diminished significantly after MI6's Operation Jungle was severely compromised by the activities of British spies (Kim Philby and others) who forwarded information to the Soviets, enabling the KGB to identify, infiltrate and eliminate many Latvian partisan units and cut others off from any further contact with Western intelligence operatives. The conflict between the Soviet armed forces and the Latvian national partisans lasted over a decade and cost at least thousands of lives. Estimates for the number of fighters in each country vary. Misiunas and TaageperaMisiunas, Romuald and Taagepera, Rein. The Baltic States: Years of Dependence, 1940-1990, University of California Press, expanded & updated edition, October 1, 1993. estimate that figures reached between 10,000 and 15,000 in Latvia. The number of active combatants peaked at between 10,000 and 15,000, while the total number of resistance fighters was as high as 40,000.Laar, p. 24 One author gives a figure of up to 12,000 grouped in 700 bands during the 1945–55 decade, but definitive figures are unavailable.Plakans, p. 155 Over time, the partisans replaced their German weapons with Russian ones. The partisan organizations which attempted to unite and coordinate their activities were the Latvian National Partisan Association in Vidzeme and Latgale, the Northern Courland Partisan Organization, Latvian National Partisan Organization in Courland, Latvian Defenders of the Homeland (partisan) Association in Latgale and the \\"Fatherland Hawks\\" in Southern Courland. In some 3,000 raids, the partisans inflicted damage on uniformed military personnel, party cadres (particularly in rural areas), buildings, and ammunition depots. Communist authorities reported 1,562 Soviet personnel killed and 560 wounded during the entire resistance period.Plakans, p. 155 The Latvian national partisans were most active in the border regions. The forests hid the partisan dugouts, their workshops for weapons, their printing presses for leaflets and underground newspapers. Areas where they were most active included Abrene district, Ilūkste, Dundaga, Taurkalne, Lubāna, Aloja, Smiltene, Rauna and Līvāni. In the Northern regions, they had ties with Estonian Forest Brothers. As in Estonia, the partisans were killed off and infiltrated by the MVD and NKVD over time, and as in Estonia, Western assistance and intelligence was severely compromised by Soviet counter- intelligence and Latvian double agents such as Augusts Bergmanis and Vidvuds Šveics.Laar, p. 27 Furthermore, the Soviets gradually consolidated their rule in the cities, help from rural civilians was not as forthcoming, and special military and security units were sent to control the partisans.Plakans, p. 155 The last groups emerged from the forest and surrendered to the authorities in 1957.Laar, p. 27 Decline of the resistance movements To destroy the partisan base of support major deportation took place in March 1949. Most part of supporters were deported and others were forced to join kolkhozs. By the early 1950s, the Soviet forces had eradicated most of the Latvian national resistance. Intelligence gathered by the Soviet spies in the West and KGB infiltrators within the resistance movement, in combination with large-scale Soviet operations in 1952 managed to end the campaigns against them. Many of the remaining national partisans laid down their weapons when offered an amnesty by the Soviet authorities after Stalin's death in 1953, although isolated engagements continued into the 1960s. The last individual guerrillas are known to have remained in hiding and evaded capture into the 1980s, by which time Latvia was pressing for independence through peaceful means. (See The Baltic Way, Singing Revolution) Latvia regained their independence in 1991. Aftermath, memorials and remembrances Many Latvian national partisans persisted in the hope that Cold War hostilities between the West, which never formally recognized the Soviet occupation, and the Soviet Union might escalate to an armed conflict in which Latvia would be liberated. This never materialised, and according to Laar many of the surviving former Forest Brothers remained bitter that the West did not take on the Soviets militarily. (See also Yalta Conference, Western betrayal) As the conflict was relatively undocumented by the Soviet Union (the Latvian fighters were never formally acknowledged as anything but \\"bandits and illegals\\"), some consider it and the Soviet-Latvian conflict as a whole to be an unknown or forgotten war.Kaszeta, Daniel J.

He went to the forest in 1944 as a member of a resistance organization called \\"Don't Serve the Occupant Army\\". Jānis Pīnups never had a Soviet passport and his legal status was nonexistent during the era of Soviet occupation. His hideaway was located in the forest of the Preiļi district, Pelēči parish. In 1995 a new passport of the Republic of Latvia was issued to Jānis Pīnups and he has said that he's waiting for a moment when he can see Riga – capital of once more independent Latvia.Grīnberga Māra, Pēdējā pasaules kara pēdējais mežabrālis // Diena - 1995, May 18 See also *Forest Brothers *Soviet partisans in Latvia *Anti-Soviet partisans *Pēteris Dzelzītis *Kārlis Mūsiņš Notes and references Further reading *Rieber, Alfred J.

Jackson Lee \\"Diamondfield Jack\\" Davis (12 Aug 1863–2 Jan 1949) was pardoned for the 1896 Deep Creek Murders in Idaho and would later strike it rich in Nevada, where he established several mining towns, one named after his nickname \\"Diamondfield\\".Grover, David H. \\"Diamondfield Jack; A Study of Frontier Justice\\" (University of Nevada Press, 1968) States that Davis was born on August 12, 1863. States that little is known about his early life and that he was somewhere in the east in 1879. Life Davis got his nickname when he went west to Silver City, Idaho on the rumor of a diamond strike. The rumor led to nothing but after talking so much about it he got the nickname \\"Diamondfield Jack\\". After the failed prospecting attempt Jack was hired by Sparks-Harrell cattle company on the Idaho-Nevada border. Davis' job was to keep sheepherders off the cattle's land and after a confrontation that led to wounding of a sheepherder named William Tolman. The sheepherders would change their bed every night to a different position so that the head of the bed would be in a different direction; for the cattlemen would shoot at the head of the beds. Davis was on the run. He began working for the cattle company again the next year and almost immediately as he came back to work, two sheepherders were killed in the area where he was working. Davis became the prime suspect for the killings. A magazine was found in the sheepwagon with a diamond drawn in blood by one of the victims. The sheepmen were killed with .44 caliber bullets shot out of a .45 caliber gun. Diamondfield Jack was known to have bought .44 caliber cartridges when the correct ones were not available. As he was heading towards Mexico, Jack was picked up by authorities in Arizona Territory. He was transported back up to Idaho and sentenced to hang on June 4, 1897. The day before his execution date he was reprieved due to the confessions of two other men to the murders. In February 1899 Davis was transferred to the Idaho State Penitentiary where he stayed until December of that year. Davis was then transferred back to a cell in the Cassia County jail. After Davis had exhausted his appeals another execution date was scheduled for July 3, 1901. By the time public opinion had shifted in Jack's favor mostly due to the confessions of James Bower and Jeff Gray and to the easing of tension between sheep and cattle herders. The Board of Pardons extended the execution date to July 17, much to the outrage of state prosecutor and future Idaho Senator William Borah. Three hours before Davis' scheduled execution, word arrived at the Cassia County sheriff that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment. Davis was moved back to the Idaho State Penitentiary in Boise, Idaho until he was finally pardoned on December 17, 1902 by Idaho Gov. Frank W. Hunt. Upon his release Jack moved to Nevada, where he finally struck it rich and established several mining camps in Nevada. In 1949, Diamondfield Jack was killed by a taxi cab as he was walking in Las Vegas, Nevada.http://www.idahohistory.net/OldPenDiamondfield.pdf Legacy An area in the South Hills in present-day Twin Falls County is named after Davis.South Hills/Shoshone Basin/Salmon Creek Falls Subloop See also *List of wrongful convictions in the United States References Further reading *Young, James A., & Abbot Sparks, B.

Minor workers are between 1.3 and 2.5 mm in length, but major workers are much larger. Between the smallest minor and largest major workers there are many intermediate forms. The largest workers can have heads approximately 10 times as large as those of their smallest counterparts. The dry weight of a large major worker can be approximately 500 times as heavy of that of its smallest counterpart. These size-related morphological differences correspond with their division of labor. For example, small, young, minor workers specialize in caring for the larvae but extend their activities as they grow older. Minor workers have yellowish brown to reddish brown bodies. Their mandibles each have five \\"teeth\\" and their antennal scapes are short and do not exceed the posterior margin of the head. Minor workers have rectangular heads with weakly convex posterior margins in full face view Major workers have reddish brown to blackish brown bodies. Their heads are proportionately larger and almost square with convex posterior margin in frontal view. Mandibles of major workers are large and triangular, with an acute apical \\"tooth\\". Their masticatory margins lack distinct \\"teeth\\". Their eyes are relatively small and their antennal scapes are half as long as their heads. Behavior C. diversa forms large colonies which are often found in soil or under rocks. This species preys on small animals such as insects and also collects nectivorous materials. These ants regularly form long columns for foraging and sometimes roof these trails with arcades constructed of soil particles. They use pheromone trails to maintain these lines and if these trails are obstructed it causes chaos and crowding. One study showed that 98% of individuals failed to cross an obstacle in the foraging path and that eventually the column creates a detour around such obstructions.The Response Behavior of Ant Pheidologeton diversus on Encountering an Obstacle Along Its Trail The minors of this species are often observed to be 'hitching a ride' on the large majors so as to save energy while moving along the trail. Differences between Carebara species and real army ants Due to their raids, Carebara species are often compared to army ants, but there are some important differences: * Carebara species have permanent nests, while real army ants have only temporary nests (Dorylus) or form a bivouac with their own bodies (Eciton). * Colonies of real army ants have only one queen, so when she dies, the workers may try to join another colony, or the rest of the colony also dies; Pheidologeton colonies can have many (up to 16) queens. * Carebara species perform a nuptial flight; real army-ant queens have no wings (queens and workers of the Dorylus species are even blind) and mate on soil. * In Carebara species, a new colony is established by a young queen; real army ants establish a new colony by splitting a large colony. * Carebara species not only hunt insects, but also eat fruits and grains. Contradictory reports about aggressivity Pheidologeton species have been described as very aggressive when hunting or defending their nest, but there are contradictory reports about how they react to other ant species: Generally, Pheidologeton species are said to avoid fights with other ant species (a keeper has reported he almost lost his colony to a Lasius niger invasion and watched Pheidologeton evading smaller Pheidole pieli, but a keeper who intentionally kept P. diversus with a Crematogaster species in the same terrarium reported that Pheidologeton workers had attacked and killed Crematogaster workers. Pheidologeton supermajor castes can tear off human skin and can rip out flesh. Range P. diversus is widely distributed from India through Southeast Asia to Taiwan and the Philippines.Discover Life: Pheidologeton diversus Field records of it occurring Japan are limited although it has been found on two very southern points: Okinawa Island and on Chicchi-jima Island. Specimens taken at the Camp Zama U.S. Air Force base in Kanagawa Prefecture are believed to have originated from commercial introduction from Southeast Asia.

One antkeeper who goes by the YouTube name AntsCanada however, has managed to successfully keep a thriving colony of this species, among the other colonies of ants in his collection. It seems not possible to keep real army ants in a formicarium (ant farm) for a longer time because of their nomadic lifestyle, the continuous growth of the colony, and the immense need of food (some army-ant species are also highly selective when it comes to food). In trials performed by zoos and museums, the army-ant colonies died within weeks or months.

It is the largest subspecies of the Australian masked owl, the largest Tyto owl in the world, and is sometimes considered a full species. The subspecific name castanops, meaning “chestnut-faced”, comes from the colouring of the facial disc. It was first described by John Gould (as Strix castanops), who wrote about it in his “Handbook to the Birds of Australia” as: > ”…a species distinguished from all the other members of its genus by its > great size and powerful form. Probably few of the Raptorial birds, with the > exception of the Eagles, are more formidable or more sanguinary in > disposition.\\" > \\"Forests of large but thinly scattered trees, skirting plains and open > districts, constitute its natural habitat. Strictly nocturnal in its habits, > as night approaches it sallies forth from the hollows of the large gum- > trees, and flaps slowly and noiselessly over the plains and swamps in search > of its prey, which consists of rats and small quadrupeds generally.” Description Tasmanian masked owls are not only large, but robust. They closely resemble a barn owl, however are many times larger. Females weigh up to with a wingspan of up to . Their plumage is mainly a variable combination of browns and greys, generally darker than the other Australian subspecies. Their upperparts are dark brown to pale chestnut, with white speckling. Females are considerably darker, as well as larger, than the males, ranging from in length, compared with the males’ . They have broad, black-bordered, buff to chestnut facial discs, and fully feathered legs with powerful feet and long talons. Distribution and habitat The natural range of the owl is limited to Tasmania, where it has been recorded throughout the state, with the exception of the south-west. The owls inhabit both wet and dry eucalypt forests, woodlands and adjoining areas of agricultural land. Preferred habitat is areas close to the forest edge, containing a mosaic of understorey components. They require large old-growth trees with capacious hollows for nesting. The home range of a breeding pair may be more than ; areas identified as important for breeding include the east coast between Hobart and St Marys, the Derwent and Huon Valleys and the mid-north coast, as well as fragmented patches in the Tamar Valley and the north-east coast. It has been recorded from Maria and Bruny Islands. The owl has also been successfully introduced to Lord Howe Island, a subtropical territory of New South Wales in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, where it is considered an invasive species. Behaviour These owls are secretive, relatively silent, and strictly nocturnal birds. They roost during the day, usually in trees in dense foliage or hollows, as well as in rocky overhangs and caves, and occasionally in farm sheds and other open buildings. Breeding These owls breed as territorial and monogamous pairs. They nest in large tree hollows with a floor of decaying wood debris. The female is fed by the male while incubating a clutch of 2-4 eggs for about 42 days before hatching. The chicks are covered in, at first, white, then creamy down, and fledge in 10–12 weeks. Fledged owls with traces of down may remain in the vicinity of the nest for several weeks. Breeding is seasonal with most eggs laid in spring from late October to early November. Anecdotally, Tasmanian masked owls were first bred in captivity in 1945 in Launceston by Miss Audrey Lee. However, the first detailed account of such an achievement is by David Fleay, who bred them at the Healesville Sanctuary in Victoria in 1946. Feeding These owls hunt at night, preying on a wide range of animals, from insects to mammals as large as rabbits, bandicoots and brushtail possums. Their main diet includes introduced rodents and rabbits in agricultural areas, and marsupials and native birds in less disturbed habitats. They often hunt from perches using sound to detect prey, which is usually taken on the ground by striking with the feet and using the talons to pierce and kill. Voice Among their calls, Tasmanian masked owls utter a loud, rich, hissing or rasping screech, the call of the female being deeper and harsher than that of the male. They also snap their beaks loudly as a warning against perceived threats. Status and conservation Tasmania The Tasmanian masked owl is considered to be endangered under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, because of its small population (estimated at about 1330 breeding birds, or 615 pairs) as well as ongoing habitat loss, especially of old-growth forest suitable for breeding. An important conservation need is to maintain nesting habitat in production forests.Anon. (10 October 2002). Threatened Fauna Manual for Production Forests in Tasmania – Masked Owl (draft).PDF download It is also threatened by competition for nest hollows by feral bees, kookaburras and possums. Lord Howe Island Between December 1922 and October 1930 almost 100 masked owls, mostly from Tasmania, were introduced to Lord Howe Island in an unsuccessful attempt to control black rats. The population there is considered to be a threat to the endemic Lord Howe woodhen and Lord Howe currawong, as well as to breeding seabirds, and is culled when possible.

Early years Alexandru Callimachi was born in Constantinople. His family were an established Moldavian-Greek Phanariote boyar and princely house. He was the son of Ioan Teodor Callimachi, Prince of Moldavia, and Raliţa Chrisoscoleo. Alexandru had three siblings: Grigore Callimachi (1735–1769), Prince of Moldavia; sister, Sevastiţa (born 1736), who married Mihai Suţu, Prince of Moldavia; and sister, Maria (1740–1831). His uncle Gavriil Callimachi (1689–1786) was a monk at Putna Monastery before he founded the St. George Cathedral in Iaşi. Career Callimachi served as Grand Dragoman of the Sublime Porte from 1785 to 1794. He gained the title of Prince of Moldavia in 1795. After Callimachi was deposed, he was succeeded by son-in-law Constantine Ypsilantis. With his reign over, Callimachi retired to Constantinople. Personal life Callimachi sealed a matrimonial alliance with his marriage to Elena Ghika, daughter of Scarlat Ghika Vodǎ, Prince of Moldavia and Prince of Wallachia. They had four children. Their oldest was daughter, Ralu (1769–1797), who married Ypsilantis in 1783. Their first son, the hospodar Scarlat Callimachi, was Prince of Moldavia at three different times, while Scarlat's son Alexandros was conferred the Ottoman title of Bala in June 1861, the first Christian to be so honored. They had two younger children, daughter, Eufrosina (1776–1835), and son, Ioan (1775–1821). Callimachi died in Bolu in 1821, the same year that Phanariote rule ended with the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire.

(stylized as dELiA*s) is a lifestyle brand of apparel & accessories, primarily targeting girls and young women. From its founding in 1993 through the early 2010s, Delia's was an independent retailer and direct marketer, and in its prime was the leading marketer to 10 to 24-year-old females in the United States, with labels for preteen girls (#deliasgirls) 7-13 and teenage girls between the ages of 13 to 19. Delia's was popular among college women, as many of its products were affordable and suitable for college-age students. It currently operates under license as a sub-brand of online retailer Dolls Kill. Products Delia's sells apparel (including pants, shorts, skirts, tees, jackets, blazers, and bikini tops and bottoms), accessories, footwear (including shoes and boots), cosmetics, and room furnishings. The brand previously sold to teenage consumers through direct mail catalogs, websites, and, for Delia's, mall-based specialty retail stores. As of 2020, Delia's products are only for sale through its parent label, Dolls Kill. History The company was launched in 1993 by two Yale University graduates. The company was acquired by Alloy Inc. in 2003, for $50 million.New Girl Order: Youth, Gender, and Generation in Contemporary Teen Girls' Media – Caryn E. Murphy The combined company had annual catalog, internet, and retail sales of $300 million. It also had a database of over 20 million names, constituting 30%–40% of U.S. consumers who were 12–18 years old. Alloy then spun off the company in 2005. In January 2013 HRSH Acquisitions LLC bought Alloy Inc, now being marketed as Alloy Apparel, for $3.7 million in cash. HRSH also assumed $3.1 million in liabilities. On December 5, 2014, it announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and would be liquidating all 95 stores. Shortly after, its shares fell more than 80% to $0.02. Steve Russo of Fab/Starpoint acquired the brand for $2.5 million, and in August 2015, re-opened the store with an online-only presence, but this was unsuccessful. Online fashion company Dolls Kill later licensed the Delia's name and re-launched it as a sub-brand in November 2018, with its clothes available online and through pop-ups in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

A. Ellis (sometime Vicar of St Mary-the-Virgin, Tothill Fields), and they had one son. His academic career began as a tutor at Keble College, Oxford (1909–1913). Further academic posts at Christ Church, Oxford and Corpus followed: he was a Student (the Christ Church equivalent of a Fellow at other colleges) and Tutor at Christ Church from 1914 to 1929, and assistant chaplain and college lecturer in divinity at Corpus Christi from 1920 to 1929. He was also a university lecturer in divinity studies from 1927 to 1929. Meanwhile, his priestly ministry included examining chaplain to John Kempthorne, Bishop of Lichfield (1913–1929) and a brief spell as priest-in-charge of St John the Evangelist, Wilton Road (Victoria, London; 1917–1918). He was a Temporary Chaplain to the Forces 1915-17, and was posted to King George Hospital for soldiers in London.TNA WO339/105421 Service RecordHe would later write of his experiences in ‘Religious Reality’. Its introduction, by the Bishop of Lichfield, notes that Rawlinson was ‘The sort of man with whom men are not afraid to talk’, referring to his work in preparing officers and men in military hospitals for Confirmation.'Religious Reality'A Book For Men' by AEJ Rawlinson,Longman's,1918,Preface He was appointed a Chaplain to the King (George V; 1930–1936) and departed Oxford to become Archdeacon of Auckland, a Canon Residentiary of Durham Cathedral, and examining chaplain to Hensley Henson, Bishop of Durham (all 1929–1936), before his election to the See of Derby. He was consecrated a bishop by Cosmo Gordon Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, on St Matthias' day (24 February) 1936 at St Paul's Cathedral. As an outstandingly biblical scholar, Rawlinson’s name appeared for several more senior bishoprics and, although he had the support of successive archbishops, his name was not forwarded to the Crown with the Prime Minister’s recommendation for appointment. The Prime Minister was the key figure in such appointments and Rawlinson was considered for vacancies at London in 1939,Lambeth Palace Library,Lang 1938 Bath and Wells in 1945 and Lincoln and Salisbury in 1946. There are accounts of the appointment processes in PREM5,folders 257,388 and 346 at TNAThe problem was that although Rawlinson’s academic prowess was greatly admired, his personal relationships, especially with his clergy, caused considerable concern. In 1945, for example, in recommending Rawlinson for Bath and Wells, Archbishop Fisher justifies the translation because of Rawlinson’s reputation in Derby. ‘He dislikes his own Diocese and I don’t think they like him’. TNA PREM5/257 Successive Prime Ministers refused to risk making an unpopular appointment. He retired to Golders Green in 1959 and died at a London hospital.

It began as a series of hardcover books known as The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures, and subsequently became an online database exclusively. Each entry in the catalog typically includes the film's title, physical description, production and distribution companies, production and release dates, personal credits, a plot summary, and notes on the film's history. The films are indexed by personal credits, production and distribution companies, year of release, and major and minor plot subjects. To qualify for the \\"Feature Films\\" volumes, a film must have been commercially made by an American company, and given a theatrical release in 35 mm or larger gauge to the general public, with a running time of at least 40 minutes. Publications  The hardcover volumes published: * A, Film Beginnings, 1893–1910 (1995) ** Subtitled \\"A Work in Progress\\" due to the scant information available on many films released in this era. Foreign-made films are included if they were released by American companies. * F1, Feature Films, 1911–1920 (1988) * F2, Feature Films, 1921–1930 (1971) * F3, Feature Films, 1931–1940 (1993) ** With this volume, the project began to include plot summaries written especially for the catalog from viewing the movie itself, whenever possible, instead of relying on plot summaries taken from copyright registrations, studio publicity materials, or reviews. * F4, Feature Films, 1941–1950 (1997) * F6, Feature Films, 1961–1970 (1976) ** Due to the large number of co-productions between American and foreign companies in the 1960s, and the difficulty of determining any particular film's nationality, this volume includes all feature films released theatrically in the United States in that period. The hardcover edition includes pornographic features, although they have been excluded from the electronic database edition. Errors in the print editions have been carried over to the online version, despite published criticisms, and there is no means by which users can offer discussions or corrections. The publication of the hardcover volumes was suspended due to budgetary reasons after volume F4 in 1997. Feature films released from 1951 through 1960, and from 1971 through 1993 have been cataloged only in the online database. The project estimates that additional years will be cataloged at six-month intervals. Film School students are offered the opportunity to provide plot synopses and original research, but input from other, experienced film researchers is not encouraged. The project will also eventually catalog short films (beyond 1910) and newsreels.

They recorded two sessions for John Peel and released three albums before splitting up in the early 1990s. History The band was formed in 1980 by Mike McGuire (vocals) and Steve Rolls (Guitar) after disbanding 1st generation punk band The Now. They recruited Pete Jostins (Bass), Shaun Foreman (Guitar & Keyboards) and Colin Meech (Drums), with various others contributing in their early days.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, They were initially influenced by fairly standard indie bands such as A Certain Ratio and Shriekback. Their first releases were two self-financed singles, \\"Jane's Third Party\\" and the To You, With Regard EP, in 1980 and 1981 respectively. The latter was recorded with the core line up of McGuire and Jostins plus new guitarist Simon Childs, this trio constituted the band on all further releases. Together with two well received John Peel radio seasons , they were sufficiently successful to attract major-label interest from CBS and Virgin Records. After a further single (Traffic Tax Scheme) on their own 'Chant' label they signed a deal with Warners subsidiary Blanco y Negro, debuting on the label in 1986 with eight versions of the single \\"Sing Song\\". After releasing the Spacemate package - a double LP, book, poster, set of cards and instruction manual, packaged together in a soap box container and designed by Jon Wozencroft, the band moved on to indie label Rough Trade Records, where they would stay for the rest of their career. Their fondness for short songs was evident on their first Rough Trade release, a 7-inch EP featuring eight, 1 minute songs and titled \\"Autumn Cut Back Job Lot Offer\\", released in early 1987. The following year, they released their second album, '76 Kids Forever, which they described as a \\"soap opera musical\\". The band continued for one final effort, 1990's Ko-Opera album, a very different proposition as they utilized contemporary dance beats to deconstruct early 90s consumerism. Sadly this was the swansong and the band split up soon after , with an unheard and unreleased album (minus Simon Childs) in the can. The band recorded two sessions for John Peel's BBC Radio 1 programme, in 1983 (Let's Evolve, Relationships) and 1984 (A Walk in the Park, Problem-Solving Broadcasts 1-3, T Minus Tranquility), the first released as an EP in 1986.Sudden Sway Peel Session details at the BBC's Keeping It Peel site They also made an appearance on Whistle Test, performing \\"Packet of Vacuum\\" , \\"Father I Do\\" and one other track , plus an appearance on C4 \\"Night Network\\" playing \\"Solo Store Detective Man\\".

Rail cars The standard Edwards Rail Car was designed and recommended for branch line service where traffic requirements are within its capacity, for high speed operation, on roadbeds where the grades are not too severe. Three types of propulsion systems, mechanical, Diesel-electric or hydrostatic driven were available. The mechanically driven car employs the use of engine, transmission, final drive gear box with sprockets and chains to deliver power to the driving wheels. Cars equipped with electric propulsion have an engine which turns a generator for providing electricity for the traction motors.

History  Bishop Athanasius founded The Daughters of St. Mary during the feast of the Holy Cross (March 19, 1965) with the blessing of then Patriarch Kyrillos VI, and initiated their first women in 1970. In 1974, a new facility was built, creating outreach programs for the poor, the elderly, orphans, and mentally handicapped individuals. Since then, the community has expanded their operation to Cairo, Mukattam, and Turah. Bishop Athanasius oversaw the nuns until his death on 16 November 2000.http://www.britishorthodox.org/103h.shtml  Social Works  The Daughters of St. Mary run several social projects as form of khedma, which in a Coptic context means “service as an act for God.van Doorn-Harder, Pieternella, Contemporary Coptic Nuns (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1995) 112.\\" Their services include “clinics and mobile clinics, nurseries, elementary schools, schools for vocational training, a crafts center, and projects for the mentally [handicapped], for elderly people who are physically or mentally disabled, and for young women and men.van Doorn-Harder, Pieternella, Contemporary Coptic Nuns (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1995) 118.\\" The nuns gear their social servers toward the disadvantaged groups within Egyptian society. For example, their medical facilities are often less expensive than government sponsored facilities, and the nuns provide better care for their patients. Furthermore, their services often reach groups marginalized by social taboos, such as mentally handicapped children who cannot find adequate care in Beni Suef.van Doorn-Harder, Pieternella, Contemporary Coptic Nuns (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1995) 119.  Differences From Other Coptic Nuns  The goal of The Daughters of St. Mary is to practice monasticism while serving the Coptic community by combating poverty, sickness, and furthering social justice. Their community service allows the nuns to interact with the secular world, unlike other Coptic nuns, who spend most of their time cloistered in convents, praying for the world.van Doorn-Harder, Pieternella, Contemporary Coptic Nuns (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1995) 4. Their dress is less constricting then other Coptic nuns, which allows them maneuverability to carry out their social projects. Their clothes are also gray rather than black, to symbolize their participation in the secular world.van Doorn-Harder, Pieternella, Contemporary Coptic Nuns (Columbia, S.C.: University of South Carolina Press, 1995) 101.

As a governmental body, SRT is headquartered at HM General Register House in Edinburgh and is a division of the National Records of Scotland (NRS), formerly of the National Archives of Scotland (NAS) before its merger into NRS. SRT is the centralised agency for the recording of known historical tartans and for paid registration of new tartan designs, which must fulfill fairly stringent criteria. SRT subsumed this registration role from a variety of previous not-for-profit and commercial organisations, most now defunct. Since December 2018, the Keeper of the Scottish Register of Tartans is the head of the NRS (who is also the Keeper of Records and Registrar General for Scotland more broadly). SRT's tartan database itself is also named the Scottish Register of Tartans. It is uncertain how large the database is, but it has absorbed records of at least 7,000 tartans from previous registries, in addition to accepting new entries from 2009 onward. History The government of Scotland had been considering sponsoring an official register of tartans, following a member's bill submitted by Jamie McGrigor MSP in February 2007. On 9 October 2008, the Scottish Parliament passed the \\"Scottish Register of Tartans Bill\\". On 13 November 2008, the bill received royal assent. The register's website was publicly launched on 5 February 2009. The Keeper of the Scottish Register of Tartans is the same person as the Keeper of the Records of Scotland and Registrar General for Scotland – roles that merged with the merger of the National Archives of Scotland (NAS) and General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) into the National Records of Scotland (NRS) in 2011. Since December 2018, this has been NRS Chief Executive Paul Lowe. Database of tartans SRT's database, also named simply Scottish Register of Tartans (SRT), is accessible without fee via the website . The purpose of the register is to provide a definitive and accessible resource to preserve specific tartan designs, including their thread counts. The data set comprises the pre-existing registrations of at least 7,000 tartans from the Scottish Tartans Authority (STA) International Tartan Index (ITI), which in turn had absorbed those of the Scottish Tartans Society (STS) Register of All Publicly Known Tartans (RTAS) and the IATS–TECA TartanArt Database a.k.a. International Registry of Tartans (IRT). The SRT also includes the records of the self-titled Scottish Tartans World Register (STWR) database, which were mostly but not entirely duplicative of the combined ITI records. From its 5 February 2009 launch date, SRT includes new registrations not found in any prior collections. Consequently, the SRT database includes all known records of historical tartans as well as many modern ones, which are often asserted to be intellectual property of particular individuals and organisations. The SRT database uses its own index-numbering system, while also preserving the ITI and STWR numbers when such designations already exist for a particular tartan. SRT users can register new tartans for a fee via the website or post, search for and request the thread counts of existing tartans (after registering for a free account), and receive notifications of newly registered tartans. The criteria for a new registration are fairly restrictive, requiring a clearly distinct name following one of several prescribed patterns, which must not confusingly misuse various pre-defined terms; authority to use the name, especially if it implies official recognition and acceptance by a clan, an organisation, or a jurisdiction; a design \\"sufficiently different\\" from all previously recorded tartans; and either a woven sample, a photograph thereof, or an accurate digitally rendered picture of the tartan. Thus, a significant amount of research and documentation is required, and the application fee is non-refundable, including upon rejection of an application. Amendments to SRT- specific records require a fee, but may be declined if they would effectively result in a new design; correction of errors in data imported from ITI or STWR do not require fees but generally require documentation. Between 1951 and 1992, the Lord Lyon King of Arms has recorded (or \\"noted\\") 28 distinct tartans in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland and a further 39 in the Lyon Court Book, for a total of 74 including some minor variations. These were recorded for certain specific purposes, usually official designation by clan chiefs and by authorized representatives of organisations (some as far removed from Scotland as Canadian provinces and a United States military academy). The office of the Lord Lyon has ceased direct tartan- recording activities, except in theory by direct petition from a clan chief or from a city or other government as a matter of heraldry. Revised from material originally published in: All of these tartans are also included in ITI and thus in STR. Intellectual property Registering with SRT does not automatically confer a copyright registration in the usual sense, but the application process provides for the recording of any asserted copyright status, which is sufficient under the Berne Copyright Convention. Any applicable trademark assertion can also be recorded with an application. Registry entries for a tartan may show copyright or trademark registration numbers from other bodies, such as the UK Intellectual Property Office, if submitted with the application or later in an registry amendment request. SRT also permits registrants to record usage-restriction preferences in their tartan records (such as use only by family or organisation members), though there are no actual legal statutes by which such restrictions could be enforced, only an informal sense of tartan etiquette. For intellectual property purposes, inclusion in the Scottish Register of Tartans \\"provides evidence of the existence and date of [the] design\\".

Its territory was formerly the Diocese of Egypt with North Africa and the Horn of Africa. On 29 June 2020 the diocese was elevated to the status of an ecclesiastical province, and became the forty-first province of the Anglican Communion. The Primate and Metropolitan of the province is the Archbishop of Alexandria. Its jurisdiction extends over North Africa and the Horn of Africa, a vast region encompassing the nations of Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and Djibouti. History Foundation The first Anglican missionaries arrived in Egypt in 1819, and the first church building, St Mark's in Alexandria, was consecrated in 1839, followed by All Saints in Cairo in 1876. Egypt became part of the Diocese of Jerusalem, founded in 1841, and under the metropolitical authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Many churches, schools, medical clinics, and hospitals were established by the Anglican community in Egypt and the surrounding territories, and in 1908 the Rev'd Llewellyn Gwynne was consecrated Bishop of Khartoum, a suffragan bishop to the Bishop of Jerusalem, to lead the Anglican community across north Africa. In 1920 the region was formed into a new diocese named the Diocese of Egypt and the Sudan, with Gwynne as the first diocesan Bishop in Egypt and the Sudan. The cathedral of the diocese was located at Khartoum, but St Mary's Church in Cairo was made a pro-cathedral for Egypt until 1938, when the new All Saints Cathedral in Cairo was opened and consecrated. Division of diocese The Diocese was divided in 1945, to form the two separate dioceses. The bishop and the cathedral at Khartoum both continued with the new Diocese of the Sudan. The pro-cathedral in Cairo became the cathedral of the new Diocese of Egypt, and Bishop Geoffrey Allen became the first Bishop in Egypt. Owing to the complex political situation in Egypt, the diocese (still under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury as Metropolitan) sought to distance itself from the Church of England, by adopting the denominational name \\"Episcopal Church in Egypt\\". Nonetheless, political tensions led to the seizing or destruction of many Anglican churches and properties in Egypt, and the expulsion of many British clergy. By 1956 there was no resident bishop, and only four priests in the entire diocese, with episcopal supervision temporarily provided by the Archbishop in Jerusalem. Provincial restructuring In 1976 the new Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East was formed, uniting four dioceses (including Egypt) into a new province. Jerusalem was reduced from an archbishopric to a bishopric, and the province was to be led by a Presiding Bishop, elected by rotation from amongst the four diocesan bishops of Jerusalem, Egypt, Cyprus, and Iran. In 1978 All Saints cathedral in Cairo was destroyed on the orders of the Egyptian Government. A new cathedral in Cairo was constructed and consecrated in 1988, with its architectural style modelled on a Bedouin tent. Expansion As the Diocese of Egypt grew in the early twenty-first century, the bishop established two episcopal areas, appointing an Area Bishop for the Horn of Africa in 2007, and an Area Bishop for North Africa in 2009. Following a huge expansion of mission activity in the Gambela Region, a further episcopal area was created in 2019, with Rajan Vincent Jacob, already serving as Archdeacon of Gambella, consecrated as the first Area Bishop of Gambella. The continued expansion led the diocese to seek authority to separate from the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem and the Middle East and form an autonomous province of the Anglican Communion. This was approved in 2019 by the Synod of the province, and in January 2020 by the Anglican Communion Primates' Meetings. The new Province of Alexandria was formed on 29 June 2020, with the former \\"Diocese of Egypt with North Africa and the Horn of Africa\\" split into four new dioceses.

He is the Primate and Metropolitan of the province, and the Ordinary of the Diocese of Egypt. Dioceses Diocese of Egypt The diocese has a cathedral in Cairo and a pro-cathedral in Alexandria.

Alexandria School of Theology The Alexandria School of Theology was inaugurated in 2003, and began educating students in 2006. The college is located in the Diocese of Egypt, and operates across two campuses, one in Alexandria (on the site St Mark's pro-cathedral), and the other in Cairo (on the site of All Saints' cathedral). Ordination candidates follow a three-year Diploma in Theology & Ministry course. The college also offers academic degree courses leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Theology and Master of Theology. The College is under the patronage of Saint Athanasius of Alexandria. St Cyprian College, Tunis The college is located in the Diocese of North Africa. Launched in 2012 under the direction of Bishop Bill Musk, it was originally a local remote-learning and lay- training project, which developed by 2015 into the St Cyprian Centre with campus facilities adjacent to St George's Church in Tunis. Working with the established Alexandria School of Theology (AST), the centre became St Cyprian College in 2018. It offers a Diploma in Theology & Ministry for ordination candidates and other church leaders, and students can also access the degree programmes of the AST through the college.

It may consist of formal university or college training or informal training provided by non-collegiate institutions. The simplest form of corporate education may be training programs designed \\"in- house\\" for an organization that may wish to train their employees on specific aspects of their job processes or responsibilities. More formal relationships may further exist where corporate training is provided to employees through contracts or relationships with educational institutions who may award credit, either at the institution or through a system of CEUs (Continuing Education Units). Many institutions or trainers offering corporate education will provide certificates or diplomas verifying the attendance of the employee. Some employers use corporate and continuing education as part of a holistic human resources effort to determine the performance of the employee and as part of their review systems. Increasingly organisations appear to be using corporate education and training as an incentive to retain managers and key employees within their organisation. This win-win arrangement creates better educated managers for the organisation and provides the employees with a more marketable portfolio of skills and, in many cases, recognised qualifications. The Difference Between Corporate Education and Corporate Training Most organisations tend to think of corporate education as corporate training. Corporate training programs are often competency based and related to the essential training employees need to operate certain equipment or perform certain tasks in a competent, safe and effective manner. The outcome of a corporate training program is a participant who is either able to operate a piece of equipment or perform a specific task in an effective manner according to pre-determined training criteria. The primary role of corporate training is to ensure an employee has the knowledge and skills to undertake a specific operation to enable an organisation can continue to operate. Fundamentally, corporate training is centred on knowledge transfer, with an instructor teaching or demonstrating a particular function and the student learning and demonstrating they can apply what they have learnt to a particular operation. Corporate education, however, adds another dimension and depth to training by involving learners as participants in generating new knowledge that assists an organisation to develop and evolve, rather than maintain the status quo. Corporate education focuses on developing the capability of an organisation to be able to do things and, in particular, the right things in order to be a sustainable and successful organisation. Corporate education involves a facilitator, rather than an instructor or trainer, to engage participants and encourage them to think about the what, how and why of what they are doing and to challenge their current paradigms. Corporate education is centred on introducing learning techniques to stimulate employees to think about what their organisation does, where it is heading, potential new opportunities for the organisation and new and better ways of doing things. While the role of corporate training is to develop the operational competency of individuals, the purpose of corporate education is to promote the development of capability of both an individual and their organisation.Ryan, L: \\"Corporate Education: A Practical Guide to Effective Corporate Learning\\", p2-3. Griffin Press. 2010. . Increasingly organisations appear to be using corporate education as an incentive to retain managers and key employees within their organisation. This win-win arrangement creates better educated managers and employees for the organisation and gives individual employees a more marketable portfolio of skills and, in many cases, recognised qualifications.Prince, C: \\"Strategic Change: the role of in-company management education\\".

His collaboration with Robert Palmer culminated in the Grammy nominated album Drive, which was released in 2003. In 2005, Carlton joined Eric Burdon and the Animals. The collaboration resulted in the Grammy nominated album Soul of a Man, which was released in 2006. Carlton has released four albums with his own band, Carl Carlton and the Songdogs. Carlton, who grew up on a farm in Northern Germany, took off for the Netherlands at the age of 17. There he began playing in what was at the time one of the liveliest European rock and pop scenes. Starting in Groningen, Carlton played in numerous rock bands, including Herman Brood and his Wild Romance, Long Tall Ernie and the Shakers (with whom he recorded a gold record in 1977) and Vitesse. In 1979, he traveled across the Atlantic to become a guitarist for the band Mink DeVille. Also in the 1980s, Carlton played with Manfred Mann's Earth Band. Most notably during this time, Carlton acted as a guitarist, composer and producer for two of Germany's biggest rock stars, Peter Maffay and Udo Lindenberg, with whom he recorded thirteen and six albums, respectively. Of these, eleven singles topped the charts. In the meantime, Carlton married and fathered a child, Max Buskohl, who has since followed in his father's footsteps with his own band, Empty Trash. At the end of the 1980s, Carlton began writing film and television scores, while, in addition, he played guitar for Joe Cocker, Keb Mo, Jimmy Barnes, Eric Burdon, Mother's Finest, Simple Minds and numerous other bands. Personal projects In the early 1990s, Carlton and longtime musical partner Bertram Engel, a drummer, formed a band called New Legend, which also included keyboardist Pascal Kravetz and the two Dutch blues rockers Harry de Winter and Peter Bootsman. Two CDs were released before the band broke up two years later due to personality conflicts. In 1994, Carlton took up residence in Dublin, which at the time was one of the few pulsating metropolises for music in Europe. In 1999, Carlton again formed a band of his own, Carl Carlton and the Songdogs, which consisted of a multi-national line- up of musicians. In 2001, Carlton convinced Robert Palmer, whom he had worked with previously as one of his guitar players, to record a version of \\"Milk Cow's Calf Blues\\" with him as part of a tribute album to Robert Johnson. The resulting compilation, Hellhound On My Trail, was nominated for a Grammy. Its success convinced Palmer and Carlton to co-produce another pure blues album, the Grammy-nominated Drive, in 2003. Drive was also named one of Billboard's Top Ten Blues albums for that year. Carl Carlton and the Songdogs The inner circle of the band consists of Carlton, guitarist Moses Mo, bassist Wyzard (of the Atlanta funk group Mother's Finest), and Pascal Kravetz. Temporary Songdogs have included Sonny Landreth, keyboardist Ian McLagan, Levon Helm and Garth Hudson. The band's first album, Revolution Avenue, was recorded at Dockside Studios in Louisiana. A second LP called Love & Respect was released three years later. With more of an international membership than before, the band this time consisted of, in addition to its core members, Robert Palmer, Levon Helm, Sonny Landreth, Jon Smith, the White Trash Horns, Bobby Keys and Xavier Naidoo. Love & Respect was also recorded at Dockside Studios. Martin Huch, a multi-instrumentalist, was soon hired along with Wayne P. Sheehy for live performances. It was at the end of the Love & Respect tour that Carlton collapsed from exhaustion due to an unrelenting work schedule. The incident was caught live by television cameras. Several weeks later, in the midst of doing PR for the Drive album, Robert Palmer died suddenly. The next Songdogs album, Cahoots & Roots, was released in 2005. Also in 2005, Carlton joined Eric Burdon and The Animals and recorded a blues album called Soul of a Man with Ivan Neville, James \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson, Ricky Fataar, and Mike Finnegan. It too was nominated for a Grammy. Carlton, who in the meantime had given up his second home in Mallorca and taken up residence on the island of Gozo near Malta, began making a fourth album called Songs for the Lost and Brave, whose fifteen tracks explored the many bitter blows dealt to Carlton in recent years. This included a divorce from his second wife. By this time, Zack Alford, a drummer who had played for both Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie, had been added to the band, which was invited by Levon Helm, one of Carlton's closest friends, to record the new album at Helm's studio in Woodstock, New York. One of the album's tracks, a cover of Stephen Stills' \\"For What Its Worth\\", included the voices of Carlton's son, Max Buskohl, and Eric Burdon. Carlton and his son also joined together for a track on Klaus Voormann's album, A Sideman's Journey. \\"Toast To Freedom\\" In 2011, Carlton and Larry Campbell wrote \\"Toast To Freedom\\", a commemorative song to celebrate Amnesty International's 50th Anniversary. Carl Carlton & the Songdogs backed up more than 50 internationally renowned musicians, who contributed to the song in Levon Helm's studio The Barn in Woodstock, among them Kris Kristofferson, Warren Haynes, Donald Fagen, Keb Mo, Rosanne Cash, Carly Simon, Marianne Faithfull, Jimmy Barnes, Jane Birkin, Eric Burdon, Levon Helm and many others. \\"Toast to Freedom\\" was produced by Bob Clearmountain and released by Amnesty International on 3 May 2012. Guitar Since the late 1990s, Carlton has endorsed the guitars of the German manufacturer Duesenberg Guitars, which in collaboration with the guitarist has developed the C.C. Signature model. Carlton also endorses THC-Amps, Larson Bros. acoustic guitars and T.Rex effects pedals.

The site is under the high limestone cliffs of Capo Caccia, 100 metres north of the famous Neptune's Grotto. Overview The cave is considered the biggest marine cave in the Mediterranean Sea. With the around 10 entrances, arches and tunnels, it is possible to make dives from 0 to 35 m, through long and large tunnels, air chambers and different ways. The walls are covered with red coral and yellow leptosamnia. With the other cape of Punta Giglio and the Porto Conte Bay, the cave is part of a Marine reserve set up in 2003. Its flora and fauna are typically Mediterranean including groupers, lobsters, congers and moray eels, and thriving crustacean life.

Unlike slats or droop flaps, the main wing upper surface and its nose is not changed. Instead, a portion of the lower wing is rotated out in front of the main wing leading edge. Current Boeing aircraft, and many others, use this design between the fuselage and closest engine, where the wing is thickest. Outboard of the engine, slat flaps are used on the leading edge. The Boeing 727 also used a mix of inboard Krueger flaps and outboard slats, although it had no engine between them. Most early jet airliners, such as the Boeing 707 and Boeing 747, used Krueger flaps only. Operation While the aerodynamic effect of Krueger flaps may be similar to that of slats or slots (in those cases where there is a gap or slot between the flap trailing edge and wing leading edge), they are deployed differently. Krueger flaps, hinged at their foremost position that once deployed actually become their trailing edges, hinge forwards from the under surface of the wing, increasing the wing camber and maximum coefficient of lift. It produces a nose-up pitching moment. Conversely, slats extend forwards from the upper surface of the leading edge. Also, when deployed, Krueger flaps result in a much more pronounced blunt leading edge on the wing, helping to achieve better low-speed handling. This allows smaller-radius wing leading edges, better optimized for cruise. Leading edge Krueger flaps enhance wing's low speed lift production especially on swept wing aircraft. The Krueger flaps developed for the Boeing 747 were constructed from fiberglass honeycomb material and were designed to be intentionally distorted into an aerofoil section on deployment.Taylor 1990, p. 114. History Krüger flaps were invented by Werner Krüger in 1943 and evaluated in the wind tunnels in Göttingen, Germany. One of the earliest civil applications was the Boeing 707 whereas swiss FFA claimed the first use of the flap in its FFA P-16 fighter which flew in 1955.X-Planes of Europe II, Tony Buttler Hikoki Puplication 2015. Page 193. The flap was added to prevent wing stall with an extreme attitude take-off with the tail dragging on the runway, a scenario that had caused two de Havilland Comet accidents. A preliminary flight test had been made on the Boeing 367-80 using a fixed flap and a skid on the after-body.\\"The Road to the 707\\" Cook, William H., TYC Publishing Company, Bellevue, 1991, , p.249 After the Boeing test flight on the B-707 prototype on 15 July 1954, Krueger flaps were first used in production for the B-727 which made its maiden flight on 9 February 1963. Image:Krueger-Flap.pngKrueger flap operation Image:Slats.pngSlat operation Boeing commenced a series of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing- leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable- camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes just ahead of the leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag. The newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to reduce fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program.

Dar bāre-ye Elly) is a 2009 Iranian drama film directed by Asghar Farhadi. It is the fourth film by Farhadi. The film is about middle class relationships in Iran. Farhadi won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 59th Berlin International Film Festival for the film. The film was also nominated for 10 awards at the 27th Fajr International Film Festival in Tehran where Farhadi won the Crystal Simorgh for best director. About Elly was Iran's official submission for the competition in the Foreign Film section at the 82nd Academy Awards. Plot A group of middle-class Iranians, former classmates at the law faculty of the university, go to the Caspian Sea for a three-day vacation: Sepideh, her husband Amir and their young daughter; Shohreh, her husband Peymān and their two children, including their son Arash and Nāzy and her husband Manuchehr. Sepideh, who planned the trip, brings along her daughter's kindergarten teacher, Elly, in order to introduce her to Ahmad, a divorced friend visiting from Germany. At the seaside mansion that Sepideh has booked the woman in charge tells them the owners will return the next day and suggests that they stay instead in a deserted beach-front villa. Sepideh lies to the old woman about the relationship between Elly and Ahmad: she says they're married and on their honeymoon. Elly is a little shy, but begins to feel interested in Ahmad, who seems to have feelings for Elly. She calls her mother and lies to her, saying that she's with her co-workers at a sea-side resort and that she expects to go back to Tehran the following day, as planned. Sepideh, however, doesn't want her to leave and hides her luggage. One of the mothers asks Elly to watch the children playing at the seaside. Later, Arash is found floating in the sea and Elly is nowhere to be seen. Arash is resuscitated, but the group doesn't know whether Elly has drowned or has just left for Tehran. The police are called, while the group continues to search for Elly. The group starts to blame each other for the series of events leading up to her disappearance and her presence on the trip. However, things are not as they seem, as it turns out that Sepideh has been lying and knew Elly was engaged to a man named Alireza. Since Elly was reluctant to marry Alireza, Sepideh insisted she come on the trip to meet Ahmad. Elly initially refused the invitation, as an engaged woman but, following pressure from Sepideh, eventually accepted. Alireza arrives and attacks Ahmad, then asks Sepideh whether Elly had refused her invitation to go on holiday. Sepideh wants to protect the honour of Elly and tell the truth but, following pressure from the others who feel threatened by Alireza, lies and tells him that Elly accepted the invitation without hesitation. In the climactic scene, Alireza is shown identifying Elly in a mortuary, breaking down in tears.About Elly Review - The Guardian Cast * Shahab Hosseini as Ahmad * Golshifteh Farahani as Sepideh * Taraneh Alidoosti as Elly * Peyman Moaadi as Peymān * Mani Haghighi as Amir * Merila Zarei as Shohreh * Ahmad Mehranfar as Manouchehr * Rana Azadivar as Nāzy * Saber Abar as Ali-Reza Crew * Sound recorder: Hassan Zahedi * Sound mix: Mohammad-Reza Delpak * Sound editor: Reza Narimizadeh Reception The film was hailed critically upon the release in its home country. One year after its release, it was voted the 4th greatest Iranian movie of all time by the national society of Iranian critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 99% approval rating with an average rating of 8.2/10 based on 68 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"About Elly offers viewers performances as powerful as its thought-provoking ideas, and adds another strong entry to Asghar Farhadi's impressive filmography.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 87 out of 100 based on 28 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim.\\" One of the strongest supporters of About Elly is David Bordwell, film theorist and film critic, who has called it a masterpiece: \\"Gripping as sheer storytelling, the plot smoothly raises some unusual moral questions. It touches on masculine honor, on the way a thoughtless laugh can wound someone’s feelings, on the extent to which we try to take charge of others’ fates. I can't recall another film that so deeply examines the risks of telling lies to spare someone grief. But no more talk: The less you know in advance, the better. About Elly deserves worldwide distribution pronto.\\" Alissa Simon of Variety wrote in her review: \\"To many, the film’s first half may seem mannered, even boring, with the old pals, particularly the men, indulging in obnoxious, condescending behavior. But after an alarming incident at the 45-minute mark, Farhadi ratchets up the tension, and the pic becomes a mystery thriller of sorts that epitomizes the Sir Walter Scott quote, Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.\\" Adam Eisenberg in his review from Tribeca Film Festival called About Elly: \\"a mirror of sorts to Michelangelo Antonioni’s stylistic revolution, L'Avventura.\\" And wrote: \\"Here the contrast between Farhadi and Antonioni is perhaps sharpest. Although L'Avventura is certainly cinematic with its relationship between images and themes, ... In Farhadi’s world, cold glances, a husband’s demand for more tea, and tearful rage, are all comments, not symbols, on a culture where telling the truth is often not the best option. It’s a culture that lends itself to suspense, and Farhadi might have more in common with Hitchcock, than the Iranian New Wave he emerges from.\\" Christopher Bourne, upon seeing the film at the Tribeca Film Festival, said: \\"The brilliance of Farhadi’s script and direction (his efforts earned him the Silver Bear for best director at this year’s Berlin Film Festival) becomes most apparent in the latter stages of the film. As one secret after another is revealed, Farhadi deftly maps out the shifts in the perceptions and behavior of the characters toward each other as well as the viewer’s perception of the characters.\\" Lee Marshall of Screen Daily called the film \\"One of the most remarkable Iranian films to surface in the last few years\\" and added: \\"About Elly is a small but compelling ensemble piece of surprising depth. It’s one of those rare films that can be read on one level purely as a satisfying drama, but which also has a rich, independent inner life, centered on big questions about right and wrong, social coercion and the lies people tell themselves and each other.\\" Accolades * Won Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Screenplay 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Won Jury Grand Prize Asia Pacific Screen Award 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Nominated Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Film 2009 (Asghar Farhadi - Mahmoud Razavi) * Nominated Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Actress 2009 (Golshifteh Farahani) * Won Asia-Pacific Film Festival for Best Screenplay 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Won Special Jury Award Asia-Pacific Film Festival 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Won Silver Berlin Bear for Best Director 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Nominated Golden Berlin Bear 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Nominated 27th Fajr International Film Festival for Best Actor 2009 (Shahab Hosseini) * Won Netpac Award Brisbane International Film Festival 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Nominated Golden Frog Camerimage for Main Competition 2009 (Hossein Jafarian) * Nominated Gold Hugo Chicago International Film Festival for Best Feature 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Won Crystal Simorgh for Audience Choice of Best Film in 27th Fajr International Film Festival 2009 * Won Crystal Simorgh for Best Director in 27th Fajr International Film Festival 2009 (Asghar Farhadi) * Won Crystal Simorgh for Best Sound Fajr Film Festival 2009 (Mohammad Reza Delpak) * Won Golden Crow Pheasant (Suvarna Chakoram) International Film Festival of Kerala for Director/Producer 2009 * Won Jury Award Tribeca Film Festival for Best Narrative Feature 2009 (Asghar Farhadi)Cinema Guild * Won Reader Jury of the \\"Standard\\" Vienna International Film Festival 2009 * House of Cinema Award for Best Actor 2010 (Shahab Hosseini) * Nominated Asian Film Awards for Best Director 2010 (Asghar Farhadi) * Nominated Asian Film Awards for Best Screenwriter 2010 (Asghar Farhadi) References External links  About Elly at the Memento Films website * About Elly in Iran Negah * About Elly gallery in 30nema website Category:2009 films Category:Films directed by Asghar Farhadi Category:Films set in Iran Category:Iranian drama films Category:Films whose director won the Best Directing Crystal Simorgh Category:Crystal Simorgh for Audience Choice of Best Film winners ","title":"About Elly"},{"id":"21545927","text":"The MSC Cordoba is a container ship built in 2008 by the Daewoo Mangalia Heavy Industries in Mangalia, Romania and currently operated by Mediterranean Shipping Company S.A.

North Korea also claims sovereignty of the islands. The Liancourt Rocks have been administered by South Korea since 1954 by the Korea Coast Guard. This action was taken after the United States stated in the Rusk documents that the Japanese claim to the Liancourt Rocks would not be renounced in Japan's post-World-War-II peace treaty. In 1954, Japan proposed a reference to the International Court of Justice, which South Korea rejected, believing that the Liancourt Rocks are irrefutably South Korean territories, and thus should not be dealt through diplomatic negotiations or judicial settlement between South Korea and Japan.Questions and Answers on Dokdo, Q14 in the official Dokdo Site by Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Korea There are conflicting interpretations about the historical state of sovereignty over the islets. Korean claims are partly based on references to a Korean island called Usan-do in various historical records, maps and encyclopedias such as the Samguk Sagi, Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam (), and Dongguk munheon bigo (). According to the Korean view, these refer to today's Liancourt Rocks, while the Japanese researchers of these documents have stated that the various references to Usan-do refer at different times to Jukdo, its neighboring island Ulleungdo, or a non-existent island between Ulleungdo and Korea. p. 4; Article 2, para. 2: \\"Such description... rather reminds us of Utsuryo Island.\\" para. 3: \\"A study... criticizes... that Usan Island and Utsuryo Island are two names for one island.\\" para. 4: \\"that island does not exist at all in reality.\\" Researchers disagree on who first had administrative control over the islets due to ambiguities in early historical records and maps, partly due to changes in the names of the islands in the area over the years. History The Three Kingdoms period Samguk Sagi (History of Three Kingdoms) recorded that in 512, the 13th reign year of King Jijeung of Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, General Kim Isabu conquered Usan, whence it submitted yearly tributes to the Silla court. The Samguk Sagi mentions that Usan had been an independent kingdom based on Ulleungdo. \\"十三年夏六月,于山國帰服,歳以士宜為貢于山國,在溟州正東海島,或名欝陵島,地方一百里,恃嶮不服,伊異斯夫,為何瑟羅州軍主,謂于山人愚悍難以威来,可以計服,乃多造木偶師子,分載戦船,抵其国海岸誑告白,汝若不服,則放此猛獣,踏殺之,國人恐懼則降.\\" The character \\"do\\" (島) refers to island, whereas \\"guk\\" (國) refers to state/nation.

Although it is impossible for one to survive at Liancourt Rocks without outside assistance, a distinction to be noted is that Usanguk refers to a state based on Ulleng-do, whereas Usando refers to an island. Japanese scholars argue that Usando refers to either Ulleung-do or Jukdo while Korean scholars argue that it refers to Liancourt Rocks.法学研究論集(studies in law) 第6号 濱田太郎(Ph. D.

Retrieved January 9, 2006 but interpretation of the context is disputed. The text is interpreted as follows: \\"Usando (우산도 于山島) and Mureungdo (무릉도 武陵島, a former name of Ulleungdo), in the sea due east of Uljin Prefecture, are close enough to each other to be mutually visible in clear weather at the top of the mountain\\". South Korea insists that this constitutes clear evidence that Usan- do refers to the Liancourt Rocks, the only island that is visible from Ulleungdo only in clear weather. Japan, however, holds that the latter part as \\"come into view from mainland Korea,\\" believing that it refers instead to Jukdo, located two kilometers east of Ulleungdo. \\"朝鮮時代の地誌では、島嶼を記録する場合は、その海島を所管する群県の所在地からの方向と、陸地からの距離が明記される決まりになっていた。 (When the Korean topography records in the Joseon dynasty described islands, it was regulated to write the direction from the local government and the distance from the land.) See . 竹島は日韓どちらのものか by Prof. Shimojyo. South Korea counters that Jukdo is only 2 kilometers apart from Ulleung-Do and therefore is visible regardless of altitude or weather, as well as that the passage is clearly written in the context of the two islands mutually, rather than in relation to the Korean mainland, as established in \\"相去不遠,\\" \\"相\\" meaning \\"mutually.\\" South Korea also refers to Ulleung-Do Sajuk (울릉도 사적). This work was compiled by Korean government officer Jang Han-sang (장한상; 張漢相) in 1696 after the An Yong- bok incident under orders from the Joseon kingdom. In it, he states that, from Ulleung-do, \\"to the west can be seen the rugged mountains of Daegwallyeong; beholding the sea to the east, I noticed a faint island in the jin (辰) direction (east-south-east), not more than one-third of the size of Ulleung, and not possibly more than 300 li (approximately 100km) away.\\" 西望大關嶺逶迤之狀 東望海中 有一島 杳在辰方 而其大未滿蔚島三分之一 不過三百餘里 Furthermore, Jang also states in a later part of the work that \\"I climbed to the peak of the island in order to see the boundaries of Japan, but no Japanese islands could be seen at all, and I cannot, therefore, fathom the distance to the border.\\"登島山峰 審望彼國之域 則杳茫無眼杓之島 其遠近未知幾許 This evidence is used by South Korean experts to demonstrate that contemporary Koreans regarded this island to the south-east as under Korean control. Paldo Chongdo The Dong'guk yeoji seungnam (동국여지승람, \\"Augmented Geography Survey of the Eastern Nation (Korea)\\", 1481) defining Korea's territory, stated that \\"Usando and Ulleungdo are under the jurisdiction of Uljin-hyeon of Gangwon-do as an administrative unit. However, it also mentions that the tree and the beach could be clearly seen on a fine day.肅宗27巻,20年8月14日己酉 \\"本島峰巒樹木, 自陸地歴歴望見, 而凡其山川紆曲, 地形闊狭, 民居遺址, 土物所産, 倶載於我国《輿地勝覧》書, 歴代相伝, 事跡昭然\\", National Institute of Korean History. The 1531 revision of this book includes the Paldo Chongdo (\\"Map of the Eight Provinces\\"), showing two separate islands of Usan-do and Ulleung-do in the middle of the Sea of Japan. Usando is drawn to the west of Ulleungdo, which is clearly an error since there exists no island that to the west of Ulleungdo. From the early fifteenth century to the aftermath of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), the Joseon court was unable and unwilling to maintain a civilian population on either Ulleungdo or Usando. According to the Taejong Sillok (\\"Annals of King Taejong\\"), the mainland government forcibly evacuated the islands during Taejong's reign, in accordance with the \\"vacant island policy\\".太宗實錄 太宗33卷17年(1417)2月8日乙丑, National Institute of Korean History. Thus, the islets were only occasionally populated by permanent settlers up to the seventeenth century; a permanent population existed only on Ulleungdo. Following the war, the islands were completely vacated. 1677 report Takeshima Tōkai Yuraiki Bassho Hikae, written by Ōya Kyuemon, records that in 1618 the Tokugawa shogunate granted fishing rights to the Ōya and Murakawa families of Yonago, and that in 1661 bestowed the feudal tenure of \\"Takeshima\\", which was then referred to Ulleung-do. On the way to Ulleung-do, Japanese fishermen sometimes used islands called in Japanese as an intermediate port of call. In 1677 a retainer by the name of Saito Hessen compiled the Onshu shicho goki (\\"Records on Observations in Oki Province\\"), a set of records based upon observations he had made under orders from the daimyō of Izumo (Unshū). As this report was compiled from a Japanese geographical perspective, Japanese scholars argue that Matsushima (the closer island) refers to Liancourt Rocks and Takeshima (the farther island) refers to Ulleungdo. On the other hand Korean scholars argue that a closer look reveals the grants were given to permit them to travel abroad, thus proving that fishing area was foreign territory. These grants led to a conflict with native settlers in Ulleungdo and were later revoked by Kanpaku of Japanese Tokugawa Shogunate in January 1696.First Japanese Record on Tokdo from the First Written Records on Tokdo site maintained by Iwato Hashimori 1695 inquiry into Ulleungdo In 1695 the Shogunate inquired of the Tottori clan (Tottori Prefecture today) if Takeshima (Ulleungdo) and \\"Matsushima\\" (Liancourt Rocks) were part of either Inaba or Hōki Province, where the Oya and Murakawa of Yonago resided.竹嶋之書附 Question on Page 1, Reply on page 2. The Shogunate inquired: :Since when has Takeshima(Ulleungdo) become a part of either Inaba (因幡) or Hōki (伯耆) Province? Was it before or after the year when your ancestor was given the two provinces (in 1632)? Are there any islands other than Takeshima(Ulleungdo) that are within the jurisdiction of the two provinces? The Tottori replied: :Takeshima(Ulleungdo) does not belong to Inaba (因幡) or Hōki (伯耆). \\"No other islands belong to the domain, including Takeshima (Ulleungdo) and Matsushima(Dokdo).\\" 1696 Murakami Document Korean historical sources state that the administrator of Tokugawa shogunate reaffirmed in January 1696 that Ulleungdo and Dokdo belonged to Korea, quoting An Yong-bok's testimony.Shin, Yong-Ha, in , says, \\"An Yong-bok's activity proved highly successful, because the lord of Tsushima sent Judge Tairano Naritsune to Korea in January 1697 to notify the Korean government of the Kanpaku's decision. By 1699, the diplomatic notes had been exchanged and all the formalities had been cleared to recognize Korea's title to Ullungdo and Dokdo. After the An Yong-bok incident and the Kanpaku's reconfirmation of Korea's title to Ullungdo and Tokdo around the end of the 17th century, no documentary records of the period showed Japan's claim to these two islands.\\" Naito Seichu (ないとう せいちゅう 內藤正中) raises doubts as to the accuracy of An's testimony regarding the Kanpaku document. He denies the existence of the Kanpaku document claimed by An. 'When An Yong-bok was transferred to Tottori, the feudal lord could not have met An because he had gone to Edo. There was initially no such document as given An stating Ulleungdo and Liancourt Rocks are Korean territory. On the contrary, An Yong-bok and Park Eo-Dun were forcefully taken because they had trespassed at Takeshima, considered Japanese territory. It is impossible that the Tottori hanshu could have issued papers stating territorial title to Koreans who had been arrested.' (Dokdo and Takeshima, pp. 101, 147) On his first trip to Japan in 1693, An Yong-Bok stayed in Tottori from June 1 to 7; he met with four officers of the Tottori feudal government. On his second trip to Japan in 1696, An again stayed in Tottori from June 21 to some time before August 6; the Tottori hanshu was away from Tottori to Edo from June 23 to July 19. Contacts between Tottori officers and An clearly existed, and the Tottori feudal lord was not away for the whole period of An's stay in Tottori. The dispute between Chosun Korea and Tokugawa Japan about the ownership of Ulleung-do ignited when Korean fishermen clashed with Japanese fishermen in Ulleungdo waters in 1692. The following year, An Yong-Bok and Park Eo-dun, representing Korean fishing communities, are variously said to have visited, drifted, or even been abducted by Japanese fishermen, arriving at Oki island in 1693. Taking this occasion, An discussed territorial title matters with a Japanese governmental official, reminding him that Ulleungdo and Jasando (자산도, 子山島 sic; a scribal corruption of Usan-do 于山島/亐山島) are Korean territory. As a result, the bakufu issued prohibitions banning Japanese fishermen from travelling to Ulleng-do. This is called the First An Yong-bok incident. An, on being released from a two-year exile on charges of traveling to a foreign country without permission, made a second trip to Japan together with a group of Koreans from Dongnae and other maritime regions in 1696 with documents and a map to reconfirm his initial claim during the first confrontation, which had come under suspicion by the Korean government due to the Tsushima clan's delaying Edo's orders to notify the Korean government of Japan's prohibition to travel to Ulleungdo. Aware of the severe punishment which the Edo government would certainly pass on the Tsushima lord, Tsushima expedited Edo's decision to nullify \\"Permission to cross to Takeshima (Ulleund-do)\\" to the Korean government, which Edo had been withholding until An's visit. Although Japan did not mention Matsushima (Liancourt Rocks) on the prohibition papers, no Japanese could legitimately travel to either Takeshima or Matsushima until the end of the bakufu period. This document from An's second trip relays An's words that Ulleungdo, geographically subordinate to Gangwon province, was administered by Dongnae- bu. The document records the distance between Takeshima (Ulleungdo) and Matsushima (Liancourt Rocks) as 50 ri, and also states, in a rough copy of An's map of Korea, that the two islets belonged to Korea's Gangwon province. In the Annals of King Sukjong, the official governmental chronicle, An is reported to have stated that Jasan-do 子山島(sic) was what the Japanese called Matsu-shima 松島 at that time. The primary source of the An Yong-bok statement is The Annals of King Sukjong, 22nd reign year (1696), 9th moon, 25th. \\"以鬱陵子山等島 定以朝鮮地界 至有關白書契\\" 1697 Korean court's decision to disregard Tsushima's request of a formal letter for Edo In Feb 1697, the Korean government decided to reject Tsushima clan's request to amend a previous letter that mentioned Korea's Ulleungdo, and that An Yong-Bok's visit to Japan to raise a legal case did not require a written response from Korea since the Royal Court had no foreknowledge. These facts were to be conveyed to the Tsushima envoy's house informally: \\"An was an unenlightened subject who got thrown about by a storm. If he executed something, it had not been known by the Joseon Royal Court.\\" In March 1699, the Korean government made a formal communication in writing that An was punished for submitting a legal case against the governor of Hokishu to the Edo government without authorisation from the Korean government.\\"若其呈書誠有妄作之罪故已施幽極之典 Although the Border Defense Command demanded capital punishment, King Sukjong commuted An's sentence to exile in positive consideration of his successful negotiations with the Edo government that resulted in the \\"prohibition of all Japanese travelling to Korea for fishing, harvesting, and lumbering for eternity\\".竹島紀事５巻: \\"永不許入往漁採\\" 1785 Map of Three Adjoining Countries A Japanese scholar of practical science, Hayashi Shihei, published \\"Map of Three Adjoining Countries\\" (三國接壤地圖) in his work \\"Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu\\" in 1785, which showed each country in distinct colours; Joseon (old name of Korea) in yellow, Japan in green. In the map, Ulleungdo and an island to its northeast were marked \\"As Korean territories (朝鮮ノ持ニ)\\". The name of the larger island was given as \\"竹嶋\\", the current name of Ulleungdo then in Japan. According to Korean scholars, the islands to the northeast of Ulleungdo represent the Liancourt Rocks, and thus proves Liancourt belonged to Korea at the time. According to Japanese scholars, neither of these conclusions are necessary or even probable, as the Liancourt Rocks are located southeast of Ulleungdo.\\"South Korea's Misunderstanding of 'A Map of Three Adjoining Countries (Sangoku Setsujozu 三国接壌図)' by Hayashi Shihei(林子平)\\" 1808 Usando, Ulleungdo, and Matsushima claimed to be the same island Dongguk yeojiji (1656) says \\"one theory has it that Usan-do and Ulleung-do are the same island\\" (一説于山 欝陵 本一島) Man'gi yoram (만기요람, \\"Handbook of State Affairs\\") from 1808 quotes the earlier Yeojiji (\\"Gazette\\", 1656) that Ulleungdo and Usando all belonged to Usan'guk, and Usando was equivalent to what the Japanese then called Matsushima. See the English translation at the bottom of this link However, there is no such description in the original Yeojiji. Instead, Dongguk yeojiji says \\"...one theory has it that Usan-do and Ulleung-do are the same island...\\" as described in Donggug Yeoji Seunglam (1481).下条正男(Prof. Shimojyo) 諸君！2007年9月号 p98\\"その結果、東国輿地志には「一説に言う、于山鬱稜島本一島」とあったことがわかった。(As a result, it turned out that Yeojiji stated as \\"Usan-do and Ulleung-do are spoken of as the same island, too.\\")\\" 19th-century maps Usando is displayed on the cartographs made by Chong Sang-gi (1678~1752); Haejwa Jeondo (1822), and Dongguk Jeondo (by Kim Tae-gon, 1821–1846). Japanese believe it to be Jukdo, noting the distance, shape, size, and direction., See Map which is on this page and part of the \\"竹島問題\\" site while Koreans believe it to be Liancourt and they said that Usando was a former name of Liancourt. In 2011, Usando is found on the Kim Jeong-ho's Daedong Yeojido. 1877 Daijō-kan order to exclude Takeshima (Ulleungdo) and another island from Japanese National Land Registry On March 20, 1877, the Japanese Supreme Council Daijō-kan issued an order stating that Ulleungdo (then called \\"Takeshima 竹島\\", now called Matsushima 松島 by Japan) and another island (外一島) are not under Japanese rule.

(http://i815.or.kr/media_data/thesis/1989/198902.html) Korea states that \\"another island\\" (外一島) besides Ulleungdo refers to Liancourt Rocks Shin, Yong Ha, \\"磯竹島一ニ竹島ト稱ス. 隱岐國ノ乾位一百二拾里許ニ在ス. 周回凡九(sic.)十里許山峻嶮ニシテ平地少シ. 川三條アリ. 又瀑布アリ. 然レトモ深谷幽邃樹竹稠密其源ヲ知ル能ハス...動物ニハ 海鹿 ...就中海鹿鮑ヲ物産ノ最トス. ...又海鹿一頭能ク數斗ノ油ヲ得ヘシ. 次ニ一島アリ松島ト呼フ. 周回三十町許竹島ト同一線路ニ在リ. 隱岐ヲ距ル八拾里許 樹竹稀ナリ. 亦魚獸ヲ産ス.\\" \\"Isotakeshima is also called 'Takeshima' (modern Matsushima, Ulleung Island). It is located 120 ri (里 here is kairi 浬/海里 or nautical mile of 1.852km; 120 x 1.852km = 222.24 km) to the north of Okikuni. Its circumference is around 10 ri (里 here is unit of distance 3.927km; 10 x 3.927 = 39.27 km); its slopes are steep, and flatlands few. There are three streams and even a waterfall. The bamboos and trees are dense in the deep ravines, and where they begin is unknowable...(Among the catch,) the most abundant are sea lions and abalones... Furthermore, several tomasu (斗 refers to a volume roughly equivalent to 5 gallons) of oil is to be got from one head of sea lion. Next is an island called 'Matsushima 松島' (modern Takeshima, Dokdo or Liancourt Rocks). Its circumference is roughly 30 chou (町 109 m; 30 chou is ca 3.27 km), which is on the same sea route as 'Takeshima 竹島' (modern Matsushima or Ulleung Island). It is roughly 80 ri (80 x 1.852km = 148.16 km) from Oki.

On Oct 16, same year (明治九年十月十六日), Shimane Prefecture submitted relevant documents including a map inquiring after guidelines on dealing with two islets instead (竹島外一島). The map called A Rough Map of Isotakeshima 磯竹島略圖 (http://www.dokdo-takeshima.com/wordpress/wp- content/images/1877-docmap-1.jpg), which came from the Otani (大谷) clan of Shimane, shows Isotakeshima (磯竹島; today's Ulleung Island) and Matsushima (まつしま 松島; today's Dokdo or Liancourt Rocks) exclusively in addition to the northern tip of Okishima. This map shared by Shimane Prefecture, the Internal Ministry, and the Supreme Council (Daijō-kan) can mean only that they were in an unambiguous agreement on which island they meant by 'another island 外一島': 'Matsushima 松島', which has since been renamed Takeshima 竹島 also known as Liancourt Rocks and Dokdo.\\" Translation of the annexed text: \\"Isonotakeshima (Ulleungdo) is also called Takeshima. It is 120 ri (222km) northwest of Oki. The island is about 10 ri (40km) around....Next there is another island which is called Matsushima (Dokdo). The area of this island is approximately 30 chongbo (73 acres) and is on the same straight latitude as Ulleungdo. It is 80 ri (148km) from Oki. Trees and bamboo are scarce, sea lions live there.\\" The distance given here is in ri (리,り,里) There were two forms of ri used at this time in Japan. One was a standard ri of 4km (Used for land measurements). It was used in the circumference of Ulleungdo in this document (10 里 = 40km). The other was a nautical ri or nautical mile which equalled 1.852 meters. Nautical 里 or miles are/were used in international law and treaties especially regarding the limit of territorial waters. There can be no doubt given the location, name, and description the island referred to in this document was today´s Dokdo. The ratio of the real distances in kilometers and the distances in 里 on the 1877 document are about the same. 120里:80里 (distance on 1877 document ratio=.66) 240km:157km (actual distance ratio in km =.65) and considers this order as an evidence that Liancourt Rocks was under the control of Korea. The Japanese government has not made any comment on this point whereas some Japanese consider that \\"another island\\" (外一島) does not refer to Liancourt Rocks.Japanese(http://www.pref.shimane.lg.jp/admin/pref/takeshima/web- takeshima/takeshima04/takeshima04-2/takeshima04-o.html) Prof. Shimojo Masao's reference to the 1881 survey is out of context as the designation of the two islands are quite different: \\"As a matter of fact, Matsushima as 'another island' in Dajoukan order turned out to be today's Ulleundo three years later (1880), and 'Takeshima' in the order was identified as today's Jukdo which locates 2km east of Ulleundo until 1881.\\" The 1876–1877 documents of Dajoukan and the Ministry of Home Affairs clearly demonstrate that, at the time of the investigation of the islands based on historical documents, \\"Takeshima\\" refers to modern Ulleung-do and \\"Matsushima\\", modern Liancourt Rocks. 1900 Korean Imperial Decree No. 41 separates Uldo Archipelago from Uljin County On October 25, 1900, Korea issued Imperial Decree No. 41, which included the following administrative actions. :* Ulleungdo, which had been subordinate to Uljin PrefectureUljin Prefecture was elevated to Uljin County in May 1895, as part of the Gabo Reform, and was subordinated to Gang'neung Bu-county. since the reign of King Sejong, shall be renamed Uldo and elevated to county. :* Uldo County office shall rule over all of Uldo proper and its dependencies including Jukdo and Seokdo. The decree was published in Official Gazette No. 1716 (관보 제1716호) on Oct 27 and distributed to the international community, including Imperial Japan, with representations in Seoul. Shin, Yong Ha, describes the circumstances that culminated in the 1900 Imperial Decree No. 41 and makes a brief reference to a 1904 account of Liancourt Rocks by the crew of the Japanese warship Niitakago during the Russo-Japanese War. \\"대한제국이 1900년 칙령 제41호로 독도(石島:석도, 獨島)의 울도군수 행정관리를 통한 영유를 중앙정부의 관보에 게재한 것은 '국제적 고시'의 성격을 갖는다. 왜냐하면 중앙정부 관보는 의무적으로 대한제국의 체약국 공사관에 발송되고, 각국 공사관도 이 중앙정부의 관보를 반드시 보기 때문이다. 따라서 대한제국의 1900년 칙령 제41호의 관보 고시는 대한제국이 울릉도와 독도의 영유를 재선언한 것이었다. '재선언'이라고 한 것은 이미 15세기에 '동국여지승람'에서 우산도(독도)의 조선 영유가 당시 조선의 교역국가에 선언됐기 때문이다.\\" This decree states that Ulleungdo be renamed to Uldo (mod. Ulleungdo), and that the county hall shall govern Ulleungdo, Jukdo, and Seokdo.These islands are being transferred from Uljin County to Uldo County (mod. Ulleung County). According to Geographical Treatise, Annals of King Sejong, Gangwon Province, Uljin Prefecture, the islands of Usan and Mulung are in the Eastern Sea; they are close enough to be visible from each other on a clear day. During the Shilla period, they were called Usan'gug or Ulleungdo. July 13, 1906, edition of the daily, Hwang Seong Shinmun, reported: \\"The [Japanese] Resident-General sent an official letter to the [Korean] Ministry of the Interior asking for a clarification as to which islands belonged to Ulleung (sic.) Island, which was (sic.) under the administration of Samcheok County (sic) in Gangwon Province, and which year and month the County Office was established. The response was that the post of Ulleungdo Directorate was established on May 20, 1898, and that the County Magistrate was stationed on October 25, 1900, as a result of the government's decision. The County seat is at Taehadong (태하동 台霞洞), with islands of Jukdo (竹島) and Seokdo (石島). [The Island of Uldo] measures sixty ri from east to west and forty ri from north to south with a circumference of 200 ri in total.\\" Japan says that there is no evidence to identify the island \\"Seokdo\\" as Liancourt Rocks,See 2. Background (5) and (6). Note the misrepresentation of Sokdo (석도 石島) as \\"Ishi-jima\\"; as a credible governmental document offered to English speakers, the island should have been referred to as \\"Seokdo\\" in the current standard of romanisation of a Korean place name. This error, however, is corrected, on page 9 in the Feb 2008 MOFA document, \\"10 Issues of Takeshima\\". ()Japanese(http://www.pref.shimane.lg.jp/admin/pref/takeshima/web- takeshima/takeshima04/takeshima04-2/takeshima04_q.html) Shimojo Masao claims it is impossible for \\"Seokdo\\" 石島 to be Liancourt Rocks because the figures given for Uldo Island in the 1906 Hwangseong Shinmun report correspond to a circumference of 200 ri, which can not cover the distance to \\"Seokdo\\", 87 to 92 km away from Uldo Island depending on tide levels. and that there is no record that proves the effective occupation by Korea before Japanese Cabinet decision of January 28, 1905. Korea claims that the island \\"Seokdo\\" mentioned in this document is Liancourt Rocks, and thus Liancourt Rocks was still officially part of Korea as an ancient territory since 512. Korea presents evidence that Koreans living on Ulleungdo referred to Liancourt Rocks as Dokseom (or Dolseom; literally \\"rocky island\\") in speech and Dokdo 獨島 in writing as a phonetic transcription (음독 音讀, umdok; おんよみ 音読み on-yomi), while the name \\"Seokdo\\" 石島 (\\"rocky island\\") in the Ordinance was an instance of logographic translation (훈독, 訓讀, hundok; くんよみ 訓読み kun-yomi).The truth of Dokdo: Comments by the Northeast Asian History Foundation \\"대한제국 정부는 칙령 제41호에서 울릉도 주민들의 호칭인 '독섬'을 의역하여 '石島'라 한 것이다. '독섬'을 뜻을 취해 한자 표기하면 '石島'가 되고, 발음을 취해 한자 표기하면 '獨島'가 되는 것이다.\\" \\"대한제국 정부가 칙령 제41조를 발표할 때 각 섬의 명칭을 약간씩 수정했는데, 울릉도를 울도라 개칭하고, 죽서도를 죽도라고 했으며, 우산도에 대한 어민들의 명칭인 '독섬' '독도'를 의역해 한자로 '石島'로 번역 표기했다.\\" \\"\\" (석도(石島)는 어느 섬을 가리키는 것일까. 우선 울릉전도(鬱陵全島), 즉 울릉본도(鬱陵本島)와 이에 부속된 작은 섬·바위들과 죽도를 제외하고 나면, 울릉도 주변에 잇는 도서로서는 오직 오늘의 독도(獨島)가 남을 뿐이다. 또 석도를 훈독(訓讀)하면 '독섬' 혹은 '돌섬'이 되는데, 지금도 울릉도 주민들은 독도를 '독섬' 혹은 '돌섬'이라 부르고 있다. 이렇게 볼 때 이 제2조 후단의 석도는 바로 독도를 가리키는 것이다. 1906년 (광무 10)에 울도군수(鬱島郡守) 심흥택(沈興澤)이 강원도관찰사 서리 이명래(李明來)에게 보낸 보고서에서 '독도운운(獨島云云)'한 독도16) 는 이 석도, 즉 '독섬'에서 차음(借音)한 것이라 하겠다.) Korea also states that Liancourt Rocks was effectively managed by seasonal fishermen and divers in recent times as a result of King Gojong's Ulleungdo Reclamation Program (鬱陵島開拓令) issued in Dec 1881. A first-person account by one of the first settlers since the reclamation program has been presented as one evidence to the fact of the claim.Kazuo Hori, \\"Japan's Incorporation of Takeshima into Its Territory in 1905\\", Korea Observer Vol XXVII, No 3, Autumn 1997, p. 509, quotes Hong Chae-hyon (홍재현; born 1862) who moved to this island in 1883, who recalled [in 1947], \\"at the time of the development [in the 1880s], the people on Ulleungdo discovered Tokdo immediately, and went to Tokdo many times to harvest kelp (konbu) and abalone and to catch sea lions. I myself went there several dozens of times.\\" Taehan Gongnonsa (Korean Public Information Service), ed., Tokdo (Seoul: 1965), p. 30 A South Korean scholar claims to have uncovered evidence that Korean fishermen effectively occupied engaged in \\"whaling\\" in Liancourt Rocks waters in the 1880s and that sea lions were hunted and sea-lion-derived products were exported to Japan in 1904 prior to the Japanese Cabinet decision of 1905 to incorporate a supposed terra nullius. 1904 Japan–Korea treaty The Japan–Korea Protocol of 1904 (; ) signed between Japan and Korea on February 23, 1904, stipulates in article 3 that Japan shall guarantee the territorial integrity of Korea. It further stipulates in article 4 that, in case the territorial integrity of Korea is endangered by aggression of a third power, Korea shall give full facilities to promote the action of Japan, and that Japan may occupy, when the circumstances require, such places as may be necessary for strategic reasons. Article 4 of the treaty has been quoted as giving Japan full authorisation in terms of international law in taking Liancourt Rocks as a strategic surveillance point during the Russo-Japanese War.Kazuo Hori, \\"Japan's Incorporation of Takeshima into Its Territory in 1905\\", Korea Observer Vol XXVII, No 3, Autumn 1997, p. 511: \\"The Japanese government ... made the Korean government acknowledge in the Korea-Japan protocol that Japan would temporarily expropriate the places needed for military purposes.\\"Tanaka Kunitaka 竹島の島根県編入 in 1905, \\"確かに竹島の編入は日韓議定書からの連続した侵略過程とも採らえることが出来る。\\" p. 19, \\"Korea was forced to sign a treaty of protocol which provided, among other things: \\"Japan shall temporarily expropriate places considered necessary for military purposes.\\" This clause applied to the lease of fishing grounds to Nakai, a fisherman from Shimane prefecture. Tokdo, thus leased, was finally incorporated into Okinoshima in Shimane prefecture on February 22, 1905, when Japan's victory became decisive after the sea battle of Port Arthur on February 8.\\" Article 3, however, has been quoted as preventing Japan from appropriating Liancourt Rocks post bellum, and hence ruling the 1905 Shimane incorporation illegal after the end of the war. \\"한일의정서는 대한제국의 독립을 박탈하려는 데는 이르지 못했다. 실제로 한일의정서 제 3조에도 \\"대일본제국정부는 대한제국의 독립과 영토보전을 확실히 보증할 것\\"이라고 명확히 명기했다. 하지만 일본은 다음해인 1905년 2월 22일 독도를 일본령으로 편입 결정하는 조치를 단행함으로써 스스로 명기한 대한제국의 영토보전 약속을 어겼다. 대다수 전문가들은 여기에 일본의 독도 영유권 주장의 가장 큰 허점이 있다고 주장한다. 고려대 한국사학과 정태헌 교수는 \\"독립국 대한제국 영토를 일본이 자국령으로 편입시켰다면 이는 독립국의 영토를 조약도 없이 강제로 약탈한 것으로 당연히 국제법 위반\\"이라고 지적했다.\\"Article 4 of the Japan-Korea Protocol was to continue in force even after the signing of the Eulsa Treaty of November 17, 1905, which states in Article 4: \\"The stipulations of all treaties existing between Japan and Korea not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement shall continue in force.\\" The text of the Eulsa Treaty can be found below in full. Although the watch tower on Liancourt Rocks was demolished, suggesting the necessity on strategic reasons had disappeared, the Japanese Cabinet decision to incorporate Liancourt Rocks had not been revoked in violation of the treaty. This suggests foreign military threat from a third country in Article 4 was not the primary ground of incorporating Liancourt Rocks, p. 27, \\"[Japan's] Foreign Ministry states: \\" Article 4 of the Korean- Japanese Protocol originally provided for temporary expropriation of places strategically deemed necessary for the preservation of Korea's territorial integrity during the Russo-Japanese War and had nothing to do with the incorporation of Tokdo.\\" end note 95: Japan Foreign Ministry, Kaigai chosa geppo (Overseas Research Monthly), Nov. 1954. but South Korea claim that \\"its own violence and greed that Japan is expected to disprove with prima facie evidence in the manner of which the act of incorporation was committed.\\" p. 37, \\"So far as the \\"incorporation\\" or \\"prior occupation\\" of Tokdo by Japan is presumed to have been an act of seizure or aggression against Korea's title, Japan should prove this prima facie evidence that the act was not committed by \\"violence and greed.\\" Unless this burden of proof is removed, Japan should find itself bound by the \\"restrictive character\\" under international agreements (Cairo Declatation-Postam Declaration-Surrender instruments) as shown in the Frontier case. Here, the relative strength of evidence, seen in the Minquiers and Ecrehos case, to contradistinguish evidence does not apply.\\" 1905 Japanese incorporation of Liancourt Rocks The imperial government of Japan incorporated Liancourt Rocks as a result of a Cabinet decision in early 1905. Three motives are commonly cited for this decision: * civilian occupation of said islets by a Japanese citizen from Oki, Nakai Yozaburo (なかい よざぶろう 中井養三郎; 1864–1934), * practical necessities arising from the armed conflict with Russia, * and Japan's foreign policy regarding Korea as its western frontier to fend off encroaching foreign powers. The incorporation was conducted incognito to foreign nations, including Korea, as the decision had never been announced by the central government to the international community. The Korean response to reports of the verbal notice by a local Japanese official were shock and disbelief, and orders were issued to investigate the truth of the report. While the result of the investigation is obscured in silence, apparently lending momentum to the Japanese claim, the Japanese Resident-General residing in Seoul, in 1906, makes an inquiry into which islands are administered by Ulleungdo (sic.), in the older designation prior to the 1900 Korean Imperial Decree No 40, to which the Internal Ministry relays facts consistent with the 1900 Imperial Decree No 41, to wit Uldo County administers Uldo proper, Jukdo, and Seokdo. =1903–1904 Nakai's fishing enterprise= On September 29, 1904, Nakai Yozaburo (; 1864–1934) of Saigo, Shimane Prefecture, experimenting with sea lion hunting business in the summers of 1903 and 1904, and wanting to protect his investment, submitted a petition to incorporate Liancourt Rocks and to issue exclusive license to hunt sea lions for ten years. The petition was submitted to the Home Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Nakai, initially believing Liancourt Rocks to be Korean territory, had planned to ask for a lease from the Korean government via the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. Codified from manuscript by Takeshima Institute of Shimane Prefecture.Photographic reproduction of the 1923 publication. An officer of the Ministry of Home Affairs considered it unwise to incorporate Liancourt Rocks, as it was suspected to be Korean territory, but the Navy and the Foreign Ministry advised incorporation would be profitable, and that there would arise no diplomatic repercussions. August 28, 2005 article from interview with Shimojo Masao. March 7, 2007 article.A draft translation. Compiled by Mark Lovmo; see bibliography for sources. The text has been identified as that of Kazuo Hori's from \\"Japan's Incorporation of Takeshima into Its Territory in 1905\\", Korea Observer Vol XXVII, No 3, Autumn 1997, conveyed by Steve Barber. =1905 Japanese cabinet decision on Liancourt Rocks= The Japanese government's official view has evolved since 1905. On January 28, 1905, the Cabinet reached a decision ( ) to incorporate Liancourt Rocks , on grounds that it had been terra nullius under international law:Shin, Yong Ha, describes the circumstances of the 1905 Cabinet Decision 下條正男・拓殖大教授「ポイントは二つある。まず、竹島を他国が占領したと認められる形跡がないことを確認した。さらに、中井の漁業会社が小屋を構えていることを、国際法上の占領の事実とした。これらのことから、竹島を『無主先占』の地であると判断した」 Prof. Shimojo Masao of Takushoku University said, \\"There are only two points. First, it has been confirmed there is no evidence to recognise the occupation of Takeshima by any other country. Second, Nakai's fishing company has constructed a shed there; this is a fact of occupation under international law . From these facts, [the Japanese government] determined Takeshima is to have been subject to prior occupation of a terra nullius (無主先占).\\" \\"The Japanese claim to have incorporated Liancourt – land they considered to be terra nullius – into Shimane Prefecture on February 22, 1905.\\" Professor Kim Myung- Ki summarises: \\"The Japanese government stated on Feb 10, 1954, that Japan['s] announcing [of] prior occupation of territory ... has satisfied the requisite conditions under international law,\\" MOFA of Korea, Tokdo kwan'gye charyojip (Collection of Data on Tokdo) (I) Wangbok oegyio munso (Diplomatic Correspondence Exchanged); Chipmu charyo (Reference Material for Staff), (Seoul: MFA, 1997), p. 55 \\"There is no recognizable trace that this uninhabited island was ever occupied by a foreign country... As evidenced through relevant records that a person by the name of Nakai Yozaburo () moved to said island in 1903 (Meiji 36) and practiced fishing there since, we recognise the fact that occupation has occurred in terms of international law.\\" \\"明治三十八年一月二十八日閣議決定 ... 無人島ハ他國ニ於テ之ヲ占領シタリト認ムヘキ形迹ナク、... 依テ審査スルニ明治三十六年以來中井養三郞ナル者該島ニ移住シ漁業ニ從事セルコトハ關係書類ニ依リ明ナル所ナルハ國際法上占領ノ事實アルモノト認メ.\\" From 1947 to 1954, the Japanese government's claim shifted from prior occupation of a terra nullius to effective occupation by \\"executing state intention to acquire territory\\". Not later than 1962, Japan again shifted its claim to \\"[the 1905] reconfirmation of title to an inherent/ancient territory\\", all based on Japan's changing interpretation of the same Cabinet decision document, all the while carefully avoiding its previous claim of incorporation on grounds of prior occupation of a terra nullius.MOFA of Korea, Tokdo kwan'gye charyojip (Collection of Data on Tokdo) (I) Wangbok oegyio munso (Diplomatic Correspondence Exchanged); Chipmu charyo (Reference Material for Staff), (Seoul: MFA, 1997), pp. 234, 236, 250 via Kim, Myung-Ki, A Study of Legal Aspects of Japan's Claim to Tokdo, Korea Observer, Autumn 1997, p. 361, MOFA of Japan stated in a memorandum of July 3, 1962, \\"The Japanese government has made clear the position of its claim that Takeshima is Japan's inherent territory from olden times and is now reconfirming repeatedly that position.\\" Korea also claims that Japan's 1905 claim to terra nullius conflicts with its previous recognition (i.e., the 1877 Daijō-kan order) of the islets as Korean territory. =1905 Shimane Notice 40= Japan claims to have enforced its Cabinet decision of January 28, 1905, to incorporate the islets as part of Shimane Prefecture () in Shimane Prefectural Notice No. 40 of February 22, 1905 (). a cleaned-up text lacking the various seals and handwritten figures The decision was reported in a local newspaper, San-in Shimbun, on February 24, 1905. The incorporation came in the heat of the Russo-Japanese War and before the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 of November 17, 1905, when Korea became Japan's protectorate. A temporary watchtower was erected on the islets for anti-Russian surveillance purposes, which was demolished after Japan's victory in the war. =1906 verbal notification of incorporation and Korean response= Japanese claims the incorporation was legitimate in that Korea did not dispute the incorporation when the news was published.Hongo, Jun, \\"Island row with South Korea rooted in rival historic claims\\", Japan Times, September 5, 2012, p. 3 Korea claims the incorporation was invalid in that the Feb 24 San-in Shimbun report lacked official status as its circulation was limited to the Shimane prefectural region. Korea claims neither the decision of the Japanese Cabinet, the order of Ministry of Home Affairs, nor the Shimane Notice had been announced to the Korean government until March 28, 1906. Many Japanese, including petitioner Nakai Yozaburo (), and certain governmental officials believed the title of Liancourt Rocks belonged to Korea. On that date, a party of 44 officials from Shimane Prefecture visited Ulleungdo. The Japanese officials, including Kanda Yoshitaro, travelled to Ulleungdo by way of Dokdo, and informed Sim Heung-taek, then Magistrate of Ulleungdo, that the rocks had been incorporated into Japan. According to Korean historians, Sim immediately contacted Yi Myeong-nae, then Governor of Gangwon Province. Yi then forwarded the report to the State Council Minister of the Korean Empire. State Council Minister Bak Je-sun, in Directive No. 3 issued on May 20, 1906, stated, \\"It is totally groundless that Dokdo has become Japanese territory,\\" and went on to order \\"an investigation and report on the situation and on what the Japanese have done.\\" The Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 had stripped Korea of all its diplomatic rights on November 17, 1905.Emperor Gojong's letter to German Kaiser discoveredPainful, significant landmark, Joongangdaily, June 23, 2008 Five years later, Korea was fully annexed by Japan. =1906 communication between Japanese Resident-General and the Korean government= A curious inquiry and reply are exchanged between Japanese and Korean officials, the result of which is reported in the edition of July 13 of Hwangseong Shinmun. In the letter, says the report, the Japanese Resident-General asks which islands are administered by Ulleung Island. The Korean Home Ministry simply lists the same islands as in the 1900 Decree specifying Seokdo, which Korea claims to be Liancourt Rocks. It also adds a physical measurement of what is believed to be Ulleung Island.The interpretation of this report has ignited some controversy, the published articles of the participants of which are listed in the following, arranged in chronological order. The Japanese inquiry is not current with the 1900 Korean Decree in its inaccurate designation of place names and offices, while the Korean reply remains silent on the issue of incorporation of Liancourt Rocks. The details of the reasons for the Resident-General's inquiry and the Korean government's judgement regarding the inquiry are not known. Prior to the Resident-General's inquiry and the Korean government's response reported on July 13, daily newspapers Hwangseong Shinmun (May 9, 1906) and Daehan Maeil Sinbo (May 1, 1906) had denied the rumoured Japanese local official's claim of incorporating Liancourt Rocks. \\"their claim to Dokdo as Japanese territory is totally groundless; the story is really shocking.\\"Japan's Incorporation of Takeshima into Its Territory in 1905, by Kazuo Hori \\"It is certain that many Korean people learned through this newspaper coverage of the Japanese move to incorporate Takeshima/Tokdo into its territory and must have read it as an aggression into Korean territory. For example, Hwang Hyon who lived in Kurye, Chollado, at that time writes in a note that \\"the Japanese are making a false statement that Tokdo belongs to Japan while it is our own territory.\\" Although Hwangseong Shinmun had clearly declared that rumours of the Japanese incorporation of Liancourt Rocks were baseless two months before the July communication,Dokdo: Korean Territory Since the Sixth Century, koreaembassy.org and although the July communication reminded the Resident- General, Itou Hirobumi, of the 1900 Imperial Decree reaffirming Korea's state authority over Liancourt Rocks, there is no evidence that the then Resident- General or any other representation of Imperial Japan raised a formal objection to it. 1920 Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in exile In a memorial speech at the first anniversary of the 1919 March 1st Movement, Prime Minister Yi Dongnyeong accused the Japanese government of illegal incorporation of Liancourt Rocks of 1905.金学俊, 『独島/竹島韓国の論理』, 論創社, 2007, . p.157 Post World War II era The recent dispute stems largely from conflicting interpretations of whether Japan's renunciation of sovereignty over its occupied territories after World War II included the Liancourt Rocks. Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP) Instruction #677 of January 29, 1946, listed the Liancourt Rocks, along with many other islands, as part of those territories over which Japanese administration was to be suspended. In the first to fifth drafts of the Treaty of San Francisco between Japan and the Allied powers, Liancourt Rocks was described as part of Korea. The sixth and seventh drafts, made on December 29, 1949, and August 7, 1950, respectively, ruled that Liancourt Rocks belonged to Japan. The U.K. draft and the attached map reflecting the view of Commonwealth nations, p. 9: \\"The Canberra Conference was held among the Commonwealth countries in August 1947 to discuss a peace treaty with Japan. Before signing a peace treaty which would determine the final position of territories as a result of the war, Japan had to appeal to the nations concerned.\\" \\"At the suggestion of the United Kingdom and Australian Governments, a meeting of British Commonwealth countries was held at Canberra at the end of August 1947 in order to exchange views as a preliminary to an international conference about the peace settlement with Japan. The meeting was attended by delegations from Australia, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan and Burma.\\" submitted April 7, 1951, excluded Liancourt Rocks from Japanese territorial definition and placed Liancourt Rocks within Korean territory: :\\"Japanese sovereignty shall continue over all the islands and adjacent islets and rocks lying within an area bounded by a line ... bearing north-easterly between ... the islands of Oki- Retto to the south-east and Take Shima to the north-west\\". Finally, the U.K. agreed to the US version of the treaty excluding the islands of Quelpart, Port Hamilton and Dagelet from Japan. During the discussions in Washington, the British agreed to drop this proposal when the U.S. pointed to the psychological disadvantages of seeming to fence Japan in by a continuous line around Japan. The Japanese had objected to the British proposal when it was discussed with them in Tokyo. U.S. willingness to specify in the treaty that Korean territory included Quelpart, Port Hamilton and Dagelet also helped to persuade the British. The final version left the territorial title of Liancourt Rocks undefined between Japan and signatory states. :Article 1 ::(b) The Allied Powers recognize the full sovereignty of the Japanese people over Japan and its territorial waters. :Article 2 ::(a) Japan recognizing the independence of Korea, renounces all right, title and claim to Korea, including the islands of Quelpart, Port Hamilton and Dagelet. Korea claims that its territorial title to Liancourt Rocks was returned to Korea with the surrender of Japan which was enforced by SCAP's prohibitions suspending Japanese access to within from said island \\"On June 22, 1946 SCAPIN No. 1033 was issued in which Clause 5 set up the fishing and whaling areas permitted for Japanese fishermen and prohibited Japanese ships and crews from entering the seas off the Liancourt Rocks at 37°15\\" N. latitude and 131°53\\"E. longitude and approaching the island.\\" which needs to be explicitly revoked in order to effect a change.. \\"Clause 5 of the instruction provides that 'the definition of the Japan contained in the directive shall also apply to all future directives, memoranda and orders from the Headquarters unless otherwise specified therein.' Therefore, without another specific instruction by SCAP this definition could not be changed and would continue to be binding.\\" Such a change modifying the status of Liancourt Rocks has never occurred before \\"SCAP transferred its jurisdiction... to the United States Army Military Government in Korea on January 29, 1946.\\" The U.S. Military Government in Korea, in turn, reverted all jurisdiction over Liancourt Rocks to the Government of South Korea when it launched on August 15, 1948.. \\"In accordance with this instruction, SCAP transferred the jurisdiction over Tokdo to the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea on January 29, 1946. When the Republic of Korea was proclaimed on August 15, 1948, all the territories of Korea, including Tokdo, automatically reverted to the Korean government.\\" South Korea's President Rhee Syngman's announcement of the Peace Line enforced Korea's territorial title to Liancourt Rocks. US recognition of this format of treaty was Japan recovered full sovereignty under article 1 except islands which were excluded from Japan by name. The Americans would prefer a wording which emphasized the full sovereignty of Japan such territory as we should leave her and, exclude by name from her sovereignty and only such territory and islands as might be necessary to avoid confusion. =Early Japanese efforts to claim Liancourt Rocks and Ulleung Island= Both countries submitted petitions and documents to persuade the Allied Powers to rule Liancourt Rocks in their favour. The Japanese government's Foreign Office submitted a series of documents, issued from November 1946 to June 1947, entitled Minor Islands Adjacent to Japan Proper; Parts I-IV, of which Part IV, Minor Islands in the Pacific, Minor Islands in the Sea of Japan described Utsuryo-shima (Ulleungdo) and Take-shima (Dokdo, Liancourt Rocks) as Japanese territory.1947/6 [USNARA/894.014/9-2347] Yonhap News, February 8, 2005 Korea Times, February 27, 2005 Jung Byung-Joon, Korea Focus, 13:4 July–August 2005, pp 55–81, gives a detailed account of the comprehensive efforts of the Japanese Foreign Office Treaty Department and the Executive Committee for Research on the Peace Treaty and William Sebald's role in the exchange of national needs of Japan and the US in the negotiating process.

Educated neither as an historian nor a geographer, went on to build on this early investigation supporting the Japanese claim in a work called 竹島の歴史地理学的研究, 川上 健三, , May 1966, 古今書院; 復刻新装版版 for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs published in 1966, in which he said: :* Koreans on Ulleungdo could not see the Liancourt Rocks, due to the heavy forestation on Ulleungdo :* Koreans were not aware of the Liancourt Rocks before the 20th century, as seen in the lack of documents pertaining to the Liancourt Rocks :* Koreans did not have adequate naval navigation to reach the Liancourt Rocks. Adherents including , , and Gerry Bevers have presented arguments building on Kawakami's arguments. Recent studies by numerous Korean and Japanese scholars such as Baek In-ki (백인기), Shim Mun-bo (심문보), Yu Mirim (유미림), Lee Han-key (이한기), Wada Haruki 和田春樹, and Jeong Taeman (정태만) have disproved many of the claims. :* Visibility of Liancourt Rocks from Ulleungdo is attested in history , \\"1451년(문종 원년)에 편찬된 『고려사지리지』에는 \\"울릉도가 (울진)현 정동쪽 바다 가운데에 있다. 신라 때에는 우산국이라 칭했고, 무릉, 우릉이라고도 한다. ... 일설에는 우산 무릉은 원래 두개의 섬으로 거리가 서로 멀지 않아 날씨가 맑으면 바라보는 것이 가능하다.(有鬱陵島 在縣正東海中 新羅時稱于山國 一云武陵 一云羽陵 ... 一云于山武陵本二島 相距不遠 風日淸明 則可望見(「高麗史」 권58 地理3, 東界 蔚珍縣條)\\" \\"우산(于山)과 무릉(武陵) 2 섬이 현의 정동(正東) 해중(海中)에 있다. 2 섬이 서로 거리가 멀지 아니하여, 날씨가 맑으면 가히 바라볼 수 있다.\\" pp. 101–102 \\"Jang, Han-Sang wrote that both an island (Dokdo) and Daegwan Pass (on the mainland) are visible from Mt Seong'in, to the southeast at 300 ri and to the west respectively...Facts and Evidence of Ulleungdo by Jang, Han-Sang, records a visual description of Liancourt Rocks from Seong'in Mt.: 'To the southeast of Ulleungdo at a distance of some 300 ri lies an island not quite one third the dimensions of Ulleungdo.'

Korean naval superiority before Japanese modernization was proven during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). =Early Korean efforts to claim Liancourt Rocks as an appendage or dependency to Ulleung Island= A corresponding Korean effort came from a private organization self-styled \\"Patriotic Old Men's Association\\" led by a former military leader of the Korean Government in Exile, Cho Sung Hwan, on August 5, 1948, ten days before the inauguration of the South Korean government.The absence of the identification as the Korean Government in Exile or the Interim Korean Government is because the United States Army Military Government in Korea had declared itself the only legitimate government on the Korean peninsula, rendering illegal any other existing government claiming sovereignty over Korea. \\"In south Korea numerous political parties sprang up. As early as August 16, 1945, some Koreans formed a Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence, and Yo Unhyong (Lyuh Woonhyung: 1885–1947) organized the left-wing Korean People's Republic (KPR). But on entering south Korea, the American commander Lt. Gen. Hodge declined to acknowledge any sort of political organization, stressing that USAMGIK was the 'only' government. USAMGIK suppressed any kind of political movement from above, disbanded the People's Committees, ordered the KPR dissolved, and annulled the Provisional Government, headed by the nationalist leader Kim Ku.\\" pp. 23–24: \\"To be fair to the Americans, Hodge's task to maintain order was vague: 'suppress activities of individuals and organizations which may be inimical to the operations of the occupation force.' Hodge also had the military task to receive the surrender of Japanese forces, disarm them, and repatriate them as soon as possible. Beyond that, his mandate for political, social, or economic reconstruction was ambiguous.17 As a result, circumstances forced Hodge to play for time, which had nearly catastrophic results. Immediately upon Japan's capitulation, fearful colonial officials in Korea had attempted strike a deal with prominent Koreans. They convinced a moderate Korean, Yo Un-hyong, to accept responsibility for maintaining order while awaiting the tardy Americans. Yo agreed, but only under conditions that would exclude any Japanese or pro-Japanese Korean from exercising influence or power.18 From Liberation Day (August 15) to September 8, Yo and his left- leaning organization, the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence, effectively governed Korea and managed to control violence while planting the seeds of national feeling. On September 6, Yo's partisans even declared the birth of the Korean People's Republic.19 This act unsettled Hodge's sense of good order, particularly as military, quasi-military, youth group organizations that answered to no central authority proliferated. In any event, the United States Army Forces in Korea (USAFIK), which included both the XXIV Corps and the military government, was supposed to be the central authority, and Hodge wanted to make sure there was little doubt of that. To erase any doubts, Hodge unceremoniously dumped Yo, explaining 'There is only one government in South Korea – the United States Army Military Government.'20\\" They petitioned for the sovereignty of Docksum (Liancourt Rocks), Ullung Do, Tsushima and Parang islands1948/9 [USNARA/894.014/9-1648] A reproduction of a verbatim copy made by the Office of POLAD (Political Advisor of Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers). The title page properly identifies the nature of the document as formally unofficial yet reflecting the dominant Korean view. The Headquarters of the Patriotic Men's Association made the following statements to back up Korea's claim to sovereignty over Ulleung Is and Liancourt Rocks: :* Request for Arrangement of Lands between Korea and Japan :* I. Returning ... the island \\"Docksum.\\" ::* \\"'Ulneungdo' and its attached ... belong... to Korea historically.\\" ::* \\"Japan planned to profit by fishing and foresting under the evacuation policy.\\" ::* \\"Resolute negotiation... Japan acknowledged their fault and made a word to prohibit to fish there in 1693.\\" ::* \\"Since 1881, Japan began to reinvade... Under the negotiations in Tokyo... by plenipotentiary Suh Sang Woo and ... advisior G. von Mollendorf, Japan surrendered to Korea.\\" ::* Japan, never dismiss[ing] the fishing profit around Ulneungdo, ... planned to occupy a corner of it... and became to find out a small island called 'Docksum'... near the Ulneungdo, where whales gathered.\\" ::* \\"In 1904, a Japanese fisher of Tottoriken named Nakai Yosaburo made a cruel program to seize the Docksum and ... submit[ed] petitions or requests to the Hydrographic Department of Navy, Dep't of Home Affairs, Dep't of Foreign Affairs and Dep't of Agriculture and Commerce... to register the island into Japanese territory.\\" ::* \\"The so-called Takeshima is the very Dockusum (sic) in Korean name.\\" ::* \\"This is namely Liancourt Rocks on the world's chart.\\" ::* \\"This name \\"Liancourt-Rocks\\" was established due to the name of the French whaler which found... the island. Thereafter, by the Russian warship 'Paleada' in 1854, and by the English warship \\"Hornet\\" in 1855, the said island was re-found and the ship's name was given to it.\\" ::* \\"But it was never suspected that these variously named island was the very island \\"Ulneungdo.\\" ::* \\"It is ... said that a Japanese district office carried out such a plan imposing upon the world.\\" ::* \\"Such an island occupied illegally by Japan should be returned to Korea.\\" The document's clear identification of Liancourt Rocks with \\"Docksum\\" in the Korean vernacular language is curiously ignored by William Sebald, whose office relayed a facsimile copy to the US State Department. The document is unique in its logical treatment of Liancourt Rocks as an appendage or dependency to Ulleung Is as can be seen in the statement: \\"these variously named island was the very island 'Ulneungdo'\\" although some scholars believe the prerequisite to unity theory needs a qualification before it can be applied to the case of Liancourt Rocks.Lee Seok-Woo, in \\"The Resolution of the Dispute over the Liancourt Rocks\\", p. 13, quotes the Eritrea-Yemen Arbitration: \\"[T]he unity theory might find a modest and suitable place, for the Mohabbakahs have always been considered as one group, sharing the same legal destiny.\\" =First US bombing incident over Liancourt Rocks= SCAP designated Liancourt Rocks as a bombing range (SCAPIN #1778), and notified the Japanese government on September 16, 1947.

The South Korean government announced 16 civilians were killed by the US military drill, higher estimates run up to twenty times that figure, i.e. 320. One researcher estimates damages somewhere between 30 and 80 fishing boats and civilian deaths between 30 and 100.

The island does not appear ever before to have been claimed by Korea.\\" =South Korea announces state intention to resume administration= On January 18, 1952, South Korea, a non-signatory state to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, announced the Presidential Declaration of Sovereignty over Adjacent Seas (Peace Line, Rhee Line) including Liancourt Rocks within Korean territory along the expiring MacArthur Line (SCAPIN#1033; June 22, 1946 – April 1952) before the Peace Treaty came into force on April 28. On July 18, 1952, South Korea issued a presidential order to seize all illegal foreign vessels engaging in fishing in breach of the Peace Line. =Japanese MOFA acknowledges intention behind bombing range designation= On May 23, 1952, in a Foreign Affairs committee meeting held in the House of Representatives, Ishihara, Vice-minister of Foreigner Affairs acknowledged MOFA's intention regarding the designation of Liancourt Rocks as bombing range for Occupation Forces in response to a question raised by Yamamoto, a Diet member from the Shimane constituency: \\"[To] help Japan get confirmation of its territorial sovereignty over the island.\\" When Yamamoto asked, \\"As for the designation of the military practice area for the Occupation Forces, I think that if the vicinity of Takeshima is designated as a practice area, it would help Japan get confirmation of its territorial sovereignty over the island. Please tell me if that is what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends,\\" Ishihara replied, \\"It seems that things are sought after in various ways, largely from such an idea.\\" = Second US bombing incident over Liancourt Rocks raises doubts = On September 15, 1952, a South Korean scientific expedition aboard Chinnam-ho and a fishing crew of 23 aboard Kwangyong-ho were attacked on Liancourt Rocks waters by a mono-propellered aircraft bearing the US insignia that disappeared in the direction of Japan after dropping four bombs. The Republic of Korea Navy had initially submitted an itinerary to the United Nations Naval Commander in Busan (CTG 95.7) on Sep 7 of the expedition to visit Ulleungdo Island and Liancourt Rocks September 14 and 15. Granted approval to travel to said areas by CTG 95.7, the expedition departed Busan on Sep 12 unaware of the United States-Japan Joint Committee's bombing plan over Liancourt Rocks for Sept 15.

B. Finn, Officer in Charge of Japanese Affairs at the State Department, Washington D.C., whether the U.S. would support Japan in the Security Council if it submitted the dispute with the ROK over Liancourt Rocks. William Sebald responded, \\"I have personally followed this controversy over a long period of time... although Japan is free to do as it thought best in presenting its case, the Security Council would probably want to see that all bilateral efforts have been exhausted before hearing the case.\\" He added, \\"It seems that the ROK will not submit to ICJ arbitration regardless of Security Council action.\\" Sebald added, \\"It is important for Japan to keep its claim alive and not to permit its rights to be prejudiced by default... A note to the ROK or other periodic formal statements would serve this purpose.\\" When Embassy Minister Shigenobu Shima asked whether this constituted US recognition of the validity of Japan´s claim, Sebald responded, \\"US relations with the ROK had recently improved,\\" noting, \\"The US-ROK Mutual Defense Treaty is being brought into force on November 17...The general understanding had been agreed to in Seoul.\\" As of 2011, the United States Department of State would stand on a neutral position on this issue.State Department Daily Press Briefing, August 2, 2011 = South Korea's crackdown on Japanese fishermen and fishing vessels = According to a report by the Japan Coast Guard, from 1947 to the end of 1965, South Korea's crackdown on Japanese fishing vessels resulted in the capture of 327 vessels and 3,911 fishermen. Since then, 142 vessels and 3,903 fishermen were returned, but 182 vessels were not returned and eight fishermen were confirmed dead. 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations In 1965, the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea was signed which recognized the Liancourt Rocks dispute. The conditions in the treaty pertaining to the Liancourt Rocks were as follows:: # Both countries will recognize that the other claims the islets as their own territory, and neither side would object when the other made a counterargument. They agreed to regard it as a problem that would have to be resolved in the future. # If any fishing territories are demarcated in the future, both countries can use the Liancourt Rocks as their own territory to mark the boundaries. Those places where the two lines overlapped would be considered joint territory. # The status quo in which South Korea occupies the islets will be maintained, but the Koreans would not increase their police presence or build new facilities. # Both countries will uphold this agreement. The Joongang Ilbo reported in 2007 that this portion of the treaty was ordered destroyed by Chun Doo-hwan in the 1980s.Joongang Ilbo. 韓日協定締結の５カ月前に「独島密約」あった March 19, 2007.Yomiuri Shinbun.「竹島領有」日韓が主張を黙認し合う密約…韓国誌報道. March 19, 2007. Recent conflict Location of Liancourt Rocks between South Korea and Japan On April 25, 2006, President Roh Moo-hyun of South Korea announced a special dialog about Korea–Japan relations, that demanded Japanese government's actions following the apology of Japan about previous colonization of Korea. In the dialog, he said 'Dokdo is Korean territory, not an ordinary Korean territory, but Korean territory which had been carved with bitter grief. Dokdo is the first Korean territory which was deprived of when Japan colonized Korea. Japan occupied the land for the battles during Russo-Japanese war'. And he expressed that Japanese claim for Dokdo means a pursuit of the right for the occupied land by imperial invasion, hence the claim for a previous colony. He stated that Dokdo was a symbol of the recovery of Korean sovereignty. This address related to a Japanese plan, announced the day before, for a maritime survey around the Liancourt Rocks. Japan argued that as it would be undertaking the survey in its own claimed EEZ, there was no need to obtain South Korea's consent and that announcing its intentions was a simple courtesy. South Korea said it would arrest Japanese Coast Guard survey boats if they began to survey in South Korea's claimed zone. To back up its threat, it dispatched 20 gunboats to the area to conduct high seas seizure drills. In these circumstances, U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, Tom Schieffer stated \\"The Ambassador stated the United States understands that Japan is within its rights under international law. The Koreans are behaving irrationally, and the United States is concerned that they may do something crazy, causing a major problem. Everyone needs to back off, he stressed, to enable the matter to be resolved peacefully.\\" In July 2006, the South Korean government sent a research ship to collect data on currents around the Liancourt Rocks and stated \\"research is just an act based on sovereignty\\". On July 5, the research vessel, followed by a South Korean escort ship, entered the area. On July 14, 2008, South Korea temporarily recalled its ambassador to Japan, after the Japanese government decided to mention the dispute over the islands in the for social study classes in junior high school. 日韩国内问题引爆岛屿纷争 (in Chinese) Phoenix TV Hong Kong 2008年07月16日 The Korean Coast Guard strengthened its early warning system as a preventative measure against any possible attempt by Japanese right-wing groups to land on the islets.

Prime Minister Han Seung-soo expressed strong dissatisfaction for Japan's Education Ministry. The South Korean government is also considering building infrastructure to provide tap water, establishing an oceanic scientific base, dispatching public officials to the area, allowing free public access to the islets, and turning Dokdo into a resort area with hotels. South Korea rejected a Japanese offer for a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the annual ASEAN regional security summit in Singapore. North Korea also rejected Japan's sovereignty over the islands and expressed support for South Korean control of the islands.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/kn.html#Issues Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary expressed concern that military tensions would escalate. In July 2008, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) changed the name of the country to which Liancourt Rocks belong from South Korea to Undesignated Sovereignty and also changed the name from \\"Dokdo\\" to \\"Liancourt Rocks\\". Responding to this change, Gonzalo R. Gallegos, Acting Deputy Spokesman of the U.S. State Department, said on July 28, 2008 that the United States has long maintained a policy stance of neutrality on the islets, and that the latest change does not represent any policy change within the U.S. government.Katz, Katrin. \\"Name Games.\\" Foreign Policy Magazine, November 3, 2010 The classification of the Liancourt Rocks as Undesignated Sovereignty in the BGN database was reversed on July 30 under the order of U.S. President George W.

North Korea's attitude toward the Liancourt Rocks dispute North Korea's legal standpoint on the dispute is largely identical with that of the South Korean government. On October 13, 1998, the Korean Central News Agency summarized the state's views as follows: \\"The islet is part of the Korean territory in view of the principles of discovery, possession, and use, which are internationally recognized irrefutable evidence of legal possession of no-man’s island and in view of a legislative step of a state to possess it.\\" The historical sources cited by North Korean authors were usually the same as the ones which South Korean scholars relied on, and KCNA repeatedly mentioned the discoveries made by ROK researchers.Balázs Szalontai, \\"Instrumental Nationalism? The Dokdo Problem Through the Lens of North Korean Propaganda and Diplomacy,\\" Journal of Northeast Asian History 10, Issue 2 (Winter 2013), pp. 105–162. Laying the main stress on historical arguments, the North Korean authorities were less keen on emphasizing the principle of effective possession (a keystone of the South Korean standpoint), for this would have recognized the Republic of Korea as a legitimate state entity. Since both the ROK and the DPRK have been prone to consider themselves as the sole legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula, the North Korean authorities, though they never consented to Japan's territorial claims, often found it inconvenient to side with Seoul against Tokyo in the dispute. In those periods when North Korea was on better terms with Japan than with the ROK (like 1955–1964, 1970–1977, and 1997–1998), North Korean propaganda essentially ignored the problem of the Liancourt Rocks. However, if Pyongyang felt threatened by Japanese-South Korean rapprochement (as in 1965–1968) or sought to cooperate with Seoul against Tokyo (as in 2000–2001), the North Korean media promptly raised the issue, with the aim of causing friction in Japanese-ROK relations.Balázs Szalontai, \\"Instrumental Nationalism? The Dokdo Problem Through the Lens of North Korean Propaganda and Diplomacy,\\" Journal of Northeast Asian History 10, Issue 2 (Winter 2013), pp. 115–157. In August 2018, following the Japanese decision of describing the Liancourt Rocks as “pertaining to Japan” and “illegally occupied” by Korea in high school textbooks effective 2019, KCNA published a news piece condemning the Japanese claim to the islands, once again using historical arguments to back the Korean standpoint.

Route description US 95A and SR 5C began at the intersection of Charleston Boulevard and Fremont Street (then US 93, US 95, US 466 and SR 5; now SR 582) in Las Vegas.

History It is unclear when State Route 5C and Alternate US 95 were first designated. A 1952 map of downtown Las Vegas (depicting road layouts as of late-1950) shows the highway alignment with the state route number and without the US highway designation.

It is four volumes in length.Kubota (2007:255) It is the tale of two siblings whose mannerisms are those of the opposite sex, and their relationships in the Emperor's court. It has been adapted as a novel, two different manga series, and a Takarazuka Revue play. It was translated into English in 1983. The reception of the tale over time has depended on how the society sees sex and gender issues, with one reading of it being as a ribald erotic comedy, while another reading is as a serious attempt to discuss sex and gender issues through a medieval Buddhist understanding.  Story  The story tells of a Sadaijin (high-ranking courtier) who has two similar-looking children by different mothers, but their mannerisms are those of the opposite sex. The title, \\"Torikaebaya\\", literally means \\"If only I could exchange them!\\", a cry by the father. The Sadaijin plans to have them join religious orders, but the news of the talents of the \\"son\\" spreads to the court. The children go through the coming of age ceremonies for the opposite sex, and the Sadaijin presents his daughter as a man to the court, and his son as a woman. The man disguised as a woman, now known as the rank of Naishi no Kami (head of the ceremonies committee), becomes the sheltered princess's confidante, whereas the woman disguised as a man becomes a Chūnagon (mid-ranking courtier). The siblings are worried that they will be exposed, and so Naishi no Kami is even shyer than most ladies of the court, and the Chūnagon more aloof than is seemly. Despite this, the Chūnagon has platonic affairs with the elder Yoshino princess and the Lady of the Reikeiden. Naishi no Kami is pursued by men — the Crown Prince falls in love with Naishi no Kami based on her reputation and pursues her relentlessly. The Chūnagon's best friend, Saishō Chūjō, attempts to seduce Naishi no Kami for a period of two nights and a day. The daughter marries a woman, Shi no Kimi (Fourth Daughter). Saishō attempts to educate the Chūnagon's wife that couples do more than hold hands and sleep next to each other all night. Naishi no Kami similarly avoids the pursuit of the Crown Prince. Saishō has an affair with Shi no Kimi, and then turns his attention to the Chūnagon, discovering in a grappling match the Chūnagon's true sex. He then begins to court the Chūnagon in the usual manner, and insists that she return to being a woman. The Chūnagon becomes pregnant and hides herself away from the court. Naishi no Kami has sex with the princess, and she becomes pregnant. Naishi no Kami dresses as a man and searches for the Chūnagon, and after the Chūnagon gives birth, the siblings swap places. The tengu who cursed the siblings in their previous lives to not be content with the sex they were born with has since become a Buddhist — Willig's translation mistakenly says that it's the siblings' father who has turned to the path. Because of the tengu's conversion to Buddhism, as the siblings resolve to swap roles and dress in the clothes of their physical sex, they become content. The former Naishi no Kami marries the sheltered princess, the elder Yoshino princess, and \\"remains\\" married to Shi no Kimi. He attains the rank of Sadaijin. The Crown Prince, now Emperor, has sex with the former Chūnagon, and is dismayed to find she is not a virgin, but marries her anyway. Saishō never learns what became of the former Chūnagon, the princess barely notices the change in her female companion, and the siblings live happily ever after and have many children with their new spouses. Main characters A Note on Heian names: The characters do not possess the equivalent of birth names. Instead they are assigned sobriquets from the particular court positions they or their fathers occupy, or from the name of their residence. See also Japanese name. * The Sadaijin (\\"Minister of the Left\\"): Father of Himegimi and Wakagimi, uncle of Shi no Kimi. * Himegimi: Daughter of the Sadaijin, known for most of the story as the Chūnagon; later, she marries the Emperor and becomes Empress. * Wakagimi: Son of the Sadaijin, known for most of the story as the Naishi no Kami (translated as \\"Lady in Waiting\\"); later, he succeeds his father as Sadaijin. * Shi no Kimi / Yon no Kimi (\\"Fourth Daughter\\"): Cousin and wife to the Chūnagon, she is sexually innocent until her affair with Saishō. She bears him two children, and \\"remains\\" married to the new Sadaijin (Wakagimi). Her character is quite different in the earlier version of the Torikaebaya. The Mumyōzōshi berates her character in the later version for not being faithful to her husband. She seems to suspect that her husband is not the same person after the siblings swap. * Saishō Chūjō: Two years older than the Chūnagon, he is the Chūnagon's best friend. His unhappy longing for Naishi no Kami leads him to seek solace in his friend, similar to Genji's relationships with the siblings Utsusemi, who is cold, and her younger brother, Kogimi, whom Genji has a chigo relationship with. * Yoshino Prince: Father of the two half-Chinese Yoshino princesses. He predicts the Chūnagon will go on to \\"great things\\", and urges her not to join religious orders. * Elder Yoshino Princess: The Chūnagon has an affair with her, and she later marries the new Sadaijin. The Yoshino princesses are considered curiosities at court due to their ethnicity. As such, the Chūnagon feels an affinity for them, given her own situation. * Younger Yoshino Princess: Marries Saishō at the close of the story. * Crown Prince/Emperor: His longing for the Chūnagon's \\"sister\\" leads Wakagimi to be presented at court as Naishi no Kami. He pursues Naishi no Kami, and assaults, then marries, the former Chūnagon. * Princess / Crown Princess: A sheltered princess whom Naishi no Kami becomes Lady-in- Waiting to. She conceives a child with Naishi no Kami, and marries the new Sadaijin at the close of the tale. * Lady of the Reikeiden: A lady whom the Chūnagon has an affair with. After the Chūnagon becomes pregnant, she turns to the Lady of the Reikeiden for solace. According to Kawai, her relationship with the Chūnagon parallels Genji's relationship with Hanachirusato (the Lady of the Orange Blossoms), as both characters offer the heroes comfort when they are depressed. Kawai considers the emotions and \\"pathos\\" to be increased in Torikaebaya as the relationship is between two women. Authorship Rohlich believes this scene from The Tale of Genji, where Genji discusses women with his friends, is similar to a scene present in the older version of Torikaebaya. It is unknown whether Torikaebaya Monogatari was written by a man or a woman, but it has been theorised that there were two versions of the tale, the first known as Torikaebaya or Kō Torikaebaya, thought to have been written by a man, and the latter, known as Ima Torikaebaya, written by a woman. Mumyōzōshi, written by a female author between 1200 and 1202,Kubota (2007:341-342) which critiques various Heian tales, says there are two versions of the tale. In her opinion, the Ima Torikaebaya is the far superior of the two works.Ōtsuki (1992:359-361) The earlier version of the tale has \\"disagreeable\\" scenes, including a scene discussing the Chūnagon's menstruation, and a scene where the former Chūnagon gives birth while still partially dressed as a man, which scandalised the author of the Mumyōzōshi. Another scene not present in the later version is a scene where the male characters discuss monogatari on a \\"day of abstinence\\", which is considered similar to scenes from The Tale of Genji, but not as good by the author of the Mumyōzōshi, as it is an imitation. It is thought that the current version of the Torikaebaya is somewhere between the older and newer versions of the tale known by the author of Mumyōzōshi. Meiji scholars thought that the tale was too degenerate to have possibly been written by a woman, but it has been pointed out that other tales \\"with a similar focus on the physical\\" are known to have been written by women. In the case of the earlier version of the tale, this may have been a case of a man imitating the writing conventions of female authors. Rosette F. Willig, who translated it into English, considers the version she used, Ima Torikaebaya, to have been written between 1100–70, and suggested that some elements of the tale may be autobiographical.Willig (1983:4-5) There are over eighty extant manuscripts of Torikaebaya Monogatari. The setting of Torikaebaya is at some \\"indefinite point\\" in the distant past of the Heian era — the Crown Princess's status adds to the \\"air of antiquity\\" in the work, as that particular issue of succession did not present itself from the eighth century to the seventeenth century. The tale takes place in Uji, Kyoto and Yoshino. Uji is a few hours walk to the south of Kyoto, but Yoshino is a full day's journey south of Kyoto. Saisho regularly travels between Kyoto and Uji in the first half of the story, but \\"knows nothing\\" of events in Yoshino. Reception The reception of the tale has been mixed, depending on the society's view of sex and gender. The Mumyozoshi censures only Shi no Kimi, who should have been satisfied with her faithful and attentive (if female) husband. Meiji period critics were particularly repulsed by the tale, calling it part of the decline of the aristocracy, and due to this reputation, it received little study even as recently as 1959. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Morioka Tsuneo, , and Sen'ichi Hisamatsu studied the tale's ethical aspects, attempting to rehabilitate the work from its reputation. More recently LGBT critics have prized the tale for its portrayal of lesbianism, centuries before the Class S genre, although Gregory Pflugfelder does not see the tale as being \\"lesbian\\", as he finds it problematic to apply modern labels to older texts. Torikaebaya has been described as a \\"sensationalist\\", \\"sprightly\\" and entertaining tale, but to Willig and Gatten, it is questionable as to whether the tale is intended as a farce, as during the period such issues were considered very grave and the results of bad karma in a former life. Gatten believes the tale to begin farcically, but says the characters grow out of their initial stereotypes to gain enough \\"psychological depth\\" to solve their difficulties, and the tale becomes a \\"realistic treatment of Heian sexual roles\\". Rohlich says that Torikaebaya is \\"clearly not meant to be comic\\", despite the plot deriving largely from \\"ironic misunderstandings\\" about the switch, \\"all else\\" in the tale, such as the relationships and the pursuits are \\"familiar stock-in-trade\\" from the monogatari genre. The Princeton Companion to Classical Japanese Literature says that Torikaebaya has several \\"delightful comic touches\\", such as the Chūnagon being thoroughly surprised when her wife Shi no Kimi becomes pregnant. Torikaebaya is also detailed in terms of its references to the effects of the weather, and the Chūnagon's morning sickness. Hayao Kawai considers the \\"alchemy\\" of the tale to be the \\"double existence\\" of the siblings, which drives the plot from beginning to end. Rohlich loses interest in the latter half of the tale after the siblings switch back. A Kamakura period tengu statue. At the time Torikaebaya was written, tengu were considered evil and the enemies of Buddhism. The Companion considers Torikaebaya to deal with issues of sex, sexuality and gender \\"more profoundly\\" than William Shakespeare or Ben Jonson. The princess's acceptance of the male Naishi no Kami as a female and a lover has been variously described as either that she is very sheltered, or that sexual relationships were common between court ladies at the time. Although the tale has been regarded as immoral, Gregory Pflugfelder says that ultimately, the tale conforms to traditional roles. The father of the children initially considers their condition to be preordained as \\"retribution\\" for something they did in their past lives, as part of a Buddhist worldview. Pflugfelder says that in the original text, the siblings' condition is not labelled definitively — where Willig adds \\"confusion of sexual identity\\", the original text says merely \\"such a condition\\". The tengu were considered at the time to be evil, and the enemies of Buddhism. Anthony J. Bryant describes the encounters between Saishō and the Chūnagon, and the Emperor and the former Chūnagon as rape. Margaret Childs believes that in love relationships in ancient Japan, showing vulnerability was highly prized and erotic, unlike in modern American society. She believes that for both sexes, nurturing was \\"a fundamental component of love\\". Thus, when a woman expresses distress at a man's overtures, she becomes erotic to him. Childs contrasts the different ways that Naishi no Kami, Shi no Kimi and the female Chūnagon resist the overtures of Saishō. Naishi no Kami, the only successful resistant, resists by remaining cold and \\"impassive\\". Saishō becomes distressed, but Naishi no Kami remains unmoved. Although it is important to the plot that Naishi no Kami should not be discovered as a man, Childs believes that Naishi no Kami's tactic would have been considered plausible by the audience. Shi no Kimi, on the other hand, is initially frightened of Saishō, and so he \\"assaults\\" her, and then afterwards comforts her. He coerces a servant into letting him into Shi no Kimi's quarters. Eventually, as Saishō shows his own vulnerability through their encounters, she becomes attracted to him. Saishō found Chūnagon attractive, both through 'his' own beauty and because Chūnagon reminds Saishō of Shi no Kimi and Naishi no Kami. One evening as they were talking, and Chūnagon was \\"affectionately\\" listening to Saishō's love problems, Saishō embraces Chūnagon, and tells the Chūnagon that he loves 'him', thinking she is a man. The Chūnagon becomes angry with Saisho and tells him off, but Saishō only becomes more fervent in his embrace, and discovers the Chūnagon is a woman. Chūnagon then loses her courage - though she remains cold, she no longer actively resists him. The ending has been called \\"surprisingly dark\\" by The Princeton Companion to Classical Japanese Literature, although it does not expand on this line of thought. Gatten describes the ending as being happy, and The Companion notes that the former Chūnagon achieves great things as Empress, as the Yoshino Prince predicted. The many children of the siblings at the tale's close, noted in the Mumyōzōshi, are seen as a sign that all is as it should be. Some of the Chūnagon's affairs with women have been compared with those in The Tale of Genji, but with different results, as the Chūnagon is a woman. Torikaebaya Monogatari has many allusions to The Tale of Genji and Hamamatsu Chūnagon Monogatari, so much so that Gatten suggests its genre should be considered something like the honkadori in a waka, where an older poem is alluded to in a poem. The character of the daughter is focused on in the story much more so than the character of the son, and her characterisation is considered an argument for a female author of Torikaebaya. Her public persona as the Chūnagon fits into the androgynous beautiful hero type of the monogatari, like Hikaru Genji or Yamato Takeru, rendering it especially ironic when Saishō, smarting after having been refused by Naishi no Kami, wishes his beautiful friend the Chūnagon was a woman. Rohlich describes the Chūnagon as unique amongst monogatari figures, as not even The Lady who Loved Insects is as eccentric as the Chūnagon is. Rohlich considers the Chūnagon to be a modern successful career woman, whose talents are \\"frustrated\\" by her unexpected pregnancy. Even after she returns to living as a woman, she uses her experience as a man to control her emotions, unlike other ladies of the court, who easily give into despair. After the Chūnagon gives birth, she is conflicted between escaping Saishō, and her love for her baby, which Kawai characterises as a conflict between \\"being herself\\" and \\"being a mother\\". She chooses independence. Kawai says that although her desire for independence is \\"normal\\" to a modern Western audience, in Heian Japan it was an \\"extremely difficult\\" decision. After she becomes Empress she meets her child by chance in the court and cannot tell him that she is his mother. She is overcome with emotion, but tells him that she knows his mother and that his mother loves and misses him. The characterisation of the tale has been criticised by Shūichi Katō, who describes the characters' reactions as \\"hackneyed\\", and their characters as \\"not clearly defined\\". Katō describes the story as \\"unreal\\", and decries the \\"scenes of perverted sexuality\\" throughout the story. Iphis prays to the goddess Isis, and is turned into a man. Hayao Kawai says that he is not aware of an equivalent tale to Torikaebaya in Japan or in other languages, but he can draw a parallel between the Chūnagon and a tale from Ovid's Metamorphoses of Iphis and Ianthe. Iphis, (a unisex name) is raised as a boy from her infancy, and when she comes of age, her father arranges a meeting with Ianthe. The two girls fall in love, but Iphis is torn as she believes she cannot marry Ianthe as Iphis is physically female. She prays to Isis and is transformed into a man. Iphis and Ianthe happily wed. Kawai considers Iphis's suffering to be similar to that of the Chūnagon, but that the Chūnagon becomes a true woman without the aid of a miracle. Kawai considers the Sadaijin's dream which reveals the tengu's curse to be a moment of harmony between the \\"exterior reality and the interior reality\\". Kawai says that many different kinds of love relationships are shown in Torikaebaya, between siblings, parent and child, and lovers. He considers it \\"remarkable\\" that jealousy does not figure in these tangled webs of love. Kawai describes the siblings as \\"bisexuals\\" — when the Chūnagon is cuckolded, although she feels sorry for herself, she can also feel \\"compassion\\" for her wife, who is in an unusual marriage. When the Chūnagon is hidden away in Uji by Saishō, Saishō returns to Shi no Kimi, and the Chūnagon briefly feels jealous, but she uses her experience as a man to attain some emotional distance. She resolves to escape Saishō after having her child, and \\"pretends to love him passionately\\". The Emperor, although dismayed that the former Chūnagon (or, as he thinks, Naishi no Kami) is not a virgin, he does not confront her about her previous lover. Kawai says this is another way jealousy is avoided in the tale. Saishō does not understand what happened to the former Chūnagon, and he quizzes his new wife, the younger Yoshino Princess about the matter fruitlessly. To preserve his home’s harmony, he gives up trying to locate the former Chūnagon. To Kawai, this \\"reflects his lack of jealousy\\". For Kawai, a modern audience may disrespect Saishō and the Emperor for not seeking out the truth above all else in these matters, but Kawai thinks that the author believes that jealousy is a \\"dissonance\\" in love, and a slight \\"dissonance\\" is preferable, as it heightens awareness of the \\"beauty\\" of the work. In his view, Saishō and the Emperor putting aside their jealousy prevents the work from having too much \\"dissonance\\". Kawai says that by changing one's point of view, for example, becoming like the opposite sex as the siblings do, \\"useless conflicts\\" can be sidestepped. He regards \\"bisexuality\\" as a counter to \\"violent feelings of jealousy\\", as it enriches a relationship and leaves jealousy no foothold. Kawai regards the author's intent in Torikaebaya as pursuing an aesthetic, rather than writing \\"a sentimental story spiced with erotic scenes\\". Kawai suggests that the author of Torikaebaya sought to improve on the aesthetic of The Tale of Genji by imbuing their characters with \\"the virtues of each sex\\". By showing love scenes between two men or two women, albeit with one partner playing the role of the opposite sex, Kawai believes the author attempted to show that \\"a man is lovelier when his feminine side is revealed\\" and also that \\"a woman becomes more beautiful when she shows her masculine side\\". When the Chūnagon repairs to Uji to have her baby by the suggestion of Saisho, she is overcome by depression. When she reaches Kohata, where she might escape notice, she decides \\"to reveal she is female\\". She takes out her flute, which she had owned since childhood, and begins playing it for the last time. She was very sad, and she played \\"splendidly, the sound was indescribable\\". This scene is an allusion to Genji, where two lovers escape to Uji. In that scene, young men play the flute, as it is a traditionally male instrument. Kawai finds the image of a young man, who is becoming a woman, to be a 'unique moment of transition'. Kawai describes Torikaebaya as being similar to Honoré de Balzac's Séraphîta, about an angelic androgyne who is loved by both a man and a woman, who each believe the androgyne to be the opposite sex to themselves. For Kawai, like in Séraphîta, the \\"union\\" of masculinity and femininity in the siblings is \\"something divine\\", although it is not as clear in Torikaebaya as it is in Séraphîta. Pflugfelder describes the siblings as \\"quasi-divine\\", drawing a parallel with the Dragon King’s daughter from the Lotus Sutra, who by her devotion to Buddhism transforms into a man and begins to teach the Dharma. Kawai notes that the siblings cannot be \\"properly united as they are not lovers or spouses\\". Pflugfelder regards the siblings' switches as an example of gender performativity, he notes that each of the siblings will have to re-learn courtly manners in their birth gender, but that their performances as the opposite gender were \\"convincing\\", and suggests that in Japanese, gender roles are spoken of with modifiers that make gender seem \\"mutable\\" or \\"superficial\\". The heroine of Ariake no Wakare is similar to Himegimi, and like Himegimi, she has romantic relationships with other women. Although it may seem strange that the siblings pass, Nishimura points out the male-role actors in the Takarazuka Revue. He also notes that Heian-era clothing had many layers, which Cavanaugh says in the tale is revealed to both \\"identify gender and mask sex\\". Torikaebaya has been noted as placing great importance on clothes in the narrative compared to other Heian monogatari. When the siblings dress in the garments of their sex, their gender changes to become that of their sex.  Translations and adaptations  Yasunari Kawabata translated the tale into modern Japanese \\"shortly after the conclusion of the Pacific War\\". This and subsequent translations led to the tale being rehabilitated from its Meiji period reputation of immorality by Tsuneo Morioka, Hiromichi Suzuki and Sen'ichi Hisamatsu in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Willig (1983:2) Torikaebaya Monogatari was translated by Rosette F. Willig into English in 1983 as The Changelings. She had previously translated the tale for her doctoral dissertation. Her translation is based on an annotated edition of the tale by Hiromichi Suzuki, published in 1973 by Kasama Shoin as Torikaebaya Monogatari no Kenkyu. The choice of the translated title has been criticised as seeming to imply that the tale is magical, but Horton has referred to the translated title as \\"inspired\\". Willig does not discuss why she chose \\"The Changelings\\" as being the title of the tale. \\"Chūnagon\\" is always referred to as male in the translation, and \\"Naishi no Kami\\" is female, regardless of whether the brother or sister is in the role. Thus, before the siblings switch, Willig's translation refers to the character by their assumed sex, leading to such structures as the Chūnagon feeling confined by \\"his pregnant condition\\". One reviewer has described this as \\"awkward\\", but relates that pronouns were genderless and so they do not consider this to be the original author's fault. At times, the translation has been said to be too colloquial, such as the Emperor crying \\"Oh, god!\\" when he discovers his reticent lady is not a virgin. There are many errors in the bibliography for the translation. The introduction to the story makes many generalisations about Japanese literature, some of which are \\"misleading\\", especially the categorisation of Torikaebaya as a \\"giko monogatari\\" (imitation epic tale). Gatten has described the translation as \\"highly readable\\". Harper describes the prose of the translation as \\"wretched\\". Kelsey was disappointed that the foreword was so short and did not include discussion of androgyny in monogatari, but he suggests this may be due to pressure from the publisher to keep the book short. Despite the mixed reception of the translation, The Changelings has been recognised as an important contribution to the field of Heian monogatari study. Torikaebaya Monogatari was translated by Michael Stein into German in 1994 as Die vertauschten Geschwister (lit. \\"The exchanged siblings\\"), and into French by Renée Garde in 2009 as Si on les échangeait. Le Genji travesti. Saeko Himuro adapted the story as a two-volume novel published by Shueisha under the Cobalt Bunko imprint in 1983. This was adapted as a manga illustrated by Naomi Yamauchi, who worked with Himuro on other series, which was serialised by Hakusensha in Bessatsu Hana to Yume and Hana to Yume c. 1986 and collected in four tankōbon volumes released between 1987 and 88. Toshie Kihara adapted the story into a one-volume manga called () which was published in February 1998. Torikaebaya Ibun was then adapted as a Takarazuka Revue play staged in 1987, starring , , and . It was restaged in February 2010 starring and .. Torikaebaya briefly appears in the \\"Onnagata\\" story in Death in Midsummer and other stories by Yukio Mishima. The characters of Maria-sama ga Miteru by Oyuki Konno perform a bowdlerised version of Torikaebaya in the 19th book of the series, published in 2004. Chihou Saito's latest manga (2012–) is also inspired by the tale.

Variants also exist in the sister languages: Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan. Eteriani is a love story of a Cinderella-like peasant girl Eteri and Prince Abesalom who decides to marry her against the will of his father, a king. Abesalom’s courtier Murman also fells in a passionate love with Eteri and sells his soul to the devil to make the marriage impossible. Through sorcery, he makes Eteri ill and persuades the prince into surrendering the girl to him as Murman possesses the only remedy for her illness. Abesalom does not survive the breakup and dies, prompting Eteri to commit suicide. The two are buried together, but Murman buries himself alive among them. Even after death, he becomes an obstacle for a reunion of the lovers: a hedge grows on his tomb, interfering between a rose and a violet which grow on the tombs of Abesalom and Eteri and lean to each other into an embrace. A purely folklore version of the epos, a tale, was first published in the Georgian press in 1858. A more complete publication by the Georgian folklorist Petre Umikashvili followed in 1875. The romance inspired the Georgian writer Vazha-Pshavela (1861–1915) to write his poem Eteri, and composer Zakaria Paliashvili (1871–1933) to create his classical opera Abesalom and Eteri.

At about above sea level, the valley is surrounded by snow-capped mountains. It has diverse fauna and wildlife including the Himalayan brown bear and the snow leopard. The Kishanganga River flows through the valley. The road to Gilgit runs through Gurez. Gurez is divided into three regions. The area from Toabat to Sharda Peeth is administered by Pakistan as Neelum District, that between Kamri and Minimarg is administered by Pakistan as Astore District, Gilgit- Baltistan, and that from Taobat to Abdullah Tulail is known as Gurez Tehsil, and is part of the Indian-administered Bandipore district. Being situated very close to the Burzil Pass, which leads into Astore District of Gilgit- Baltistan, the inhabitants are ethnic Dards/Shins. They speak the Shina language and have the same styles of dress and culture as their kinsmen in Pakistani- administered Northern areas. Dawar is the central township in the area. The population of the area is estimated to be about 30,000, and is scattered among fifteen villages. Due to heavy snowfall (around ) and closure of Razdan Pass in winter, the valley remains cut off for six months of the year. History Historically, Gurez was part of ancient Dardistan, stretching between Sharada Peeth in the west, Minimarg in the north, Drass in the east, and Baghtor in the south. The valley falls along the ancient Silk Route, which connected the Kashmir Valley with Gilgit, before continuing further to Kashgar. Archaeological surveys in valleys north of Gurez have uncovered hundreds of carved inscriptions in Kharoshthi, Brahmi, and Tibetan. In particular, the carvings provide insights into the origins of the Kashmiri people and the early history of Buddhism. The ancient capital of the Dards, Dawar, is located in the Gurez Valley and is an important archaeological site. Other archaeological sites of importance in the valley include Kanzilwan, where the last council of Buddhism is believed to have been held and, further downstream, the ruins of the ancient Sharda University are preserved along the Kishenganga/Neelum River. Prior to the partition of Kashmir, Gurez had been a popular destination for foreign tourists, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who is known to have visited some time before he became the US president. During the colonial period, Gurez was often visited by trekkers. Nehru and Indira Gandhi, accompanied by Sheikh Abdullah, were among those who visited the area in the 1940s, fishing for trout at Naranag, one of the lakes in the mountains above the valley.  Geography  While describing the Kishenganga Valley (Gurez), Walter R. Lawrence writes in his book The Valley of Kashmir, > \\"Perhaps Pahalgam, the village of the shepherds that stands at the head of > the Liddar valley with its healthy forest of pines, and Gurez, which lies at > a distance of thirty-five miles from Bandipora, the port of the Wular Lake, > will before long rival in popularity the other margs. Gurez is a lovely > valley five miles in length lying at an elevation of about 8000 feet above > the sea. The Kishenganga river flows through it, and on either side tower > mountain scraps of indescribable grandeur. Perhaps one of the most beautiful > scenes in the whole of the Kashmir is the grove of huge poplars through > which the traveller enters the Gurez valley. The climate is dry and mild, > excellent English vegetables can be grown, and the wild raspberries and > currants are delicious.\\"(P: 16) > \\"The valley is extremely picturesque, as the river comes dashing along > through a rich meadow, partly covered with lindens, walnut and willow trees, > while the mountains on either side present nothing but a succession of most > abrupt precipices, and Alpine lodges, covered with fir trees.\\"Sir Charles > Ellison Bates, 1872 AD Habba Khatoon Fareed Kaloo; president Habba Khatoon club presenting a cultural item in Gurez Hajji Abdul Aziz Samoon(middle) at a press conference in Srinagar Gurez's most formidable peak is Habba Khatoon, around which legends abound and at one time, even a film starring Dimple Kapadia was planned. This pyramid shaped peak was named after the Kashmiri poet Habba Khatoon. She was a beautiful and intelligent woman from Saffron village chandhara, and originally known as \\"Zoon\\" (which means Moon in English). She was the daughter of a peasant Abuddi Rather, who married her to an illiterate peasant boy named Habba. Zoon was ill-treated by her mother-in-law and husband, because she spent most of her time in poetry and singing. Dejected by her plight, she changed her name to Habba Khatoon. The emperor of Kashmir, Yousuf Shah Chak, was enthralled by her beauty, intelligence and poetry. He arranged her divorce from Habba and married her. According to the story, Shah Chak was imprisoned by his rival King Akbar, Habba Khatoon used to wander near the peak that now bears her name to look for her lover. After her husband's death, she wandered the banks of river Jhelum in mourning. She died twenty years later by drowning into the jhelum and now her tomb is at Athwajan. Habba Khatoon Drama club was founded in 1976 by the poet Late Hajji Abdul Aziz Samoon (Retired Police Officer; SSP). The club played a pivotal role in safeguarding the cultural ethos and traditions of the Dard-Shin tribe. Hajji Abdul Aziz Samoon(KPS) was also Chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Dard-Shina Development Organization (JKDSDO), a body representing Dard community in the state JKDSDO  Economy  Energy There is no central electricity in Gurez, although, as of 2009, a hydro-electric plant is under construction by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation. It is unclear if any of the generated energy will be available to the valley itself. India had initially planned to construct a 100-metre-high dam on the Kishenganga, which would have flooded the majority of the Gurez Valley and forced nearly all of its residents to relocate. But due to resistance by the Dard Shin and by Pakistan, which is constructing a dam downstream, the dam’s height has been reduced to 37 metres. Set for completion in 2016, the dam will divert water from the Kishenganga towards Wular Lake via a 20 kilometre concrete tunnel, and will generate electricity for the nearby region. Although construction of the dam will temporarily bring work and money into the area, the Dard Shin have expressed concern that around 130 families will still lose their homes, and more than of land in the valley will be submerged. Because of the lack of electricity, there is no significant industrial activity in the valley. The only electricity which is available comes from a few diesel generators which provide power to some parts of the area in summer for an hour at a time. The Indian government’s relocation plans are unclear, and it has not yet committed to providing hydroelectricity to those who will remain in the valley. Fishery Kishenganga River, with a length of , supports world class trout with an average weight of . As of 2006, there were plans to develop the fishery potential of the area, making it a resource for the surrounding region. Fish in the river include: * Brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) * Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) Religion Shrine of Baba Razaaq in the lap of mountain in Dawar Shrine of Baba Darvaish in Fakirpora near Khandyal Gurez has an only Sunni Muslim population. Before the arrival of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, the region was predominantly Hindu. Hamadani visited the Kashmir valley three times, accompanied by about seven hundred preachers, known as \\"Sadaats\\". Of these seven hundred people, seven settled in Gurez and included Baba Abdur Razaq Shah and Baba Dervaish whose shrines are located near the hamlet of Fakirpora. The names of the other saints are unknown, although they also have shrines, located at Chorwan, Bagtore, Dangital Tulail across the Kishan Ganga River, and at Kamri across the border near Dood-Gagi village in Pakistan administered Kashmir. Islam is the largest religion in Gurez, followed by 84% of the people. Hinduism is the second-largest religion with 14.24% adherents. Sikhism and Christianity form 1.1% and 0.3% of the population respectively. Peer Baba Grave of Peer Baba The Peer Baba came from Multan (Pakistan) in 1933 and established himself in a cave at Durmat, north of Kanzalwan. He was about 35 years old, and his religion is unknown. He is said to have fasted for months without taking any food or water. On occasion, he came down to Kanzalwan and asked for food in Farsi with an Urdu accent. He never refused mutton offered by local Muslims. He was hard of hearing, spoke very little and was popularly known as \\"Nanga Baba\\". In Feb 1940, he came down from Durmat to Rajdhan during a heavy snowstorm, and subsequently died. When the Dilawar Malik, one of the big landlords of Kashmir saw Peer Baba dead in a dream at the same spot, who was his devotee sent his men who tried to bring the Baba’s body to Bandipur for burial, they were attacked by large number of honeybees, and he was instead buried close to Rajdhan Pass.

The story is told in flashback format detailing the life of Sam Gifford (Robert Wagner) from his life as a Southern landowner to his war service in the Philippines during World War II. The film stars Robert Wagner, Terry Moore, and Broderick Crawford, was directed by Richard Fleischer and was partly filmed on Kaua'i. The film's score by Hugo Friedhofer,which included elements of the Dies Irae was nominated for an Oscar for Best Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Plot In 1945, on a Pacific island, Sergeant Sam Gifford (Wagner) is demoted to the rank of private after striking an officer. He is transferred to a punishment company, run by the dictatorial (and delusional) Captain Grimes, who insists on being called \\"Waco\\" in order to prevent his own death by Japanese snipers. Through flashback, we learn Gifford's backstory—his civilian status as a wealthy cotton farmer, married to the beautiful daughter of his State Guard commander, who is also a well-to-do plantation owner. After their reserve unit is sent to the Pacific theater, Gifford becomes close buddies with several of his own sharecroppers—people he had never socialized with at home. As a sergeant, Gifford capably leads his platoon, earning himself a medal for valor. Occasionally, however, Gifford outwardly exhibits signs of fear, battle fatigue, and neurosis. These weaknesses intensify when his father-in-law is killed by a sniper. Another officer, a wealthy landowner disdainful of his men both as workers and as soldiers, machine guns Gifford's friends out of cowardice and panic. Gifford attempts to beat him to death with the butt of his rifle. The flashback ends when Waco calls Gifford into company headquarters. Waco orders Gifford to lead a six-man patrol to check a town believed to be the location of a Japanese headquarters. The patrol finds the town abandoned, but the patrol spots a platoon-strength unit of the Japanese Imperial Army, equipped with mortars, heading towards the hills near Waco's headquarters. On returning, as Gifford reports his findings to Waco, a heavy barrage from Japanese mortars commences. Afterwards, Gifford is sent by Waco to outpost duty with a lieutenant nicknamed Little Joe (Brad Dexter). There he forms a friendship with another former sharecropper, Willie Crawford (Buddy Ebsen). After an attack, the outpost loses radio contact with the company and Gifford is sent back to company HQ for fresh batteries. He arrives to find that Waco has been relieved of command when several wounded men informed battalion headquarters of his behavior. Waco, in formal uniform including rank insignia as he prepares to leave, is shot and killed by a Japanese sniper when he demands that his soldiers salute him. Gifford returns to the outpost, which is hit with another attack in which Little Joe is killed. Gifford and Crawford are the sole survivors. With Crawford wounded in the leg, Crawford orders Gifford back to warn the Company of an impending massive Japanese buildup. At first Gifford refuses to leave the injured Crawford behind, but Crawford insists, pointing a pistol at Gifford. Gifford fights his way through Japanese lines but is wounded along the way. Upon reaching the company he finds that most of the Battalion has launched a new offensive. Gifford warns them about the Japanese units massing in the hills. He demands that help be sent to rescue Crawford. Just at that moment a patrol arrives with Crawford on a stretcher. Crawford and Gifford are told because of their wounds they are being shipped home. Gifford tells Crawford that he wants Crawford to live with him and his family at his mansion back home and he can have a job at Gifford's company. Cast * Robert Wagner as Pvt.

Between Heaven and Hell is one of the 1950s depictions of the US Army that did not paint a recruiting poster image and was more in tune with many soldiers' memories, such as From Here to Eternity, Robert Aldrich's Attack or Samuel Fuller's films. Fleischer uses the Cinemascope widescreen format well, notably in views of hills lit up by a firefight. Reception Critical response When the film was first released, The New York Times panned the film, writing, \\"To be just as blunt about it as Twentieth Century-Fox, Between Heaven and Hell, a World War II drama, lands accordingly, with a pretty dull thud. This curiously rambling, unconvincing and often baffling picture, opening yesterday at Loew's State, very sketchily suggests the regeneration of a hard-headed young G. I. on a Japanese island in the Pacific...Except for the sideline skirmishes with the Japanese, and one fine, big beachhead battle staged by director Richard Fleischer, the action focuses on the outpost, where a brutal, slightly demented company commander, Mr. Crawford, reigns supreme. Mr. Wagner not only manages to survive some snarling comrades, most of whom are wiped out, but also the enemy in a series of lagging, disjointed clashes, verbal and physical, that shed little light on anything or anybody.\\"The New York Times, film review, October 12, 1956.

It is an alternative to the rat-race coupler. In contrast to the rat-race, the three-dimensional structure of the magic tee makes it less readily constructed in planar technologies such as microstrip or stripline. The magic comes from the way it prevents signals from propagating between certain ports under specific conditions. This allows it to be used as a duplexer; for instance, it can be used to isolate the transmitter and receiver in a radar system while sharing the antenna. In practical examples, it is used to both isolate circuits and mix signals, for instance in a COHO radar. The magic tee was originally developed in World War II, and first published by W. A. Tyrell of Bell Labs in a 1947 IRE paper.\\"Hybrid circuits for microwaves\\", W. A. Tyrell, Proc. IRE, vol. 35, pp. 1294-1306; November 1947. Robert L. Kyhl and Bob Dicke independently created magic tees around the same time. Structure The magic tee is a combination of E and H plane tees. Arm 3 forms an H-plane tee with arms 1 and 2. Arm 4 forms an E-plane tee with arms 1 and 2. Arms 1 and 2 are sometimes called the side or collinear arms. Port 3 is called the H-plane port, and is also called the Σ port, sum port or the P-port (for \\"parallel\\"). Port 4 is the E-plane port, and is also called the Δ port, difference port, or S-port (for \\"series\\"). There is no one single established convention regarding the numbering of the ports. To function correctly, the magic tee must incorporate an internal matching structure. This structure typically consists of a post inside the H-plane tee and an inductive iris inside the E-plane limb, though many alternative structures have been proposed. Dependence on the matching structure means that the magic tee will only work over a limited frequency band. Operation The name magic tee is derived from the way in which power is divided among the various ports. A signal injected into the H-plane port will be divided equally between ports 1 and 2, and will be in phase. A signal injected into the E-plane port will also be divided equally between ports 1 and 2, but will be 180 degrees out of phase. If signals are fed in through ports 1 and 2, they are added at the H-plane port and subtracted at the E-plane port.\\"Basic Microwave Techniques and Laboratory Manual\\" By M. L. Sisodia, Published by New Age International, 1987 Thus, with the ports numbered as shown, and to within a phase factor, the full scattering matrix for an ideal magic tee is :S = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} (the signs of the elements in the fourth row and fourth column of this matrix may be reversed, depending on the polarity assumed for port 4). Magic If, by means of a suitable internal structure, the E-plane (difference) and H-plane (sum) ports are simultaneously matched, then by symmetry, reciprocity and conservation of energy it may be shown that the two collinear ports are also matched, and are 'magically' isolated from each other. The E-field of the dominant mode in each port is perpendicular to the broad wall of the waveguide. The signals in the E-plane and H-plane ports therefore have orthogonal polarizations, and so (considering the symmetry of the structure) there can be no communication between these two ports. For a signal entering the H-plane port, a well-designed matching structure will prevent any of the power in the signal being reflected back out of the same port. As there can be no communication with the E-plane port, and again considering the symmetry of the structure, then the power in this signal must be divided equally between the two collinear ports. Similarly for the E-plane port, if the matching structure eliminates any reflection from this port, then the power entering it must be divided equally between the two collinear ports. Now by reciprocity, the coupling between any pair of ports is the same in either direction (the scattering matrix is symmetric). So if the H-plane port is matched, then half the power entering either one of the collinear ports will leave by the H-plane port. If the E-plane port is also matched, then half power will leave by the E-plane port. In this circumstance, there is no power 'left over' either to be reflected out of the first collinear port or to be transmitted to the other collinear port. Despite apparently being in direct communication with each other, the two collinear ports are 'magically' isolated. The isolation between the E-plane and H-plane ports is wide-band and is as perfect as is the symmetry of the device. The isolation between the collinear ports is however limited by the performance of the matching structure.

This was symptomatic of a deeper schism at the time, between the 'official' Liberal Party in opposition, led by H.H.

Ditch of Valletta, which was built between 1566 and the 1570s. A ditch in military engineering is an obstacle, designed to slow down or break up an attacking force, while a trench is intended to provide cover to the defenders. In military fortifications the side of a ditch (or gorge) farthest from the enemy and closest to the next line of defence is known as the scarp while the side of a ditch closest to the enemy is known as the counterscarp.  Uses  In early fortifications, ditches were often used in combination with ramparts to slow down the enemy whilst defensive fire could be brought to bear from the relative protection afforded by the rampart and possibly the palisade. In medieval fortification, a ditch was often constructed in front of a defensive wall to hinder mining and escalade activities from an attacker. When filled with water, such a defensive ditch is called a moat. However, moats may also be dry. Later star forts designed by military engineers like Vauban, comprised elaborate networks of ditches and parapets, carefully calculated so that the soil for the raised earthworks was provided, as nearly as possible, entirely by the excavations whilst also maximising defensive firepower. Today ditches are obsolescent as an anti-personnel obstacle, but are still often used as anti-vehicle obstacles (see also berm). A fence concealed in a ditch is called a ha-ha.

Overview  Towards the end of the 18th century, when the Vauban style of fortification went out of fashion due to cost, military engineers began instead to build self-contained outworks, such as the polygonal system, in front of fortresses. These outworks were, as a rule, in the shape of an arc facing the likely enemy approach and designed primarily to defend attacks from that direction. The \\"chord\\" of the arc was only weakly fortified and consequently the most vulnerable side of an outwork or fieldwork – hence its name. The design of an outwork or fieldwork was such that its gorge was still in artillery or rifle range of the fortress or main defensive position and could therefore still be covered by fire.  Outworks with open gorges  Straith describes three commonly used classes of field work: \\"works open at the gorge, works enclosed all round and lines.\\" He lists the following as works open at the gorge: * Redan * Lunette * Redan with flanks * Double Redan * Tenaille-head * Bastion-head Closed works are the redoubt, star fort and bastioned fort. Gorges of 'half-closed works' were usually closed either by a parapet or stockade.  Footnotes   References   Literature  * _ (1878). Text Book of Fortification and Military Engineering, Part 1.

Young and starring Edward James Olmos, Lorraine Bracco, Terry Kinney, Jamey Sheridan, and Jeff Corbett. The plot concerns a baseball scout. Scenes were filmed on the Palouse in the small town of Genesee, Idaho, between Lewiston and Moscow, and nearby Garfield, Washington. Other scenes were shot in northern Idaho at Kellogg. After a disappointing debut in a limited number of theaters in Florida, it went quickly to video. Plot summary Virgil Sweet (Olmos) is a veteran baseball scout for the California Angels. He is in danger of losing his life's work because the Angels' new owner, Gil Lawrence (Kinney), is unhappy with the farm system and threatening to eliminate the team's scouts. Virgil hasn't discovered a great young prospect for quite a while. One day, when the car that he and girlfriend Bobbie (Bracco), who also is employed by the team, are driving breaks down on a rural road, Virgil happens upon a country boy named Sammy Bodeen (Corbett) who has a pitching arm worthy of the major leagues. Greeted back in Anaheim with considerable skepticism, Virgil arranges a tryout for Sammy. The boy is wild at first and Virgil's great find appears to be a big joke. Once he calms down, however, Sammy proves to have everything it takes to make it big. Team management, desperate for a new star, immediately begins to overplay the arrival of Sammy with wildly overblown hype. A public- relations blitz promotes the boy as baseball's next great star, even though he has yet to throw a pitch in a big-league game. By the time Sammy takes the mound for his first Angels game, expectations are so high that he cannot possibly live up to them. He is roughed up by opponents in the first inning, humiliating the owner and making fans furious. But, gradually, with a surprise assist from Virgil on the field, Sammy settles down and begins to look like a star in the making.

Restoration by the late Louis Ferguson managed to reveal and preserve several elements of the original structure such as the hand-hewn beams of its frame and the lime mortar made from local oyster shells, used to cement its stone wall.Reunion for Three Families Spanning Three Centuries, The New York Times 1996 Other features of the house include walls, pine floorboards and a fireplace in the kitchen. Several Lispenard family grave-sites are also located on the property. During the War of 1812, guards of the local militia were stationed in the neck to prevent a landing by the British fleet blockading the Sound. An incident erupted as the result of a relatively innocent encounter between an English landing party in search of fresh food and American sentries. Additional men were moved in and quartered in barns on the neck. The ensuing events, renowned locally as the Battle of Davenport's Neck, involved a false alarm that caused the entire militia to flee the area mistakenly believing they were under attack. In 1814, Newberry Davenport divided the neck between his two sons, Newberry Davenport, Sr. and Lawrence Davenport. Lawrence erected a house on his section in 1816, later known as Davenport Grange and the old Lispenard–Rodman House became the house of Newberry, Jr. This began a process whereby both branches of the family sold large plots of acreage to wealthy persons who established handsome homes and estates on the neck. About this time, Newberry Davenport, Jr. would have added the kitchen wing to the old house, continuing the stone fabric and gable roof of the main house. The grade level of the land around the house may have begun to be heightened at this time as access to the original basement kitchen was closed-off. There is no other evidence of the house changing significantly at this time. Newberry Dayenport, Jr. died in 1863, leaving his house and remaining estate to his two unmarried children, Lawrence Montgomery Davenport and Anna Davenport. Based on the financial successes of their predecessors, the later Davenports enjoyed a comfortable leisurely lifestyle, traveling to Europe, providing community services and participating in the sophisticated social circle that had enveloped around the prominent estates built in the neck. Lawrence M. Davenport had Alexander Jackson Davis design the neighboring San Souci. By 1865, he had sold it to Mrs. Anthony Walton White Evans, who hired Davis to design additions in 1871. The Davenports continued to sell property to the growing number of people searching for country seats on Long Island Sound. Sometime after Newberry Davenport's demise the house was dramatically altered to conform to more of an estate taste with the addition of a gambrel-roofed second floor, porches and interior changes. The roof top ventilator was a functional part introducing the then modern idea of healthful living into the venerable structure. The principal (sound-side) rooms on the interior were embellished with new trim in a restrained manner. Windows were extended to floor level on the piazza and most sash were replaced with casements with an unusually configured muntin pattern. The rear and kitchen rooms remained essentially unaltered in the transformation. The property had been reduced in size to only a few acres as a result of the sale of waterfront lots immediately before the house to Adrian Iselin, a New York financier, and Clarksen N. Potter, former Congressman. The land level may have been further built up at this time and driveways rerouted. When Anna Davenport died in 1913, Adrian Iselin's daughter Georgine acquired the property and lived there occasionally for the next thirty years. Colonial Revival style paneling and trim in the parlor and hall were added during her occupancy. With her residence, the house ceased to evolve and became a local historic relic. Site detail Residence in 2014 The house stands slightly in the western edge of what would have been the highest rise of ground of Davenport Neck, formerly known as Leisler's or Le Compte's Neck. Long Island Sound, roughly 150 yards to the east, was one of its sea views. To the west, the Lispenard mill, built shortly after the house, stood at the end of what is now called Titus Mill Pond and still separates the neck from mainland. Half of this original pond was filled in, for the creation of athletic fields and a causeway across the Mill Pond in the early 1950s. The small promontory on which the house is sited may have been created with earthen fill in the nineteenth century. Lawns, distinguished by mature plantings, extend to the boundaries. Dry laid stone retaining walls create terraces west and south of the house. An early well house remains east of the house near an 1800s kitchen wing that contributes to the significance of the property. In 1968, a 1750s frame barn was moved from a neighboring Rodman family property to a site west of the house and has been adapted for use as a residence. Significance The Lispenard–Rodman–Davenport House is architecturally significant as the physical manifestation of the two-hundred-year evolution of an important regional house form and a residence of three families prominent in the history of New Rochelle. At each of its three major architectural stages, the house embodies distinctive characteristics of its type, period and method of construction. The house evolved from a pioneer stone structure built by a Huguenot close to the end of the seventeenth century to a mid-eighteenth century southern New York Dutch vernacular farmhouse type, and finally to a Victorian period suburban country seat inspired by a romantic Picturesque taste. These stages of development reflect the changing lifestyles and design taste in New Rochelle as it grew from a coastal settlement to a maritime center and residential satellite of New York City and convey a sense of the area's history over two centuries. Additional significance is derived from the association of occupants of the house with the history of Davenport Neck. The Lispenard family was part of the group of Huguenot refugees who established New Rochelle in the late seventeenth century. Antoine Lispenard, the builder of the initial house, was the son of an important emissary of the English colonial government. He erected a dam between Davenport Neck and the mainland and established the first grist mill in New Rochelle. The property was sold to Joseph Rodman, two of whose children had married into the Lispenard family. Rodman further developed the milling business and was a member of the growing Quaker community that was expanding along the Sound and contributing to the industrial and mercantile sophistication of the area. However, the occupants with the longest tenure and most dramatic impact on the property were the Davenports. Within the 129 years of their ownership, the farmhouse was completely transformed into an elegant country seat and the farm was subdivided into independent waterfront estates owned by Davenport descendants and others. The Davenports participated in local commerce and government and were agents in the change experienced in the growing nineteenth century community.

Function  This gene encodes a myosin light chain kinase, a calcium / calmodulin dependent enzyme, that is exclusively expressed in adult skeletal muscle. The MYLK2 gene expresses skMLCK more prevalently in fast twitch muscle fibers as compared to slow twitch muscle fibers. Calmodulin is composed of two terminal domains (N,C) each containing two E-F hand motifs that bind to Ca2+. Upon saturation of Ca2+, Calmodulin undergoes a conformation change allowing it to bind with a target protein such as skMLCK. An image depicting a similar complex (sdCen/skMLCK2) is shown under myosin light chain kinase. This binding to skMLCK increases the affinity of Ca2+ and ultimately leads to a sustained muscle action.

Wilhelm Geiger in his Maldivian Linguistic Studies states: \\"The sound is very difficult to describe and to imitate.

Colombo  Anthropological and historic significance  In the earliest work on Maldivian history written by a Maldivian, (the Kitab fi Athaari Meedoo el-Qadimiyyeh by Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine of Meedhoo) Shaviyani is considered a unique characteristic of the language of the first Maldivian settler still reminiscent in the Dhivehi language today. It is said that these first settlers, the Deyvis, came from Kalbanja (possibly Kalinga) in India several centuries before the Kingdom of Malik Aashooq and settled in Isduva island (Isdhoo) of Isduvammathi (Haddhunmathi Atoll). By the time the late-Aryan settlers came to settle the Maldives in 600 B.C., the original language of the Deyvis had been mixed with that of later settlers the Redins and the Kunibeens to form the Deevis language; but the unique Shaviyani sound had survived. The letter was described as that letter pronounced between the letter \\"r\\" and \\"sh\\". In fact the letter was called rhaviyani until much later.Allama Ahmed Shihabuddine (original work in Arabic, translated to Dhivehi by Dhoondeyri Don Maniku), Kitab fi Athaari Meedoo el-Qadimiyyeh.

In the song, Valentino is driving on the autobahn, in the middle of a long trip, and day-dreaming about the woman in the car ahead of him—he wonders what she is like and what it would be like to know her. Meanwhile, the woman becomes increasingly worried about the man in the car behind her, wondering if he might be a policeman or a stalker. The humor arises from the fact that Valentino's character is in a very good mood, day-dreaming and listening to music, with no thought that he might be doing anything wrong, while the woman finally becomes so angry and upset that she exits the freeway before she wants to in order to get him to stop following her. In the original version, Valentino sings in a gravelly-voiced style similar to that of Tom Waits. The song was only a minor hit when it was released in 1977, but its popularity has increased in the years since then, and it has been covered or parodied by numerous other artists. Die Roten Rosen cover The song was covered by Die Toten Hosen (\\"The Dead Pants\\", a German punk rock group) for the 1987 cover album Never Mind the Hosen, Here's Die Roten Rosen. It was released as a single from the album, sometimes considered a double a-side single with \\"Halbstark\\" (Half-strong; originally by Jankees) under the alias Die Roten Rosen. In their version, although the lyrics are identical to the original, the humorous tone is replaced with an aggressive punk tone, making the man come across as a stalker. The cover of the single is identical to the album cover, so the single may also be titled \\"Never Mind the Hosen, Here's Die Roten Rosen\\", which would rather make this a double a-side single, especially since \\"Halbstark\\" was later released on the best-of album Reich & sexy.

It is owned and operated by Lynne Wynick and David Tuck. Founded in 1968 as Aggregation Gallery, the gallery presented a wide program of over 500 exhibitions over 45 years. In 2012, Wynick/Tuck Gallery restructured to focus on private sales and art services, such as appraisals, and as of 2016, is only open by appointment. The gallery continues to occasionally hold open houses.  Artists  Major artists represented by Wynick/Tuck Gallery during its history include Monica Tap, Lawrence Weiner, Janice Gurney,Dyan Marie, William Kurelek, Doris McCarthy, Gerald Ferguson and Greg Curnoe. As of 2016, Wynick/Tuck Gallery continues to represent Ted Rettig along with the estates of Doris McCarthy and Greg Curnoe. Additionally, the gallery's website lists many works for sale by previously represented artists and more, such as David Bierk, John Hall, Mary Pratt, and Michael Snow. Wynick/Tuck Gallery also lists art available from its Aggregation Gallery collection, including works by George Hawken, Norval Morrisseau, and Joshim Kakegamic.  History   Aggregation Gallery  Wynick/Tuck Gallery started in 1968 as Aggregation Gallery and was originally run by a cooperative of 4 art students and artists. Art student John McDonald and artist, Roman Kowal soon left the business, leaving the gallery in the sole charge of Lynne Wynick and David Tuck. At the time, it was one of only a few galleries exclusively showing contemporary Canadian artists and possibly the first in a downtown warehouse location. The gallery maintained a space at 71 Jarvis Street by also operating a framing business. The gallery supported young artists and maintained an extensive exhibition program, eventually moving into two progressively larger gallery spaces over a 14-year period. Wynick states that she and Tuck initially intended to remain practicing artists while running the gallery, but eventually decided to focus entirely on the gallery. In 1972, Aggregation Gallery moved to 82 Front Street East, a former 4500-square-foot warehouse previously occupied by Fred's Fruits just west of the St. Lawrence Market. As the local St Lawrence neighbourhood revitalized, Tuck supported and worked on a number of committees to stop the destruction of historic buildings, particularly the South St. Lawrence Market building.  80 Spadina  In the early 1980s, David Tuck and Lynne Wynick, along with fellow art dealer Olga Korper, decided to move to the mostly-industrial King and Spadina area which was being abandoned by the garment industry. In October 1982, Tuck and Wynick opened at 80 Spadina Avenue as Wynick/Tuck Gallery with a large show of work by Canadian realist painter John Hall.John, B. M. (1982, Oct 06). Beautifully made, but to what end?The Globe and Mail (1936-Current)Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1240628861 Globe and Mail critic Lisa Bowen lauded the new 6000-square-foot space in an article comparing the new energy of King and Spadina area galleries to the slickness of Yorkville area galleries.Lisa, B. B. (1982, Oct 09). The writing on the gallery wall.The Globe and Mail (1936-Current)Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1238746293 By the end of the 1980s the area, as a whole, had evolved into an arts community, with most industrial buildings converted into offices, galleries and fashion outlets. Starting during the mid-1980s, Wynick/Tuck Gallery participated in a number of high- profile international art fairs, including Art Cologne in 1986 and Art Chicago six times where they received a positive response to the quality of Canadian artists. Along with solo shows for specific artists, Wynick and Tuck organized thematic exhibitions combining works from many artists, including their ongoing \\"Informal Ideas\\" exhibition program. Representing senior and mid- career artists along with establishing young artists created a mix of artistic ideas. Wynick curated a number of highly regarded exhibitions, bringing together artists such as Lawrence Weiner, Gerald Ferguson, Greg Curnoe, and Mandario Merz, which helped open up new ways of presenting artists in a commercial gallery setting.  401 Richmond  In 2001 Wynick/Tuck Gallery moved to the large former industrial building at 401 Richmond Street West, which was being developed by the community minded Margie Zeidler in a similar way to the development of 80 Spadina. Wynick and Tuck renovated a new space at 401 that combined the best of their previous spaces, particularly the combination of a larger space with smaller spaces for more intimate viewing and a ground floor location. At 401 Richmond Wynick/Tuck Gallery continued its exhibition program, of which it maintains an archive on its website. The gallery also provided its space, staff and expertise to the Casey House Art Auction, for 13 consecutive years, and to the University of Toronto's fundraiser for their new public gallery space in Scarborough.  Restructuring  In 2012, Wynick and Tuck announced that they would be closing their large public space to focus on private art sales and appraisals. The gallery continues to operate out of small space in 401 Richmond. It represents a few artists and resells work from many previously represented artists, much of which is listed on the gallery's website.  Art community participation  During the years, both Wynick and Tuck served on various boards. Tuck worked from 1973 to 1996 on the board of Art Dealers Association of Canada when it was involved in the development of critical government policies for the visual arts and artists. He also was a member of the Community Relations Committee at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Wynick served for five years on the Canadian Cultural Property and Review Board, during a time of growth and transition as the Cultural Property Act became widely used. She worked closely with the arts community to insure any changes and decisions were beneficial to the arts community. Wynick also served on the board of the Power Plant Art Gallery from its inception as the Art Gallery at Harbourfront through to the first years in its present location. She helped the gallery remain connected to the community while developing an international profile.

Malouin was admitted to the bar in 1847.Les avocats de la région de Québec (1936) Roy, P-G (french) He was married twice: to Marie- Angélique Suzor in 1852 and then to Alvine Morriset. Malouin was first elected to the House of Commons in an 1877 by-election held after Joseph Édouard Cauchon was named Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. He was elected again in 1878 but was defeated by Joseph-Guillaume Bossé when he ran for reelection in 1882. Malouin was a member of the council of the Quebec bar and served as bâtonnier in 1869 and 1877. He died in Quebec City at the age of 75. His son Arthur Cyrille Albert Malouin also represented Quebec-Centre in the House of Commons and later served in the Supreme Court of Canada.

Lee and concluded with the ceasefire agreement of the Shenandoah on November 6, 1865, bringing the hostilities of the American Civil War to a close.Heidler, pp. 703–06.  Background  Julian Scott, 1873, Surrender of a Confederate Soldier, oil on canvas, , Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C. The fighting of the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War between Lieut. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant’s Army of the Potomac and Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was reported considerably more often in the newspapers than the battles of the Western Theater. Reporting of the Eastern Theater skirmishes largely dominated the newspapers as the Appomattox Campaign developed.Harrell, pp. 384–90. Lee’s army fought a series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that ultimately stretched thin his lines of defense. Lee's extended lines were mostly on small sections of thirty miles of strongholds around Richmond and Petersburg. His troops ultimately became exhausted defending this line because they were too thinned out. Grant then took advantage of the situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox. The Army of Northern Virginia surrendered on April 9 around noon followed by General St. John Richardson Liddell's troops some six hours later. Mosby's Raiders disbanded on April 21; General Joseph E. Johnston and his various armies surrendered on April 26; the Confederate departments of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana surrendered on May 4; and the Confederate District of the Gulf, commanded by Major General Dabney H. Maury, surrendered on May 5.Davis, To Appomattox: Nine April Days, 1865, pp. 307, 309, 312, 318, 322–8, 341–403. Confederate President Jefferson Davis held his last cabinet meeting on May 5 and his government dissolved. He was captured on May 10, along with the Confederate Departments of Florida and South Georgia, commanded by Confederate Major General Samuel Jones. Also on May 10, United States President Andrew Johnson declared the rebellion's armed resistance virtually ended . Thompson's Brigade surrendered on May 11, Confederate forces of North Georgia surrendered on May 12, and Kirby Smith surrendered on May 26 (officially signed June 2). The last battle of the American Civil War was the Battle of Palmito Ranch in Texas on May 12 and 13. The last significant Confederate active force to surrender was the Confederate allied Cherokee Brigadier General Stand Watie and his Indian soldiers on June 23. The last Confederate surrender occurred on November 6, 1865, when the Confederate warship CSS Shenandoah surrendered at Liverpool, England.Schooler, The Last Shot, Introduction President Johnson formally declared the end of the war on August 20, 1866.  Army of Northern Virginia (April 9, 1865)  General Robert E. Lee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia, while Major General John Brown Gordon commanded its Second Corps. Early in the morning of April 9, Gordon attacked, aiming to break through Federal lines at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, but failed, and the Confederate Army was then surrounded. At 8:30 A.M. that morning, Lee requested a meeting with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to discuss surrendering the Army of Northern Virginia. Shortly after twelve o'clock, Grant's reply reached Lee, and in it Grant said he would accept the surrender of the Confederate Army under certain conditions. Lee then rode into the little hamlet of Appomattox Court House, where the Appomattox county court house stood, and waited for Grant's arrival to surrender his army.  General St. John Richardson Liddell's troops (April 9, 1865)  St. John The Confederates lost the city of Spanish Fort in Alabama at the Battle of Spanish Fort, which took place between March 27 and April 8, 1865 in Baldwin County. After losing Spanish Fort, the Confederates went on to lose Fort Blakely to Union forces at the Battle of Fort Blakely, between April 2 and 9, 1865. This was the last battle of the American Civil War involving large numbers of United States Colored Troops.Sutherland, p. 188 The Battle of Fort Blakely happened six hours after Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. In the course of the battle, Brig. Gen. St. John Richardson Liddell was captured and surrendered his men. Out of 4,000 soldiers originally, Liddell lost 3,400 that were captured in this battle. About 250 were killed and only some 200 men escaped. The successful Union assault can be attributed in large part to African-American forces.Sutherland, p. 189.  Columbus, Georgia (April 16, 1865)  Unaware of Lee's surrender on April 9 and the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, General James H. Wilson's Raiders continued their march through Alabama into Georgia. On April 16, the Battle of Columbus, Georgia was fought. This battle – erroneously – has been argued to be the \\"last battle of the Civil War\\" and equally erroneously asserted to be \\"widely regarded\\" as such.Columbus, Georgia 1865: The Last True Battle of the Civil War Columbus fell to Wilson's Raiders about midnight on April 16, and most of its manufacturing capacity was destroyed on the 17th. Confederate Colonel John Stith Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola, was wounded in this battle which resulted in his obsession with pain-killing formulas, ultimately ending in the recipe for his celebrated drink.  Mosby's Raiders (April 21, 1865)  Mosby's Rangers Mosby's Rangers, also known as the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry, were a special force of Confederate military troops who opposed the Union control of the Loudoun Valley area. Under the command of General Robert E. Lee, John S. Mosby had formed the battalion on June 10, 1863, at Rector's Cross Roads near Rectortown, Virginia. Mosby practiced psychological and guerrilla warfare techniques to disrupt the Union stronghold. Mosby's men never formally surrendered and were disbanded on April 21, 1865, almost two weeks after Lee had surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant.Wert, pp. 32–45, 275–89. On the last day of Mosby's striking force, a letter from him was read aloud to his men:Wert, p. 288 With no formal surrender, however, Union Major General Winfield S. Hancock offered a reward of $2,000 for Mosby's capture, later raised to $5,000. On June 17, Mosby surrendered to Major General John Gregg in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Army of Tennessee and the Department of South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (April 26, 1865)  Bennett Place marker The next major stage in the peace-making process concluding the American Civil War was the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston and his armies to Major General William T. Sherman on April 26, 1865, at Bennett Place, in Durham, North Carolina.Katcher, p. 184. Johnston's Army of Tennessee was among nearly one hundred thousand Confederate soldiers who were surrendered from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. The conditions of surrender were in a document called \\"Terms of a Military Convention\\" signed by Sherman, Johnston, and Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant at Raleigh, North Carolina.Bradley, p. 270. The first major stage in the peace-making process was when Lee's surrender occurred at Appomattox on April 9, 1865.Catton, A Stillness at Appomattox, pp. 294–95, 339, 365–66. This, coupled with Lincoln's assassination, induced Johnston to act, believing: \\"With such odds against us, without the means of procuring ammunition or repairing arms, without money or credit to provide food, it was impossible to continue the war except as robbers.\\"Snow, p. 301. On April 17 Sherman and Johnston met at Bennett Place, and the following day an armistice was arranged, when terms were discussed and agreed upon. Grant had authorized only the surrender of Johnston's forces, but Sherman exceeded his orders by providing very generous terms. These included: that the warring states be immediately recognized after their leaders signed loyalty oaths; that property and personal rights be returned to the Confederates; the reestablishment of the federal court system; and that a general amnesty would be given. On April 24 the authorities in Washington rejected Sherman's proposed terms, and two days later Johnston agreed to the same terms Lee had received previously on April 9.Eicher, Longest Night, pp. 834–35. General Johnston surrendered the following commands under his direction on April 26, 1865: the Department of Tennessee and Georgia; the Army of Tennessee; the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida; and the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia.Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 323. In doing so, Johnston surrendered to Sherman around 30,000 men. On April 27 his adjutant announced the terms to the Army of Tennessee in General Orders #18, and on May 2 he issued his farewell address to the Army of Tennessee as General Orders #22.Snow, p. 302. The remaining parts of the Florida \\"Brigade of the West\\" surrendered with the rest of Johnston’s forces on May 4, 1865, at Greensboro, North Carolina.  Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana (May 4, 1865)  Dick Taylor The documentation of the surrender of Lieutenant General Richard Taylor's small force in Alabama was another stage in the process of concluding the American Civil War. The son of former U.S. President Zachary Taylor, Richard Taylor commanded the Confederate troops in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana of about ten thousand troops.Wead, p. 173 On May 4 Taylor's subordinate Col. J.Q. Chenowith surrendered the Department to Union officer Col. John A. Hottenstein.Heidler, pp. 584–86. Mobile, Alabama, had fallen to Union control on April 12, 1865.Beringer, p. 198 Reports reached Taylor of the meeting between Johnston and Sherman about the terms of Johnston's surrender of his armies. Taylor agreed to meet with Major General Edward R. S. Canby for a conference north of Mobile, and they settled on a 48 hour's truce on April 30. Taylor agreed to a surrender after this time elapsed, which he did on May 4 at Citronelle, Alabama. Lieutenant General Nathan Bedford Forrest surrendered on May 9 at Gainesville, Alabama. His troops were included with Taylor's. The terms stated that Taylor could retain control of the railway and river steamers to be able to get his men as near as possible to their homes. Taylor stayed in Meridian, Mississippi, until the last man was sent on his way. He was paroled May 13 and then went to Mobile to join Canby. Canby took him to his home in New Orleans by boat.  Last meeting of the Confederate cabinet (May 5, 1865)  Dabney Maury President Davis met with his Confederate Cabinet for the last time on May 5, 1865, in Washington, Georgia, and officially dissolved the Confederate government. The meeting took place at the Heard house, the Georgia Branch Bank Building, with 14 officials present.  District of the Gulf (May 5, 1865)  The Confederate District of the Gulf was commanded by Major General Dabney H. Maury. On April 12, he retreated with his troops after the two major Confederate forts of Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely were lost to the Union forces. He declared Mobile, Alabama, an open city after these battles. Maury went to Meridian, Mississippi, with his remaining men. Maury wanted to join the remains of the Army of Tennessee in North Carolina. However, hearing of Johnston's surrender to Sherman on April 26 he soon ran out of options. Ultimately Maury surrendered Mobile's about four thousand men to the Union army on May 5 at Citronelle, Alabama.Johnson, p. 411.  Andrew Johnson's May 9 Declaration (May 9, 1865)  Despite the fact that there were still small pockets of resistance in the South, the president declared that the armed resistance was \\"virtually\\" ended and that nations or ships still harboring fugitives would be denied entry into U.S. ports. Persons found aboard such vessels would no longer be given immunity from prosecution of their crimes.https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/10/news/important-proclamations- belligerent-rights-rebels-end-all-nations-warned-against.html  Capture of Jefferson Davis (May 10, 1865)  President Jefferson Davis On May 10, Union cavalrymen, under Major General James H. Wilson, captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis after he fled Richmond, Virginia, following its evacuation in the early part of April 1865. On May 5, 1865, in Washington, Georgia, Davis had held the last meeting of his Cabinet. At that time, the Confederate government was declared dissolved.Korn, pp. 160, 162. The sequence of events that led to Davis' capture began early in May 1865, when the 4th Michigan Cavalry was set up in an encampment of tents at Macon, Georgia. The military unit of several battalions was commanded by Lieut. Col. Ben Pritchard. On May 7, he was given orders to join many other units searching for the Confederate president. Pritchard's troops scouted through the country along the Ocmulgee River, and by the next day the Michiganders had come to Hawkinsville, Georgia, about fifty miles south of Macon, from where they continued along the river to Abbeville, Georgia. There, Pritchard learned from Lieutenant Colonel Henry Harnden that his First Wisconsin Cavalry was hot on Davis's trail. After a meeting between the two colonels, Harnden and his men headed off towards Irwinville, some twenty miles south of their position.Ballard, pp. 97–116. Pritchard received word from local residents that on the night before a party, probably including the Confederate President, had crossed the Ocmulgee River just north of Abbeville. Since there were two roads to Irwindale, one of which had been taken by Harnden and his men, Pritchard decided to take the other, to see if he could capture Davis. He took with him about a hundred and forty men and their horses, while the balance of the Michiganders stayed on the Ocmulgee River near Abbeville. Some seven hours later, at 1 A.M. on May 10, Pritchard arrived at Irwindale. There was no evidence of Harnden's men being there yet. Ben Pritchard Pritchard learned from local residents that about a mile and a half to the north there was a military camp. Not knowing whether this was Davis and his group or the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, he approached cautiously. He soon identified the camp as Davis's. At first dawn, Pritchard charged the camp, which was so surprised and overwhelmed that it offered no resistance and yielded immediately. About ten minutes after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the captured men in the hands of his 21-year-old adjutant. Once he had approached the gunfire, he realized it was the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded. Back at camp, Pritchard's adjutant was almost fooled into letting Davis escape by a ruse. Davis's wife had persuaded the adjutant to let her \\"old mother\\" go to fetch some water. The adjutant allowed this, and walked away from their tent. Mrs. Davis and a person dressed as an old woman then left the tent to go for the water. One of the other ranking officers noticed the \\"old woman\\" was wearing men's riding boots with spurs. Immediately, they were stopped and the woman's overcoat and black head shawl were removed, to reveal Davis himself.Johnson, Pursuit, pp. 197–98. The plan of escape thus failed.Cutting, p. 302. The Confederate president was subsequently held prisoner for two years in Fort Monroe, Virginia.Van Doren, p. 912.  Department of Florida and South Georgia (May 10, 1865)  In 1864, Major General Samuel Jones commanded the Departments of Florida, South Carolina, and South Georgia, with his headquarters in Pensacola, Florida. His primary orders were to guard the coastal areas of these states and to destroy Union gunboats. He also destroyed all the machinery and sawmills that would be beneficial to the Union armies.Heidler, p. 1093. In the early part of 1865, Jones was transferred to Tallahassee, soon after Savannah had fallen to Sherman and the Union forces in December 1864. There, Jones headquartered the District of Florida. On May 10, at Tallahassee, he surrendered about eight thousand troops to Brigadier General Edward M. McCook. In military action east of the Mississippi River, the city of Tallahassee was the only Confederate state capital not captured during the Civil War.  Northern Sub-District of Arkansas (May 11, 1865)  Jeff Thompson Wittsburg, Arkansas (the county seat of Cross County from 1868 through 1886), would witness one of the final acts in the American Civil War. This happened after the collapse of Confederate forces east of the Mississippi. Major General Grenville M. Dodge sent Lieutenant Colonel Charles W. Davis of the 51st Illinois Infantry on April 30, 1865, to Arkansas to seek the surrender of Confederate Brigadier General \\"Jeff\\" Meriwether Thompson, commander of Confederate troops in the northeast portion of Arkansas. Davis, arriving at Chalk Bluff (now non-extant) in Clay County, Arkansas, on the St. Francis River, sent communications to Thompson asking that they have a conference. These two officers met on May 9 to negotiate a surrender.Filbert, pp. 26–49. Thompson requested from Davis two days to work out the details of the surrender with his officers. The Confederates under the command of Thompson agreed to surrender all the troops in the area on May 11, 1865. They picked Wittsburg and Jacksonport, Arkansas, as the sites where Thompson's five thousand military troops would gather to receive their paroles. Ultimately Thompson surrendered about seventy-five hundred men all total that were under his command consisting of 1,964 enlisted men with 193 officers paroled at Wittsburg in May 1865 and 4,854 enlisted men with 443 officers paroled at Jacksonport on June 6, 1865.United States War Department, The War of the Rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies, pp. 735–7.Jerry and Victor Ponder's \\"Confederate Surrender and Parole: Jacksonport and Wittsburg, Arkansas, May and June 1865\\" [Ponder Books, 1995]  North Georgia (May 12, 1865)  Wofford-Judah marker The surrender of between 3000 and 4000 soldiers under Brigadier General William T. Wofford's command took place at Kingston, Georgia, and was received by Brig. Gen. Henry M. Judah on May 12, 1865. There were several letters between the various generals involved in the negotiation of this surrender, including Wofford, Judah, William D. Whipple and Robert S. Granger.Gelbert, p. 37. Colonel Louis Merrill kept the Headquarters Department of the Cumberland in Nashville, Tennessee informed and according to a letter he wrote on May 4, 1865, there were about 10,000 soldiers under Wofford's command, \\"on paper.\\" These consisted of all the Confederate troops in northwestern Georgia, however only about a third could actually be collected as the rest were deserters. From this group there were a number of soldiers that resisted General Wofford's efforts to make them follow his commands. There is a Georgia historical marker in Kingston, Georgia, in Bartow County at the intersection of West Main Street and Church Street to denote where this surrender took place. It further explains that the Confederate soldiers were given rations after their release.  Palmito Ranch (May 13, 1865)  Lew Wallace The last land battle of the Civil War took place near Brownsville, Texas, and it was won by the Confederates. The Confederates held the city of Brownsville in the early part of 1865. In January or February Major General Lew Wallace was sent by the Union government to Texas. On March 11 Wallace had a meeting with the two major Confederate commanders of the region, Brigadier General James Slaughter and Colonel John \\"Rip\\" Ford, under the premise that the official purpose was the \\"rendition of criminals.\\" The real reason was to agree that any fighting in the region would be pointless and negotiate an unofficial indefinite cease fire. Slaughter and Ford, at this point in time, occupied Fort Brown near Brownsville.Hunt, pp. 25–37. In May Colonel Theodore H. Barrett was in temporary command of Union troops at Brazos Santiago Island. He had little military field experience and desired, it is surmised, \\"to establish for himself some notoriety before the war closed.\\" Barrett knew that an attack on Fort Brown was in violation of orders from headquarters, since the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia already surrendered by Lee at Appomattox on April 9 and many other Confederate forces had surrendered or disbanded by then. In spite of these known facts Barrett decided anyway to go ahead with his plans.Hunt, pp. 1–12. On May 12, Barrett instructed Colonel David Branson of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry to attack the Confederate encampment at Brazos Santiago Depot near Fort Brown. Barrett commanded the 62nd United States Colored Infantry and the 2nd Texas Cavalry, and advanced towards Fort Brown with the intention of reoccupying Brownsville with Union forces thinking they would not encounter any problems, assuming all the Confederates surely had heard of Lee's surrender by this time. To their surprise they encountered Confederates that did not know of Lee's surrender. A ferocious battle erupted at Palmito Ranch, about 12 miles outside Brownsville. The battle was lost by Barrett's Union regiments mainly because they were outmaneuvered and overrun. Of the original 300 Union troops that fought at Palmito Ranch, they lost over one third, mostly to capture with a few killed or seriously injured.  Trans-Mississippi Department (May 26, 1865)  Kirby Smith Confederate leaders asked General Kirby Smith to send reinforcements from his Army of the Trans-Mississippi east of the Mississippi River, in the spring of 1864 following the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill. This was not practicable due to the Union naval control of the Mississippi River and the unwillingness of western troops to be transferred east of the river. Smith instead dispatched Major General Sterling Price and his cavalry on an invasion of Missouri that was ultimately not successful. Thereafter the war west of the Mississippi River was principally one of small raids. By May 26 1865, a representative of Smith's negotiated and signed surrender documents with a representative of Major General Edward Canby in Shreveport, Louisiana, then took custody of Smith's force of 43,000 soldiers when they surrendered, by then the only significant Confederate forces left west of the Mississippi River. With this ended all organized Southern military resistance to the Union forces. Smith signed the surrender papers on June 2 on board the U.S.S. Fort Jackson just outside Galveston Harbor.Cotham, pp. 181–83.  Camp Napoleon Council (May 26, 1865)  Stand Watie The Native American tribes of the Indian Territory realized that the Confederacy could no longer fulfill its commitments to them. Therefore, the Camp Napoleon Council was called to draft an agreement to present a united front as they negotiated a return of their loyalty to the United States. Native American tribes further west, many of them also at war with the United States troops, were also invited to take part, and several of them did.Alan C. Downs. \\"\\"Camp Napoleon Council,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed August 23, 2015. At the end of the meeting, on May 26, 1865, the council appointed commissioners (no more than five for each tribe) to attend a conference with the U.S. government at Washington D.C., at which the results of the Camp Napoleon Council would be presented and discussed. However, the U.S. government refused to treat with such a large group representing so many tribes. Furthermore the government regarded the Camp Napoleon meeting as unofficial and unauthorized. President Johnson later called for a meeting at Fort Smith (called the Fort Smith Council), which was held in September, 1865.Perry, Dan W. \\"A Foreordained Commonwealth\\" , Chronicles of Oklahoma 14:1 (March 1936) 22-48 (retrieved February 5, 2017)  Surrender of Cherokee chief Stand Watie (June 23, 1865)  Cherokee Brigadier General Stand Watie commanded the Confederate Indians when he surrendered on June 23.Hoxie, p. 679. This was the last significant Confederate active force.Markowitz, p. 846. Watie formed the Cherokee Mounted Rifles. He was a guerrilla fighter commanding Cherokee, Seminole, Creek, and Osage Indian soldiers.Brigadier General Stand Waite They earned a notorious reputation for their bold and brave fighting. Yearly, Federal troops all over the western United States hunted for Watie, but they never captured him. He surrendered on June 23 at Fort Towson, in the Choctaw Nations area at the village of Doaksville (now a ghost town) of the Indian Territory, being the last Confederate general to surrender in the American Civil War.Morris, pp. 68–69  CSS Shenandoah (November 6, 1865)  CSS Shenandoah James Waddell World route of CSS Shenandoah Editorial cartoon satirizing James Waddell still engaging in combat after the Civil War was regarded over. The CSS Shenandoah was commissioned as a commerce raider by the Confederacy to interfere with Union shipping and hinder their efforts in the American Civil War. A Scottish-built merchant ship originally called the Sea King, it was secretly purchased by Confederate agents in September 1864. Captain James Waddell renamed the ship Shenandoah after she was converted to a warship off the coast of Spain on October 19, shortly after leaving England. William Conway Whittle, Waddell's right-hand man, was the ship's executive officer.Baldwin, pp. 1–11. The Shenandoah, sailing south then east across the Indian Ocean and into the South Pacific, was in Micronesia at the Island of Ponape (called Ascension Island by Whittle) at the time of the surrender of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia to the Union forces on April 9, 1865.Baldwin, pp. 198–205. Waddell had already captured and disposed of thirteen Union merchantmen. The Shenandoah destroyed one more prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians and into the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19.Baldwin, pp. 238–54. Continuing then south along the coast of Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War.Baldwin, p. 255. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters. Waddell finally learned of Lee's surrender on June 27 when the captain of the prize Susan & Abigail produced a newspaper from San Francisco. The same paper contained Confederate President Jefferson Davis's proclamation that the \\"war would be carried on with re-newed vigor\\".LAST CONFEDERATE CRUISER by CORNELIUS E. HUNT one of her officers. 267 Shenandoah proceeded to capture a further ten whalers in the following seven hours. Waddell then steered Shenandoah south, intending to raid the port of San Francisco which he believed to be poorly defended. En route they encountered an English barque, Barracouta, on August 2 from which Waddell learned of the final collapse of the Confederacy including the surrenders of Johnston's, Kirby Smith's, and Magruder's armies and the capture of President Davis. The long log entry of the Shenandoah for August 2, 1865, begins \\"The darkest day of my life.\\" Captain Waddell realized then in his grief that they had taken innocent unarmed Union whaling ships as prizes when the rest of the country had ended hostilities.McKenna, p. 340. Following the orders of the captain of the Barracouta, Waddell immediately converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull.Baldwin, p. 279. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.Baldwin, pp. 275–307. Thus the final Confederate surrender of the war did not occur until November 6, 1865, when Waddell's ship reached Liverpool and was surrendered to Capt. R. N. Paynter, commander of of the British Royal Navy.Sheehan-Dean, p. 130Davis, The Civil War: Strange & Fascinating Facts, p. 213. The Shenandoah was officially surrendered by letter to the British Prime Minister, the Earl Russell.Baldwin, p. 319.Thomsen, p. 279.Whittle, p. 212.Waddell, p. 36. Ultimately, after an investigation by the British Admiralty court, Waddell and his crew were exonerated of doing anything that violated the laws of war and were unconditionally released. Shenandoah herself was sold to Sultan Majid bin Said of Zanzibar in 1866 and renamed El Majidi.http://americancivilwar.com/tcwn/civil_war/Navy_Ships/CSS_Shenandoah.html Several of the crew moved to Argentina to become farmers and eventually returned to the United States.  Presidential proclamation ending the war (August 20, 1866)  On August 20, 1866, United States President Andrew Johnson signed a Proclamation—Declaring that Peace, Order, Tranquillity, and Civil Authority Now Exists in and Throughout the Whole of the United States of America.Text of Johnson's proclamation It cited the end of the insurrection in Texas, and declared  See also  * Origins of the American Civil War * Turning point of the American Civil War * Military forces of the Confederate States  Notes  Sources  References   Bibliography  * Baldwin, John, Last Flag Down: The Epic Journey of the Last Confederate Warship, Crown Publishers, 2007, , Random House, Incorporated, 2007, * Ballard, Michael B., A Long Shadow: Jefferson Davis and the Final Days of the Confederacy, University of Georgia Press, 1997, * Beringer, Richard E.

A waste heat recovery unit (WHRU) is an energy recovery heat exchanger that transfers heat from process outputs at high temperature to another part of the process for some purpose, usually increased efficiency. The WHRU is a tool involved in cogeneration. Waste heat may be extracted from sources such as hot flue gases from a diesel generator, steam from cooling towers, or even waste water from cooling processes such as in steel cooling.  Heat recovery units  Waste heat found in the exhaust gas of various processes or even from the exhaust stream of a conditioning unit can be used to preheat the incoming gas. This is one of the basic methods for recovery of waste heat. Many steel making plants use this process as an economic method to increase the production of the plant with lower fuel demand. There are many different commercial recovery units for the transferring of energy from hot medium space to lower one:Heat Recovery Systems, D.A.Reay, E & F.N.Span, 1979 * Recuperators: This name is given to different types of heat exchanger that the exhaust gases are passed through, consisting of metal tubes that carry the inlet gas and thus preheating the gas before entering the process. The heat wheel is an example which operates on the same principle as a solar air conditioning unit. * Regenerators: This is an industrial unit that reuses the same stream after processing. In this type of heat recovery, the heat is regenerated and reused in the process. * Heat pipe exchanger: Heat pipes are one of the best thermal conductors. They have the ability to transfer heat hundred times more than copper. Heat pipes are mainly known in renewable energy technology as being used in evacuated tube collectors. The heat pipe is mainly used in space, process or air heating, in waste heat from a process is being transferred to the surrounding due to its transfer mechanism. * Thermal Wheel or rotary heat exchanger: consists of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system. * Economizer: In case of process boilers, waste heat in the exhaust gas is passed along a recuperator that carries the inlet fluid for the boiler and thus decreases thermal energy intake of the inlet fluid. * Heat pumps: Using an organic fluid that boils at a low temperature means that energy could be regenerated from waste fluids. * Run around coil: comprises two or more multi- row finned tube coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit. * Particulate Filters (DPF) to capture emission by maintaining higher temperatures adjacent to the converter and tail pipes to reduce the amount of emissions from the exhaust. A waste heat recovery boiler (WHRB) is different from a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) in the sense that the heated medium does not change phase.  Heat to power units  According to a report done by Energetics Incorporated for the DOE in November 2004 titled Technology Roadmap and several others done by the European commission, the majority of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite (equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat) and offsite (cable and transformers losses) losses, that sums to be around 66% loss in electricity value.http://www.nrel.gov/dtet/about.html Waste heat of different degrees could be found in final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the slag in steelmaking plants. Units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called WHRUs or heat to power units: * an Organic Rankine cycle unit uses an organic fluid as the working fluid. The fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature, to form a superheated gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator. * Thermoelectric (Seebeck, Peltier, Thomson effects) units may also be called WHRU, since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce DC Power. * Shape- memory alloys can also be used to recover low temperature waste heat and convert it to mechanical action or electricity. Applications * Traditionally, waste heat of low temperature range (0-120 °C, or typically under 100 °C) has not been used for electricity generation despite efforts by ORC companies, mainly because the Carnot efficiency is rather low (max. 18% for 90 °C heating and 20 °C cooling, minus losses, typically ending up with 5-7% net electricity). * Waste heat of medium (120-650 °C) and high (>650 °C) temperature could be used for the generation of electricity or mechanical work via different capturing processes. * Waste heat recovery system can also be used to fulfill refrigeration requirements of a trailer (for example). The configuration is easy as only a waste heat recovery boiler and absorption cooler is required. Furthermore, only low pressures and temperatures needed to be handled.  Advantages  The recovery process will add to the efficiency of the process and thus decrease the costs of fuel and energy consumption needed for that process.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090401102235.htm Tapping Industrial Waste Heat Could Reduce Fossil Fuel Demands ;Indirect benefits: * Reduced Pollution: Thermal and air pollution will dramatically decrease since less flue gases of high temperature are emitted from the plant since most of the energy is recycled. * Reduced equipment sizes: As Fuel consumption reduces so the control and security equipment for handling the fuel decreases. Also, filtering equipment for the gas is no longer needed in large sizes. * Reduced auxiliary energy consumption: Reduction in equipment sizes means another reduction in the energy fed to those systems like pumps, filters, fans,...etc.http://www.em-ea.org  Disadvantages  * Capital cost to implement a waste heat recovery system may outweigh the benefit gained in heat recovered. It is necessary to put a cost to the heat being offset. * Often waste heat is of low quality (temperature). It can be difficult to efficiently utilize the quantity of low quality heat contained in a waste heat medium. * Heat exchangers tend to be larger to recover significant quantities which increases capital cost. * Maintenance of Equipment: Additional equipment requires additional maintenance cost. * Units add size and mass to overall power unit. Especially a consideration on mobile power units on vehicles. Examples * The Cyclone Waste Heat Engine is designed to generate electricity from recovered waste heat energy using a steam cycle.Cyclone Power Technologies Website * International Wastewater Heat Exchange Systems is another company addressing waste heat recovery systems. Focused on multi-unit residential, publicly shared buildings, industrial applications and district energy systems, their systems use the energy in waste water for domestic hot water production, building space heating and cooling. * Motorsport series Formula One introduced waste heat recovery units in 2014 under the name MGU-H. The MGU-H will be abandoned for the 2021 due to development costs.

Its appearance is that of a typical \\"little brown mushroom\\": small, brown and indistinct. However, it is distinguishable by its microscopic features, particularly its long, smooth spores. As with many other species of Inocybe, I. lacera contains the poisonous chemical muscarine which, if consumed, can lead to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis. Found in Europe and North America, it typically grows in autumn in mixed woods, favouring sandy soil. There are several documented subspecies in addition to the main I. lacera var lacera, including the dwarf form I. lacera var. subsquarrosa and I. lacera var. heterosperma, found in North America. Taxonomy Inocybe lacera was first described by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries, but was placed into the genus Inocybe by Paul Kummer in his 1871 work, Der Führer in die Pilzkunde. As several forms of the species are recognised, the main variety is sometimes known as Inocybe lacera var. lacera. It is commonly known as the Torn Fibrecap, while in German it is known as Gemeiner Wirrkopf and in French as Inocybe déchiré. Description I. lacera gills. In appearance, I. lacera is a typical \\"little brown mushroom\\", but specific features are very variable. It typically features a convex cap measuring across, with a small umbo. The margin of the cap curves inwards, and often splits. In colour, it is snuff- brown, and in consistency, it is fibrillose and scaley. The stipe, or stem, is tall, and thick, brown at the slightly bulbous base, but lighter towards the apex, and, again, fibrillose. The stem lacks a ring. The flesh is white. The adnexed gills are white in younger specimens, soon changing to a clay-buff with white edges. Microscopic features Inocybe lacera has thick-walled, fusiform cystidia, which have apical encrustations. It has a brown spore print, while the subcylindrical spores are smooth, typically measuring 11 to 15 by 4.5 to 6 µm in size. I. lacera is one of a small group of related species with particularly long, cylindrical spores, the others of which can typically be found on sand dunes. The spore shape is more typical of species from the order Boletales. These features make the I. lacera easily recognisable microscopically. The \\"dwarf form\\", I. lacera var. subsquarrosa, has small spores and thin-walled cystidia, while a North American variant, I. lacera var. heterosperma has spores varying from 5.5 to 15.5 µm in length. The species has 4-spored basidia. Similar species Inocybe hystrix is similar in appearance, but noticeably more scaly. It is also far less common. Edibility Inocybe lacera has mild-tasting flesh and a mild, mealy smell. The North American variety I. lacera var. heterosperma has a spermatic smell. However, species of Inocybe should always be avoided when choosing mushrooms for consumption, as many of the members of the genus are dangerously toxic. I. lacera is known to be poisonous, containing quantities of the toxic compound muscarine. Consumption of the mushroom typically leads to salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting), which has given rise to the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due respiratory failure. Distribution and habitat Inocybe lacera can be found throughout autumn on sandy soil, especially with pine, though it is typically found in mixed woods. It grows mycorrhizally with both conifers and hardwoods, and the fruiting bodies can be found alone, in scattered groups, or growing gregariously. It is most commonly found on the edge of pathways through woodland, and another common habitat is on old, moss-covered fire sites. Other habitats include heathland and coastal dunes. It can be found in Europe and North America. In some areas of Montana, it can be found growing in the spring, under Populus tremuloides.

The hamlet is south-west of Cromer, north-northwest of Norwich and north-northeast of London. The hamlet lies south of the town of Sheringham. The nearest railway station is at Sheringham for the Bittern Line which runs between Sheringham, Cromer and Norwich. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. The hamlet is within the parish of Gresham, which had, in the 2001 census, a population of 443. For the purposes of local government, the hamlet falls within the district of North Norfolk. Description The hamlet of North Barningham consists of a few scattered houses and farms, the church of Saint Peter and one remaining wing of a large H-shaped early-17th-century mansion, originally home to the Palgrave family. The hamlet is classed as a lost settlement. The name Barningham derive from the Old English for the Village of Beorn's peopleA Popular Guide to Norfolk Place-names: by James Rye: Published by Larks press, Dereham, Norfolk, 2000 ; with the north part of the name added to differentiate it from others of the same name nearby. It is thought that BeornDictionary of English Place-Names: By A D Mills (Oxford, Oxford University Press) was a Viking warlord who was given the land as a reward for his performance in battle. History North Barningham has an entry in the Domesday Book of 1085 where its population, land ownership and productive resources were extensively detailed.The Domesday Book, England's Heritage, Then and Now, (Editor: Thomas Hinde), Norfolk, page 192, North Barningham, In the great book North Barningham is recorded by the name of Berningeham.

Prominent buildings Saint Peter's Church The church of Saint Peter no longer holds regular services and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.The Popular Guide to Norfolk Churches,1:North- East Norfolk, By D.P. Mortlock & C.V. Roberts, 1981, Pub:Acorn Editions, Page 70 Saint Peter, North Barningham, The church consists of a nave, chancel, north aisle, north porch and a west tower. It stands in the middle of a small churchyard with a hedge all around. The earliest parts of the building date back to 1100. Within the church there is a memorial to the Palgraves who had become the lords of the manor in the 15th century. The Palgraves lived in nearby North Barningham Hall. When Sir Richard Palgrave died without issue in 1732 the association with that branch of the family ended. The Windham family of nearby Felbrigg Hall purchased the hall and estate, demolishing part of the hall soon after. By 1745 there were only two inhabitants of the village left and the church fell into a state of disrepair. By 1886 the church had become out of use and continued to deteriorate until it was restored between 1893 and 1894. The church then saw a period of constant use in the early years of the 20th century but after a steady decline of services and attendance fell back into disuse. In 1969 in accordance with the Church of England pastoral measure, a petition went forward to have the church declared redundant. In 1973 bearers of the Palgrave surname organised a service on St Peter's Day. This was followed up by the formation of the Palgrave Society to carry out maintenance in the church and churchyard and also organise future services. By organising regular working parties and drawing attention to the historical importance of the church and its monuments it became clear that conservation was the only way forward so in October 1976 the church was officially vested in the redundant Churches Fund. The main structure of the church is built from coursed flint with limestone quoins. The chancel and extension to the nave date from the early part of the 13th century.Norfolk 1: Norwich and North- East, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, North Barningham entry page 200. The north aisle was added in the 15th century and is separated from the nave by a four-bay arcade with octagonal shaped piers. The tower and north porch were added in the late 15th century. Within the tower there were once two bells. One was removed in 1669 when it was found to be cracked. The second was removed and transferred to Bawdeswell and installed in the new church there in the 1950s. Inside the church there are several memorials of note, the most impressive being to Sir Austin and Dame Elizabeth Palgrave which is located on the wall of the north aisle. In the sanctuary there is a monument to John Palgrave who died on 29 May 1611 who had been a prominent lawyer and a local magistrate in Norfolk. On the wall of the chancel there is a monument to Margaret Pope the wife of Dr John Pope of Over, Cambridgeshire. She was the daughter of John and Urith Palgrave. At the eastern end of the north aisle brasses set into a stone slab to commemorate Henry Palgrave who died in 1516. The Palgrave Society continues its association with the church by arranging annual services and other events. It has published several monographs relating to the church, the family and the nearby hall. The official Guide to the Church was compiled by Derek Palgrave on behalf of the Churches Conservation Trust. North Barningham Hall North Barningham Hall or Barningham Norwood Hall was once owned by the Palgrave family. Today the hall is a fragment of a large mansion. What remains is one wing of an originally H-shaped house, probably of 1638; this house stood on an even older moated site. Among the various outbuildings in the grounds of the house, there is a 17th-century privy house and possibly some of the earliest foxhound kennels known to exist. The hall was in ruins for many years; it has been restored and is today a private residence.

Built as a mosque during the Ottoman era, it was reconstructed in 1906 as a church. History According to local legend, Ottoman conquerors destroyed the originally existing Bulgarian village and church. Under Sultan Bayezid II's order, a caravanserai for traveling merchants was then built, around which a Turkish hamlet called Uzunca Ova (Uzundzhovo) arose. The well-known Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi visited Uzundzhovo at the end of the 17th century and wrote the following: Ibrahim Tatarlı's research on Ottoman religious buildings and inscriptions indicates that famous Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan designed the mosque. Austrian historian Hammer also confirms this assertion, with documents that show Sinan had issued 30,000 qirsh in 1593 for the construction of a mosque, caravanserai, imaret, and bathhouse in what became known as Uzundzhovo.Hammer- Purgstall, Joseph. Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches. vol 2. Budapest, 1834. page 584. (In German). Bulgarian scholars such as Ivan Bogdanov dispute Sinan's involvement, as Uzundzhovo had been well-established as a religious judge's seat by 1566.Богданов, Иван. Узунджово. [Истор. очерк]. С , НС ОФ, 1965. 79 pp. (In Bulgarian). After the liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Uzundzhovo's Turkish population relocated. The caravanserai and other public buildings were demolished, sparing only the mosque and one of the caravanserai's entrances. The mosque was neglected until the village's Saint John the Baptist Church collapsed. Lacking the funds for a new building, Uzundzhovo's ecclesiastical board decided to convert the mosque into a church. For this purpose the 10th ordinary National Assembly of Bulgaria granted the parish the mosque for use as a church property. Uzundzhovo residents, however, resisted the idea and resolved instead to demolish the mosque and use its building materials for a new church. After a three-year debate, the idea prevailed that the mosque still had to be preserved for posterity and partially reconstructed. In 1906, it was officially consecrated as a church. After the church underwent remodeling over a century later, Metropolitan Nikolay of Plovdiv reconsecrated it on 9 September 2007.

It opened from Roma Termini to Gricignano di Aversa on 19 December 2005. The final from Gricignano to Napoli Centrale opened on 13 December 2009. When the line is completed trains will take 1 hour and 10 minutes between the two cities. The line is part of Corridor 1 of the European Union's Trans-European high-speed rail network, which connects Berlin and Palermo. History Construction of the line began in 1994. Between 2004 and 2005 a series of tests was carried out prior to the line being opened for commercial operations, to obtain approval for the line to be regularly operated at up to . During these tests an ETR 500 train achieved a speed of . These speeds were made possible by the line's 25 kV AC railway electrification system (rather than the traditional Italian use of 3 kV DC), and the new signaling, control and train protection system provided by the European Rail Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ETCS). It was the first railway line in Italy to be electrified at 25 kV AC at 50 Hz and the first in the world to use ETCS Level 2 in normal rail operations. The first of the line was brought into service on 19 December 2005. The new line begins near Roma Prenestina station ( from Roma Termini) and ends at Gricignano di Aversa, where a connecting line leads to the Rome-Naples via Formia line, which is used for the last to reach Napoli Centrale station. The line features three other interconnections that link with the historical Rome-Naples via Cassino line, near Anagni, Cassino and Caserta. On 13 December 2009, work was completed on the last 18 km line of the line between Gricignano and Napoli Centrale. This includes the Napoli Afragola station, which was due to be open in 2009 when the construction contract was first awarded, but tenders had to be called again and construction was put on hold. Construction was delayed on several occasions and did not get fully underway until 2015. It was opened on 6 June 2017, with regular traffic for passengers starting from 11 June 2017. The station is planned to provide interchange at Afragola station with the Circumvesuviana line in 2022, once that line has been reconstructed. The Naples–Salerno high-speed railway (also known as the Linea a Monte del Vesuvio—\\"line up Mount Vesuvius\\") was completed in June 2008 to allow high- speed trains to and from Salerno and the south to bypass Napoli Centrale station. When the Rome–Naples high-speed line is fully open the length of the high-speed section will be about . The connecting line to Gricignano di Aversa is now not used for normal operations. The longest tunnel on the line through the Alban Hills is long. The minimum radius of curves is and the centres of the running lines are apart. The maximum gradient of the line is 21 per thousand.

Team logos and insignia ;Cap logos NewYorkYankees caplogo.svgCurrent cap logo ;Jersey logos ALE-NYY-Logo-Old03.pngJersey logo 1903–1904 ALE-NYY-Logo-Old04.png NewYorkYankees JerseyLogo.svgCurrent jersey logo ;Primary and print logos New York Yankees logo.svgCurrent print insignia Throughout much of their tenure as the Highlanders, the logo was variations of a stylized N and Y, which lay separately on either side of the jersey's breast. In 1905, the two locked for one season, but not in the way used today. It wasn't until 1909 that the team changed to the familiar interlocking NY that would be the team logo long after the team became known as the Yankees, and would continue to be the cap insignia until today. The interlocking NY was originally designed by Tiffany & Co. and struck on a medal of honor presented in 1877 to John McDowell, a New York City police officer shot in the line of duty. The primary logo, created in 1947 by sports artist Henry Alonzo Keller, consists of \\"Yankees\\" against a baseball, written in red script with a red bat forming the vertical line of the K, an Uncle Sam hat hanging from the barrel. The logo was slightly changed over the years, with the current version first appearing in the 1970s. The interlocking NY has varied greatly, and there are currently three major versions in use. The first is the cap insignia, in which the N and Y are of about the same size and unadorned. The second is the logo on the breast of the home jersey. This logo first appeared there in 1912, continued through the 1913 renaming to the New York Yankees, and after disappearing in 1917, returned for good in 1936, although there have been many small but apparent changes through the years. In the jersey logo, the Y is larger, the letters more blocky, and the curves more exaggerated. The third is the print logo which is used extensively in marketing, is painted behind home plate at the Stadium, and appears on the team's batting helmets. Since the start of the 2017 season, this logo was 3-dimensional on the helmets. The N is larger and more curved, and the letters have large serifs at the end. In 1992, the Yankees along with all MLB teams, had an MLB logo on the back of their caps for the first time. The following year, the Yankees became one of the last teams to wear a cap with a green underbrim. They did not switch to a gray underbrim until 1994, when most teams had been wearing a gray underbrim since the late 1980s. In the 1996 World Series, the Yankees, along with the Atlanta Braves, became the first teams to wear their caps with World Series patches sewn on the side. In 1998, the Yankees had the number #39 sewn on the back of their caps, next to the MLB logo, for Darryl Strawberry, because he was suffering from colon cancer at the time. When the MLB season opened in 2001, it was the 100th Anniversary of the American League. The Yankees had an AL 100th Anniversary patch on the side of their caps for the opening day series. When the Yankees celebrated their 100th Anniversary in 2003, they had a patch on the side of their caps, commemorating it as well. The Yankees along with all MLB teams stopped wearing wool caps, beginning in the year 2007. The new caps now have a black underbrim to reduce glare, and a more 3D MLB logo on the back. In 2009, to celebrate the inaugural season at Yankee Stadium, the Yankees had an inaugural season patch on the back of their caps. It is the first time in MLB history that a patch was in the back of a cap instead of just the MLB logo. However, the Yankees players that played in the 2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, in St. Louis had the regular MLB logo on the back of their caps. Starting in the 2010 MLB season, the Yankees MLB logo on the back of the caps and the back collar of the jerseys had gray behind the bat of the MLB logo instead of the usual red, which was present on Yankee caps since 1992. The Yankees use a block letter \\"NEW YORK\\" wordmark on the gray road uniform which has also become emblematic. There is also a print version of the full name, which is of a more fanciful script than the name appears in the team logo. Design and appearance of uniform The team colors are navy blue, gray, and white. The home uniform is white with distinctive pinstripes and a navy interlocking \\"NY\\" at the chest. The away uniform is gray with a navy blue \\"NEW YORK\\" written across the chest. The player number is on the back of the uniform jersey, and is not accompanied by the player name. A navy blue cap with a white interlocking \\"NY\\" logo is worn with both uniforms. Contrary to baseball legend, the Yankees did not start wearing pinstriped uniforms to make Babe Ruth look slimmer in the late 1920s and 1930s. In truth, the Yankees briefly added pinstripes to their uniforms in 1912, then re-added them on a permanent basis soon after Ruppert bought the team in 1915. In 1929, the New York Yankees became the first team to make numbers a permanent part of the uniform. Numbers were handed out based on the order in the lineup. In 1929, Earle Combs wore #1, Mark Koenig #2, Babe Ruth #3, Lou Gehrig #4, Bob Meusel #5, Tony Lazzeri #6, Leo Durocher #7, Johnny Grabowski #8, Benny Bengough #9, and Bill Dickey #10. Up until 2019 the team had never issued #0, and still hasn't issued #00. When other teams began putting names on the backs of jerseys in the 1960s, the Yankees did not follow suit. Many companies have created replica Yankee jerseys and other apparel with the player name above the number on the back for fans to purchase; but the only official Yankee uniforms that have ever had names on the back are special uniforms used during MLB's Players Weekend, an annual event first held on August 25–27, 2017. Apart from the Players Weekend jerseys, the Yankees were the only team in Major League Baseball that did not display the logo of the official uniform supplier on game jerseys or pants supplied to players; that trend would change as Nike took over as MLB uniform supplier in . They are also one of only two teams (the other being the Detroit Tigers) in Major League Baseball to shun the trend of creating a third \\"alternate\\" jersey. The home uniform has been the same (apart from minor changes) since , longer than any current uniform design in Major League Baseball; though patches commemorating milestones or special events may be worn for all or part of a season. In addition, the team will occasionally wear a black armband on the left sleeve, usually in honor of a Yankee great who has died. In some cases, the player's number is displayed instead. The first time was in 1990, when the Yankees wore a #1 patch on their left sleeve in tribute to Billy Martin, who had died in a car crash on December 25, 1989. They did likewise for Mickey Mantle (#7) in 1995, Joe DiMaggio (#5) in 1999, Phil Rizzuto (#10) in 2007, and Yogi Berra (#8) in late 2015. In 1938, the Yankees, the New York Giants, and the Brooklyn Dodgers wore a patch on their left sleeves in honor of the upcoming 1939 World's Fair in New York. In 1939 and again in 1969, the Yankees, like all Major League teams, wore a patch on the left sleeve that marked a baseball centennial; in 1994, they and all other teams wore a patch commemorating the 125th anniversary. In 1952, the Yankees wore a patch celebrating the team's 50th season. In 1973, the left sleeve featured a patch commemorating the 50th anniversary of the original Yankee Stadium, in the final season before the Stadium's two-year renovation. For the 2008 season, the team wore a patch commemorating the 2008 All-Star Game, another commemorating the final season in the original Yankee Stadium, and a black armband to honor Bobby Murcer who died on July 12, 2008, due to complication related to brain cancer. In 2009, the jersey's left sleeve featured a patch commemorating the inaugural season at the current Yankee Stadium. Upon the deaths of owner George Steinbrenner and P.A. announcer Bob Sheppard within days of one another in July of 2010, the Yankees sported two patches from July 16 until the end of the 2010 season: a left breast patch in memory of Steinbrenner; and a left shoulder patch in memory of Sheppard. They added a black armband in memory of Ralph Houk after his death on July 21. In the final homestand of the 2013 season, the team wore a patch honoring the retiring Mariano Rivera; and they did likewise for Derek Jeter in the final month of the 2014 season, leading up to his retirement. Beginning in the 2010 season, the MLB logo on the back collar of their jerseys has had gray behind the bat of the MLB logo instead of the usual red, which had been there since 2000, when all Major League teams started wearing the MLB logo on the back collar. Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig with Yankees road uniform of 1927–1930 without \\"NEW YORK\\" arch Although the Yankees have worn the same road uniform since 1918 (with the exception of 1927 to 1930, when the arched \\"NEW YORK\\" was replaced by the word \\"YANKEES\\"), a radical change was proposed in 1974. Marty Appel, in his book Now Pitching for the Yankees, describes the proposed uniforms: The Yankees did, however, make some minor updates to the road uniforms that season, including adding striping patterns to the sleeves and a white outline to the jersey numbers and the \\"NEW YORK\\" arch. This has remained since and was the only significant change to the road uniform until mid-2016 season when the road batting helmets became painted with a matte finish, rather than the gloss still used for home games. Special uniforms and caps The Yankees have worn throwback uniforms on two special occasions. In 1996, the Yankees wore the uniforms of the New York Black Yankees on a day celebrating Negro league baseball. In 2012, the Yankees wore replicas of their 1912 uniforms, with an alternate interlocking N-Y logo and without numbers, for a game celebrating Fenway Park's centennial. During a July 4, 2008 game against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees wore a special stars-and-stripes cap with an American flag pattern inside the interlocking N-Y. It was \\"thought to be the first time in their history\\" that the Yankees had worn a special edition cap. All other teams in Major League Baseball, including the Red Sox, sported similar designs inside their cap logos. As a Memorial Day promotion, the Yankees donned red caps with stars-and-stripes logos for a May 25, 2009 game against the Texas Rangers. The Yankees also wore these caps for a July 4, 2009 game against the Toronto Blue Jays and for a September 11, 2009 game against the Baltimore Orioles. The latter game is particularly notable, as it was the game in which Derek Jeter earned his 2,722nd base hit, breaking the franchise record held by Lou Gehrig. During the 2010 season, the Yankees wore special off-white caps with a similar stars-and-stripes logo in games played on Memorial Day, Independence Day weekend, and Patriot Day. Proceeds from sales of these caps support Welcome Back Veterans, a non-profit organization \\"targeting veterans' greatest needs, including mental health and job training/placement.\\" All United States-based teams wore similarly-styled caps on these days. (The one Canadian franchise wore a Maple Leaf design, owing to their national emblem.) For Memorial Day, 2013 (May 27) each Major League Baseball club wore caps and jerseys \\"featuring an authentic military digital camouflage design licensed from the United States Marine Corps.\\" The Yankees, playing on the road at Citi Field, wore camouflage caps with a white \\"NY\\", and jerseys with camouflage \\"New York\\" on the front and camouflage numbers on the back. The Yankees uniform for 2017 Players Weekend was part of a league-wide initiative in which all 30 teams used special color pullover jerseys with contrasting sleeves, inspired by uniforms frequently used by youth baseball teams. All teams also wore special caps. Since the weekend coincided with the final days of the 2017 Little League World Series, all jerseys bore a unique logo that drew design cues from the MLB and Little League logos. The Yankees jersey was navy with gray sleeves featuring the \\"YANKEES\\" script used since 1950 (dispensing with pinstripes for the first time in more than a century), and the team used a gray cap with the traditional interlocking \\"NY\\" logo. Also as part of the initiative, all uniforms had names on the back (a first for any official Yankees uniform), and players were encouraged to place nicknames instead of family names on their jerseys—for example, Aaron Judge's uniform that weekend had \\"ALL RISE\\" on the back. Brett Gardner and Tyler Austin became the first Yankees ever to have their last names on the back of their uniforms. For the 2018 Players Weekend, most Yankees used nicknames, but Greg Bird, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brett Gardner, Ben Heller, and Judge used their last names. Personal appearance and dress code Under George Steinbrenner, long hair and facial hair below the lip were prohibited; the practice has been continued under Hal Steinbrenner since control of the Yankees was transferred to him after the 2008 season. Players who do not fit these criteria must shave the excess hair. In the past, visible tattoos were also prohibited and players wore navy arm bands to cover them, although this practice has since been discontinued. Although this is a policy that all baseball teams once had, the Yankees are currently the only team with such a policy (though former Chicago White Sox general manager Ken Williams was known for asking players to cut their hair, the club does not now nor during his time as GM have a policy banning long hair) and have gotten notoriety enforcing it. Many players, most notably Reggie Jackson, Jeff Reardon, Roger Clemens, Kevin Youkilis, Jason Giambi, Gary Sheffield, Johnny Damon, Andrew McCutchen and Randy Johnson either had long hair, significant facial hair, or both before playing for the Yankees, but were clean-cut by the time they had their press conferences unveiling them as members of the Yankees. There have been some defiances of the dress code, however. Most notable incident involved pitcher Goose Gossage, who had a horseshoe mustache in deliberate defiance of George Steinbrenner. Jackson, though he currently sports only a mustache as a \\"special assistant\\" with the organization, did have a full beard during parts of his stay with the Yankees. Don Mattingly, the face of the franchise for the 1980s and the first half the 1990s, was briefly benched in 1991 for letting his hair grow too long and the team did not let him play until it was cut, but was eventually reinserted into the lineup after it became apparent that he was not going to cut it. When he became the manager of Miami Marlins, he also enforced the same rules until 2017. Several players, including Clemens, Giambi, Sheffield, Johnson, Damon, Andrew Miller, David Wells, and Joba Chamberlain, grew significant facial hair after their departures from the organization. Journeyman outfielder Darnell McDonald had long dreadlocks throughout his career and had to cut them when joining the Yankees despite only being on their roster for three days when the Yankees released him. The Yankees are so well known with their dress code that players for other teams have been rumored to be signing for the Yankees if they adopt a clean-cut look before actually signing with them. In December 2012, San Francisco Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum, known for his long locks, cut his hair short. Although his hair was also short during his rookie season with the Giants in 2007, one Twitter commenter joked that he may have been preparing to play for the Yankees in 2014, since he was entering a contract year with the Giants in 2013. Other players have refused to sign with the team due to these restrictions, such as Lincecum's teammate Brian Wilson, who said he would never shave his trademark beard to sign with the Yankees.

History It was opened in 1897 and changed the nature of the village almost overnight from a predominantly agriculturally based community to a mining village, and helped Kingsbury's expansion. Coal extracted from Kingsbury Colliery was used mainly for industry in nearby Birmingham, although the Lurghi Gas Plant at Coleshill was also a major customer. The colliery operated throughout the first half of the 20th century, and in 1904 the village of Piccadilly was built close by to house some of the mine's workers. Following the pit's closure in 1968, some of the land was used for the construction of the Kingsbury Oil Terminal. In 2009 a memorial wall was built in Piccadilly to remember those who worked in both Kingsbury Colliery, and the neighbouring Dexter Colliery. The wall contains the names of all the miners who worked at both mines. The centrepiece of the wall is a miner's lamp that is always lit to commemorate those who have died and those who remember working down the mines.

He is a correspondent academician at the Royal Academy of History and associated professor at the Complutense University of Madrid. He is son to Manuel Alvar, a prominent Spanish philologist.  Teachings and research  Alvar's research has been almost totally concentrated on the Spanish Modern Age; in his first years, the kingdom of Philip II and how Madrid became the permanent headquarters of the Court drew his attention; afterwards, his fields of research have comprised, to name a few, historiography, arbitrismo (judgments proposed to solve problems of the kingdom, mainly regarding the dire situation of the royal treasury; it can be considered one of the first economic literature of the Modern Age) and biographies of relevant people in the Spanish 16th and 17th centuries. Anthony Giddens’ theory of structuration and the Annales School and Fernand Braudel, have been extremely influential in Alvar's thinking, and sociology and economy are present throughout his works. Innovation in History comes mainly as a result of either a new interpretation of old (that is, already used) sources, or bringing to light unknown data and sources. Probably, Alvar's most defining methodological feature has been the permanent quest for new scientific sources, something straightforward even from his very first book (the Accounts and Letters, by Antonio Pérez, Phillip's II secretary),https://books.google.com/books?id=wyWourPR5S8C&pg;=PR12&lpg;=PR12&dq;=Alfredo+Alvar+csic&source;=bl&ots;=a3EFl3eJ1h&sig;=_-McsBx4Vo- M-t3n4S5_p7rtQJw&hl;=en&ei;=7vp2S6X2HIqknQeAzIm7CQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=3&ved;=0CA8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q;=Alfredo%20Alvar%20csic&f;=false but especially in his last biographies (Isabella I of Castile, Miguel de Cervantes) and a research project regarding the minutes of Madrid's town hall meetings in the last decades of the 16th century. Professor Alvar has participated in 18 scientific projects and he has been leading researcher in 14 of them. Beyond his teachings at the Complutense University, he set up the Chair of Spanish Modern History in Quito, Ecuador, where he was invited professor. But if there is one field where Alfredo Alvar is active, that is scientific diffusion. He is or has been actively engaged in different scientific journals, directing some of them and his different courses, lectures and seminars are a constant feature of Madrid's cultural life.  Works  Among his almost twenty books, the most remarkable are: *The birth of a European capital city. Madrid between 1561 and 1606, awarded the Villa de Madrid prize for Essay and Humanities in 1989, when Alvar was just 31. *Caesar Charles: from Ghent to El Escorial. His biography of Charles V, institutional present of BBVA, Best Graphic Work and First Prize for Books in the Graphies 99. *The dossier of the errant courtier, institutional present of Madrid's Mayor in 2006. *Isabella I of Castile. A triumphant queen, a defeated woman. *Cervantes. Genius and freedom; this has been the first biography of the Spanish writer made by a historian. Moreover, Alvar has coordinated and edited complete collections of history books and some remarkable titles for Spanish historiography, such as the forementioned Accounts and Letters, by Antonio Pérez (edited with just 25 years); the edition of the Spanish translation (by Andrés Laguna, physician of kings Charles I and Phillip II) of De Materia Medica by Dioscorides, and the encyclopaedical Topographical Accounts of Phillip II, an extremely interesting effort to know how there were the different villages of the kingdom, but not, as it was previously assumed before Alvar's work, a mere accountability study in order to tax them.

The refractive index of most LED semiconductor materials is quite high, so in almost all cases the light from the LED is coupled into a much lower-index medium. The large index difference makes the reflection quite substantial (per the Fresnel coefficients). The produced light gets partially reflected back into the semiconductor, where it may be absorbed and turned into additional heat; this is usually one of the dominant causes of LED inefficiency. Often more than half of the emitted light is reflected back at the LED-package and package-air interfaces. The reflection is most commonly reduced by using a dome-shaped (half-sphere) package with the diode in the center so that the outgoing light rays strike the surface perpendicularly, at which angle the reflection is minimized. Substrates that are transparent to the emitted wavelength, and backed by a reflective layer, increase the LED efficiency. The refractive index of the package material should also match the index of the semiconductor, to minimize back-reflection. An anti-reflection coating may be added as well. Also, surface roughening of LEDs is one of the key strategies to increased light extraction efficiency. The package may be colored, but this is only for cosmetic reasons or to improve the contrast ratio; the color of the packaging does not substantially affect the color of the light emitted. Other strategies for reducing the impact of the interface reflections include designing the LED to reabsorb and reemit the reflected light (called photon recycling) and manipulating the microscopic structure of the surface to reduce the reflectance, by introducing random roughness, creating programmed moth eye surface patterns. Recently photonic crystals have also been used to minimize back-reflections. In December 2007, scientists at Glasgow University claimed to have found a way to make LEDs more energy efficient, imprinting billions of holes into LEDs using a process known as nanoimprint lithography.

He was a front office executive for several teams. Early life He was a native of St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Washington University prior to Pearl Harbor, but joined the US Army in 1942. He graduated from Washington University in 1946, after having served in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy, where he landed at Salerno. He was wounded after crossing the Rapido River in January, 1944, during what became known as the Battle of Monte Cassino. He was returned to the US and discharged from service 15 June 1944. In his career at Washington University, both before and after World War II, he played varsity football (pre-war,) basketball, and track, and graduated with a degree in Business Administration. He married Virginia Kammerer, another graduate of Washington University and St. Louis native, in 1947. Baseball career In 1947, Bergesch joined the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He was sent to Albany, Georgia to serve as general manager of a local franchise team owned by the Cardinals. For the next decade, he served in similar roles with other St. Louis Cardinal minor league teams, including the Omaha Cardinals, one of two AAA teams in the Cardinals minor league system. While at Omaha, Bergesch signed future Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson, from Creighton UniversityDavid Halberstam October 1964, Ballentine Press pp 102–105. Bergesch was called to the St Louis head office in 1960. In 1961 he joined the joining the Kansas City Athletics, which had recently been purchased by Charles O. Finley, as Assistant General Manager to Frank Lane. In 1962 Bergesch joined the New York Mets prior to their first season, as Assistant General Manager and Director of Minor League Operations; where he was largely responsible for building a farm system for the new team. First Tenure With the Yankees In 1964, Bergesch joined the New York Yankees as Stadium Manager. Prior to the beginning of the season, the Yankees' Traveling Secretary Bruce Henry was stricken with a serious illness; as a result, Bergesch was given the additional responsibilities until Henry's return late in the season. He remained with the Yankees during the CBS era through 1968. Professional Soccer He became President of the New York Generals, the New York franchise of the first professional soccer league in the US, in 1968. The soccer league played for two seasons, then was disbanded in favor of the North American Soccer League (NASL). Bergesch at this point moved to the New York Cosmos soccer team where his greatest accomplishment was to be the successful signing of Brazilian soccer legend Pelé out of semi-retirement to play in America for the New York Cosmos. Second Tenure With the Yankees Bergesch rejoined the Yankees in 1977 as Director of Scouting. He was promoted to Vice President of Baseball Operations – and served in actuality as General Manager in 1983, although he retain the previous title. Cincinnati Reds He left the Yankees in 1984, moving to Cincinnati as Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Cincinnati Reds. In 1984 the Reds finished 5th in the NL west, but finished 2nd in 1985, 1986, and 1987. During his tenure, Pete Rose was the field Manager, but was also a listed as a player on the Reds roster through the 1986 season, when he set the all-time MLB record for base hits. Bergesch attempted to build the team around a core of highly regarded young players, in addition to veterans like Dave Parker and Terry Francona. However, he was unable to capitalize on an excess of young and highly touted position players including Kurt Stillwell, Tracy Jones, and Kal Daniels by trading them for pitching. Despite the emergence of Tom Browning as Rookie of the Year in 1985, winning 20 games, the rotation was devastated by the early demise of Mario Soto's career to arm injury. Bergesch was fired just prior to Spring training in 1988. Final Tenure With the Yankees Bergesch rejoined the Yankees in 1991, first on a consulting basis, and then more formally, although his responsibilities were only loosely defined. Bill Madden in his book \\"Steinbrenner\\" depicts Bergesch as having a backroom advisory presence during this period, which set the stage for the Yankees' periods of dominance later in the decade. Bergesch formally retired in early 1997. Later life While his health permitted, he enjoyed attending Spring training and regular season games. After the death of his wife Virginia, he moved to Stamford, Connecticut in 2006. Bergesch died on May 10, 2011, a month before his 90th birthday.

After the general election of 1830 Beaumont was returned again for Northumberland, until in 1832, the constituency was split into a north and south division. Beaumont was elected for the latter, and sat then for South Northumberland until his retirement from politic in 1837. Initially a Tory, he was considered a Liberal from 1820.

Examples: * \\"Colourful funeral for colourful racing identity Jack Sparrow\\" * \\"Horse racing identity charged with importing 50kg of cocaine\\" The term gained wide currency in the Australian media in the late 20th century due to a combination of legal and constitutional factors, including: * the punitive nature of Australian state defamation laws which, like their English models, tend to be heavily biased towards the plaintiff * the absence of explicit Freedom Of Speech provisions in the Australian Constitution and * the lack in Australian law of any legal provision or precedent which makes truth an absolute defence in defamation cases. The association between organised crime and racing (especially horse racing) in Australia developed largely because of the conservative nature of Australian law and government in regard to gambling. In the decades before the recent liberalisation of the laws governing poker machines, casinos and other forms of gambling, betting on horse and greyhound racing was the only legal outlet for gambling in Australia (other than government-run lotteries). As a result, horse racing (and to a lesser extent dog racing) provided one of the few legitimate means by which those involved in organised crime could easily launder money earned from their illegal enterprises. Because betting with on-track bookmakers could not be easily scrutinised by law enforcement or taxation authorities, it was relatively easy for such people to claim that any large sums of money they might possess had been won on a lucky bet, and it was extremely difficult for the authorities to prove otherwise. Former New South Wales Premier Robert Askin is widely reputed to have been at the centre of an extensive network of organised crime and official corruption, and allegedly received tens of thousands of dollars each month in bribes from major Sydney underworld figures. Although official inquiries uncovered assets far in excess of what he could have reasonably earned through investments and stock trading, Askin always claimed that his wealth was because he was a shrewd gambler. Likewise, because on-track betting transactions could not be monitored as they could in the government-run betting agencies (e.g. the Totalisator Agency Board), major racecourses became favoured meeting places for many of the people who are now generally accepted to have been leading figures in Australian organised crime, such as George Freeman, Perc Galea and Lenny McPherson.

It is based on the Shakespeare play of the same name.Jiri Trnka · Puppet Animation Master (documentary, 1967)-Internet Archivefilmlinc.org Production Trnka, working under the Czech communist regime who had previously been denied in his wish to adapt Don Quixote, worked for several years on his adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The film established a new pinnacle of craftmanship: Cerise Howard, discussing the film in a retrospective on Trnka for Senses of Cinema, describes the puppet animation as \\"more liquid, more balletic than ever\\"; the scenes between Nick Bottom and Titania are \\"achingly tender\\"; Titania's train is \\"an especially astonishing, luminous creation … constituted of tens of fairies, individually animated amidst reams of gorgeous, extensive coral garlanding\\". Overall the film is \\"distinguished by exquisite design throughout\\". Beyond the artistic aspects the film was technically advanced. Trnka used expensive Eastmancolor stock, which was \\"exceedingly rare for Czech productions of the period\\". Every scene was shot with two cameras simultaneously—one shooting Academy ratio, and one shooting in the then new CinemaScope format, effectively producing an in- camera Pan-and-scan version—all so Trnka could ensure that his widescreen production would not be presented letterboxed. The film thus exists in two definitive editions. The score was provided by Václav Trojan. Reception The film received a lukewarm initial response, but was entered into the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where it tied for the (the selection of the Technical Committee) alongside Vojtěch Jasný's Desire (). It also won an Honourable Medal at the 20th Venice International Film Festival in 1959; first prize for best film in Bucharest in 1960; second prize in Montevideo in 1960; and first prize—the \\"Golden Mercury\\"—for music in Valencia in 1962.

Sudden failures, however rare, can occur as well. Early red LEDs were notable for their short lifetime. Packaging-related *Epoxy degradation: Some materials of the plastic package tend to yellow when subjected to heat, causing partial absorption (and therefore loss of efficiency) of the affected wavelengths. * Thermal stress: Sudden failures are most often caused by thermal stresses. When the epoxy resin package reaches its glass transition temperature, it starts rapidly expanding, causing mechanical stresses on the semiconductor and the bonded contact, weakening it or even tearing it off. Conversely, very low temperatures can cause cracking of the packaging. * Differentiated phosphor degeneration: The different phosphors used in white LEDs tend to degrade with heat and age, but at different rates causing changes in the produced light color, for example, purple and pink LEDs often use an organic phosphor formulation which may degrade after just a few hours of operation causing a major shift in output color. Semiconductor and metal related *Nucleation and growth of dislocations: This is a known mechanism for degradation of the active region, where the radiative recombination occurs. It requires a presence of an existing defect in the crystal and is accelerated by heat, high current density, and emitted light. Gallium arsenide and aluminium gallium arsenide are more susceptible to this mechanism than gallium arsenide phosphide and indium phosphide. Due to different properties of the active regions, gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride are virtually insensitive to this kind of defect. *Electromigration: This is caused by high current density and can move atoms out of the active regions, leading to emergence of dislocations and point defects, acting as nonradiative recombination centers and producing heat instead of light. *Ionizing radiation: It can lead to the creation of defects, which leads to issues with radiation hardening of circuits containing LEDs (e.g., in optoisolators) * Metal diffusion: Caused by high electrical currents or voltages at elevated temperatures, metal diffusion can move metal atoms from the electrodes into the active region. Some materials, notably indium tin oxide and silver, are subject to electromigration which causes leakage current and non-radiative recombination along the chip edges. In some cases, especially with GaN/InGaN diodes, a barrier metal layer is used to hinder the electromigration effects. *Short circuits: Mechanical stresses, high currents, and a corrosive environment can lead to formation of whiskers, causing short circuits. Stress-related *Thermal runaway: Non-homogeneities in the substrate, causing localized loss of thermal conductivity, can cause thermal runaway where heat causes damage which causes more heat etc. Most common ones are voids caused by incomplete soldering, or by electromigration effects and Kirkendall voiding. *Current crowding: A non-homogenous distribution of the current density over the junction can lead to the formation of current filaments. This may lead to creation of localized hot spots, which poses risk of thermal runaway. *Electrostatic discharge: An ESD may cause immediate failure of the semiconductor junction, a permanent shift of its parameters, or latent damage causing increased rate of degradation. LEDs and lasers grown on sapphire substrate (see silicon on sapphire) are more susceptible to ESD damage. *Reverse bias: Although the LED is based on a diode junction and is nominally a rectifier, the reverse-breakdown mode for some types can occur at very low voltages and essentially any excess reverse bias can cause immediate degradation, and may lead to vastly accelerated failure. 5 V is a typical maximum reverse bias voltage specification for ordinary LEDs; some special types may have lower limits. *Catastrophic optical damage: Can occur in high power semiconductor lasers.

He played college football at Henderson State University. Early years Thomas graduated from Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, Arkansas, after playing three seasons of football. Back then because of his small size, he played different positions (fullback, tight end, linebacker, defensive end, punter and quarterback). He attended college at Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, where he became the starting middle linebacker. He closed out his collegiate career as the school's all-time leading tackler with 388 tackles. Among his marks, he recorded 18 tackles in a single game and 129 tackles in a season. He was named the Gulf South Conference Defensive Player of Year in 1995 and earned All-GSC honors in 1995 and 1996. In 1996, Thomas participated in the NCAA Division II All-Star game and the Snow Bowl (later known as the Cactus Bowl). He also was a finalist for the Harlon Hill Trophy. In 2004, he was inducted into the Henderson State University Hall of Honor. In 2006, he was inducted into the Jacksonville High School Hall of Fame. Professional career Calgary Stampeders (CFL) In 1998, he signed as a free agent with the Calgary Stampeders of the CFL, but only played in one pre- season game before being waived. Dallas Cowboys Thomas was not selected in the 1998 NFL Draft and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys. He made the Cowboys' final roster and spent his time playing mostly on special teams. In 1999, he was allocated to NFL Europe's Rhein Fire and upon his return he was switched from linebacker to fullback, becoming a starter that same season, after Daryl Johnston suffered a career-ending neck injury. As a starter, he became a productive player, earning a new three-year contract in 2001. During that season, he would miss the final 11 games after suffering torn ligaments in his left ankle and being placed on the injured reserve list. On February 19, 2003, Thomas was released because of salary cap considerations. During his time with the Cowboys, he served primarily as Emmitt Smith's lead blocker for four of his five seasons, eventually paving the way as Smith ran for 109 yards on 24 carries, while becoming the NFL's all-time leading rusher versus the Seattle Seahawks on October 27, 2002. Arena Football League From 2004 to 2008, he played in the Arena Football League where he broke the Georgia Force’s rushing yds record with 250 yds in a season, and tied their rushing touchdown record with 12. In 2004, his first year with the league, he was named to the All-Rookie team. From 2007 to 2008, he played for the Colorado Crush, where he tied the team's rushing touchdown record (9) and was named to the All-Ironman Team.

The bridge was built by William Edwards and was completed in 1756. The bridge now has statutory protection as a scheduled ancient monument and is grade I listed. Pontypridd In the early 18th century Pontypridd, then known as Pont-y-tŷ-pridd (The bridge of the earthen house), was a tiny hamlet. Pont-y-tŷ-pridd took its name from the original bridge of the same name, however very little is known of that ancient ford with stepping stones, which ran alongside the current Old Bridge, and was used only when the river ran low. Possibly in 1744 or after the bridge was built, Pont-y-tŷ-pridd became known as Newbridge or New Bridge after the William Edwards Bridge. By 1856, Newbridge had been renamed Pontypridd. In 1746 when William Edwards was just 27 years of age, he was commissioned by the Hundreds of Miskin and Caerphilly to build a three-arch bridge across the River Taff. For this he was paid GB£500, on condition that he would maintain it for seven years. Construction The first bridge The first bridge to be constructed was a three-arch stone bridge, which was built in 1746. It was destroyed by a heavy storm which caused the River Taff to flood about two years later. A large amount of debris came down the river, which then become trapped against the two abutments supporting the bridge. The weight and force of the debris ultimately destroyed the bridge, which was then swept away down the river. The second bridge After the destruction of the first bridge over the fast-flowing River Taff, Edwards designed a more radical single-arch bridge that would eliminate the possibility of debris destroying the bridge due to the flooding of the River Taff. The second bridge was built from 1748, however two reports differ as to what actually happened during this second attempt. Thomas Morgan, a contemporary of Edwards, said that \\"…when he (Edwards) had almost finished the arch, the centre timber work gave way and all fell to the bottom.\\" However, The National Library of Wales has a contemporary work known as the Plasybrain manuscript which says, \\"Just after the first single arch was finished and before the centre was struck, a flood came and carried all away.\\" It is not clear which account is accurate, although it is clear that the attempt failed. The third bridge The single-arch bridge was rebuilt and was completed. It stood for about six weeks before it failed again. The weight of the materials in the bridge was not balanced on either side of the keystone, which gradually forced the stone out of position as traffic on the bridge created small vibrations and movement, and the bridge collapsed. In the Theory of Arches and Pontypridd, it states that \\"the weight of the bridge was either too great on the haunches or too little on the crown.\\" At this stage Edwards was either encouraged or forced to try again with extra money being provided to cover his losses for the earlier attempts. The fourth bridge The Old Bridge, when it was known as Newbridge The final design of the bridge included three cylindrical voids (holes) of , and on each side on the bridge. This reduced the weight and pressure on the crown and the bridge is still in operation today, although it is now only used for foot traffic. The Theory of Arches and Pontypridd states that as a bridge for commerce, it was a failure, as it was \\"only eleven feet wide between the parapets and so steep that wagons had to use a 'chain and drag' to descend from the crown.\\" The bridge in January 2016, with the Victoria Bridge in the background The 140 ft Old Bridge surpassed the Old Walton Bridge as the longest single-span bridge in Great Britain and remained the longest bridge for another 40 years.Skempton pp. 217–218 It was also one of the few bridges in Europe at the time, and indeed worldwide, whose span exceeded the 40 m mark. The whole project (including the three failed attempts) cost Edwards a total of £1,153 18s. 2d. (approximately £1,153.91), and consequently his loss exceeded £600. It was reported that Edwards' attempts to build the bridge over the River Taff left him in considerable debt; Thomas Morgan reported that \\"…the mason was considerably in debt and greatly discouraged. But the Lords Talbot and Windsor, who have estates in the neighbourhood, pitied his case, and being willing to encourage such an enterprising genius, most generously promoted a subscription among the gentry in those parts.\\" Subsequent history The Old Bridge with steps ascending the bridge The Old Bridge was so steep that horse carts had difficulty crossing it. By 1857, a new bridge, the Victoria Bridge, was built next to the Old Bridge, which was paid for by the people of Pontypridd. The Victoria Bridge is a three-arch bridge, built by Thomas Jenkins, that did not have a problem with roadway steepness. Since the bridge was opened in 1756, it has been the subject for many landscape artists, including Richard Wilson and Turner. The Old Bridge is now a scheduled monument and is also depicted in emblems of local sport teams, including Pontypridd F.C. Pontypridd RFC and Cilfynydd RFC. Artist Lulu Quinn was commissioned by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council to illuminate the Old Bridge as part of a regeneration programme for Pontypridd called the Monument Illumination Scheme. Initial tests to illuminate the bridge took place on 19 August 2008, and the project was officially launched after successful testing. Bridge imagery Pontypridd Rugby Football Club displays an image of the Old Bridge with its cylindrical voids (holes) Representations of Old Bridge can be seen in local heraldic and civic stationery, including the crest of Pontypridd Rugby Football Club, Pontypridd Football Club and Cilfynydd Rugby Football Club. The community-to-community organisation PONT (Partnerships Overseas Networking Trust), also bases its logo upon the Bridge. Pontypridd High School in Cilfynydd incorporates the bridge design into the school shield, as does Pontypridd Town Council with its logo representing the South Wales Valleys and a section of the Old Bridge in the foreground. Pontypridd Male Voice Choir also incorporates the Old Bridge in the choir logo. See also * List of bridges in Wales * Old Bridge for other bridges with the same name.

Raised in Izumi and then Izumiōtsu, she attended Hamadera Elementary School and began learning traditional Japanese dance from Rokunosuke Hanayagi (花柳禄之助) of the Rokuju Hanayagi (花柳禄寿) school. She graduated from what is now Kyoto Ōki High School. She won the first Miss Nippon beauty contest in 1950. In 1953 she made her film debut at the Daiei Studios. She became one of Daiei's top actresses. Yamamoto was considered one of Japan's most beautiful women, with \\"noble\\" features that represented the classic ideal of Japanese beauty. As such, she was well-suited for costumed parts in the era's popular period dramas, with her less-frequent modern roles (in films like Ozu's Equinox Flower and Ichikawa's Being Two Isn't Easy) often shot in \\"movie star\\" closeups that placed her apart from the films' contemporary storytelling. In 1963, when her contract came up for renewal, she insisted on changes. The head of Daiei, Masaichi Nagata, refused, unilaterally fired her, and then invoked an agreement between the major studios to prevent her from working again in film. Even though she has appeared frequently on stage and on television, she has not appeared in a film since then.

Cashman was used during his career mostly as a ruckman and forward. He was recruited locally to Fitzroy and kicked 25 goals for them in 1929. In 1932 he went to Western Australia and took on the role of captain-coach of West Perth, steering them to their first WAFL premiership since 1905 in his first year in charge. He led West Perth to a third place the following season and was lured back to Fitzroy where he was appointed captain-coach. After just two games as captain-coach of Fitzroy, Cashman resigned, citing that members of the club committee were against him. A four-time VFL interstate representative, he got a clearance to Carlton and finished the season there, kicking 19 goals up forward. Although he started the 1935 season at Carlton, he ended up at Yarraville and was a centre half forward in their premiership that year.

Biography Vivian was born in Cornwood, Devon, not far from Dartmoor, the son of William Henry Vivian, a carpenter. He was educated at the local Church of England or 'national' school and following a period as an apprentice to a local carpenter, he moved to London for work. In August 1894, he married Harriett Helen Sturgeon, the daughter of an Inland Revenue supervisor. Together with their daughterMark Pottle, Henry Harvey Vivian in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; OUP 2004–09 they lived in Burgoyne Road, Harringay.1901 Census shows Vivian living at 15 Burgoyne Road. By 1911 he was recorded as living at number 11. Vivian's spiritual beliefs appear to have been very much in line with his political ones. John Burns, on opening a new recreation ground at Brentham in June 1908, described him as a practical mystic Career Trade unionist Like his father, Vivian was a carpenter by trade and became an active trade union organiser. He was for a time President of the Pimlico Society of Carpenters and Joiners.The Times, 31 May 1930 p. 14 Co-partnership He was a strong believer in the ideals of the cooperative movement being a member of the Central Board of the Cooperative Congress for the London regionThe Times, 4 June 1895 p. 5 and of co- partnership in industry and society which he believed made industrial harmony more likely as employees gained a direct stake in the ownership and success (through profit-sharing) of the companies for which they worked.The Times, 24 August 1904 p. 4 He was a leader in the co-partnership housing movement, a campaigning secretary of the Labour Co-partnership Association, chairman of the Co-partnership Tenants' Housing Council and of Co-partnership Tenants Ltd.The Times House of Commons 1910; Politico’s Publishing 2004 p. 31 He also co-founded and edited the journal Labour Co-partnership.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Urban planner Vivian set up a company called General Builders Ltd., a practical venture into co-partnership with the aim of providing its members with work and accommodation. One of Vivian's most enduring achievements was the building of the Brentham Garden Suburb in the Pitshanger area of Ealing following the philosophy of the garden city movement promoted by Ebenezer Howard. Brentham featured a social institute, library, tennis courts and a bowling green. In addition the houses were designed with large gardens and the house attracted interest from British and foreign urban planners. He was chairman on the project's management body, Ealing Tenants Ltd from its inception in 1901. Although he resigned the chairmanship in 1911, he remained on the committee until his death. At the invitation of the Governor-General, Vivian made a tour of Canada in 1910 to promote similar schemes and lecture on town planning, housing conditions, sanitation and public health.John Christopher Bacher, Keeping to the Marketplace: The Evolution of Canadian Housing Policy; McGill-Queen's Press, 1993 p. 50 Co-Partnership Tenants Ltd went on to play an important role in the development of the garden city of Letchworth and of Hampstead Garden Suburb.Gordon Emanuel Cherry (ed.), Pioneers in British Planning; Architectural Press, 1981 pp. 14, 82 Politics Henry Vivian Vivian was a Free Trade LiberalThe Times, 28 September 1903 p. 4The Times, 12 July 1905 p. 11 not a socialist. While he did not believe in votes for women,P. F. Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism; Cambridge University Press, 2007 p. 120 as his support for co- partnership demonstrated, he believed in the Liberal virtues of self-reliance, self-help and freedom from state interference. He was first elected to Parliament at the 1906 general election as Liberal candidate for Birkenhead, in Cheshire. He opposed the movement of Trade Union MPs into the Labour Party in 1908.The Times, 19 June 1908 p. 7 He voted against what he saw as socialist measures such as the Unemployed Workmen Bill which placed a duty on local committees to provide work or relief for the unemployed. Vivian held his Birkenhead seat at the general election of January 1910, albeit by the narrow margin of 144 votes. In December 1910 however, when he was subject to attacks from the left accusing him of being 'the workers' enemy' and urging socialists to vote against him,P. F. Clarke, Lancashire and the New Liberalism; Cambridge University Press, 2007 p. 337 he lost to the Unionists. South Somerset by- election, 1911 Vivian got a chance to re-enter the House of Commons in 1911 when the Liberal MP for South Somerset, Sir Edward Strachey, was given a peerage, causing a by-election. Vivian was adopted as Liberal candidate.The Times 2 November 1911 p. 8 South Somerset had been a Liberal seat since its creation in 1885 and Strachey had been MP for the constituency since 1892 but the size of his majorities had been decreasing since 1906 and the Conservative candidate in the by-election, Aubrey Herbert, had the advantage of being known in the area, having been the candidate in both the general elections of 1910. The election seems to have fought mostly on the issue of the National Insurance Act.The Times, 14 November 1911 p. 10The Times, 16 November 1911 p. 8 On 13 November, in a portent of things to come, the Unionists won a Liberal seat in a by-election at Oldham.

The National Liberal topped the poll and Vivian lost his deposit.F. W. S. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p. 205 1923–1924 By the time of the 1923 general election the two wings of the Liberal Party had re- united and Vivian was chosen as candidate for Totnes in his home county of Devon. He beat the sitting Tory MP Samuel Harvey by a majority of 502 votes. However this margin was too narrow to hold against a resurgent Conservative Party at the 1924 election and Harvey regained the seat.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918–1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p. 333 Vivian did not stand for Parliament again but remained interested in Liberal politics as an active member of Hornsey Liberal Association.Pottle, DNB Political and public appointments In 1906 Vivian was appointed a member of the Royal Commission on Canals and Waterways.The Times, 5 March 1906 p. 4 He was a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Housing and Town Planning and of a Home Office Departmental Committee on Accidents in Factories and Workshops. After the First World War, Vivian became an enthusiastic supporter of the League of Nations and he was chairman of his local branch of the League of Nations Union in Hornsey.

The first two tracks to be recorded were \\"Peaceful\\" and \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" on May 10. \\"Come Away, Melinda\\", \\"Papa's Medicine Show\\", and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" were recorded on May 13, 14, and 15, respectively, with the latter two titles being overdubbed on May 29. \\"Sweete Peony\\", \\"Ace Insurance Man\\", and \\"Sittin' Pretty\\" were recorded in June at EMI Studios in London, during sessions booked around Gentry's filming schedule for her first BBC series. The album was completed back in the United States on July 20 when \\"Casket Vignette\\", \\"The Fool on the Hill\\", and \\"Recollection\\" were recorded. Content The album is a departure from Gentry's previous albums which were almost entirely self-penned. She only composed five of the album's eleven tracks. Among the remaining six tracks, three are Beatles covers. The album is more pop than her previous two albums, which featured more regional music, specifically country. The albums opens with the sinister eroticism of the Gentry-penned \\"Sweete Peony\\". The second track, \\"Casket Vignette\\", is a commentary on the funeral parlor business and was composed by Gentry on a plane. \\"Come Away, Melinda\\" is a cover of a popular anti-war song. This is followed by the album's first Beatles cover, \\"The Fool on the Hill\\". Track five is another cover, \\"Papa's Medicine Show\\". Side one closes with \\"Ace Insurance Man\\", a Gentry original showing the comical side of small town intrigue and gossip. Side two opens with \\"Recollection\\", a Gentry original chronicling a young girl trying to come to terms with mortality. The chilled out \\"Sittin' Pretty\\" follows and was written by Gentry with producer Kelly Gordon. The album's second Beatles cover is \\"Eleanor Rigby\\"; with its story of small-town loneliness and death is the only Beatles cover that fits well with Gentry's own songwriting. Track ten is a cover of Kenny Rankin's \\"Peaceful\\". The album closes with the final Beatles cover, \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" which features a gorgeous vocal from Gentry and a '60s lounge style arrangement. Title and artwork The album's title, Local Gentry, refers to \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\", sometimes referred to as \\"gentry.\\" The album's cover art features a double exposure like Gentry's previous album, The Delta Sweete. This time it is a photo of Gentry in a red trouser suit and polka-dot shirt, which she designed herself, overlaid with drawings of the characters or \\"local gentry\\" from the songs on the album. Critical reception Billboard’s review of the album, published in the issue dated September 7, 1968, said, \\"Bobbie (Billie Joe) Gentry deserts the Delta for Beatle land, including a stunning \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" as well as her own dusty Delta dramas. Mississippi melodies includes the self-penned \\"Sweete Peony\\" and \\"Ace Insurance Man\\", both sensitively set against the Beatles' \\"Here, There and Everywhere” and Kenny Rankin’s \\"Peaceful\\" – all with lush arrangements tuned in on the charts.\\" Cashbox published a review on September 7 also, which said, \\"Bobbie Gentry bids fair to reestablish herself on the best-seller charts with this sensitive album of song and story. The artist has written four of the eleven tunes on the set, including \\"Sweete Peony\\", \\"Casket Vignette\\", \\"Ace Insurance Man\\" and \\"Recollection\\". Miss Gentry's singing is particularly beautiful here, creating moods of haunting fragility.\\" A review from Record World said, \\"With a voice as soft as fur, Bobbie sings about the people who people her life. About half of the material is her own rich work. Other songs are \\"Come Away, Melinda\\", \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\".\\" Jason Ankeny of All Music gave a positive review of the album, concluding that the album \\"is an exquisitely wrought collection of character studies steeped in the myth and lore of Southern culture -- from the funeral parlor director portrayed in \\"Casket Vignette\\" to the titular \\"Ace Insurance Man,\\" Bobbie Gentry etches a series of revealing, well-observed narratives populated by folks both larger-than-life and small-time, adding up to something not unlike a country-pop Spoon River Anthology.\\" Commercial performance The album did not appear on any major music charts. The album's two singles, \\"Sweete Peony\\" and \\"The Fool on the Hill\\" also failed to chart. Reissues In 2006, Australian label Raven Records released the album on CD for the first time, paired with 1968’s The Delta Sweete. In 2007, the album was made available for digital download.

Early life Ionescu was born in Fălticeni, Suceava, daughter of Constantin Ogrezeanu, a bank cashier, and Maria Ogrezeanu, housewife. Ionescu's interest in medicine began after she met one of her best friends Aurelia Dumitru, and her father Dr. Dumitru. The death of one of her school friends, who died in Paris due to an infection after brain surgery, impelled Ionescu to apply to medical school. Education Supported by her mother, she applied to medical school in Bucharest in 1939. In her first internship year, she studied ophthalmology. Next year, she spent in Suceava at a poorly-equipped clinic during a typhus epidemic. During a school break, she volunteered to take care of Soviet prisoners at Stamate Hospital in Fălticeni. She entered the surgical service of the hospital, doing her first surgical operations, mostly amputations. In October 1943, she became an intern at Hospital Nr. 9 in Bucharest. In 1944, during the bombing of Bucharest, she was forced to perform an emergency brain surgery on an injured boy due to lack of sufficient medical staff. In 1945, she became certified in medicine and surgery.Mihailide, Mihail (5 December 2011) O legendă a neurochirurgiei româneşti. viata-medicala.ro.

It was approved on 28 April 1992 through a national referendum after 92% support. It defines the fundamental political principles, establishing the structure, procedures, powers and duties of the government, structure of the judiciary and legislature, and spells out the fundamental rights and duties of citizens. It is made up of 26 chapters, not including the preamble. In part, the constitution was designed to decentralize the government in Ghana.  Division of powers  The 1992 constitution, as the supreme law of the land, provides for the sharing of powers among a president, a parliament, a cabinet, a Council of State, and an independent judiciary. Through its system of checks and balances, it avoids bestowing preponderant power on any specific branch of government. Executive authority is shared by the president, the twenty-five member Council of State, and numerous advisory bodies, including the National Security Council. The president is head of state, head of government, and commander in chief of the armed forces of Ghana. He also appoints the vice president. Legislative functions are vested in the National Parliament, which consists of a unicameral 200-member body plus the president. To become law, legislation must have the assent of the president, who has a qualified veto over all bills except those to which a vote of urgency is attached. Members of parliament are popularly elected by universal adult suffrage for terms of four years, except in war time, when terms may be extended for not more than twelve months at a time beyond the four years. The structure and the power of the judiciary are independent of all other branches of government. The Supreme Court has broad powers of judicial review; it rules on the constitutionality of any legislative or executive action at the request of any aggrieved citizen. The hierarchy of courts derives largely from British juridical forms. The hierarchy, called the Superior Court of Judicature, is composed of the Supreme Court of Ghana, the Court of Appeal (Appellate Court), the High Court of Justice, regional tribunals, and such lower courts or tribunals as parliament may establish. The courts have jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters. The 1992 constitution, like previous constitutions, guarantees the institution of chieftaincy together with its traditional councils as established by customary law and usage. The National House of Chiefs, without executive or legislative power, advises on all matters affecting the country's chieftaincy and customary law.

Retrieved 13 February 2011 The centre also hosts musical events for the public, including concerts, workshops and seminars.The Jerusalem Music Center Site of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Retrieved 13 February 2011 History The Jerusalem Music Centre was established in 1973, at the initiative of the violinist and educator Isaac Stern, Jerusalem’s mayor at the time, Teddy Kollek, and British philosopher Isaiah Berlin. The Program for Excelling Young Violinists, including master classes with well-known musicians and chamber ensembles for young musicians, was established in 1980. The Excelling Musicians Program in the IDF, which allows young musicians to continue their studies and development during their military service, was established in 1985 together with the Jerusalem Music Centre. The Jerusalem Quartet, Israel’s first professional chamber group, was formed under the auspices of the Centre and other institutions in 1997. In 2000, the Jerusalem Music Centre established a program for teaching string instruments in elementary schools in Jerusalem and the periphery, together with the Education Ministry. In 2009, the renowned pianist Murray Perahia was appointed president of the Jerusalem Music Center. Perahia is known for his emphasis on musical theory and the intelligent execution of musical works. Programs for Excelling Young Musicians The Programs for excelling young musicians are a whole cluster of programs intended for primary and high school children, typically designed for long-term participation, focusing on children aged 14–18. The programs’ goal is to significantly enhance the musical education that the participants receive from other sources, such as private teachers or the local conservatory. These programs focus on playing chamber music: Chamber music emphasizes the inclusive, non-competitive and social nature of music; the teaching of chamber music requires resources and expertise beyond the reach of most schools; and, more often than not, chamber music is the most complex, deep and challenging music. Thus, in the beginning of every school year, participants form ensembles – string quartets, piano trios and so on – and meet for weekly or bi-weekly rehearsals with senior coaches. 6-8 times a year, participants are gathered for an intensive weekend, which allow for more intensive work, the creation of ad hoc different (some times larger) ensembles, as well as special topical workshops (music analysis, rhythm, improvisation, non-western music, contemporary and Israeli music and so on), lectures by various experts, and concerts in which the ensembles play for each other and for their teachers. Twice a year, the participants take part in an intensive 3-week summer course, at end of which they form the Young Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra, and perform in central halls in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Special programs * '’’Teaching string instruments in elementary schools’’’: This project is aimed at introducing the violin and cello to second- and third-grade pupils attending ten schools in Israel's geographic periphery. The children study violin and cello in small groups, then progress to private lessons and to playing in the school ensemble. The program also includes school concerts, performing with children from other schools, and meetings with outstanding musicians from the Jerusalem Music Centre. * '’’The Classical Arabic Music Ensemble’’’, comprising 10 musicians, Arabs and Jews, specializing in Arab and Mediterranean music. Location and Facilities The Centre houses a hall for lectures, concerts and lessons, a number of smaller studios, and an audio and video recording studio.

It was a member of the Delta family of rockets. Several variants existed, differentiated by a four digit numerical code. The same first stage and boosters were used on all variants. The first stage was an Extended Long Tank Thor, a further stretched version of the Long Tank Thor used on earlier versions, itself derived from the Thor missile. Four, six or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift- off. These improvements permitted the Delta 1000 series to lift 1,835 kg (4,045 lbs) to LEO or 635 kg (1,400 lbs) to GTO. The nickname \\"Straight-Eight\\" comes from the fact that its second stage variants had the same 8 ft. (2.4 m) diameter as the first stage; previous Delta second stages were smaller in diameter. Two different second stages were flown, depending on the variant: * The Delta-F second stage, featuring the Aerojet AJ10-118G engine, was flown on three launches, with Explorer 47, 50 and 51; the Aerojet engine was flown for the (Anik A1) satellite launch (mistakenly marked as xx1x in Delta 1000 series) * The Delta-P second stage, featuring the new TRW TR-201 engine, was used for two launches each in 1973 and 1975. Some flights used a third stage, either the Thiokol Star-37D or Star-37E, for launches beyond low Earth orbit. One probe launched by the Delta 1000 series, Delta 1913, was Explorer 49 that was placed into lunar orbit on 10 June 1973.

He was born in Cheltenham and is married to the English figurative painter Cathryn Kuhfeld, née Showan. They have two daughters who have often appeared in their paintings. Biography Kuhfeld is the only child of a German prisoner of war and an English classical pianist. Between 1972 and 1976 he studied at Leicester School of Art. He worked from 1976 to 1978 at Rugby School of Art, where he gave lessons in drawing and painting, before securing a place at the prestigious Royal Academy School of Art. During 1977-80 Kuhfeld studied under the painter Peter Greenham CBE, RA. In 1978 he was created a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painters. While at the Royal Academy Schools Kuhfeld won various notable scholarships and prizes: 1978-79 David Murray Landscape Prize; 1979 Royal Academy of Art Silver Medal for Drawing, Royal College of Surgeons Dooley Prize for Anatomical Drawing; 1980 Elizabeth Greenshield Foundation Scholarship and Richard Ford Scholarship for study in Spain. In 1985 the New Grafton Gallery in London gave Kuhfeld his first major exhibition, with the painter Christa Ga, which helped establish him as one of the up-and-coming members of the New English Art movement. In 1986 Kuhfeld was elected to membership of the New English Art Club. In 1992 he became an elected member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, which he resigned in 2005. In 2009, he unveiled a portrait of Harry Patch, the oldest man in Europe and last surviving World War I soldier, which Kuhfeld called \\"a privilege\\" and \\"was struck by this extraordinary man\\". In 2012, he was commissioned by Charles, Prince of Wales to paint the royal wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Prince Charles has been a patron of his and Kuhfeld painted portraits of Prince William and Prince Harry in 1986.

A survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp, he was the author of several books about Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, including Das Dritte Reich und die Juden (with Léon Poliakov, 1955); Heinrich Himmler (1960); and Martin Bormann: Hitlers Schatten (1962). The House of the Wannsee Conference museum in Berlin houses the Joseph Wulf Library in his honour.; \\"Joseph Wulf Library\\". House of the Wannsee Conference. Early life Born in Chemnitz, Germany, the child of a wealthy Jewish merchant, Wulf was raised from 1917 in Krakow, Poland, and educated there in Jewish studies and agriculture. His father had hoped he would become a rabbi, but he turned instead to writing. He married Jenta Falik-Dachner, with whom he had a son, David.; for the name of his son, . The Holocaust After Nazi Germany occupied Poland in 1939, sparking World War II, the Wulf family was deported to the Krakow Ghetto. Wulf joined a group of Jewish resistance fighters, but he was captured and imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He survived after fleeing, on 18 January 1945, during one of the notorious death marches that took place just before the camp's liberation, when the SS forced inmates to move to different camps. Wulf's wife and son survived the war by hiding with Polish peasants, but he lost his father, mother, brother, mother-in-law, and young niece.; for Polish peasants, see . Writing and research At the end of the war, Wulf remained in Poland, where from 1945 to 1947 he co-founded the Central Jewish Historical Commission, publishing documents about Nazi Germany. He moved to Stockholm and in the summer of 1947 to Paris, working for a newspaper and the Centre pour l'Histoire des Juifs Polonais, where he met Léon Poliakov, the French historian. In 1952 he and his wife moved to Berlin.; . Steven Lehrer writes that Wulf \\"cut an unmistakeable figure ... [h]e dressed impeccably, carried a walking stick, and held a long cigarette holder clenched between his teeth at a jaunty angle.\\" Wulf and Poliakov co-wrote Das Dritte Reich und die Juden (\\"The Third Reich and the Jews\\"), 1955, published in Berlin by the Arani Verlag. It was followed by two more volumes, Das Dritte Reich und seine Diener (\\"The Third Reich and its Servants\\"), 1956, and Das Dritte Reich und seine Denker (\\"The Third Reich and its Thinkers\\"), 1959. Nicolas Berg writes that the work \\"marked the breaking of a West German taboo\\", placing the Holocaust at the centre of its study of Nazi Germany, unlike the approach of other German historians at the time, and using direct language. Violence and mass murder had been goals of the regime, they wrote, not a means to achieve some other goal. According to Berg, the books were generally regarded as important, but German historians looked down on them as unscholarly. The first volume included a document signed by Otto Bräutigam, an adviser to Konrad Adenauer, West German Chancellor from 1949 to 1963. Bräutigam had worked for the Nazi's Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories. The document signed by Bräutigam said: \\"Through word of mouth, clarity may well have meanwhile been reached in the Jewish Question,\\" an apparent reference to the Final Solution to the Jewish Question. The publication of this document attracted national and international press coverage. The Federal Defence Ministry refused to include the first volume in its list of books recommended for the German army's libraries, because it contained documents signed by military leaders during the Third Reich who were still active in West Germany. Wulf went on to publish several more works about Nazi Germany, among them biographies of Heinrich Himmler and Martin Bormann. In 1961 he won the Leo Baeck Prize and in 1964 the Carl von Ossietzky Medal. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate by the Free University of Berlin. Wannsee memorial Proposal Am Großen Wannsee 56–58, Berlin In 1965 Wulf proposed that the villa in Berlin in which the 1942 Wannsee Conference was held should be made into a Holocaust memorial and research centre. During the Wannsee Conference, Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the Reich Main Security Office, had outlined to several leading Nazis, in somewhat coded language, the German government's plan to enact the Final Solution. In August 1966 Wulf co- founded, with Friedrich Zipfel and Peter Heilmann, the International Document Center Organization for the Study of National Socialism and Its Aftermath, and began campaigning to have it housed in the Wannsee Conference villa. Wulf abandoned his efforts in 1971. The German government was not interested in moving forward with the idea at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. The issue of the memorial was so politically sensitive in Germany that Wulf apparently needed police protection because of threats. Klaus Schütz, then mayor of West Berlin, said he did not want any \\"macabre cult site\\". Death Memorial plaque at Wulf's home in Berlin-Charlottenburg Despondent, Wulf committed suicide on 10 October 1974 by jumping from the fifth-floor window of his apartment at Giesebrechtstraße 12, Berlin-Charlottenburg. For three years, he had planned to write a 500-page history of East European Jewry. A publisher's letter accepting his proposal arrived on the day of his death and was found unopened. In his last letter to his son, David, he wrote, \\"I have published 18 books about the Third Reich and they have had no effect. You can document everything to death for the Germans. There is a democratic regime in Bonn. Yet the mass murderers walk around free, live in their little houses, and grow flowers.\\" Wulf is buried in Holon on the central coast of Israel, south of Tel Aviv. In early 1974, he had written in an open letter, \\"Appeal to the German intellectual public\\", intended for submission to Die Zeit, that he did not want to be buried in Germany: \\"For a conscious Jew living and working in Europe, how you Christians forget what you have done with Jews over two thousand years, how you Germans forget that you have exterminated six million Jews, only becomes clear on Israeli soil. On Israeli soil, all of Europe seems to be in a sort of Orwellian condition.\\" Museum In 1986 the mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen, announced that a memorial would indeed be built at the Wannsee villa. On 20 January 1992, on the 50th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust memorial and museum. In the dining room where the conference was held, photographs and biographies of the participants hang on the wall. The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of the Holocaust and its planning. The Joseph Wulf Mediothek on the second floor, a reference library, houses over 65,000 books, 10,000 films, 120 journal subscriptions, and materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.

In 2018, Haile was elected a Fellow of the Materials Research Society. Early life Haile was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1966. Her family fled Ethiopia during the coup in the mid-'70s, after soldiers arrested and nearly killed her historian father. Around age 10, the family settled in rural Minnesota where Haile attended Saint John's Preparatory School (Collegeville, MN), graduating in 1983.  Education  She received her Bachelor of Science and PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She also has a Master of Science from the University of California, Berkeley. Advised by Bernhardt J. Wuensch, her PhD thesis is entitled \\"Synthesis, crystal structure and ionic conductivity of some alkali rare earth silicates.\\" Haile spent three years as an assistant professor at the University of Washington, Seattle. She joined the Caltech faculty in 1996, where she worked for 18 years before moving to Northwestern University in 2015. At Northwestern, Haile is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and a Professor of Applied Physics. Alternative fuel Haile created the first solid-acid fuel cell in the late 1990s, using a new type of \\"superprotonic\\" compound. Fuel-cell makers balked at the changes needed for her solution. Two of her former graduate students formed the start-up Superprotonic to commercialize the device. Haile has shared some of the ideas behind this work during TEDxBermuda where she gave a talk entitled: \\"Fuel from the Air.\\" Research  Solid-state ionics  Haile's research centers on ionic conduction in solids. Her objectives are to understand the mechanisms that govern ion transport and to apply that understanding to the development of advanced solid electrolytes and novel solid-state electrochemical devices. Applications of fast ion conductors include batteries, sensors, ion pumps, and fuel cells. The latter is her particular concern. Her group is investigating proton-conducting solid acid compounds, proton-conducting perovskites, mixed oxygen- and electron-conducting perovskites, oxygen-conducting oxides, and alkali-conducting silicates. The group's standard technique for the characterization of electrical properties is A.C. impedance spectroscopy. Ionic conductivity is closely tied to the crystal structure of and structural transitions in the conducting solid. Crystal growth, structure determination by X-ray and neutron diffraction, and thermal analysis are also important aspects of Dr. Haile's research. The group showed for example, that a broad range of proton containing solids undergo a monoclinic to cubic transition that is accompanied by an increase in conductivity of several orders of magnitude. In another example, her group demonstrated that Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-d has exceptional activity as a cathode for ceria-based solid oxide fuel cells. Haile's work in solid state ionics is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Army Research Office, and the Department of Energy. In the past, support has also been provided by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research, the California Energy Commission, the Powell Foundation, and the Kirsch Foundation. Industrial support has been provided by General Motors, EPRI (formerly Electric Power Research Institute), HRL (formerly Hughes Research Labs), and Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal and now General Electric).  Thermoelectric and ferroelectric materials  Haile's research includes the investigation of structure-property relations in thermoelectric materials, in collaboration with colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and ferroelectric materials as part of a multidisciplinary program at Caltech dedicated to the computational prediction/optimization of material and device behavior. The project was supported by NSF and the Army Research Office through the Caltech Center for the Science and Engineering of Materials.  Device development  Device development plays an increasingly important role in her research. Micropower generators, based on solid oxide fuel cells are particularly attractive for portable power and were the subject of a DARPA project. Similarly, microactuators and micropumps based on ferroelectric thin films hold promise for advancing Microelectromechanical systems technology and development efforts are sponsored by an ARO MURI program. Both programs are highly interdisciplinary.

Mason was the eldest son of United States patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention, George Mason IV and his wife Ann Eilbeck. He received his early education from private tutors at Gunston Hall and was given Lexington plantation on Mason's Neck by his father in 1774. In 1775, he named his plantation to commemorate the Battle of Lexington in Massachusetts. Mason joined the Fairfax County Independent Militia in 1775 and was elected Ensign. He developed a rheumatic disorder that plagued him for the remainder of his life. In 1776, he commanded a militia company sent to Hampton, Virginia to protect the coast from Lord Dunmore's assaults, but was forced to quit the military on account of his increasingly poor health. He travelled to France between 1779 and 1783 for business purposes and to improve his health. At his father's request, George Washington wrote Mason letters of introduction to the marquis de Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin in Paris. While in France, he settled in Nantes, where he became involved in the tobacco trade and occasionally arranged for shipments of goods to his father. Upon the death of his father in 1792, Mason inherited the entirety of Mason's Neck. He died four years later at Lexington, on December 5, 1796, after suffering from chronic ill health for his entire adult life. He was interred in the Mason family graveyard at Gunston Hall. In 1803, his widow Betsey married George Graham. His will divided Mason's Neck into two approximately equal tracts along a north–south axis from Causeway Point to Martin Cockburn's south boundary line. His eldest son George Mason VI received the eastern tract with the ownership privilege of either Lexington or Gunston Hall, of which he chose the latter.

Orhipean, Gure Herria ezagutzen Xamar: 1996 He made several major contributions to the study of the Basque language and was the first head of the Euskaltzaindia, the Academy of the Basque Language. In spite of some justifiable criticism of an imbalance towards unusual and archaic forms and a tendency to ignore the Romance influence on Basque, he is considered one of the greatest scholars of Basque to date.Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge 1997 His full name is Resurrección de Jesús María de las Nieves Azkue Aberasturi Barrundia Uribarri but he is commonly known as Resurrección María de Azkue, R. M. Azkue or simply Azkue. Biography Azkue was born in the Biscayan town of Lekeitio, a native speaker of Basque and son of the Basque poet Eusebio Maria de los Dolores Azkue Barrundia who was from Lekeitio himself and Maria Karmen Aberasturi Uribarri from Mundaka. After having studied nautical studies in Lekeitio, he went on to Bilbao to do his baccalaureate and then Vitoria and University of Salamanca to study theology and philosophy. He gained priesthood in 1888. The same year, the Foral Government of Biscay invited new applicants for the chair of Basque Studies. Azkue, Sabino Arana and Miguel de Unamuno all applied but Azkue was awarded the position. In the following period, he initiated many initiatives related to orthographic issues and the teaching of Basque, including the two magazines Euskalzale and Ibaizabal. Although he considered himself a Basque patriot (or abertzale) and although he was in contact with nationalist figures such as Sabino Arana and Ramón de la Sota, he is not considered to have been a Carlist and frequently disagreed with Arana and de Soto, particularly on Basque linguistic issues. More enamoured with the Basque language and culture, he tried to avoid politics in favour of cultural activities. Notwithstanding, for many years there were two main camps of Basque writers and supporters of Basque culture – those that leaned towards Azkue's approach (the so-called Azkuezaleak) and those that leaned towards Arana's approach (the so-called Aranazaleak). Over time, the popularity of Arana's somewhat puristic approach eventually waned. In 1904 Azkue left Bilbao to travel Europe for 5 years, with major stops in Tours, Brussels and Cologne, where he completed his musical studies. On returning to Bilbao in 1909 he further busied himself with academic work (such as Ortzuri in 1911 and Urlo in 1914), boosting the emergence of the academic study of Basque. He was one of the most important supporters of establishing the Euskaltzaindia, the Academy of the Basque Language, at the 1918 congress of Eusko Ikaskuntza in Oñati and was its first head from its birth in 1919 onwards. He vacated his chair of Basque studies in 1920 to immerse himself fully with the work of the Euskaltzaindia, pushing initiatives to codify and promote the Basque language, against considerable opposition from official quarters and the Arana camp. His main study on Basque morphology, 'Morfología Vasca' and the collection of Basque folks songs, Cancionero Popular Vasco, fall into this period. He also developed the famous Erizkizundi Irukoitza ('Triple Questionnaire'), a substantial tool to elicit information on vocabulary, morphology and pronunciation of Basque from informants. 1935 saw the publication of Euskaleŕiaren Yakintza, a 4 volume collection of traditional lore and a major push to develop the Gipuzkera Osatua project. During the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco ordered the closure of the Euskaltzaindia but Azkue managed to avoid exile as he was both of an advanced age and not a prominent political figure. Eventually, he managed to re-open the Euskaltzaindia in 1941 with the help of the young Federico Krutwig. Azkue eventually died in 1951 shortly after accidentally falling into the Ibaizabal river in Bilbao. Studies Azkue spent most of his life studying the Basque language and his works continue to be a major source of information to anyone working with the Basque language. Most of his work focussed on lexicography, grammar and popular literature. Some of his most important works include: *Euskal Izkindea-Gramática Euskara (1891). A study on the Basque verb which Azkue in later years called a \\"sin of his youth\\" as it sought to present an idealised and \\"purified\\" picture of the Basque language. Although Azkue himself left this approach behind soon, Euskal Izkindea inspired a school of thought that for many years sought to promote such an idealised view of the Basque language. *Diccionario Vasco-Español- Francés (\\"Basque-Spanish-French dictionary\\") (1905). Originally published in two parts, this is the publication that Azkue is most widely known for today. It lists Basque words from all Basque dialects in unmodified form and is considered a major source of dialectal material. Azkue collected the data for this dictionary from existing sources and his own research. It has been reprinted numerous times. *Diccionario de Bolsillo Vasco-Español y Español- Vasco (1918), a Spanish-Basque pocket dictionary. *Cancionero Popular Vasco (1918–1921), a compilation of music and songs. *Morfología Vasca (1923), a study on Basque suffixes. This publication too still constitutes a major source of information on morphological data, including forms and features that are no longer in use. *Euskaleŕiaren Yakintza (\\"the knowledge of the Basque Country\\") (1935–1947), a major collection of traditional basque lore. *Gipuzkera osotua (1935), Azkue's documentation on a standardised form of Gipuzkoan. Between them, Euskaleŕiaren Yakintza and Cancionero constitute a major collection of Basque folklore, containing songs, poems, soties, children's games, tonguetwisters, customs, beliefs, folk remedies and over 2900 proverbs. He also revised Lucien Bonaparte's original distinction of eight dialects into seven. Contribution to Batua In relation to the efforts to find a literary standard for the Basque language, Azkue was a proponent of Gipuzkera Osatua ('Completed Gipuzkoan'). This was in essence a codified form of the Gipuzkoan dialect as the balance of power had by then shifted from the Northern Basque dialects to the South, with the majority of Basque speakers now concentrated in Biscay and Gipuzkoa. His novels, such as Ardi Galdua ('the lost sheep'), were written in Gipuzkera Osatua and it was to be a major influence on the later development of Standard Basque. References *Etxegoien, J.

The intention is to ensure that those who fund health research are aware of what matters to patients, carers and clinicians who need to use the research in their everyday lives. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funds the coordination of the JLA, but Priority Setting Partnerships find their own resources to fund their partnership. In 2016 the James Lind Alliance was granted the Societal Award of the Foundation Federation of Dutch Medical Scientific Societies (Federa) for their initiative to bring patients into partnerships for research priorities.https://federa.org/Participation%20by%20patients%20in%20science  Background  Research on the effects of treatments often overlooks the shared interests of patients and clinicians. As a result, questions they both consider important are not addressed. The pharmaceutical and medical technology industries and academia play essential roles in developing new treatments, but their priorities are not necessarily the same as those of patients and clinicians. For this reason many areas of potentially valuable research are neglected. Bringing patients and clinicians together to jointly prioritise unanswered questions is thought to be rare.British Medical Journal 2008;336:903-904 (26 April),  Method of operation  The James Lind Alliance brings together patients and patient representatives, carers and clinicians, as individuals or represented by groups, to form Priority Setting Partnerships, focusing on specific health conditions or settings. For example, the Asthma Priority Setting Partnership was led by Asthma UK and the British Thoracic Society, while the Urinary Incontinence Priority Setting Partnership was led by the Bladder & Bowel Foundation and the Cochrane Incontinence Group , part of the Cochrane Collaboration. Priority Setting Partnerships work together to gather uncertainties from patients, carers and clinicians. The uncertainties are all checked to ensure they cannot be answered by existing knowledge, research or sources of information. The uncertainties then go through a process of prioritisation, which aims to culminate in a top ten list of priorities for research, shared by patients, carers and clinicians. To date, the process has been completed for over 75 health areas including Urinary Incontinence, Anaesthetics and Perioperative Care, Living With and Beyond Cancer, Intensive Care, Prostate Cancer, Cystic Fibrosis, Oral and Dental Health, Mental Health in Children and Young People, and Surgery for Common Shoulder Problems.  James Lind  The Alliance is named after a pioneer of clinical trials, James Lind (1716–1794). Two hundred and fifty years ago, there were many conflicting ideas and unanswered questions about how to treat the deadly disease scurvy. Lind, a Scottish naval surgeon, decided to confront this uncertainty by treating his patients within a clinical trial comparing six of the proposed remedies. His trial showed that oranges and lemons were dramatically better than the other supposed treatments.James Lind Library, biography of James Lind  References   External links  * James Lind Alliance http://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk * James Lind Library http://www.jameslindlibrary.org Category:British medical research Category:Health economics Category:Health in Hampshire Category:Organisations based in Southampton Category:Research institutes in Hampshire Category:University of Southampton ","title":"James Lind Alliance"},{"id":"21548280","text":"The Usual Suspects is the 9th solo album of Joe Lynn Turner released in Japan in 2005.

Notable buildings Sarsden House is a country house, rebuilt in 1689 after it was damaged by fire. In 1795 Humphry Repton landscaped the park, adding a serpentine lake and a Doric temple. In about 1825 Repton's son, the architect GS Repton, remodelled the house for James Langston. The house is a Grade II* listed building. The Church of England parish church of Saint James was rebuilt in 1760. GS Repton added a cruciform extension to the east in 1823. In 1896 the architect Walter Mills of Banbury remodelled the north transept and added the bellcote. Sarsgrove House, or the Dower House, is northeast of Sarsden.

In its simplest form, it is a 3 dB coupler and is thus an alternative to a magic tee. Compared to the magic tee, it has the advantage of being easy to realize in planar technologies such as microstrip and stripline, although waveguide rat races are also practical. Unlike magic tees, a rat-race needs no matching structure to achieve correct operation. The rat-race coupler has four ports, each placed one-quarter wavelength away from each other around the top half of the ring. The bottom half of the ring is three-quarter wavelengths in length. The ring has a characteristic impedance of factor \\\\sqrt{2} compared to port impedance. A signal input on port 1, will be split between ports 2 and 4, and port 3 will be isolated. The full scattering matrix for an ideal 3 dB rat-race is :S = \\\\frac{-i}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} Arithmetics with rat-race coupler Rat-race couplers are used to sum two in-phase combined signals with essentially no loss or to equally split an input signal with no resultant phase difference between its outputs. It is also possible to configure the coupler as a 180 degree phase-shifted output divider or to sum two 180 degree phase-shifted combined signals with almost no loss.

He is one of the most significant personalities of the contemporary Czech, but also European music scene. Richard's music represents a mixture of various music styles including funk, Pop, Rock, modern jazz, hardcore and its fusion with the classical music.  Music beginnings and education  Richard showed talent for music already in his early childhood. He wasn't even three years old when he started to play harmonica, gradually he learned to play piano and percussion. He pursued his music ambitions by performing in the children's orchestra under the guidance of his uncle Jirka. After the break-up of the orchestra the thirteen-year-old Richard switched to the bass guitar which he plays until today. At the beginning he studied music on his own, until he took private lessons from the professor Vladimír Hora (1987–1989) and in 1998 till 1999 he continued his music education under the supervision of Prof. Hora at the Conservatory of Jaroslav Ježek in Prague, where he in addition to playing the bass guitar took also singing lessons.  Music career  Richard rehearsing before a concert After performing with regional bands Richard gained in 1986 his first professional engagement in the band called Natural for approximately four years. After that he performed in the band Buran Prášil, later in 1990 it was the band of Dalibor Janda. The encounter with the musician and composer Milan Steigerwald meant another important move in Richard's professional career – for the coming twelve years he became the member of the band King Size. Although the band stopped performing, it still exists and Richard and his son Richard appear as guest artists with it. At the same time, he appeared as guest artist in the recordings of several pop artists, such as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá and Lenka Filipová. He participated on the recording of the pop album of the band Damiens Nechci zůstat sám/ I don't want to be alone together with Láďa Křížek. It is worth mentioning the Golden Disc Award (Zlatá deska) he was given for his contribution to this album. He has also contributed to various jazz projects, such as the band Blue Birds of the saxophonist Ivan Myslikovjan, saxophonist Andrea Kolmanová (together with the son Richard he also participated on the recording of her CD Andrea) and many others. For the time being, he is a member of the rock band Pražský Výběr II/ Prague Selection II, led by a composer, singer and political activist Michael Kocáb. During the year 2007 he went on the concert tour with PV II , performing at the festivals and participated on all activities that have to do with the rock band (studio work on other projects, radio performance, video clips...). In the same year, the album of PV II Vymlácený rockový palice/ Smashed Rock Heads was launched and the concert PRAŽSKÝ VÝBĚR II LIVE, held on 3 May 2007 in Teplice, Czech Republic has appeared on DVD in June 2008. Career abroad Richard Scheufler during the solo concert At the end of the year 2002 Richard's steps lead to Hastings, England. He worked in the music studio of Claire Hamill and performed with local artists, such as Tom Palmer, Steve Winchester, Donna Terenzi, Mama Josie and Papa George. He gave also solo performances and started a closer cooperation with Nana Tsiboe – the former percussionist of Robbie Williams Band – in his solo project called Bushfaya. Richard worked also outside the borders of England; in 2001 he made a couple of video clips in Africa and participated at the Frankfurt Music Fair, presenting the musical instruments produced by George Dennis. Solo albums The debut solo album by Richard Scheufler called V rukou Tvých / In your hands, was launched in 2001 in Czech and English version. On this album, he established himself as a composer, solo singer, music arranger and producer. The second solo album Between us was produced between 2004 and 2008 and Richard launched it under the label Scheufler's Records in 2008. The album includes 16 tracks – instrumental and vocal compositions recorded in English with the contribution of a couple of other artists (the son Richard, Ted Whang, Peter Boška, Jiří Neužil, Štěpán Škoch, Andrea Kolmanová, Markéta Rohanová et al.). Music teaching Richard Scheufler is well-known to the music community for his teaching activities. He is the author of the audio school Slap & Funky (1994). In 2000, the video school of the same title was published as the first video school of its kind in Czech Republic. From 1997 till 2002 he was engaged as lecturer on regularly organized summer Rock courses in Dobra Voda, near Prachatice, Czech Republic. The students of the course gave the initial impetus for the recording of a CD called Jednou v roce/Once a Year. Besides that, he has carried out many workshops at various music fairs, each year in Prague since 1991 (Huvel, Muzika 2003), in Bratislava, Slovakia and in Frankfurt, Germany.  Music performance with the son Richard – Scheufler Project  The cooperation with the son Richard (born on 28 September 1988 in Partizánske, Slovakia), officially under the name Scheufler Project, enjoys a special status in his professional career. The history repeated itself and Richard junior has said yes to music in a very early age. Along with his father he performed with the King Size band, of which guest artists they are until now. At the age of twelve years, Richard junior participated on the recording of the pop album of the band Damiens Nechci zůstat sám/ I don't want to be alone, which Richard also co-produced. He also took part on the Lenka Filipová Tour and contributed to the father's second solo album Between us (Scheufler's Records, 2008). Since 2004 they both have been performing as permanent guest artists in the rock opera Antigona. Music equipment Richard is currently an EDEN endorsing Bassist. He plays the Eden WP100, WT800 and D410XST and represents the brand openly.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZdogB_xbPs In October 2004, Richard accepted the offer to cooperate with the company MusicData (distributor of the Hughes & Kettner Amplifiers) concerning the presentation of the instruments Quantum, at his solo concerts, workshops and music fairs. He also cooperates with the company Alexim presenting the analog effects and strings produced by the Swedish company EBS. In 2007, Richard started the cooperation with the company Roland and the Hungarian producer of handmade guitars Fibenare Guitars Co., which since 2006 has been developing the 6-string model Fibenare Standard RS MIDI for Richard – bass guitar using the analog and digital input. Richard's collection of music instruments includes, moreover, signed models by the company K&K;, he has been cooperating with since 1997, as follows: : Richard Scheufler model Romeo 6 strings : Richard Scheufler model Juliet 6 strings (fretless) : Slapper 4 strings : Bassman 4 strings and Yamaha TRB 6P. Studio and workshop equipment includes the Yamaha QY 700 sequencer, HDD Korg D16, Korg Pandora PX5D and Audix Microphone. When the cooperation with the MusicData and Hughes & Kettner at the end of the year 2007 was finished, Richard bought the AMPEG (Ampeg SVP-CL, Ampeg SVT PRO and Ampeg SVP-BSP) and Hafler instruments (power amp). He has been using the complete range of EBS and George Dennis Phaser for the analog effects and Roland V-Bass, Roland GR-20 and Roland GKP-4 for the digital effects.

Taki is a Japanese demon-hunting kunoichi and the greatest warrior of the Fu-Ma ninja clan, who is traveling the world on a quest to destroy the powerful swords known as Soul Edge and Soul Calibur. Taki has been introduced in the original arcade version of Soul Edge in 1995 as one of the main characters along with her friend Sophitia. Taki has been featured as a player character in every main entry in the series up until 2012's Soulcalibur V, when her place was taken by her own young disciple named Natsu, but returned in 2018's Soulcalibur VI. She has further appeared in all of Soulcalibur spin-off games, as well as in some other titles such as Namco × Capcom and Queen's Gate. She has been voiced in Japanese by Fujiko Takimoto until Soulcalibur III, and then by Sachiko Kojima in later games, while her English voice actors included Desirée Goyette. In terms of gameplay, Taki is most capable at close quarters fighting where her speed, acrobatic agility and powerful kicks are the most effective. Taki has achieved a significant popularity among the fans of the series, especially in the West. She has received mostly positive feedback, often having been for noted her iconic status in the Soul series and regarded as one of the best female ninja characters in video games as well as one of sex symbols of the fighting genre and gaming in general, sometimes being compared in these aspects to the likes of Mai Shiranui and the ninja women from Mortal Kombat. Appearances Soul games In her backstory, Taki has been raised by the Fu-Ma, a Sengoku-era mystic ninja clan based in a hidden village in Ōmi Province and connected to the Buddhist monk Tenkai,SoulCalibur: New Legends of Project Soul, page 121. having had been adopted by them after her parents and brother died from disease. As a prodigy member of the Fu-Ma, specializing in forging anti-demon equipment and in combating harmful yōkai spirits,SoulCalibur: New Legends of Project Soul, page 122. Taki became a very serious and stern fighter, regarded as most skilled in the entire clan,SoulCalibur: New Legends of Project Soul, page 111. as well as an accomplished spy and blacksmith, known for not showing her personal feelings, carrying out her mission cool- headed, and being capable of making ruthless decisions. She eventually tasks herself with destroying both the cursed Soul Edge and the blessed Soul Calibur, and is not going to show mercy to anyone representing an obstacle. Taki debuted as one of the eight original characters in Soul Edge (1995), set in the year 1584. In it, the 22-year-old Taki has dedicated herself to fighting supernatural evil and began travelling Japan to purge with her sealing magic. When her self-made magical blade Rekkimaru has been weakened by the legendary mighty evil sword known as Soul Edge, she decides to travel west to find and destroy it. The prologue of Soulcalibur (1998) tells of how at the end of Soul Edge she has confronted and defeated the game's main villain and Soul Edge's wielder, Cervantes de Leon, and obtained a fragment of the shattered sword. During that fight, Taki also saved the wounded Greek female warrior Sophitia Alexandra, who became her friend. Taki tried to merge the Soul Edge fragment with Rekkimaru without success, but when she fuses it with her other sword, Mekkimaru, she creates a new evil weapon that she seeks to pit against Soul Edge, hoping both blades would then destroy each other. However, Fu-Ma's former leader, Hachibei, steals Mekkimaru and flees, becoming a fugitive nukenin (runaway ninja). Taki's old master and adoptive father, Toki orders her to hunt down and kill Hachibei and his daughter Chie, a childhood friend of Taki, and bring back the blade. Taki locates Hachibei, but, learning about Toki's obsession with the blade, she gives a false report to Toki, leading his forces to pursue Chie's lover Li Long as a decoy. When Geki, Toki's right-hand man, discovers her deception, Taki becomes a nukenin outcast herself, carrying Mekkimaru and evading pursuers. Soulcalibur Legends (2007), which retells the events that take between Soul Edge and Soulcalibur, pits Taki, searching for the scattered shards of the Soul Edge, against Geki and his female partner Maki, both of whom eventually transformed into monsters by Soul Edge's power. Taki returns in the next sequel, Soulcalibur II (2002), set seven years after the events of Soul Edge. After hearing about the destruction of Soul Edge, she works to tame Mekkimaru, but discovers that Toki has obtained more Soul Edge fragments and decides to keep them away from him. In Soulcalibur III (2005), Taki comes back to Japan and learns that Toki's madness resulted in an internal conflict within the Fu-Ma. Contacting Chie's rebellious faction, Taki faces the corrupted Toki as he absorbs the oni spirits sealed within the Hoko temple. She slays him and Chie becomes the new Fu-Ma leader, but the evil spirits that dwelled within Toki escape and travel west. Knowing they are seeking Soul Edge, and that its power has weakened, Taki begins a new journey to find and finally extinguish the evil sword. In Soulcalibur IV (2008), witnessing a cataclysm caused by a duel between Siegfried armed with Soul Calibur and Soul Edge-wielding Nightmare motivates her to destroy both of the Soul swords.Alex Jenkins, Soul Calibur 4 Character Spotlight: Taki  The voluptuous ninja works her magic once again, 1UP.com, July 28, 2008. Formerly, it has been announced that Taki would return in the sixth main installment, Soulcalibur V (2012)Michael McWhertor, Taki's 'Not Dead' and Ivy's All Grown Up in Soulcalibur V, Kotaku, July 25, 2011. set 17 years after the events of the previous game, wherein she was supposed to appear alongside her young, female disciple named Natsu.Grant Howitt, Soulcalibur V's Ninja Is Taki's Disciple, Siliconera, July 19, 2011.Michael McWhertor, Meet Soulcalibur V's New Ninja Girl, Kotaku, July 15, 2011. However, Taki herself did not appear in the game in person. Soon after the events of Soulcalibur IV, she has sealed the demon Arahabaki inside Natsu, an orphan baby adopted by Chie, following Taki's slaying of his previous human host.SoulCalibur: New Legends of Project Soul, page 123. Because this caused the girl to be ostracized by her peers, Taki took the responsibility to personally raise her so she may grow her confidence in herself. As explained in Natsu's backstory, Taki had traveled west to pursue rumors of Toki's return, promising that she would return in two weeks; she has not returned since, prompting the now-teenage Natsu to travel in search of her mentor. The game does not reveal whether Natsu finds her, but it was said that Taki would \\"eventually\\" return.バンダイナムコゲームスが格闘ゲームのセッションを開催、『鉄拳』や『ソウルキャリバーV』のサプライズ発表が続々【Comic‐Con International 2011】, Famitsu.com, July 24, 2011.

Taki has been officially described as \\"one of the most versatile fighters of the SOULCALIBUR universe\\" due to \\"her unarmed & armed skills, demon huntress abilities and blacksmithing abilities.\\" Soulcalibur II producer Hiroaki Yotoriyama spoke of his team being \\"proud\\" of Ivy and Taki as \\"these characters seem to live [...] as if it is real and they are really human.\\" Soulcalibur III director Katsutoshi Sasaki regarded Taki as his personal favorite character from the seriesSoul Calibur Director Katsutoshi Sasaki on Weapons, Characters and Storyline, Kotaku, September 20, 2007 and she was one of the first two returning characters confirmed for it. Some character design alt=Eight black and white pencil drawings of a young woman in fighting costumes and poses. As in the case of all Soul characters, Taki's character creation started with choosing the weapon. During the early development of Soul Edge, Taki was conceived as a Yoshimitsu-like ninja character, armed with a long sword and wearing a loose outfit and large helmet covering her upper face. She underwent several major design changes before the game's release, evolving into an athletic, iron- masked woman clad in a partially armored catsuit. Taki used variations of this outfit throughout the series; by default her primary costumes are colored crimson and sometimes navy blue, and usually she has long hair in a ponytail. Taki's outfits are generally supposed to give emphasis on ease of movement, due to her fighting style's emphasis on high leaping, tumbling and rolling. Her original weapon in Soul Edge is a kodachi, called , which she made by infusing it with mystical powers. This is her preferred weapon and is one of the few original weapons that have not been replaced in subsequent games. Her secondary weapon, the kodachi , formerly property of the deceased clan of the ninja Yoshimitsu (originally from Tekken), was added for her dual-wielding style in the first Soulcalibur as the lower blade on her back. The later games' character design was based around the characters' movement so their look would match it, which in Taki's case included using two swords, moving very fast, and having a specialized kicking moveset. In some of her costumes she different hair styles, and in some has no mask at all. A simple cloth version of the mask has been introduced with Taki's primary costume in Soulcalibur (the only game in which her breasts are partially exposed). In some of her outfits, since Soulcalibur III, she has an ornate, demon-themed menpō armored half mask covering the face from the nose down to the chin but exposing the mouth; other demonic motifs have appeared on her armor since Soulcalibur.Soul Calibur -- Digital Calibur, Soulcalibur official website, Namco Bandai Games Inc. Taki alternate costumes include one in Soulcalibur II that was modeled after that of Waya Hime from Bravoman. One of her especially varied attires for Soulcalibur: Lost Swords has been the limited-offer \\"SC Woman\\" that was created by Bayonetta's character designer Mari Shimazaki, inspired by American comic books superheroines. According to Japanese culture researcher Rachael Hutchinson, \\"although Taki is sheathed in fabric, it is so tight that the shape of her body is clearly visible, making her the only female character with visible nipples and pubis. Taki is arguably the most sexualized of all the female characters [in the series] in this respect, although her costume is very strong and powerful where the costumes of Sophitia, Xianghua and Seung Mi-na are softer and more fluid.\\" The game's producer Hisaharu Tago said of her appearance in Soulcalibur V, in which Taki is depicted as over 40, \\"In terms of her outfit, we don't know if she'll be in body tights.\\" Taki retained her skintight clothing with noticeable nipples (a noted trait of the character and of the series) in Soulcalibur VI, which goes back to the series' early timeline. Setsuka, introduced in Soulcalibur III, has a fighting style mixing these of Taki and Mitsurugi.Hyper issue 147 page 33. Soulcalibur Vs Natsu fights very similar to her master Taki, including using many of her signature moves Immediately after the release of Soulcalibur V in Japan, the game's director Daishi Odashima said that he had decided that at 46, Taki would be too old to be an active ninja, and she retired to train the next generation and is now watching over Natsu from the shadows.Justin Sevakis, Soulcalibur V Team Explains Why Natsu Replaced Taki, Anime News Network, January 31, 2012. In Namco's own 2016 fighting game Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, female ninja Master Raven is similar to Taki in many aspects, including her fighting technique, outfit and personality.  Gameplay  According to Adam Rosenberg from UGO in 2008, \\"Taki is a close-range fighter, end of story. She's blindingly fast, perhaps one of the most agile fighters in the series. The best way to play Taki then is to string combo\\" into combo without ever letting up.Adam Rosenberg, Top 11 SoulCalibur Fighters  We single out our favorite SoulCalibur Fighters , UGO.com, July 31, 2008. Official UK PlayStation Magazine recommended Taki and Li Long in Soul Edge as \\"probably best for the novice they can both offer a great range of kicks and attacks.\\"Official UK PlayStation Magazine Platinum Special page 87. Ultra Game Players noted her for speed and a variety of attacks, choosing her and Mitsurugi as the two most well-rounded characters in the game, and her alone as probably the best character, with \\"an attack for any given situation.\\"Ultra Game Players issue 95, pages 93-95. She was noted for being very dangerous in unarmed combat (after losing weapons) too, due to her many and powerful kick moves. According to Computer and Video Games (CVG) guide to Soul Edge, \\"lightning fast combos and close quarter combat\\" is what a Taki player has to master in the game: \\"Though she has little in terms of long range attacks, she has multi-height combinations that can be employ in close. A good choice for the competent player to move on to.\\" Similarly, James Price of DC-UK wrote that in Soulcalibur, the \\"fast and agile\\" Taki is capable of \\"swift and deadly attacks\\" as well as \\"of making somersaults over and around her opponents,\\" but at the cost of having a limited range.James Price, \\"Soulcalibur: The Complete Review\\", DC-UK (November 1999), page 14. According to Jesse Schedeen of IGN, the character's fighting style \\"improved dramatically\\" between Soul Edge and Soulcalibur due to being given dual swords to use at once. Taki has remained the quickest and most mobile character in Soulcalibur;Arcade issue 14 page 65.Dreamcast Player issue 1 page 58. as described by GameFan, \\"there is no character quicker and trickier (well, maybe Voldo has more tricks), than Taki. While her attacks don't do great damage, her quickness makes it easy to combo almost anything with her.\\" In Soulcalibur II, Taki was given more distance- closing moves to help compensate for her limited range.GMR issue 1 (February 2003) page 52. Nevertheless, the Soulcalibur II guide by GamePro verdicted Taki is an \\"excellent short range fighter with plenty of height variation in attack,\\" yet still \\"weak against good long range opponents\\" and with \\"poor offensive capabilities outside short range.\\"GamePro Australia issue 1 page 98. The game's review by Marlon Ramos of Philippine Daily Inquirer \\"of course\\" highly recommended Taki for the players who are \\"after speed\\".Marlon Ramos, Soul of a new fighting game, Philippine Daily Inquirer, April 28, 2003. In GameSpot's guide to Soulcalibur II, Stephen Kleckner wrote that Taki has \\"a lot of options and variety which allow her to really mix up her attack heights\\" and very quick moves making her highly capable at close range, but might \\"essentially become a moving target\\" if her player \\"can't rush down someone who is really good at sustaining a range game, such as Kilik.\\"Stephen Kleckner, Soul Calibur II Walkthrough, Page 18, GameSpot.com. Andrew Alfonso wrote in GameSpy's guide that \\"what makes Taki so fearsome is her speed. She's still the fastest character in the game, and despite this her damage potential is still very good at times. However, unlike the big power hitters like Cervantes and Astaroth, she needs to work for her wins.\\" Alfonso added that Taki can be \\"somewhat hard to learn and execute with\\" and the key strategy \\"is to maintain her flow of attack.\\"Andrew Alfonso (with contributions from Paul Oh and Zakk Jones), Soulcalibur II - cube - Walkthrough and Guide - Page 20, GameSpy. Taki and Talim, who are both the most acrobatic and fastest characters in the game, were noted to be particularly dangerous in the original version of the HD Online edition due to Internet multiplayer lag problems. Taki has been one of the four characters available in the pre- release demo version of Soulcalibur IV.Sid Shuman, Soul Calibur IV hands-on, GamePro, April 16, 2008. According to Alex Jenkins of 1UP.com, in this game Taki lost some of her prior advantages but is still an agile and fast character who can cause considerable damage and is meant to be played aggressively, as well as a strong counter-attacker. Her weaknesses include difficulties in playing against ranged-type characters and having many risky special moves. IGN's Schedeen wrote that, due to her \\"lightning-quick ninja reflexes,\\" Taki is \\"a vicious combatant that new and old players alike love to control.\\" According to the game's battle director, Taki is to be the fastest character of SCVI. In addition, her expanded magical possibilities are to make getting close to the enemy from a distance easier and her Rekkimaru to be able to hurt even to a blocking enemy. In the action-adventure game Soulcalibur Legends, Taki is the only character capable of performing a double jump (a video game character's ability to jump a second time in mid-air). In the now- defunct online spin-off Lost Swords, she had been originally announced as one of the only four are available in this game from the start (the others being Siegfried, Mitsurugi and Sophitia) but was actually one of unlockable characters in the released version.  Reception   Popularity and general acclaim  Since her introduction in 1995, Taki has been consistently one of the most popular characters in the Soul series, especially in the West, but also back home in Japan. For instance, Namco named Taki, Ivy and Nightmare as the three most popular Soulcalibur characters in North American markets in 2002. She was described as \\"a favorite of many\\" by Official Xbox Magazine (OXM),Official Xbox Magazine 13/2008, page 26. and as one of the series' most beloved characters by Brazil's SuperGamePower. UGO ranked Taki as sixth best Soulcalibur character in 2008. IGN's Schedeen ranked her as the series' fifth top fighter in 2008, writing \\"it's hard to imagine a Soulcalibur game without Taki. It just wouldn't be the same.\\" GameDaily's staff called her one of the most elite fighters in the Soul games,Babe of the Week: Asian Beauties, GameDaily, February 6, 2009. adding that she \\"has left an impact from the very start\\" of the series;Babes of the Week: Soul Calibur Hotties, GameDaily, October 5, 2007. according to them, \\"there are many women worth mentioning in the Soul Calibur series, but if anyone really knows how to handle Darth Vader, Yoda and the Apprentice, it's Taki.\\"The Next Wave of Video Game Babes, GameDaily, July 24, 2008. X360 chose her as the most iconic character of Soulcalibur II,X360 issue 20 page 16. while Complex placed Taki sixth in their 2013 ranking of the best characters in the series, calling her \\"an unstoppable force\\" and stating \\"We love Taki!\\" She was voted the series' second (behind Talim) most popular character among the Western audience in an official Facebook poll by Namco Bandai in 2015, which was to influence their future plans for the franchise. Some publications and authors have highly regarded Taki as one of the best female fighting game or even overall video game characters of them all for a variety of reasons. Reviewing Soulcalibur for the Dreamcast as the best fighting game he has ever played, Dave Halverson from Gamers' Republic wrote about being \\"elated\\" by its \\"work of art\\" character design of Taki, who \\"exhibits remarkable grace and agility, an almost spirit- like quality.\\" SuperGamePower chose her one of the 20 \\"muses of video games\\" in 2001 and GMR 2003 feature \\"The GREAT Women of Gaming\\" included Taki at fourth place.GMR issue 16 (5/2004) page 46. In 2004, play called included her and her and Ivy among \\"gaming's greatest females\\", further calling them \\"arguably the finest females in all of 3D fighting.\\" In 2007, Rob Wright of Tom's Games chose Taki as one of the 50 greatest female characters in video games, calling her \\"a skilled and noble warrior with a shining spirit and stunning beauty\\".Rob Wright, The 50 Greatest Female Characters in Video Game History, Tom's Games, 2007-02-20.

College career Jones was recruited out of East Allegheny high school to play for Johnny Majors and the University of Pittsburgh. The Pitt Panthers of the late 1970's were one of the top programs in the country and some of those players, besides Jones, that would go one to NFL careers include Tony Dorsett, and Matt Cavanaugh. In 1975, Jones played in 12 games, he caught 22 passes for 384 yards and four touchdown passes. That season, Pittsburgh finished ranked 15th in the national and defeated Kansas in the Sun Bowl. 1976 proved to be an odd year stats wise for Jones. He caught one less pass, but for one more yard and one more touchdown than he'd had the previous season. 1977 was a break out year for Jones. He finished 5th in the national with 45 receptions. His nine touchdown receptions also put him in the top ten in the nation, as he finished seventh. He also had four kick off returns for a touchdown, which put him at number one. He also played in the Gator Bowl, as Pittsburgh crushed Clemson 34-3. In Jones' senior year, he again caught 45 passes, this time for 666 yards and just three touchdown receptions.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/gordon-jones-1.html Pro career The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Jones in the second round on the 1979 NFL draft (34th player selected overall). Much of Jones' rookie season was spent on the bench, as he was buried on the depth chart by Morris Owens, Larry Mucker and Isaac Hagins, the team's seasons vets. Jones only started one game, and finished the season with four receptions for 80- yards and one touchdown. He played in the NFC Championship against the Los Angeles Rams, but did not catch a pass. The next season Tampa Bay overhauled their receiving core. Owens was let go, and rookie Kevin House took his place on the roster. Jones started in 14 games, caught 48 passes for 668 yards and five touchdowns, in what be his best season as a pro. With Kevin House emerging as the go to receiver for Tampa Bay, Jones settled into the role as the number two receiver. He started few games over the next two seasons, as Gerald Carter (acquired from the Jets) and Theo Bell, acquired from the Pittsburgh Steelers reduced Jones' workload. After the 1982 season, was finished, Jones moved on from Tampa Bay to play for the Rams. Jones caught 11 passes for 172 yards for the Rams, but the offense was centered around running back Eric Dickerson.https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JoneGo00.htm Post NFL career As of 2011, Gordon Jones had returned to the city of Tampa and worked as a physical therapist.https://www.cardiachill.com/2011/11/3/2529414/pitt-football-tony- dorsett-where-are-they-now-matt-cavanaugh References Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:American football wide receivers Category:Los Angeles Rams players Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:Pittsburgh Panthers football players Category:Players of American football from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from Buffalo, New York ","title":"Gordon Jones (American football)"},{"id":"21548390","text":"Malahide Cricket Club was founded in 1861 and is situated within Malahide Castle demesne, near the railway station.

He was nicknamed \\"The Vampire of Sacramento\\" because he drank his victims' blood and cannibalized their remains.  Early life  Chase was a native of Sacramento, California. By the age of 10, he exhibited evidence of all three parts of the Macdonald triad, an archaic theory suggesting the development of psychopathy. Criminal & Behavioral Profiling Curt R. Bartol, Anne M. Bartol, 2013, Sample Materials: Chapter 2: Crime Scene Profiling. SAGE Publications, IncChildhood firesetting, enuresis and cruelty to animals as cultural lore. Published on May 2, 2012 by Karen Franklin, Ph.D. In his adolescence, he was said to be a heavy drug user.  Early adulthood  Chase developed hypochondria as he matured. He often complained that his heart would occasionally \\"stop beating\\", or that \\"someone had stolen his pulmonary artery\\".Amanda Howard, Martin Smith: River of Blood, Universal Publishers (August 30, 2004), , pp. 82 accessed via Google Books He would hold oranges on his head, believing Vitamin C would be absorbed by his brain via diffusion. Chase also believed that his cranial bones had become separated and were moving around, so he shaved his head to be able to watch this activity. After leaving his mother's house (believing she was attempting to poison him), Chase rented an apartment with friends. Chase's roommates complained that he was constantly under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, and LSD. Chase would also walk around the apartment nude, even in front of company. Chase's roommates demanded that he move out. When he refused, the roommates moved out instead. Once alone in the apartment, Chase began to capture, kill, and disembowel various animals, which he would then devour raw, sometimes mixing the raw organs with Coca-Cola in a blender and drinking the concoction. Chase believed that by ingesting the creatures he was preventing his heart from shrinking.  Institutionalization  Chase spent a brief time in a psychiatric ward in 1973. In 1976, he was involuntarily committed to a mental institution upon being taken to a hospital after injecting rabbit's blood into his veins. The staff nicknamed him \\"Dracula\\" because of his blood fixation. He broke the necks of two birds he caught through the institution window and drank their blood. He also extracted blood from therapy dogs with stolen syringes. Chase was promptly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. After undergoing a battery of treatments involving psychotropic drugs, Chase was deemed no longer a danger to society; and, later in 1976, he was released to his mother's custody. Chase's mother weaned him off his medication and got him his own apartment. He initially shared the apartment with roommates before all of them moved out, thus leaving Chase on his own. Later investigation uncovered that, in mid-1977, Chase was stopped and arrested on a reservation in the Pyramid Lake (Nevada), area. His body was smeared with blood and a bucket of blood was found in his truck. The blood was determined to be cow's blood, and no charges were filed.  Murder spree  On December 29, 1977, Chase killed his first known victim in a drive-by shooting. The victim, Ambrose Griffin, was a 51-year-old engineer and father of two. He attempted to enter the home of a woman two weeks later, but because her doors were locked, he walked away. Chase later told detectives that he took locked doors as a sign that he was not welcome, but unlocked doors were an invitation to come inside. He was once caught and chased off by a couple returning home as he pilfered their belongings; he had also urinated and defecated on their infant child's bed and clothing. On January 23, 1978, Chase broke into a house and shot Teresa Wallin (three months pregnant at the time) three times. He then had sexual intercourse with her corpse while stabbing her with a butcher knife. He then removed multiple organs, cut off one of her nipples and drank her blood. He stuffed dog feces from Wallin's yard down her throat before leaving. On January 27, Chase entered the home of 38-year-old Evelyn Miroth. He encountered her friend, Danny Meredith, whom he shot with his .22 handgun, then took Meredith's wallet and car keys. He then fatally shot Miroth, her six-year-old son Jason, and her 22-month-old nephew David Ferreira, before mutilating Miroth and engaging in necrophilia and cannibalism with her corpse. A visitor's knock on the door startled Chase, who fled in Meredith's car, taking Ferreira's body with him. The visitor alerted a neighbor, who called police. They discovered that Chase had left perfect handprints and shoe imprints in Miroth's blood. Chase was arrested shortly afterwards - police who searched Chase's apartment found that the walls, floor, ceiling, refrigerator, and all of Chase's eating and drinking utensils were soaked in blood.  Aftermath  In 1979, Chase stood trial on six counts of murder. In order to avoid the death penalty, the defense tried to have him found guilty of second degree murder, which would result in a life sentence. Their case hinged on Chase's history of mental illness and the suggestion that his crimes were not premeditated. On May 8, 1979, the jury found Chase guilty of six counts of first degree murder and, rejecting the argument that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, sentenced him to die in the gas chamber. His fellow inmates, aware of the extremely violent nature of Chase's crimes, feared him, and according to prison officials, often tried to persuade Chase to commit suicide. Chase granted a series of interviews with Robert Ressler, during which he spoke of his fears of Nazis and UFOs, claiming that although he had killed, it was not his fault; he had been forced to kill to keep himself alive, which he believed any person would do. He asked Ressler to give him access to a radar gun, with which he could apprehend the Nazi UFOs, so that the Nazis could stand trial for the murders. He also handed Ressler a large amount of macaroni and cheese, which he had been hoarding in his pants pockets, believing that the prison officials were in league with the Nazis and attempting to kill him with poisoned food. On December 26, 1980, Chase was found in his cell, dead. An autopsy found that he committed suicide with an overdose of prescribed antidepressants that he had saved over several weeks.

MYLK4 is a member of the myosin light-chain kinase family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases that phosphorylate the regulatory light chain of myosin II. This protein acts as an enzyme that catalyzes the following reaction: ATP + a protein -> ADP + a phosphoprotein. MYLK4 is also involved in protein amino acid phosphorylation meaning that it adds a phosphate group onto the molecule. Not very much is known about the specific functional characteristics of MLYK4, but it has recently been found that the gene may possibly have a role in having at least one driver mutation for cancer. MYLK4 may also be involved in transferase activity, ATP binding, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, and also nucleotide binding.

Background  It is not known when Wu Shaoyang was born, but it is known that his family was from Cang Prefecture (滄州/沧州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). His father was named Wu Xiang (), and both his father and he served in the army of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), when he became friendly with another Weibo soldier, Wu Shaocheng.Wu Shaocheng's and Wu Shaoyang's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang appeared to imply an intimate relationship, but do not explicitly state so. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 145 and New Book of Tang, vol. 214. Sometime after Wu Shaocheng became military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhaoyi Circuit in 786,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. he sent gold and silk to Weibo Circuit, requesting that he be allowed to have Wu Shaoyang. Weibo allowed Wu Shaoyang to report to Zhangyi. Wu Shaocheng claimed that Wu Shaoyang was a cousin, and gave him various commissions; Wu Shaoyang was also given access to Wu Shaocheng's mansion. Still, because Wu Shaocheng was cruel and suspicious, Wu Shaoyang requested a position not at headquarters, and Wu Shaocheng made him the prefect of Shen Prefecture (申州, in modern Xinyang, Henan). It was said that because Wu Shaoyang was lenient, he became favored by the army.Old Book of Tang, vol. 145. When Wu Shaocheng grew ill in 809 and fell unconscious, his servant Xianyu Xiong'er (), forged an order in Wu Shaocheng's name recalling Wu Shaoyang to serve as deputy military governor. Wu Shaoyang put Wu Shaocheng's son Wu Yuanqing () to death and took over the circuit. After Wu Shaocheng died around the new year 810, Wu Shaoyang claimed the title of acting military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. As then-reigning Emperor Xianzong was already waging a campaign against another warlord, Wang Chengzong, who ruled Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), at the time, he felt that he could not act against Wu Shaoyang as well, so he made his son Li You the Prince of Sui the titular military governor of Zhaoyi and gave Wu Shaoyang the title of acting military governor in spring 810. In spring 811, Wu was made military governor.  As Jiedushi  It was said that during the years he was military governor, Wu Shaoyang did not pay homage to the emperor. As his territory had many plains and meadows, he cultivated husbandry of horses and mules. He often pillaged the hills of neighboring Shou Prefecture (壽州/寿州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), which were known for growing tea, to rob the tea merchants. He also often accepted those persons who were under prosecution by other circuits and put them into his army. However, as he often submitted tributes of horses to Emperor Xianzong, Emperor Xianzong did not act against him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Wu Shaoyang died in 814. His son Wu Yuanji initially did not announce his death and tried to obtain imperial sanction to succeed him. When Emperor Xianzong refused to grant him a commission, Wu Yuanji reacted by pillaging the surrounding circuits, and Emperor Xianzong declared a general campaign against him, eventually defeating and killing him.

While many of his big band assignments were as lead alto sax player, his favorite instrument was the clarinet.  Musical education  Born in Paterson, New Jersey, he began playing the clarinet at age 9, tutored by his brother Kermit. His first formal study on clarinet and sax was with Joe Allard, a prominent New York teacher. Later Levinsky attended the Music Conservatory at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pennsylvania where he majored in clarinet. He was an 'A' student and the college woodwind instructor, Frank Stachow, once said to him: \\"You're the most talented musician that ever came to this school.\\" His secondary instruments were alto saxophone and flute, and of course, he was required to learn keyboard while at music school.  Musical career  Levinsky first assignment with a 'name' band was with the Les Elgart orchestra. Then, as a full-time professional, he replaced Buddy DeFranco in the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra which toured in the US and Cuba. During the Korean war he enlisted in the US Air Force and served as a musician and member of the Airmen of Note of the U. S. Air Force band. After his Air Force discharge in 1954 Levinsky wanted to avoid the disruptive life of a band member on the road and settled in the New York area. Back with the Tommy Dorsey band for a brief stint, he then landed a job as reed player on a Broadway show. That was the beginning of a period when he worked as an instrumentalist in various show orchestras and also backed recording artists as a studio session musician. In 1956 when Benny Goodman was assembling a new band for an engagement at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, he selected Levinsky as his lead sax player. While with the Goodman band, Levinsky was nominated by Benny as his backup player for the clarinet solos. When that engagement closed, Levinsky signed on for a summer contract with the Goodman band playing concerts in other cities. Levinsky then joined the NBC Staff Orchestra. During this period he recorded an RCA album with the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra playing Benny Goodman's clarinet solos. While at NBC, he took various freelance assignments and also contracted to the CBS Staff band. In 1962, he graduated to The Tonight Show Band, led by Skitch Henderson (later headed by Doc Severinsen) backing The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After leaving NBC in the late 60's, Levinsky joined MBA Music, a small New York company that produced music for commercials. This gave him the chance to move into composing, arranging and conducting. He composed, scored and conducted music for many NBC films. In the summer of 1968 he was offered the job of clarinet soloist for the re-created Artie Shaw band. Artie Shaw conducted the sessions and requested Levinsky to play his original solos note-for-note (see discography below). During these New York years he worked and recorded with many 'name' artists such as Tony Bennett, Stan Getz, Lena Horne, Gerry Mulligan, Doc Severinsen, Frank Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan. As a freelance music director he also worked and toured with other well known artists like Nina van Pallandt (of Nina & Frederik), and actor and entertainer Richard Harris. He also composed for Score Productions, a well-known production company specializing in TV music. Levinsky is credited on a 1976 album of music cues for The Price is Right, which includes much of the show's music that is still heard today such as the showcase showdown and various car cues. One of those cues, a Nashville Brass-style country music piece, became the theme to Family Feud. The 1990s brought further success with a busy concert and touring schedule as bandleader and clarinet soloist with his Great American Swing Band. Levinsky died in Sarasota, Florida, aged 70, from a brain tumour.

Pre-1970 In 1948 and 1950, ABC televised the National Football League Championship Game. Harry Wismer provided commentary for the game in 1948 game and the game in 1955 joined by Red Grange and Joe Hasel. Since the game was played in Los Angeles, there was no network telecast of the 1951 NFL Championship Game because at that time there was no way to send live TV programs from the West Coast to the East Coast and vice versa. ABC first broadcast regular season National Football League games in 1953. At the time, they only broadcast Chicago Bears home games and Chicago Cardinals home games. Beginning in 1954, ABC added Washington Redskins home games. In ABC's final year of their initial go around with the National Football League, they added Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers games (for the Pacific Time Zone affiliates) to go along with their coverage of the Bears and Cardinals. Wire accounts found in newspaperarchive.com indicated that the Washington-Philadelphia game in Week 2 of the 1953 season, was to have been regionally televised by ABC, but the cables needed for the telecast never arrived. The articles said that NFL Commissioner Bert Bell was \\"fuming\\" over the incident. For the Chicago-based games, ABC used Red Grange and Bill Fay on commentary. When ABC added the Redskins to their schedule in 1954, they used Bob Wolff and Dutch Bergman. For games featuring the 49ers and the Rams in 1955, ABC used Bob Kelley plus Bill Brundige on the Rams telecast. Bob Fouts and Frankie Albert were on the commentary for 49ers games. Although for the first two weeks of the 1955 season, the roles were reversed. In the event that the 49ers were in Chicago to play the Bears (which occurred in Week 3 of the 1955 season on October 8), then ABC would use Red Grange and Bill Fay. However, on November 13 (Week 8 of the 1955 season), when the Rams traveled to Chicago to face the Bears, ABC employed a split-commentary concept with Bob Kelley and Bill Brundige calling the game for viewers in Pacific areas and Red Grange and Bill Fay calling the game for viewers in the Midwest. If the 49ers were in Los Angeles to play the Rams (like in Week 7 of the 1955 season), then they used Bob Fouts and Frankie Albert. ABC's relationship with the NFL at this point pretty much ended when CBS began carrying regular season games across its network nationwide in 1956. This came off the heels of the NFL's previous principal network TV partner, the DuMont Network suspending its operations. Less than five years later however, ABC became the initial network television partner for the American Football League. The deal called for ABC to broadcast approximately 37 regular season games, the AFL Championship Game and the AFL All-Star Game. These games were typically broadcast regionally on 15 consecutive Sundays and on Thanksgiving Day. This became the first ever cooperative television plan for professional football, in which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs; the National Football League would follow suit in 1961, a move that required Congress to pass the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 to accommodate such collective broadcasting contracts. Monday night National Football League games prior to 1970 During the early 1960s, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during prime time that could be viewed by a greater television audience (while the NFL had scheduled Saturday night games on the DuMont Television Network in 1953 and 1954, poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time CBS took over the rights in 1956). An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games. Undaunted, Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night, scheduling the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions for a game on September 28, 1964. While the game was not televised, it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to Tiger Stadium, the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in Detroit up to that point. Two years later, Rozelle would build on this success as the NFL began a four-year experiment of playing on Monday night, scheduling one game in prime time on CBS during the 1966 and 1967 seasons, and two contests during each of the next two years. NBC followed suit in 1968 and 1969 with games involving American Football League teams. Negotiations with ABC During subsequent negotiations on a new television contract that would begin in 1970 (coinciding with the completion of a merger between the NFL and AFL), Rozelle concentrated on signing a weekly Monday night deal with one of the three major networks. After sensing reluctance from both NBC and CBS in disturbing their regular programming schedules, Rozelle spoke with ABC. Despite the network's status at the time as the lowest-rated of the three major broadcast networks, ABC was also reluctant to enter the risky venture. It was only after Rozelle used the threat of signing a deal with the independent Hughes Sports Network, an entity bankrolled by reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, did ABC sign a contract for the scheduled games. Speculation was that had Rozelle signed with Hughes, many ABC affiliates would have pre-empted the network's Monday lineup in favor of the games, severely damaging potential ratings. After the final contract for Monday Night Football was signed, ABC Sports producer Roone Arledge immediately saw possibilities for the new program. Setting out to create an entertainment \\"spectacle\\" as much as a simple sports broadcast, Arledge hired Chet Forte, who would serve as director of the program for over 22 years. Arledge also ordered twice the usual number of cameras to cover the game, expanded the regular two-man broadcasting booth to three, and used extensive graphic design within the show as well as instant replay. 1970–1985: Founding era Prior to 1978, Monday night games were not scheduled in the final week (Week 14) of the regular season. From 1974 to 1977, a Saturday night game was scheduled for Week 14 and televised live by ABC in lieu of a game on Monday night. Cosell, Jackson, and Meredith Looking for a lightning rod to garner attention, Arledge hired controversial New York City sportscaster Howard Cosell as a commentator, along with veteran football play-by-play announcer Keith Jackson. Arledge had tried to draw in Curt Gowdy and then Vin Scully to ABC for the MNF play-by-play role, but settled for Jackson after they proved unable to break their respective existing contracts with NBC Sports and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Jack Buck was also considered, but when Arledge assistant Chuck Howard telephoned Buck with the job offer, Buck refused to respond due to anger at his treatment by ABC during an earlier stint with the network. Arledge's original choice for the third member of the trio, Frank Gifford, was unavailable since he was still under contract to CBS Sports. However, Gifford suggested former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith, setting the stage for years of fireworks between the often-pompous Cosell and the laid-back Meredith. Monday Night Football first aired on ABC on September 21, 1970, with a game between the New York Jets and the Browns in Cleveland. Advertisers were charged US$65,000 per minute by ABC during the clash, a cost that proved to be a bargain when the contest collected 33% of the viewing audience. The Browns defeated the Jets, 31–21 in a game which featured a 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by the Browns' Homer Jones to open the second half, and was punctuated when Billy Andrews intercepted Joe Namath late in the fourth quarter and returned it 25 yards for the clinching touchdown. However, Cleveland viewers saw different programming on WEWS-TV, because of the NFL's blackout rules of the time (this would apply for all games through the end of the 1972 season; beginning in 1973, home games could be televised if tickets were sold out 72 hours before kickoff). One of the trademarks of Monday Night Football is a music cue used during the opening teasers of each program, a Johnny Pearson-composition titled \\"Heavy Action\\", originally a KPM production library cue (and also used as the theme music for the BBC program Superstars), which MNF began using in 1975. That success would continue over the course of the season, helping establish a phenomenon on Monday nights in the fall: movie attendance dropped, bowling leagues shifted to Tuesday nights and a Seattle hospital established an unwritten rule of no births during games. Cosell's presence initially caused Henry Ford II, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, the program's main sponsor, to ask for his removal. ABC refused, and Ford had a change of heart once the show's ratings were made public. Cosell dodged another controversy when he appeared to be intoxicated on-air during the November 23 game between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. Already ill, Cosell drank at a promotional party prior to the game, then ended up vomiting on Don Meredith's cowboy boots near the end of the first half. Jackson and Meredith ended up announcing the rest of the contest. Cosell, Gifford, and Meredith In 1971, Frank Gifford became available after his contract with CBS Sports expired; Arledge brought him to ABC to serve as play- by-play announcer, replacing Jackson (who returned to broadcasting college football for the network, which he continued to do for the next 35 seasons). The former New York Giant had been an NFL analyst for CBS during the 1960s but had never called play-by-play prior to joining Monday Night Football. In that capacity for Monday Night Football from 1971 to 1985, Gifford was often criticized for his see-no-evil approach in regard to discussing the NFL, earning him the dubious nickname \\"Faultless Frank.\\" Regardless, Gifford would have the longest tenure of any broadcaster on the show, lasting until 1998. Cosell's abrasive personality gave him enough recognition to host a live variety show on ABC in the fall of 1975. That show is remembered today only as a trivia question, as its title, Saturday Night Live, prevented a new late- night sketch comedy program on NBC from using that title until the ABC show was canceled. That seeming popularity was in contrast to the repeated criticisms in the media, as well as bar room contests in which winners were allowed to throw a brick through a television image of Cosell. After beginning with critical acclaim, Meredith began to take his weekly assignments less seriously, while also beginning an acting career. By 1973, his motivation for the broadcasts seemed highly suspect, given incidents during a trio of contests. On October 29, Meredith was drinking during the Buffalo Bills-Kansas City Chiefs game, which was preceded one week earlier by his pre-game analysis of the Denver Broncos-Oakland Raiders game: \\"We're in the Mile High City and I sure am\\" – a not-so-subtle reference to his use of marijuana at the time. Finally, during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Washington Redskins game on November 5, he referred to U.S. President Richard Nixon as \\"Tricky Dick\\". Cosell, Gifford, Williamson, and Karras Don Meredith would be absent from Monday Night Football for a broadcasting and acting career on rival NBC from 1974 to 1976. Fred Williamson, a former Kansas City Chiefs defensive back nicknamed \\"The Hammer\\" for his often-brutal hits, was selected by ABC to replace Meredith in 1974, but following a few pre-season broadcasts, proved so inarticulate that he was relieved of his duties prior to the start of the regular season, becoming the first MNF personality not to last an entire season (much less no part of the regular season at all). Williamson was replaced by fellow Gary, Indiana native Alex Karras, formerly of the Detroit Lions. The highlight of Williamson's MNF career was probably at the introductory press conference where he quipped that he was hired to \\"bring some color to the booth.\\" Karras made his debut on September 16, 1974 and immediately made an impact when he jokingly referred to Oakland Raiders' defensive lineman Otis Sistrunk as having attended \\"The University of Mars.\\" That would essentially be the high point of Karras' three-year tenure, with a developing movie career often distracting him from showing any improvement (in reality, Sistrunk did not attend any college but enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after high school and played semi-professional football before getting a tryout with the Raiders; the Raiders team guide listed his college alma mater as \\"U.S. Mars\\"). Cosell, Gifford, Meredith, and Tarkenton Meredith returned to the ABC booth in 1977, but seemed to lack the enthusiasm that had marked his first stint from 1970 to 1973. While the NFL moved to a 16-week schedule in 1978, Meredith was contractually obligated to work only 14 games, leaving Cosell and Gifford to work games as a duo or with newly retired Fran Tarkenton beginning in 1979. From 1977 to 1986, ABC also aired occasional NFL games on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday nights. Each of these telecasts would be billed by the network as a \\"Special Thursday/Saturday/Sunday Night Edition of Monday Night Football\\". One of the more somber contests in the run of the series came on November 27, 1978 when the San Francisco 49ers hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers. Earlier in the day, San Francisco mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk had been murdered at City Hall. Despite the complaints that followed, the NFL chose to play the game, a decision that mirrored the league's decision to play its scheduled games during the weekend following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 15 years earlier. The opening contest of the 1979 season saw a poignant moment as former New England Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley was introduced to a sellout crowd at the Patriots' Schaefer Stadium. Stingley had been paralyzed in a preseason game the year before and was making his first visit to the stadium since the accident. 1980 During the 1980 season, Monday Night Football continued its tradition of featuring notable guests during the half- time show, from a variety of different industries and backgrounds. During a Thursday Night Football special in Houston, 2 days after Ronald Reagan was elected to the White House, Vice-President elect George H.W. Bush was interviewed in the broadcast booth at halftime. Prior to the election, none of the candidates were invited on the program due to equal time regulations governing appearances during campaigns. Later that same season in Southern California, movie star Bo Derek, well known for her role in the movie \\"Ten\\", was the half-time guest and was interviewed by Howard Cosell. Some of the production crew teasingly referred to the segment as \\"The Beauty and the Beast\\". 1980 also marked some key personnel moves for the top-rated ABC show. It was the first season of Monday Night Football produced by Bob Goodrich, who would lead the production team for another 6 years. In addition, 1980 was the first year a woman joined the traveling production crew of over 40 cameramen, engineers, producers and directors. Alexis Denny, then a sophomore at Yale University, served as the stage manager of the telecasts and wrote the script for the half-time highlights that Howard Cosell would voice over in a style for which he was known throughout his career. =John Lennon tragedy= One of the most remembered moments in Monday Night Football history occurred on December 8, 1980, yet had nothing to do with the game or football in general. During a game between the Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots, Howard Cosell broke the news that former Beatle John Lennon had been shot and killed, news that stunned a nationwide audience. In 1974, Lennon had appeared in the Monday Night Football broadcast booth and was briefly interviewed by Cosell. 1982 contract renewal The NFL's television contract renewal in 1982 also put ABC in the Super Bowl rotation for the first time, giving it the broadcast rights to Super Bowl XIX in 1985. A second renewal of the television contract gave them the rights to Super Bowl XXII in 1988. From 1983 to 1986, ABC also aired a Friday night game in the final week (Week 16) of the regular season, in addition to the normal Monday night game. Cosell, Gifford, Meredith, and Simpson Cosell continued to draw criticism during Monday Night Football with one of his offhand comments during the September 5, 1983 game, igniting a controversy and laying the groundwork for his departure at the end of that season. In a game between the Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys, Cosell referred to Alvin Garrett, an African American wide receiver for the Redskins, as a \\"little monkey.\\" Cosell noted that Garrett's small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his grandchildren. Later, a special on Howard Cosell showed him calling Mike Adamle (a white player) a \\"little monkey.\\" Stung by the unrelenting barrage of remarks, Cosell claimed upon his departure from Monday Night Football that the NFL had become \\"a stagnant bore.\\" In Cosell's book, I Never Played the Game, he devoted an entire chapter (\\"Monkey Business\\") to the Garrett episode. In the book, Cosell also said that ABC should have had the right to choose its own Monday Night schedule. In his mind, Monday Night Football is what elevated the NFL in popularity over Major League Baseball. He felt that this should have been ABC's reward for raising the league's profile. That same year, O. J. Simpson replaced Tarkenton as a fill-in when Meredith or Cosell, who also was a broadcaster for the network's coverage of the Major League Baseball playoffs, was unavailable. The season would serve as a study in contrasts as one of the most exciting Monday night games ever was followed the next week by one of the most badly played in the run of the series. On October 17, 1983, the second highest scoring game in Monday Night Football history took place in the Green Bay Packers-Washington Redskins game, with the Packers winning the game by a score of 48–47. One week later, the New York Giants and St. Louis Cardinals played for more than four hours before settling for a 20–20 overtime tie, MNFs only OT tie to date. The deadlock had come after dropped touchdown passes by Cardinal wide receivers Willard Harrell and Roy Green, and a trio of missed field goals by teammate Neil O'Donoghue, including two in the final 63 seconds of the overtime period. Gifford, Meredith, and Simpson When Cosell left prior to the start of the 1984 season, the trio of Gifford, Meredith and Simpson handled the duties. Cosell's departure seemed to have the greatest effect on Meredith, who many believed to be a poor analyst in his absence. Falling ratings also gave indications that much of the mystique that surrounded the weekly event had disappeared. Gifford, Simpson, and Namath After the 1984 season, ABC replaced Meredith with Joe Namath the following year, with the quarterback making his debut in the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. In a coincidental twist, both Namath and Simpson were busy prior to the telecast with their induction into the shrine. One of the more grisly moments in Monday Night Football history occurred during a game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants on November 18, 1985, at RFK Stadium. Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann's career would end when Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor reached from behind to drag him down and Taylor fell heavily on the quarterback's leg in the process. On the play, which viewers could see in a gruesome slow-motion replay, Theismann suffered a compound fracture of the tibia and fibula in his lower right leg. The injury ended the playing career of Theismann, who had teamed with Gifford and Meredith on ABC's coverage of Super Bowl XIX in January 1985. Two weeks after that painful memory, the program's most watched contest took place as the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears were defeated by the Miami Dolphins, who had not lost to a National Football Conference (NFC) team at home since 1976. That would turn out to be Chicago's only loss in 1985. The game broadcast earned a Nielsen rating of 29.6 with a 46 share. 1986–2005: Al Michaels era Both Namath and Simpson would be replaced at the end of the 1985 NFL season, with critics noting their lack of journalistic skills in comparison to Cosell. In their place the following year came veteran broadcaster Al Michaels, who had previously anchored ABC's pregame coverage of Super Bowl XIX, and had been the lead play-by-play announcer of Monday Night Baseball since 1983. Michaels had also by this point, gained much acclaim at ABC for his 1980 \\"Miracle on Ice\\" broadcast. Gifford and Michaels Michaels served as the play-by-play announcer, teaming with Gifford for a two- man booth in 1986. During that season, the Miami Dolphins again made records with the biggest blowout in Monday Night Football history in a 45–3 rout of the then 10-1 New York Jets (the record was later tied and subsequently broken in 2005; see below). Also in 1986, when Al Michaels became unavailable because he was calling Major League Baseball's League Championship Series, Frank Gifford moved up into the play-by-play spot while Lynn Swann or O.J. Simpson filled-in as the color commentator. Gifford would once again call the play-by- play when Michaels was busy calling the World Series in 1987 and 1989 and the National League Championship Series in 1988. Gifford, Michaels, and Dierdorf In 1987, Gifford and Michaels were joined by Dan Dierdorf, returning the series to its original concept of three announcers in the booth. The trio would last for 11 seasons through the conclusion of the 1997 season. In 1989, television composer Edd Kalehoff created a new arrangement of Johnny Pearson's \\"Heavy Action\\", by that time fully synonymous with the series. This more or less replaced an original composition by Charles Fox. Also debuting in 1989 was Hank Williams, Jr. performing \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night\\", sung to the music of his 1984 hit \\"All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight.\\" =1989 contract renewal= As part of the league's television contract renewal with the network in 1989, ABC was awarded the television rights to Super Bowl XXV and Super Bowl XXIX, and the first round of NFL playoffs. The Monday Night Football announcing team anchored the telecasts, except for the first of two Wild Card Playoff games, in which ESPN's Sunday Night NFL crew of Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann presided over that telecast. However, the original crew for one of the two Wild Card Playoff games from 1990 to 1995 consisted of Brent Musburger and Dick Vermeil (both of whom did college football broadcasts for ABC during those two seasons). From 1990 until 2005, ABC's MNF television package included seventeen (eighteen in 1992 and 1993) regular season games (from 2003 until 2005, a Thursday game and 16 Mondays – no game on Week 17 because of playoff preparation disadvantages), the first two wild card playoff games (held on the first Saturday of the playoffs), and at times, the AFC–NFC Pro Bowl. =1994= The October 17, 1994 episode between the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos featured a duel between two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Joe Montana and John Elway. With 1:29 left to play in the game, Elway scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to put the Broncos ahead 28–24. But then Montana led the Chiefs on a 75-yard drive to score the game-winning touchdown with just 8 seconds to play. The final score was Chiefs 31, Broncos 28. The October 31, 1994 game between the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears is notable for a very windy/rainy game, which also featured the Crypt Keeper deliver the famous phase, and also remembered with a 36-yard TD run by Brett Favre, who had a sore hip that night. Later dubbed the Halloween Monsoon by Bear fans, the Packers crushed the Bears, 33–6. =1995= In the 1995 MNF regular season opener between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Giants at the New Jersey Meadowlands, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones controversially brought Nike chairman Phil Knight down to the sidelines, representing Jones' individual deal with Nike, contrary to the NFL's policy at the time of negotiating its marketing deals as a league (it wasn't until 2002 that the league's first league-wide uniform contract with Reebok was made; Nike would replace Reebok in that capacity in 2012). =1997= In 1997, ABC began using a scoring bug showing the game clock and score throughout the entire broadcast. Michaels, Dierdorf, and Esiason In 1998, Lesley Visser became the first female commentator on Monday Night Football. She had been the first female beat writer in the NFL when she covered the New England Patriots for the Boston Globe in the mid-1970s, and was the first and only woman to handle a Super Bowl Trophy presentation when she was a sportscaster with CBS. Visser was followed by several women, notably Melissa Stark and Lisa Guerrero, on the sideline who were perceived as \\"eye candy\\", none of whom affected the ratings. For the 1998 season, ABC pushed Monday Night Football back an hour (it has usually aired at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time). A special pre-game show was created, Monday Night Blast, hosted by Chris Berman from the ESPN Zone restaurant in Baltimore. The game would start around 8:20 p.m. Eastern for this particular season. Despite leaving the booth, Frank Gifford stayed on one more year as a special contributor to the pre-game show, usually presenting a single segment. A mildly infamous incident came during the final 1998 telecast when Dierdorf asked Michaels, prior to a halftime interview with Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, \\"Are you gonna tell 'em how you're sick of all this B.C. [Boston College] stuff?\\" Michaels (thinking that they had gone into a commercial break and that his microphone was off) replied, \\"No shit.\\" Nielsen ratings data for the first 17 weeks of the 1998–99 television season showed that Monday Night Football averaged a 13.9 rating, down 8% from the 15.0 average rating for the broadcasts in 1997 – the previous standard in ratings futility. In actuality, MNF ratings had been hitting all-time record lows for the previous four years. Michaels and Esiason Beginning in 1999, Monday Night Football telecasts used a computer-generated yellow line to mark where a team needs to get a first down, a method first used by ABC sister cable channel ESPN. 1999 also saw the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game being moved from Saturday afternoon to Monday night. It would remain on Monday night through 2005. Boomer Esiason replaced Gifford in 1998, and Dierdorf left for a return to CBS in 1999. Esiason's relationship with Michaels was questioned leading to his firing. Esiason and Michaels reportedly never got along, and it led to ABC firing Esiason shortly after calling Super Bowl XXXIV together. Michaels, Fouts, and Miller =2000= Unexpectedly, comedian Dennis Miller joined the cast in 2000, along with Dan Fouts. The move was ultimately regarded as a bust by many viewers and commentators. ABC briefly considered adding radio personality Rush Limbaugh before Miller was added to the broadcast team, despite having no prior sports broadcast experience (Limbaugh would instead be assigned as a commentator to Sunday NFL Countdown on ABC sister ESPN). Miller demonstrated a knowledge of the game and its personalities, although at times he tended to lapse into sometimes obscure analogy-riddled streams of consciousness similar to the \\"rants\\" of his standup comedy act. ABC even set up a webpage dedicated to explaining Miller's sometimes obscure pop culture references. Soon, it would become apparent that Miller's comedy did not mix with football. In June 2000, Lesley Visser's career suffered a highly publicized setback when she was famously bounced as the Monday Night Football sideline reporter for a less experienced, much younger woman and a man, who did not have as extensive journalistic credentials as Visser. \\"It was staggering to me\\", Visser later recalled. However, she wound up returning to CBS Sports, philosophical as ever. \\"You can have a short career if it's based on looks and youth\\", she said, \\"but legitimacy is what lasts.\\" Which ABC replaced her with both Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson. This was part of the overhaul when ABC brought back Don Ohlmeyer to serve as producer, who installed Dennis Miller as an analyst (for ultimately two unsuccessful seasons). She sued ABC Sports for age discrimination, with Howard Katz and Ohlmeyer being named as co-defendants. As previously mentioned, in 2000, Don Ohlmeyer, the program's producer up until 1977 was brought back. After spending time at NBC, Ohlmeyer was lured out of retirement to spark interest and provide some vigor to the broadcast. Besides the on-air talent, Ohlmeyer's changes included clips of players introducing themselves, new graphics and music. In another rather irreverent move, the scoring bug began incorporating nicknames for the teams, such as \\"Skins\\" and \\"Fins\\" (for the Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins) instead of their respective common abbreviations, WSH and MIA. On October 23, 2000, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins competed in what is now known as The Monday Night Miracle. Trailing 30–7 in the fourth quarter, Vinny Testaverde led the Jets to score 23 consecutive points to tie the game. After Miami scored another touchdown, Testaverde threw to offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott to tie the game at 37-all. At 1:08 a.m. Eastern Time, the game having crossed into Tuesday morning, John Hall kicked a field goal in overtime to win the game 40–37. It was the second biggest fourth quarter comeback in NFL history and biggest comeback in Jets' history. Arnold Schwarzenegger predicted the comeback at halftime, where he was appearing with the MNF crew to promote his upcoming movie, The 6th Day. With the Jets already down by 20 points he said, \\"Wayne Chrebet will catch a pass and the Jets will win. They're a great team.\\" =2001= The 2001 season of MNF featured a season-long campaign promoting the anticipated 20,000th point scored in MNF history. Denver Broncos kicker Jason Elam completed the task with a field goal during a 38–28 loss at Oakland on November 5. The three points also put Elam over 1,000 points for his career. In addition, the scoring bug reverted to using the team abbreviations, as opposed to the nickname scheme used in the previous season. Michaels and Madden In 2002, both Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts were dropped and John Madden joined Al Michaels in a two-man booth. Madden was a coach for the Oakland Raiders, namesake of the seminal Madden NFL video game series, and a successful broadcaster for 21 years – first with CBS until 1993 and then with Fox – before joining Monday Night Football. =2002= In 2002, the broadcast debuted the \\"Horse Trailer\\" award, in which a picture of the game's top performer(s) is displayed, as chosen by the broadcasting crew. During the fourth quarter of a preseason game early that season, Madden was joking about doing some recording in the \\"Horse Trailer\\", a term the producers used for one of the ABC production trucks. It was, in fact, a custom-built trailer designed from the shell of a horse trailer, but housed sophisticated electronic equipment inside it. By the first week of the regular season, an idea to decorate the plain white trailer with MNF decor, the entire MNF schedule, and a weekly MVP, was born. Immediately following each game, the winner(s) is chosen, and his picture is affixed to the trailer in the corresponding location. When Madden and Michaels went to NBC in 2006, they debuted a similar feature, the Rock Star – in which the photo of the player of the game was attached to the top of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City (the \\"Horse Trailer\\" concept was reinstated for the 2007 season). In addition to Fouts and Madden helming the regular season broadcasts, Brent Musburger and Gary Danielson served as commentators for that year's AFC Wild Card game, with Jack Arute serving as the sideline reporter. After suffering through several years of dismal Pro Bowl ratings, ABC considered moving the game to Monday night. In February 2003, Madden declined to serve as color commentator for the game in Hawaii, citing his fear of flying; former MNF personality Dan Fouts took his place. The Pro Bowl held the following year was played on a Sunday as typical, but was moved to ABC's sister network ESPN. =2003= In 2003, ABC and the NFL dropped the Monday Night Football game for the final week of the regular season. The move, which had been in effect for the first eight years of the broadcast (1970–1977), was the result of declining ratings, as well as problems involved for potential playoff teams, as there was a potential of only four days rest between their final regular season game and first-round playoff game. ABC replaced the telecast with an opening weekend Thursday night game, and in exchange ESPN got a Saturday night game on the final weekend. Also during the 2003 season, Lisa Guerrero decided to leave Fox Sports Net's The Best Damn Sports Show Period to join the MNF television crew as a sideline reporter (replacing the pregnant Melissa Stark). Guerrero's performance on the broadcast was heavily criticized, and the following year (also in an apparent move away from the \\"eye candy\\" concept) ABC replaced her with longtime TV sports journalist Michele Tafoya. Guerrero defended herself by saying that the show hired her with the intention of going in a totally different direction with the job of sideline reporter – personality-driven and feature-driven – then discarded all of that and told her to just do the job in the usual fashion. She said that she never would have taken the job if she had known that they would change their minds like that. In 2005, Michele Tafoya sat out much of the season while on maternity leave, with Sam Ryan temporarily taking her place. During the October 6, 2003 game between the Indianapolis Colts and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Indianapolis was trailing 35–14 with 3:43 remaining. The Colts had returned a Tampa Bay kickoff 90 yard to the 11-yard line, setting up a quick score. The Colts recovered an onside kick and scored again to narrow the margin to 35–28. They forced a Bucs punt and with less than two minutes remaining, Peyton Manning led an 87-yard drive to score the game-tying touchdown with 35 seconds left in regulation. In overtime, kicker Mike Vanderjagt missed a 40-yard field goal, but Simeon Rice was called for a leaping penalty, a rarely seen unsportsmanlike conduct infraction that penalizes a player for running and jumping to block a kick and landing on other players. Vanderjagt's subsequent kick was batted and hit the upright, but fell in good, winning the game for the Colts. Vanderjagt went on to become the second kicker in NFL history not to miss either a field goal or extra point in a single season after Gary Anderson, who accomplished the feat in the 1998 season as a member of the Minnesota Vikings. Vanderjagt did not miss a kick in the playoffs either, making him the first kicker to accomplish that feat (Anderson missed a field goal in the 1998-99 NFC Championship Game). On December 22, 2003, Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre put on one of the most defining moments of his career (while also ranking among his greatest game ever). The day before the contest against the Oakland Raiders, his father, Irvin, died suddenly of a heart attack. Favre elected to play, passing for four touchdowns in the first half, and 399 yards for the game in a 41–7 destruction of the Raiders (receiving applause from the highly partisan \\"Raider Nation\\"). Afterwards, Brett said, =2004= On November 15, 2004, controversy shrouded Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Terrell Owens when he appeared with actress Nicollette Sheridan (one of the stars of the new hit ABC comedy-drama Desperate Housewives) in an introductory skit which opened that evening's MNF telecast, in which Owens and the Eagles played the Cowboys at Texas Stadium. The skit was widely condemned as being sexually suggestive (see video) and ABC was forced to apologize for airing it (the Eagles went on to win the game, 49–21, with Owens catching three touchdown passes). However, on March 14, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the skit did not violate decency standards, because it contained no outright nudity or foul language. Originally, John Madden was supposed to appear in the commercial. =2005= For the 2005 season, which would become the network's final season as the MNF broadcaster and used through Super Bowl XL, ABC converted its scoring bug into a horizontal time-score banner placed across the bottom of the screen. \\"Monday Night Massacre\\" (Seahawks) On December 5, 2005, in a game dubbed \\"The Monday Night Massacre\\" by NFL Films, the Seattle Seahawks shut out the Philadelphia Eagles 42–0 with three defensive touchdowns (two interceptions, one fumble return). This tied the then-largest margin of victory mark in Monday Night Football history and set the mark for the greatest margin of victory in a Monday night shutout. This also set the NFL record for scoring the most points with less than 200 yards of offense. Andre Dyson scored twice for the Seahawks defense, once on a 72-yard interception return and the other on a 25-yard fumble return, earning himself the \\"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\\" as well as NFC defensive player of the week. A fourth interception return by Michael Boulware fell just short of tying another Seahawks NFL record of four defensive scores in a single game, set during a 45–0 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in 1984. The defeat was the Eagles third-worst in team history, tied for the worst loss in Monday Night history, and was the worst shutout loss. This was due to the Eagles' major injuries such as star quarterback Donovan McNabb (who was hurt in a Week 10 loss to the Cowboys) and the after-effects of the Terrell Owens saga earlier that year. The Eagles also lost their star running back Brian Westbrook due to an injury in this game. End of the ABC era Despite high ratings, ABC lost millions of dollars on televising the games during the late 1990s and 2000s. The NFL also indicated that it wanted Sunday night to be the new night for its marquee game, because more people tend to watch television on Sundays, and games held on that night would be more conducive to flexible scheduling, a method by which some of the NFL's best games could be moved from the afternoon to the evening on Sunday on short notice. Given these factors, as well as the rise of ABC's ratings on Sunday night, and the network's wish of protecting its Desperate Housewives franchise (which they knew would be costly), on April 18, 2005, ABC and the NFL announced the end of their 36-year partnership, with the Monday Night Football broadcasts being moved to ESPN starting with the 2006 season; the move was criticized by some of the Disney shareholders (as well as NFL fans and purists). However, ESPN's ability to collect subscription fees from cable and satellite providers, in addition to selling commercials, made it more likely that ESPN could turn a profit on NFL telecasts, as opposed to ABC's heavy losses. The final Monday Night Football broadcast on ABC aired on December 26, 2005, when the New York Jets hosted the New England Patriots from Giants Stadium. Coincidentally, both the first and last ABC Monday Night Football game telecasts ended with a score of 31–21 with the Jets on the losing end. Vinny Testaverde holds the distinction of throwing the last TD pass in ABC's MNF telecast history; it was to wide receiver Laveranues Coles. Also, Testaverde's pass set an NFL record: most consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass, 19 seasons (1987–2005). Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel set a record of note during that last ABC telecast, becoming the first player to catch two touchdown passes and record a quarterback sack in the same game. The final play of the ABC era was a Pats kneeldown by 44-year-old reserve quarterback Doug Flutie. John Madden said at the show's ending: During its final NFL television contract, ABC was awarded the telecasts to Super Bowl XXXIV, Super Bowl XXXVII and Super Bowl XL. With the end of ABC's contract, the Super Bowl XL broadcast was the network's final NFL telecast until 2016, when they simulcasted ESPN's Wild Card game production. To replace Monday Night Football, ABC turned its series of primetime college football specials, which had run until 1975 and again from 1990 to 1993 and from 1996 onward, into a regular series. The network also acquired the rights to the CMA Awards ceremony. The Monday after ABC's final Monday Night game saw the premiere of Dancing With the Stars. 2006–present: ESPN era Move to ESPN The changes to the NFL's prime time broadcasts took place with the 2006 season, as ESPN began airing the Monday night games at the same time NBC assumed the rights to the Sunday night package from ESPN. The Sunday night game is now the \\"showcase\\" game of the week on the NFL schedule. While the ESPN broadcasts still carry the MNF name and heritage, NBC (like ABC) is a broadcast network, whereas ESPN is a cable channel not freely available to all Americans, though per a clause in the NFL's broadcasting rules, many ESPN games air on a participating broadcast television station in the home markets of each team to allow viewers who do not subscribe to a pay television provider to view the game. For that reason, NBC gained rights to the Thursday night season-opening game, the Wild Card doubleheader that has traditionally aired on ABC, as well as a share of the rotating rights to the Super Bowl (with CBS and Fox also in the mix). ESPN had initially stated that its MNF team would consist of Al Michaels and Joe Theismann in the booth, with Michele Tafoya and Suzy Kolber serving as sideline reporters. However, on February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that former NBA studio host Mike Tirico would replace Michaels in the booth in 2006, joined by Theismann, and Tony Kornheiser. ESPN announced the following day that it had \\"traded\\" the contract of Michaels to NBC in exchange for some NBCUniversal properties, including rights to Ryder Cup coverage, and the return of the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (a Walt Disney creation) to ESPN parent The Walt Disney Company after nearly 80 years of Universal ownership. =Secondary broadcast teams= Since the program's move to ESPN in 2006, the network has broadcast two games in a doubleheader on the opening week of the season, with the second game using separate announcers and production staff that are not used for the rest of the schedule. On September 11, 2006, the announcers for the second game were Brad Nessler, Ron Jaworski and Dick Vermeil. On September 10, 2007, the team of Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic (co-hosts of Mike and Mike in the Morning) presided alongside Mike Ditka. For both games, Bonnie Bernstein was the sideline reporter. Greenberg, Golic and Ditka served as the secondary team for the September 8, 2008 game, with Suzy Kolber on the sidelines. The September 14, 2009 game had Steve Young join Greenberg, Golic and Kolber. On September 13, 2010, Nessler and Trent Dilfer teamed to call the second game, with Kolber again on the sidelines. Tirico, Theismann, and Kornheiser ESPN's first Monday night broadcast was a preseason game held on August 14, 2006, when the Oakland Raiders visited the Minnesota Vikings, publicized as the return of Randy Moss to Minnesota for the first time since the Vikings traded him after the 2004 season. The telecast debuted with brand-new graphics, including a time-score box placed in the lower center of the screen; a variation of the MNF graphics began to be used on almost all sporting events televised by ESPN and ABC (the former of which effectively took over full responsibility of ABC's sports division that year, which was rebranded as ESPN on ABC). The first regular season Monday Night Football game to air on ESPN was on September 11, 2006, featuring the visiting Minnesota Vikings at the Washington Redskins at FedExField, in which the Vikings won 19–16. The September 25 edition of Monday Night Football highlighted the New Orleans Saints' first game back in the Louisiana Superdome following Hurricane Katrina to take on the Atlanta Falcons. The game had a Super Bowl-like atmosphere with performances by the Goo Goo Dolls, U2 and Green Day before the game. The NFL tapped producer Don Mischer and director Hamish Hamilton to produce the event. Former President George H. W. Bush handled the pregame coin toss. The Saints beat the Falcons 23–3 in what now ranks as one of the most-watched events in the history of cable television. ESPN's October 23, 2006 game telecast between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys drew the largest audience in the history of cable television at the time, besting the previous mark set by a 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) debate between Al Gore and Ross Perot. An average of 16,028,000 viewers (12.8 rating) watched as the Giants defeated the Cowboys, 36–22. ESPN's Monday Night Football telecasts now account for eight of the ten highest-rated programs in cable television history. What would eventually be named the \\"NFL's comeback of the year\\" was played on Monday Night Football on October 16. Late in the third quarter, the massive underdog Arizona Cardinals led the Chicago Bears 23–3. Arizona seemed to have the game wrapped up, as rookie quarterback Matt Leinart was having a great day, and Arizona had forced six turnovers out of Chicago quarterback Rex Grossman. Chicago's defense then went on to score 14 points on fumble returns for touchdowns. With 2:58 left in the fourth quarter, and down 17–23, Chicago's Devin Hester returned a punt for a touchdown to take a 24–23 lead. Leinart then led the Cardinals down the field, only to have Neil Rackers miss a field goal, and Chicago went on to win. At the conclusion of the 2006 season, ESPN had managed to secure all of the cable television audience records. Monday Night Football and its surrounding shoulder programming also became the most profitable franchise on cable television. Tirico, Jaworski, and Kornheiser Analyst and former NFL quarterback Ron Jaworski replaced Joe Theismann, who was offered a prominent football analyst job with ESPN, in the booth beginning with the 2007 season. =2007= On December 3, 2007, 17.5 million people watched the undefeated New England Patriots defeat the Baltimore Ravens, 27–24. The game became the most-watched single cable television program of all-time by total viewership, breaking the previous record set by the August 17 premiere of High School Musical 2, which was viewed by 17.2 million on ESPN corporate sibling Disney Channel (after the film was surpassed by the Patriots-Ravens game, High School Musical 2 retained the record as the highest-rated non-sports program in basic cable history). =2008= After experiencing low ratings and criticism about the production during the 2007 season, ESPN announced that long-time sideline reporters Suzy Kolber and Michele Tafoya would have reduced roles for the 2008 season. As the 2008 season began, ESPN announced a new focus on covering the games as sporting events rather than as entertainment and cultural events. Among the changes were the removal of celebrity booth guests and a reduction in the number of sideline interviews. Tafoya and Kolber were retained to conduct those interviews and file reports from the field. In addition, ESPN replaced the bottom center-screen time-score box introduced in 2006 (which was used until the 2008 preseason) with a horizontal time-score banner across the bottom of the screen. The September 15, 2008 Eagles-Cowboys game, with a 13.3 rating and 18.6 million viewers, set a new record for the most-watched cable television program, surpassing the record set the previous October by the Patriots-Ravens game. 2008 election eve The night before the 2008 United States Presidential Election, studio host Chris Berman interviewed both major party candidates, Republican nominee John McCain and Democratic nominee Barack Obama at halftime. The November 3, 2008 game featured the Washington Redskins losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 23–6. Tirico, Jaworski, and Gruden =2009 season= Tony Kornheiser stepped down for the 2009 season and was replaced by former Oakland Raiders and Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Jon Gruden. The rest of the team remained intact. The October 5, 2009 Packers-Vikings game was the fourth ESPN MNF broadcast to become the most-watched program ever on a cable channel, with a 15.3 rating and 21.839 million viewers. The record stood until it was surpassed by the network's telecast of the BCS National Championship Game on January 10, 2011. =2010 season-\\"Monday Night Massacre\\" (Eagles)= On November 15, 2010, the Eagles visited the Redskins, in what was Donovan McNabb's second game against the Eagles since being traded on April 4 of that year. The Redskins won the first meeting that season by a score of 17–12; however, in the first half of the game, Eagles star quarterback Michael Vick suffered a rib injury knocking him out of the game, resulting in Kevin Kolb taking over. After the game, McNabb gave a post-game speech in the locker room in which he stated the Eagles made a mistake by trading him. Before the game, McNabb signed a five- year contract extension worth $78 million, after being benched in the fourth quarter just a week earlier. The very first play of the game Vick threw an 88-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. The Redskins were criticized for their lack of coverage because the Eagles were known for going deep on the first play; the Eagles' next two possessions led to touchdowns. The very first play of the second quarter, with Philadelphia up 28–0, saw Vick throw a 48-yard touchdown to Jeremy Maclin. With Philadelphia up 45–21 at halftime, Vick threw a three-yard touchdown to Jason Avant in the third quarter to make the score 52–21. During the play, Vick scrambled, waiting for someone to get open when Albert Haynesworth (who signed a six-year $100 million contract with the Redskins the year prior) had fallen down and continued to lie on the field as Vick continued to scramble. The very next Redskins possession had McNabb throw a pick six to Dimitri Patterson, helping the Eagles score seven points. The Redskins went on to score one more touchdown, however their seven-point run was not able to stop Philadelphia, which defeated Washington 59–28. McNabb finished the game with 295 yards on 17 for 31, along with two touchdowns and three interceptions. The Eagles finished with 593 offense yards (setting a new team record); Vick went 20 of 28 for 333 yards throwing four touchdowns, and also ran for 80 yards and two touchdowns on eight carries. He became the first player with at least 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing four passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns in a game. Vick's performance in the game also moved him past Steve Young for second place on the all-time list for rushing yards by a quarterback. Hank Williams Jr. controversy On October 3, 2011, Hank Williams Jr. made controversial remarks during an interview on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, when talking about a golf outing he went on that summer with Barack Obama, John Boehner, Joe Biden and John Kasich. Williams compared President Obama and Speaker of the House Boehner golfing together to \\"Hitler playing golf with [Israeli prime minister] Netanyahu\\", stressing their philosophical and political differences. On October 6, 2011, ESPN subsequently announced that it would stop using \\"All My Rowdy Friends\\" as its theme song (as the song is still owned by Williams) and drop Williams from the show's opening. Williams commented on the matter: \\"After reading hundreds of e-mails, I have made my decision... By pulling my opening October 3, [ESPN] stepped on the toes of the First Amendment Freedom of Speech, so therefore me, my song, and All My Rowdy Friends are out of here. It's been a great run.\\" MNF was absent an opening sequence from Week 4 through the end of that season. In 2017, ESPN re-hired Hank Williams Jr. for the intro.

The organization supports and promotes international wild cat research and conservation by collaborating on field research projects, partnering with other environmental organizations, and developing community outreach and education programs. History FCF was founded in 2006 by conservationist and entrepreneur Zara McDonald. As a competitive marathon runner, McDonald twice encountered mountain lions during solitary runs in the Marin Headlands in Northern California. These encounters led her to become involved in California mountain lion research in 2002, and she soon expanded her research work to include other wild cat species. In the fall of 2004, after returning from extended capture work with mountain lions, she began developing a conservation model that combined scientific research with education and outreach programs. This led her to found the Felidae Conservation Fund (501(c)(3)) in April 2006. Today Felidae supports and collaborates in scientific research projects in nine countries, promotes community-level education and outreach programs, and fosters international cooperation among scientists, conservationists, governments, and environmental NGOs. Felidae is based in Sausalito, California, and raises money through donations, grants, fundraising events and online social networks. Mission and philosophy FCF's mission is to advance the conservation of the planet's wild cat species and their habitats through partnerships in research, education and technology. Its model is to collaborate on research studies that examine human impact on wild cats and their habitats, then disseminate the results in outreach and education programs designed to convince people of the importance of preserving the natural environment. Felidae collaborates with scientists, educators, communities and lawmakers with the goal of protecting ecosystems, staving off further extinctions, and promoting healthy ways for humans to coexist with wild cats and their habitats. Felidae's focus on wild cat conservation is motivated by the belief that the study of wild cats can serve as a leverage point for addressing the broader environmental issues of habitat loss, human- nature interactions, and wildlife sustainability. This belief is based on the idea that because cats are often the top predators in the ecosystems they inhabit, understanding and solving the problems they face can inform and guide the conservation and preservation of wild animals and wild habitats of all kinds. Programs Felidae currently collaborates on research projects in field locations around the globe, including the United States, Malaysia, Mongolia, Chile, Peru, Iran, Namibia and Pakistan. Felidae provides strategic guidance, funding, field support, supplies and equipment to its project partners to help them achieve their research goals. To link this scientific research to conservation efforts, Felidae incorporates the results of field studies into its outreach and education programs. These include talks and presentations throughout the US, collaborations with artists and video producers to convey the conservation message through visual media, and online projects aimed at educating young people through an interactive portal, an online and mobile phone game, and social network activities. Partnerships and collaboration In its field work and conservation efforts FCF collaborates with the following organizations: National Park Service, California State Parks, California Department of Fish and Game, UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, Wildlife Conservation Society, Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, Snow Leopard Trust, Snow Leopard Conservancy, International Wildlife Film Festival, Craighead Beringa South, Cheetah Conservation Fund and the International League of Conservation Photographers, among many other organizations. Science and research Felidae's scientific research projects are based in field locations around the globe. The Bay Area Puma Project in Northern California is the first comprehensive study of mountain lions in the San Francisco Bay Area. A primary goal of this study is to determine priority locations for wildlife overpasses and underpasses to maintain connectivity for the region's wildlife populations. In addition, the study uses GPS collars equipped with accelerometers to record detailed information on mountain lion movements that will reveal new insights into their behavior and physiology. Felidae is working with Dr. Chris Wilmers of UC Santa Cruz, along with the California Department of Fish and Game and California State Parks. The Patagonia Puma Project in Chile is a long-term ecological study by Dr. Heiko Wittmer of UC Davis which examines the dynamics relating to the puma’s role in the decline of the huemul deer. The researchers hope to exonerate the puma from major blame in the huemul's decline. The Bornean Wild Cat and Clouded Leopard Project in Malaysia investigates the conservation needs of five species of Bornean wild cats (Bornean clouded leopard, bay cat, flat-headed cat, marbled cat, and leopard cat). The study will use GPS collars and radio tracking to document spatial patterns, ranging behavior, activity patterns, and habitat use. Felidae is working in partnership with the Global Canopy Programme (UK), the Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation at the University of Malaysia, and Oxford graduate students Andrew Hearn and Joanna Ross. The Study on Endangered Snow Leopards in Mongolia is a long-term research project that will answer basic ecological and behavioral questions about the mysterious and elusive snow leopard. The study will be conducted using GPS collars, non-invasive genetics, and camera trapping with advanced mark-recapture modeling. It will attempt to answer basic questions about snow leopards (birth and mortality rates, cub survival, dispersal rates, habitat use, and home range size) that are currently unknown due to their cryptic nature and inaccessible habitat. Felidae's partners in the project are the Snow Leopard Trust and the Wildlife Conservation Society. The Teton Cougar Project in Wyoming studies the population dynamics of mountain lions in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem by examining predation, behavior associated with human development, and interactions with wolves, grizzly bears and black bears. The project is operated by Craighead Beringia South with support from Felidae. The Southern California Puma Project examines the progress and implications of habitat fragmentation as puma populations in Southern California become more isolated. Felidae is collaborating with UC Davis Wildlife Health Center on this study, which has radio-collared more than 50 pumas over 7 years. The Asiatic Cheetah Project in Iran is the first detailed ecological study of the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah. Researchers in Northern Iran work to gain insight into the cheetahs’ movements within and between reserves, information that can help scientists to protect the cats' habitat and stave off extinction. The Snow Leopard Conservation Project in Pakistan is a high-profile study in the North Western Frontier Province of Pakistan in which the first ever GPS collar was placed on a snow leopard, as seen in the BBC documentary \\"Snow Leopard: Beyond the Myth\\". The study is a partnership between Snow Leopard Trust, WWF-Pakistan, NWFP Wildlife Department, and Felidae Conservation Fund. The African Cheetah Project in Namibia is an ongoing study of the African cheetah that includes camera- trapping, spoor tracking, and DNA research. The study is led by the Cheetah Conservation Fund and Dr. Laurie Marker with support from Felidae.
