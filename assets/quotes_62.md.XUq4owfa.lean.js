The active core of the Omega West Reactor. Very few production nuclear reactors were ever designed with viewing windows. The blue glow seen in the picture is characteristic of Cherenkov radiation. Core design The core consisted of an aluminum grid with 54 vertical channels arranged in 6 rows by 9 channels wide. The channels could be used for fuel rods, experiments and additional uses. An additional 8 channels were used for control rods. The core was contained in a cylindrical stainless steel tank 2.4 meters in diameter and 7.3 meters tall. The core was surrounded by a heavy concrete shield which also served as a secondary containment vessel.A. Andrade, and T. A.

Document# LA- UR-94-144 http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10122557-cNGbDP/native/10122557.pdf One of the configurations of the reactor had a lead gamma ray shield installed in the first row and beryllium blocks installed in row 6. This left rows 2 through 5 for installation of fuel and experimental usage. A typical core loading consisted of 33 fuel elements, each containing 236 grams of 93% enriched Uranium (when new). Cooling and moderation was provided by ordinary (light) water which transferred heat out of the core to the air via cooling towers. The reactor could be operated at low power in natural convection mode. At full power the flowrate through the core was 13,250 liters/minute. Shutdown The reactor operated successfully until 1992 when an unplanned power spike caused an automatic shutdown. During the shut down an investigation revealed a tritium contaminated cooling water leak at which time the Department of Energy had the fuel rods removed and placed the reactor in permanent safe shut down mode and scheduled for decontamination and decommissioning. The OWR was fully decommissioned in 1994 and demolished in 2003.

In the course of performing its missions in the War on Terrorism, members of the United States Armed Forces discover vast amounts of documents in many formats and languages. When documents are suspected of containing information of potential intelligence value, rapid and accurate interpretation of the information identifies targets, bolsters success in subsequent operations, and enhances tactical and strategic all-source intelligence efforts. The sheer volume of documents acquired in the course of military operations can overwhelm a unit's capability to extract meaningful information in a timely manner. A DOCEX facility was also operated by the Secure Evidence Unit (SEU) of the Iraqi High Tribunal to extract evidence from seized Iraqi regime documents. Over 6 million pages were processed resulting in numerous execution orders and other incriminating documents being made available to the court. This Docex facility differed in that it was operated mostly by Iraqis with international management. This facility was focused on evidence rather than intelligence as most documents seized dated from the 1980s. Definitions DOCEX is the systematic extraction of information from threat documents for the purpose of producing intelligence or answering information requirements. A threat document has been in the possession of the threat, written by the threat, or is directly related to a future threat situation. DOCEX can occur in conjunction with HUMINT collection activities or as a separate activity.Army Public Affairs A document is any piece of recorded information regardless of form. Documents include printed materials (books, magazines, pamphlets, maps), official records (government or military origin), currency, maps, blueprints, personal information (diaries, notebooks, journals, photographs, letters, invoices, bank statements), electronically recorded media (computer files, tape recordings, video recordings) and all electronic equipment used to generate or store electronic media (cell phones, computers, cameras, PDAs). For the purpose of this entry, DOCEX is considered a military field activity conducted in conjunction with combat operations and separate from Document and Media Exploitation (DOMEX). DOMEX is the processing, translation, analysis, and dissemination of collected hard copy documents and electronic media which are under the U.S. Government's physical control and are not publicly available. This definition of DOMEX excludes: handling of documents and media during the collection, initial review, and inventory process; and documents and media withheld from the U.S. Intelligence Community DOMEX dissemination system in accordance with agreements and policies sanctioned by the Director of National Intelligence to protect sources and methods.FAS For the purpose of this entry, DOMEX is considered a multi-organizational activity under the oversight of the DOMEX Committee composed of senior executives of the National Media Exploitation Center, Defense Intelligence Agency (as executive agent), Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Defense Cyber Crime Center, United States Army, National Security Agency, Drug Enforcement Administration and Department of Homeland Security. DOCEX Process The DOCEX process occurs at the lowest echelons possible to facilitate rapid exploitation of captured materials. Service members gain fundamental knowledge of the DOCEX process via common skills training, such as the U.S. Army's Basic Leader Course. The initial intake of captured enemy documents (CED) is performed at the company level by a DOCEX Site Exploitation Team and first analysis of CED is performed by military intelligence personnel assigned to battalion or brigade level DOCEX Support Teams. Actionable information gained through battalion or brigade level DOCEX assets is reported back to the unit that captured the information as expeditiously as possible to fulfill immediate intelligence requirements. The processing of CED progresses from the lowest echelon to the highest, undergoing multiple information extraction applications that increase in complexity and sophistication until the information is categorized as DOMEX under the auspices of the U.S. Intelligence Community and the Director of National Intelligence. The sequence of events in the DOCEX process as performed by a DOCEX Site Exploitation Team is as follows: # Receive, Tag # Categorize, Inventory, Log # Screen # Sight Translation (Hybrid Translation/Interpretation) # Analyze # Report 1. Tag Document accountability begins the moment the document is received into U.S. possession. Original documents must not be marked, altered or defaced and the capturing unit must attach a DD Form 2745 (Enemy Prisoner of War Capture Tag) to each document. Ongoing combat operations suspends this requirement (to tag a document) until cessation of hostilities. All CEDs are placed in weatherproof containers and the containers are marked with a DTG, name of the capturing unit, identity of the source(s) of the CEDs, and a summary of conditions and circumstances under which the CEDs were obtained. 2. Categorize, Inventory, Log The first DOCEX unit to receive CEDs will categorize and inventory all CEDs. Captured enemy documents are assigned file numbers and the following information is logged: name of capturing unit, file number, DTG the CEDs were received by the DOCEX unit, description of the CEDs, destination of outgoing transmittals of CEDs and pertinent remarks. Proper categorization and inventory of captured enemy documents ensures strict accountability and preserves evidentiary value. 3. Screen Document screening is the rapid but systematic evaluation of documents to determine which documents contain priority information. Selected priority documents will be exploited immediately to meet intelligence collection management priorities. For screening purposes, CEDs are considered unclassified unless originated in the U.S. and/or allied nation(s), and are marked classified. The document screening phase is an integral step in the DOCEX process as screening determines applicability of a variety of exploitation treatments and procedures. Interpreters and qualified intelligence analysts working alongside communications and information technology specialists decide the DOCEX course of action during the screening phase. Complete translation is not required at this phase of the DOCEX process, but sufficient translation of documents is required to determine significance and relevance to priority intelligence requirements. 4. Translate Translations in and of themselves are not intelligence reports, but translation is a precondition for DOCEX. Translation reports must include: where the report will be sent, which unit prepared the report, DTG of the translation, document serial number and description of the document, name of translator, type of translation (full, extract or summary), remarks for clarification and classification (if applicable). 5. Analyze Analysis of CEDs produces intelligence and involves three steps: assessment, integration and deduction. * Assessment ‚Äì The sifting and sorting of evaluated information to update significant themes with respect to current and imminent operations and commander's intent. Intelligence information deemed urgent will be disseminated at this stage prior to further processing. * Integration ‚Äì The combination of newly developed information isolated in the assessment phase with known information to develop an overall picture or hypothesis of enemy activities or environmental factors influencing the area of operation. * Deduction ‚Äì Conclusions are drawn from the comparison of CED data with known information to bring about meaningful relations among enemy situations, the area of operation, commander's intent and force protection. 6. Report Information collected from CEDs is normally reported in a SALUTE report or Intelligence Information Report (IIR) (SALUTE = Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment). The IIR is the most widely recognized and accepted format within the Intelligence Community, and is typically generated at higher echelons, such as division, corps or theater commands. SALUTE reports are also referred to as SPOT reports or SPOTREPS and are expeditious reports to provide timely intelligence or status updates regarding events that could have an immediate and significant effect on current planning and operations. Tactical commanders, interrogators and intelligence analysts contribute content for SALUTE reports and IRRs.

One exception was Gallaudet, which is located in Washington, D.C. All of the members were universities, except Baltimore City College, a preparatory school located in Baltimore, Maryland. The impetus for the formation of the MIFA was a controversial game on November 1, 1893 between the Maryland Agricultural College (now known as the University of Maryland) and Saint John's College of Annapolis. Maryland won the game, 6‚Äì0, but St. John's players later wrote in the Baltimore American that \\"a decision by which the M.A.C. were allowed to score the only touchdown made by the quarterback after a run of 90 yards, with no one in pursuit, appeared a very doubtful one.\\"David Ungrady, Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, 2003, p. 4, Sports Publishing LLC. Maryland finished the season by beating Western Maryland and the Orient Athletic Club. With a 6‚Äì0 record, the \\"Aggies\\" were named the state champions, but the title was contested by St. John's. The following season, Maryland's former quarterback and coach William W. Skinner led the effort to create an intercollegiate football league to improve the process in which the state championship was awarded. The conference began competition on October 13, 1894 with games between St. John's College and Washington College in Annapolis, and Maryland Agricultural College and Western Maryland in Westminster. The association voted to disband during the 1899 season under the threat of withdrawal by Johns Hopkins University after legislation was passed to prevent its use of graduate student-athletes. The league was subsequently reorganized without Hopkins. Maryland Agricultural College claimed the championship in 1906.

It reduces the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in mammalian cells and permeable strains of yeast by the 26S complex without affecting its ATPase or isopeptidase activities. MG132 activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1), which initiates apoptosis. MG132 also inhibits NF-Œ∫B activation with an IC50 of 3 ŒºM and prevents Œ≤-secretase cleavage.

The facility was home to a variety of mental health institutions throughout the years. In 2011, the former self- sustaining mental health village was slated for demolition to make space for a proposed county park. Demolition was completed in 2012 with plans to begin construction of the conceptual park in 2013. The facility garnered much notoriety over the past decades due to its \\"ghost town\\" appearance and mention in the popular book and periodical, \\"Weird N.J.\\"Weird NJ Until its demolition, the former hospital was a popular place for \\"urban explorers\\" to explore, despite the buildings being unsafe (partially due to asbestos and lead paint contamination. Urban explorers were often met with resistance from law enforcement, as the site was prone to criminal activity, ranging from graffiti to arson. Prior to the demolition of the site, state and local governments have both made reasonable attempts to keep trespassers out, for example by sealing the entrances and windows of the property, though these methods proved to be relatively ineffective. History The facility came into existence in 1898 after former Governor Foster M. Voorhees signed a bill into law that established the New Jersey State Village for Epileptics. Intended to subvert the admittance of epileptic patients into insane asylums and other unnecessarily harsh environments, the State Village for Epileptics offered this group a much more supportive and decent atmosphere in which they could thrive. The State Village was designed to be a completely autonomous community; within its boundaries were educational and medical facilities, a theater, a fully functional farm, a firehouse, a water treatment facility, an on-site landfill, housing, and even a power plant. The institution was considered to be an exemplary and progressive facility targeted at the treatment of epileptics. In later years, namely throughout the Great Depression and World War II, the State Village suffered from financial cutbacks, which resulted in understaffing and overcrowding of the facilities. The dismal state of the institution during these times earned it the popular name, ‚ÄúThe Snake Pit of New Jersey‚Äù.New York Times With the advent of new prescription medications during the late 1940s, the State Village for Epileptics became obsolete by the early 1950s. With the aid of these new medications, many of the residents of the institution were able to function more efficiently within normal society, and were ultimately able to reintegrate themselves into the mainstream population. In 1953, the facility was turned into the New Jersey Neuro-Psychiatric Institute. This new institution focused on treatment and research of alcoholics, drug-addicts, people with cerebral palsy, and emotionally disturbed children. The State of New Jersey closed down the facility in 1995, with the very last of the patients being removed in 1998. By this time, the facility had been designated as the North Princeton Developmental Center. On , Montgomery Township purchased the property on which the NPDC resides for a total of $5.95 million.NPDC FAQ The Township intends on demolishing or renovating the existing structures and replacing them with a large town center, which might include health care facilities, shops, housing for senior citizens, and parks.Montgomery Township E-Bulletin Since the purchase of the property, the Township has experienced much difficulty with the cleanup of the site. Many hazardous materials are still on-site which make the property uninhabitable. Most of these contaminants remain from the use of oil and coal heating systems, as well as the power plant, both of which were used by the facilities prior to condemnation. The Township has also encountered large amounts of asbestos in the buildings which has proven to make the restoration exponentially more difficult and costly. Much care is being taken with the progression of this project as the Village School, the local elementary school, is surrounded by the NPDC property. After coming across these problems and unwilling to pay the associated expenses, Montgomery Township decided to sue the State of New Jersey citing the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as well as the State Environmental Rights Act. Montgomery sold 247 acres of the plot to Somerset County October 2011, and the county assumed the role of preserving the area for recreation and conservation. Demolition of the former \\"Skillman Village\\" was completed in 2012, with only one or two of the original buildings still standing. A passive recreation Somerset County Parks System facility known as Skillman Park occupies the majority of land, and includes a 2.2 mile paved multi-use loop trail built in 2014‚Äì5. The park is now open.

Mr. Segundo Lim is still an active member of the city's business circle. Dan's mother is Gloria Basa Neri, from Ozamis City. At one time, she took the cudgels as vice mayor of Tagbilaran City and presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlungsod.

Rocha became mayor he was the City Administrator. It was during this time that Tagbilaran was given national acceptance in a privilege speech by Senator Juan Flavier, making the Tagbilaran City Cooperative Hospital a model in the country. Lim has his share of political defeats, losing in his congressional bid and then losing to Jose V. Torralba twice for mayor, the last time in 2001. His time came in 2004 when he defeated Betty Torralba, the wife of last-termer Mayor Jose V. Torralba, for mayor of Tagbilaran. Lim won together with only one councilor in his lineup. In his first term, Mayor Lim prioritized social services by introducing the Blue Card System, a free hospitalization program for indigents; Free School Supplies and Uniforms Project for Public School Students; Botika sa Katawhan, a free medicine program for all residents; promotion of sports like boxing, student welfare, livelihood, among others. Lim reached out to the masses by interacting with them through the top-rated weekly Mayor's Report over a local radio station. In the local elections of 2007, mayor Lim won again by defeating the returning Jose V. Torralba for mayor by a wide margin, and this time also winning the majority of councilors in his lineup. In his second term, he continued all his projects adding other projects like senior citizens' privileges, police visibility, among others.

It was one of six themes composed for the game by Nintendo sound designer Koji Kondo, who found it to be the most difficult track to compose for it. The theme is set in the key of C major and features a swung rhythm with prominent use of syncopation. In later installments with more powerful sound hardware, it is often scored as a calypso song led by steel drums. After Super Mario Bros., it went on to become the theme of the series, and has been a fixture in most of its titles. It has been reused and remixed in other Nintendo-published games, including Tetris DS, Nintendogs: Chihuahua and Friends, WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!, and every entry in the Super Smash Bros. series. Composition Koji Kondo, the theme's composer Of the six tracks of the Super Mario Bros. soundtrack, this theme took the most time to develop, according to its composer Koji Kondo. He stated that he would write one piece, and the team would put it in the game. If it did not accentuate the action, did not time up with Mario running and jumping, or did not harmonize with the sound effects well enough, he would scrap it. He used only a small keyboard to compose the music. The first theme he made for Super Mario Bros. was based on an early prototype of the game, which simply showed Mario running around a big empty area. Kondo described this early theme as a bit lazier, slower tempo, and more laid back. As the game underwent changes, he realized that his theme no longer fit, so he increased the pace and changed it around to fit better. In an interview, Kondo explained that compositional ideas come to him during everyday activities. Kondo was given complete creative freedom over the soundtrack of Super Mario Bros., and would collaborate with Shigeru Miyamoto, the game's director, through their daily interactions. Miyamoto would share his records and music scores of the type of themes he liked with Kondo, but did not tell him exactly what he wanted. It was composed with a Latin rhythm. When the player has less than 100 units of time left to complete the stage, the music's tempo accelerates. At the Game Developers Conference in 2007, Kondo commented that the theme features rhythm, balance, and interactivity. He demonstrated this with a short clip of Super Mario Bros., showing the character's movements and players' button presses syncing with the beat of the music. He also added that the theme reflects the action-oriented gameplay of the series. Kondo stated that he was not sure if he could make any future music of his \\"catchier\\" than it. In other media The theme was reused in multiple other media, including the anime film Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen! and The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! television series. Lyrics Japanese lyrics were originally submitted in 1985 by fans of the Japanese radio program Takao Komine All Night Nippon. The recorded version of the song with lyrics was released in 1986 under the name \\"Go Go Mario!!\\". The song is interpreted by Princess Peach, voiced by Hiroko Taniyama. The song was also released on vinyl, called Mario No Daibouken. Performances The song was first performed live on All Night Nippon in 1986. The theme has been featured in many concerts, including \\"PLAY! Chicago\\", the Columbus Symphony, the Mario & Zelda Big Band Live, Play! A Video Game Symphony, and others. The Video Games Live concert featured the theme performed by Kondo. In December 2016, Mario series creator Shigeru Miyamoto performed the theme on guitar with American hip hop group The Roots on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Sheet music For decades, Nintendo had not published official sheet music for Kondo's compositions. In 2011, Alfred Music published three officially licensed music folios of the music from Super Mario Bros. for piano and guitar. These were followed in 2013 by three more folios for New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and a folio of jazz styled arrangements of Super Mario Bros. themes. Reception In an article about Kondo, Wired.com editor Chris Kohler described the theme as one of the most famous in the world, and that \\"it gets into your head quickly and won't leave\\". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com called it one of the most memorable tracks in video game history. Netjak editor Rick Healey commented that though MTV tried to make the quintessential song of the '80s, Nintendo beat them to the punch with the Super Mario Bros. theme. Editors Jeff Dickerson and Luke Smith of The Michigan Daily newspaper commented that if you were to ask a random student to hum the theme, they would likely know every note. Sam Kennedy, also an editor for 1UP.com, stated that anyone who lived through the '80s can hum the theme, and that most people remember it to this day. Video game music composer Tommy Tallarico cited Kondo as his inspiration for why he got into music, commenting that when he first heard this theme, it was the first time he thought music in video games really existed. Mario voice actor Charles Martinet commented that \\"The first time I ever played a Mario game, I started at about 4 in the evening and played until daylight. I laid down on the bed, closed my eyes, and I could hear that music ‚Äì ba dum bum ba dum DUM!\\" Former Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu called Kondo one of the best video game composers in the industry, commenting that he was sure everyone in the world who has come across the Super Mario Bros. theme, regardless of borderlines or age, will never forget it, while also adding that it should become the new national anthem of Japan. In an interview with Kondo, 1UP.com editor Sam Kennedy stated that Paul and Linda McCartney visited Kondo in Japan and enjoyed the theme. The ringtone version of the theme has proven very popular in the United States, having been on the top ten most downloaded ringtones for 112 straight weeks as of November 2004. Approximately 747,900 copies were sold in the United States in 2006.

Note the inner barrel (to be connected to the vacuum source), and the outer barrel connected to the pot. The condenser is not attached. Abderhalden's drying pistol is a piece of laboratory glassware used to free samples from traces of water, or other impurities. It is called a \\"pistol\\" because of its resemblance to the firearm. Its use has declined due to modern hotplate technology and vacuum pumps. The apparatus was first described in a book edited by Emil Abderhalden. The drying pistol allows the sample to be dried at elevated temperature; this is especially preferred when storage in a desiccator at room temperature does not give satisfactory results. Operation The drying pistol consists of two concentric barrels; the inner is connected to a vacuum source via a trap. The outer barrel is connected at the bottom to a round bottom flask, and a condenser. To operate the drying pistol, a sample is placed within the inner barrel, and the barrel is evacuated. The round bottom flask, filled with an appropriate solvent, is heated to a boil. Hot vapors warm the inner barrel; losses are avoided with the condenser. By choosing the appropriate solvent, the temperature at which the sample is dried can be selected. The trap is filled with an appropriate material: water is removed with phosphorus pentoxide, acidic gases by potassium or sodium hydroxide, and organic solvents by thin pieces of paraffin. However, use of these agents has been shown to have little efficacy. Generally, the main impurity to be removed is water. This set-up allows the desiccation of heat-sensitive compounds under relatively mild conditions. Removing these trace impurities is especially important to give good results for elemental analysis and gravimetric analysis.

Their population area extended approximately from modern-day Asturias to La Rioja. Primary sources The Chronica of John of Biclar says, under the sixth year of the Emperor Justin II and the fourth of Leovigild, that is, 572, Miro Suevorum rex bellum contra Runcones movet (\\"Miro, king of the Suevi, moved [to make] war on the Runcones\\"). The Historia Suevorum of Isidore of Seville notes that \\"the Suevic king Miro, son of Theudemir, in the year 572, attacked and lorded it over the Arragones and the Rucones.\\" In the same author's Historia Gothorum, he writes, under the heading Sisebutus rg. an. VIII¬∞ (the eighth year of Sisebut) that Astures et Ruccones in montibus reuellantes humiliabit et suis per omnia benibolus fuit (\\"the Astures and Ruccones, surrounded in the mountains, he [Sisebut] humiliated and forced to submit\\"). The tenth-century Chronica Albeldensis copies the record of Isidore: :Iste potestate Iudeos ad fidem Xpi perduxit. Eclesiam sancte Leocadie Toleto opere miro fundabit. Astures et Ruccones in montibus reuellantes humiliabit et suis per omnia benibolus fuit. Hunc uni proprio morbo, alii inmoderato potionis austo asserunt interfectum sub imperatore Eraclio. Tune nefandus Mahomat in Africa nequitiam legis stultis populis predicabit.Translation pending. History In 572 Miro, the king of the Suevi of Galicia, campaigned against the Ruccones, as much to prevent them from falling under the sway of the Visigoths as to reassert his own sovereignty over them. In 616 the Visigothic king Sisebut is recorded as having reduced some Asturian rebels and then surrounded the Ruccones in the mountains and defeated them. Under Sisebut the general Suinthila attained the rank of dux (duke) and is recorded as scoring a victory over the Ruccones. Campaigns against the Ruccones may be related to the foundation of a mint at P√©sicos, which coined trientes for Gundemar and Sisebut.Narciso Santos Yanguas and Carlos Vera Garc√≠a (1999), \\"P√©sicos y las acu√±aciones visigodas en Asturias\\", Nvmisma, 242, 57-79. The Visigoths are known to have established mints in territories recently conquered as a way of spreading their authority.L. A. Garc√≠a Moreno (1989), Historia de Espa√±a visigoda, 331. Identification Scholars have worked out many identifications for the obscure Ruccones with more well known peoples. Ignacio Fern√°ndez de Mata identified them with the Cantabri.Ignacio Fern√°ndez de Mata, \\"Pueblos y cr√≥nicas: Interpretaciones sobre el enigma de los rucones bajo una perspectiva etnohist√≥rica\\". Revista Mnemosyne: Revista de la Asociaci√≥n de J√≥venes Historiadores de Espa√±a, 4(1997):106-140, especially page 133. On another hypothesis they may be the Araucones, who lived in a semi-autonomous state on the border of the Visigothic and Suevic kingdoms. According to the Parroquial Suevo they were attached to the diocese of Astorga by king Miro. Based on toponymic evidence, they may have inhabited the region around Villuercas, along the banks of the Ruecas and √Årrago rivers in the modern Extremadura between Trujillo and Logros√°n, which was a Suevic territory in the fifth century. The Spanish Royal Academy of History makes the case for an identification with the Basques, considering them, like the Cantabrians, a regional subcategory. Finally, they may be identified with the Luggones, one of the principal peoples of the Asturias. Among scholars assenting to this last suggestion are the archaeologist Jos√© Luis Maya, who follows Diego Santos,Jos√© Luis Maya (1989), Los castros en Asturias , 133. and Miguel Calleja Puerta, who regards it as at least an increasing possibility.In Historia de Asturias, Adolfo Fern√°ndez P√©rez and Florencio Friera Su√°rez, edd.

The view is from the bottom (shorted end) of the resonators. The local oscillator and RF amplifier boards attach to the bottom of the assembly and have loops that couple to the resonators forming respectively the input and output ports of the filter. A helical resonator is a passive electrical component that can be used as a filter resonator. Physically, a helical resonator is a wire helix surrounded by a square or cylindrical conductive shield. One end of the helix is connected to the shield and the other end is left open (Weston, 2001, p. 660). The device works like a coaxial resonator, but it is much shorter because the helical inner conductor reduces the velocity of wave propagation (Lancaster, 2006, p. 99). Like cavity resonators, helical resonators can achieve Q factors in the 1000s. This is because at high frequencies, the skin effect results in most of the current flowing on the surface of the helix and shield. Plating the shield walls and helix with high conductivity materials increases the Q beyond that of bare copper (Blattenberger, 1989). The length of wire is one quarter of the wavelength of interest. The helix is space wound, the gap between turns is equal to the diameter of the wire (Blattenberger, 1989). If the open end of the helix is close to the end cap of the metal shield the length is somewhat reduced due to the capacitance between the conductor and the shield (Whittaker, 2000, p. 227). Coupling to the resonator can be achieved with a tap wire soldered to the helix at some distance from the shorted end. Input impedance varies with distance from the shorted end by impedance transformer action. The tap point is chosen to achieve an impedance match with the connected circuit. Tuning of the resonator may be achieved by inserting a screw into the central axis of the helix (Weston, 2001, p. 660). Other means of input and output coupling used are a wire loop coupling to the magnetic field near the shorted end, or a probe capacitively coupling near the open end. Coupling between resonators in a multi-resonator filter is often simply achieved with apertures in the shielding between them (Whittaker, 2000, p. 227). Helical resonators are well suited to UHF frequencies ranging from 600 MHz to 1500 MHz (Blattenberger, 1989).

Geography Ajdabiya is situated in central northern Libya near the Mediterranean Sea coast at the eastern end of the Gulf of Sidra. It is located on an arid plain about from the sea and is approximately from the Libyan capital of Tripoli and from Libya's second largest city, Benghazi. The city is the site of an important crossroads between the coastal road from Tripoli to Benghazi and inland routes south to the oasis at Jalu and east to Tobruk and the border with Egypt. Ajdabiya lies close to the Sabkhat Ghuzayyil a large dry region below sea level. Climate Ajdabiya has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh).  History  Ajdabiya has been identified as the site of the Roman city of Corniclanum, which is shown on the Peutinger Table of the Roman road network in the fourth or fifth centuries AD.al- ªƒÄmmah lil-ƒÄthƒÅr wa-al-MatƒÅ·∏•if wa-al-Ma·∏•f≈´·∫ìƒÅt, IdƒÅrah. Libya antiqua, Volumes 8‚Äì10, p. xlii. Libyan Department of Antiquities, 1971 It gained its importance for two reasons: it possessed drinkable water, which made it a useful staging post in an arid region, and it stood on the intersection of two important trade routes, the coastal route along the North African littoral and the desert caravan route from the oases of Jalu and al-Ujlah. The town passed to the Byzantine Empire following the fall of Rome but gained new importance under the rule of the Fatimid Caliphate. After sacking the town in 912, the Fatimids redeveloped Ajdabiya and built a new mosque and palace complex, the ruins of which can still be seen. Around 1051‚Äì52 it was sacked again, this time by the Beni Hilal and Banu Sulaym, Arab tribes that migrated to North Africa at the instigation of the Fatimids. It subsequently fell into a prolonged period of decline. In the 12th century, the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi described Ajdabiya as \\"a town situated on a flat, stony plateau\\". He wrote in his treatise Nuzhat al-Mushtaq (published in Europe as De geographia universali): :In olden times [Ajdabiya] was surrounded by walls, but now only two forts remain standing in the desert. Ajdabiya is four miles distant from the sea. There is no vegetation in the town nor around it. The majority of its inhabitants are Jewish and Muslim merchants. Around the town tribes of the Berber wander about in great numbers. There is no running water either in Ajdabiya or in Barqa, and the people get their water from cisterns and water- pits (sawani), [which they use] to grow a small amount of wheat, but mainly barley and various kinds of pulses and cereals. Ajdabiya museum The town was later revived by the Ottomans to serve as a minor administrative centre for western Cyrenaica. It became an important centre for the Senussi movement in the early 20th century and became the capital of an autonomous Senussi-ruled region between 1920 and 1923 under the terms of an accord with Italy, which had occupied Libya from 1911. In April 1923, however, the accord broke down and the Italians seized Ajdabiya, turning it into an important military outpost. The area was the scene of heavy fighting during the Second World War; during Operation Compass, British forces forced Italian troops to retreat through Ajdabiya (February 1941, Battle of Beda Fomm), but soon later they lost control of it again on April 2, 1941, when Rommel's Afrikakorps counter- attacked. The town finally reverted to Allied control on November 23, 1942, when it was recaptured by the British 7th Armoured Division.\\"Defeat Of The Wehrmacht II ‚Äì How Alamein Was Planned And Won, The Army Commander's Vital Decisions\\". The Times, February 18, 1947; p. 5 Ajdabiya's fortunes were transformed after the war by the development of the Libyan oil industry at nearby Brega. By 1979 it had become a boom town with a population of about 32,000 people. The bulk of the male population worked in the oil industry, government service or other local service industries. The town acquired a new area of public housing, police stations, educational facilities and a general hospital run by Libya's ally Bulgaria. In other respects, however, it remained comparatively undeveloped ‚Äì many of the roads were left as dirt tracks without drainage, resulting in them being muddy and flooded in the winter and dirty and dusty in the summer. Libya's predominately tribal society also resulted in an unusual style of urbanisation; nomadic members of the Zuwaya tribe settled on the outskirts of the town and established tent camps, which they gradually replaced with houses. The layout of some areas of the town thus resembles that of nomadic camps, with a senior man in the centre of an area, his married sons nearby, with their younger brothers and their own sons clustered around them.  Libyan civil war  Ajdabiya was the site of anti-government protests on February 16‚Äì17, 2011 in which up to ten people were said to have been killed, some by pro-government snipers.Black, Ian. \\"Libya's day of rage met by bullets and loyalists\\".

The Daily Telegraph, February 20, 2011. The city subsequently came under attack from the Libyan air force and on March 15, 2011, the Libyan army encircled Ajdabiya in preparation for an assault to retake it.Crilly, Rob. \\"Libya: rebels flee stronghold of Ajdabiya as Gaddafi closes net\\".

The New York Times, March 26, 2011 On April 8, loyalist forces attempted to recapture the city. Taking advantage of a disorganised rebel retreat following the Third Battle of Brega, loyalist troops entered the city and had taken control of most of it by April 9. However, rebel forces soon regrouped and had pushed pro-Gaddafi forces out of the city by April 11, with heavy support from NATO airstrikes. The front line then stagnated outside of the city, 40 km down the road to Brega. Loyalist shells continued to intermittently strike the western gate and outskirts of the city for several days. In April 2011, the citizens of Ajdabiya decided to rename the city's principal square as \\"Tim Hetherington Square\\", in honour of the British photojournalist killed in Misrata.

He has become one of the most recognizable figures in China, serving as the lead anchor on stories such as the Sydney Olympics and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Bai worked in the newspaper industry before moving to televised news and eventually became an anchor for Focus Report and Oriental Horizon, where he had a reputation as a politically incisive journalist. During his time with CCTV, Bai has been involved in the establishment of several news commentary programs including Timeline and News 1 + 1, the first live news commentary program in China. He has also been the anchor on several more news programs and was a host on the talk show Tell It Like It Is. Born in Inner Mongolia, he lived on a university campus with his parents who were both professors and graduated from the Beijing Broadcasting Institute before beginning his career in journalism. Bai has extensively covered diplomatic ties between China and Japan during his tenure at CCTV and is part of a political consultancy group that advises the two countries on Sino-Japanese relations. He works to promote political reform through his position in the media, and critical reports on his programs have been suppressed by government censors at least once. As a humanitarian, Bai has been involved in supporting disaster relief efforts following the Sichuan earthquake and promoting efforts against HIV/AIDS. Early life and education Bai was born in Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia on August 20, 1968. His parents were intellectuals in Inner Mongolia and his father had been condemned as an \\"anti-revolutionary\\" when China was under the leadership of Mao Zedong. Both of Bai's parents were professors and he grew up on the campus of a university during his time in Inner Mongolia. Bai later graduated from the Beijing Broadcasting Institute in 1989. Career Bai started his journalistic career working for the China Broadcasting Newspaper of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, but did not consider himself suitable for televised news. He helped found the CCTV program Oriental Horizon and was chosen to be a regular anchor for the show in January 1996, sharing the post with several other journalists. Along with his co-anchors, Bai was seen as politically incisive and his work on Oriental Horizon gained him national notoriety as a television host. He hosted the first talk show in China, Tell It Like It Is alongside Shui Junyi and Cui Yongyuan and other popular news hosts. He became anchor of Focus Report on China Central Television when it was the only news commentary program in China. During his time as anchor, Bai covered news stories such as the handovers of Hong Kong and Macau, the 50th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China, and the Sydney Olympics, making him one of the most recognizable figures in China. He has also established several news programs on CCTV such as Timeline, modeled after Ted Koppel's Nightline on ABC News. Bai's reporting was the primary subject of a book about Focus Report that was written by the show's producer. News 1 + 1, another news program Bai started, was the first live news commentary program in China. During the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Bai Yansong was the lead anchor for CCTV. In the midst of warming ties between China and Japan, Bai filmed a documentary piece for CCTV in 2007 focusing on Japanese culture and the early history of Sino-Japanese relations. He had proposed filming the piece a year before, but says it was considered too sensitive to air until relations improved. Bai later presided over a forum on Sino-Japanese relations, which included ministerial-level officials from Japan and China and discussed issues such as military spending and Tibet. During the Sichuan earthquake, Bai served as the lead anchor and later noted the significance of open Chinese news coverage of the disaster by stating \\"this time, it is not a simple live coverage.\\" His reporting on the quake was praised by CCTV editor Xiong Qu for its delivery with Xiong saying Bai \\"stood the test\\" as China's lead anchor. Some of the reporting in Bai's programs has faced opposition from government censors. After a program Bai was going to air on a chemical plant in Dalian was cancelled by censors, Bai commented on his blog to criticize the decision to cancel the piece, which led to his account being blocked. Dong Qian, co-anchor of Bai's News 1 + 1 program, was temporarily taken off the air after Bo Xilai talked to the CCTV president about a piece on the program that highlighted serious concerns regarding the nature of Bo's anticorruption campaign in Chongqing. Politics Haiqing Yu has identified Bai as being part of the first generation of Chinese journalists to adopt an outsider's approach to journalism, as opposed to previous generations, who viewed their role as being to prop up the Party and the government. Bai has stated that he tries to use his position in the news media to help instigate political reform and promote democratic ideals in China and supports liberal market reforms of government- run media. He argues that the media is more responsive to public needs when it is subject to market forces, but believes that news reform can only advance alongside political reform. In a commentary for The Beijing News, Bai argued that insuring rationality in government was dependent on moving China further towards the rule of law. When Tibetan independence supporters disrupting the Olympic torch relay in Paris prompted calls for a boycott of French retailers in China such as Carrefour and Louis Vuitton, Bai went online to oppose a boycott. He encouraged proponents of a boycott to be calm and consider the consequences for Chinese nationals working at the affected retailers. Bai is also a member of the 21st Century Committee for China-Japan Friendship, a group that consults the two countries on policies concerning their mutual relations. Following a 2008 meeting of the group, he spoke approvingly of a speech by then Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda for emphasizing a collective view of their interests stating that \\"For Sino-Japanese relations, it is no longer the question of 'You' and 'I'. Now we are a community of interests with our feet in Asia and facing the world together.\\" Following anti-Japanese demonstrations over the East China Sea islands dispute, Bai decried acts of violence during the protests as committing crimes under the guise of patriotism. Humanitarianism Bai has served as a spokesman for efforts against HIV/AIDS in China. He was named the Image Ambassador for the AIDS Prevention Education Project for Chinese Youth following the project's establishment and served as an ambassador for the China Red Ribbon Foundation. As a CRRF ambassador, Bai attended a gala that the group organized to promote efforts against AIDS on the eve of the 25th World AIDS Day. During the gala, Bai held on-stage interviews with the Chinese Health Minister, the Executive Director of the CRRF, and the General Manager for the Global Fund. Following the Sichuan earthquake, Bai hosted a live program together with fellow CCTV hosts in order to raise funds for disaster relief. He also made a show of support for the victims when he was carrying the Olympic torch for the 2008 Olympics relay.

The oxidation state of most compounds is the group oxidation state of +2. Zinc may be classified as a post-transition main group element with zinc(II). Zinc compounds are noteworthy for their nondescript behavior, they are generally colorless (unlike other elements with the oxidation number +2, which are usually white), do not readily engage in redox reactions, and generally adopt symmetrical structures. General characteristics In its compounds, Zn2+ ions have an electronic configuration [Ar] 3d10. As such, its complexes tend to be symmetrical, ZnO and zinc sulfide, ZnS, (zincblende) in which the oxide and sulfide ions are tetrahedrally bound to four zinc ions. Many complexes, such as ZnCl42‚àí, are tetrahedral. Tetrahedrally coordinated zinc is found in metallo-enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase. Six-coordinate octahedral complexes are also common, such as the ion [Zn(H2O)6]2+, which is present when a zinc salts are dissolved in water. Five- and seven-coordination numbers can be imposed by special organic ligands. Many zinc(II) salts are isomorphous (have the same type of crystal structure) with the corresponding salts of magnesium(II). This parallel results from the fact that Zn2+ and Mg2+ have almost identical ionic radii as well as filled electron shells. That two elements so different in atomic number have the same radius is a consequence of the d-block contraction. Whilst calcium is somewhat larger than magnesium, there is a steady decrease in size as atomic number increases from calcium to zinc. Zn(II) complexes are kinetically labile, i.e. the Zn-ligand bonds exchange with other ligands rapidly. For this reason, zinc ions are at the catalytic centers in many enzymes. Zn(I) Compounds with zinc in the oxidation state +1 are extremely rare. The compounds have the formula RZn2R and they contain a Zn ‚Äî Zn bond analogous to the metal-metal bond in mercury(I) ion, Hg22+. In this respect zinc is similar to magnesium where low- valent compounds containing a Mg ‚Äî Mg bond have been characterised. Other oxidation states No compounds of zinc in oxidation states other than +1 or +2 are known. Calculations indicate that a zinc compound with the oxidation state of +4 is unlikely to exist. Colour and magnetism Zinc chloride Zinc compounds, like those of main group elements, are mostly colourless. Exceptions occur when the compound contains a coloured anion or ligand. However, zinc selenide and zinc telluride are both coloured due to charge- transfer processes. Zinc oxide turns yellow when heated due to the loss of some oxygen atoms and formation of a defect structure. Compounds containing zinc are typically diamagnetic, except in cases where the ligand is a radical. Reactivity of metallic zinc Zinc is a strong reducing agent with a standard redox potential of ‚àí0.76 V. Pure zinc tarnishes rapidly in air, rapidly forming a passive layer. The composition of this layer can be complex, but one constituent is probably basic zinc carbonate, Zn5(OH)6CO3. The reaction of zinc with water is slowed by this passive layer. When this layer is corroded by acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, the reaction proceeds with the evolution of hydrogen gas. :Zn + 2 H+ ‚Üí Zn2+ \\\\+ H2 Zinc reacts with alkalis as with acids. With oxidants such as chalcogens and halogens, Zn forms binary compounds such as ZnS and ZnCl2. Binary compounds The Wurtzite structure, showing the tetrahedral environment of both Zn and S atoms a unit cell of zincblende Zinc oxide, ZnO, is the most important manufactured compound of zinc, with a wide variety of uses. It crystallizes with the Wurtzite structure. It is amphoteric, dissolving in acids to give the aqueous Zn2+ ion and in alkali to give the zincate (a.k.a. tetrahydroxozincate) ion, [Zn(OH)4]2‚àí. Zinc hydroxide, Zn(OH)2 is also amphoteric. Zinc sulfide, ZnS, crystallizes in two closely related structures, the zincblende crystal structure and the Wurtzite crystal structure, which are common structures of compounds with the formula MA. Both Zn and S are tetrahedrally coordinated by the other ion. A useful property of ZnS is its phosphorescence. The other chalcogenides, ZnSe and ZnTe, have applications in electronics and optics. Of the four zinc halides, has the most ionic character, whereas the others, , , and , have relatively low melting points and are considered to have more covalent character. The pnictogenides (notable for its high melting point), , and , have various applications. Other binary compounds of zinc include zinc peroxide , zinc hydride , and zinc carbide . Salts Zinc nitrate (used as oxidizing agent), zinc chlorate , zinc sulfate (known as \\"white vitriol\\"), zinc phosphate (used as primer pigment), zinc molybdate (used as white pigment), zinc chromate (one of the few colored zinc compounds), zinc arsenite Zn(AsO2)2 (colorless powder) and zinc arsenate octahydrate (white powder, also referred to as koettigite) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. The latter two compounds are both used in insecticides and wood preservatives. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is zinc acetate , which has several medicinal applications. Zinc salts are usually fully dissociated in aqueous solution. Exceptions occur when the anion can form a complex, such as in the case of zinc sulfate, where the complex [Zn(H2O)n(SO4] may be formed, (log K = ca. 2.5).IUPAC SC-Database Complexes Structure of solid basic zinc acetate, [] The most common structure of zinc complexes is tetrahedral which is clearly connected with the fact that the octet rule is obeyed in these cases. Nevertheless, octahedral complexes comparable to those of the transition elements are not rare. Zn2+ is a class A acceptor in the classification of Ahrland, Chatt and Davies, and so forms stronger complexes with the first-row donor atoms oxygen or nitrogen than with second-row sulfur or phosphorus. In terms of HSAB theory Zn2+ is a hard acid. In aqueous solution an octahedral complex, [Zn(H2O)6]2+ is the predominant species.Burgess, J. Metal ions in solution, (1978) Ellis Horwood, New York. p 147 Aqueous solutions of zinc salts are mildly acidic because the aqua-ion is subject to hydrolysis with a pKa of around 9, depending on conditions.Baes, C. F.; Mesmer, R. E. The Hydrolysis of Cations, (1976), Wiley, New York :[Zn(H2O)6]2+ [Zn(H2O)5(OH)]+ \\\\+ H+ Hydrolysis explains why basic salts such as basic zinc acetate and basic zinc carbonate, Zn3(OH)4(CO3)‚Ä¢H2O are easy to obtain. The reason for the hydrolysis is the high electrical charge density on the zinc ion, which pulls electrons away from an OH bond of a coordinated water molecule and releases a hydrogen ion. The polarizing effect of Zn2+ is part of the reason why zinc is found in enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase. Structure of a monomeric zinc dialkyldithiophosphate No fluoro complexes are known, but complexes with the other halides and with pseodohalides, [ZnX3]‚àí and [ZnX4]2‚àí can be prepared. The case of the thiocyanate complex illustrates the class A character of the zinc ion as it is the N-bonded isomer, [Zn(NCS)4]2‚àíin contrast to [Cd(SCN)4]2‚àí which is S-bonded. Being a class-A acceptor does not preclude the formation of complexes with sulfur donors, as is shown by zinc dithiophosphate and the zinc finger complex (below). The zinc acetylacetonate complex, Zn(acac)2 is interesting. As the ligand is bidentate a tetrahedral structure might be expected. However, the compound is in fact a trimer, Zn3(acac)6 in which each Zn ion is coordinated by five oxygen atoms in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal structure. Other 5-coordinate structures can be engineered by choosing ligands which have specific stereochemical requirements. For example, terpyridine, which is a tridentate ligand forms the complex [Zn(terpy)Cl2]. Another example would involve a tripodal ligand such as Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine. Square pyramidal 5-coordinate Zinc is found in Tetra(4-pyridyl)porphinatomonopyridinezinc(II) Collins, D. M. ; Hoard, J. L. (1970). The Crystal Structure and Molecular Stereochemistry of Tetra(4-pyridyl)porphinatomonopyridinezinc(II). An Appraisal of Bond Strain in the Porphine Skeleton. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 92, 3761-3371. Solution studies of other 5-coordinate Zinc porphyrins have been reported. Vogel, G. C.; Bechman, B. A. (1976) \\"Binding of Pyridine to Phenyl- Substituted Derivatives of Zinc Tetraphenylporphine\\". Inorganic Chemistry, 15, 483-484 The compound zinc cyanide, Zn(CN)2, is not 2-coordinate. It adopts a polymeric structure consisting of tetrahedral zinc centres linked by bridging cyanide ligands. The cyanide group shows head to tail disorder with any zinc atom having between 1 and 4 carbon atom neighbours and the remaining being nitrogen atoms. These two examples illustrate the difficulty of sometimes relating structure to stoichiometry. A coordination number of 2 occurs in zinc amide Zn(NR1R2)2 (R1=CMe3, R2=SiMe3); the ligand is so bulky that there is not enough space for more than two of them. Bio-complexes Carbonic anhydrase: an hydroxide group (red) is shown attached to zinc (gray) Zinc finger motif. The zinc ion (green) is coordinated by two histidine residues and two cysteine residues. A very large number of metallo-enzymes contain zinc(II). Also many proteins contain zinc for structural reasons. The zinc ion is invariably 4-coordinate with at least three ligands that are amino-acid side-chains. The imidazole nitrogen of a histidine side-chain is a common ligand. The following are typical examples of the two kinds of zinc-protein complexes. In the active site of resting carbonic anhydrase a zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues. The fourth position is occupied by a water molecule, which is strongly polarized as in hydrolysis (see above). When carbon dioxide enters the active site, it subject to nucleophilic attack by the oxygen atom which carries a partial negative charge, or indeed a full negative charge if the water molecule is dissociated. The CO2 is rapidly converted into a bicarbonate ion. :[(-hys)3Zn(H2O)]2+ \\\\+ CO2 ‚Üí [(-hys)3Zn]2+ \\\\+ HCO3‚àí \\\\+ H+ Some peptidases, such as glutamate carboxypeptidase II are thought to act in a similar way, with the zinc ion promoting the formation of a nucleophilic reagent. The zinc finger motif is a rigid substructure in a protein which facilitates the binding of the protein to another molecule such as DNA. In this case all four coordination positions are occupied by the histidine and cysteine residues. The tetrahedral geometry around the zinc ion constrains an Œ± helix fragment and an antiparallel Œ≤ sheet fragment to a particular orientation with respect to each other. The magnesium ion, which has a higher concentration in biological fluids, cannot perform these functions because its complexes are much weaker than those of zinc. Organometallic compounds Diethylzinc Organozinc compounds contain zinc‚Äîcarbon covalent bonds. Diethylzinc () was first reported in 1848. It was made by reaction of zinc and ethyl iodide and is the first compound known to contain a metal‚Äîcarbon sigma bond. For a long time it was a mystery why copper(II) did not form an analogous compound. It was not until the 1980s that the reason was found: the zinc compound does not undergo the beta-hydride elimination reaction whereas the compound of the transition metal copper does so. Alkyl and aryl zinc compounds are contain the linear C‚ÄîZn‚ÄîC motif. Because the zinc centre is coordinatively unsaturated, the compounds are powerful electrophiles. In fact the low-molecular weight compounds will ignite spontaneously on contact with air and are immediately destroyed by reaction with water molecules. The use of zinc alkyls has been largely superseded by the use of the more easily handled Grignard reagents. This demonstrates yet another connection between the chemistries of zinc and magnesium. Zinc cyanide, , is used as a catalyst in some organic reactions. Organometallic compounds of zinc(I) contain M‚ÄîM bonds. Decamethyldizincocene is now known.

It was released in the US with the alternative title Dark Sands. Paul Robeson considered Jericho one of his most positive accomplishments in projecting a screen image of a Black man with courage, honor, self-sacrifice and intelligence who achieves success and happiness. Robeson's first British film, Sanders of the River, ended up being an embarrassment for the actor, its story turning into a celebration of British colonialism. Robeson felt betrayed by the production team and sought without success to buy all circulating prints. As a result, Robeson demanded artistic control over the final cut of this film. For example, the ending was to be that Jericho, homesick, agrees to help clear the captain's name in the United States. After their plane crashes in the desert, Jericho dies trying to save Captain Mack. Instead, Robeson simply requested that the movie end with the captain flying off alone. Plot A World War I American troopship is torpedoed, and many soldiers are trapped below the deck. Jericho Jackson (Robeson), a medical student drafted into the war, heroically saves the trapped men, in defiance of his superior's orders to abandon ship, but accidentally kills the officer in the melee. Despite his heroism, Jericho is court-martialed for refusing orders. Embittered, he escapes. Captain Mack is held responsible for his escape and court-martialed. Jericho ends up in North Africa, where he meets the Tuareg people. When he uses his medical skills to heal the sick, the Tuareg welcome Jericho into their tribe, and he marries and raises a family. He eventually becomes the Tuaregs' leader. He leads his people to victory over rivals and brings peace and unity to the region through which the Tuareg trek annually to trade for salt. When an anthropology film crew's coverage of the salt trek is shown in London, Captain Mack spots Jericho and vows to track him down. However, when the captain sees how much good Jericho has done for his adopted people, he relents and flies away alone. Cast * Paul Robeson as Cpl. Jericho Jackson * Henry Wilcoxon as Capt.

Born in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan.  Biography  Soji Shimada graduated from Seishikan High School in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture, and later Musashino Art University as a Commercial arts design major. After spending years as a dump truck driver, free writer, and musician, he made his debut as a mystery writer in 1981 when The Tokyo Zodiac Murders remained as a finalist in the Edogawa Rampo Prize.JLPP profile His most well-known works include the Detective Mitarai Series and the Detective Yoshiki Series. His works often involve themes such as the death penalty, Nihonjinron (his theory on the Japanese people), and Japanese and international culture. He is a strong supporter of amateur Honkaku (i.e. authentic, orthodox) mystery writers. Following the trend of Social School of crime fiction led by Seicho Matsumoto, he was the pioneer of \\"Shin-Honkaku\\" (New Orthodox) logic mystery genre. He bred authors such as Yukito Ayatsuji, Rintaro Norizuki and Shogo Utano, and he led the mystery boom from the late 1980s to present day. As the father of \\"Shin-Honkaku,\\" Shimada is sometimes referred to as \\"The Godfather of Shin-Honkaku\\" or \\"God of Mystery.‚Äù Though a grave critic and writer, Shimada is not the harsh, grim character that many imagine him to be; in fact, he is quite friendly in person. One could get a sense of his character in his humor mysteries such as Soseki and the London Mummy Murders and Let There Be Murder, Any Kind of Murder. These novels, especially the latter, involves an extravagant mystery trick as well as elements of satire, confusion, youth, and survival. These colorful themes made the novel into a great hit, and were made into a short series. In recent years, he has begun a new challenge‚Äîan animated series called the \\"Taiga Novels,\\" collaborated with the renowned illustrator Masamune Shirow. Upon its kick-off in January 2008, he and Shirow plan to create a twelve-book series through the Kodansha BOX publishers.Kodansha BOX On top of the BOX, Shimada holds a column in the celebrated magazine, the Weekly Shincho. He is also heading two newly founded Amateur Mystery Novel contests‚Äîfirst, \\"The City of Roses Fukuyama Mystery Award\\"Fukuyama Mystery Award for amateur writers in Japan, and the \\"Soji Shimada Mystery Award\\"Soji Shimada Mystery Award in Taiwan, sponsored by Crown Publishing company. Even past the age of sixty, his passion for writing has become stronger than ever: he is truly the maestro of Shin-Honkaku mystery. In 2019 he joined the curated group of award-winning Japanese authors Red Circle Authors.

Establishment The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Joint Intelligence Community Council as an Executive oversight body to the Intelligence Community. The JICC meets semiannually. To see a copy of the JICC's first meeting in pdf format, click here. Membership The Director of National Intelligence chairs the Joint Intelligence Community Council. Other members of the oversight body include: * The Secretary of State * The Secretary of the Treasury * The Secretary of Defense * The Attorney General * The Secretary of Energy * The Secretary of Homeland Security * Other officers of the United States Government designated by the PresidentJoint Intelligence Community Council Functions Advise the DNI In order to assist the Director of National Intelligence in developing and implementing a joint, unified national intelligence effort to protect national security, the Joint Intelligence Community Council serves two functions. The first function is to advise the DNI on how to most effectively establish requirements, develop budgets, manage finances, and monitor and evaluate the performance of the Intelligence Community. This list is not exhaustive, however, as the DNI may request the JICC for advisement on other matters related to national security. Ensure the Execution of Programs The second function designated to the Joint Intelligence Community Council to ensure a unified intelligence effort is to ensure the timely execution of programs, policies, and directives established by the Chairman, the DNI. Advice and opinions of members other than the Chairman The Director of National Intelligence (Chairman of the JICC) presents his/her advice and opinions gathered from the advice and opinions of the JICC to the President and National Security Council. If a dissenting member of the JICC disagrees with, or wishes to add to, the advice and opinions of the Chairman presented to the President and the National Security Council, the dissenting member may submit to the Chairman his/her opinions. If such a situation occurs, the Chairman must present the advice or opinions of the dissenting member at the same time as the Chairman presents his/hers to the President and the National Security Council. As a result, the Chairman must establish procedures to ensure that the presentation of the advice of the Chairman to the President and the National Security Council is not unduly delayed due to the submission of dissenting opinions.Intelligence Community Legal Reference Book Recommendations to Congress All members of the Joint Intelligence Community Council may present any recommendations relating to the Intelligence Community to Congress as the presenter considers appropriate. Effectiveness Positives According to Tom Ridge, former Secretary of Homeland Security, the Joint Intelligence Community Council is critical to the Intelligence Community. The Chairman of the JICC reports to the President as the head of the Intelligence Community. The JICC is critical to ensuring that the Chairman provides sound advice to the President and the National Security Council. Additionally, the JICC provides each of its members the opportunity to shape intelligence priorities.Remarks by Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge Before the House Select Committee on Homeland Security Criticisms Critics of the effectiveness of the Joint Intelligence Community Council offer two key criticisms. First, the members of the JICC, other than the Chairman, are unlikely to have the time to devote to intelligence management issues. In addition to serving on the oversight body examining intelligence, members of the JICC are also responsible for managing the Department of State, Department of the Treasury, Department of Defense, Department of Justice, etc. The second criticism against the effectiveness of the JICC is the lack of power yielded to the Chairman. In addition to the rights of all JICC member to convey their view to the President, all of the members, aside from the Chairman, have additional avenues to speak to the President separate from the JICC. This current structure challenges the power and decisions of the Chairman.Mark M.

The term psychic refers to the claimed ability to perceive information unavailable to the normal senses by what is claimed to be extrasensory perception. It is the opinion of scientific skeptics that people believe in such abilities due to cognitive biases and the use of various techniques by the practitioners, including intentional deception.Gracely, EJ.

Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi. Journal of Consciousness Studies 10: 29‚Äì50. Claims Pet psychics rely on different techniques when doing an animal \\"reading\\". These psychics allegedly communicate with animals and connect with an animal's spirit. Some claim that the readings are done by communicating with their electromagnetic energy, similar to reiki and/or therapeutic touch healing. Others claim the animal does not need to be alive or physically close to the psychic, as phone readings are sometimes done. https://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/lost-your- pet-this-self-described-psychic-s-mission-in-life-is-to-help-you-find- it-1.4810232 In the early twentieth century, the Association for Research and Enlightenment began researching paranormal and psychic abilities in humans. The first animal communicators claimed they could communicate telepathically with animals living or dead. Scientific analysis Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell reported on this topic in the Skeptical Inquirer in 2002. He reported that cold reading can explain why so many pet psychics appear to communicate with animals. Pet psychics like Gerri Leigh and Animal Planet's Sonya Fitzpatrick work in front of audiences with the pets and owners present at the same time. Although appearing to be impressive, the conclusions and pronouncements are \\"validated\\" by the pet owners and not the pets themselves. Furthermore, linguistic professor Karen Stollznow tested a pet psychic with a cat named Jed. Not only was the psychic \\"completely inaccurate in her reading of Jed's age, place of birth, background, behavior, health, and my health ...\\", she was unable to tell that Jed was not her cat. Stollznow concluded that \\"language is human-species specific. We don't and can't 'know' what animals think.\\"Stollznow, K. (2003) The Ballad of Jed (and the Pet Psychic).Skeptical Inquirer. 19.1. Skeptic Robert Todd Carroll has described the claims of pet psychics as quackery. According to Carroll \\"the king of the animal quackers has to be Rupert Sheldrake, who thinks he's proved that some pets are psychic.\\" Skeptical investigator Benjamin Radford wrote about this topic in 2012 and said: Radford also outlined a simple 3-step test that would provide proof of this claimed ability, but predicted that pet psychics would always fail such a test. He also reported that \\"The problem of pet psychics taking advantage of grieving pet owners plagues people like Dr. Wally Sife, founder of The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to providing grief counseling for people who have lost beloved animals.\\" In 2012, the hosts of the Oh No, Ross and Carrie! podcast investigated the efficacy of pet psychics and were unimpressed.Blocher, R, Poppy, C.

His first break was as Cadet Alex J. Stone in Major Payne. He and his brother Derick Martini wrote the films Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire and Lymelife. Based on experiences from the Martinis' childhood, Lymelife won the FIPRESCI award at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival. Martini is also known for being the singer/songwriter for the Los Angeles-based band The Spaceship Martini. Personal life After the release of Major Payne, Martini moved to Los Angeles to work in film and television. Derick soon followed suit, and, before long, they started making Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire, in which they play the titular brother characters. The Martini brothers have gone on to portray Alex and Morris Karnofsky in Louis, a silent film they co-wrote, based on the historical brothers who helped Louis Armstrong get his first trumpet. The story of Lymelife is based on Steven and Derick's childhood in the New York suburbs of Long Island. After the incidents of the film, Steven moved from Long Island back into his birthplace of New York City, where he attended the Professional Children's School. There, he met the Culkin brothers, who portrayed the Martini brothers on film. It was during this period that Steven met Adrianna, whose father had Lyme disease. This relationship is the basis of the love story between Rory Culkin and Emma Roberts in the film. During the Sundance Labs, Kieran Culkin played the role of Scott, which is based on Steven, and later was played by his brother Rory Culkin. Steven played Jimmy, the role eventually played by Kieran, and based on older brother Derick. Alec Baldwin played their father. His brother William Baldwin co-produced Lymelife. Career Early roles include Major Payne and the TV series Prince Street Steven's writing career began with Smiling Fish and Goat on Fire, a film he and his brother financed for $50,000 and starred as the title roles, which won the Discovery Award at the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival. Smiling Fish was co-written and directed by Steven's friend and fellow Professional Children's School alumni, Kevin Jordan. The film drew from experiences in the Martini brothers' lives. His second script, Lymelife, was accepted in the Sundance Institute's Film Program, where he and Derick shot, edited, and scored several scenes, which were reviewed by celebrity creative advisers. Some of this experience was recorded in \\"Sundance 20\\", a documentary film made by director Doug Pray. Martini is currently the singer/songwriter of The Spaceship Martini. \\"Spaceship\\" is Martini's nickname, based on his \\"out there\\" demeanor. The music of the Spaceship Martini is an ever-evolving mix of storytelling and sound, often centering on the lyrics that Martini writes. Most recently they scored Lymelife, Martini started editing Lymelife during the 22-day film shoot in New Jersey on Final Cut Pro, a program he learned during pre-production. The film's score, which was recorded under the Spaceship Martini moniker, evolved out of the editing process.

He is mostly known as the person who signed for the Soviet Union the German Instrument of Surrender on May 7, 1945. However, since he did not have an authorization from Moscow to do so, the Soviet Union insisted on signing another Act of Military Surrender near Berlin two days later. Biography The Instrument of Surrender with Susloparov's signature at the bottom. May 7, 1945German Surrender May 7, 1945German Surrender May 8, 1945 Ivan Susloparov was born in the village of Krutikhintsy, in what is today Kumyonsky District of Kirov Oblast in northeastern European Russia. He fought in the First World War as a non-commissioned officer, participated in the October Revolution of 1917, and fought in the Red Army on the Eastern and Southern Fronts of the Russian Civil War. After the Reds' victory, Susloparov stayed in the army. While in service, he graduated from Kiev's Joint Military School in 1925, and from Engineering Command Department of Dzerzhinsky Military Academy in 1938. In 1939, Susloparov was appointed as the Soviet military attach√© in Paris, where, it is said, he also was in charge of the Soviet military intelligence network in Western Europe, including the so-called Rote Kapelle organization. When General Officer ranks were introduced in the Red Army, Susloparov was made Major General; the commission was reported in the Red Star on July 12, 1940. After the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany in 1941, Susloparov served in the headquarters of the Red Army's artillery; from 1942 until the middle of 1944 he was the commander of the artillery of the 10th Army of the Western Front. In the summer of 1944 Susloparov was posted to recently liberated Paris again, as the chief of the Soviet liaison mission with the French Government and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. His moment of fame came on May 6, 1945, when Dwight D. Eisenhower informed him of the arrival of German general Alfred Jodl with the proposal of Germany's surrender. Although initially planning to surrender only to the Western Allies, the German emissary had to agree to surrender the rump Nazi forces to all allies. At Eisenhower's suggestion, Susloparov forwarded the proposed text of the surrender instrument to his superiors in Moscow, and started to wait for the authorization to sign it in the name of the USSR. No response, however, came by the scheduled signing ceremony time (2:30 AM on May 7), and General Susloparov made the decision to sign the document, but with the caveat that a new surrender ceremony would take place elsewhere if any of the allies requested it. Susloparov executed the document using the French transliteration of his name, Sousloparov, rather than Cyrillic letters. As Susloparov went to report on his actions to Moscow, he saw a freshly arrived order not to sign the surrender document. Just as Susloparov expected, the Soviet Government indeed requested a second surrender ceremony, which took place in Karlshorst near Berlin late on May 8. General Susloparov was present there as well. After the war, General Susloparov worked in the Military Diplomatic Academy in Moscow, an institution that trained military attach√©s and intelligence officers.Sherman W. Flemer, Soviet Intelligence Training His job title was described as nachalnik kursa, i.e. the officer in charge of all cadets who entered the academy in a particular year. He died on December 16, 1974, in Moscow and was buried in Vvedenskoye Cemetery.

Accessed February With the country‚Äôs National Library, the library has some of the largest holdings of materials in the Philippines.  History  The fa√ßade of the old main library building facing the red brick road of the College Lane The Ateneo's main library was first located in the Ateneo campus in Intramuros, Manila. Fathers Vicente Jim√©nez, S.J. and Jacinto Lloven, S.J. collected books and started a library. Supported by the Ayuntamiento (city government of Manila), the first Ateneo library in Intramuros served its purpose effectively for over four decades. In 1921, when the school administration passed to American Jesuits, the Ateneo library was briefly under the care of Fr. Edward Duffy, S.J. Fr. Walter J. Claffey, S.J., was appointed its first director. Claffey officially established the library in the Intramuros campus's \\"Sal√≥n de Vistas,\\" which was later called \\"Rizal Hall.\\" Fr. Walter Meagher, S.J. became director in 1922 and two years later Fr. James Moran took over. The library's collection in 1926 was the most up- to-date in Manila. In 1928, the Rizal Book Club was established with Fr. Joseph McGrath, S.J. as moderator. By 1931, the library had around 11,000 volumes but the following year, fire destroyed the campus. The fire devoured all but a handful of books. The Ateneo then transferred to Padre Faura St., still in Manila. There, the library, through the help of friends of Fr. Theodore Daigler, S.J., grew again. So that by 1935, it had built up a collection large enough for Fr. Thomas Tuite, S.J. to introduce the new Dewey Decimal classification system. Fr. John Treubig, S.J., in 1939, with 33 members of the Rizal Book Club boasted of a daily circulation of 300 in a school of less than 2,000 students. The Second World War destroyed the Ateneo's library, which was restarted by Fr. Jaime Bulatao, S.J., who introduced the Library of Congress classification system. Then Fr. John Carroll, S.J. continued the post-war effort to build the library collection. In 1952, the Ateneo moved from Padre Faura to Loyola Heights, Quezon City. Mr. Francisco Singson and Fr. Joseph Maxcy, S.J. were the central to the library's development over the next seven years. By 1959, the School's centennial year, a professional librarian, Fr. Robert J. Suchan, S.J. was appointed director. In 1967, the first library building was inaugurated with the help from Ford Foundation, alumni, and other donors. It was named Rizal Library in honor of Jos√© Rizal, an alumnus of the university and the national hero of the Philippines. The collection grew over the years. Mr. Rogelio B. Mallillin became director in 1980. His requests for an expansion of the library facilities came true in 1989 when an annex building, a three-storey building, was completed. From 1997-2001, Mr. Carmelo V. Lopez headed the Rizal Library. A Rizal Library Board was created in 1997 to serve as the chief advisory body to the Dean of School of Arts and Sciences, now the Vice President for the Loyola Schools, in all matters pertaining to the Rizal Library. Vernon R. Totanes is the current Director of the Rizal Library.

Also known as the western big-eared bat, the long-eared bat, and the lump-nosed bat, its appearance is defined by a pair of outsize ears and a lump-adorned nose. The Ozark big-eared bat is the largest and reddest of the five subspecies of Corynorhinus townsendii and is medium-sized and weighs from 0.2 to 0.5 ounces.U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service It has very large, 1-inch-long ears that connect at the base across the forehead. The snout has large, prominent lumps above the nostrils. These particular bats feed on moths and other insects; they forage along forest edges. Importance Bats are beneficial to our planet in a myriad of ways. A colony of big brown bats can eat 18 million cucumber beetles.Wild Cave National Park The insectivorous food habits of bats play an important role in maintaining a balance among insect populations.Bogan Other species of bats, especially in temperate zones, are insectivorous and collectively consume large quantities of insects.Bogan Bat droppings or guano support entire ecosystems of unique organisms, including bacteria which are useful in detoxifying wastes, as well as producing gasohol (mixture of gasoline and alcohol) and certain antibiotics. Habitat The caves used by Ozark big-eared bats are located in karst regions dominated by oak-hickory forests. Karst, a special type of landscape, is formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, including limestone and dolomite.Karst Waters Institute The temperature of hibernation caves ranges from 40 to 50 ¬∞F (4.4 to 10 ¬∞C). The Ozark big-eared bats use caves all year around, thus they are highly susceptible to extinction if their homes vary too greatly in temperature, are disturbed, or are destroyed. The Ozark big-eared bats once lived in caves in Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma,.National Geographic but they have apparently abandoned their Missouri habitat due to human encroachment and cave disturbance. Offspring Maternity colonies are located in caves that range in temperature between 50 and 59 ¬∞F (10 to 15 ¬∞C). Big-eared bats mate in the fall and store their sperm during the wintertime and at the end of hibernation, pregnancy occurs. Further reinforcing their fragile state, Ozark big-eared bats give birth to a single offspring. Because of their low birth rate, these mammals can easily become over-exploited. Young bats grow quite rapidly and are capable of flight at three weeks, and by six weeks, they are weaned from the mother. Causes of decline Concern about the conservation status of bats is developing, as many species of bats are increasingly affected by humans.Bogan Bats face multiple threats of pesticide poisoning, roost destruction and closure, habitat loss, diseases such as white nose syndrome, over-exploitation, and extermination as pests.Bogan Habitat fragmentation, a major concern, creates a disruption of extensive habitats into bat populations. The primary cause of decline is disturbance. When humans enter hibernation caves, they arouse the bats, whose metabolic rate increases. A single arousal can expend 10 to 30 days of fat reserve. This can result in death by starvation, because the bats have little extra fat reserve. Predation at the cave entrance by house cats, racoons, bobcats, and other animals has also caused significant mortality. Conservation efforts The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has established the Sequoyah/Oklahoma Bat Cave National Wildlife Refuge. In other areas, cave entrances have been fenced‚Äîto keep humans and domestic animals out of the caves but to allow bats access.

The crest within is blazoned A raven Proper and the motto is LABORA (Latin for \\"Toil\\"). Coat of arms of the Mackie of , the last known chief of Mackie Clan Mackie is a Lowland Scottish clan. The clan does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Mackie is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a recognised chief, or a chief who possessed the chiefly arms of the name; however, no one at present is in possession of such arms. Origins The clan-name Mackie is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic MacAoidh.'\\". The Gaelic personal name Aoidh is an old one and means \\"fire\\". History Clan Mackie was a prominent Galwegien family in the 16th and early 17th centuries. The Mackies of were the principal family of the clan. At the beginning of the 17th century, Sir Patrick Mackie of was one the original fifty Scottish undertakers of the plantation of Ulster. About of his lands, near Donegal, were however later taken over by John, earl of Annandale. The Mackies of acquired the lands of Bargaly in Kirkcudbrightshire and Auchencairn near Castle Douglas. Today there are still Mackies in Kirkcudbright. Symbols The arms of Mackie of is blazoned Argent, two ravens pendant from an arrow fessways piercing their necks Proper, on a chief Azure a lion passant of the Field armed and langued Gules. The origin of these arms is explained by tradition. Mackie of was to have been in the company of Robert II and was boasting of his prowess in the skill of archery. The king of Scots, growing weary of this, pointed out two ravens on a distant tree and asked Mackie of to prove his boasts. However, much to the chagrin of the King, Mackie of Large skewered both ravens with his arrow. Tradition goes on to state that because of his feat Mackie of was granted the right to bear on his shield two ravens pierced by an arrow through their neck, together with a lion which alluded to the king. The 1906 book The Book of Mackay by Angus Mackay gives the following information: According to Barbour's Metrical History of Bruce, the hunted Robert escaped from the beagles of John MacDougall in 1306 and made his way alone on foot. He arrived at an appointed trysting place near Loch Dee in Galloway where he could safely wait. He came upon a widow, Anabel, and her three sons who were very good archers, M'Kie, M'Clurg and Muiredach; they hospitably entertained the Bruce. During the night the king was joined by his brother Edward and Sir James Douglas with about 150 men. The next morning the widow's sons gave an exhibition of their prowess with the bow which greatly delighted the Bruce. With one arrow M'Kie transfixed a brace of ravens perched upon a rock, while his brother Muiredach brought down the third corbie on the wing. Bruce asked the sons to join him as he could use their skills. This incident is supposed to account for the brace of pierced ravens which find a place on the shield of M'Kie (Mackie). The arms of M'Kie of Larg were never recorded in the Lyon Register, but they are described in the Heraldic Manuscripts of Sir James Balfour as follows: Argent, two ravens pendent from an arrow fessways piercing their necks proper, on a shield azure a lion passant representation, and the crest and motto, which are respectively a raven proper and Labora. In addition later the Bruce rewarded the loyal widow and her gallant sons, who had fought for him so well, bestowing upon the family, \\"...the hassock of land 'tween Palnure and Penkill,\\" to wit, the thirty pound land of Cumloden in the parish of Minnigaff and stewartry of Kirkcudbright. Possible connection to the Clan Mackay According to historian Angus Mackay, the Mackies of Galloway may have been descended from Martin who was the third son of Iye MacHeth, 1st chief of the Clan Mackay who lived in the thirteenth century. Angus Mackay states that in the 17th century, Sir Patrick Mackie of Lairg in Galloway commanded a company of the regiment that was commanded by Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay. He also states that the idea that the Clan Mackay family of Strathnaver were related to the Mackie family of Galloway through Martin of Stathnaver was evidently accepted by Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet and that Gordon was closely acquainted with both Sir Donald Mackay of Stathnaver and Sir Patrick Mackie of Lairg, Galloway, and would have therefore gathered information from both. The Mackay of Stathnaver Blackcastle Manuscript also states that Martin of Stathnaver settled in Galloway in agreement with Sir Robert Gordon. Angus Mackay also notes the similarities in the coats of arms of the Mackay of Aberach branch of the Strathnaver Mackays and the Galloway Mackies. Sir Donald Mackay, 1st Lord Reay and Sir Patrick Mackie of Lairg, Galloway, both signed themselves as Mackie. Angus Mackay concludes that the Mackie form of the name was common in both Strathnaver (Clan Mackay territory) and in Galloway, but that the majority of those named Mackie would have been from Galloway.

Lieutenant William Ross chose to transfer to the Nova Scotia Fencible Infantry while in Quebec.Trask, p. 33 After the war, upon their return to Nova Scotia, the Ross family again survived the sinking of their ship off the coast of Green Island (Jeddore Ledges, Nova Scotia). The Fencibles were disbanded on 25 July 1816. Two weeks later, on 7 August 1816, William Ross led 172 former soldiers who were given land grants along the newly burned road between Chester and Kentville, Nova Scotia. Six years later on 2 May 1822, William Ross died suddenly at the age of 39. Four months later, his wife Mary gave birth to their fourth child.Trask, pp. 34-35 William‚Äôs son Edward Ross kept a diary for most of his life. The Ross Farm Museum is based on the diaries Edward wrote when he was a young man age 22-28 (1835-1841). During this time on the farm he sold produce from the local community in his store and also made a trip by boat from Chester to Halifax every spring. He was also a justice of the peace.Trask, p. 35 At age 28, Edward left the community and married Marie three years later at Cornwallis, Nova Scotia (1844).Trask, p. 35 At age 52, Edward spent time in jail for not being able to pay his debts (1865).Trask, p. 36 Five years later he went to Boston in search of work. While there, he heard the famous Lucy Stone speak at the Massachusetts State House(1872). They returned to Kentville, Nova Scotia until Marie died (1882). Edward lived for twelve more years. His final three years were spent on Ross Farm, where he died in 1894 at the age of 81.Trask, p. 36 References Texts *Deborah Trask. The Edward Ross Diaries.

It is one of the seven public high schools in the city and has an enrollment of about 1200http://www.usaschoolinfo.com/school/lincoln-high-school-yonkers-new- york.65609/enrollment students. The front portion of the building was opened in 1953 as Southeast Yonkers Jr., Sr. High School with grades 6 through 8. It was completed in 1955 and renamed Lincoln Junior-Senior High School the following year. After the first year, 6th grade was dropped and 9th grade added and when the building was completed it became Lincoln Junior-Senior High School, enrolling grades 7 through 12. In the late 1970s, the junior high grades were removed, and the school became a four-year, grade 9-12, high school. It was not named for United States President Abraham Lincoln. The school was named Lincoln High School after the Lincoln Park area of Yonkers where it is located. The first graduating class, which went continuously from 6th grade to 12th grade, graduated in 1960. A very high percentage of that class went on to college and several of its graduates returned to Lincoln as teachers. The school colors are purple and white. Its mascot is a knight holding a lance, and its athletic teams are known as the Lincoln Lancers. Both colors and mascot were chosen by the class of 1960.  Ninth and tenth grade academies  Students are taught by a team of designated core area teachers using an interdisciplinary instruction method. The school provides a rich variety of academic support including study skills training, personalized learning, and individual counseling. Academy of Finance The Academy of Finance is a specialized high school program that prepares students for careers in the financial services industry through coursework and on-the-job experience. Because of growth in the financial services industry, many firms face an overwhelming need for more qualified employees. The Academy of Finance at Lincoln High School, in partnership with the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce, works to fill local employment needs by preparing students for careers in the financial services industry. Developed in 1982 by American Express and the New York Public Schools, the program was initiated in Yonkers in 1989. Academy students complete a four-year curriculum that includes courses in: Computer Technology, Word Processing/Spread Sheets/DataBase Design, Power Point Presentations/Web Page Design, Accelerated Accounting, Economics, E-Commerce, Entrepreneurship, Financial Planning, Banking and Credit, Public Speaking, College Electives, and Insurance. Additionally, students learn office dress codes and etiquette, resume preparation, and interview skills. In 2009-2010, The Academy graduated 44 seniors who were awarded over $2.5 million in scholarships.  Academy of Finance Advisory Board  Lincoln High School's Academy of Finance has an Advisory Board whose mission is to sustain and support the development of Yonkers' youth in their quest for personal and academic success in high school, in higher education, and throughout their career. The Advisory Board consists of corporate personnel, representatives from institutions of higher learning, representatives from community-based non-profits, local and regional government representatives, and small-business owners and employees who offer supplemental resources to the Academy. The Advisory Board provides classroom speakers, mentors, job-shadowing venues, funding for programs, and paid internships for Academy students.  Arts Academy  The Arts Academy offers majors in instrumental music, vocal music, stagecraft, and visual arts. Students have the opportunity to learn from renowned visiting artists as well as participate in activities at performing art centers such as the Manhattan Theater Club, the Lincoln Center Institute, and S.U.N.Y. Purchase. The faculty of the Arts Academy all have a background as professional performers and artists as well as having strong academic backgrounds. Students from the Arts Academy demonstrated their excellence by winning 7 National Gold Awards in a competition held in Nashville, Tennessee.  Pre-Teaching and Educational Services Academy  In the Pre-Teaching and Educational Services Academy, college-bound students are prepared for post- secondary study that can lead to professional certification in teaching, psychology, social work, counseling, and related fields. Students study both traditional and Montessori teaching methods using state-of-the-art technology and electronic information systems. In addition, practical training experiences during the school year and paid summer internships and mentoring are offered in collaboration with local colleges, universities, and The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. There is also an affiliation with ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Students, Tomorrow‚Äôs Teachers‚Äù program which mentors students through college to prepare them for future careers in teaching.

ALSHS facilitates the estimated 600 worldwide Recovery International meetings and all projects formerly run by the Abraham Low Institute including the Power to Change program. The organization is named after Abraham Low, founder of the mental health self-help organization now known as Recovery International.  History  Recovery, Inc., often referred to simply as Recovery, was officially formed November 7, 1937, by neuropsychiatrist Abraham Low in Chicago, Illinois. Low created the organization to facilitate peer support self-help groups for former mental patients and later allowed for participation of those who had not been hospitalized, but with a desire to improve their mental health. During the organization's annual meeting in June 2007 it was announced that Recovery, Inc. would thereafter be known as Recovery International. As of 2008 there were over 600 weekly Recovery International meetings held throughout North America, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Israel and India. The Abraham Low Institute was founded in 1989 to develop programs, in addition to Recovery, based on Low's self-help principles. The Institute awarded grants to further scholarly research on Low's work, provided research resources for people interested in Low's methods, and developed the Power to Change program and The Relatives Project. On January 1, 2008 Recovery International merged with The Abraham Low Institute and provisionally renamed the new organization Recovery International / The Abraham Low Institute (RI/TALI). Celinda Jungheim, a community volunteer from Los Angeles, was elected as president of the Board of Directors. Abraham Low Self-Help Systems was incorporated on January 1, 2009, completing the merger of Recovery International and The Abraham Low Institute. Abraham Low Self-Help Systems is now the provider of Recovery International community, phone and online meetings and The Power to Change program, which was a program of The Abraham Low Institute.  The Relatives Project  The Relatives Project, found in 1993, provides support for family and friends of people who have mental and emotional problems. The Relatives Project teaches coping skills and stress management through meetings similar to those held in Recovery International groups, but using literature written by Abraham Low specifically for the families of his patients. Relatives are taught to maintain empathy and unconditional positive regard for their ill relative, while reframing their domestic environment to provide an empowering atmosphere for all members. The Relatives Project groups are open to adults and teenagers, and allow professionals to observe but only to participate if it is in support of a family member's mental health. Mental health becomes a shared goal for a family, and all family members share in responsibility to achieve it.  Power to Change  Power to Change is a cognitive-behavioral peer-to- peer program based on Low's self-help principles. Power to Change primarily teaches at-risk students and ex-prisoners principles of Low's Self-Help system in peer-to-peer groups. Power to Change groups generally consist of 8-12 members, meeting weekly, who learn the principles of the Low Self-Help System by describing their personal experience of disturbing events and commenting on each other's experiences using a highly structured format. Specifically, Power to Change consists of five components: # a peer-to-peer process intended to provide a safe environment for members to disclose their experiences to a supportive group, # a meeting structure intended to keep discussion on topic, # a four-part format to help members frame their experiences as useful examples, and # group feedback utilizing a set of tools (principles of Abraham Low's therapeutic technique). The four-part example consists of an objective description an event; a report of the feelings, sensations, thoughts, and impulses experienced in the members mind and body; how the member used the Power to Change tools to manage the experience; and a self-endorsement to remind the member of the progress made and to reward their effort. The Power to Change groups use much of the language suggested in the Recovery International program, such as identifying \\"temper\\" and avoiding judgment of right and wrong. The W. K. Kellogg Foundation has provided grants for Power to Change since 2003. The most recent grant was awarded in November 2008, and will provide funding until November 2010.  Chicago Public Schools  In 2007 Urban Networks Associates (UNA) conducted an evaluation of Power to Change as it was implemented in seventeen secondary and middle schools in the Chicago Public School system. In each school 12-24 group sessions were held and facilitated by either staff from the Abraham Low Institute or by a local facilitator trained by the Abraham Low Institute. Participating students showed significant improvement in prosocial behavior as measured by pre- testing and post-testing of emotional intelligence, specifically increasing self-restraint and decreasing violent behaviors. Although statistically significant, the effect sizes of changes were low or medium. UNA's SEM evaluation of the Power to Change logic model, the required steps and conditions for the program to be effective, found it fit the data collected well. To improve the effectiveness of the program UNA recommended improving communication with and training of local facilitators, encouraging students to develop plans to apply program tools outside of the group, updating the literature used to make it more age appropriate for the young students, adding activities to encourage confidentiality of what was said in group meetings and developing more interactive activities to teach program concepts. UNA also suggested asking for a commitment from participating schools to guarantee facilities were always available and that students would not be prohibited from attending group sessions.

The class was initially constructed as an unpowered, locomotive hauled coach for suburban operations, but were designed to be rebuilt into self-propelled units as electrification plans were realized. The first of these self-propelled cars were placed in service with the PRR subsidiary Long Island Rail Road with DC propulsion in 1908 and soon spread to the Philadelphia-based network of low frequency AC electrified suburban lines in 1915. Eventually the cars came to be used throughout the railroad's electrified network from Washington, DC to New York City and Harrisburg, PA. The ubiquitous cars became a commuting tradition during their long years of service in several major cities.Cudahy (2003), p. 231 and were known as \\"red cars\\" or \\"red rattlers\\".Hulick, p. 19. The cars ran in service with the PRR until the Penn Central merger in 1968 at which point they were already being marked for replacement by new technology railcars such as the Budd M1 and Pioneer III. After the bankruptcy of the Penn Central the remaining MP54s found themselves being operated by Conrail under contract with local commuter rail authorities. The last MP54 cars were retired in 1980-81 while engaged in Philadelphia suburban service with SEPTA.  Steel suburban cars  In 1906, during the PRR construction project to build tunnels under the Hudson and East Rivers and build Penn Station, the PRR announced that all new passenger cars would be made of steel and that wooden cars would not be allowed in the tunnels due to the hazard of fire.Baer, August 11, 1906. A design for a steel suburban car with a passenger compartment, overall length, and 72 seats was already under development,Baer, July 1906 along with one for a corresponding passenger-baggage combination car. Anticipating that many of the cars would eventually be used in electrically powered multiple-unit (MU) services, the cars were designed to accommodate electrical equipmentBall, p. 65. and were designated MP54 where the M is for motor and the P is for passenger.PRR Classification of Cars 1938. Additional types of these cars were developed, all with the same overall length, body shape, and characteristic round end windows often referred to as porthole or owl-eyed windows and large roof-level headlights.Staufer (1993), pp. 496, 504 The passenger-baggage combination cars (52 seats) were designated MPB54. In 1911, baggage cars with 62 ft. baggage compartments were added and designated MB62. In 1913, baggage-mail cars with the same dimensions were added and designated MBM62. In 1914, passenger- baggage combination cars with longer baggage compartments and 40 seats were added and designated MPB54B. In 1915, passenger-baggage-mail combination cars with 24 seats were added and designated MPBM54.  Early DC MP54's  The first group of MP54 cars was delivered to the PRR subsidiary Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) in 1908 which was already operating a 650-volt DC electrified service to terminals on Long Island with its fleet of MP41 cars.Baer, November 2008 Some were used for a while in non-electrified service until the East River tunnels were completed allowing service into Penn Station. Simultaneously, the same electrical system was being installed for use in the Hudson River tunnels and west to Manhattan Transfer, just east of Newark for use by the PRR proper. Between 1908 and 1915 the LIRR received a total of 225 MP54 type DC powered coaches and 65 other powered MP54-type cars. To supplement these, between 1915 and 1927 a total of 230 T-54 class trailer cars were added to the fleet along with a further 320 DC powered coaches between 1920 and 1927. Finally in 1930 a final batch of 45 MP54 coaches were delivered resulting in a total fleet of 626 Coaches, 15 baggage cars, 52 combines and 230 unpowered trailers for a grand total of 923 MP54 type cars in service on the LIRR. The LIRR MP54 coaches came in three general styles. Classes MP54, MP54A and MP54A1 were delivered with a \\"railroad\\" style clerestory roof. Classes MP54B and MP54C were delivered with a smooth, \\"arch\\" roof. Finally the MP54D and MP54D1 classes were former steam coaches converted to electric operation with clerestory roofs. Unlike the later PRR cars, the LIRR units were primarily constructed by American Car and Foundry with a few made by Pressed Steel Car Company or Standard Steel Car Company. In 1910 the PRR received its first group of MP54-type cars. Six of the coaches and two of the combination cars were provided with DC electrical equipment, and the rest were for service in trains pulled by steam or electric locomotives.Staufer (1962), p. 102, 136, 138. Penn Station opened September 8, 1910, with service to Long Island points being provided by LIRR MP54 cars.Cudahy (2003) PRR service began November 29, 1910 primarily using electric locomotives. The eight electrified PRR MP54 cars were used for shuttle service between Penn Station and Manhattan Transfer to connect with PRR trains going to or from Exchange Place in Jersey City. This shuttle service ended in 1922, and the cars were sent to the LIRR.Cudahy (2002), p. 47. In addition to the cars built for the PRR and LIRR the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad (which later became part of the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines) received a small fleet of 18 650 V DC powered MP54 cars for use on its electrified interurban line between Camden, Millville and Atlantic City in 1912. These cars, officially classified as MP54D, came equipped with both third rail and also trolley poles for the segments of the line that made use of overhead lines. These cars were used until electrified service on the PRSL was ended in 1949.MP54d diagram  AC Cars for PRR Suburban Service  In late 1912, PRR engineers recommended large-scale electrification of PRR lines with alternating current (AC) at 11,000 volts and 25 cycles, starting with the suburban service along the Main Line between Philadelphia and Paoli.Baer, December 31, 1912 This project was authorized soon thereafter.Baer, March 12, 1914 In 1914 the PRR started adding AC electrical equipment to 93 MP54-type cars at the Altoona shopsStaufer (1962), p. 10 for use in this service. Each car received a pantograph, a transformer, a power truck, a motorman's cab and controls at each end, and MU circuits. These cars were then designated MP54E to distinguish them from non- electrified cars. The Paoli line opened with electrical service in 1915 with great success, and other Philadelphia suburban lines were electrified in succeeding years. By 1933 the entire PRR line from Philadelphia to Penn Station had been provided with AC electrification and the lines from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. and Harrisburg were subsequently electrified as well. MP54 cars then provided local service throughout this area. Large numbers of MP54 MU cars were obtained both by electrifying existing non- electrified MP54 cars and by purchasing and building entirely new cars. As improved electrical equipment was developed in later years, a numeral was added to signify the type of this equipment.MP54E5 diagram Between 1926 and 1930 a further 144 cars were delivered from PRRs main shops in Altoona, PA and Standard Steel in the class MP54E2. Between 1932 and 1937 a total of 46 married pairs were constructed by Altoona that consisted of an unpowered trailer (designated T) that was towed by a motor car (designated E3), with 736 total horsepower compared with the normal 400: 34(MP54E3+MP54T) + 4(MP54E3+MBM62T) +8(MPB54BE3+MP54T).James These special trailer motors could be identified by a small golden keystone above the number on the side of the car. They also had larger louvers on the side due to the greater demand for cooling air. In time the need to change the car designations to distinguish between the non-electrified and electrified cars other than by adding an E became apparent, and it was decided to make the initial M be a \\"small\\" capital letter for the non-electrified cars.PRR Classification of Cars 1931 Small capital letters are awkward to use, so many booksBezillaCudahy have used the LIRR scheme of omitting the initial M for the non-electrified cars (P54) while less commonly a lower-case m is used instead of the small capital (mP54).index to PRR Classification of Cars 1931 In 1950, faced with the need for expensive new equipment for unprofitable suburban service,Bezilla, pp. 189, 193-195. the PRR decided to extend the life of the MP54 cars instead of buying new equipment. The MP54s were rebuilt at PRR's Wilmington, DE electric shops with an initial batch of fifty cars in the class MP54E5.Volkmer, p. 108. A follow- up batch of 50 508 hp cars in the class MP54E6 were rebuilt at the Altoona shops. (For unknown reasons, the designation MP54E4 was skipped.) In addition to the new, more powerful propulsion gear, other new equipment was installed including roller bearing equipped equalized trucks, new windows, and recessed transit-type lightingStaufer (1968), p. 169 In 1951 there were a total of 481 AC MP54 cars of all types in service,Multiple Unit Equipment in Service as of January 15, 1951, (PRR document) consisting of 405 MP54, 42 MP54T, 10 MPB54B, 9 MPB54, 7 MB62, 4 MBM62, and 4 MBM62T cars.  Performance  While state of the art in 1908, when the last brand new MP54 rolled off the assembly line 28 years later, the design did more to suit the PRR's desire for standardization than the comfort of the passengers that rode them. Each motor car was powered by a single truck at the pantograph end which in turn was equipped with two 25 Hz series wound AC motors. Using AC motors of this type resulted in poor acceleration compared to equivalent DC motors, a problem that was exacerbated by the frequent stops the MP54s would make in local commuter service. While the 99 1950's rebuilt E5 and E6 units had better performance and a stated top speed of 65 mph, older E1 and E2 cars would struggle to reach . A further design flaw in the propulsion gear of the E1 and E2 models required that if power was taken off at speeds above , it could not be reapplied until the train slowed back to 30 mph lest arcing damage the motors.PRR Electric Operations Rulebook CT290 The 1908 truck design provided little in the way of ride quality, and friction bearings on unmodified cars retarded performance further. Noise from the primitive toothed gear drivetrain (a characteristic common to contemporary MU cars on other railroads) could become quite loud at high speed which made the relative quiet of unpowered trailer cars (if utilized) attractive to some regular riders.  Service history  MP54s in Philadelphia suburban service at Wilmington, Delaware The MP54 cars ran from 1915 until 1981 on many lines, through many years of PRR service and into Penn Central, Conrail, New Jersey Department of Transportation, and then SEPTA and New Jersey Transit service. They wore several PRR Tuscan paint schemes as well as Dark Green with white lettering in PC times and a few were painted in white with blue and red stripes during the SEPTA era. Three cars transported train crews and other railroad employees from Washington, D.C.'s Union Station to the Ivy City yards in the blue and white scheme of the Washington Terminal. The MU coaches were assigned to commuter service along both the Keystone Corridor on the Main Line and the Northeast Corridor. They were also found on the Perth Amboy and Woodbridge Railroad taking passengers to and from South Amboy, New Jersey where the New York and Long Branch Railroad began. A set of MP54 cars also served as the shuttle between Princeton JunctionVolkmer, pp. 86-87.Treese, pp. 28-30.Bianculli, pp. 53-58. and Princeton, and was known to generations of Princeton students, faculty, residents and visitors as the \\"dinky\\" or the \\"PJ&B;\\" (Princeton Junction and Back). For many years a single car was used on a run between South Amboy and Trenton via Jamesburg, mainly to transport High School students. For popular events, particularly the Army-Navy football games in Philadelphia, MP54 cars were used to make up some of the special trains to provide the needed transportation.Volkmer, photo, p. 105 During World War II, the PRR was often short of passenger equipment on weekends so trains of MP54 cars were used as advance sections of long-distance trains in the electrified PRR area.Staufer & Pennypacker, p. 169. During these years the PRR also used solid trains of MB62 and MBM62 cars to carry express from Penn Station to various locations. In the days of Penn Central the MP54s ventured onto former New Haven tracks solely during railfan charters, in particular a June 14, 1970 fantrip from Penn Station to New Haven which included the New Canaan Branch. Steam-hauled P54 cars served well into the 1950s alongside their MU siblings. While these cars were more commonly seen in commuter service in the Pittsburgh area, they were also used over the entire PRR and perhaps even off-line in troop train service during World War II. Also during this time, several combine style cars were converted to completely coach seating by the addition of seats and porthole windows to the baggage and mail sections.Staufer (1993), p. 378 Two of these converted cars were sold to the Buffalo Creek and Gauley Railroad after the war. Conrail-operated units entering Washington Union Station in March 1978 At some point during the Penn Central era, several cars were de-motored and used in commuter service behind a GG1 locomotive. A single pantograph was retained on one of the cars to provide heat and lights.

These were still of wooden construction, but came with stronger steel ends, had passenger compartments 46 ft. long, overall length 55 ft., 58 seats, and were otherwise similar to the MP54 design. Later some of the original all- wooden MP1 cars were upgraded with steel ends matching the MP2 cars.Railroad electrification in the United States The Hudson and Manhattan Railroad obtained some cars with porthole windows in 1911, designated MP38, for their line to Newark. The cars were partly owned by PRR, were painted in PRR colors, had passenger compartments, overall length, 44 seats, and had additional center-entrance doors. The H&M; cars not operated over PRR trackage to Newark had the more common square windows. Cudahy (2002), pp. 42, 101.  Notes   References  * * Distributed by W. W.

It is a residential district located three miles (4.8 km) west-northwest of Charing Cross and borders the north side of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Bayswater was initially named Sandy Beaches.

It also was used extensively by the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia, in a similar fashion to the PRR. The Canadian Pacific Railway used it historically and painted its luxury revival cars in this color. It is also a Prismacolor colored pencil. History Tuscan red was the signature color of the Pennsylvania RailroadThe first recorded use of Tuscan red as a color name in English was in the early 1800s (exact date uncertain).Maerz and Paul A Dictionary of Color New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 206; Color Sample of Tuscan Red: Page 37 Plate 7 Color Sample L8‚ÄîThe color shown above in the color box at the head of the article matches the color sample in the book. The color was popular in the late 19th century but non-standardized. It became the ‚Äòsignature color‚Äô of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which instituted specifications for its formulation. Before the 1880s, pigments extracted from Brazil wood were used in its manufacture, but these proved inadequate in terms of hiding power and stability. A 1916 US National Bureau of Standards circular describes it as based on Indian red, which derives its color from iron oxides. The color was then modified by treatment with an alizarin lake pigment. The pigment‚Äôs stability lent itself to hard use in applications such as rail cars and machinery. Lower-cost imitations were made without iron oxides by using gypsum or whiting as a base and adding aniline dyes. Variations The traditional color Tuscan red is shown above. The lighter tones of Tuscan red tend toward tan and beige. The darker tones of Tuscan red tend toward purplish tones. These purplish tones of Tuscan red are exemplified by the color deep Tuscan red, shown below. Tuscan Displayed at right is the color Tuscan.

Blandford originally included the present day communities of New Harbour, Upper Blandford, and Deep Cove.  History   Origins  Between 1767-1769, the English from the west country settled Blandford, naming the community after Blandford Forum.p.6 One of the first settlers of Blandford was George Casper Zinck (c.1764 - ), the son of a German-speaking immigrant. George first lived in Lunenburg and then after the American Raid on Lunenburg (1782) during the American Revolution, George moved to nearby Rose Bay before finally settling in Blandford at the age of 20 (1784). He married and then had his first child the following year. Along with English and German settlers, there were also Jewish settlers to Blandford. More likely at least some of the Jewish family Levy in this part of Nova Scotia are descended from Nathaniel Levy who was in Halifax by 1759. After his first wife died in 1771 he moved from Halifax to Chester where he married again 1773 (Susannah Tufts). They had four children before he died in May 1787 at Chester. One of his sons, Gershom, married in 1796 (Catherine Barbara Graves). They had three sons before he died in 1801 at Chester. Two of his sons, David (born 1797) and Nathan (born 1798) settled in Tancook Island during the early nineteenth century. There descendants migrated to Blandford. Nathaniel Levy was the son of Nathan Levy, a Jewish merchant who was in Philadelphia in 1746 (Punch, 1981). Nathaniel Levy may have been in the colony to oversee the interests of the firm Levy and Frank of Philadelphia, one of the firms that provided the new colony with supplies and credit (Fergusson, 1971:46). The village of Deep Cove was first settled by John (Johannes) Meisner (1789-1872) and John Seaburg (Seaboyer) in 1838. John Meisner owned the first gristmill which was built on the north side of Deep Cove. Meisner's Point on the Upper Blandford road still retains his name. The person who Mathias Hill, Bovens Lake, and Jimmy's Island in Deep Cove is named after is unknown. When settlers first arrived at Blandford, in the winter they were able to walk over the ice to Tancook and to Chester. In 1845, Charles Lordly, Esq had goods hauled from Shoal Cove (Blandford) by three pairs of oxen and two horses over the ice to Tancook. The ice was cut with axes to a depth of two feet without finding water. The following month he had molasses and barrels of four hauled over the ice to Chester. Mr. Arch Zinck reported the last time people were able to walk to Tancook over the ice was 1932.  Fenian Raids  To ward off the threat of possible Fenian raids (1866‚Äì71), a volunteer regiment was raised in Blandford.Lily M. Zinck. Echoes of Deep Cove. Norstead Farm Press. p. 2 The troop of men did drills on what was once the field of Morton Publicover (Civic #?). Among these men were Jim Gates, George Roast and Will Gates. The Fenian movement sought to bring about Irish independence from Britain. At the end of the American Civil War, Fenians in the United States determined to recruit veterans of the war, invade and capture Canada, and force Britain to negotiate the independence of Ireland. There were a number of alarms in 1865, 1866 and 1870. There was a medal given for service in the Volunteer Regiments. Regimental troops were raised in every county across Nova Scotia. While New Brunswick and Ontario did sustain attacks, Nova Scotia did not. Perhaps to amplify the importance of the local regiment, folklore in the community includes a story of a Fenian attack by sea at Big Cove that was thwarted by the Mi'kmaq.  Cyrus Eaton  Cyrus Eaton Gravesite of his ashes, Deep Cove, Nova Scotia One of the most renowned people to make Deep Cove their home was Cyrus Eaton, a millionaire industrialist, who was originally from Pugwash, Nova Scotia, but lived in Ohio. He bought a large piece of land in Blandford between 1931 ‚Äì 1933. The estate covered woodland, run-down farms, and a number of lakes. Mr. Eaton turned this estate into a sanctuary for Canada Geese. The Canada Geese still remain here all winter and can often be seen walking down the road or swimming just off shore. In the 1950s, a successful banker, businessman and philanthropist, Cyrus Eaton, was raising Mallard ducks and Canada geese in the vicinity of Hollahan Lake. In 1959 the area became a wildlife sanctuary where these birds could feed undisturbed. Hunting of waterfowl and game birds was prohibited. In 2007 it became a protected area under the Special Places Protection Act, giving the sanctuary the province's highest level of protection of plants and animals. Access is restricted to visitors on foot. The reserve contains a wide variety of habitats and is home to some rare lichens, mosses, and vascular plants, not the least of which is an extensive Jack Pine barrens. Blandford Nature Reserve is the province's 16th nature reserve and is the first of its kind in Lunenburg County. In an address to the Empire Club of Canada (1950), Cyrus S. Eaton was introduced with the following: :Mr. Eaton also owns and operated a 3,000-acre farm near Chester, Nova Scotia, and an 870-acre farm at Northfield, Ohio, specializing in the raising of pure bred and registered Scotch Shorthorn cattle. I rather suspect that of all his undertakings Mr. Eaton has a very special interest in farming because our invitation to address this meeting reached him at his farm in Nova Scotia and, in his very welcome and very prompt reply accepting our invitation, he did say that the invitation had reached him \\"at my Deep Cove Farm in Chester, Nova Scotia, where 8 of my grandchildren and I are getting acquainted with our latest crop of Shorthorn calves. Both the children and the calves are good to look at\\".http://speeches.empireclub.org/60606/data Mr. Eaton entertained extensively during the summer when he resided in Blandford. Many of his guests were celebrities; one such guest was Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. He donated money for the doors of St. Bartholmus Church in Blandford. He had his ashes buried in Blandford (and Pugwash, Nova Scotia). At his death in 1979, his estate was purchased by a group of businessmen from Germany.

Endogamous religious cultures may have certain opposition to interfaith marriage and ethnic assimilation, and may assert prohibitions against the conversion (\\"marrying out\\") of one their own claimed adherents. Conversely, they may require the marital conversion of those who wish to marry one of their adherents. Christianity Catholicism Historically, in the case of the Catholic Church, Catholics were obligated to marry only other Catholics (including those of the Eastern Rite), and marital conversion of the non-Catholic party was considered almost obligatory. However, it was permissible for a Catholic to marry an Independent/Old Catholic (who is not in communion with Rome) or non-Catholic baptized in a manner recognized by the Catholic Church as valid (i.e., mainline Christians such as Episcopalians or Lutherans, and Eastern Orthodox), but a dispensation had to be granted by a bishop and the non-Catholic party had to agree to raise the children as Catholics. Marriage to unbaptized persons, meaning all non-Christians and members of some Christian denominations (such as Unitarians or Mormons), was forbidden. Civil marriage can be the only alternative if a religious wedding is not possible under these circumstances. Iglesia ni Cristo The Iglesia ni Cristo, a non-trinitarian church that is the largest indigenous Christian denomination in the Philippines, requires non-adherents marrying members to convert to the religion prior to the wedding. Conversely, members found to have married outside of the religion are automatically expelled from the church. A church wedding is required after the civil one. Hinduism Hinduism has allowances for such practice even if Hinduism considers all religions are a way to God, but there can be political differences and so marital conversion is sometimes discouraged. Throughout Hindu history, interreligious marriages have also been a way for keeping the peace and building alliances. Islam In general, Islam allows for marriage between a man and woman as \\"believers\\". Culturally, it is accepted that marriage between a follower of islam (muslim) and a Christian or Jew does not require conversion. Traditionally, however, marriages between muslims and a follower of Hinduism or other polytheistic religions requires conversion to Islam. Although, there are no official conversion rules, similar to Jewish laws of Halakkah (for marriage), Islamic marriage laws are generally guided by traditional interpretations. The only requirement in marriage and conversion is that the children from that marriage be raised as \\"believers,\\" a common Islamic term for Muslims. The Qur'anic verses generally quoted are:http://quran.com/ : : Judaism Jewish views on religious conversion due to intermarriage are largely in opposition to such marriage even if such marriages are tolerated. If a non-Jew wishes to become a Jew, in the sense that they practice Judaism and thus are accepted as a Jew, they are, depending on the Jewish religious tradition, typically welcome. On the other hand, if a Jew desires to leave Judaism, they are regarded as apostates or \\"assimilators\\" into a non-Jewish religion or culture. Non-Jewish cultures, tend to be regarded and portrayed as negative; being idolatrous, or rejecting of God (as Jews conceive God). Some Jewish leaders have called Jewish intermarriage a \\"Silent Holocaust,\\" particularly in 20th-21st century America where as many as 47% of American Jews have intermarried with non-Jews in past two decades. Such cultural and religious assimilation is said to represent a slow destruction of the Jewish people. Others have expressed a different view, accepting or tolerating such marriages, instead focusing their attention towards the concept that the children of a Jewish parent be raised Jewish, with some sense of their identity rooted in Judaism and in Jewish culture. However, some children of a Jewish parent were raised in the non-Jewish parent's religion while maintaining a sense of Jewish ethnicity and identity.

The live show was designed with all songs written by Ng·ªçc ƒê·∫°i and lyrics from poems of Vi Th√πy Linh.

There was a scandal of copyright dispute between Ha and H·ªìng Nhung in respect of song- \\"Det tam gai\\" (Weaving Tam Gai), Ngoc Dai then stopped Hong Nhung to perform this song. However, in December 2001, Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c was hindered by the Performance Administration because the lyrics was so \\"sexy\\" that they may \\"cause bad effects to the culture and ethic of Vietnamese music\\" (said Mr. L√™ Nam ‚Äì Director of the Administration). Therefore, the album was delayed to remove and amend its lyrics; 2 songs ‚Äì \\"T·ª± T√¨nh\\" and \\"M∆°\\" (Dreaming) used to be the starting songs in this concept album with marvelous melody were removed; the lyrics of 2 songs \\"C√¢y n·ªØ tu\\" and \\"ƒê·ª´ng h√°t t√¨nh ca du m·ª•c n·ªØa\\" (Don't sing the nomad's love song) .

Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c was one concept album, with a completed story. 7 songs expressed 7 stories told by a girl in love with her desperation, doubt, regret and obsession. Right after release, Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c made a shock to Vietnam's music with its strange and new trend, including lyrics, melody, performance art and arrangement. This show became a special music event and was voted by presses as one of the cultural phenomenon of 2002, a great landmark of innovation in music original style and performance in Vietnam. In additions, the existence of Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c oriented the music audiences in Vietnam to be interested in music harmony, arrangement and mix of an album. Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c was also an important step in the career of Ha Tran, causing prominent development of her style: Stronger, Special and Diversity. As from Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c, Ha was called as one of 4 divas of Vietnamese music. Nevertheless, after success of the first show, the dispute arose among the members of the show, Ng·ªçc ƒê·∫°i ‚Äì Tr·∫ßn Thu H√† ‚Äì Vi Thu·ª≥ Linh. As a result, after Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c 1, Tr·∫ßn Thu H√† announced on the press that she quit Nhat thuc. Ng·ªçc ƒê·∫°i continued with his own Nh·∫≠t th·ª±c 2 in 2003, without Ha Tran and Vi Thu·ª≥ Linh, but there were many stars of Vietnam such as: Thanh Lam, H·ªì Qu·ª≥nh H∆∞∆°ng, Linh Dung, T√πng D∆∞∆°ng, Kh√°nh Linh, Ng·ªçc Khu√™‚Ä¶ However, \\"Nhat Thuc 2\\" live concert and the album (sold at special price of VND 6000, equal to about USD 0.5) did not get any success as the first one. 2002‚Äì04: Thanh Lam ‚Äì H√† Tr·∫ßn In October 2002, H√† Tr·∫ßn and M·ªπ Linh went to San Jose, California, USA for a charity show.

Introduced in 2008, the neologism reflected the policy approach introduced by the Obama administration, which regarded the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan as having a single, dominant political and military situation that required a joint policy in the War on Terror. Following sharp criticism from Pakistan, condemning the hyphenation of the country's geopolitics with Afghanistan, the U.S. government stopped using the term in 2010. When it is still used, AfPak is considered proper as it doesn't contain the hyphen. In 2017, the Trump administration expanded its Afghan policy to a regional South Asia strategy, which sought continued counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan and envisaged a greater economic role for India in Afghanistan. The new approach has been dubbed \\"AfPakIndia\\". Origin Michael Quinion writes that the term began appearing in newspaper articles in February 2009. The term was popularized, and possibly coined, by Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration's Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. In March 2008 (a year before he assumed that post) Holbrooke explained the motivation behind the term: > First of all, we often call the problem AfPak, as in Afghanistan Pakistan. > This is not just an effort to save eight syllables. It is an attempt to > indicate and imprint in our DNA the fact that there is one theater of war, > straddling an ill-defined border, the Durand Line, and that on the western > side of that border, NATO and other forces are able to operate. On the > eastern side, it's the sovereign territory of Pakistan. But it is on the > eastern side of this ill-defined border that the international terrorist > movement is located. According to the US government, the common policy objective was to disrupt, dismantle, and prevent Al Qaeda and its affiliates from having a safe haven from which it can continue to operate and plot attacks against the U.S and its allies. This policy decision represented a shift from previous ways of thinking about Afghanistan as an independent problem that required a military solution. The AfPak strategy was an attempt to win the ‚Äúhearts and minds‚Äù of the Afghan and Pakistani people. In 2009, US national security advisor Jim Jones proposed reversing the term to \\"PakAf,\\" but Pakistanis resisted the suggestion that their nation was the primary source of difficulty, according to Bob Woodward in his book Obama's Wars. Impact The term AfPak has entered the lexicon of geopolitics, and has made clear to the world that the primary fronts for the global war on terrorism lied in Afghanistan and Pakistan at the time. It has reinforced the message that the threat to US from pro-terrorist activities masquerading as Islamic religious policy, and the resulting fear infrastructure and problems in the two countries are intertwined. In recent years, Syria has eclipsed at least Pakistan as containing the largest most dangerous groups of international terrorists operating within it. However Afghanistan and Pakistan still have significant problems with terrorists determined to operate on their soil. Official use of the term within the Obama administration has been echoed by the media, as in The Washington Post series The AfPak War and The Af-Pak Channel, a joint project of the New America Foundation and Foreign Policy magazine launched in August 2009.  Related Events  In order to better enforce border security and to vitiate the cross border phenomenon that inspired the AfPak label, Pakistan has started constructing a border barrier. Pakistan hopes it will impede the illegal cross border traffic that various terror organizations depend on to maintain safe havens where they can plan attacks and hideout. Criticism The term has been widely criticized in Pakistan. Amir Taheri writes that Holbrooke's use of the term has been resented by many Pakistanis, who see Pakistan as \\"in a different league than the much smaller and devastated Afghanistan.\\" Clifford May writes that it is disliked by Afghans as well. Pakistani journalist Saeed Shah who is a contributor to The Guardian newspaper mentioned that the international community have always had Pakistan and India bracketed together, and Pakistan always had, and still in some ways, compares itself with India. This is due to the fact that Pakistan was a part of India before 1947. Pakistanis have never compared themselves with Afghans. He mentions that the United States has lumped Pakistan with Afghanistan under \\"Af-Pak\\", a diplomatic relegation, while India is lauded as a growing power. This is a key reason why Pakistan is seeking a nuclear deal with the US as \\"parity\\" with India. In June 2009 former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf criticized the term in an interview with Der Spiegel: > I am totally against the term AfPak. I do not support the word itself for > two reasons: First, the strategy puts Pakistan on the same level as > Afghanistan. We are not. Afghanistan has no government and the country is > completely destabilized. Pakistan is not. Second, and this is much more > important, is that there is an Indian element in the whole game. We have the > Kashmir struggle, without which extremist elements like Lashkar-e-Taiba > would not exist. As seen by Pakistan, India \\"should have been\\" part of a wide regional strategy including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir. However, the Indian government disposed of this proposition with ease. Answering questions at a June 2009 press conference in Islamabad, Holbrooke \\"said the term 'Afpak' was not meant to demean Pakistan, but was 'bureaucratic shorthand' intended to convey that the situation in the border areas on both sides was linked and one side could not be resolved without the other.\\" In January 2010 Holbrooke said that the administration had stopped using the term: \\"We can't use it anymore because it does not please people in Pakistan, for understandable reasons.\\" There is also criticism that while the complaint about the usage of the word included the term \\"hyphenation\\", solely addressing the issue by not using a hyphen misses the point. Even if the hyphen is not used some continue to look for reasons to not like the term.

As of March 2009, Del Rey Manga has published 3 bound volumes of the manga. Synopsis The story opens with Lewin Randit and his archenemy, first-year Darwell Turkfan clashing in the swordsmanship practice field. In combat, Darwell taunts Lewin calling him \\"loser-kun\\" not long after releasing a powerful sword wave, enraging Lewin. As his temper flares, he swings his sword over his head, breaking a rule of conduct, and knocks Darwell to the ground. Stabbing the earth beside Darwell's head he threatens Darwell, causing him to submit. Seconds after the fight, Professor Qualfer suddenly appears and grabs Lewin by the neck, scolds him for swinging his weapon above his head, and sends him to the infirmary to have his wounds patched. As the healer, Professor Milieu Rouge, cleans his scars, Lewin asks why she doesn't use magic to heal his wounds. He believes it is because he is the only student unable to use magic so that the healer would treat him differently. Milieu explains that although she has the power to heal with magic, she restrains herself because by doing so, she would upset the natural balance. As Lewin exits the infirmary he comes across a wall that separates the wizardry division with the swordsmanship classes. There, he is overwhelmed by painful memories of his peers, specifically Darwell, taunting him about his red hair and inability to use magic. Has the thoughts unravel, he ends up injuring himself by clouting the wall out of agony. As he cries, Lewin remarks that despite his perception of only feeling frustration at first, he still harbors that emotional pain. The following day, Lewin pays a visit to the school library in order the research methods to fix his rusty sword with. As he descends on a moving stairway, a book unexpectedly plummets from the sky, followed by a girl whom Lewin catches. Her weight sends him tumbling down the stairway as an elf rushes to the girl's aid. Noticing that she has injured Lewin, the girl attempts to patch his wounds with little success, apologizing for her inability to use healing magic. Upon hearing that, Lewin tells the girl the same thing that Milieu had told him the day before: Don't use magic for everything. The elf gathers Lewin's books before both the girl and elf recognize him as the \\"Red Haired Boy\\". They introduce themselves as Chris Cottonburg and Soela Evenport before proposing the fact that he is \\"famous\\". They go on to tell Lewin the rumors that they have heard of him. Lewin finally realizes how people think of him, believing that Soela and Chris were going to brag about their learning and ridicule him. Instead Chris complements Lewin for being a kind person for helping Soela. Soela thanks Lewin for his help and smiles at him, which takes him by surprise. Suddenly, a large object falls from above, which lands on Lewin's head. Soela remarks on how the beast creature usually stays away from people and suggests that maybe he wants to thank Lewin for his deed. Chris and Soela then tell Lewin of their assignment from the magic classes. They are to open a book sealed by a magic force. The only way to open it is to locate where all the hidden passageways are in the school. Easily, Lewin is able to tell the two where the passages are since he has spent much of time at the school observing. The books opens, much to Chris and Soela's delight. After the incident, Lewin becomes their friend, making him much more happy as noted by one of the school's enchanted cleaning maids. Everyday, Lewin would meet Soela and Chris at the library. Eventually, Chris and Soela decide to smuggle Lewin into the Magic division of the school to thank him. Eventually, Chis and Soela decide to show Lewin one of the classrooms. The find one that is unlocked, and hurry in. Lewin immediately begins to look around, touching many of the items in the room, including a bottle of undead seeds. He uncorks the bottle to look inside, but Soela hastily runs in to warn them of a teacher coming their way. As the trio rush out, Lewin places the bottle of undead seeds on the counter. It falls to the ground and shatters, exposing the seeds to oxygen. Due to the fact that oxygen causes the activation of the seeds, skeletons spring out. The skeletons eventually break out of the classroom and invade the campus, causing much panic. The invasion reaches the degree where it is necessary for teacher intervention.

Volume list Reception Aventura has been compared to Harry Potter through the shared theme of magic schooling, as well as Naruto with regard to the central protagonist. The manga has been criticized for the similarity in its character designs and the derivative nature of its story.

She was called the \\"queen of expressive feelings\\" () and the \\"Goldfish Beauty\\" ().  Career  Tsui Ping's family originates from Jiangsu, China, but she was born in Harbin in 1938, where the family resided while her father was on business. Her family later came to reside in Hong Kong where she received her education and lived during her singing career. She was quite fascinated by Mandarin pop music by Shanghai singers like Chang Loo, Bai Guang, and others, that she heard on the radio. At age 15, she was invited to sing at a party in a nightclub. The nightclub owner was so impressed that he asked her to sign a contract, thus beginning her singing career. Tsui Ping had also auditioned to star in Shaw Brothers' films and acted in one movie, but later she decided to focus mainly on being a professional singer. Her dream at the time was to record albums. While Tsui Ping was singing in nightclubs, songwriter Wong Fuk Lin () was very impressed by her talent and encouraged her greatly. Two of the songs he later wrote became Tsui Ping's trademarks: \\"This Precious Night\\" () and \\"Nang Ping Evening Bells\\" (). \\"This Precious Night\\" was played to Taiwanese soldiers-in-training every night at bedtime. Tsui's musical talents made her one of the most popular artists in Hong Kong and at times one of the highest paid singers. Some of her recordings of previous hits were more popular than the originals: e.g. \\"Meet Again\\" () and \\"Needing Each Other\\" () Her performances consisted of singing in nightclubs in Hong Kong and South East Asia, making appearances in musical shows on television and recording with EMI Path√©. She formed a trio with Tsin Ting () and Billie Tam () for the opening of a new Hong Kong music club. The trio recorded several songs, including \\"Fragrance of the Night\\" (), \\"Shangri-La\\" (), and \\"Not Going Home Tonight\\" (). In 1971, she publicly announced her retirement from singing to dedicate time to her family. A public farewell party was televised. A special Tsui Ping magazine was also published. Three separate music awards were given to her within 1970-1971. Tsui Ping gave singing lessons for a few years and later had to give it up due to family matters. In 1997 she performed four successful \\"Golden Concerts\\" with her contemporaries Tsin Ting (), Wu Yingyin (), and Liu Yun (). In 2004, she was invited by the late James Wong () to participate in his television nightclub series, singing Mandarin pop hits again. Personal life In 1964 Tsui married famous dubbing singer Kiang Hung/Jiang Hong (), who was also well known for the dubbing of male voices in Shaw Brothers' movies and often sang duets with Tsin Ting ÈùôÂ©∑. They have 3 children: 2 daughters and 1 son (as reported in 1970). Kiang died in 1995. In her free time she sings Beijing opera.

From 2009 to 2010, he was the Prime Minister of Somalia. He subsequently briefly served as Somalia's Ambassador to the United States in 2014. In December 2014, Sharmarke was reappointed Prime Minister of Somalia. His term ended on 1 March 2017 and was replaced by Hassan Ali Khaire. Personal life Sharmarke was born in 1960 in Mogadishu, situated in the southeastern Banaadir province of Somalia. He is the son of the former second President and first Prime Minister of Somalia, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, who was assassinated in 1969, and Rukiyo Mo‚Äôalim Daahir, the daughter of the well- known Somali Islamic scholar Mo‚Äôalim Dahir Ali Boss. His family belongs to the Majeerteen Harti Darod clan, and originally hails from Somalia's northeastern Puntland region. Sharmarke studied at Carleton University in Ottawa, where he earned degrees in political science and political economy. Although his family is based in Virginia in the United States, he holds both Somali and Canadian citizenship. Career Early career Sharmarke has worked in a diplomatic capacity for the United Nations in Sri Lanka and Sierra Leone, and served as a political advisor on the Darfur conflict in Sudan. Before becoming Prime Minister, he was Somalia's ambassador-designate to the United States. Prime Minister of Somalia, 1st term =Appointment= On the February 13, 2009, then President of Somalia Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed nominated Sharmarke to become Prime Minister at a meeting in Djibouti. Sharmarke's nomination was widely welcomed, with a spokesman for the moderate Islamic Courts movement describing him as an \\"honest\\" man who should bring about \\"positive changes.\\" Political analysts were optimistic about the selection. It was seen as a successful attempt to shore up support for the Transitional Federal Government both among the diaspora and within the country. Sharmarke was considered someone who could potentially bridge the gap between the various groups currently competing for influence in Somalia, as he was based abroad and thus not tied to local politics. Sharmarke's appointment was also seen by some analysts as an attempt to secure the favor of the large Darod clan, whose Majeerteen branch both Sharmarke and the outgoing President of Somalia, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, were members of. On February 14, lawmakers approved Sharmarke as Prime Minister with a vote of 414 in favour, 9 opposed and 2 not voting. In his acceptance speech, Sharmarke pledged to encourage reconciliation and to create unity in Somalia. However, the Al-Shabaab Islamist insurgents who are currently waging war against the federal government, condemned his appointment, with a spokesman for the group saying that \\"an unlawful camel never gives birth to lawful ones.\\"Sharmarke named Somalia‚Äôs new PM ‚Äì ArabNews On February 21, Radio Garowe reported that Prime Minister Sharmarke had selected a new Council of Ministers, reserving key posts for former opposition lawmakers. Before a meeting in Djibouti attended by President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed and a host of other Somali politicians and international observers, Sharmarke appointed Sheikh Abdulkadir Ali Omar, the Islamic Courts senior ground commander, as the Minister of Interior, and former parliament Speaker, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Adan, as the new Minister of Finance. Sharmarke also appointed the scholar, Mohamed Abdi Gandhi, as Minister of Defense, and three women as Ministers of Health, Family Affairs, and Rural Development. The new Cabinet easily gained a parliamentary vote-of- confidence.Somalia's new government dominated by former opposition members ‚Äì Garowe Online Sharmarke and the rest of the federal government then relocated from Djibouti to Mogadishu. =Stand-off= In April and May 2010, a rift developed between Prime Minister Sharmarke and then Speaker of Parliament, Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe, which culminated in the Speaker's resignation after parliament later voted to remove him from office. Despite Madobe agreeing to relieve himself of his duties as Speaker, the incumbent President Sharif announced shortly afterwards his dismissal of Prime Minister Sharmarke and his intention of forming a new government. This move was quickly welcomed by the UN Special Representative for Somalia, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, a close associate and supporter of Sharif. Ould-Abdallah himself came under fire for his reportedly disruptive role in the continuing conflict in southern Somalia, including meddling in local politics and attempting to advance foreign agendas.Critics say UN envoy to Somalia should resign In response, Prime Minister Sharmarke told the press that Sharif did not have the authority to dismiss him, and stated that he would remain in office until parliament passes a vote of no confidence.Somalia stand-off as PM defies president's sacking orderSomalia: Deposed Somali PM says government still exist Sharmarke added that he \\"met the president and informed him that I wouldn't submit a resignation because his decision is not supported by the transitional charter\\",Somali prime minister refuses to leave office and that ‚Äúthe government is formed in accordance with the constitution and the national charter...

Supporters of Prime Minister Sharmarke were also reported to have gathered in the north-central Mudug region of Somalia to protest in his defense.Gulf of Aden Security Review ‚Äì May 19, 2010 On May 20, President Sharif reversed his decision to sack Prime Minister Sharmarke after consulting with lawyers, who advised Sharif that the dismissal was indeed unconstitutional. Analysts also stated that the move has severely undermined Sharif's credibility, as well as that of the U.N. representative, Ould-Abdallah, who had backed him.President reinstates prime minister of Somalia On May 26, following another disagreement with Prime Minister Sharmarke, incumbent President Sharif again announced his unilateral plan to appoint a new Premier. Associates of Sharif's also reportedly attempted to persuade Sharmarke to resign, but the Premier again refused to step down and vowed instead to remain in office until his tenure constitutionally expires.Somalia president 'to name new Premier' as controversy deepens Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, the incumbent President of Somalia's autonomous Puntland region in the northeast, attempted to help settle the dispute, warning that if not resolved amicably, the rift could result in the ultimate collapse of the Transitional Federal Government.Somalia leaders' feud deepens as PM refuse to step down In September 2010, disagreements again arose between Prime Minister Sharmarke and President Sharif, this time over the nation's draft constitution, an initiative supported by the United Nations, the European Union and the United States. Sharmarke reportedly wanted the document put before parliament and civil society members, while the president wanted it to be put to a referendum.15 die in Somalia as parliament demands gov't vote On September 14, it was reported that the Premier had convened with MPs and ministers at the presidential residence to discuss the issue, where Sharmarke indicated that he would welcome a resolution to the dispute but would not step down.

Puntland President Abdirahman Mohamud Farole in an interview likewise urged the federal government's leaders to set aside their differences for the sake of the country. Farole added that the \\"government [TFG] has a short time in office remaining and it should not be changed. This is also the position of countries who are interested in Somali affairs\\". Critics have also accused President Sharif of attempting to force Prime Minister Sharmarke out of office to remain in power beyond his term's expiry in August 2011. =Resignation= In May 2010, the Parliamentary Speaker Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe resigned after parliament voted to remove him from office due to a rift between him and Prime Minister Sharmarke.

Prime Minister of Somalia, 2nd term =Appointment= On 17 December 2014, Sharmarke was reappointed Prime Minister of Somalia by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. He replaced Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed, who was voted out of office by the Federal Parliament. Mohamud indicated that he nominated Sharmarke both on his own volition and at the recommendation of local and international partners. He also commended Sharmarke for strengthening diplomatic ties between the Somalian and U.S. governments during his brief tenure as Somalia's Ambassador to the United States. In his acceptance speech, Sharmarke pledged to form a broad-based Cabinet and work towards meeting the goals enshrined in Vision 2016. The regional Puntland and Jubaland administrations, as well as the AU Special Representative for Somalia and the Ambassador of Germany to Somalia all issued press statements welcoming his appointment. On 24 December, the national legislature approved Sharmarke's nomination. According to Federal Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari, of the 224 MPs present at the parliamentary session, 218 voted in favor of the appointment, none rejected it or abstained, and six left the hall. The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, European Union, and US government all welcomed the endorsement and reaffirmed their support for the Somalian authorities. On 25 December, Sharmarke officially took office at a handover ceremony in Villa Somalia attended by President Mohamud, outgoing cabinet ministers, and legislators, among other guests. Former Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed therein urged the new administration and legislature to work together to implement the tasks within Vision 2016. Sharmarke and Mohamud in turn lauded Ahmed's administration, and noted its various achievements in terms of domestic and foreign policy. =Cabinet= On 12 January 2015, Sharmarke announced his new Federal Cabinet, consisting of 26 ministers, 25 deputy ministers, and 8 state ministers. Many ministers were retained from the previous Ahmed administration. Sharmarke indicated that he selected the new Council of Ministers after intensive consultations with local stakeholders, with the aim of balancing the public interest with governmental continuation and administrative priorities.

The UN, AU, EU, IGAD and US and UK governments all applauded the announcement, and reemphasized the importance of working toward the Vision 2016 benchmarks. =Somalia-UAE bilateral cooperation= In January 2015, Prime Minister Sharmarke met with the United Arab Emirates Ambassador to Somalia Mohammed Ahmed Othman Al Hammadi at his Mogadishu office. The officials touched on various matters of bilateral interest, including military operations, governmental re-institutionalization, maritime security, and the local reconstruction process. Sharmarke noted the longstanding and close relationship between the territories of Somalia and the UAE. Ambassador Al Hammadi in turn pledged that the Emirati authorities would support the ongoing developmental activities in Somalia. The meeting was among several that Sharmarke held during the week, including gatherings with the Ambassadors of China, the United States, United Kingdom and Sweden, and with Special Envoys from the UN and AU. In April 2015, Sharmarke met again in Mogadishu with the UAE Ambassador to Somalia Al Hammadi.

He also met with civil society leaders and AMISOM representatives. Kerry was likewise expected to commit further assistance toward the local reconstruction and development process. =Taxation policy= In May 2015, Sharmarke announced that his administration was developing a new nationwide taxation policy. According to the Prime Minister, the initiative aims to increase government income and further buttress the commercial sector. It is part of a broader socioeconomic stimulus plan, which will be centered on comprehensive feasibility and goal- oriented analysis. The new taxation bill is scheduled to be put before parliament for deliberation. Additionally, Sharmarke indicated that his administration would seek to attract direct foreign investments. =Somalia- Qatar bilateral cooperation= In May 2015, Prime Minister Sharmarke, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Foreign Affairs Minister Abdisalam Omer met in Villa Somalia in Mogadishu with a visiting Qatari government delegation led by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Qatar, Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiyah.

The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from bleached or unbleached chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The back side of the board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications.

On 1 July 2013, all its activities were taken over by Fundsquare, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The majority of the information on investment funds that was collected and disseminated by Finesti was derived from Luxembourg- domiciled funds, although it was also active in collecting data and documents from funds in other European countries. As at December 2008, its database contained data and documents on around 31,000 share classes of investment funds. Data and documents were collected from fund administrators and promoters. They were then repackaged into dissemination products for data vendors and other users of bulk data. Information collected was also made available on its website.  Company History and Organisation  The company was created in April 1995, as CCLux (Centrale de Communications Luxembourg S.A.), by the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry (ALFI), the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and around thirty Luxembourg financial institutions. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in May 2002. On 28 January 2009, it changed its name to Finesti. It shared infrastructure and resources with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and, in particular, it shared a secure transmission platform, known as e-file.lu. Following its integration into Fundsquare in July 2013, the company was wound up.  Collection Platforms  The e-file.lu platform was used for transmission of fund regulatory reports and other fund documents, such as prospectuses and annual and semi-annual reports, to the Luxembourg financial regulator, the CSSF, and the Central Bank of Luxembourg. Finesti was mandated by these authorities to provide these services. In addition to this platform, it also ran an in-house collection platform, known as the Finesti Station, for the collection of other types of data from investment fund administrators.  Partnerships  Finesti and a Danish company called FundConnect were mandated by the European Fund and Asset Management Association (EFAMA) to be joint Classification Administrators of its European Fund Classification (EFC) with the mission to implement the EFC on a pan-European basis. The company was also active in the provision of Fund Processing Passports, short harmonized documents containing all key operational information to facilitate investment fund processing within Europe. Finesti also provided data services for the Luxembourg Fund Labelling Agency (LuxFLAG), an organisation providing information on microfinance investment vehicles.

(Philippines), otherwise known as the Basilan Jaycees, extended on January 11, 1949 by JCI Manila and JCI Zamboanga, registered under the Laws of the Republic of the Philippines with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the Junior Chamber of Basilan City, Inc. on August 26, 1965, is an affiliate of Junior Chamber International Philippines, Inc. (JCIP) and Junior Chamber International (JCI), A Worldwide Federation of Young Leaders and Entrepreneurs.  Headquarters  The Basilan Jaycee Clubhouse is currently located at Isabela City, Basilan 7300  History   Basilan Junior Chamber of Commerce  Charter Induction of the Basilan Junior Chamber of Commerce, December 11, 1949 at the old Basilan City Hall Courtyard; Middle and Bottom photos: Basilan Jaycees delegation at the 1950 Manila World Congress) The Basilan Junior Chamber of Commerce was organized on January 11, 1949 in a Joint Chapter Extension Project of the Manila and Zamboanga Jaycees. It included some of Basilan‚Äôs most active and civic-minded personalities in law, public service, medicine and business at the outset. Its Charter President (1949‚Äì1950), Dr. Isidro Sta. Elena, eventually became JCP Regional Vice President for Northern Mindanao in 1951-1952. National President Joaquin V. Gonzalez flew in from Manila to witness the induction of the Chapter‚Äôs 3rd President (1951), Judge Doroteo de Guzman. 4th President (1952), Dr. Alejandro C. Infante, founder of the Infante Hospital in Isabela City, was the longest-serving Adviser of the Chapter, whose service to the organization spanned over 50 years, until his demise in 2007. He was followed by a succession of able young Presidents who steered the Chapter in its early years. Prominent businessmen Amado Borja (1953), Thomas Ba Leong (1953), Carlos F. Tan (1955), and Judge Francisco S. Atilano (1955) were among the pioneers of this intrepid group of young leaders who invested the Chapter with a strong foundation based on an enduring vision of leadership and service to the community. The 8th President (1957), Retired Supreme Court Associate Justice Regino C. Hermosisima, Jr., and current 3-term Regular Member of the Judicial and Bar Council, now in his early 90s, also became a JCP Regional Vice President for Northern Mindanao (1954‚Äì1955). He presided over the controversial Aquino-Galman Double Murder Case in 1983. He has since retired from the Supreme Court, but has remained active in civic affairs as the Honorary National Chairman of the Young Men‚Äôs Christian Association (YMCA) of the Philippines. He was followed by the Chapter‚Äôs first elected two-termer, Emilio Lim (1958 & 1959) and then by Atty. Laurencio Saavedra (1960 & 1961) who also served two terms, Ricardo Madayag (1962), and then by Judge Cesar S. Principe (1963).  Junior Chamber of Basilan City, Inc.  The Chapter was officially registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 26, 1965, as the Junior Chamber of Basilan City, Inc., during the term of its 13th President (1964 & 1965), also a two-termer, and who likewise became the first JCI Senator of the Chapter, JCI Sen. Simplicio A. Bonifacio. He then went on to become a JCP Regional Vice President for Southern Mindanao (1968). A local politician, he served in the Basilan Provincial Board for three terms before retiring in the early 1990s. He was followed by fellow lawyers Selso Manzanaris (1966) and Ricardo G. Mon (1967), who was on his third term as a City Councilor by the time he took over administration of the Chapter. The organization became a force in local politics towards the late 1960s, when young politicians started to quickly fill up its ranks. Often split into two main opposing Liberal (LP) and Nacionalista (NP) wings, the organization mirrored the realities of local politics, serving as the most prestigious training ground for young politicians in the local arena. Chapter elections were hotly contested and these rivalries and factions were soon reflected in the floors of the Basilan City Council throughout the rest of the decade, well into the early years of the 1970s. As the organization continued to attract the sons of local political families of Basilan, this same period saw oppositionist young Turks take control of the Chapter. Being young themselves, Presidents Reynaldo Martinez (1968), Armando L. Salvador (1969), and Quirico Tan (1970) worked closely with opposition stalwart and 6-term Basilan City Mayor Leroy S. Brown in denouncing the increasingly difficult situation that unfolded in Manila and Mindanao. By then, Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos' once popular administration seemed to unravel by the day, kicking off with the bloody Jabidah Massacre, followed by the Moro Uprising of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), and then finally by the increasingly violent student-led First Quarter Storm militant street actions in 1969. Responding to the need for the Chapter to touch-base with Basilan‚Äôs core Muslim constituencies, even as the Nur Misuari-led secessionist movement continued to wreak havoc in the countryside, the members elected its first Muslim President (1971) in the person of a young Ulbert Ulama Tugung, a learned scholar and respected public servant who became a JCP Regional Vice President for Southern Mindanao (1977). He was ultimately appointed by Pres. Corazon C. Aquino to be the first Regional Governor of the Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook (LTP) or the Regional Administration for Western Mindanao and Sulu. Sadly, his exemplary leadership was cut short by an assassin‚Äôs bullet. His wife, Jayceerette PP Elnorita Pamaran Tugung, was appointed LTP Regional Governor at his death, and went on to win as Congresswoman of Basilan in 1992-1995. He was followed by NP party member JCI Sen. Aniceto G. Mon (1972) the twin brother of the Chapter's 15th President, Ricardo Mon. Then on December 21, 1972, Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law and promptly placed Basilan City under a Military Government, presided over by Col. Tomas G. Nanquil, Jr., then the Brigade Commander of 24th Infantry Brigade stationed in Basilan, and then by Rear Admiral Romulo Espaldon, Commanding Officer of the Philippine Armed Forces' Southern Command. Basilan City was summarily abolished and replaced by the Province of Basilan as embodied in Presidential Decree No. 356 signed on December 27, 1973. Ten Municipalities were initially carved out of Basilan City through P.D. 593 promulgated on December 2, 1974. Atty. Ricardo G. Mon, who was Chapter President in 1967, was appointed as the first Mayor of Isabela Municipality. At around this time, the Basilan Jayceerettes made its glamorous presence known. A series of socio-civic projects were conducted by the wives of the Jaycees as they promoted advocacies which ranged from a variety of environmental concerns to education and community health. The 24th President (1973), JCI Sen. Louis W. Alano started the first of what eventually came to be three terms at the helm of the Chapter.  Silver Jubilee  Basilan Jaycees Bowling Tournament, 1975 The Chapter celebrated its Silver Jubilee under the administration of its 25th President (1974) Dr. Edgardo Eustaquio, a public servant and health practitioner, one of the founders of the Basilan Community Hospital and a three-term City Councilor of Isabela City. He was followed by 26th President (1975), local business taipan JCI Sen. Yu Chi Han, whose lasting legacy of forging deeper ties between the Chapter and the local business community strengthened the Jaycees more so because the political situation deteriorated further as Basilan‚Äôs highlands was transformed into a combat zone where the military staged running gun-battles with the MNLF and isolated bandit groups, the ‚Äúblack shirts‚Äù or ‚Äúmunduhin‚Äù as they came to be romantically called. Also, as the countryside was rent asunder by a total breakdown in the peace and order, right-wing vigilante groups such as the Ilonggo-based ‚Äúilaga‚Äù and the Chavacano-Bisaya ‚Äúmundo oscurro‚Äù rose up from nowhere and started to give the Muslim communities tit-for-tat.  Basilan Jaycees, Inc.  In the midst of the seeming chaos, the Chapter evolved once again, officially changing its name to the Basilan Jaycees, Inc., during the incumbency of the 27th (1976) and 28th (1977) President, JCI Sen. Fernando S. Cariaga, the first in a line of educators and faithful church workers, whose steady management of the Chapter‚Äôs affairs gave it a much-needed breather from all the politics which threatened to pull the chapter apart. A surprising economic upturn, engendered by the Marcos administration‚Äôs many infrastructure projects and programs, gave the Chapter and the Basile√±os a healthy respite from the incessant conflict that bugged the island. What followed were some of the most active years of the Jaycees, led by JCI Sen. Kieck Seng Tan (1978) under whose able leadership the very first batch of Lady Jaycees were inducted, JCI Sen. Roque C. Tan (1979), and then again by JCI Sen. Louis W. Alano (1980), Engr. Tahir I. Latip (1981), currently Basilan's Provincial Engineer and the second Muslim to be elected President, Napoleon P. Yu (1982), and then for a third time, again by JCI Sen. Louis W. Alano (1983) wherein the Jaycees initiated the creation of political action committees and associations such as the Concerned Citizens‚Äô Aggrupation (CCA) which gathered the local community in indignation rallies against the Marcos dictatorship immediately after the assassination of Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., as well as organized an Operation Quick Count for the 1986 Snap Elections, in close coordination with the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL). For this, he was eventually appointed by President Corazon C. Aquino as the OIC Governor of Basilan Province upon her accession in 1986. Currently, he is the Deputy Governor for Christian Affairs of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The 35th (1984) and 36th President (1985), also a two-termer, was Atty. Alvin G. Dans, a scion of yet another of the most established families in Basilan. He was eventually elected Mayor of the Municipality of Isabela for two terms, Governor of the Province of Basilan, and Congressman of the Lone District of the Basilan, appointed by Pres. Fidel V. Ramos as Undersecretary of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), he eventually became the Postmaster General of the Philippine Post Office. His wife, Jayceerette Past President Athena Dans is a Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs. He was followed by the 37th President (1986), Perfecto C. Antonio, Jr., a three-termer in the Provincial Board of Basilan Province. The 38th President (1987), Nonito T. Ramirez, was the Secretary of the Isabela City Council for some time.  Junior Chamber of Basilan, Inc.  Basilan Jaycees Bingo Bonanza 1997 The name of the Chapter was reverted to Junior Chamber of Basilan, Inc., under the auspices of the 39th (1988) and 40th President (1989) JCI Sen. Benedicto N. Pe√±aflor, following the JCI amendments during the World Congress in Taipei, Republic of China. He was followed by the 41st (1990) and 42nd President (1991), Michael M. Manapol, the Isabela City Tourism Officer from 1998 to 2007. A succession of able Presidents and leaders handled the Chapter in the 1990s, even as the ugly head of the Abu Sayyaf stole international headlines and totally re-wrote Basilan‚Äôs image here and abroad. The Chapter owes its existence in these most troubled times to the grit and temerity of Edgardo P. Ferrer (1992), well-connected businessman and entrepreneur, Rogelio J. Francisco (1993) an accomplished investment banker under whose term the Basilan Taguima Junior Jaycees was organized, Judge Danilo M. Bucoy (1994), the brave Regional Trial Court Judge who sentenced captured Abu Sayyaf terrorists to death, and the back-to-back two-termers Carlos F. Luy (1995 & 1996) and Edgar R. Suson (1997 & 1998).  Golden Anniversary  It is particularly remarkable to note, however, that it took the Chapter all of half a century since its inception, and 20 years since its first female member was inducted, to finally elect its very first Lady President. The chapter‚Äôs 50th President (1999) JCI Sen. Laura W. Alano, was likewise elected National Vice President for Western Mindanao (2000). She was awarded ‚ÄòMost Outstanding National Vice President for Area V in 2000‚Äô and is the first Lady JCI Senator of the chapter. She was followed by JCI Mem. Ma. Theresa M. Alano (2000), who was appointed by Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as Assistant Secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) charged with Christian-Muslim Affairs and Mindanao in general, and then by JCI Mem. Tita Orbecido-Tan (2001), also a teacher, who spearheaded the creation of Junior Jaycee Chapters in Basilan. The 53rd President (2002), JCI Mem. Reymond E. Bicariato, was the Administrator of the Philippine National Red Cross ‚Äì Basilan Chapter during his incumbency and organized relief efforts and extended aid, also with the assistance of the Jaycees, to the hostages of the Abu Sayyaf kidnapping spree of 2001-2002, forging lasting ties with the troops in the US-RP Balikatan 02-1 Joint Military Exercises. Our 54th President (2003), JCI Mem. Svetlana E. C. Sanchez, daughter of JCI Sen. Fernando Cariaga, signaled the generational shift in the chapter‚Äôs long history as the Baby Boomers eventually handed over control of the Chapter to succeeding generations of JCI Members.

Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, President of the Republic of the Philippines as Inducting Officer Yet another page in the Chapter‚Äôs history was finally turned as, following the JCI Corporate Identity Program approved at the 2003 World Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark, the Chapter‚Äôs name was officially changed to Junior Chamber International ‚Äì Basilan Inc., during the incumbency of the 55th President (2004), JCI Mem. Jaime J. A. Rivera. He was elected National Vice President for Western Mindanao for 2006. He is the Chapter‚Äôs first JCIP Academy and PRIME Graduate (Davao 2004), as well as Certified Local Trainer duly accredited by JCI University, his term has been characterized by a closer coordination with local government units, greater synergy with the business sector, and renewed ties with other Jaycee Chapters. He likewise won the \\"Most Outstanding National Vice President Award of Recognition\\" at the 2006 JCI Philippines National Convention held in Subic, Zambales on October 2006, and was appointed National Chairman of the Voice of Philippine Democracy project, as well as National Adviser of the Philippine Junior Jaycees, Inc. in 2007. The 56th President (2005) JCI Mem. Nuayme ‚ÄúIndah‚Äù M. Sangkula, hails from the prodigious Sangkula Clan of Sulu, and is also a teacher, the third Muslim President of the chapter. The flagship \\"Miss Isabela Earth Pageant\\" was held during this term, with the winner - Miss Bernadette Estrada (Tantoco) - carrying the Miss Western Mindanao - Earth title and reaching the semi-finals in the Miss Philippines-Earth 2005 in Manila. JCI Basilan Inc. likewise hosted the 1st Area Council Meeting of JCI Philippines Area 5 (Mindanao) at Lantaka Hotel, Zamboanga City. The Chapter‚Äôs 57th President (2006) JCI Mem. Rowell C. Acaylar, is a Registered Nurse and a former Police Officer. He is currently a Clinical Instructor at the Mindanao Autonomous College Foundation Inc. (MACFI) in Lamitan City. His term is highlighted by twin victories at the National Convention Temyong Awards held in Subic, Zambales, where the Chapter‚Äôs only two bids for ‚ÄúMost Outstanding JCI Week Celebration‚Äù and ‚ÄúMost Outstanding JCI Family‚Äù both won coveted ‚ÄúRecognitions‚Äù, a substantial feat considering the competition for said categories. It was also on this year that JCI Basilan Inc. voluntarily split into two, with the male members retaining the Chapter‚Äôs name and seal, while lady JCI Members were assisted in forming the all-female JCI Basile√±a, officially recognized on April 8, 2006 during the 2nd National Board Meeting of JCI Philippines Inc., held in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental. SIDEBAR: JCI Basile√±a was led by its Charter President, JCI Mem. Carlissele Rodriguez-Navales, followed by JCI Mem. Bernadita F. Hontucan in 2007, and Rev. May Casiano-Casada, a female Priest of the Episcopal Church in 2008 before falling into a hiatus. The all-female chapter has since been revived for 2014 by JCI Mem. Ma. Jennesa Santos-Tubongbanua, Isabela City Councilor. Yet another example of inter-generational dynamics happening in the Chapter is the election of Atty. Orheim T. Ferrer, son of 1992 PP Edgardo Ferrer, as the Chapter‚Äôs 58th President (2007). He is followed by the 59th President JCI Mem. James Abner S. Rodriguez, Isabela City Councilor, school administrator and community organizer, with strong ties to the local military establishment.

Before water mains were installed in the village, water was obtained from wells and cisterns, and from nearby Hornbeam Spring (Pod gabrom). A spring in the lower part of the village has been impounded for use as a water source for livestock. There is a karst spring in a meadow in the woods south of the village.

The name therefore originally means 'Slavo's village', referring to an early inhabitant. History During the Second World War, the Partisans had a bunker in the area, in the woods about south of the village.

Records. It is their last album to feature lead singer Frank Carter, and their first with guitarist Steph Carter writing and recording. Background information A second album by Gallows was first hinted by vocalist Frank Carter during an interview with NME in 2007, where he stated that because Gallows was \\"a hobby I get paid for,\\" the band would likely be defunct by 2010. However, he confirmed that during this period, the band would record up to two additional albums. He later told Kerrang! that the claims regarding the band's imminent break-up were untrue. In an interview with Kerrang!, it was revealed that Gallows' sophomore effort would feature guest appearances by Biffy Clyro's Simon Neil, and various members of Rolo Tomassi and Cancer Bats. In an interview at Sonisphere 2009, the brother of Frank Carter and vocalist of British hardcore band Blackhole, Richard Carter confirmed that he appeared on the track 'Black Eyes'. In the March edition of Total Guitar, guitarists Steph Carter and Laurent Barnard noted that most of the keyboards had been stripped back and that the guitars were reminiscent of Black Sabbath's 1970s efforts. In a January 2009 interview with Rock Sound, Carter announced that Grey Britain would be \\"49 minutes of aggressive music\\" and that signing a contract with a major label had not influenced the band to record a \\"poppy\\" or more \\"commercial\\" album.\\"Gallows: Classic Concepts\\". (January 2009). Rock Sound, p.65 On 13 January 2009 Carter revealed on BBC Radio 1 that the album would be released in early May 2009, after which the band will resume touring. On the following day, the band announced their second studio album would be titled Grey Britain, and that it has been produced by Garth Richardson. Carter explained the premise of the album to Kerrang!, saying, \\"Britain is fucked. Grey Britain is all about what's going on socially, politically and economically in the UK and how it affects us.\\" The tracklisting was revealed on 16 February 2009. Describing the methods of getting samples for the album, bassist Stu Gili-Ross stated \\"The samples on the album are real. There‚Äôs the sound of the River Thames when we went down to the riverbank and recorded the sound of the water. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff on there. We went into a Halal slaughterhouse where a pig was getting slaughtered for food. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a pig getting murdered, that‚Äôs a bit strong. It was going to die anyway so we just turned up with a microphone and captured the sounds.‚Äù However, after PETA criticized the use of a real pig dying for the album, the band revealed they lied and found the sample online. On 1 March 2009 it was announced that the first single from the album would be \\"The Vulture (Acts I & II),\\" to be released on 27 April. The music video for \\"The Vulture (Act II)\\" had its world premiere on 23 March 2009.\\"Gallows Releases New Video\\". Noise Press. Retrieved 2009-03-23 On 17 March 2009, it was revealed that the album's original cover art had to be censored under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and that album's tie-in DVD had been given an 18 certificate. Reception and commercial performance Grey Britain received a 74 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Drowned in Sound commented: \\"the music rockets from intentionally rudimentary knuckle- whiteners to ambitious-of-design affairs that reconfigure one‚Äôs opinions on a band previously seen as a straight-up hardcore act\\". Ben Myers of Mojo commented \\"Not since the Pistols and The Specials has a pissed off provincial band so clearly meant it\\" and ClashMusic called the record \\"as daunting as blow-drying your face in the evil ghost-gas that Indiana Jones unleashes from The Lost Ark\\". The Telegraph praised the group for its lack of compromise, calling Grey Britain \\"a masterpiece of rock brutalism\\". It also noted the progression of Gallows' sound, combining traditional hardcore sound with newer styles, comparing the \\"grotesquely churning riffage\\" with that used by nu metal bands such as Slipknot. It summed up the album as \\"the most exciting album in many moons.\\" Kerrang! listed Grey Britain as the best album of 2009. NME listed the album among the 15 greatest hardcore punk albums of all time. The album debuted at number 20 in the UK album chart on 10 May 2009. In 2014, it was listed as one of Metal Hammer's \\"Modern Classics\\". Musical style and lyrical themes The album has been categorised as hardcore punk and metalcore, showing significantly more metal influence than the band's prior material. Many tracks make heavy use of samples of the River Thames, orchestras and church bells. Songs often makes use fast tempos, gang vocals, heavy guitar riffs and hooks. Lyrical themes Grey Britain is a concept album based around post‚Äìcredit crunch Britain, predicting an increase in \\"racism, xenophobia, knife crime and inescapable mental illness\\".

His interpretations tend to be objective and comprehensive.  Biography   Education  Niziol started learning the violin at the age of five. \\"I have loved music since I was a child. I did what my big sister did: I played the violin, and it suited my inclinations and my talent. Out of this has grown a great love, together with a need to place my gifts at the service of music and of the public. This is something I have never questioned. Consequently, for me, making music has become as natural a process as walking. Without music there is nothing for me\\", says Niziol.After: http://www.stradivariquartett.com/sites_en/bartek_en.html . His first teacher was Stanis≈Çaw ≈ölusarek (at Pa≈Ñstwowa Szko≈Ça Muzyczna I stopnia im. Tadeusza Szeligowskiego in Szczecin, 1979‚Äì1984). We can read on the website of his first school: \\"Very active musically from the beginning of his study, we found him diligent and patient as a pupil of a difficult study of playing the violin\\".After: http://psm.szczecin.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=42&Itemid;=57 . Following this Niziol received tuition in Stanis≈Çaw Hajzer's class (at Zesp√≥≈Ç Szk√≥≈Ç Muzycznych im. Feliksa Nowowiejskiego in Szczecin, 1984‚Äì1987). Niziol entered the music school for gifted children in Pozna≈Ñ at the age of twelve to receive tuition in the class of Prof. Jadwiga Kaliszewska who told him that \\"a gift of music like Bartek's happens once a hundred years or even more rarely\\".This citation comes from the film Bart≈Çomiej Nizio≈Ç - The Winner, directed for Polish Television in 1992. Seven years later (in 1993), Niziol graduated with honour from the Academy of Music in Pozna≈Ñ to continue his study in Lausanne under Pierre Amoyal. Besides his regular studies, he took part in several master classes where he worked with such musicians as Zakhar Bron, Mauricio Fuchs, Ruggiero Ricci and Michael Frischenschlager.  Competitions  Bart≈Çomiej Niziol has won top prizes at many violin competitions: # Second Prize at the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists in Folkestone (group: Juniors, 1987), # First Prize at the International Competition for Young Violinists in Honour of Karol Lipi≈Ñski and Henryk Wieniawski in Lublin (group: Juniors, 1988), # Third Prize at the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists in Folkestone (group: Seniors, 1989), # First Prize & Honourable Mention \\"summa cum laude\\" at the Polishwide Zdzis≈Çaw Jahnke Competition for Violinists in Pozna≈Ñ (1989), # Second Prize at the Polishwide Tadeusz Wro≈Ñski Solo Violin Competition in Warsaw (1990), # Fourth Prize at the Carl Flesch International Violin Competition in London (1990), # First Prize at the Adelaide International Competition (1991), # Third Prize at the Hanover International Violin Competition (1991), # First Prize at the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Pozna≈Ñ (1991 - ex equo with Piotr P≈Çawner), # First Prize at the Pretoria International Competition (1991), # First Prize at the Eurovision Young Musicians in Brussels (1992), # First Prize at the Jacques Thibaud Competition in Paris (1993). After winning at the J. Thibaud Competition, Niziol signed a special contract with the Alliance fran√ßaise to give over 100 concerts all over the world, including 11 countries in Asia and many countries in South America. He has performed in such cities as Tokyo, Mexico City, Caracas, S√£o Paulo, Bogot√°, Rio de Janeiro), and even in small towns in Africa. Niziol, when being interviewed in 1995 for Studio (Polish magazine on classical music), was asked why he had taken part in so many competitions. He answered that \\"Probably only the latest Parisian competition actually gave me full satisfaction. That's why my activities so far have included such a great number of competitions\\".This quote comes from: Studio, nr 2 (20), 1995, page 26. In reference to the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Pozna≈Ñ Niziol stated: \\"It was, of course, a great satisfaction [to win the competition], as the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition is regarded in our country [in Poland] as one of the most important artistic events. But, unfortunately, I must sincerely say that winning the First Prize in Pozna≈Ñ doesn't bring many profits. Naturally, I was noticed in the country [in Poland], I gained some prestige, but nothing matters as, actually, I had only a few subsequent concerts, and exclusively in the country (...)\\".This quote comes from: Ibidem, page 25.  Career development  Niziol has performed as a soloist with many renowned orchestras: Tonhalle Orchester Zurich, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, English Chamber Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, North German Radio Symphony Orchestra, Southwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra, New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra, Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, Sinfonia Helvetica, Sinfonia Varsovia, in many famous concert halls: Barbican Centre in London (upon the invitation of Yehudi Menuhin), Salle Pleyel in Paris, Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris, Schauspielhaus in Berlin, Suntory Hall in Tokyo. He has collaborated with many famous conductors: Yehudi Menuhin, Jan Krenz, Marek Janowski, David Zinman, Heinrich Schiff, Grzegorz Nowak, Jacek Kaspszyk, Wojciech Michniewski, Andrey Boreyko, Yoav Talmi, Philippe Entremont. Niziol has participated in music festivals, the most important being: MIDEM in Cannes (where his interpretation of Wieniawski‚Äôs Violin Concerto No. 2 (Wieniawski) received an enthusiastic reception), Festival de Radio France et Montpellier in Montpelier, ‚ÄúZino Francescatti‚Äù Violin Festival, Festival de Carcassone and ‚ÄúMusique et Amiti√©‚Äù in Switzerland. He has also appeared on Europalia Poland 2001 in Belgium, Warsaw Autumn in Poland and Musica Polonica Nova in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland (2006).  Various musical activities  From 1997 to 2003, Niziol was concertmaster of the Tonhalle Orchester Zurich. As he himself stated in an interview for Polish Radio (broadcast on January 5, 2009), ‚Äúmany of the best violinists, such as Joseph Joachim or Ysa√øe, for example, were all concertmasters in various orchestras.‚Äù Niziol added that he does not agree with a new image of ‚Äúonly-virtuoso violinist who doesn‚Äôt perform in ensembles.‚Äù Since 2003 Niziol has been concertmaster of the Zurich Opera. Niziol is the founder of the Niziol Quartet. Their debut took place on the October 5, 2000 at the Tonhalle Zurich (sold out). On Niziol's official website we can read: \\"The Niziol Quartet performs with passion, virtuosity and a wide palette of tone colours and touches its audience through the depth of its playing. Its members are from Poland, United States, Switzerland and Russia. They came together as players in the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra\\".After: http://www.bartekniziol.com/quartet.htm . The Niziol Quartet has recorded two albums, the second of them including String Quartets by Paul Juon (world premiere recording). In 2007 the Stradivari Quartet was founded in Z√ºrich where Niziol plays 1st violin. To find four Stradivarius instruments in one quartet is very rare. In fact, there are just two such quartets worldwide: the Tokyo String Quartet (founded in New York in 1969) and the Stradivari Quartet. In May 2008, the two quartets together performed the Octet in E-flat, Op. 20 by Felix Mendelssohn. The quartet has signed a contract with the prestigious mark of SONY. Their debut disc will include String Quartets, Op. 50 by Joseph Haydn and is due to appear in 2009. Apart from the two quartets, Niziol gives regular recitals and sonata evenings in many prestigious venues, also appearing with different ensembles: he has performed with Pinchas Zukerman, Elisabeth Leonskaja, the Imperial Piano Trio & the Limming Ensemble. He has also formed a part-time trio with the Yofin Ensemble, including Konstantin Timokhine (natural horn) and Daniela Timokhine (piano, organ). Their recording of Esquisse by Georges Barboteu can be found on YouTube. Niziol has also collaborated with the renowned film music composer Vladimir Cosma (performing his ‚ÄúConcerto de Berlin‚Äù).  Repertoire  Niziol's repertoire includes a few dozen violin concertos, from J.S. Bach and Vivaldi to Penderecki, whose 2nd Violin Concerto was performed at the Warsaw Autumn with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra under Jan Krenz.See more: http://www.bartekniziol.com/repertoire.htm .  Teaching activities  In October 2006 Niziol was a member of the jury of the 13th Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition, the youngest juror in the history of this competition (he was 32 years old). As we can read on the site of the Henryk Wieniawski Musical Society of Pozna≈Ñ, \\"assisted by a group of domestic and international consultants, as well as the Board of the Wieniawski Society of Pozna≈Ñ, Konstanty Andrzej Kulka, one of the most illustrious Polish musical artists prepared the competition. With Wanda Wilkomirska and Bartlomiej Niziol, who represent two very different generations of the Competition‚Äôs laureates, and eight other international violin luminaries, he looked for young virtuosos most worthy of the Wieniawski 2006 laurel\\".After: http://www.wieniawski.pl/en/d416/ . Since autumn 2008 Niziol has been teaching at the Musikhochschule in Bern (Switzerland). As he himself claims (in an interview with Polish Radio), his professional motto is: \\"I don't want to force anybody to play in the same way as I do, to imitate my playing. I try to show many different ways of playing - while teaching I always play - and it's the student who must choose.\\" Between the 13 and 19 July 2009, Niziol served as lecturer and artistic director of the first MasterClass edition in Pi≈Ça (in Poland) - the \\"masterly review of musical personalities\\", including the violin, the alto, the cello & the double bass.See more: http://www.masterclass.pila.pl/ . The other professors were Michel Willi (Switzerland), David Greenlees (Great Britain), Alexander Neustroev (Russia) & Dariusz Mizera (Poland). Each day of courses was concluded with a concert evening with pupils in the leading role. One of them was Agata Szymczewska, the winner of the First Prize at the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition in Pozna≈Ñ in 2006.  Instruments played  At the beginning of his career, Niziol played a contemporary violin. When recording his debut solo CD for DUX (Polish label), he played a Giovanni Paolo Maggini violin (1996). From 1997 to 2003 Niziol played the Stradivarius ‚ÄúWieniawski‚Äù from 1719 (which belonged itself to the 19th century Polish virtuoso and composer Henryk Wieniawski). Since 2003 he has performed on the Guarneri del Ges√π from 1727 and since 2007 he also has played the Stradivarius ‚ÄúAurea‚Äù (which means \\"Golden\\") from 1715.  Summary  Today Niziol, playing as a soloist, as concertmaster of the Zurich opera house orchestra, and the first violinist of two quartets, is probably one of the most creative violinists in the world. In his free time, his family ‚Äúplays first fiddle‚Äù, and he is a hands-on father and husband.  Recordings  For his recordings, Niziol has received three Fryderyk awards: for the discs with Wieniawski (DUX, 1996), Bacewicz (DUX, 2005) & Ysaye (MVCD, 2010). Niziol's interpretation of the Violin Concerto (Brahms) in D, Op. 77 by Brahms is considered, alongside that of David Oistrakh, as one of the most interesting in the history of recordings.After: http://www.twojamuza.pl/sklep/html/?page=shop/flypage&product;_id=81&category;_id=61a8c104c3375f6b096da11f0ff130e1&. In the Daily Telegraph we could read about this interpretation: \\"(...) There is something exhilarating about a musician who takes risks, within the stylistic orbit of the music he is playing. Niziol did that in the Brahms Concerto. It was a fascinating performance, full of colour and light and tonal variety, breadth and command, and he showed every sign of developing into a violinist of exceptional stature (...)\\".After: http://www.bartekniziol.com/.

Wilms voyaged to South Africa on the same boat as Bachmann, arriving in Cape Town on 4 July 1883. Bachmann disembarked and Wilms sailed on to Durban. He travelled by train to Pietermaritzburg where he started collecting. From here he made use of an ox-wagon to get to Greytown and northwest to Ladysmith, crossing the Natal Drakensberg at Laing's Nek on 17 November 1883. From here he travelled north to Pretoria, east to Bronkhorstspruit and further east to Lydenburg which was to be his headquarters for the next 13 years. Using Lydenburg as his base, he made a number of collecting trips. He also ventured through the malaria-infested coastal flats of Portuguese East Africa to reach Delagoa Bay, choosing the winter season when there were fewer mosquitoes about. In 1896 he returned to Germany with an extensive collection of mosses, lichens, ferns and phanerogams. His paper of 1898 entitled \\"Ein botanischer Ausflug ins Boerenland\\" which appeared in Verh.

Born 1936 in Nangchen, Kham, he is believed to be an incarnation of Siddha Gar Chodingpa, a heart- disciple of Jigten Sumg√∂n, founder of the Drikung Kagyu lineage in the thirteenth century CE. He is also believed to have incarnated as Mahasiddha Aryadeva in ancient India - the lotus-born disciple of Nagarjuna himself. He was known as Lonpo Gar, the minister of Tibetan dharma king Songtsen Gampo in the seventh century CE. Life Garchen Rinpoche was seven years old he when he was brought to Lho Miyal Monastery and given the ordination name of K√∂nchok Gyaltsen (Tib. ‡Ωë‡ΩÄ‡Ωº‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωò‡ΩÜ‡Ωº‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æí‡æ±‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ωò‡Ωö‡Ωì‡ºã, ). There he was recognized by the former Drikung Kyabgon Zhiwe Lodro where he was instructed by Siddha Chime Dorje. When he was 22 he was imprisoned by the Chinese for 20 years and put in a labor camp during the Cultural Revolution. During that time he met with Khenpo Munsel who became his root guru. Khenpo Munsel was a Nyingma master who taught him during the whole 20 years of his imprisonment. During that time, while enduring the labor camp hardships, Garchen Rinpoche kept on practicing in secret, according to his guru's instructions until he achieved the wisdom-mind which Khenpo Musel called \\"an emanation of a Bodhisattva\\". Garchen Rinpoche was released from prison in 1979. As soon as he was released, he took it upon himself to rebuild the Drikung Kagyu monasteries, reestablish the Buddhist teachings, and build two boarding schools for local children in eastern Tibet. Garchen Rinpoche first came to North America in 1997, teaching in Canada and the United States. Current activities and expertise Garchen Rinpoche is the founder and spiritual director of the Garchen Buddhist Institute in Chino Valley, Arizona, the Drikung Mahayana Center in North Potomac, Maryland and Gar Drolma Choling in Dayton, Ohio. Rinpoche is also the spiritual director of many other Dharma centers and teaches throughout North America, Asia, and Europe. Rinpoche is a master of , the fivefold practice Mahamudra, the Six Yogas of Naropa, and the preliminary practices (Tib. ).

Early life Mary Goelet was born in 1878. Her parents were Mary Wilson Goelet (1855‚Äì1929) and Ogden Goelet (1851‚Äì1897), a prominent heir and landlord in New York City and great-grandson of Peter Goelet, heir to one of the largest fortunes of the time. Her only sibling was her younger brother, Robert Wilson Goelet, who built Glenmere mansion. Through her mother, she was a niece of Richard Thornton Wilson, Jr. (1866‚Äì1929) and Grace Graham Wilson Vanderbilt (1870‚Äì1953) and Cornelius Vanderbilt III. Through her father, she was a niece of Robert Goelet, a first cousin of Robert Walton Goelet, and a granddaughter of Robert Goelet Sr., a co-founder of the Chemical Bank of New York. Personal life In 1897, she was rumored to be engaged to William Montagu (1877‚Äì1947), the 20-year-old 9th Duke of Manchester. He later married a different American girl, Helena Zimmerman, the daughter of Eugene Zimmerman of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1900. On November 10, 1903, she married Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe (1876‚Äì1932).

Greenstone is another name for this stone and it is often used for parts of buildings such as doorways so they can be finely carved. Most of the elvan quarries are now disused.

Bachmann was born in Lissa, present-day Leszno, Poland. studied in Breslau with Adolf Engler and in W√ºrzburg where he was awarded an M.D. in 1883. He arrived in the Cape on 4 July 1883 in the company of Friedrich Wilms and disembarked while Wilms carried on to Durban. Bachmann spent the next four years practising medicine in the Western Cape, spending two years in Darling and the remainder in Hopefield. In November 1887 he left for Natal aboard the Trojan and stayed for a year in Pondoland where he acted as agent for Berlinsche Pondo Gesellschaft, writing a report on the natural resources there and trying to acquire land for a German agricultural settlement, a venture which was never realised. He wrote an account of his experiences \\"Reisen, Erlebnisse und Beobachtungen in der Kapkolonie, Natal und Pondoland\\", published in 1901 in Berlin, but of scant botanical importance. His first trip went from Durban to Pietermaritzburg, across the Ixopo and Umzimkulu Rivers to Clydesdale Mission. His return route crossed the Ibisi River near Harding where he called at the Marburg Mission before getting back to Durban via a boat from Port Shepstone. His second journey started off on 15 January 1888 when he left on horseback from Marburg Mission with Conrad Beyrich. They went via Flagstaff to Lusikisiki, visiting Qawukeni or Qaukeni, the kraal of the Paramount Chief of the Pondo people. From there they went through to the Egossa Forest and on to Port St Johns. Establishing a camp at the ill-fated Port Grosvenor, he made a short excursion to the Mateku Falls on a tributary of the Umsikaba River. He reached Durban in November 1888 and embarked on a boat calling at Port Elizabeth and Cape Town en route to Berlin where he arrived in January 1889.Botanical Exploration of Southern Africa - Gunn & Codd Besides flowering plants he collected some fungi, lichens and mosses, and various natural history specimens.

He was originated by Diego Serrano on December 18, 2001, before being replaced by former model Greg Vaughan in April 2002. Vaughan was let go as well, and the character departed on February 17, 2003.  Casting and creation  Diego Serrano's casting for the part was announced on October 26, 2001. Serrano was previously known for his portrayal of Tomas Rivera on the NBC Daytime soap opera, Another World. Diego made his first on- screen appearance during the episode dated December 18, 2001. On March 17, 2002, it was announced that Serrano was to exit the role, and his departure was \\"storyline dictated\\". Seven days later, it was announced that former model Greg Vaughan was Serrano's replacement. Vaughan was known for playing Dan Gordon on the serial drama series Charmed from 1999‚Äì2000. The recasting, according to executive producers, was due to a \\"new direction\\" they were taking with the character. Serrano exited on April 26, 2002 with Vaughan debuting four days later on April 30. In December, it was announced that Vaughan had been let go from The Young and the Restless. His exit was reportedly due to a \\"lack of storyline\\". A spokesperson for the soap opera said \\"Greg's a fine actor. And we thank him for all the contributions he's made to the show. It was the end of contract and end of storyline\\". His last airdate was February 17, 2003. Character development  When the casting call for the character was issued, Diego was originally named Dante; but Dante was later revealed to be his brother. He was penned as a \\"gorgeous, Hispanic male\\" in his mid twenties. He's \\"genuine and caring\\" but has learned to \\"sail through life on his good looks\\". He was introduced as the brother of another character, Raul Guittierez (David Lago). Candace Havens of Zap2it called Diego \\"sexy\\". Vaughan commented that Diego's character has developed and come a long way. He stated \\"Diego has come a long way. I find him very very passionate about his family and his loved ones.\\" The actor noted Diego to be \\"selfless and willing\\" to put his life \\"on the line to make life better or safer for someone else\\". On Vaughan's first episode on the show, Diego slept with Sharon Newman (Sharon Case). Sharon was married to Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) at the time. Sharon had believed that Nick cheated on her, which he didn't, and she became guilt ridden. Diego \\"urged\\" Sharon not to tell Nick about their lovemaking because of the ramifications it could cause where her kids with Nick were concerned. Intrigued by Diego, Nick's sister Victoria (Heather Tom) took an interest in him and they began having a romance of their own. On the night Victoria and Diego told each other they loved one another for the first time, Nick found out about his sleeping with Sharon and beat up Diego. The Newmans began to hate Diego, but Victoria forgave him. Diego was later beaten up by thugs. Despite the character's duration on the soap having eventually come to a quick close, on what was to be expected from Diego, Vaughan said \\"I think there is a lot more in store for him, and we may begin to see a bit of a darker side of him. After being pushed around and beaten up, he finally retaliates, and it's something I've been waiting to see from him\\". After Diego's obsession for revenge over the thugs got out of hand, Victoria dumped him and he left town.  Storylines  After being absent from his family's lives for a long time, Diego Guittierez came to Genoa City to find out more about his brother Raul's diabetes problems. Raul refused to let Diego help him out when his grades started going down. Diego struggled to get around town at first, but he found help from Larry Warton (David Fralick) in getting an apartment, while married couple Nick and Sharon Newman gave him a job at their coffeehouse and working on the Newman ranch. Diego regularly found himself comforting Sharon, who was having trouble dealing with her problems. Her marriage to Nick suffered when she lost a baby and caught him kissing another woman, so she wanted something more than just comfort from Diego, but he refused to do anything and said he was only her friend nothing more. However, Diego and Sharon ended up sleeping together, then were left guilty when Nick decided to work on his marriage to Sharon. Nick's sister Victoria Newman was confused about the friendship between Sharon and Diego, so she decided to pretend to be interested in Diego in order to find out more about the situations. She, however, ended up falling for him and they started a relationship. Just as they were ready to confess their love for each other, Nick found out about Sharon sleeping with Diego and he beat up Diego, then cheated on Sharon again. Victoria broke up with Diego. Diego desperately tried to convince the entire family that the night he spent with Sharon meant nothing to him and that he wasn't the one who initiated it. Victoria believed him and they hooked up again. Victoria's family wouldn't tolerate her being with Diego, so she moved out of the ranch, and the couple moved into a hotel together. Victoria's father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) tried to pay off Diego to leave town, but he wouldn't accept it. Victor gave Diego money, which was later stolen by two thugs who beat up Diego. Diego recovered from his injuries and was keen on getting revenge for the crime against him, completely ignoring the fact that Victoria wanted to lead a normal life with him. Diego hatched a plot with Larry to get revenge on the thugs and it worked. Victoria was upset over how different Diego had become and they split, causing Diego to leave Genoa City behind.

It causes a white rot of dead hardwoods. Found on sticks and decaying logs, its distinguishing features are its yellowish to orange scaly cap, and the hexagonal or diamond-shaped pores. It is widely distributed in North America, and also found in Asia, Australia, and Europe. Taxonomy The first scientific description of the fungus was published in 1815 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, under the name Merulius alveolaris. A few years later in 1821 it was sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries as Cantharellus alveolaris. It was transferred to the genus Polyporus in a 1941 publication by Appollinaris Semenovich Bondartsev and Rolf Singer. The genus name is derived from the Greek meaning \\"many pores\\", while the specific epithet alveolaris means \\"with small pits or hollows\\". Description The hexagonal pores are a characteristic feature The fruit bodies of P. alveolaris are in diameter, rounded to kidney- or fan-shaped. Fruit bodies sometimes have stems, but they are also found attached directly to the growing surface. The cap surface is dry, covered with silk-like fibrils, and is an orange-yellow or reddish-orange color, which weathers to cream to white. The context is thin (2 mm), tough, and white. Tubes are radially elongates, with the pore walls breaking down in age. The pores are large‚Äîcompared to other species in this genus‚Äîtypically 0.5‚Äì3 mm wide, angular (diamond-shaped) or hexagonal; the pore surface is a white to buff color. The stipe, if present, is 0.5‚Äì2 cm long by 1.5‚Äì5 mm thick, placed either laterally or centrally, and has a white to tan color. The pores extend decurrently on the stipe. The spore deposit is white. Microscopic features Spores are narrowly elliptical and smooth, hyaline, with dimensions of 11‚Äì14.5 √ó 4‚Äì5 ¬µm. The basidia are club-shaped and four- spored, with dimensions of 28‚Äì42 √ó 7‚Äì9 ¬µm. Similar species Polyporus craterellus bears a resemblance to P. alveolaris, but the former species has a more prominent stalk and does not have the reddish-orange colors observed in the latter. Edibility This mushroom is described as \\"edible but tough,\\" with toughness increasing with age, and not having \\"all that distinctive of a flavor.\\" Another reference lists the species as inedible. Habitat and distribution Polyporus alveolaris is found growing singly or grouped together on branches and twigs of hardwoods, commonly on shagbark hickory in the spring and early summer. It has been reported growing on the dead hardwoods of genera Acer,Castanea, Cornus, Corylus, Cratageus, Erica, Fagus, Fraxinus, Juglans, Magnolia, Morus, Populus, Pyrus, Robinia, Quercus, Syringa, Tilia, and Ulmus. This species is widely distributed in North America, and has also been collected in Australia, China, and Europe (Czechoslovakia, Italy and Portugal). Antifungal compounds A polypeptide with antifungal properties has been isolated from the fresh fruit bodies of this species. Named alveolarin, it inhibits the growth of the species Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Mycosphaerella arachidicola, and Physalospora piricola.

Six sub-centres were started in the interior forest area, geographically wide apart from the main hospital; three are still functional. The early years of the project entailed a massive struggle in the difficult conditions of a thick and remote forest. The centre, started in 1973, has recently developed into a full-fledged hospital of 40 beds and caters to over 45,000 patients annually. At Hemalkasa the hospital is ensconced in the surrounding dense forest, where the Madia Gond tribal patients feel most comfortable in recuperating.

He was portrayed by Quinn Redeker from July 1987 to the character's exit in December 1994. He later reprised the role in July 2004 for a one-episode guest appearance. Casting Redeker signed on to portray Rex on The Young and the Restless just before departing his role of Alex Marshall on Days of Our Lives, where he last aired on July 23, 1987. Previously, he portrayed Nick Reed, the abusive father of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott), for five weeks in 1979. Redeker portrayed the role from July 1987 to the character's death onscreen in December 1994. A year prior to his exit, Redeker was vocal in his lack of screen time. The character and actor's exit left a large hole, with his co-star Jeanne Cooper (who played his widow Katherine Chancellor) stating: \\"When Rex died, I didn't want to go onto my set for two months. I was depressed for two months after he died.\\" Redeker later reprised the role on July 6, 2004, when he reappeared to an inebriated Katherine. Characterization Rex evolved into a wealthy businessman. Storylines When Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton) found Rex Sterling on a park bench and paid him to seduce her enemy Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), she had no idea that his real name was Brian Romalotti. He was the father of Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and Gina Roma (Patty Weaver), a con man that did time for the crimes he had committed with his wife. Rex did his job wonderfully and his relationship to Katherine suddenly turned into a romance. Kay found out the truth about Jill's job, but she didn't care. Rex even decided to sign a pre-nuptial agreement to prove to Kay that she should trust him. Rex was stunned when Kay suddenly started to act strange and he couldn't take it anymore, so he decided to move out and move in with Jill, who then tried to make him divorce Kay and marry her. Rex had no idea that Kay was actually Marge Cotrooke (Jeanne Cooper), Kay's look-alike hired by his former cellmate Clint Radison (James Michael Gregary) to take over Kay's identity. During her tenure as Kay, Marge sold Chancellor industries and Clint was able to control Kay's assets, but not for long. Kay's son Brock and lawyer Mitchell were able to get rid of Clint in time. Rex married Jill during Katherine's absence, but Kay was able to prove that their marriage wasn't legal because Marge had signed the divorce papers, not her. Rex and Jill were, however, apparently in love, so Kay decided to respect that. Jill found her way back into the arms of her former husband John Abbott (Jerry Douglas), while Rex got interested in Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton). Kay found out about their affair and revealed everything in a party she held. Rex and Kay eventually remarried while Rex was pretending to be dying from a heart attack. Their lives were perfect at that moment. However, things changed when Kay's maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder) started dating Norman Peterson (Mark Haining) and had no idea he was a con man. Kay and Rex agreed to go along with Esther's plan to pretend to be the owner of the mansion to impress Norman. Norman eventually found out and asked Esther to convince Kay to include her in her will. Rex and Kay found it strange when Norman proposed marriage to Esther, so they faked a wedding. Norman wasn't satisfied and he broke into the house safe only to be caught by Rex. In order to cover his tracks, Norman shot Rex to death. In 2004, when Kay started drinking again, she passed out and dreamt of Rex and Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz) appearing before her and encouraging her to stop drinking.

James McGready (1763‚Äì1817) was a Presbyterian minister and a revivalist during the Second Great Awakening in the United States of America. He was one of the most important figures of the Second Great Awakening in the American frontier.  Early life  McGready was of British descent, and was born in Pennsylvania. When he was quite young, his father moved from Pennsylvania, and settled in Guilford County, North Carolina. An uncle, who was on a visit to his father's family, from Pennsylvania, thought that the boy's character fitted him to be educated for the ministry, and asked his parents to allow their son to accompany him back to Pennsylvania. About the time of his commencing his studies preparatory to the work of the ministry, he was convinced by a sermon of a certain Reverend Smith, of the unsoundness of his previous religious convictions. Smith, in his history of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, says that his religious awakening was attributable to a conversation of two friends, overheard by McGready, in which they expressed their fears that he was not a truly converted man. Foote, in his Sketches of North Carolina, confirms the latter account.  Revival  In the fall of 1785, Mr. Smith, who, according to the first tradition, was the means of his awakening, opened a school for the purpose of assisting young men in preparing for the ministry, and young McGready immediately became one of his pupils. He remained here for some time, and then entered a school recently opened by Rev. Dr. John McMillan, with whom he had spent some time after his arrival with his uncle from North Carolina. Dr. McMillan's school grew into what is now Washington & Jefferson College. When McGready had completed his literary and theological studies, he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Redstone, on August 13, 1788, when he was about thirty years of age. In the following autumn or winter, he returned to North Carolina, and on his way spent some time with Dr. John Blair Smith, at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. Dr. Smith had been connected with a powerful religious revival that occurred in his neighborhood about that time, and McGready seems to have been deeply affected by what he saw and heard of that revival.  Ministry  On his arrival in North Carolina, he found the churches in an unsatisfactory state. His preaching was the means of awakening increased interest on the subject of religion. According to one account: \\"His labors at an academy under the care of Dr. Caldwell, were instrumental in producing a revival of religion, in which ten or twelve young men were brought into the fold, all of whom became ministers of the gospel, and some of them were subsequently his fellow- laborers in the far West.\\" About the year 1790 McGready married, and became the pastor of a congregation in Orange County. \\"Here he labored with his wonted zeal, and often with great success.\\" His zeal provoked opposition, and he was accused of distracting people from their labors and creating unnecessary alarm among decent and orderly people. \\"A letter was written to him in blood, requiring him to leave the country at the peril of his life; and a number of wicked men and women of the baser sort, on a certain occasion during the week, assembled in his church, tore down the seats, set fire to the pulpit, and burnt it to ashes.\\" On the following Sunday, when the congregation met for worship, a scene of confusion and desolation presented itself. He, however, proceeded with the service, using a relevant and solemn psalm, and delivering a sermon from the following text: \\"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold your house is left unto you desolate.\\" In 1796 McGready left North Carolina for Kentucky. After spending a few months in East Tennessee, he reached his destination, and took the pastoral charge of three congregations in Logan County ‚Äì Gaspar River, Red River, and Muddy River. These congregations were small, and in a low state of religious interest. He presented to the members of his congregation for their approval and signatures, the following preamble and covenant: > When we consider the word and promises of a compassionate God to the poor > lost family of Adam, we find the strongest encouragement for Christians to > pray in faith--to ask in the name of Jesus for the conversion of their > fellow-men. None ever went to Christ when on earth, with the case of their > friends, that were denied, and, although the days of his humiliation are > ended, yet, for the encouragement of his people, he has left it on record, > that where two or three agree upon earth to ask in prayer, believing, it > shall be done. Again, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that > will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. With these promises > before us, we feel encouraged to unite our supplications to a prayer-hearing > God for the outpouring of his Spirit, that his people may be quickened and > comforted, and that our children, and sinners generally, may be converted. > Therefore, we bind ourselves to observe the third Saturday of each month, > for one year, as a day of fasting and prayer for the conversion of sinners > in Logan county, and throughout the world. We also engage to spend one half > hour every Saturday evening, beginning at the setting of the sun, and one > half hour every Sabbath morning, from the rising of the sun, pleading with > God to revive his work. To this covenant he and they affixed their names. The writer recollects to have heard the late Dr. Alfred M. Bryan state that his father, and perhaps his mother, were subscribers, among others. In May, 1797, the first signs of promise appeared, in the conversion of a female member of one of his congregations, who had been in the communion of the Church for some time. These favorable indications continued through the summer, but were followed by a temporary reaction through the fall and winter. The following summer the work developed itself more powerfully. On Monday of the sacramental meeting, at Gaspar River Meeting-house, the Spirit of God was poured out abundantly; the congregation became intensely interested on the subject of religion, and during the following week, almost entirely neglected their secular affairs, so great was their solicitude to secure the salvation of their own souls and the souls of others. This was the commencement of the great Revival of 1800. For several subsequent years, a history of Mr. McGready would be a history of the revival. He was its leading spirit, its most earnest advocate, and powerful promoter. When the difficulties began to develop themselves, which resulted in the organization of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, Mr. McGready for a time took a decided stand, as we would have expected, with the revival party. As these difficulties progressed, however, and became more serious than he expected, he faltered. It is, perhaps, not a matter of surprise. He was a Calvinist of the old school. He had received his early theological impressions, and his impressions of ecclesiastical order, from Dr. McMillan and old Red Stone Presbytery, types of the sternest Presbyterianism. He had no idea, it is supposed, when the troubles commenced, that they would become so complicated and embarrassing. Another consideration may be added. Although a man of great power in the pulpit, he was not a man for ecclesiastical conflict. He was not adapted to the leadership of a party. In December 1805 he was cited, with Revs. Messrs. William Hodge, William McGee, Samuel McAdow, and John Rankin, to appear before the next meeting of Kentucky Synod, to account for their conduct in not submitting the young men for reexamination to the Commission of the Synod. The history of the Commission is known. He succeeded by some means in making his peace with the Synod, and with the Transylvania Presbytery, which he seems to have attended in 1809, for the first time after his citation by the Commission of Synod. Shortly after Mr. McGready's defection from the Council out of which the Cumberland Presbytery of 1810 grew, he left Logan county, and settled in Henderson county, Kentucky, where he remained until his death, which occurred in February, 1817.  Later years  Of his later years, not much is known. It is known, however, that he continued his ministerial work, with his usual fidelity. But from some cause his labors were not as successful as they had formerly been. This was perhaps partly attributable to such a failure of physical strength and animation as declining age naturally brings. His friends, too, thought that the former unction of his ministry was wanting. It is recorded that in the fall of 1816, a few months before his death, he attended a Cumberland Presbyterian camp- meeting near Evansville, Indiana, where he preached with great power and success. At the close of a very impressive sermon on \\"The character, history, and end of the fool.\\" he came out of the pulpit, called together the anxious, and prayed for them with great fervency. When he closed, he arose from his knees, and exclaimed with a loud voice, \\"O blessed be God! I this day feel the same holy fire that filled my soul sixteen years ago, during the glorious revival of 1800.\\" References * Category:18th-century Presbyterian ministers Category:Washington & Jefferson College alumni Category:American Presbyterian ministers Category:1763 births Category:1817 deaths ","title":"James McGready"},{"id":"21519818","text":"Mother Seton House is a historic home located on the grounds of St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary at Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a -story red brick house, similar to other small homes built in the early 19th century for the predominantly French community nearby. It was built in 1808 as the home of Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774‚Äì1821), the first American-born woman beatified and canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. In the 1960s it was restored to its original appearance through the efforts of a committee, which continues to operate the home as a museum. Mother Seton House is located adjacent to the St. Mary's Seminary Chapel. In 1972, Mother Seton House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mother Seton‚Äôs connection This home on North Paca Street is most well known for its first owner, Mother Seton. She would arrive to the home in Baltimore on June 16, 1808, and stay until June 21, 1809. During her brief year in Baltimore, Seton would pay rent totaling at $250.00. Upon her arrival to the home, Elizabeth Seton was more than pleased with the house. In fact, she penned a letter to a friend, Julia Scott, describing it as a \\"‚Äòneat, delightful mansion, entirely new...in the new French style of folding windows and recesses.‚Äô\\" Despite the fact that Elizabeth Seton only inhabited the home for a year, a long-lasting bond between the two was formed. House description Prior to the home‚Äôs existence, the land was occupied by French immigrants. They used the land mainly for tobacco and wheat farming. The house was constructed during the Federal Period roughly around 1807.Baltimore American Sept. 30, 1962 By Sally Foster Although the architect of the original home is unknown, it is believed that Maximilian Godefroy was the mastermind behind the project. He was responsible for much of the designs in the surrounding buildings. Inspiration for the home was drawn from the French immigrants in what is to be known as \\"Federal Architecture.\\" As it stands, the row-home is located within St. Mary‚Äôs Park, just minutes from Downtown Baltimore.A Guide to Baltimore Architecture by John Dorsey 3rd ed. 1997 The most notable feature about the home is the 26‚Äô wide and 42‚Äô deep staircase that can be seen from the entrance. The house contains at least three bedrooms on the second floor, but there is no total room count for the entire property. Reason it was built Elizabeth Seton voiced to Bishop Carroll her wishes to reunite with her children. In an agreement formulated; Bishop Carroll would send her sons down to Baltimore, suggesting that they enroll in school at St. Mary‚Äôs College. Fortunately, the bishop himself was the president of the college; therefore he could see that her sons were admitted. The only condition that Elizabeth Seton had to follow was to \\"establish a school for young girls.\\" This was to be a boarding school which welcomed girls of all ages. This was the first instance of pioneering Catholic education in the United States. The school was funded and developed through the Daughters of Charity. After Mother Seton After Mother Seton‚Äôs departure to Emmitsburg, Maryland in the summer of 1809, the house was left vacant for some time. This property served for a variety of purposes; in the late 19th century and early 20th century the home was used as a potato bin, and a place of storage and laundry services. After receiving much negative attention for its lack of upkeep, a local women‚Äôs group initiated the restoration of the home. The current owner of the property is the Sulpician Order, which also still retains control of St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary. In the process of renovation, the house was thoroughly documented by taking photos of both the interior and exterior in order to restore the home to its full originality. At the head of renovation were Mrs. Earnshaw and Mrs. Clinton K. Macsherry with their consultant, John H. Scarff. They furnished the home with decor from the Federal time period. During this time, many were behind the full restoration of this home; in particular, it can be noted that the Order of the Alhambra gave $20,000 for the project.

It is known as the ferrovia direttissima Firenze-Roma in Italian‚Äîmeaning \\"most direct Florence‚ÄìRome railway\\" (abbreviated DD); this name reflects the naming of the Rome‚ÄìFormia‚ÄìNaples Direttissima opened in 1927 and the Bologna‚ÄìFlorence Direttissima opened in 1934. The line was the first high-speed line opened in Europe when more than half of it opened on 24 February 1977. It was completed on 26 May 1992, reducing the time of the fastest trains between the two cities to 1 hour and 20 minutes. The old line is referred to by Ferrovie dello Stato (the State Railways) as the Linea Lenta (meaning \\"slow line\\", abbreviated LL) to distinguish it from the parallel high-speed line. In 2016 a contract was let for resignalling with ETCS level 2. The line is part of Corridor 1 of the European Union's Trans-European high- speed rail network, which connects Berlin and Palermo. History The railway between Rome and Florence developed from several different lines by several different companies for different purposes and as a result was curvy and slow. Over the years there had been many studies, proposals and projects for deviations to straighten the line but nothing came of them. After World War II it was finally decided to build a new line that was straighter, faster and especially shorter () than the old Florence-Rome line; it was also to be well- integrated with the existing line, rather than replace it. The project was approved and funded in late 1968 and early 1969. This was the first high-speed rail project‚Äîin the sense that \\"high-speed\\" is now used‚Äîto be commenced in Europe. On 25 June 1970 work began on the most important element of the project: the Paglia viaduct over the Paglia river, which is made up of 205 linear spans of and five 50 metre-long arched spans and is the longest viaduct in Europe. It was expected that the first section of the line from Roma Termini to Citt√† della Pieve would take five years to complete, but it was not in fact opened until 24 February 1977. It was a milestone in the history of Italian railways, but progress was subsequently slowed by numerous obstacles, some of a political nature. The line had to be rerouted near Arezzo due to problems in driving a tunnel. The official opening took place with a train consisting of an FS Class E444 locomotive and Gran Comfort coaches. The section of line between Citt√† della Pieve and Arezzo was completed on 29 September 1985; the section between Valdarno and Florence was opened on 30 May 1986 and finally on 26 May 1992 the section between Arezzo and Valdarno was opened. Route A1 near Orte The line has a largely straight path with a maximum grade of 0.8%, no level crossings or intersections of any kind with road or rail traffic, and the centre of tracks four meters apart to counteract the dynamic effects created by trains passing each other. Communication with drivers consists of an adaptation of the Italian RS4 Codici train protection system with in-cabin repetition of signals using nine codes and earth to train telephone communication. The minimum radius of curves is , enabling an operating speed of . Connections between the two tracks in both directions every allow trains to use either track in either direction or for all operations to operate on a single track if necessary. The rails are laid using a UIC rail profile, with electrically welded rails attached to prestressed reinforced concrete sleepers, spaced apart with Pandrol clips. The interconnections between the high-speed lines and the old Florence‚ÄìBologna lines are implemented through grade-separated crossings above or below the line rather than crossing over the opposing track on the level. The switches between the two running lines are capable of supporting speeds of up to , while the 15 switches to connecting lines support speeds of up to . The line is electrified at 3 kV DC, and supplied by substations at intervals. A contract was let to Ansaldo STS to replace the signalling and train protection system with ETCS level 2 in October 2016. It is proposed to raise the maximum speed from to . It has been proposed to re-electrify the line at 25 kV AC in the past but this has been abandoned.

The station opened in 1859 and served as the terminus of the line from Dublin to Bray in County Wicklow. It closed in 1958. There is currently a Luas tram stop outside the front of the old station. History The stationed opened on 7 February 1859, after the initial opening of the railway line itself.Harcourt Street - eiretrains.com The station facade was designed by George Wilkinson, and contains a central arch and a colonnade of doric columns. The station was constructed on an embankment, with the line 25 feet above street level and a Gilbey's bonded spirits store in the undercroft.Harcourt Street station - Archiseek Although the line was double track, the station only had a single 597-foot-long (182 m) platform on the west side of the railway, which terminated in a 48'-diameter (14.6 m) turntable at the Hatch Street end of the station. There were two through sidings on the east side of the station, beyond which lay Harcourt Street goods station and the D&WR;'s locomotive shed. There was no direct access for arriving trains to the goods station, instead 'Up' Freight trains had to pull into the passenger station, then set back onto the 'Down' line before entering the goods station. This was a contributory factor to the 1900 train crash. The first signal box was installed in 1878, and was replaced with an electro-mechanical installation in 1938 at which point the station was re-signalled with colour light signals. The station is perhaps most famous for a train crash in 1900 - a cattle train from Enniscorthy failed to stop and crashed through the end wall of the station, leaving the locomotive suspended over Hatch Street. Nobody was killed, though the driver, William Hyland, had his right arm amputated. The locomotive was lowered down onto the existing DUTC tramway and moved to Harcourt Rd., then by temporary track up the goods entrance (modern Harcourt Court) to the station. Following the accident, the Board of Trade recommended the installation of a facing junction to allow direct access to the goods line, and until that took place all trains were to stop at Ranelagh to ensure that they made a controlled approach to Harcourt Street station.News , Number 32, Summer 2008, National Library of Ireland This practice continued up to its closure. After the formation of The Great Southern Railways in 1925, Harcourt Street gradually declined in importance as services to the South East were increasingly concentrated on Westland Row (now Pearse) station with goods facilities transferred to the North Wall goods station. Thereafter, apart from during the 1933 GNR(I) strike, Harcourt Street became predominately a passenger station. The station continued operating until 31 December 1958, when C√≥ras Iompair √âireann, during its rationalisation programme of the railway network, closed the line from Harcourt Street. The Luas light rail network that opened on 30 June 2004 utilised parts of the old route. The station building has been converted into a leisure venue with bars and music venues. Liquor museum In 1958, C.I.√â. opened a liquor museum in the station basement. The exit was to the station refreshment room which was, unlike most other local licensed premises, permitted to sell alcohol in the holy hour between 2pm and 3pm if customers held tickets for distances over 12 miles, namely Bray and beyond. After closure, the museum was moved to the basement of Heuston Station in 1961.

She was the mother of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi.  Life  A wedding photograph with her husband in 1892 Portrait of Mitsuko Aoyama was the daughter of Kihachi Aoyama, an antiques and oil dealer in Tokyo. The Aoyama family was also a landowner of large estates. At the age of 17, she met the Austro-Hungarian diplomat Count Heinrich von Coudenhove (from 1903, Coudenhove-Kalergi) when she came to his aid after his horse slipped on ice (Heinrich often visited her father's shop, not far from the Austrian legation). Heinrich gained her father's permission for her to be employed as a parlour maid in the legation and then, after they fell in love, asked his permission for them to marry. The latter request was refused, but the couple defied him, and married on 16 March 1892 in Tokyo with the consent of the Austrian and Japanese foreign ministries. This left Aoyama disinherited and banned from her father's house. She converted to Catholicism and was baptized by an anti-masonic Catholic priest, Francois A. Ligneul, in Japan. In 1896, she was received at an imperial reception for foreign diplomats' wives by Empress Eish≈ç (as a commoner, Mitsuko would never have been granted such an audience, but as a countess and ambassador's wife, she was) and again at the end of Heinrich's diplomatic work, shortly afterwards. The couple then returned to Europe, where Mitsuko and their two sons, Johannes and Richard, took over management of the family estates in Bohemian Ronsperg. Once established, Mitsuko learned French, German, Mathematics, geography and history in an attempt to counter the hostility to Heinrich concerning his return with a foreign wife. Five more children would be born to Heinrich and Mitsuko. Heinrich died in 1906 and Mitsuko took over the estates and the children's upbringing and education, while studying law and economics herself. When her second son Richard proposed to marry an actress, Ida Roland, Mitsuko became intensely angry and forbade their marriage. She disparaged Richard and his bride with the words \\"beggar\\" and \\"witch\\", because actresses were seen as a lowly occupation in Japan. She disinherited him in a certain period from 1916. Mitsuko never again returned to Japan. After she died in 1941 due to the second stroke she had suffered in her life, she was buried in the Hietzinger Cemetery.

However, their numbers have been bolstered significantly by new arrivals from overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and later from mainland China. There are also a few migrants from the Republic of China on Taiwan. Migration history  Origins  Beginning in 1888, the German New Guinea Company (GNGC) imported hundreds of indentured Chinese labourers each year, from Amoy (now Xiamen), Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sumatra to work on coconut and tobacco plantations. They suffered a fatality rate as high as 40% due to tropical diseases and harsh treatment. However, from 1898, the German government formally took over administration of the territory from the GNGC, and promoted free immigration instead of indentured labour. Carpenters, shipbuilders, engineers, tailors, and shopkeepers flowed into the territory, spreading out to various towns including Rabaul, Kokopo, Kavieng, Lae, and Madang. Ships regularly sailed back and forth to Hong Kong. From a population of 200 in 1890, the Chinese community grew to 1427 by 1913. Of those, just 101 were women. Australian invasion In 1914, Australia invaded and occupied New Guinea; during the occupation, which continued until 1919, they refused further entry to Chinese. In 1920, New Guinea was formally placed under Australian control as a League of Nations mandate; the new administration extended laws of Australia, in particular the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, over New Guinea, making it far more difficult for Chinese to gain entry to the territory. Chinese who had settled there before 1922 received permanent residency, but those few who arrived afterwards could only receive temporary residency. The Australians' 1921 survey of their new territory found a total of 1,424 Chinese (1,195 men, 229 women). The gender imbalance in the Chinese community would largely persist due to the policy of refusing entry to wives and children whom New Guinea-resident Chinese men had left behind in China; as a consequence, some Chinese men took indigenous women as wives instead. The children of their marriages tended to be brought up within the Chinese community. There were also roughly 100 Chinese on Papua; however, movement between New Guinea and the Papua area was restricted, so the community there remained small. A 1933 survey found just five Chinese in Papua; Filipinos formed the dominant Asian group, with a population of 88. Port Moresby had only a single Chinese family, headed by Luk Poi Wai, a tailor. By the eve of the Pacific War, the Chinese population in New Guinea exceeded 2,000. Japanese invasion After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, with the Japanese invasion of New Guinea looming just over the horizon, the Australian government moved to evacuate white women and children from the territory. However, they made no similar moves to evacuate the Chinese population there. In early 1942, in response to the pleas of community members, this stance softened slightly, and 300 Chinese were flown to Australia; however, the majority of Chinese women were refused permission to leave. Left behind to face occupation by the Imperial Japanese Army, Chinese women became victims of atrocities at a far higher rate than indigenous women. According to community leader Chin Hoi Meen, \\"Chinese girls had to be supplied to [the Japanese] on demand\\"; under threat of beatings, death, or imprisonment in a soldiers' brothel as comfort women, Chinese women were also forced to enter into relationships and cohabit with Japanese officers. Chinese men were interned in concentration camps to perform hard labour. A total of 86 local Chinese residents died during the war, 37 of those having been killed by the Japanese. Among the dead was the head of the PNG branch of the Kuomintang, the main political party of the Republic of China at the time; he was executed by Japanese troops as a warning to the community. In addition to their crimes against local Chinese people, the Japanese sent about 1,600 Republic of China Army prisoners-of-war to Rabaul as slave labourers; many died and were buried there. Some soldiers of Taiwan origin came as auxiliaries with the Japanese army as well. Post-World War II In 1946, the total Chinese population in Papua and New Guinea stood at roughly 2,000 people. A new immigration policy promulgated in 1948 permitted entrance and temporary residence, in the form of exemptions from immigration restrictions, to Chinese engaged in overseas trade of a minimum volume of ¬£1,000 per year. They would also be permitted to sponsor one assistant if their trade volume reached ¬£2,500 per year, and one additional assistant for every ¬£2,500 above that threshold, whose exemptions were to be reviewed every five years, and to nominate a temporary substitute to come to PNG in their place for up to three years if they had to leave the territory. Wives of traders who had lived in the territory since 1921 were granted a permanent exemption from immigration restrictions; others were granted temporary exemptions to be reviewed at three-year intervals. Finally, their dependents who left the territory could be granted re-entry permits with a validity of as long as five years. However, World War II and the ongoing Chinese Civil War had disrupted many of the Chinese community's links to China; even after 1949, though local Chinese were able to regain contact with their relatives in China, they found it difficult to go for visits or send their children their due to the lack of diplomatic relations between Australia and the new People's Republic of China government. The 1966 census found a total of 566 persons born in China (64 men and 17 women in Papua; 297 men and 188 women in New Guinea), 288 persons holding Chinese nationality (206 men, 72 women), and 2,455 persons who responded \\"Chinese\\" when asked their race (1,391 men, 1,064 women). As late as the 1970s, local men continued to go to Hong Kong to find Chinese women to marry, and then brought them back to PNG. In the 1950s, the Australian government gave the Chinese community a choice of taking up Australian citizenship; this decision marked one of the Australian government's earliest breaks in the White Australia policy. Independence era With independence in 1975, the bulk of the Chinese community in PNG chose to depart for Australia. However, their numbers began to be bolstered again by newcomers in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with ethnic Chinese from Malaysia, from Singapore, from Indonesia, and from the Philippines arriving to work as timber merchants or traders. In the 1990s, as the local currency depreciated, their numbers decreased. However, the number of Chinese would continue to grow with the arrival of many new immigrants from the People's Republic of China, who came not just as employees of Chinese companies but also as independent traders. Community structure Politics Prior to PNG's independence, the Chinese community had no role in local administration; instead, their political participation was directed towards China. The New Guinea Branch of the Kuomintang (KMT) provided de facto leadership for the community. Though the Chinese Civil War ended with the victory of the Communist Party of China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC), most Chinese in PNG remained supporters of the Kuomintang and their Republic of China (ROC) government based on Taiwan, until the 1960s, when they began to realise that the KMT's plan to retake mainland China was unlikely to be realised. However, their fears of being labelled as communists led them to maintain at least public loyalty to Taiwan well after that, flying the flag of the Republic of China and continuing to send representatives to the ROC's National Assembly in Taipei until Australia's recognition of the PRC in 1972. After independence, some of the Chinese who held PNG nationality became involved in local politics, primarily as fundraisers or middlemen for major politicians. A few, especially those of mixed blood, attained prominent positions in the government; the best known example is former prime minister Sir Julius Chan. Business and employment Due to the bureaucracy and delays involved in obtaining a work permit for foreigners, many companies bring in workers from China illegally, with some estimates suggesting as many as 300 Chinese people arrive each week without proper documentation. Organisations Migrants formed surname and hometown associations in Rabaul during the late 1910s and early 1920s. Port Moresby, in contrast, lacks any such association, due to the diversity and short history of the Chinese community there. Local Chinese there formed one social club, the Cathay Club, in the 1960s; some new Chinese immigrants have joined as well. They typically organise sports and games for their members. Education In Rabaul, there were two Chinese schools, each associated with a Christian denomination and established with teachers specially hired from China. The Overseas Chinese School (ËèØÂÉëÂ≠∏Ê†°) was established with support from the Methodist missionaries in 1922, while St. Theresa's Yang Ching School (È§äÊ≠£Â≠∏Ê†°) was set up two years later by Chinese community leaders with support from the Catholic Church. Chinese schools also sprang up in Madang and Kavieng. Many families also sent their children back to China for further studies, but this practise came to an end due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and did not resume after peace returned. The wealthiest members of the community were also able to send their children to Australia for further studies. In the 1950s, subsidies from the Australian government allowed an increasing number of Chinese from New Guinea to attend Australian universities. Their primary destinations were Queensland and New South Wales. Culture Language Most early Chinese immigrants traced their roots to southern coastal regions of China, especially Guangdong; Siyi dialect became the lingua franca among them, though others spoke various dialects of Cantonese or Hakka As a result, many younger ethnic Chinese have forgotten the language, or never learned it. Starting in the 1970s, many Chinese families hired indigenous women as nannies, who then taught Tok Pisin to the children. Religion Most Chinese in Papua New Guinea are at least nominally Christian. The German colonial era saw the first Chinese converts to Catholicism. Chinese Catholic and Methodist churches have been operating in Rabaul since the 1920s. In contrast, there is only one Buddhist temple in PNG, the Manjusri Buddhist Centre (ÊõºÁè†Á≤æËàç) in Port Moresby, established in 1994 by Malaysian Chinese expatriates and now operated by the Taiwan-based Fo Guang Shan order; they generally conduct sermons in Mandarin. Ethnicity and identity Due to gender imbalances, mixed marriages between Chinese men and indigenous women have long been common in PNG's Chinese community. The offspring of such marriages tended to be accepted as Chinese if they were raised within the community and learned the language. However, at the same time, the Chinese community tended to look down on indigenous people as \\"savages\\"; prior to independence, Chinese were in the middle tier of a racial hierarchy, discriminated against by whites but equally lording it over the indigenous people; after independence, they came to resent the political power those same indigenes had been given over them. Even within the Chinese community, tensions exist between different groups of immigrants. Local Chinese in particular blame mainland Chinese for disrupting previously-peaceful inter- ethnic relationships between the Chinese community and indigenous peoples. In particular, mainland Chinese migrants' activities have earned them a poor reputation not just among indigenous people, but among local Chinese and ethnic Chinese expatriates from Southeast Asia as well; the latter view them as \\"crooks\\" and \\"conmen\\". Mainland Chinese migrants' practise of illegally opening shops in sectors which are restricted to PNG nationals, such as low- end hospitality and retail businesses; these bring them into direct economic competition with local people. For example, during September 2007 anti-Chinese riots in Mount Hagen, PNG's third largest city, Chinese-owned warehouses became targets for arsonists and armed robbers.

It directs boats towards the entrance to the Macleay River, which is located just to the north of the lighthouse. It is one of the last major lighthouse complexes designed by the New South Wales colonial architect of the time, James Barnet, and was one of Australia's last lighthouses to be designed for architectural excellence. Standing on a granite headland above the sea, its light is the highest in New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The South West Rocks area was well known for many years because of its prominent coastal geography. A journal entry recorded on Sunday May 13, 1770 by Captain James Cook describes a point \\"or a head land, on which we saw fires that produced a great quantity of smoke, bore W. distant four leagues. To this point, I gave the name of Smoky Cape; it is of a considerable height, and over the pitch of the Point, is a round hillock; within it are two others, much higher and larger and within them the land is very low\\". Earliest European contact was not until 1816, when the brig, Trial, hijacked by convicts was wrecked at Trial Bay. Subsequently, explorer John Oxley visited the area in 1817. Trial Bay was noted early as a valuable haven for passing ships during southerly gales because of its northerly aspect and position midway between Sydney and Brisbane. Shipping was the primary mode of trade and transport for the eastern seaboard communities. More than twenty wrecks have occurred in the area of the headland, several of them with losses of life. Three men died when the ketch Woolloomooloo was wrecked in Trial Bay in 1864 and nine died in the wreck of the brig Annie Ogle in 1875. A number of ships have been wrecked in the Bay area with more lost around the headland and immediate coastline. The first action to establish a light at Smoky Cape was taken by Alexander Kethel, member for West Sydney in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, who in 1886 passed a resolution stating that, for the benefit of the increasing coast trade and navigation it was necessary to erect a lighthouse at Smoky Cape. A sum of 18,000 pounds was set aside for the construction of the complex. The Colonial Architect, James Barnet, who played an important role in the design and construction of lights at South Solitary Island, Montague Island and Green Cape, selected the site and prepared the necessary documentation. During the design stage major changes in organisation occurred. James Barnet was dismissed in 1890 and the office of the Colonial Architect was replaced with that of Government Architect. The project was then handed to C. W. Darley, Engineer-in-Chief for Harbours and Rivers. Barnets original design was however used for the Lighthouse. Tenders for the work were called in January 1889 and the offer from Messrs. Oakes and Company was successful. The contract called for the construction of the tower and annex, the head keeper's residence and semi detached assistant keepers cottages, a coach house and stables. All were to be erected on an 81 acres reserve, 128 metres above sea level. By 1889 construction was well underway and a notice was given to mariner's informing them of the construction of the lighthouse with full particulars coming at a later date. It was reported the contractor, a Mr Oakes died during the construction of the complex, however it was completed by his heirs within budget. The light was first exhibited on the 15 April 1891. The official ceremony, attended by Darley and members of the Marine Board, taking place on the 29 April 1891. In 1912 the original light source was replaced and in 1962 was changed again to an electric lamp and new thrust bearing pedestal system. As a result of the Commonwealth Lighthouses Act of 1911, management of the lighthouse was transferred in 1915 to Federal control because of its status as a coastal light. Since 1939, the lighthouse has been an Australian Bureau of Meteorology site for the gathering of climate statistics. During the World War 2, the lighthouse precinct was used for military purposes. There was a searchlight battery and light gun emplacement, and possibly a radio room, operating there at that time. The concrete remains of the military installation are still visible. In 1962 the light was electrified and around 1988 it was automated. The optic system is still the original first order Fresnel lens. On May 14, 1998, Smoky Cape was the first NSW Parks and Wildlife Service lighthouse to be opened for tours.Lighthouses of Australia. June 1998 Bulletin Design Lighthouse plans, 1888 Keepers' quarters plans, 1888 Plan of site, 1888 The lighthouse's design is unusual for its octagonal tower, and was so designed because it was easier to cast the tower in the octagonal formwork than round formwork. It has a single story pavilion entrance, cast iron staircase and distinctive gunmetal balustrade.Smoky Cape Lighthouse It is one of only three nineteenth century mass concrete lighthouses in NSW (the others being South Solitary Island Lighthouse and Green Cape Lighthouse). The fact that it has its original Chance Brothers revolving apparatus and lens, and lantern house, makes it an important example of late nineteenth century industrial maritime technology.  Description   Context  Smoky Cape is located to the south east of South West Rocks a seaside resort town situated at the mouth of the Macleay River, 35 kilometres north east of Kempsey and midway between Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie. South West Rocks has a variety of beaches facing in different directions. East of the township is Laggers Point which extends north west with a west facing beach at its base. Southeast of the point are a number of small protected beaches such as Horseshoe Bay and Little Bay. Gap Beach and North Smoky are long stretches of forest fringed beaches. Trial Bay Gaol, which occupies Laggers Point is a prominent tourist attraction dating from the same period as Smoky Cape. The Lighthouse is sited on the top of a bluff, which then falls away to the sea below. The support buildings are set below and behind the lighthouse for more protection from adverse weather. The main cottage and two assistants cottages are sited on level platforms, cut into the steep slopes and stabilised by high concrete retaining walls. The stables are set well below the cottages, near the entry to the precinct. The site rises steeply from the carpark to the Lighthouse and its narrow pathway is known as \\"Heart Attack Hill\\". There is little on site car parking. Cars presently can drive up a narrow driveway, but must traverse all the way up the lighthouse forecourt before turning around and descending to the small grassed plot in front of the Head Lighthouse keeper's cottage Buildings and structures The Lighthouse Precinct consists of: * Lighthouse and attached engine room * Signal House * Headkeepers Cottage * Two attached Assistant keepers cottages * Former Stables buildings * Garage * Small freestanding office/weather station * Small flag room and several former fuel stores. An historic view of the lighthouse =The Lighthouse Tower= The Lighthouse is octagonal with large single storey entry pavilion. Constructed in mass concrete the tower is 17.4 metres tall and has a Chance Bros. lantern and lens. Cast iron stairs lead up to the gallery level. An early description of the tower refers to two storeys with iron floors and staircases and walls of mass concrete. The gallery round lantern is of granite supported on moulded granite cantilevers with gun metal railing. The tower is entered from an enclosed passage protected by a screen wall which is constructed around the base of the structure. The floors of the storerooms are paved in concrete and cemented. The tower is divided into two storeys with iron floors and staircases. The walls are 920mm thick at the base and taper to 620mm at the top and are constructed of mass concrete using locally mined granite as the aggregate and are cemented externally and internally. The gallery floor of the lantern is formed of granite voussoir blocks supported on molded granite brackets. An ornate metal railing featuring Queen Victoria's mark is used for the handrailing at this level. The tower walls feature a number of openings including a light opening located below the balcony which housed a subsidiary red light to cover Fish Rock. The tower is entered from an enclosed passage which also accesses the two store rooms and are also constructed of mass concrete. A screen wall also of mass concrete is built around the tower. The ground floor rooms were originally used as store and work room. In 1912 the original burner was replaced by an incandescent vaporised kerosene burner. Again in 1962 the light was altered to a mains electric operation with an increased power. The structure has also undergone a number of other fabric alterations including the roofing to the pavilion which was replaced in zincalume in 1990. The Lighthouse is maintained by AMSA and has recently been painted. The original optic remains but the light source has been updated. The light still operates at night and is screened from view towards the settled areas to the south west. =Head Lighthouse Keeper's Cottage= The Headkeeper's Quarters designed in 1888 is also constructed in concrete with rendered finish. The building was constructed with two bedrooms, sitting room Inspecting Officer's Room, dining room, kitchens and stores. Most of the building was surrounded by verandah with the corner windbreaks at the north and south eastern corners. The building extends from the north western corner and incorporates store and enclosure forming a courtyard which houses one of the underground water tanks. The building also has verandahs on the northern and southern facades which are connected by a central passage. Another verandah is located on the eastern facade of the building and faces a concrete retaining wall. =Assistant Keeper's Cottages= The Assistants quarters are two semi-detached cottages originally containing four rooms, with kitchen and store areas. The buildings were also constructed of mass concrete cement rendered externally and plastered internally. The roofs originally clad in galvanised iron. The northern residence has the characteristic corner wind break at the north western corner flanked by two open verandahs on the northern and western facades. A verandah located on the eastern facade of the building was enclosed during the 1970s, however the kitchen and store areas continue to enclose the courtyard space to the east of the building. A concrete retaining wall forms the eastern boundary of the courtyard. All of the ceilings were battened during the 1920s through to the 1940s over either the original lath and plaster or later fibrous plaster. The ceilings to the lobby and kitchen appear to be fibre board with timber battens. The northern residence now has three bedrooms, a door opening was made in the dividing party wall between the two residences and partitions erected to facilitate the use of an extra bedroom. The other, southern residence has two bedrooms in addition to kitchen, bathroom and outside toilets. Enclosed balconies provide additional space. The residences generally feature hipped roofs with painted brick chimneys and skillion roof verandahs supported on simply decorated timber posts. A car park and sealed access road were added in the 1970s. =Other structures and elements= Three cement rendered underground water tanks remain the capacity in proportion with each residence. The accompanying pumps however have been removed. A modern steel water tank has been constructed in the courtyard of northern assistant keeper's residence. Paving, fencing, retaining walls and remnant gardens surround the complex. The footings of the flagstaff remain in front of the lighthouse, but the flagstaff has been removed. It was an integral part of the operation of the Lighthouse and can be partly seen in the AMSA brochure on the Lighthouse. Operation and tourism The lighthouse is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and is classified by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). Its nearest lighthouses are South Solitary Island Lighthouse north of Coffs Harbour, to the north, and Tacking Point Lighthouse at Port Macquarie, to the south. The lighthouse complex is located in Hat Head National Park. The head keeper's cottage is now run as a bed and breakfast, and two other cottages as holiday houses, leased from the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service. The cape is a popular point for whale-watching.  Heritage listing  Smoky Cape Lightstation and its setting are highly significant as one of a collection of lighthouses which combine the natural values of a rugged coastal environment with the cultural values of a prominent landmark. Built as an isolated outpost of European settlement it demonstrates the development of coastal shipping in the late 19th century. The light tower retains its original function today using recent technology to allow for automated operation. It is a notable work of NSW Colonial Architect James Barnet which retains components of 19th- century lighthouse technologies. This site retains evidence of cultural values, both Aboriginal and European which demonstrates the changing uses of the site, against a constant of natural values. Smoky Cape Lighthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria: The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Smoky Cape was named by Captain Cook in 1770 for the large number of fires observed along the range. The Lighthouse precinct and Trial Bay Goal together provide a fine example of Colonial architecture and planning and of Colonial government settlement in the area. World War 2 radar installations and ruins show the more recent use of the area for defence purposes. James Barnet designed a series of lighthouse towers in NSW which are reported as being the most architecturally sophisticated in Australia. Smoky Cape retains the distinctive bracketed capital and gunmetal balcony balustrade characteristic to Barnet's design. The pavilion entrance is also a feature reintroduced by Barnet and in evidence at Smoky Cape. The cast iron stair is also a good example of its type. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Smoky Cape is an outstanding and relatively intact example of a late Victorian Lightstation unique in NSW for the use of in-situ mass concrete in the construction of its main buildings. The lighthouse is a fine example constructed in an unusual hexagonal shape with a rare first order Chance Bros. rotating optic. The residences display the robust design typical of Barnet's work, planned to embody the hierarchy of the keepers. Each has a view to the tower. The design is more elaborate than its contemporaries in other States. The natural setting provides a picturesque landscape quality with a sense of isolation accentuated by the siting, with no other man-made elements visible from most of the headland or beaches. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Smoky Range is significant to the Aboriginal populations with a number of mythological associations. In addition, the lightstation and its setting have significance to Europeans as a remote outpost continuously occupied for over 100 years and closely associated with the maritime history of the area. It is a place that attracts many visitors to admire its character, setting and history. It is highly regarded by local and regional populations of the area as one of the oldest and substantially intact building complexes surviving from the Colonial era. The location offers scope for the interpretation of coastal processes in conjunction with cultural values. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Smoky Cape is part of a cohesive group of late 19th- and early 20th-century lightstations in NSW each of which demonstrates the incremental changes in the design and construction of the various complexes. The tower and houses are constructed of mass concrete using aggregate of locally quarried granite and cement rendered both internally and externally. The use of concrete in Australian lighthouses was relatively widespread. In NSW, however, Green Cape and Smoky Cape lighthouses are the only known in-situ concrete towers and both are relatively early uses of concrete. Throughout Australia Smoky Cape is one of approximately 10 in-situ concrete towers constructed prior to 1920. The optic, cast-iron and copper lantern house are examples of the late 19th-century industrial technology. The optic is rare due to its detailed configuration consisting of triple panels which provide the triple group flash. One of numerous 12' diameter Chance lanterns, it is one of only four known to have both a trapezoidal glazing pattern and Trinity type vent. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Early use of mass concrete, together with unusual technology in lantern and lens. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

He was of Telugu origin. Avadhanum Paupiah joined the service of the British East India Company factory at Madras as a clerk and rose to become dubash to the Holland brothers, who served as Governors of Madras. Paupiah and the Hollands were guilty of trying to \\"dispose\\" David Haliburton, an important official and rival of the Hollands. While the Hollands managed to escape to the United Kingdom, Paupiah was convicted and fined. The trial was the subject of a book and the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, a relative of Haliburton, makes a reference to the episode in his book The Surgeon's Daughter.  Early life  Avadhanam Paupiah was born in a family from Nellore, which was then in the princely state of Carnatic. Paupiah had little formal education; however, he was well-versed in his native Telugu. Apart from this, he could also converse in Persian, which was the court language of the princely state and learnt English.  Service with the British East India Company and rise to power  Paupiah joined the service of the British East India Company at an early age. He worked as a \\"writer\\" (clerk who writes or copies documents and papers) in the Sea Customs Department of the British East India Company factory at Madras for sometime and was in charge of keeping the accounts of the Company.  Dubash to the Holland brothers  Soon, Paupiah became the chief dubash to the Holland brothers, John Holland and Edward J. Holland. The Holland brothers were powerful and influential officers in the Madras establishment. As dubash, Paupiah exerted as much influence over the Holland brothers. The Holland brothers were extremely corrupt and when both of them were elected to the assembly, Paupiah assisted them in the unlawful ways by which they made money. John Holland reached the pinnacle of his career in 1789 when he was appointed Governor of Madras. John served as governor from 7 February 1789 to 13 February 1790 and was succeeded by his brother Edward who served just one week. The two brothers amassed a lot of wealth during their terms as governor. During this time, Paupiah became the most influential Indian in the Presidency; even the Nawab of Arcot had to pass through him to approach the governor.  The Haliburton affair  Edward and John Holland found their nemesis in David Haliburton, a member of the Board of Revenue who wished to expose their corrupt practices. Soon, the Hollands grew wary of him and his persistent campaign against them and desired to get rid of him through Paupiah. Paupiah forged evidence against Haliburton and thus brought an end to his period of service in India. However, the scheme was exposed by Lord Cornwallis, the Governor-General of India who unravelled the corrupt practices of the Hollands. The Hollands managed to escape and sail to England, but Paupiah was convicted along with three other Indians. Paupiah was tried between 11 and 13 July 1792 for conspiracy against David Haliburton in the Court of Quarter Sessions presided over by Charles Medows. He was pronounced guilty and sentenced to three years imprisonment and to pay a fine of 2,000 pagodas or one thousand rupees. Avadhanum Paupiah's trial was one of the most famous criminal prosecutions of the time. Paupiah's trial was the subject of a 1793 book of the same name by David Haliburton, which was co-written by the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, who was a close relative of Haliburton.

Stephens wrote Killer Gorilla at the age of 17 after buying a magazine with screenshots of Donkey Kong. He was paid 400 pounds for the game. Stephens wrote two other games for Micro Power: Escape From Moonbase Alpha and Mr EE, a clone of Universal's Mr. Do!. Gameplay Screenshot of the 75m level (BBC Micro) The game involves controlling a man to reach a fair-haired heiress trapped by a large gorilla at the top of the screen. It is made up of four levels, set higher and higher up a construction site ‚Äì 25 m, 50 m, 75 m and 100 m. There are two hammers on the 25 m, 50 m and 100 m levels, with none on the 75 m level. Hammers last for about 10 seconds, as measured by the amount of bonus that ticks away. You cannot climb ladders or jump gaps when holding the hammer. After completing the four levels, the player returns to the 25 m level and the game repeats, getting progressively faster and with more barrels, custard pies, and fireballs. In addition, the girders on the 25 m level acquire more holes. An extra life is awarded when the player completes the 75 m level for the first time. The character is controlled using Z for left, X for right, and return to jump. Scoring * Jumping over barrels or cement pans = 100 points * Hitting barrels or custard pies with hammer = random score between 300 and 900 in increments of 100 points * On the 50 m, 75 m and 100 m levels there are bonus items as follows (these represent the heiress's belongings): ** 50 m....a handbag ( 300 points), a hat (500 points) and an umbrella (800 points) ** 75 m....an umbrella (300 points), a hat (500 points) and a telephone (700 points) ** 100 m....an umbrella (300 points) and a telephone (900 points) * In addition, once a level is completed, the player is awarded a number of points depending on the time remaining on the clock (as indicated by the amount of \\"Bonus\\" shown at the top of the screen). Thus, the quicker a level is completed, the more points the player is awarded. Legacy The game appeared on a number of compilations including 10 Computer Hits (1985), Micropower Magic 2 (1986) and Superior Software's highly regarded Play It Again Sam 3 (1988). PIAS 3 also included a game called Killer Gorilla 2 but this was actually a re-titled early Superior Software game. Based on Donkey Kong Junior and originally released as Zany Kong Junior in 1984, it was soon withdrawn after a cease and desist from Atarisoft, who owned the home computer rights to the original game. Ironically, Atarisoft had commissioned Adrian Stephens to officially port Donkey Kong Junior to the BBC Micro after seeing Killer Gorilla, but the game was never released as Atarisoft decided to abandon the BBC platform.

The featherweight Velox coup√© displayed at the (Scottish) Motor Show painted dark blue below \\"water line\\" and black above had nickel fittings and a polished aluminium bonnet and a walnut instrument panel with companion lockers. The coup√© was upholstered in blue morocco leather with head lining, carpet, silk cords and laces to match. There were also blinds of a lighter blue silk with tassels. These were special body fittings for the cars in the show and not provided within the advertised price.Vauxhall Motors Limited, Stand no. 47, The Scotsman, 8 Nov 1919; pg. 12 =Wensum= There was a mid-twenties fashion for car bodies styled on the lines of motorboats. Described in its advertisementVauxhall display advertisement, The Times, Saturday 24 May 1924; p. xxv; Issue 43660 as \\"an ultra-sporting body\\" a factory-built boat-tailed open two or three-seater with flared wings called the Wensum was introduced at extra cost in 1924.Vauxhall 30‚Äì98, The Times, Thursday 23 Oct 1924; p. 21; Issue 43790 The third seat really was \\"for decoration\\". Works driver, by then works manager, A J Hancock kept a fast motorboat on the River Wensum which has a popular yachting stretch near Norwich. These bodies were not built on the same production line as the Velox. A chassis was available for customers who wanted their own special bodies. Engine =E= The engine was a development of the four- cylinder monobloc fixed cylinder head, push rod operated, L-head side-valve engine of the Prince Henry but enlarged to 4,525 cc by increasing the stroke from 140 to 150 mm. The new crankshaft ran in five bearings with pressure fed lubrication. A single Zenith carburettor was fitted. The engine's power output was at 3,000 rpm. * Production quantity: 274 =OE= In November 1922 it was announced the engine was updated, fitted with overhead valves and detachable cylinder head and renamed OE. The stroke was returned to its original length which gave a slightly smaller capacity of 4,224 cc but power output was up nearly 30% from the original to at 3,300 rpm. Low speed torque was also improved. The car and its wheelbase were lengthened four inches and widened three inches making more room for passengers and more comfortable seating. * Production quantity: 313 Chassis The engine was carried in a separate subframe on the ladder type chassis with semi-elliptic leaf springs, a live rear axle of orthodox design and shock absorbers front and rear. A four-speed gearbox with right hand change was fitted driving the rear wheels through a 3.08:1 straight cut bevel rear axle. For 1923 with the OE engine the straight cut back axle gear was replaced by a spiral bevel with a higher 3.3:1 reduction ratio. The chassis and wheelbase were lengthened four inches and the chassis was also strengthened by widening the cross-section of the side rails. The body was widened three inches.The Times, 9 November 1922 Rear axle torque was now taken through a banjo-shaped torque arm alongside the propellor shaft. =Steering= Steering is by worm and complete wheel with a taper and splined drop-arm connection. =Vauxhall brakes= On 30-98s braking was a mechanical system with the pedal operating a transmission brake. The brakes on the rear wheels were controlled by a large lever (handbrake). Front-wheel brakes became available in late 1923, at first operated by Bowden double-cable but hydraulically from 1926. Brake drums were steel with a riveted cast iron liner. On some cars the drums were finned alloy again with a riveted cast iron liner. The final batch of cars used the 23‚Äì60 components and the front drums were very large, again with fins. The transmission brake‚Äîgiven a slight lead when front brakes were fitted‚Äîin a drum behind the gearbox might have been adequate but it was usually full of oil that had leaked from the rear bearing. Then pressure on the pedal just produced a bad smell. A driver with the necessary skills‚Äîgood hands and an understanding of the effects of the handbrake‚Äîcould corner fast. Handbrake turns were available in wet weather. \\"In an emergency, however, braking was a waste of time, the driver must steer, change gear, jump out or pray‚Äîperhaps in that order.\\" With the OE the three brake drums were switched to steel-lined aluminium drums well ribbed for cooling and linings were ferodo. In 1923 a year after the OE's introduction mechanically operated front brakes were added and linked to the pedal which still operated the transmission brake. In 1927 they were replaced by a notoriously temperamental hydraulic system from the pedal to the transmission and, again, just the front wheels. The hydraulic system introduced in 1927. Back brakes, expanding shoes in enclosed drums, are applied by rods from the hand lever outside the body on the off-side (to the driver's right). Four- wheel brakes actuated by the pedal through a master-plunger operate on the front wheels and on (the back wheels through) the transmission just behind the gearbox. On the front wheels the brakes expand internally within big ribbed enclosed drums and on the transmission the brake contracts. Operation is hydraulic, the transmission brake by having smaller pistons receives only a third of the force. The system is self-adjusting and self-compensating. Equalisation is ensured by the sizes of the plungers. Automatic adjustment is made by the action of a friction ring fitted in a recess in the plunger of the operating system. The front brakes are operated by a quick-thread screw formed by steel balls in grooves. The leading shoe in each wheel is arranged to come on slightly earlier and to release a shade before the other. On the off-side of the dash, under the bonnet, there is a pressurised oil reservoir maintained at about 7 lbs per sq. in. to prevent air getting into the system. A spare half-gallon of the special mixture was part of the equipment. =Suspension= The springs front and back are half elliptical. Behind they are set above the axle with swivel anchorages on the axle sleeves. The forward springs are almost flat-set and they have snubber leaves. There are shock absorbers in front and behind. Road test opinions \\"A power of acceleration, amazingly swift and smooth, yet perfectly controlled ... the thrilling characteristics of a racer in a machine tamed to behave in mannerly fashion ... the engine which gives 100 brake horse power on the bench and which will propel the car at over 80 miles an hour on the level can be throttled down until the vehicle is running smoothly at 12‚Äì15 miles an hour.\\" \\"It is certainly the greediest motor of the touring type that I have driven. I do not mean in petrol but in a straining desire to be allowed to go ever faster.\\"The Vauxhall-Velox, The Times, 14 September 1921; p. 13; Issue 42825 (OE) \\"A rapid double-clutch at 50 or even over can be made without a sound, and away she romps with a slight bark of joy on third ... The price of the 30‚Äì98, so demurely described in the catalogue as a fast touring car, is ¬£1,220\\". Some people feel it is a mistake to compare a 30‚Äì98 with a Bentley. Owner's opinion \\"in spite of my eighteen years experience, I only began to motor in reality since I purchased my 30‚Äì98.\\" Quoted by writer Beverly R Kimes in Automobile Quarterly.

Motor sport By 1920 the 30‚Äì98 had built itself an enduring reputation in racing as well as on the road.The Motor Show. The Times, Friday 12 Nov 1920; p. 7; Issue 42566 Later, with the OE engine, Vauxhall would guarantee that a car stripped down for competition would be able to attain a top speed of 100 mph (160 km/h) After the war 30-98s were never raced by the factory, which had no significant competition department, but they were campaigned successfully by private owners. Rather than following the frequent pre-1914 pattern of ever larger engines for competition results, its success depended less on brute strength (size of engine‚Äîand that was always 4 cylinders) and more on overall excellence of design and sturdiness of construction. Final production run The last cars were made in 1927 and these engines were given a balanced crankshaft allowing them to be tuned to at 3,500 rpm. They also had a closer ratio gearbox.

He is known for controversial works. Life Webster was born at Thornton in Craven in Yorkshire. He claimed education at the University of Cambridge. Although there is no evidence for this, his writing displays a learned style.Nicholas McDowell, The English Radical Imagination: Culture, Religion, and Revolution, 1630-1660 (2003), p. 45. Webster studied under the Hungarian alchemist Johannes Huniades (J√°nos B√°nfi- Hunyadi), who is known to have lectured at Gresham College.Christopher Hill, The World Turned Upside Down (1971), p. 290. Webster became a curate in Kildwick in 1634. He has been linked to Roger Brearley, the Grindletonian leader active at this period in Kildwick (three years earlier);Christopher Hill, The World Turned Upside Down (1971), p. 82. and classified as an Antinomian. During the First English Civil War, Webster left his position as a teacher in Clitheroe and became a surgeon and army chaplain in the Parliamentarian forces. At a later point he was with the forces of Colonel Richard Shuttleworth. In 1648 he became vicar at Mitton.Michael R. Watts, The Dissenters (1978), pp. 180-1. From a Grindeltonian convert, he moved closer to Quaker views.David Farr, John Lambert, Parliamentary Soldier and Cromwellian Major-general, 1619-1684 (2003), p. 174. He has been called a Seeker.Christopher Hill, The World Turned Upside Down (1971), p. 191. Webster preached with William Erbery on 12 October 1653 in a dispute with two London ministers at All Hallows, Lombard Street. Disorder resulted after Erbery took a particularly aggressive line against the established clergy.Woolrych, p. 334.https://biography.wales/article/s-ERBE-WIL-1604 Webster had preached at All Hallows in 1652. In the late 1650s Webster was again in Clitheroe. In 1658 he was arrested and had papers seized.Christopher Hill, The Experience of Defeat (1994), p. 93. He gave up the ministry, and practiced as a physician. He died at ClitheroeAndrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Webster, pp. 867-870. Works on education In The Saints Guide (1653) he rejected the worldly wisdom taught in schools as of no spiritual value. He made the case against any kind of university-educated clergy. Austin Woolrych considers this pamphlet, dated April 1653, was probably a response to the dissolution of the Rump Parliament.Allen G. Debus, The Chemical Philosophy: Paracelsian Science and Medicine in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (2002), p. 394.Austin Woolrych, Commonwealth to Protectorate (2002), note p. 243. The Academiarum Examen of 1654 made detailed proposals for the reform of the university curriculum; it was dedicated to General John Lambert, a highly placed officer of the New Model Army. While arguing as a Baconian, Webster wanted to combine ideas from the experimental philosophy of the time with those of astrology and alchemy. Webster was interested in some of the ideas of Comenius, for example the idea of a \\"real character\\"; he connected this with Egyptian hieroglyphs.Christopher Hill, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution, revisited (1997), note 112 on p. 96 Behind this is the conception of an Adamic language, and the recovery of Adam's knowledge from before the fall.Peter Harrison, 'Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment (2002), p. 150-1. He also advocated for the teaching of the works of Robert Fludd, and others such as Paracelsus. He was satisfied with neither the theological nor the medical training on offer.Christopher Hill, Change and Continuity in 17th Century England (1974), p. 172. When the Royal Society was set up, after the Restoration, Webster welcomed it.Debus, The Chemical Philosophy, pp. 409-410. Authors mentioned in the Academiarum Examen The Examen has 11 chapters, and builds up to the discussion in Chapter X of what in Aristotle‚Äôs teaching should be retained, and how amended. On the way, Webster introduces and marshals many modern authors, and a few scholastic and other medieval names, to illustrate his version of a new curriculum. Excluding classical authors and Church Fathers, at first appearance they comprise the following: *Chapter I: Hugh of St Victor *Chapter II: Descartes, Nicholas of Cusa, Francis Bacon *Chapter III: John Dee, Comenius, Joseph Webbe, John Brinsley, William Oughtred, Harrigon, Trithemius, Giambattista Porta, Cornelius Agrippa, Claramuel, Gustavus Silenus, Roger Bacon, Kenelm Digby, Jakob B√∂hme *Chapter IV: Pierre Gassendi, Justus Lipsius, Johann Baptist van Helmont, Nicholas Hill, Ramon Llull, Paulus Schalichius, Ficino *Chapter V: John Napier, Henry Briggs, Galileo, Christoph Scheiner, Aguillonius, Hevelius, Thomas White, Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, Kepler, Nathanael Carpenter, Pico della Mirandola, Elias Ashmole, William Lilly, John Booker, Sanders, Nicholas Culpepper, Ubaldus, Marcus Marci, Baptista Benedictus *Chapter VI: Abenrois, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Albertus Magnus, Gregorius, Durandus, Harvaeus, Maronaeus, Alliacensis, Trismegistus, Geber, Arnoldus de Villa Nova, Basilius Valentinus, Johann Isaac Hollandus,Hollandus was a fictional alchemist. Paracelsus, William Harvey, Robert Fludd, Crollius, Quercetan (Joseph Duchesne), William Gilbert, Mark Ridley, William Barlow, Cabaeus, Athanasius Kircher, Magnenus Regius (Johann Chrysostom Magnenus), Phocyllides Holwarda *Chapter VII: Thomas Campanella, Lambertus Danaeus (Lambert Daneau), Jean Bodin, Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes *Chapter VIII: Erasmus, Luther, Ramus *Chapter IX: Bullialdus *Chapter X: Franciscus Patritius, Telesius, Melanchthon According to Frances Yates: Controversy over the Academiarum Examen A reply from the Oxford academics Seth Ward and John Wilkins, in Vindiciae Academiarum (1654) was used by them as an opportunity to defend a more moderate programme of updating, partly put in place already. Ward and Wilkins put the case that Webster was ignorant of recent changes, and inconsistent in championing both Bacon and Fludd, whose methods were incompatible. Wilkins suggested Webster might be well matched with Alexander Ross: Ross was a most conservative supporter of Aristotle, who with Galen was Webster's main target in the classical authorities, and Wilkins had defended the Copernican system against Ross in a long controversy running from the late 1630s to the mid-1640s.Adrian Johns, Prudence and Pedantry in Early Modern Cosmology: The Trade of Al Ross, History of Science 35 (1997), 23-59. Ward and Wilkins used the same publication to argue against others (William Dell and Thomas Hobbes) who had been attacking the old universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Other opponents of the Examen were Thomas Hall and George Wither.Allen G. Debus, Science and Education in the Seventeenth Century: The Webster-Ward Debate (1970).Nigel Smith, Literature and Revolution in England, 1640‚Äì1660 (1994), p. 198. The long-running Hobbes-Wallis controversy was a by-product of this debate. It has also been taken as symptomatic of a developing split separating on academic issues the circle of Samuel Hartlib, close in views and sympathies to Webster, from those in the universities who in religious terms would be allies, on the issues of practical applications, and also the status of astrology, chemistry after Paracelsus and van Helmont, and pansophism.David C. Lindberg, Ronald L. Numbers, God and Nature: Historical Essays on the Encounter Between Christianity and Science (1986), p. 211. Other works He edited William Erbery's works and wrote his biography in 1658, as The Testimony of William Erbery.Christopher Hill, A Nation of Change and Novelty (1993), p. 189. Metallographia (1671) was a chemical work. It attributed to minerals the property of growth. He had a corpuscle theory of matter, described as intermediate between those of Kenelm Digby and Herman Boerhaave.Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs, The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy: Or \\"The Hunting of the Greene Lyon\\" (1983), p. 81. It also drew on the work of Robert Boyle; but the strong influence was that of Jan Baptist van HelmontBruce T. Moran, Distilling Knowledge: Alchemy, Chemistry, and the Scientific Revolution (2005), p. 141.Joseph Stewart Fruton, Methods and Styles in the Development of Chemistry (2002), p. 14.; this book was one that Isaac Newton used in his own alchemical work. Daniel Georg Morhof criticised it as largely a compilation from German authors (Boyle was not mentioned); the views of Johann Pharamund Rhumelius were given at length.Lynn Thorndike, History of Magic and Experimental Science vol. 12 (1923), pp. 263-4. His The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft (1677) was a critical and sceptical review of evidence for witchcraft. According to Hugh Trevor-Roper, this is not an innovative work, but at the level of that of Johann Weyer.Hugh Trevor-Roper. Religion, the Reformation and Social Change (1967), pp. 168-9. He opposed Henry More and Joseph Glanvill, who were arguing for the reality of witches.http://www.bede.org.uk/decline.htm Webster went as far as suggesting that the Bible had been mistranslated to support that belief.Christopher Hill, The English Bible and the Seventeenth-Century Revolution (1993), p. 402. It was translated into German, being published in 1719 at Halle where Christian Thomasius had made his scepticism an academic point of view.Ian Bostridge, Witchcraft and Its Transformations, c.1650-c.1750 (1997), p. 235. In the same year he defended the reputation of John Dee against Meric Casaubon. He had recommended Dee in the Examen, and was a proponent of natural magic.Peter J. French (1972), John Dee: The World of an Elizabethan Magus pp. 12-3 and pp. 175-6.

The shipwreck was close to the place where the Portuguese ship, S√£o Jo√£o, had gone down more than two centuries earlier on 8 June 1552. The Grosvenor was a three-masted ship of 729 tons on her return voyage to England when she was wrecked, carrying a crew of 132 and 18 passengers (12 adults and 6 children), and a cargo valued at ¬£75,000. Of the 123 survivors, only 18 reached Cape Town and were repatriated, the remainder dying of their privations or joining with, Bantu tribes.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa Four survivors, Robert Price, Thomas Lewis, John Warmington, and Barney Larey, eventually got back to England. History Robert Smirke The Grosvenor had left Madras in March 1782 under the command of Captain John Coxon, falling in with Admiral Hughes' fleet. On 13 June 1782, she set sail for England from Trincomalee in Ceylon. Sailing west near the Cape coast at 1 am and while adjusting the sails to ride out a gale, the crew noticed lights to the west, but dismissed them as something akin to the northern lights. When the lights presently disappeared, they were given no further thought. As it turned out, the lights were grassfires burning on a headland directly on their course, and their disappearance was due to their being hidden by the brow of the hill. At 4 am, Thomas Lewis reported that he thought he could see land, but the idea was rejected by the commanding officer of the watch, Thomas Beale, as everyone on board was certain that they were at least out to sea. The quartermaster Mixon, after some hesitation, alerted the captain, who instantly came on deck. He attempted to club haul the ship, but this failed, and the vessel ran aground on the rocks. In the darkness, the crew firmly believed that as they were a long way from land, they had struck an uncharted island or reef. With a change in the wind direction, the captain felt that they could refloat the Grosvenor and run her aground in some more convenient place. A fortuitous change in the wind allowed the stern section of the ship, where most of the passengers were trapped, to be hauled into a sheltered inlet. Seventeen of the passengers and ninety-one of the crew survived the initial disaster. Captain Coxon, together with the Second Mate, William Shaw, and Third Mate, Thomas Beale, mustered the passengers and crew on the shore, retrieving what supplies they could from the wreckage of the ship (the First Mate, Alexander Logie, was suffering from dysentery). According to Shaw's apprentice, William HabberleyW. Habberley 1786 \\"An Appendix to Mr Dalrymple's Account of the Loss of the Grosvenor Indiaman,\\" in A. Dalrymple 1786, \\"An Account of the Loss of the Grosvenor Indiaman.\\" London,J. Sewell & J.Debrett. (one of the ultimate survivors of the disaster), Pondo tribesmen soon arrived on the scene, but offered no assistance, being more concerned to recover nails and other iron from the wreck. Coxon and his officers knew that they were a considerable distance from the nearest European settlements, the Dutch Cape Colony to the south and Portuguese colony of Delagoa Bay to the north. In the first few days ashore, there was evidently some further interaction with the Pondo, one of whom apparently pointed to the north-east. One of the seamen, Joshua Glover, walked away with the Pondo (Habberley claimed he was \\"disturbed in his mind,\\" but he and another of the seamen, John Bryan, were among the few ultimate survivors, later found to be living happily among the Pondo). Coxon decided to press south towards the Cape, insisting that they could reach it on foot within ten to seventeen days. This was a serious miscalculation, because the distance to the Cape was 400 miles, rather than the 250 that he believed (Delagoa Bay was closer). Neither the captain nor his passengers were able to complete their journey. They made camp a few days after they had set out, and most of them died of starvation. A few of the fitter men continued, receiving assistance at several native kraals, and eighteen, including Habberley, eventually made their way to the Cape. Dalrymple's official report to the East India Company concluded that the loss of so many lives had been caused principally by \\"want of management with the natives,\\" noting that \\"the individuals that fell singly among them\\" (Joshua Glover and John Bryan) had been treated \\"rather with kindness than with brutality.\\" There were rumours that some of the women passengers might have survived in a similar way. Although no conclusive evidence for this was ever found, there was certainly circumstantial evidence. Eight years after the wreck, a rescue mission, consisting of Boer farmers, set off to find survivors, as there had been persistent rumours that several women had survived and were living among the natives. This mission found three white women at a native settlement near the Umgazana River.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3612346/A-history-of- the-Grosvenor-shipwreck.html. Review, 16 Feb 2004. Retrieved 3 February 2016. The author Stephen Taylor has argued that two of these were survivors from the Grosvenor.Taylor, Stephen (2004), Caliban's Shore: The Wreck of the Grosvenor and the Strange Fate of Her Survivors Port Grosvenor and Sidney Turner The first attempt at salvage was reported on 20 May 1880 by the paper Natal Mercury, in an article stating that Captain Sidney Turner and a friend, Lieut Beddoes, of the Durban Volunteer Artillery, had set off for Port St Johns in the vessel Adonis, had proceeded to the wreck and commenced blasting the rocks with dynamite, retrieving Indian coins and Venetian ducats as well as several ship's cannon, two of which were later displayed at the Local History Museum in Durban. In 1867, Turner and his brother-in-law, Walter Compton, had bought of undeveloped Crown land on the Natal South Coast between Umkomaas and the present village of Clansthal, and called the property Ellingham. In 1881, from the profits of his salvage, Turner floated a company and commissioned the construction of a small coastal steamer, the Lady Wood, built in Greenwich. Another investor was George Hall Rennie, son of shipping magnate John T. Rennie, who came into possession of one of the Grosvenors cannon. Turner also had a local silversmith produce a goblet from recovered silver rupees, an item which also found its way to the Local History Museum. By the beginning of 1885, a local chief Mqikela, who had become disaffected with the British government and wanted to develop his own harbour, concluded an agreement with Turner, in which Turner was granted 20,000 acres of land, including the coastline on which the Grosvenor had foundered. In return for this, Turner was to select a suitable site for a harbour and undertake the necessary construction work. The site chosen for this new venture was at the mouth of the Mkweni River, close to the site of the Grosvenor wreck. Turner named it Port Grosvenor. As Port Captain and harbourmaster, Turner collected customs dues and managed the harbour and pilotage. Turner was obliged by his financial circumstances to resign himself to this situation as he, by 1884, had a family of seven children and a wife to support. Despite objections from the Cape Government the port was officially opened. The Cape Government later declared Turner's concession illegal under tribal law, and he forfeited the land, his home and his position. The family moved to Port St Johns and Port Grosvenor faded into obscurity, the last ship calling there in January 1886 being the London-built coaster SS Somtseu, named for Theophilus Shepstone.

He was born in Vienna and died in Ronsberg, Western Bohemia (today Pobƒõ≈æovice in the Czech Republic). He spoke 18 languages (including Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew and Japanese), and his diplomatic postings included Athens, Rio de Janeiro, Constantinople and Buenos Aires. He was made Deputy Minister of Austria-Hungary to Japan, where he remained for 4 years, studying Buddhism and marrying a young Japanese woman from a Samurai family, Mitsuko Aoyama. They had seven children, including Richard von Coudenhove- Kalergi, best known for his role in establishing the Pan-European Movement.  Views on race and religion  In his youth, Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi had been an antisemite. He had expected to confirm his antipathy towards the Jews when he started work on his treatise, Das Wesen des Antisemitismus (The Essence of Antisemitism). But he came to a different conclusion by the time he published his book in 1901. Following an ironic critique of the new racial theories, he declared that the essence of antisemitism amounted to nothing more credible than fanatical religious hatred. He traced that fanaticism to religious bigotry that originated in the promulgation of Torah under Ezra. According to Coudenhove-Kalergi, Jewish religious bigotry provoked opposition from the relatively tolerant Greco-Roman polytheists, eliciting their anti- Judaic reaction. Antisemitism came into existence when Christianity and Islam took over the intolerant fanaticism of Judaism, and turned it against the Jews. Thus, Heinrich Coudenhove-Kalergi credited the Jews with originating religious intolerance, and condemned it as a violation of genuine religious principles. He branded every sort of anti-Judaism unchristian. He further urged liberal Christians and Jews to ally in protecting both of their religions, and religion as such, against the emerging menace of secularism. In spite of his opposition to simplistic racial theory, Coudenhove-Kalergi agreed that Jews are racially distinct. Although he pointed out that there is no Semitic race, because Semitic is a language family; he equivocated by also remarking that the charges that Semites were uncreative were belied by civilizations formed by the Assyrians and Babylonians, who spoke Semitic languages. He further sought to defend the Jews against bigoted charges of parasitic greed and cowardice with anecdotal counterexamples of Jewish industriousness and martial courage.

Stickies have the potential to contaminate the components either within or around the equipment necessary in the Stages of Manufacturing that a Paper Mill follows in its Developed Process, but would have otherwise excluded it in its routine cleaning and maintenance procedures. Contaminations of paper that are classified as tacky are also called stickies. The main sources for stickies are recycled paper, waxes, and soft adhesives. Composition Stickies are an indefinite mixture of organic compounds, with the main part being different esters. The components might stem from: *Printing inks *Coating binders (synthetic latex) *Waxes *Hot melt adhesive and unsupported pressure-sensitive adhesives *Plastics *Wet strength resins *Pitch *Papermaking additives Properties Stickies that pass through a slotted plate screen of 0.10 - 0.15 mm are called micro stickies. Micro stickies can be finely dispersed (100 ¬µm - 100 nm), colloidal (100 - 10 nm) or molecularly dissolved (< 10 nm). Macro stickies are those which are retained as screening residue. The reason for this classification is that macro stickies are easy to remove from the deinked pulp during the deinking process by means of filtration. Micro stickies are transported with the pulp to the paper machine and might agglomerate and cause problematic deposits there. Stickies often have thermoplastic properties. Chemical-physical alterations like pH, temperature and charge changes might cause colloidal destabilization and agglomeration of micro stickies. Stickies control Several control methods are used: *Alteration of the physical properties, like using recycling-friendly paper coatings *Avoidance of troublesome components that cause stickies *Removal by more effective deinking processes, like improved screening, cleaning, washing and flotation *Passivation with process additives like fixation agents *Prevention by washing wires or protecting equipment parts with chemicals. *Measuring stickies using TAPPI method T274 and T277 References Category:Papermaking Category:Paper recycling ","title":"Stickies (papermaking)"},{"id":"21520419","text":"G≈Çƒôbocko () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Grodk√≥w, within Brzeg County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

It was first released in the United States on June 25, 2008 through Cellar Door Publishing. In 2009 Minister Jade was selected as one of YALSA's \\"Great Graphic Novels for Teens\\" for that year. Synopsis In Yuan Dynasty China a down-on-his-luck former government official named Zhen Wenxiu tries to commit suicide by jumping into the stormy sea, but is instead carried off to the mysterious Island of Living Jade. There he is met by two green-skinned dwarves who question him as to the state of their former home, China. When Wenxiu informs them that it has been conquered by the Mongols and transformed into a land of oppression and injustice, the dwarves give him a magical belt of Living Jade and encourage him to use its power to free China from the Mongol yoke. But the prestige-hungry Wenxiu chooses to serve rather than destroy the occupying regime. He insinuates himself into the retinue of Mongol emperor Khubilai Khan and basks in the wealth and status of his new position. Meanwhile, a mad cult leader named Wanyao Wang is on a mission to destroy all of China with a dread mist that turns people into solid gold. Wenxiu eventually uncovers this plot and wants to act, but Khubilai Khan urges him to focus his attention instead on the impending invasion of Japan. Realizing that Khubilai cares more about his imperial ambitions than the people of China, Wenxiu finally breaks away from him and sets out to stop Wanyayo Wang. In the end he gives up the life of a high-ranking minister for that of a poor but honorable hero. Reception Comics Bulletin gave a mixed review for Minister Jade, writing that it was \\"a far-from-perfect book, but it is an interesting study of a hero‚Äôs journey set against a different set of cultural values.\\" The School Library Journal was more positive, stating \\"Full of humor, action, and art strongly influenced by traditional Chinese design, it‚Äôs a vivid origin story.\\" References Category:2008 graphic novels Category:American graphic novels Category:Young adult fantasy novels ","title":"Minister Jade"},{"id":"21520491","text":"B≈Ça≈ºejowice () is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Lewin Brzeski, within Brzeg County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

Original Bolin instruments are now rare and valuable.Georg Bolin's 11-string alto guitar for sale by Kurosawa Gakki The Bolin alto guitar most often has eleven strings, but Bolin also made a thirteen-string version. The 11-string alto guitar is a multi-string classical guitar, which generally refers to classical guitars with more than six strings. Classical guitars with extra strings can have from seven to 13 or more strings.16-string guitar by Philip Woodfield Moore However, an 11-string is the most useful for performing lute music, particularly Bach and Weiss. The first six strings are tuned in the same intervals as the normal classic guitar. Therefore, a musician can play with conventional fingering on those strings. In the United States, luthier Walter Stanul makes performance instruments ranging from 11 to 13-strings called the Archguitar. The design and the body shape of this guitar is similar to the vihuela, and thus it is fundamentally different from the Bolin design.Archguitar shape by Archguitar.com History Georg Bolin first constructed 11-string alto guitar with collaboration with Swedish guitarist Per-Olof Johnson in 1960s. Johnson is the teacher of a well-known guitarist G√∂ran S√∂llscher who made this instrument famous through his extensive usage of Bolin's 11-string alto guitar.G√∂ran S√∂llscher's profile by allmusic.comG√∂ran S√∂llscher's discography by Deutche Grammophon Johnson was fond of lute music, but the difference in playing techniques between guitar and lute is significant, and he was looking for a way to play lute music using guitar playing technique. Thus, the design goal was specifically to be able to play renaissance lute music directly from original tabs using guitar playing technique. This design introduced two main elements. The first was to provide conventional lute tuning by tuning the first six strings a minor third higher (hence the name \\"alto guitar\\"). It is equivalent to putting a capo on the third fret of the normal prime guitar. The second element was to add five extra strings to accommodate low notes. Tuning The typical 11-string alto guitar tuning is (from low to high strings): Bb1 C2 D2 Eb2 F2 G2 C3 F3 Bb3 D4 G4.11-string alto guitar tuning by altoguitars.com Makers Current luthiers who build 11-string alto guitars, primarily located in Sweden, include Heikki Rousu and Roger Str√∂mberg. Ermanno Chiavi in Switzerland is known for his 13-string guitar built for Anders Miolin, but he builds 11-string guitars as well.11-string guitar by Ermanno Chiavi Chiavi's guitar has the scale length of a normal classical guitar, 650mm, and is tuned in the same manner as classical guitar. Therefore, it is technically not an \\"alto\\" guitar. Yoshimitsu Hoshino in Japan built 11-string alto guitars with the same specification with Bolin's design in 1980s.

Early life and Second World War David James Wood was born in Corsham, Wiltshire, and educated at Monkton Combe School. He was commissioned to the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry and joined the 2nd (airlanding) Battalion (the 52nd) in 1942. The battalion formed part of 6th Airlanding Brigade, 6th Airborne Division in 1943. Pegasus Bridge Wood was a D Company platoon commander in the coup de main operation on D Day led by Major John Howard. The objective was to seize Benouville Bridge, now known as Pegasus Bridge, over the Caen canal and Ranville Bridge, now known as Horsa Bridge, over the River Orne. The original plan was for Wood to lead the first platoon across the bridge at Benouville; however, shortly before D Day, Howard changed the order of landing and Lieutenant Den Brotheridge was selected to lead the first platoon across Pegasus Bridge. On D Day, Wood and his No 24 platoon were in the second glider to land at Pegasus Bridge, touching down at 00.17 hours, one minute after the first glider. Wood's platoon's objective was to clear trenches, machine-gun nests and the anti-tank gun pit along the east bank of Pegasus Bridge. By 00.26 hours on D Day both bridges had been secured. Along with his 'Batman (military)' Pvt Albert Chatfield he was shot in the leg by a burst from a Machine Pistol whilst leading his platoon. He was evacuated to a divisional aid post in Ranville and eventually back to England. The capture of the bridges was portrayed in the film The Longest Day (1962). Post World War II Following the Second World War, Wood served in Greece, the Suez Canal Zone, BAOR, Cyprus, Malaya, Northern Ireland, and Aden. Wood was second-in- command of the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) in Penang, during the insurgency in Brunei and the Confrontation with Indonesia. He was mentioned in despatches in Brunei, 1962. He was Military Assistant to the C-in-C British Army of the Rhine and was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry became the 1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd) on 7 November 1958 and the 1st Battalion The Royal Green Jackets on 1 January 1966. Wood retired from the Army in 1978. Later life Wood became President of the Exeter branch of the Normandy Veterans' Association. In June 2004, at the 60th anniversary of the Normandy landings, he was awarded the French Legion d' honneur, the highest order of France. He lived in Cullompton, Devon. He married Alice Bindloss in 1969, a former officer of the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps.

Early life Not much is known of Marino's early life. He was born in Valle del Cauca and studied at an official college. Early career as a revolutionary Ospina was convinced that the revolution in Colombia had to become violent to be successful. He then fought with the guerrillas in Venezuela. In 1970 he returned to Colombia to establish M-19 along with Jaime Bateman Cay√≥n, a friend from the group Communist Youth (Juventudes Comunistas, JUCO), who had recently been expelled from the FARC. Ospina became the second in command of M-19. A few days after this promotion, Ospina was arrested in Cali and sent to Bogot√° where he was tortured in the notorious \\"Sacromonte caves\\" to the point that he made a suicide attempt. Six months later Ospina, disguised as a major of the Army, escaped and resumed the role of second in command. Leader of M-19 Bateman died on April 28, 1983 in a plane crash, and Ospina inherited the leadership of the guerrilla group. As such, he was in Madrid for the controversial meetings with President Belisario Betancur which would lead to a truce agreement in 1984. In December of that year, at a reunion in Mexico, Ospina made what would be a monumental faux pas: he applauded mafia threats to Americans living in Colombia. This tactical error cost him the leadership of M-19. He was replaced by √Ålvaro Fayad. His position, always on the side of the \\"hard\\", earned him the nickname \\"Ivan el terrible.\\" Death Ospina died in a military operation against the guerrilla group by the army in August 1985 in the city of Cali. According to the official version, intelligence forces involved in the operation found a house in which was the commander of M-19. The house was besieged on the morning of August 28 and after an hour of combat, Ivan Marino Ospina, who until a few months earlier had been the chief of M-19, was killed, along with his bodyguard, Gerardo Ospina. His son Jorge Iv√°n Ospina, future mayor of Cali, was injured in the operation, as was Antonio Navarro Wolff, future governor of the Department of Nari√±o. On November 6th, 1985, a group of M-19 guerrillas named themselves the \\"Ivan Marino Ospina Company\\" after the recently deceased commander and commenced an attack on the Colombian Palace of Justice.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1985/11/13/27-hours- that-shook-bogota/df179624-949a-4a89-8252-ad4ceae28c6f/ Portrayal on television The character of Ivan Torres in the television series Narcos is based on Ospina.

This view is maintained by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox communion, the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East. Each of them maintains that their own specific institutional church (denomination) exclusively represents the one and only original church. The claim to the title of the \\"one true church\\" relates to the first of the Four Marks of the Church mentioned in the Nicene Creed: \\"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church\\". As such, it also relates to claims of both catholicity and apostolic succession: asserting inheritance of the spiritual, ecclesiastical and sacramental authority and responsibility that Jesus Christ gave to the apostles. The concept of schism somewhat moderates the competing claims between some churches ‚Äì one can potentially repair schism, since they are striving for the same goal. For example, the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches each regard the other as schismatic and at very least heterodox, if not heretical.At least the Catholic position on the matter is clear: the Orthodox reject Papal infallibility, deny the Filioque and the power of Indulgences, among other doctrines. But with the Orthodox there is less clarity. Many Orthodox object to the Catholic doctrines of Purgatory, substitutionary atonement, the Immaculate Conception, and papal supremacy, among others, as heretical doctrines. See Vatican Insider, \\"Two Orthodox bishops accuse the Pope of heresy\\" 04-15-14 Many mainstream Anglicans and Protestants regard all baptized Christians as members of a spiritual‚Äî not institutional‚Äî \\"Christian Church\\" regardless of their differing beliefs; this belief is sometimes referred to by the theological term \\"invisible church\\". Some Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship espouse a version of branch theory which teaches that the true Christian Church comprises Anglican, Eastern Orthodox, Old Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Scandinavian Lutheran, and Roman Catholic branches. Other denominations, such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also claim inheritance of the authority and responsibility that Jesus Christ conferred on the apostles. Other groups, such as Iglesia ni Cristo, believe in a last-messenger doctrine, where no such succession takes place. Restorationism believes they have restored the original church in belief or in practice. The Seventh-day Adventist Church regards itself to be the one true church in the sense of being a faithful remnant. Teachings by denomination Catholicism Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting St. Peter's Basilica in Rome sitting \\"Upon this rock,\\" a reference to Matthew 16:18 The Catholic Church teaches that Christ set up only \\"one true Church\\", and that this Church of Christ is and subsists only in the Catholic Church.https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa- quaestiones_en.html, B) [In Caput I in genere: Act Syn III/II 297-301] From this follows that it regards itself as \\"the universal sacrament of salvation for the human race\\" and the only true religion. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Catholic ecclesiology professes the Catholic Church to be the \\"sole Church of Christ\\" - i.e., the one true church defined as \\"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic\\" in the Four Marks of the Church in the Nicene Creed. The Council of Nicea (AD 325) originally formulated this teaching and ratified the Apostle's Creed (the basis for the Nicene Creed). The church teaches that only the Catholic Church was founded by Jesus Christ, who appointed the Twelve Apostles to continue his work as the Church's earliest bishops.Kreeft, p. 98, quote \\"The fundamental reason for being a Catholic is the historical fact that the Catholic Church was founded by Christ, was God's invention, not man's ... As the Father gave authority to Christ (Jn 5:22; Mt 28:18‚Äì20), Christ passed it on to his apostles (Lk 10:16), and they passed it on to the successors they appointed as bishops.\\" Catholic belief holds that the Church \\"is the continuing presence of Jesus on earth\\",Schreck, p. 131 and that all duly- consecrated bishops have a lineal succession from the apostles.Barry, p. 46 In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the Pope), is considered the successor to the apostle Simon Peter, from whom the Pope derives his supremacy over the Church.CCC, 880. Accessed Aug 20, 2011 The 1943 papal encyclical Mystici corporis Christi further describes the Church as the Mystical Body of Christ.Pius XII, Encyclical Mystici corporis Christi, Vatican City, 1943. Accessed Aug 20, 2011 Thus the Catholic Church holds that \\"the one Church of Christ which in the Creed is professed as one, holy, catholic and apostolic ... This Church constituted and organized in the world as a society, subsists in the Catholic Church, which is governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with him.\\"Second Vatican Council, Lumen gentium, 8 In responding to some questions regarding the doctrine of the Church concerning itself, the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, \\"Clarius dicendum esset veram Ecclesiam esse solam Ecclesiam catholicam romanam...\\" (\\"It should be said more clearly that the Roman Catholic Church alone is the true Church..\\")https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa- quaestiones_en.html, C) [In Caput I in genere: Act Syn III/II 296s] And it also clarified that the term subsistit in used in reference to the Church in the Second Vatican Council's 1964 decree Lumen gentium \\"indicates the full identity of the Church of Christ with the Catholic Church\\". The 1215 Fourth Lateran Council declared that: \\"There is one universal Church of the faithful, outside of which there is absolutely no salvation\\", a statement of what is known as the doctrine of extra Ecclesiam nulla salus. In the encyclical Mortalium animos of 6 January 1928, Pope Pius XI wrote that \\"in this one Church of Christ no man can be or remain who does not accept, recognize and obey the authority and supremacy of Peter and his legitimate successors\\" and quoted the statement of Lactantius: \\"The Catholic Church is alone in keeping the true worship. This is the fount of truth, this the house of Faith, this the temple of God: if any man enter not here, or if any man go forth from it, he is a stranger to the hope of life and salvation.\\" Accordingly, the Second Vatican Council of 1962-1965 declared: \\"Whosoever, [...] knowing that the Catholic Church was made necessary by Christ, would refuse to enter or to remain in it, could not be saved. In the same document, the Council continued: \\"The Church recognizes that in many ways she is linked with those who, being baptized, are honored with the name of Christian, though they do not profess the faith in its entirety or do not preserve unity of communion with the successor of Peter.\\"Lumen gentium, 15 And in a decree on ecumenism, Unitatis redintegratio, it stated: \\"Catholics must gladly acknowledge and esteem the truly Christian endowments from our common heritage which are to be found among our separated brethren. It is right and salutary to recognise the riches of Christ and virtuous works in the lives of others who are bearing witness to Christ, sometimes even to the shedding of their blood. For God is always wonderful in His works and worthy of all praise.\\" The Catholic Church teaches that the fullness of the \\"means of salvation\\" exists only in the Catholic Church, but the church acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of ecclesial communities separated from itself to \\"impel towards Catholic unity\\" and thus bring people to salvation in the Catholic Church ultimately. It teaches that anyone who is saved is saved through the Catholic Church but that people can be saved ex voto and by pre-baptismal martyrdom as well as when conditions of invincible ignorance are present, although invincible ignorance in itself is not a means of salvation. Roman Catholic theology regards formal schismatics as outside the church, understanding by \\"formal schismatics\\" \\"persons who, knowing the true nature of the Church, have personally and deliberately committed the sin of schism\\". Aidan Nichols, Rome and the Eastern Churches (Liturgical Press 1992), p. 41 The situation, for instance, of those who have been brought up from childhood within a group not in full communion with Rome, but who have orthodox faith, differs: Catholics consider such persons imperfectly, though not fully, members of the Church. This nuanced view applies especially to the churches of Eastern Christianity, more particularly still to the Eastern Orthodox Church. Eastern Orthodoxy The Eastern Orthodox Church has identified itself as the \\"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church\\" in, for instance, synods held in 1836 and 1838 and in its correspondence with Pope Pius IX and Pope Leo XIII.Erwin Fahlbusch, William Bromiley (editors), The Encyclopedia of Christianity (Eerdmans 2003) vol.3, p. 867 Some Orthodox hold that there can be a kind of imperfect participation in the Church by those not visibly in communion with it. Lutheranism thumb...one holy Church is to continue forever. The Church is the congregation of saints, in which the Gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered. ‚ÄìAugsburg ConfessionSee [http://www.bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article7 Augsburg Confession, Article 7, Of the Church] The Augsburg Confession found within the Book of Concord, a compendium of belief of the Lutheran Churches, teaches that \\"the faith as confessed by Luther and his followers is nothing new, but the true Catholic faith, and that their churches represent the true catholic or universal church\\". When the Lutherans presented the Augsburg Confession to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530, they believe to have \\"showed that each article of faith and practice was true first of all to Holy Scripture, and then also to the teaching of the church fathers and the councils\\". Lutheran theology therefore holds that: Laestadian Lutherans, in particular, emphasize this belief. Baptists Graph from The Trail of Blood, a popular Baptist book that teaches the doctrine of Baptist successionism. Many Baptists, who uphold the doctrine of Baptist successionism (also known as Landmarkism), \\"argue that their history can be traced across the centuries to New Testament times\\" and \\"claim that Baptists have represented the true church\\" that \\"has been, present in every period of history\\". These Baptists maintain that those who held their views throughout history, including the \\"Montanists, Novatians, Patarenes, Bogomils, Paulicians, Arnoldists, Henricians, Albigenses, and Waldenses\\", were persecuted for their faith, a belief that these Baptists maintain to be \\"grand distinguishing mark of the true church\\". In the introduction of The Trail of Blood, a Baptist text that explicates the doctrine of Baptist succession, Clarence Walker states that \\"The history of Baptists, he discovered, was written in blood. They were the hated people of the Dark Ages. Their preachers and people were put into prison and untold numbers were put to death.\\" J. M. Carroll, the author of the said text The Trail of Blood, also appeals to historian Johann Lorenz von Mosheim, who stated \\"Before the rise of Luther and Calvin, there lay secreted in almost all the countries of Europe persons who adhered tenaciously to the principles of modern Dutch Baptists.\\" Walter B. Shurden, the founding executive director of the Center for Baptist Studies at Mercer University, writes that the theology of Landmarkism, which he states is integral of the history of the Southern Baptist Convention, upholds the ideas that \\"Only Baptist churches can trace their lineage in uninterrupted fashion back to the New Testament, and only Baptist churches therefore are true churches.\\" In addition Shurden writes that Baptists who uphold successionism believe that \\"only a true church-that is, a Baptist church-can legitimately celebrate the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's Supper. Any celebration of these ordinances by non-Baptists is invalid.\\" Baptists who uphold this ecclesiology also do not characterize themselves as being a Protestant church due to their belief that \\"they did not descend from those churches that broke away in protest from the church of Rome. Rather, they had enjoyed a continuous historical existence from the time of the very first church in the New Testament days.\\" These views are generally no longer widely held in the Southern Baptist Convention although they are still taught by some Southern Baptist Churches and many independent Baptist churches, Primitive Baptists, and some \\"congregations affiliated with the American Baptist Association.\\" Anabaptists An Amish family in Lyndonville, New York. =Amish= The Amish, as with other Anabaptist Christians, believe that \\"the established church became corrupt, ineffectual, and displeasing to God.\\" The Amish believe that the true church is pure and separate from the world: =Holdeman Mennonites= The Holdeman Mennonites teach that their Church of God in Christ is the one true church. Anabaptist theologian Donald Kraybill writes: =Other Anabaptist organizations= Some small epsicopal church groups, such as the \\"Workers and Friends\\", represent themselves as nondenominational and hold all other churches to be false. Quakers As described in the tract The Glory of the True Church by Francis Howgill, the Religious Society of Friends traditionally believed that after the Apostolic Era, the \\"true Church fled into the wilderness\\" and \\"the false Church came into visibility\\". George Fox and his followers \\"believed that they were called to carry out the true reformation, to restore apostolic Christianity, and to make a fresh beginning\\". As such, \\"The Quaker community was the one true Church, and consequently those converted by Quaker preaching were expected to join it.\\" Among some Quakers, there became a \\"shift from being the one and only True Church to being a part of the True Church\\" and so \\"marriage with non-Quakers became accepted by many in the Quaker community\\", though \\"they still had to marry within the Meeting House, as well as gain approbation.\\" Methodism new birth and entire sanctification to the public at events such as tent revivals and camp meetings, which they believe is the reason that God raised them up into existence. Methodists affirm belief in \\"the one true Church, Apostolic and Universal\\", viewing their Churches as constituting a \\"privileged branch of this true church\\". With regard to the position of Methodism within Christendom, the founder of the movement \\"John Wesley once noted that what God had achieved in the development of Methodism was no mere human endeavor but the work of God. As such it would be preserved by God so long as history remained.\\" Calling it \\"the grand depositum\\" of the Methodist faith, Wesley specifically taught that the propagation of the doctrine of entire sanctification was the reason that God raised up the Methodists in the world. Restorationism A stained glass depiction of Joseph Smith's First Vision. He said that Jesus and God the Father told him that all the churches of his day were corrupt and abominable. Restorationism is a broad category of churches, originating during the Second Great Awakening, that characterize themselves as a return to very early Christianity after the true faith was lost in a Great Apostasy. Prominent among these groups are the Churches of Christ (Stone-Campbell movement) and the Latter Day Saint movement (Mormonism). The idea of \\"restoration\\" was a popular theme of the time of the founding of these branches, and developed an independent expression in both.C. Leonard Allen and Richard T. Hughes, \\"Discovering Our Roots: The Ancestry of the Churches of Christ,\\" p. 94, Abilene Christian University Press, 1988, Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L. Dunnavant, The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, p. 544-545, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Mormonism In the Stone-Campbell movement, the idea of restoration was combined with Enlightenment rationalism, \\"precluding emotionalism, spiritualism, or any other phenomena that could not be sustained by rational appeals to the biblical text.\\" =Seventh-Day Adventist= The Seventh-Day Adventist Church (SDA Church) holds itself to be the one true church. It specifically teaches that \\"it is the 'final remnant' of His true church [spanning] the centuries\\". Seventh-day Adventist eschatology promulgates the idea that in the end times, there will be an \\"growing opposition between the 'true' church and the 'apostate' church.\\" According to Seventh-day Adventist theology, these apostates are referred to as \\"Babylon\\", which they state is an amalgam of religions (including other Christian denominations) that worship on the Lord's Day (Sunday) rather than the Sabbath (Saturday). The SDA Church, in their view, \\"has drawn substantially on the biblical text, especially the books of Daniel and Revelation, to argue for its own status as the true remnant church which has a divine commission both to exist and to preach its apocalyptic message to the world at large.\\" =Latter Day Saint movement= In 1830, Joseph Smith established the Church of Christ (Latter Days Saints) in the belief that it was a restoration of original Christianity. In 1831 he declared it to be \\"the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth\\".Doctrine and Covenants section I (1835 ed.). Smith later reported that during his First Vision in his teenage years, Jesus had told him that all churches that then existed \\"were all wrong; [and] that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight\\".Joseph Smith‚ÄìHistory 1:19, Pearl of Great Price (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 1981.) The Latter Day Saints combined their religion with \\"the spirit of nineteenth-century Romanticism\\" and, as a result, \\"never sought to recover the forms and structures of the ancient church as ends in themselves\\" but \\"sought to restore the golden age, recorded in both Old Testament and New Testament, when God broke into human history and communed directly with humankind.\\" The predominant organization within the movement is the LDS Church, which continues to teach that it is \\"the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth\\". The church teaches that all people who achieve the highest level of salvation must be baptized into the LDS Church; however, those who missed that opportunity in their lifetime may be included through a proxy baptism for the dead, in which a worthy church member is baptized on their behalf inside a temple.https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel- topics/baptisms-for-the-dead?lang=eng Most other Latter Day Saint churches claim to be the rightful continuation or successor of the church Smith established and therefore claim to be the one true church. However, the Community of Christ, the second-largest Latter Day Saint church, has recently de-emphasized this belief in favor of a position that the Community of Christ \\"is part of the whole body of Christ\\".\\"Basic Beliefs\\", cofchrist.org. The church's canonized Doctrine and Covenants continues to contain the declaration that the church is the \\"only true and living church\\". =Iglesia ni Cristo= The Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) a Philippine-based Christian religion, like other restorationist groups, professes that it is the one church founded by Jesus. Adherents hold that the Iglesia ni Cristo (\\"Church of Christ\\" in Tagalog) is the only true church of Jesus Christ as restored through a human instrument (sugo) Felix Manalo. The church recognizes Jesus Christ as the founder of the Christian Church. Meanwhile, its reestablishment is seen as the signal for the end of days. They believe that the church was apostatized by the 1st or 4th century due to false teachings. The INC says that this apostate church is the Roman Catholic Church. Members believe that the Iglesia ni Cristo is the fulfillment of the passage above. Based from their doctrines, \\"ends of the earth\\" pertains to the time the true church would be restored from apostasy and \\"east\\" refers to the Philippines where the \\"Church of Christ\\" would be founded. The INC teaches that its members constitute the \\"elect of God\\" and there is no salvation outside the INC. Faith alone is insufficient for salvation. The Iglesia ni Cristo says that the official name of the true church is \\"Church of Christ\\". The two passages often cited by INC to support this are Romans 16:16 \\"Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you\\"(Pasugo, November 1973, 6) and the George Lamsa translation of Acts 20:28: \\"Take heed therefore ... to feed the church of Christ which he has purchased with his blood.\\"(Lamsa translation; cited in Pasugo, April 1978) See also * Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus * Great Church * One true faith * Religious exclusivism References Category:Ecclesiology Category:Christian terminology ","title":"One true church"},{"id":"21520747","text":"Ludmierzyce () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Kietrz, within G≈Çubczyce County, Opole Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, close to the Czech border.

In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form. Organs consist of different tissues, one or more of which prevail and determine its specific structure and function. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Viscera are the soft organs of the body. There are organs and systems of organs that differ in structure and development but they are united for the performance of a common function. Such functional collection of mixed organs, form an organ system. These organs are always made up of special cells that support its specific function. The normal position and function of each visceral organ must be known before the abnormal can be ascertained. Healthy organs all work together cohesively and gaining a better understanding of how, helps to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Some functions cannot be accomplished only by one organ. That is why organs form complex systems. The system of organs is a collection of homogeneous organs, which have a common plan of structure, function, development, and they are connected to each other anatomically and communicate through the NEI supersystem.

The likely mechanism of 1,2-dioxetanedione formation from peroxyoxalate in base is illustrated below: Mechanism of 1,2-Dioxetanedione Generation 1,2-Dioxetanedione will rapidly decompose into carbon dioxide (CO2). If there is no fluorescer present, only heat will be released. However, in the presence of a fluorescer, light can be generated (chemiluminescence). Peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence (CL) was first reported by Rauhut in 1967 [1] in the reaction of diphenyl oxalate. The emission is generated by the reaction of an oxalate ester with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a suitably fluorescent energy acceptor. This reaction is used in glow sticks. glowsticks using peroxyoxalate CL The three most widely used oxalates are bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)oxalate (TCPO), Bis(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl-6-carbopentoxyphenyl)oxalate (CPPO) and bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl) oxalate (DNPO). Other aryl oxalates have been synthesized and evaluated with respect to their possible analytical applications [2]. Divanillyl oxalate, a more eco-friendly or \\"green\\" oxalate for chemiluminescence, decomposes into the nontoxic, biodegradable compound vanillin and works in nontoxic, biodegradable triacetin [16] . Peroxyoxalate CL is an example of indirect or sensitized chemiluminescence in which the energy from an excited intermediate is transferred to a suitable fluorescent molecule, which relaxes to the ground state by emitting a photon. Rauhut and co-workers have reported that the intermediate responsible for providing the energy of excitation is 1,2-dioxetanedione [1,3]. The peroxyoxalate reaction is able to excite many different compounds, having emissions spanning the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum [3,4], and the reaction can supply up to 440 kJ mol-1, corresponding to excitation at 272 nm [5]. It has been found, however, that the chemiluminescence intensity corrected for quantum yield decreases as the singlet excitation energy of the fluorescent molecule increases [6]. There is also a linear relationship between the corrected chemiluminescence intensity and the oxidation potential of the molecule [6]. This suggests the possibility of an electron transfer step in the mechanism, as demonstrated in several other chemiluminescence systems [7-10]. It has been postulated that a transient charge transfer complex is formed between the intermediate 1,2-dioxetanedione and the fluorescer [11], and a modified mechanism was proposed involving the transfer of an electron from the fluorescer to the reactive intermediate [12]. The emission of light is thought to result from the annihilation of the fluorescer radical cation with the carbon dioxide radical anion formed when the 1,2-dioxetanedione decomposes [13]. This process is called chemically induced electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL). Mechanism of chemiluminescence from electron transfer from 1,2-dioxetanedione to a fluorescer Chemiluminescent reactions are widely used in analytical chemistry [14, 15] References #M.M. Rauhut, L.J.

Early life Ursula Bagdasarjanz was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, to a mother who was herself a violinist. The seeds of Ursula's musical talent were sown in the cradle, or, as she herself believes, were bestowed as a gift to accompany her through life. Her father, Samuel Bagdasarjanz was born in Romania, whence his family emigrated to Switzerland. Through her mother, Margrit Weiss, born in Switzerland, Ursula learned at an early age to express herself on her instrument. In 1944, at the age of ten, Ursula Bagdasarjanz gave her first concert (Beethoven Romance in F major). Her teachers were Aida Stucki in Winterthur, Switzerland (1944‚Äì1953), Marcel Reynal at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur de Musique in Paris, France (1953‚Äì1956), where she was awarded the \\"Premier Prix de Violon\\" in 1956, and S√°ndor V√©gh in Basel, Switzerland (1957 and 1958). She took masterclasses with Joseph Calvet in Paris and Max Rostal in Bern. At the time Ursula Bagdasarjanz was taking violin lessons from Aida Stucki, the latter was herself a student of Carl Flesch, one of the most famous violin educators ever. This was a stroke of luck: as a child, Ursula Bagdasarjanz had already had the chance of familiarising herself with a unique method of work for violinists, the Carl Flesch scale system. In 2000, another Aida Stucki student, the virtuoso violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, wrote the introduction to Eric Rosenblith's new edition (published in English) to Carl Flesch's book on \\"The Art of Violin Playing\\". Another violinist having done extensive work on the Carl Flesch's works was Max Rostal. He published a new, revised and broader edition of the scale system in 1987 and passed his in-depth knowledge of the standard works of Carl Flesch on to students attending his masterclasses. As both soloist and a chamber musician, Ursula Bagdasarjanz pursued an active concert career. She did much for the composer Othmar Schoeck. She performed a full range of his violin works, including recordings of all his violin sonatas, accompanied by Gisela Schoeck, the composer's daughter.  Concert performance 1956‚Äì1982 overview  Before beginning her studies at the Conservatoire National Sup√©rieur in Paris, Ursula Bagdasarjanz was awarded 1st prize at the Concours Bellan in Paris, France. While still studying, she made her first radio recording with Radio Paris-Inter. Many were to follow with the same station. After having completed her studies with the \\"Premier Prix de Violon\\", she returned to Switzerland. Her substantial concert career led her, in addition to solo performances in Switzerland, to a long concert tour in Spain, Germany, and Finland, where she became the Turku City Orchestra soloist. In Switzerland, she repeatedly performed as soloist with great orchestras and famous conductors, such as the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich and the city orchestras of Winterthur (in Winterthur, Glarus and Uster), St. Gallen, Aarau, Solothurn and Olten as well as the \\"Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana\\". Ursula Bagdasarjanz gave violin concerts and recitals at many music centres abroad: in Switzerland and, among others, in Barcelona, Berlin, Heidelberg, Darmstadt, Zurich, Winterthur, Geneva, Schaffhausen, Basel, Bern, Rorschach, Rapperswil, Herisau, and Stans. Her recordings in the radio studios of Zurich, Lugano, Paris, and Berlin contributed significantly to making her more renowned as a Swiss soloist. Ursula Bagdasarjanz performed as soloist and narrator in a ZDF TV documentary, which introduced the public to a Swiss industrialist's pre- eminent collection of Stradivarius instruments. She was also part of the \\"Tonhalle Wettbewerb Zurich\\" jury (competition by Tonhalle Zurich). In July 2001, 2002 and in 2004, Ursula Bagdasarjanz was invited to Romania to give violin master classes in T√¢rgu-Mure≈ü. She was also a member of the jury of the Constantin Silvestri music competition. Ursula Bagdasarjanz gave an interview to radio Bucure≈üti. Her CDs are highly appreciated. Her long co-operation with the pianist Gisela Schoeck, the daughter of the composer Othmar Schoeck, should be particularly noted. In addition, in June 1995, Ursula Bagdasarjanz was heard with Dr. Knaus on \\"Musik √† la Carte\\", the Swiss Radio DRS broadcast, accompanied by music pieces from her CDs.

Recordings by the legendary violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz (b. 1934) are much prized by contemporary collectors, most especially her 1961 cycle of Othmar Schoeck's complete music for violin and piano with the composer's gifted daughter Gisela (Gallo CD-1249). The second volume in a reissue of these classic radio tapes features the op.22 variations and the op.16 and 46 sonatas in performances so authoritative and responsive to the music's remote idiom (think Hindemith with added warmth and charm) that it is impossible to imagine them ever being superseded. The mono recordings have been transferred most expertly, with plenty of body to the sound and a smooth treble response. Fanfare Magazine, 6 August 2010, by Adrian Corleonis. Ursula Bagdasarjanz: Schoeck Violin Sonatas on Gallo Classical Reviews ‚Äì Composers & Works Chez Bagdasarjanz and Gisela Schoeck, the first sonata's lyricism and crackling high spirits awaken to sheer vivacity; the second's rumination's and eeriness acquire a mordant and suddenly compelling conviction, lifting both works into a dimension only half-heartedly hinted at in other readings. The early 1905 sonata without opus number takes on a heretofore unexpected charm. Rescued from Swiss radio tapes made in 1961, Gallo's sound is close, well balanced, and detailed. A companion issue featuring Bagdasarjanz performing Schoeck's Violin Concerto with the Lugano Radio Symphony (Gallo CD-1250) exhibits a similar nuance-rife fluency, while one hopes that more tapes of Gisela Schoeck will surface - her brilliance and swagger through the sonatas make one avid to hear her again in any repertoire. Enthusiastically recommended. ‚Äì Adrian Corleonis Fanfare Magazine, 6 October 2010, by Adrian Corleonis. Departments - Want List Accompanying the volatile, inspired violinistics of Ursula Bagdasarjanz, Gisela Schoeck animates her father's violin sonatas with an expressive flair beside which even the most sympathetic performances of all other would-be interpreters seem stodgy, academic. These artifacts raise the question once again, If one has heard a work only in competently clueless, professionally respectable performances, has one really heard it?'' The WholeNote, November 2010, by Terry Robbins. Ursula Bagdasarjanz Vol. 1: Bach; Nardini; Mozart; Bart√≥k Ursula Bagdasarjanz; Luciano Sgrizzi; Fernande Kaeser (Gallo CD-1248) Ursula Bagdasarjanz Vol. 2 - Othmar Schoeck Ursula Bagdasarjanz; Gisela Schoeck (Gallo CD-1249) Current Reviews - Early, Classical and Beyond Volume One features works by Bach, Nardini, Mozart and Bart√≥k, recorded between 1960 and 1969, and demonstrates not only Bagdasarjanz's performance range but also the consistent elements in her playing: a big, warm tone; faultless intonation; a fairly heavy (but not wide) vibrato which is always used intelligently and sensitively; and a sophisticated sense of phrasing. The Bach A minor solo sonata is technically flawless, with a great sense of line and some remarkably tight triple-stopping in the Fuga. The big tone is evident in the Nardini D major sonata, the Mozart Bb major sonata K378, and Bart√≥k's First Rhapsody. The piano sound is slightly fuzzy in the Nardini, but otherwise the transfers are excellent. \\"By far the most significant of the two CDs, however, is Volume Two, which features the complete works for violin and piano by the Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck. Recorded for Swiss Radio in 1961, only 4 years after the composer‚Äôs death, the three sonatas feature Schoeck‚Äôs daughter Gisela as the accompanist in performances that The Strad magazine rightly called ‚Äúso authoritative‚Ä¶ that it is impossible to imagine them ever being superseded.‚Äù All three sonatas ‚Äì Op.16, Op.22 and Op.46 - are not part of the standard repertoire and are rarely performed these days, which is a real shame; the first two in particular, dating from the early 1900s, are strongly personal works reminiscent of Brahms and Franck. Again, the re- mastered sound is excellent.\\" \\"If you know Bagdasarjanz‚Äôs playing ‚Äì and recordings of her have always been pretty scarce ‚Äì then you won‚Äôt need to be told to get these CDs; if you don‚Äôt know her playing, get them anyway ‚Äì you won‚Äôt be disappointed!\\" American Record Guide, 1/2011, by MAGIL SCHOECK Violin Sonatas Ursula Badgasarjanz (violin), Gisela Schoeck (piano) Gallo 1249, 50 minutes Othmar Schoeck (1886-1957) was one of Switzerland's leading composers in the first half of the 20th Century. These works for violin show the influence of Brahms and a good deal of technical proficiency. While Schoeck lacked the trailblazing imagination of the very greatest composers, his themes are lovely, his harmonic knowledge has an impressive range, and his material is expertly worked out. These are satisfying works, and as I listen to them I never feel that they are lacking. Of the three works presented here, the First and Second Violin Sonatas are the best. The Second is more harmonically fluid, but the First has stronger themes and is more affecting. The Variations, without opus number, don't hold my interest as well. They are from 1905, the earliest of the three works, so that comes as no surprise. Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz recorded these pieces for Swiss radio in 1961. The composer's daughter Gisela plays the piano and does a very fine job. The sound is a bit dry, and I wish the piano were a bit more forward, but these are very good readings. Fanfare Magazine by Robert Maxham, February 2012. ¬© Ursula Bagdasarjanz: The fifth volume of Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz's CD-collection The fifth volume of Swiss violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz's collection of studio and live recordings on the Gallo label contains three sonatas, one each by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Johannes Brahms. She and pianist Luciano Sgrizzi recorded Mozart's Sonata in G Major in Studio Lugano in April 1963; the engineers surrounded the duo with very little reverberation and Bagdasarjanz sounds very close up, but the realistic recorded sound virtually places a listener in the room (or places the listener in a virtual room) with the musicians. In general, Bagdasarjanz combines rhythmic incisiveness with almost period starchiness tonally and stylistically. But her vibrant sense of and fidelity to what she obviously believes to be the music's rhetoric combine to make her reading of Mozart commanding and, ultimately, convincing ‚Äî especially in the first movement, in which she reveals an unsuspected urgency. Not so suave in Mozart as Arthur Grumiaux or so sharply focused on detail as Catherine Mackintosh, she combines the best aspects of both approaches and deserves on the basis of this reading to be mentioned alongside them on any shortlist of Mozart interpreters. The live performances of Beethoven's and Brahms's sonatas with pianist Bruno F. Saladin come from 1964, approximately the same date as the studio recording of Mozart. Caught at a greater distance in them, her tone loses some of its edge and her reading correspondingly loses some of its detail, but there's enough left for any normal recorded sound. Her reading of the ‚ÄúKreutzer‚Äù Sonata takes a very different tack than that of Jascha Heifetz or Zino Francescatti, whose performances set a sort of benchmark in white-hot intensity; Bagdasarjanz seems from the first notes of the introduction warm rather than hot. Her reading, for example, of what I‚Äôve called the Janissary theme doesn't rollick with whipped-up frenzy, but presents a different and, again, as in Mozart, a convincing, though kinder and gentler, view. Not that the reading lacks the passion that might inspire a novel, but it's diverted through calmer and more amiable streams. Bagdasarjanz plays the theme of the variation movement with a warmth, subtlety, and geniality that sound like Fritz Kreisler's ‚Äî except that Kreisler himself played the theme more straightforwardly and with greater rhythmic springiness. That geniality continues through the first two variations (Bagdasarjanz sounds particularly silvery in the second of them), but she and Saladin dim the lights for the minore variation. The following maggiore serves in this reading almost as a Hegelian synthesis of the preceding two, while the Molto adagio sums everything up in a penetrating synopsis. If the somewhat slow tempo at the finale's opening makes the reading sound less urgent at its outset, her tonal weight and general storminess still generate plenty of driving force. Bagdasarjanz soars in the first movement of Brahms's sonata; her reading never seems undesirably light in weight or tone (an analogous predication in the terms of scholastic philosophy). In fact, her tone, though pure and mercurial in the upper registers, remains almost seductively dusky in the lower ones. In the slow movement's opening passages, it oozes with honeyed richness. Only very occasionally does security falter in the third movement (but it's a live recording); on the other hand, the brisk reading of the finale sweeps everything before it with concerto-like massiveness. Bagdasarjanz's recital, assembled from various sources, makes a satisfying whole, not least because of the violinist's integrity and insight into each of the styles she channels. Very strongly recommended as playing of the very first order, in music of the very first order: a wonderful way of encountering Bagdasarjanz, either for the first time or on a repeat visit. ‚Äì Robert Maxham Music education, Paris, France, 2012 MOZART-BEETHOVEN-BRAHMS. VDE Gallo (www.vdegallo.ch) : CD 1352. TT : 78‚Äô27. Violinist Ursula Bagdasarjanz, who has said, \\"I get my energy from music: it is the breath that gives rhythm to my life,\\" is, as a concert performer, virtuoso and pedagogue, one of the most prominent figures in Swiss musical life. For the culmination of her international career, she has put together a collection of CDs with radio and digitally remastered recordings (2008-2011), as well as a live recording. In this fifth volume, accompanied by pianist Luciano Sgrizzi, she performs Mozart's Sonata in G Major, K. 302 (1963, Studio Lugano), with remarkable sonority and sensitivity; and with pianist Bruno F. Saladin, Beethoven's famous \\"Kreutzer\\" Sonata in A Major, op. 47, and Brahms's Sonata in D Minor, op. 108, both recorded live in 1964. These are lovely reminders of a glorious musical and artistic past, whose future is assured by this disc, which will delight violinists well beyond the borders of Switzerland.

Spiti is a high altitude or cold desert having close similarities to the neighbouring Tibet and Ladakh regions in terms of terrain, climate and the Buddhist culture. Kaza, situated along the Spiti River at an elevation of above mean sea level, is the largest township and commercial center of the Spiti valley. Description The town is divided into the old, as Kaza Khas and new as Kaza Soma sections. The new town contains the administrative buildings. The Tangyud (Tang-rGyud) Gompa dates to the early 14th century and is built like a fortified castle with massive slanted mud walls and battlements with vertical red ochre and white vertical stripes. It is on the edge of a deep canyon and overlooking the town of Kaza, 4 km from the town.Handa (1987), pp. 83-85.Kapadia (1999), p. 204. Approaching it from the south one sees Kyu-ling (Skyid-gling), the stately palace of the Nono (king) on the other side of the river.Francke (1914), p. 44. Access Kaza is overlooked by high mountain ridges on all sides. It has two access points : one from Kinnaur valley and the other from the Lahaul valley, 11 km from Ki Monastery, the famous Gelugpa establishment. The route through Kinnaur is open throughout the year, except for occasional short periods resulting from landslides or heavy snowfall. This road, starting from Shimla, follows the Sutlej river unto a little beyond Poo, thereafter turning northwards to follow the Spiti river all the way to Kaza. The other road starts from Manali and after crossing the high Rohtang Pass to reach Gramphoo where it joins the road from Keylong and proceeds south along Chandra River till Batal then climbs up to cross the high Kunzum pass, enters the Spiti valley to reach Kaza. It remains closed during winter months, normally from October end to June due to heavy snowfall on both the passes. Kaza is the one of the coldest towns in India. The temperature varies greatly in a different seasons and during a day, January is the coldest month of the year with an average temperature of -25 ¬∞C,while July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 10 ¬∞C. Festivals & Tourism Warning sign by Spiti District Administration near Kaza - Kunzum La Road Kaza is known for its colorful festivals and the ancient Sakya Tangyud Monastery, 14 km from the town. It is also popular with tourists and adventure seekers during the period of June, July and August and September because of its central location and connections to the rest of the valley (Connects to Leh-Manali Highway via Kunzum Pass). This central location also makes Kaza an ideal base camp for trekking, mountaineering, and tours directed to other parts of the valley. Festivals like Fagli and Gochi are celebrated. Hindus also celebrate their festivals like harvest festival, festival of light. There are various fairs like Ladarcha fair, Pauri fair, Tribal fair and Tsheshu fair. Kaza‚Äôs Ladachar Fair, Lauhal and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh are the most renowned fairs of the place, these fairs indicate the termination of summer season in the region. Previously, Ladarcha fair used to be celebrated in Kibbar maidan in Spit in the month of July where traders from Ladakh, Rampur Busher and Spiti meet in this fair to barter their produce. Due to closure of Tibetan traders, this fair is now being celebrated at Kaza, the headquarters of Spiti Sub Division in the 3rd week of August.

One of the politically moderate Hutus in the National Unity Cabinet, he became increasingly disenchanted with the RPF and was eventually forced from office in 1995 after criticizing government policies. After surviving a 1996 assassination attempt while in exile in Kenya, he launched a new opposition movement, the Forces de R√©sistance pour la D√©mocratie (FRD). Sendashonga was killed by unidentified gunmen in May 1998. The Rwandan government is widely believed to be responsible for the assassination. Biography Sendashonga was a leader of a student movement opposed to the rule of Rwandan president Juv√©nal Habyarimana and been forced to leave the country in 1975.\\"Human Rights Watch and the FIDH Condemn Assassination of Seth Sendashonga\\", Human Rights Watch, May 17, 1998 In 1992 Sendashonga joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the rebel group then fighting the Rwandan Civil War against the Habyarimana government. The RPF took power after defeating the Hutu Power-led government that carried out the Rwandan genocide.\\"Slain Rwandan was to testify at genocide court\\", CNN, May 18, 1998 Sendashonga was able to use his considerable personal prestige to convince other Hutu moderates to joint the RPF government.  Minister of the Interior  Following their victory, the RPF created a Government of National Unity in July 1994, and invited Sendashonga, a politically moderate Hutu, to be the Minister of the Interior. For much of his tenure, Sendashonga had written a barrage of memos to Kagame about killings and forced disappearances that were reported to have been carried out by elements of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). On 19 April 1995, Sendashonga rushed to Kibeho in an attempt to calm the situation after RPA soldiers shot several Hutus in an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp. After returning to Kigali, he briefed Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President/Defense Minister Paul Kagame and sought assurances that the RPA would exercise restraint. Following the massacre of a large number of IDPs at Kibeho on the 22nd, the RPA refused Sendashonga entry to the area. After his attempt to seek redress for the victims of Kibeho was turned down, Sendashonga came to the conclusion that the 'Ugandan Tutsi' who controlled the RPF would not tolerate any dissent and were willing to carry out mass murder to achieve their goals. However, both Sendashonga and Twagiramungu, also a Hutu, thought that the situation might be salvaged as the political split did not precisely mirror ethnic lines; some Francophone Tutsi politicians in the RPF felt excluded by the English-speaking Tutsis who had come from Uganda. Sendashonga decided to take a stand against arbitrary arrests after 15 prisoners had suffocated to death after being detained some days after Kibeho, stating, while cautiously referring to detainees as 'criminals', \\"Of late many criminals have been arrested following the closure of Kibeho camp, thus making the prisons full beyond their capacity.\\" This infuriated Kagame, who some days before had given a speech proclaiming, \\"Over 95% of the former Kibeho people have returned to their homes and are in good shape.\\" Tensions in the cabinet worsened after Rose Kabuye, mayor of Kigali, announced the creation of city residency permits that would be given \\"only to blameless persons\\" and would be color-coded green for old residents and blue for refugees returning from Zaire, who were suspected of being associated with the old Hutu regime. This announcement panicked the Hutu populace, who rushed to get this vital document, before Sendashonga canceled the entire permit plan through his authority over the Interior Department. By this point, the RPF Department of Military Intelligence had leaked a memo to the press that stated that Sendashonga, Minister of Finance Marc Ruganera and Vice Prime Minister Col. Alexis Kanyarengwe, all Hutus, were under their watch. As the killings and disappearances continued without any pause, Sendashonga made the dramatic decision to disband the Local Defense Forces (LDF), which had been set up to replace the police after the genocide but were subsequently linked to a large number of arrests, murders and disappearances. However, the LDF was the tool the RPF used to keep track of rural areas, further aggravating Defense Minister Kagame. As a minister, the government could not attack Sendashonga directly, but the RPF began to accuse Sendashonga's brother of various misdeeds. As things reached a breaking point, Twagiramungu called a special council of ministers on security matters that began on August 23. Running for three days, the meeting turned into a conflict between Kagame and Sendashonga, who received the backing of Twagiramungu, Ruganera and, somewhat surprisingly, Aloysia Inyumba, the Tutsi minister of women's affairs. In the final showdown, Twagiramungu confronted Kagame about how, of the 145 bourgmestres appointed by the RPF, 117 were Tutsi, to which Kagame left the room, ending the meeting. Over 95% of the February/March nominees for posts at the local administration levels of paroisse, commune, and pr√©fecture were 'foreign' Tutsi. Two days later, Prime Minister Twagiramungu resigned, but was outmaneuvered by President Bizimungu, who did not want him to leave the government on his own terms. On 28 August, Bizimungu came before Parliament and asked for a public vote that succeeded in firing Twagiramungu. The next day, Sendashonga, Minister of Transport and Communications Immacul√©e Kayumba, Minister of Justice Alphonse-Marie Nkubito and Minister of Information Jean-Baptiste Nkuriyingoma were fired. Sendashonga and Twagiramungu were placed under house arrest and their documents examined for any incriminating evidence, but were eventually allowed to leave the country unharmed by the end of the year.  Exile and assassination attempt  Sendashonga went into exile in Nairobi, Kenya. There he planned to fly to Brussels, Belgium to launch a new opposition movement called the Forces de R√©sistance pour la D√©mocratie (FRD) with his old colleague and fellow Hutu moderate Faustin Twagiramungu. In February 1996, Sendashonga received a call from a fellow Rwandan exile offering to give him documents proving that there had been an attempted mutiny within the RPF. When he went to the appointment, he was met by two men who ambushed him, hitting him twice with bullets fired from pistols. His life was not endangered, but his nephew, who was with him, was seriously injured. Sendashonga recognized one of the would-be assassins as his former bodyguard from when he was a minister. The other was Francis Mgabo, a staff member at the local Rwandan embassy, who was subsequently discovered attempting to dispose of the pistol he had used in the attack in the restroom of a local gas station. The government of Kenya asked Rwanda to withdraw Mgabo's diplomatic immunity so he could be arrested and put on trial. Rwanda refused, resulting in a row between the two countries in which Kenya closed the Rwanda embassy and the two countries temporarily broke off diplomatic relations. After recovering from his wounds, Sendashonga carried out his plan to start the FRD opposition party in Brussels. French historian G√©rard Prunier states that the party platform, which included an in-depth critique of the 1994 genocide, was \\"a very valuable contribution because it was an honest and realistic assessment of the genocide from a mostly Hutu political group.\\" However, Sendashonga's assertion that the enemy was not the Tutsi, but rather the RPF under Kagame, was subject to harsh criticism by other Hutu politicians who accused him of being weak. Conversely, Sendashonga said of the former genocidaire Hutu leadership in refugee camps of Zaire, \\"Their only political program is to kill Tutsis.\\" At the same time, several of his old Tutsi colleagues in the RPF continued to feed him information about events within Rwanda, apparently in the belief that he would be needed once again once the violence had run its course. However, Sendashonga realized that only the groups using violence were shaping events, stating to Prunier, \\"Everybody uses a gun as a way of sitting at the negotiation table one day. If I always refuse to use guns, I'll be marginalized when the time comes.\\" Sendashonga had attracted about 600 soldiers and 40 officers of the old Rwandan Armed Forces, who were willing to fight for him because they saw him as an alternative to the RPF and the Hutu Army for the Liberation of Rwanda, whom they felt were motivated by opposing forms of violent racism. After Tanzania agreed to host Sendashonga's rebel training camps, he used his contacts with Prunier to go to Uganda and talk to Salim Saleh, President Yoweri Museveni's brother, on 3 May 1998. Relations between Uganda and Rwanda had deteriorated and Salim was open to the idea of a new force to counter the RPF. Sendashonga then met Eva Rodgers of the United States Department of State, who was noncommittal but did not outright oppose the formation of the new armed group.  Assassination  On 16 May 1998, at about 5 pm, Sendashonga was being driven home in his wife's United Nations Environmental Programme car when he was shot and killed, along with his driver Jean-Bosco Nkurubukeye, by two gunmen firing AK-47s. Twagiramungu, still in Brussels, declared, \\"I'm pointing to the RPF and its government\\" and was echoed by a number of other exiled political groups, though the RPF government denied any involvement.\\"KENYA: Former Rwandan minister Sendashonga murdered\\" in IRIN Update No. 418 for Central and Eastern Africa, IRIN, 16‚Äì18 May 1998 Three men, David Kiwanuka, Charles Muhaji and Christopher Lubanga were arrested by the Kenyan police. Kiwanuka was claimed to be Rwandan, despite his typically Muganda name, while Muhaji and Lubanga were identified as Ugandan. The three had been identified, in what Prunier derides as a story \\"obviously fed by rather untalented Kigali security operatives\\", by Kenyan taxi driver Ali Abdul Nasser, who claimed that the three men had tried to hire him as a paid killer because Sendashonga had stolen $54 million in a criminal partnership with Kiwanuka's father, who the Nairobi police claimed to have been the Director of Immigration Services in Kigali, and who had subsequently been supposedly killed by Sendasonga so he would not have to share the loot. This story ran into serious problems when the actual Director of Immigration Services, a man named Charles Butera, surfaced to state that he was alive, that he had no son named Kiwanuka, that he knew Sendashonga only as a brief acquaintance, and that nobody had ever stolen $54 million. Despite the problems with the Kenyan criminal case, the three men remained in jail until 31 May 2001, when they were released from jail by a Kenyan court which found that the murder was political and blamed the Rwandan government. In a December 2000 hearing, Sendashonga's widow, Cyriaque Nikuze, claimed that the Rwandan government was behind the assassination and revealed that he had been scheduled to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the French Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry. Sendashonga, who had agreed to testify for the defense in the trial of Obed Ruzindana, would have been the first current or former member of the RPF to testify before the International Criminal Tribunal. Nikuze claims that the Rwandan embassy official Alphonse Mbayire, who was the acting ambassador at the time, organized the assassination. Mbayire was recalled by his government in January 2001, immediately after Nikuze's accusation and shortly before a new hearing was to begin, only to be shot dead by unidentified gunmen in a Kigali bar on 7 February 2001.

There are around 120 genera and 1300 species. The family was established based on the type genus Endomychus, a genus erected in 1795 by Panzer which was applied to a species that Linnaeus called as Chrysomela coccinea. As the common name suggests, Endomychidae feed on fungi. Crowson, in his influential treatment of the beetles, placed the family within the Cucujoidea. They have a tarsal formal of 4-4-4 or 3-3-3 and the wings lack a closed radial cell. The second antennal segment has a sensory appendage that is as long as the third antennal segment. The family has also been grouped with the Coccinellidae in a group called the Trimera for having pseudotrimerous tarsi. A 2015 molecular phylogeny study found that the Cucujoidea were found to be non-monophyletic and the Endomychidae was refined with the removal of the Anamorphinae from within the family and elevated to the status of a full family, Anamorphidae.

Siftables were developed as a platform for hands-on interactions with digital information and media and were the prototype for Sifteo cubes. Siftables were created by David Merrill and Jeevan Kalanithi when they were graduate students at the MIT Media Lab. Merrill and Kalanithi are friends from their undergraduate years at Stanford, where they both majored in symbolic systems, Merrill focusing on human- computer interaction and Kalanithi on artificial intelligence and neuroscience. Merrill and Kalanithi were surrounded by colleagues at the Media Lab who were working on wireless sensor networks (e.g. the Tribble project,Tribble) and tangible user interfaces (e.g. Topobo Topobo). Merrill and Kalanithi wanted to create a general-purpose tangible user interface that leveraged the technologies of wireless sensor networks. From this idea came the idea of interactive tiles that would enable people to interact with collections of virtual objects‚Äîdigital pictures, document files, etc.‚Äîin the same way that people interact with collections of small physical objects like LEGO ‚Äîanother common sight at the Media Lab. The initial applications envisioned for Siftables were organizing personal media (digital photos, songs, videos) and facilitating business processes, such as coordinating people, distributing tasks, and creating Gantt charts. Merrill was invited to present Siftables at the 2009 TED Conference, held in Long Beach / Palm Springs February 3‚Äì7, 2009. During his talk, he demonstrated several applications on Siftables: portraits that reacted to being placed next to one another, mixing colors from \\"paint buckets\\" on adjacent cubes, building the Fibonacci sequence with an arithmetic application, creating words by arranging individual letters, an interactive graphical narrative for children, and constructing a music sequence. The video of Merrill's TED talk quickly went viral once online, attracting over 1 million views. With this indication of widespread interest in the concept of Siftables, Merrill and Kalanithi decided to focus on developing Siftables into a retail product. The transformation of Siftables into Sifteo cubes (the retail product sold by Sifteo, Inc.) required a complete re-implementation of code and hardware. While the underlying capabilities‚Äîthe ability to sense tilting, shaking, rotation, and neighboring‚Äîof Siftables and Sifteo cubes are the same, the technology behind them is significantly different.

The act amended existing UK copyright law, as recommended by a Royal Commission in 1878Macgillivray, E. J., The copyright act, 1911, annotated, 1912 and repealed all previous copyright legislation that had been in force in the UK. The act also implemented changes arising from the first revision of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1908. The act came into force in the UK on 1 July 1912, in the Channel Islands (except Jersey) on 1 July 1912, in Jersey on 8 March 1913, and in the Isle of Man on 5 July 1912. The Copyright Act 1911 applied or extended to all parts of the British Empire. In India the act came into force on 30 October 1912 (with some modifications in terms of its application to Indian law enacted in 1914), in Papua on 1 February 1931, and all other British possessions on 1 July 1912. It was subsequently enacted on various dates in the self-governing dominions and \\"territories under protection\\" of the British Empire. \\"The Copyright Act 1911 (extension to Palestine), 1924 Ordinance\\" covered Mandatory Palestine and later the State of Israel, where in the latter it remained the governing statute until the Israeli 2007 Copyright Act took effect on 25 May 2008.Israel Copyright Act of 2007  The Act  In the two centuries after the Statute of Anne of 1710, which afforded copyright protection to books, other works were afforded copyright protection either through case law, as in the case of music, or through Acts of Parliament, as in the case of engravings, paintings, drawings and photographs, in legislation such as the Engraving Copyright Act 1734 and the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862. The Copyright Act 1911 consolidated previous copyright statutes, and apart from minor exceptions, the Copyright Act 1911 repealed all previous copyright legislation and established a single statute covering all forms of copyright. The 1911 Act implemented the Berne Convention, which abolished the common law copyright in unpublished works and responded to technological developments by conferring copyright on a new type of works not mentioned in the Berne Convention, namely sound recordings. The 1911 Act abolished the need for registration at the Stationers' Hall and provided that copyright is established upon the creation of a work. However, as the 1911 Act come into effect at different times in different countries of the Commonwealth, registration at Stationers' Hall continued to be required in some Commonwealth countries after 1911. The Act also stated that copyright arose in the act of creation, not the act of publishing. The scope of copyright was further widened and producers of sound recordings were granted the exclusive right to prevent others reproducing their recordings, or playing them in public. The act provided that the copyright in literary, dramatic and music works could be infringed by the making of a film or other mechanical performance incorporating the copyrighted works. In Israel, the bulk of amendments were made by the Knesset not to the 1911 Act itself, but to the 1924 Ordinance applying it, resulting in a situation in which the two legal instruments were in conflict - for instance, while the Act set a copyright term of 50 years after the author's death, the Ordinance set a term of 70. Because the Knesset did not amend the Act to respond to further technological developments, the Courts had to apply the Act's definitions, which were centered on artistic works, or types of works not mentioned in it - for instance, phone books, newspapers, restaurant menus and even the codes of Computer Programs were legally deemed \\"books\\" for copyright purposes, regardless of their (usually nonexistent) artistic value. These \\"stretched-boundaries\\" definitions are maintained in the Copyright Act 5778-2007.Copyright Act 5778-2007, Section 1: \\"In this Act -...\\"Literary work\\" ‚Äì including works expressed in writing, lectures, tables, compilations, and computer programs\\"  Summary of changes  British lawyer Evan James MacGillivray summarised the changes in the introduction of his annotated edition of the 1911 Act as follows:  Imperial copyright act  Cover page of the British Copyright Act 1911, also known as the Imperial Copyright Act of 1911. \\"Part I Imperial Copyright. Rights. 1.(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout the parts of His Majesty‚Äôs dominions to which this Act extends for the term hereinafter mentioned in every original literary dramatic music and artists work, if...\\" With the exception of provisions that were expressly restricted to the United Kingdom by the act, all provisions of the Copyright Act 1911 applied \\"throughout His Majesty's dominions\\" and self-governing dominions if enacted by the parliament of that dominion without modifications that were not necessary to adapt the act \\"to the circumstances of the dominion\\". The Copyright Act 1911 was adapted to circumstances and enacted by the then self- governing dominions of Australia (Copyright Act 1912), Newfoundland (Newfoundland Copyright Act 1912) and the Union of South Africa (Patents, Designs, Trade Marks and Copyright Act 1916). The Copyright Act 1911 also provided that the UK Secretary of State could certify copyright laws passed in any self-governing dominion if the copyright legislation was ‚Äúsubstantially identical‚Äù to those of the Copyright Act 1911. Though the Secretary of State could certify copyright law even if their provisions on copyright enforcement and the restriction on importation of works manufactured in ‚Äúforeign countries‚Äù were not identical to that of the Copyright Act 1911. Such self- governing dominions were then treated as if the Copyright Act 1911 extended to the self-governing dominion. The Secretary of State certified the copyright laws of New Zealand (New Zealand Copyright Act 1913, certified April 1914) and Canada (Copyright Act of Canada 1923, certified 1923). The Copyright Act 1911 also provided that ‚ÄúHis Majesty may, by Order in Council, extend this Act to any territories under his protection and to Cyprus‚Äù and the act would then apply to these countries as if they were dominions of the British Empire. In 1912 an Order in Council extended the Copyright Act 1911 to Cyprus and the following territories: Bechuanaland, East Africa, The Gambia, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Northern Nigeria, the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Somaliland, Southern Nigeria, the Solomon Islands, Swaziland, Uganda and Weihaiwei. The Copyright Act 1911 was extended to Palestine by an Order in Council in 1924, it was extended to Tanganyika by an Order in Council in 1924 and 1931, it was extended to the Federated Malay States by an Order in Council in 1931 and 1932, and it was extended to the Cameroons under British Mandate by an Order in Council in 1933.  Influence of the act  The Copyright Act 1911 provided the template for an approach to copyright exceptions where a specific list of exceptions carefully defines permitted uses of the copyrighted work. The 1911 Act formed the basis of UK copyright law and, as an imperial measure, formed the basis for copyright law in most of what were then British colonies and dominions. While many of these countries have had their own copyright law for a considerable number of years, most have followed the imperial model developed in 1911. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa define the limits on and exceptions to copyright by providing an exhaustive list of specifically defined exceptions.  Commonwealth approach to exceptions  This \\"Commonwealth approach\\" to copyright is in contrast with that adopted in US copyright law. US copyright does contain a number of specific exceptions, as well as providing for a fair use defence in section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976. The Section provides a list of illustrative example of uses under this defence, such as criticism, comment and research. In contrast to the Commonwealth fair dealing exceptions, the fair use defence allows US courts to find that a defendant's use is fair and hence not an infringement of copyright, even though the use does not fall within the statutory list provided for in Section 107.

His particular field was teaching English, and he eventually became an academic at the Institute of Education, part of London University. He was a communist activist in the 1930s; after World War II, he became an English teacher and later a teacher trainer; he became a major figure in leftwing thinking in education after leaving the Communist Party in 1957; and he played an important part in debates and developments in the fields of language teaching and primary education, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Biography Origins and youth Rosen was born at Brockton, Massachusetts,John Richmond Obituary: Harold Rosen, The Guardian, 4 August 2008 on 25 June 1919. His mother, Rose, was a Communist activist from the East End of London. Her mother's father and his own father were Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe, and his mother's father had joined the Social Democratic Federation, Britain's first independent socialist party. When Rosen was two years old, his parents separated, and he was taken to the East End by his mother. He was brought up in a mainly observant Jewish environment but in a strongly secular and Communist home.Obituary: Harold Rosen, The Jewish Community, 10 October 2008, accessed at He recalled: \\"The whole family were atheists. But my grandfather had a very sophisticated approach to how to relate to the majority of people who were religious. He was very hard on religion but did not make futile gestures to offend religious people.\\"Harold Rosen, et al \\"The real lives of Eastenders\\", Socialist Worker, 21 August 2004 Rosen was educated at the local state elementary and grammar schools. In 1935, Rosen joined the Young Communist League, youth wing of the Communist Party of Great Britain. There he met Connie Isakofsky. Their emotional, political and professional relationship, and later marriage, were to last until her death from cancer in 1976. They had three sons, Brian (b. 1942), Alan (1944‚Äì1945) and the poet and broadcaster Michael Rosen (b. 1946). Together Rosen and his wife took part in the Battle of Cable Street in 1936, defending the East End against a march by the British Union of Fascists. Teacher Rosen studied English at University College, London, gaining his degree in 1940. Being an American citizen, he was not subject to UK conscription, and went into teaching, working in a number of schools. In 1945 he was drafted into the US Army and served in the education corps in Germany. After his discharge, Rosen took his post-graduate certificate of education at the University of London Institute of Education, where he was a keen sportsman in rugby union and track events. He then taught at Harrow Weald Grammar School, in Middlesex. There he met James Britton and Nancy Martin, who were closely concerned with the development of children's language, and who became his major inspiration and later collaborators. Moving for a shortwhile to Leicestershire, he and Connie made the family home in Pinner. Teaching in Greenford he found his career stalled by the blacklisting of communists. Throughout this period he was an outspoken critic of British colonial policy. When the London County Council launched its great initiative in comprehensive education, Rosen moved to Walworth School in south-east London, a pilot comprehensive just off the Old Kent Road. He was Head of English from 1956 to 1958, where he put the teaching of English on fresh basis, moving from merely studying language to using it.Peter Medway and Pat Kingwell, 'A Curriculum in its place: English teaching in one school 1946‚Äì1963‚Ä≤, History of Education 39, no. 6 (November 2010): 749‚Äì765. This period coincided with his final disenchantment with the CPGB, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary and his disagreements with the Party over structure and organisation. He left the party in 1957, adopting many of the perspectives (without actually joining any particular group) of the New Left, associated with E.P. Thompson, who were strongly interested in problems of class consciousness and working class self-activity, dialectics and praxis. The theory and practice that were worked out at Walworth are the principal contributions associated with Rosen. Essentially, he demanded that teachers reshape the curriculum to respect the experience and culture brought to the curriculum process by the student. The fundamental part of the learning process is the construction of meaning through language. This is brought about through a dialogue between learners and teachers, and among learners themselves. However, the socialist humanism of the New Left was complemented by a strong strand of traditional humanism. Rosen was a major proponent of modern literature in education, bringing works by novelists like J. D. Salinger and William Golding into classrooms still largely dominated by the work of earlier centuries. Teacher of teachers Rosen left Walworth to begin a career in teacher education. He worked first in the Borough Road Teacher Training College in Isleworth, Middlesex, and later in the London Institute of Education, where Britton and Martin were highly influential. At first as their collaborator, and later as head of the English department and professor, Rosen became a major influence in teacher training and the teaching of English. Much of his direct influence was exercised through the London Association for the Teaching of English (LATE), which provided a forum for the capital's teachers and teacher trainers.Simon Gibbons, 'How L.A.T.E. it was, how L.A.T.E.' English in Education 42, no. 2 (Summer 2008): 118‚Äì230. A major product of this collaborative work was a report Language, the Learner and the School,Douglas Barnes, James Britton, Harold Rosen and the LATE, Language, the Learner and the School, Penguin, 1969, he wrote with Britton (by this time at Goldsmith's College) and Douglas Barnes of Leeds, and first issued in 1969. While Barnes contributed a penetrating study of actual language use in the classroom, and Britton a paper on the importance of oral language development, Rosen wrote on behalf of LATE, opening up the question of policy. He called for schools to develop a \\"language policy across the curriculum\\" that would embed a collaborative and language-focussed model in all subjects and affect every aspect of school life. The Language of Primary School Children (1973)Connie and Harold Rosen, The Language of Primary School Children, Penguin, 1973, was a collaborative project between Harold and Connie, his wife, under the auspices of the Schools Council. It incorporated research across many local education authorities to present a detailed picture of how language was hammered out in social interactions. This time a special focus was placed on the potential of educational drama. The rise in the number of students from minority ethnic groups brought new challenges, which he welcomed, encouraging teachers to develop new tactics within the general strategy of getting into students' lives and culture. Connie and Harold were strongly influenced in this work by their own critical reading of the sociolinguists Basil Bernstein and William Labov. These writings played a vital role in stimulating wide debate about the role of language in education and helped force the government to set up an enquiry into the subject. This led to the Bullock Report (A Language for Life) which conceded one of Rosen's major objectives: \\"Each school should have an organised policy for language across the curriculum, establishing every teacher's involvement in language and reading development throughout the years of schooling.\\" Later years Rosen remained engaged and interested in every aspect of education and politics to the end of his life. After Connie died in 1976, he married Betty, an English teacher, in 1978, and it was she who cared for him in his last years. He lived to see his son Michael become Children's Laureate in 2007, while his son Brian has worked most of his life at the Natural History Museum in London and has made major contributions to research and exhibitions there, particularly in the field of marine palaeontology and ecology. Rosen became a founder member of the Society for Storytelling.\\"Remembering Harold Rosen: a personal tribute from Fiona Collins\\" , Society for Storytelling His passion for narrative remained compelled him to pass on his own story. Partly this was embodied in his memoir Are You Still Circumcised?: East End Memories.Harold Rosen Are You Still Circumcised?: East End Memories, Five Leaves Publications, 1999, For most of his life, he wrote poetry. A small selection was published in 2003 called Choose Your Frog.Five Leaves Publications, He remained a passionate critic of US and UK foreign policy and a supporter of the Palestinian cause. In 2004 and 2005, Rosen was interviewed as part of the Social Change and English, 1945‚Äì1965 project, an oral history study of developments in English teaching in post-war secondary schools. Sections of these interviews have now been published.John Hardcastle and Peter Medway \\"In his own words: Harold Rosen on his formative years, with speculations on working-class language\\", Changing English, 16:1 (2009): 5‚Äì14 Selected publications *Language, the Learner and the School (with Douglas Barnes, Penguin, 1969) *Language and class: A critical look at the theories of Basil Bernstein (1972) *The Language of Primary School Children (with Connie Rosen, Penguin, 1973) *Languages and Dialects of London Schoolchildren: An Investigation (with Tyrrell Burgess, 1980) *Speaking from memory: a guide to autobiographical acts and practices (1998) *Are you still circumcised?: East End memories (1999) References Category:1919 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Academics of the UCL Institute of Education Category:Alumni of University College London Category:British educational theorists Category:English people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:English people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:British people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Communist Party of Great Britain members Category:British communists Category:Teachers of English Category:People from Brockton, Massachusetts Category:American emigrants to England Category:Schoolteachers from London ","title":"Harold Rosen (educationalist)"},{"id":"21521300","text":"Wronin (German Vierraben) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Polska Cerekiew, within Kƒôdzierzyn-Ko≈∫le County, Opole Voivodeship, in south- western Poland.

The early 19th and 20th centuries saw a revival of the town, as Reinschdorf was located on the road between Leobsch√ºtz and Cosel, which had become one of the largest inland ports in the German Empire. In 1864 a large sugar mill was built in the town, and in 1882 Reinschdorf was connected to the rail network. Until 1928, the town was parochially administered by the parish of St. Sigismund in Cosel. Though a small neo-Gothic chapel was built in 1861, the town only received its own church in 1924-1926. The present Church of St. Urban was built in 1979-1980. In the Upper Silesian plebiscite of 20 March 1921, 940 villagers (87.6%) voted to remain with Germany, while only 133 people voted to join the newly created state of Poland.Results of the Upper Silesia plebiscite (in German) As a result, Reinschdorf remained in Germany as part of the Weimar Republic. After the Second World War, the Red Army occupied the village, and the town was renamed Re≈Ñska Wies as part of a campaign to Polonize Silesia, which had been annexed to Poland as agreed at the Yalta Conference. However, since unlike many other areas of Silesia the German population had not been completely expelled, there remained a substantial German minority, and since 26 October 2006 the town and commune have been officially bilingual. On January 11, 2011 the old German name Reinschdorf was again made official.

Wealthy sugar factor Henry Lascelles (1690‚Äì1753) bought the house and died there by suicide. Novelist Mary Elizabeth Braddon (1837‚Äì1915), lived there from before 1874 until her death. The house was described in 1907 as a \\"grand old red brick building with a beautiful formal garden\\". Sir Henry George Norris was the final resident. The house and grounds were acquired in 1933 by George Broadbridge and redeveloped into the present two blocks of flats. Design The company estate office and porters' office are situated in the main lobby of the major block. The buildings are surrounded by estate grounds which are a mix of gardens and unallocated parking, the major block having a decorative inner courtyard garden and pond. Initially intended for the rental market, the flats conformed to six different types ranging from studio flats with no alcove, to studio flats with one alcove or two alcoves, and one to three-bedroom flats, some with balconies.

Formerly part of Royal Indian Artillery (RIA) of British Indian Army which itself traces its origins to the formation of Bombay Artillery in 1827. It was later involved in extensive service in the First World War, in East Africa, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia and Palestine . Today it is the second- largest arm of the Indian Army, and with its guns, mortars, rocket launchers, unmanned aerial vehicles, surveillance systems, missiles and artillery firepower it constitutes almost one-sixth of its total strength. Its motto is Sarvatra Izzat-o-Iqbal (Everywhere with Honour and Glory), the Hindustani equivalent of the Royal Artillery motto Ubique Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt (Everywhere That Right And Glory Lead), and it shares the same symbol but with the Star of India in place of the Royal Crown. The Hindustani motto honors the memory of the Hindu and Muslim gunners who fought during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. History The Mughal Emperor Babur is popularly credited with introducing artillery to India, in the Battle of Panipat in 1526, where he decisively used gunpowder firearms and field artillery to defeat the much larger army of Ibrahim Lodhi, the ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, thus not just laying the foundation of the Mughal Empire but also setting a precedent for all future battles in the subcontinent. However, evidence of earlier use of guns by Bahmani kings in the battle of Adoni in 1368 and King Mohammed Shah of Gujarat in the fifteenth century have been recorded. The East India Company raised the first regular company of artillery in 1748, with a small percentage of Indian gunners called Gun Lashkars, Tindals and Serangs. A few Indian mountain artillery batteries, officered by the British, were raised in the 19th century and formed part of the Royal Artillery. The Royal Indian Artillery (RIA) of the British Indian Army was raised on 28 September 1827, as a part of the Bombay Army, a presidency army of the Bombay Presidency. It was later renamed as 5 Bombay Mountain Battery, and participated in the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839‚Äì1842). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 sparked off in Meerut on 10 May 1857. Many of the Indian personnel of the Bengal Artillery were involved in the mutiny and the three battalions of foot artillery then in existence were all disbanded in 1862.W.Y. Carmen, page 12 \\"Indian Army Uniforms under the British.

Major Richard Keatinge of Bombay Artillery was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1858 for his service during the Indian Rebellion. A mountain artillery crew from the British Indian Army demonstrating assembly of the RML 2.5 inch Mountain Gun, ca 1895 In the 20th century, the Artillery was later involved in extensive service in the First World War, in East Africa, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Palestine. The Regiment of Artillery was raised on 15 January 1935, when the first three Indian Field Regiments, originally numbered A, B, and C were authorised. Indian Field Artillery in World War II Originally called the 'Indian Regiment of Artillery', which later became 'The Regiment of Indian Artillery' on 1 November 1940 and 'Royal Regiment of Indian Artillery' in October 1945, after its success in World War II. After the partition of India in 1947 the RIA was divided between the newly formed artillery regiments of India and Pakistan.History of Artillery, Indian Army. In the coming years, the Regiment of Artillery took part in all the operations fought by the Indian Army, the latest being the Kargil War. The School of Artillery of the Indian Army is situated at Devlali near Nashik, and the Regiment of Artillery Museum, established in 1970, is also situated in Nashik at Nasik Road Camp. The Regiment of Artillery was divided in the mid-1990s between the Field Artillery, the Corps of Air Defence Artillery formed in January 1994, and the Army Aviation Corps formed in November 1993.Sawhney, Jane's Defence Weekly, 9 October 1996, p.35 The Field Artillery is the largest successor branch, with 190 regiments, but no longer accounted for a sixth of the army's 1.2 million 1996 strength. Jane's Defence Weekly said in 1996 that divisional artillery deployed on India's plains is expected to have a mix of 130mm and 155mm guns.Pravin Sawhney, 'India's artillery a force in its own right,' Jane's Defence Weekly, 9 October 1996, p.35-37 This could be a combination of three 130mm regiments and one regiment of 155mm guns, or two regiments of each calibre, depending on the anticipated threat and whether the division is to be employed for offensive or defensive operations. On 15 January 1985, a commemorative stamp depicting a gunner and howitzer from Mountain Battery was released by India Post, on the Golden Jubilee of the Regiment of Artillery15th Jan 1985 StampIndia Post. During the 1999 Kargil War, the Indian artillery inflicted heavy damage to Pakistani infiltrators. The role played by the artillery was praised by the top army brass, the divisional commander, a brigade commander and a battalion commander. Two of the officers in that conflict were then Gen. Ved Prakash Malik and then Lt. Gen. Sundararajan Padmanabhan both of whom went on to serve as the Chief of Army Staff. In 2009, 181 Light Battery took a pivotal step in its evolution when it was given the honour of converting to 1812 Rocket Regiment (equipped with the BM-30 Smerch) at Nasirabad. The regiment had the privilege of participating in the Republic Day parade, in New Delhi, on January 26, 2016. Regiment composition According to army history in artillery, the regiments have been classified in the form of caste and culture. Some of the regiments have been divided into the caste system or some in the traditional culture or historical backgrounds. In regiments of artillery, the units have been allotted in the form of Sikhs, Jats, Dogras, Rajputs, Ahirs, Brahmins, Gurkhas, Marathas and SICs (South Indian Classes). There are also two airborne artillery units, 9 (Parachute) Field Regiment and 17 (Parachute) Field Regiment. Most of the artillery units have been affiliated to infantry units. On anniversaries of their raising days, the artillery units invited their affiliated units to join their celebrations. Units and equipment In the artillery, the regiments have been divided into different units. They have been classified into Airborne Regiments (9 and 17 Para Regiments) Medium Regiments, Light Regiments, Missile Regiments, Rocket Regiments (inc 1812 Regiment), Field Regiments, and SATA (Surveillance & Target Acquisition) Regiments and Batteries.
