Issues and activities The NJDC's main issues were the U.S.-Israel relationship, separation of church and state (in the US), and reproductive rights. The NJDC engaged in voter education efforts, and worked with secular and Jewish media to promote the Democratic Party and its ideals. The organization also served as a resource to Democratic candidates nationally, educating them on issues of importance to the Jewish community. The NJDC served as a liberal watchdog on the lawful activities of the religious portion of the Right, acting to raise public awareness about efforts to undermine the wall between church and state. In 2007, its Annual Washington Conference attracted every major Democratic candidate for president, the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, and several party leaders, including Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. NJDC worked on the national level to help turn out Jewish voters in the 2004 elections, 2008 elections, and 2012 elections. NJDC also worked to send voter guides and direct mail to targeted Jewish households. In 2004, NJDC targeted 250,000 Jewish households in swing states with an intensive direct mail campaign. Demise Accumulating debts, a declining number of donors, outsourcing of functions, and a defamation lawsuit filed by Republican donor Sheldon Adelson against the NJDC (against which the group was ultimately successful) led to the organization's decline between about 2014 and 2016. It effectively disappeared from the political scene prior to the 2016 presidential election, and in legal pleadings, stated that it continued to exist only to pay its bills and because of the continuing litigation against Adelson. Some of its leadership campaigned for the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign under the Jews for Progress PAC banner. The group was replaced on a de facto basis in 2017 by the Jewish Democratic Council of America, which began its activities three months ahead of schedule because of President Donald Trump‚Äôs perceived equivocal response to the 2017 Charlottesville march and violence.  Mission  The National Jewish Democratic Council was founded in 1990 as the national voice of Jewish Democrats. Its stated priorities included:NJDC website * Educating Jewish voters about the differences between their Democratic and Republican candidates for elected office through special reports and voter guides. * Informing candidates for public office about the need to address and support issues of concern to the Jewish community. * Advocating on behalf of Jewish and Democratic ideals on Capitol Hill and in Jewish and national media. * Fighting the radical right agenda at every turn through research and reports, grass-roots advocacy, working directly with lawmakers in Washington, and educating journalists. * Engaging and cultivating a new generation of young Jewish Democratic leaders by replicating the Washington-based Young Leadership program in other major cities, including New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Cleveland, and South Florida. * Expanding Jewish awareness of critical legislative activity through quarterly and bi-weekly publications, as well as Breakfast Roundtables and Domestic Issues Forums featuring Congressional and executive branch leaders.  NJDC leadership  * Senator Ben Cardin, Honorary Chair * Senator Ron Wyden, Honorary Chair * Stephen Bittel, Vice-Chair, Miami, FL * Steve Rabinowitz, Vice-Chair, Washington, D. C. * Marc Winkelman, Vice Chair, Austin, TX * Sheldon Cohen, Secretary, Washington, D. C. * Sunita Leeds, Treasurer, Washington, D. C.  2008 election  In October 2008, the NJDC held a conference in Washington, D. C., at which then Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden was the keynote speaker. Other notable speakers included Al Franken and Governor Howard Dean. It was noted that \\"In 2008, the NJDC trained nearly 100 surrogates to speak around country, according to [executive director Ira] Forman, ran newspaper ad campaigns in pivotal swing states, sent 350,000 targeted pieces of mail to Jewish households, dropped 35,000 pieces of literature in key Jewish neighborhoods, and ran Internet and Google word search campaigns\\".http://washingtonjewishweek.com/main.asp?SectionID=4&SubSectionID;=4&ArticleID;=9650&TM;=38618.6 In an article written on November 9, 2008, it was mentioned that \\"American Jewish voters have once again overwhelmingly supported the Democratic presidential nominee\\", and that \\"with Obama's victory, we selected a candidate who shares the values of the vast majority of American Jews, including the separation of church and state, a strong U.S.-Israel relationship, and reproductive freedom\\".http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1108/15420.html During the final days of the 2008 presidential campaign, an article came out explaining that the \\"National Jewish Democratic Council is sending out more than 350,000 mailers to Jewish households in key swing states, re-asserting the Democratic nominees stance on a number of issues\\". This article includes many fliers put out by the NJDC in order to inform voters about Barack Obama and Joe Biden's positions on Israel. Marc Stanley, chairman of the NJDC, wrote an op-ed in the JTA entitled \\"Why Jews Voted for Obama\\". In the article, he gave two explanations: \\"First, Obama‚Äôs performance in the debates belied the GOP narrative that he could not be trusted, while McCain‚Äôs pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate undermined his Jewish support. Second, Jewish Democrats - the National Jewish Democratic Council, along with the Obama campaign and other independent efforts - were better organized than ever.\\"http://jta.org/news/article/2008/11/05/1000800/op-ed-why-jews-voted-for- obama In 2008, exit polls showed that Barack Obama received 78% of the Jewish vote.  Barack Obama presidency  The NJDC approved of the Obama administration's policies such as the 2009 stimulus package,http://www.njdc.org/media/entry/NJDC_praises_eco and the president's decision to pull out of Durban II,http://www.njdc.org/blog/post/ThankYouObamaDurban030309 the UN conference against racism which has been known to be a forum for anti-Israel agitation. The NJDC also declared its trust in Obama's support for Israel, and charged other organizations like the Republican Jewish Coalition of distorting information about Barack Obama and his support for Israel.

Since its establishment in 1987, the RSPN has promoted environmental education and advocacy, conservation and sustainable livelihoods, research and emerging issues like climate change, water and solid waste. The Society was registered under the Companies Act of Bhutan until last quarter of 2009 without proper authority which regulated the non-profit organization, with a special clause on non-profit entity. With the establishment of Civil Society Authority of Bhutan, the Society is now registered Civil Society Organization Authority as one of the Public Benefit Organizations under Bhutanese law. The RSPN celebrated its Silver Jubilee on 24 October 2012.  Activities  The RSPN is active in research and conservation of endangered species. RSPN has been working in Phobjika Valley, Wangdue Phodrang District, home to the endangered black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) for over two decades to conserve the black necked crane and at the same time to promote sustainable livelihoods of the people there. This valley contains wildlife corridors connecting Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park with other protected areas of Bhutan, however most of the area is not under official government protection. To meet the environmental and social needs, RSPN initiated projects to promote sustainable ecotourism, alternative energy, and gender and water, waste management, wetland conservation, organic farming, income generating options such as souvenir making and in the conservation of forest resources in close collaboration with the Department of Forest and Park Services.RSPN extended its program to Wamrong and Kangpara communities in Trashigang District and in Zhemgang District focused to community based natural resource management and sustainable livelihoods of the people. Under the Environmental Education and Advocacy Program, the RSPN is a collaboration with the Ministry of Education established school based nature club in all the schools across the country. Nature clubs are active in creating environmental awareness in the school and in communities around. To support nature club program, RSPN developed and distributed a nature club activity manual and nature club management guide books. Over 1,000 teachers were trained to manage nature club activities in schools. In consultation with the Royal University of Bhutan, the RSPN introduced environmental studies modules in the teacher training colleges of Samtse and Paro. RSPN also extended its environmental education program to the monastic schools. Environmental education materials were developed and monks and nuns were trained to conduct conservation activities.

Gale Literature Resource Center. Accessed 9 Mar. 2020. Cameron has described her family as \\"hard-working, dirt poor,\\" and highlights the peace and order she found in reading books as a child. She began writing at a young age, \\"scribbling notes on toilet paper,\\" and attended high school in Nanaimo, British Columbia. At fourteen her mother gifted her a typewriter \\"even though she could not afford it.\\" Cameron did not complete high school, and resisted certain subjects like home economics, preferring instead to spend time in the library. She has lived briefly in Ontario, and in the mainland Vancouver area, but has spent most of her life on Vancouver Island. She married and divorced, and parented 5 children, Alex Hubert, Erin Hubert, Pierre Hubert, Marianne Hubert Jones, and Tara Hubert Miller. Lacking the formal school credits to attend university, and later declined admission by Simon Fraser University as a mature student applicant, Cameron developed her writing through her own ingenuity and collaborative projects with friends. She especially credits time spent listening to storytellers; in particular she references Welsh coal-mining women and North English women storytellers, Chinese elder and Indigenous elder storytellers. Writing She includes details about the First Nations storytellers whose stories are reflected in her books in the foreword. She wrote for the Indian Voice in Vancouver (founded in 1969 by British Columbia Indian Homemakers' Association) and engaged her writing as a form of activism, winning a centennial play-writing contest for Windigo, a stage adaptation of a documentary poem about racism. One outcome of winning the contest was that the play toured the province and was performed by First Nations inmates in Matsqui Penitentiary, Abbortsford, British Columbia. This experience led her to co-found the Tillicurn Theatre in 1974, a First Nations theatre group formed locally that toured British Columbia and performed \\"dramatizations of legends and a theatre piece based on the death of Fred Quilt, a Chilcotin man who died of ruptured guts after an encounter with two RCMP on a back road at night.\\" In an interview with Alan Twigg, referring to this work, she explains that \\"It started out political. It has become very personal.\\" Among other jobs, she worked as a student psychiatric nurse (1955-57), as a medical assistant with the Royal Canadian Air Force (1957-59), an Instructor in creative writing at Malaspina College, Powell River, and writer in residence at Simon Fraser University, the institution that had declined her admission as a mature university student years earlier on the basis of insufficient high school credits. Some screenplays were written under her name at the time, Cam Hubert; Cameron later added novels and children's books to her body of work. Her bestselling Daughters of Copper Woman (1981), first printed by the Vancouver feminist collective Press Gang Publishers, is regarded as \\"a groundbreaking bestseller and women's studies staple\\" has been reprinted thirteen times. Writing an academic article about Cameron's work, Christine St. Peter contacted Press Gang Publishers and was told that \\"women from all over the world write to describe how reading Daughters of Copper Woman has changed their lives\\" (interview with Della McCreary, 20 July 1987; St. Peter, 1989, at page 500). Cameron's writing focuses on British Columbia First Nations lives, mainly in coastal communities such as Powell River and Nanaimo. Her characters explore spirituality, resilience, sexuality, resistance, and healing, and encounter violence, oppression, misogyny, and poverty. Many stories reflect specific Indigenous cultures and myths, and offer a critical feminist, anti-colonial narrative that cherishes creation stories and oral histories (e.g. Daughters of Copper Woman, based on Nootka myths and legends, and Dzelarhons: Myths of the Northwest Coast). The \\"destructive impact of white culture on the Indian population, particularly on the cultural position of women\\" is powerfully communicated in Daughters of Copper Woman (1981), alongside \\"women's strength, courage, sisterhood, and transmission of knowledge for survival [...] considered basic to the well-being of their society.\\" In an interview with Alan Twigg, owner and publisher of the newspaper, B.C. BookWorld, Cameron explained \\"We identify with British Columbia much more than we identify as Canadians\\" (1988 Interview by Alan Twigg). The royalties from her book sales have supported causes that center Indigenous and First Nations' priorities (2002 interview with author reproduced on BC Book Look). Cameron published 'A Short Story' in the 1981 'Lesbiantics' issue of Fireweed, a quarterly feminist publication, and has been recognised for foregrounding \\"the pleasure of women living together and the humour, for example, of a lesbian couple nailing the sign 'Women' over their outhouse\\" (p. 651 in the Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature, 2nd Ed.). Cameron has said of the characters in her stories, \\"Their being queer is not why they are in my stories.

The degree and method of infrastructure sharing can vary in each country depending on regulatory and competitive climate.  Regulatory view  =United States= The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as an independent agency of the United States government, was established by the Communications Act of 1934. As the successor to the Federal Radio Commission, FCC took charge of regulating all non-federal government use of the radio spectrum (including radio and television broadcasts), all interstate telecommunications (broadband, wireless and satellite), and all international communications originating or terminating in the United States. In 1996, The U.S. Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which was later recognised as a watershed moment for the competitiveness of the US telecommunications industry. By deregulating infrastructure, it introduced competition into the market. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 put incumbent telecommunications carriers under the following obligations:The Telecommunications Act of 1996, ‚Äú‚Äù * Access to rights of way‚Äîthe duty to afford access to the poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way of such carrier to competing providers of telecommunications. (Section 251 (b)) * Reciprocal compensation‚Äîthe duty to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the transport and termination of telecommunications. (Section 251(b)) Local Exchange Carriers are further obligated as follows: * Interconnection‚Äîthe duty to provide, for the facilities or equipment of any requesting telecommunications carrier, interconnection with the local exchange carrier's network. (Section 251 (c)) By the stipulations in the Act, new entrants in the market are able to lease network infrastructure that was built or is being used by their competitors. =United Kingdom= The UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom, states that it \\"encourages mobile network operators to share masts and/or sites where possible\\" and the Mobile Operators Association (MOA) has published a paper on the subject. There is some co-operation between networks. Mobile Broadband Network Limited (MBNL) is a joint venture between 3UK and T-Mobile (now EE), and O2 and Vodafone have established a joint team called Cornerstone. The two schemes are different in that MBNL shares antennas and some network equipment while Cornerstone shares the cell sites but not any of the broadcasting equipment. =France= The three largest French mobile network operators (Orange, Bouygues Telecom and SFR) have since 2008 been legally required by the French government and the French telecommunications regulator ARCEP to provide shared 2G GSM and 3G UMTS coverage in rural dead zones (zone blanche in French) under the name \\"F-CONTACT\\" which, although made up of separate towers and radio access networks hosted by each of the three aforementioned operators, must legally allow their mobile signals to be shared with both postpaid and prepaid subscribers of each of said three operators. MVNOs which are hosted on either the Orange, Bouygues or SFR networks are also usually allowed to roam on each host network's F-CONTACT masts (only on 2G), although some outright choose not to do so for cost reasons. The fourth and newest French mobile network operator Free Mobile has since its commercial launch in January 2012 until the end of 2020 also allow domestic roaming on the Orange mobile network in 2G and 3G (including F-CONTACT masts hosted by Orange) in areas where Free Mobile does not have native coverage, while Free Mobile continues to build up its own mobile network. In 2015, the French government announced a plan to upgrade all 268 municipalities in France with neither mobile phone nor mobile internet coverage to at least 3G by the end of 2016, while over 2000 municipalities with only 2G coverage were to be upgraded to 3G by mid-2017, both of which represented a major expansion of F-CONTACT.http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomshardware.fr%2Farticles%2Fcouverture- france-2g-telephone-edge%2C1-56074.html  Advantages  Infrastructure sharing limits duplication and gears investment toward underserved areas, product innovation, and improved customer service. Traditionally, telecommunication development shows economy of scale and telecom operator spending has been dominated by considerable investment of technology and infrastructure. Given that such investments are fixed, sunk and irreversible, they represent a high risk factor. Maintaining and upgrading infrastructure make this risk even higher. For example, fixed network operators are migrating to next-generation networks, after most mobile network operators have already deployed the third-generation(3G) infrastructures. Therefore, infrastructure sharing can significantly reduce entrance and development risk. Infrastructure sharing also has great impact on competition. Market becomes more attractive to new players for decreased entrance barriers. Such players can enrich the competition while investing effectively. By alleviating pressure of network deployment, sharing allows operators to turn their attention to improved innovation, better customer service and eventually better commercial offerings and healthier competition.Telecom Infrastructure Sharing(Regulatory Enablers and Economic Benefites),, 2007.  Telecom infrastructure  Basically a cell site consists of electronic (active) and non-electronic infrastructure.  Infrastructure sharing  Utility pole shared by service providers Telecom service providers can share infrastructure in many ways, depending on telecom regulatory and legislation. *Passive infrastructure sharing is sharing non- electronic infrastructure at cell site. Passive Infrastructure is becoming popular in telecom industry worldwide. **Site sharing includes antennas and mast; this may also hold Base transceiver station (BTS), Node B in UMTS context and common equipment such as Antenna system, masts, cables, ducts, filters, power source and shelter. **Sharing a mast is called mast sharing. **Antenna sharing shares an antenna and all related connections (coupler, feeder cable), in addition to passive radio site elements. *Active sharing is sharing electronic infrastructure. *Spectrum-sharing (also called Frequency sharing) concept is based on a lease model and is often termed ‚Äòspectrum trading‚Äô. An operator can lease a part of its spectrum to another operator on commercial terms. Though this mechanism, along with that of MVNOs, exists in the US, Europe, Singapore and Australia. *Base station sharing is prospective while each operator maintains control over logical Node B so that it will be able to operate the frequencies assigned to the carrier, fully independent from the partner operator and retains control over active base station equipment such as the TRXs that control reception/transmission over radio channels. Radio network controller and core network are not shared here. *Radio Network Controller (RNC) sharing represents maintaining logical control over the RNC of each operator independently. *MSC and routers sharing or backbone sharing includes sharing switches (MSC) and routers (SGSN) on the operator's fixed network. *Network sharing where a network infrastructure is created expressly for the purpose of sharing resources. For example, in Sweden 70% of the country is covered by a shared network built as a joint venture between Telenor Sweden (originally Vodafone Sweden) and HI3G (Hutcheson Investor). When a user is in one of the main cities his calls are carried by the native network infrastructure of Telenor or HI3G while outside the cities his call roams onto the shared network provided by 3GIS.3GIS web site (in Swedish) *Geographical splitting  See also  * Unbundled access  References   External links  * Site Share * TRAI proposes sharing of telecom infrastructure ‚Äì The Hindu, April 12, 2007 Category:Telecommunications infrastructure ","title":"Telecom infrastructure sharing"},{"id":"11877924","text":"The giant snipe (Gallinago undulata) is a stocky wader. It breeds in South America. The nominate subspecies G. u. undulata occurs in two distinct areas, one in Colombia, and the other from Venezuela through Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana to extreme north-eastern Brazil. The southern subspecies G. u. gigantea is found in eastern Bolivia, eastern Paraguay and south-east Brazil, and probably also in Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina. It occurs in tall vegetation in swamps and flooded grasslands, and occasionally in dry savannah. It ranges from the lowlands up to 2,200 m altitude. It seems to arrive in some areas after rain, but its seasonal movements are very poorly understood. Taxonomy The giant snipe was described by the French polymath Georges- Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Scolopax undulata in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The giant snipe is now placed in the genus Gallinago that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The generic name is New Latin for a woodcock or snipe from Latin gallina, \\"hen\\" and the suffix -ago, \\"resembling\\". The specific epithet undulatus is Latin for \\"with wave-like markings\\". Two subspecies are recognised: * G. u. undulata (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, north Brazil * G. u. gigantea (Temminck, 1826) ‚Äì east Bolivia to Paraguay, southeast Brazil and northeast Argentina Description This is the largest snipe at 40‚Äì43.5 cm in length. G. u. gigantea, as its name suggests, is larger than the nominate subspecies with little overlap in size; for example, its bill length is usually more than 12.0 cm, whereas G. u. undulata is usually less than 11.5 cm. The giant snipe has a stocky body and relatively short legs for a wader. It has broad rounded wings like a woodcock and a very long bill. Its upperparts, head and neck are streaked and patterned with black and brown, and chestnut edges to the feathers form distinct lines down its back. The belly is white with brown barring on the flanks. The flight feathers are barred, a feature unique to this snipe. The horn-coloured bill is very long and straight. The legs and feet are greyish-green. No plumage differences related to age or sex are known, but in other snipe the sexes are similar and immature birds differ only in showing pale fringes on the wing coverts. The giant snipe has a kek-kek call when flushed, and a rasping trisyllabic call is given in its nocturnal display flight. Giant snipe can be distinguished from the sympatric common and the Magellan snipe by its huge size and rounded wings. The other large species, Andean, Fuegian and imperial snipe, are upland species which lack the well-defined upperpart markings and white belly shown by giant snipe. The noble snipe is more similar to giant, but obviously smaller-bodied. Behaviour Nests of the southern race have been found in Brazil in September and from November to early January. They are placed on a hillock between swamps, and 2‚Äì4 eggs are laid. No nests of the nominate subspecies have been found. This species is rarely seen on the ground, and its habitat, reluctance to flush until almost trodden on, cryptic plumage, and nocturnal feeding mean its habits are almost unknown. Its diet apparently includes frogs. The giant snipe is usually seen alone when flushed. Other Gallinago snipes have an aerial display, which involves flying high in circles, followed by a powerful stoop during which the bird makes a drumming sound, caused by vibrations of modified outer tail feathers. This species displays at night, but it is not known whether it drums. Status The giant snipe is hunted through most of its range, its large size making it easier to shoot than other snipes. Habitat loss is also a threat, at least in part of its range. It is nowhere common, and is local and uncommon in Colombia and Venezuela, but its nocturnal habits and extremely secretive behaviour might exaggerate its apparent scarcity, and it is currently not thought to be threatened.

The pudding cake is palm size and is sweet in taste. It is soft, but can hold its molded shape outside a bowl. The cake is made from white or brown sugar, long-grain rice flour with a little wheat starch or cornstarch. Sometimes red beans are also added. The batter is poured into porcelain bowls and steamed until cooked through. Then it is let cooled and served at room temperature. Traditionally, the hawker inserts two bamboo skewers into the cake to turn it out and the eater holds the skewers to consume. At present, most Put Chai Ko are sold in plastic bags. Names The snack is also known by a number of English names, including Put chai pudding, Earthen bowl cake, Bootjaigo, ‚ÄîRed bean pudding or Put chai ko., boots chai go History The pudding is made like other traditional Cantonese steamed cakes. It is said to have originated in the Chinese county of Taishan, which is west of Hong Kong. The pudding reached its popularity peak in the early to mid-1980s when hawkers sold it all over the streets in their push carts. At the time, there were only a small handful of flavors. One of the dish's cultural trademarks is that it is served in a porcelain bowl or an aluminium cup. The snack is still available today in select Chinese pastry or snack shops, or from street hawkers.

Although often abbreviated DMF, it should not be confused with dimethylformamide. A derivative of furan, this simple compound is a potential biofuel, being derivable from cellulose. Production Fructose can be converted into 2,5-dimethylfuran in a catalytic biomass-to-liquid process. The conversion of fructose to DMF proceeds via hydroxymethylfurfural. Fructose is obtainable from glucose, a building block in cellulose. Potential as a biofuel DMF has a number of attractions as a biofuel. It has an energy density 40% greater than that of ethanol, making it comparable to gasoline (petrol). It is also chemically stable and, being insoluble in water, does not absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Evaporating dimethylfuran during the production process also requires around one third less energy than the evaporation of ethanol, although it has a boiling point some 14 ¬∞C higher, at 92 ¬∞C, compared to 78 ¬∞C for ethanol. The ability to efficiently and rapidly produce dimethylfuran from fructose, found in fruit and some root vegetables, or from glucose, which can be derived from starch and cellulose - all widely available in nature - adds to the attraction of dimethylfuran, although safety issues must be examined. Bioethanol and biodiesel are currently the leading liquid biofuels. The stoichiometric air/fuel ratio of dimethylfuran is 10.72, compared to ethanol at 8.95 and gasoline at 14.56. This means that burning dimethylfuran requires approximately 33% less air than the same quantity of gasoline, but approximately 20% more air than the same quantity of ethanol. The calorific value of liquid dimethylfuran is 33.7 MJ/kg, compared to 26.9 MJ/kg for ethanol and 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline. The research octane number (RON) of dimethylfuran is 119. The latent heat of vaporization at 20 ¬∞C is 31.91 kJ/mol. Recent tests in a single-cylinder gasoline engine found that the thermal efficiency of burning dimethylfuran is similar to that of gasoline. Other uses 2,5-Dimethylfuran serves as a scavenger for singlet oxygen, a property which has been exploited for the determination of singlet oxygen in natural waters. The mechanism involves a Diels-Alder reaction followed by hydrolysis, ultimately leading to diacetylethylene and hydrogen peroxide as products. More recently, furfuryl alcohol has been used for the same purpose.Patrick L. Brezonik. Chemical Kinetics and Process Dynamics in Aquatic Systems. CRC Press, 1994, p. 671. 750px 2,5-Dimethylfuran has also been proposed as an internal standard for NMR spectroscopy. 2,5-Dimethylfuran has singlets in its 1H NMR spectrum at Œ¥ 2.2 and 5.8; the singlets give reliable integrations, while the positions of the peaks do not interfere with many analytes. The compound also has an appropriate boiling point of 92 ¬∞C which prevents evaporative losses, yet is easily removed. Role in food chemistry 2,5-Dimethylfuran forms upon thermal degradation of some sugars and has been identified in trace amounts as a component of caramelized sugars. Toxicology 2,5-Dimethylfuran plays a role in the mechanism for the neurotoxicity of hexane in humans. Together with hexane-2,5-dione and 4,5-dihydroxy-2-hexanone, it is one of the main metabolites of hexane.Peter Arlien-S√∏borg. Solvent Neurotoxicity. CRC Press, 1992. . 2,5-Dimethylfuran has been identified as one of the components of cigar smoke with low ciliary toxicity (ability to adversely affect the cilia in the respiratory tract that are responsible for removing foreign particles).Donald Shopland. Cigars: Health Effects and Trends. DIANE Publishing, 1998. Its blood concentration can be used as a biomarker for smoking. Comparison of Safety Data Sheets shows that human handling of 2,5-dimethylfuran is approximately as hazardous as handling gasoline.

Biography La Chapelle travelled to Spain and Portugal and wrote The Modern Cook while in Chesterfield's employment (a French edition was published in 1735). An Eighteenth-century classic of the culinary arts, it exercised a strong influence on aristocratic cuisine in England. To some degree, La Chapelle borrowed some of his recipes from his predecessor Fran√ßois Massialot, who composed a book on court cookery and confectionery in 1692. La Chapelle was the first writer to insist on a rupture with the past and to characterise his cooking as modern. While working in London, La Chapelle published his text first in three English volumes in 1733 and then in four French volumes in 1735. Entitled Le Cuisinier moderne, the work was the forerunner of a lavishly illustrated series of cookbooks that might equally well be considered art books. Philip & Mary Hyman, Printing the Kitchen in Food: A Culinary History, p. 398. In 1742 he published Le cuisinier moderne, qui apprend √† donner toutes sortes de repas, en gras & en maigre, d'une mani√®re plus d√©licate que ce qui en a √©t√© √©crit jusqu'√† pr√©sent : divis√© en cinq volumes, avec de nouveaux mod√©les de vaisselle, & des desseins de table dans le grand go√ªt d'aujourd'hui, gravez en taille-douce ... / par le sieur Vincent La Chapelle in The Hague. The cookbook has some prints of table settings and is easy to read; not very much has changed since. Many recipes are based on typical Dutch or English dishes, like steak and pies. He used many herbs or expensive oysters, some recipes are low fat, considered with his clientele; some are accompanied with rice, then he called it Indian. La Chapelle formed a Freemason lodge on 8 November 1734, probably in The Hague or Leeuwarden. There is still a lodge in the Netherlands carrying his name. After the Prince of Orange married Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange in London, he returned to the Netherlands with the cook Vincent la Chapelle. It is very possible they knew each other for some years, since Vincent was the cook of the English ambassador. It has recently been shown that the Saxon minister Heinrich, Graf von Bruhl, had a chef d'office who also had the surname La Chapelle, and the two made regular visits to the Meissen factory between 1737 and 1740‚Äîduring the period when the radically inventive Swan service was in production. If the two La Chapelles are one and the same, which remains unknown, it would shed light on the close relationship between pastry and sugar sculpture, and silver and porcelain modelling.

More information about hours and services can be found on Tozzer Library‚Äôs homepage. History 350x350px Tozzer Library is the oldest library in the United States specializing in all subfields of anthropology, ethnology, and archaeology. Originally founded as the library of Harvard University‚Äôs Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the Library was first recognized as the Peabody Museum Library. The Museum was established in 1866 after George Peabody gifted $150,000 towards the acquisition and preservation of archaeological artifacts, as well as towards a physical building and professorship support. The Library was established a few years later, as the Museum‚Äôs collections rapidly expanded. The very first book (Kaladlit okalluktualliait: kal√¢dlisut kablun√¢tudlo) added to the Library was recorded in 1868 by Jeffries Wyman (1814-1874), natural scientist and Peabody Museum‚Äôs first curator. Since the Library was established as an appendage to the Peabody Museum, the book budget and collection grew relatively slowly in its early seminal years, and there were no full-time staff (Schmidt 1982Nancy J. Schmidt, ‚ÄúA Short History of Anthropology Headings at Tozzer Library,‚Äù History of Anthropology Newsletter 9, 1: 11-14 (1982).). Books purchases were rare, and scholars were accustomed to depending on the collections of other libraries‚Äô within Harvard (Weeks 1987John M. Weeks, ‚ÄúTozzer Library: A ‚ÄòNational‚Äô Library for Anthropology in the United States,‚Äù Current Anthropology 28, 1: 133-137 (1987).). In 1880, the collection had reached approximately 1,000 volumes, most of which had been donated. Annual Reports during the first couple decades of the Library‚Äôs history indicate an average annual expenditure of roughly $50. Wyman and his secretary, Jane Smith, used index cards to alphabetically catalogue the small collection (Currier 1949Margaret Currier, ‚ÄúThe Peabody Museum Library,‚Äù Harvard Library Bulletin 3: 94-101 (1949).). alt=Photograph of F.W. Putnam in the Peabody MuseumBy the turn of the nineteenth century, the Peabody Museum‚Äôs growing collections and scholarly publications had broadened in scope within the field and opened up opportunities for exchanges and gifts. Harvard archaeologist Charles P. Bowditch (1842-1921) was the largest contributor to the Peabody Museum during this period. He initiated many expeditions to Central America to study the Maya civilization and donated a substantial number of materials to the Peabody Museum and Library (Tozzer 1921Alfred M. Tozzer, ‚ÄúCharles Pickering Bowditch,‚Äù American Anthropologist 23, 3: 353-359 (1921).). One notable example that Tozzer Library owns is the Bowditch-Gates Collection, which includes over 250 photographic reproductions of nearly every known unpublished manuscript and imprint in Mayan and Mexican languages. In addition to expeditions, Bowditch paved the way for a professorship, as well as continued research and publications under the Peabody Museum. In 1891, Frederic Ward Putnam (1839-1915), Peabody‚Äôs first professor, led the first course in archaeology and ethnography of the US (Currier 1949). In 1904, Harvard anthropology professor Roland B. Dixon (1875-1934) was appointed as the first librarian of the Peabody Museum Library (Schmidt 1982). The administrative accomplishments of Dixon, along with the wider scope of research and expeditions and expanding student body, led to substantial growth of the Peabody Museum and Library during the early twentieth century. Archaeological research of Central America and the American Southwest continued, and scholars also expanded their focus to areas of Africa and Asia. Publications grew in numbers and scope, resulting in wider recognition of the Peabody Museum and Library as leading players in the field and opening additional opportunities for research exchanges. Dixon was able to secure increased funding for collection development, new shelving, and a team of staff. He also created an index as part of the Library‚Äôs card catalogue and developed a system of anthropological separate subject headings, boosting the Library‚Äôs reputation as a specialized academic library. Dixon‚Äôs card cataloguing and separate subject headings were used for many years, although they were revised and updated as anthropological terminology evolved throughout the years (Weeks 1987). 275x275px Dixon served as Librarian until his death in 1934 and was succeeded by Alfred M. Tozzer (1877-1954), Hudson Professor of Archaeology of Harvard University (Tozzer & Kroeber 1936Alfred M. Tozzer and Alfred L. Kroeber, ‚ÄúRoland Burrage Dixon,‚Äù American Anthropologist 38, 2 (1936).). Tozzer continued in Dixon‚Äôs footsteps, growing the Library‚Äôs collections and using the cataloguing system that Dixon developed (Weeks 1987). Earlier in his career, Tozzer participated in several excavations to study the Maya civilization. He was part of a Peabody Museum-funded excavation team that was credited with discovering the Holmul ruins in 1910 (Tozzer 1913Alfred M. Tozzer, ‚ÄúA Preliminary Study of the Prehistoric Ruins of Nakum, Guatemala: A Report of the Peabody Museum Expedition, 1909-1910,‚Äù Memoirs of the Peabody Museum 5, 3: 144-201 (1913).). Tozzer donated many of his field notes to the Library and contributed to cultivating its collections on Mesoamerica (Weeks 1987). Architect‚Äôs rendering of the Tozzer Library building After Tozzer‚Äôs retirement in 1947, Margaret Currier was appointed as the third Librarian but the first professional librarian to lead the Peabody Museum Library. By this time, the Library‚Äôs collections had exceeded its physical location within the Museum, and plans were soon drafted for a building of its own. With the help of donations from the Tozzer family, among others, the new building underwent construction in 1973. The collections were moved to the newly renovated building in 1974, and the Peabody Museum Library was subsequently renamed to Tozzer Library, in honor of Alfred Tozzer (Weeks 1987). Antonio Rodriguez-Buckingham served briefly as the fourth Librarian, from 1974-1977, and was then followed by Nancy J. Schmidt, professional librarian and educational anthropologist, from 1977 to 1984. From the conception of the Library until then, the Peabody Museum had been largely responsible for funding the Library‚Äôs collection development and staff appointments. In 1979, however, Tozzer Library transitioned from the property of the Museum to Harvard College Library (HCL). This reorganization aligned library services and practices with those of HCL at large (Weeks 1987). Tozzer Library and the Peabody Museum remained closely connected and are still connected to this day. In the early 1980s, Tozzer Library began entering bibliographic records into HOLLIS, Harvard‚Äôs online library catalog, and in 1986, the Library completed the transition from card catalog to HOLLIS. The separate subject cataloguing system, originally devised by Roland B. Dixon, was also switched over to the widely used Library of Congress Subject Headings. Although the Library of Congress Subject Headings are now used widely throughout the field of anthropology, Dixon‚Äôs original index is still a major resource for research in anthropology, as it represents over a century of publishing in anthropology and is still produced at Harvard. Because Dixon had begun indexing journals retrospectively, all the way to the conception of the field of anthropology, the Library‚Äôs index has and continues to be one of the most comprehensive indexes of anthropology (Steins 2005Janet L. Steins, ‚ÄúAnthropology Libraries,‚Äù Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science 2: 53-63 (2005).). There is now an online database, Anthropological Literature (AL), for which users can explore citations to both print and digital journals. The 1980s saw the turnover of a few different librarians: Sally Williams served as Acting Librarian from 1984-1985, followed by G. Edward Evans from 1985-1988, and then Lynne M. Schmelz, who was originally appointed in 1988. Schmelz served on and off through 2018, with the exceptions of Maija M. Lutz (Librarian from 1998-2004) and Janet L. Steins (Interim Librarian from 2009-2010). After Schmelz retired from Harvard in 2018, Susan L. Gilman became and is still the Librarian of Tozzer Library.

It was designed by Andrew Johnston and built from 1809 to 1823. It is now part of the Uniting Church in Australia, having been a Presbyterian church prior to amalgamation. The church was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Ebenezer Uniting Church is Australia's oldest remaining church. It was the first Presbyterian church in the colony and is the nation's oldest functioning church. Worship began on the site as early as 1803, when 15 families, under the leadership of Pastor James Mein, met beneath the tree which still stands adjacent to the church today. The Covenanted Membership of the Church which was formed in 1806, was made up of people of Methodist, Anglican and Catholic backgrounds with a core group of Coromandelers. A church which doubled as a school and chapel was built in 1809. The first burial occurred in 1812 and a cemetery was established in the churchyard. The schoolmaster's residence is believed to have been constructed in 1817. Ebenezer Church was the first and for many years the only church built and paid for by voluntary gifts and labour. It was formally established as a church of the Presbyterian Order in 1824.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 6 The first ordained Minister to serve at Ebenezer was Dr John McGarvie, who was brought out to Sydney by the Rev. John Dunmore Lang in 1826 for this purpose. When Lang went overseas in 1830, McGarvie went back to Sydney to officiate at the Scots Church in Jamison Street and assist in the associated college.Crosson, 2012, 27 The school at Ebenezer was opened in 1810 under the headmastership of John Youl, a layman of the Anglican Church. It operated out of the church until the 1880s when a public school was built. When this burned down shortly afterwards, the school returned to the church until the present public school opened in 1902.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 7 In 1959 the church was extensively repaired and a vestry was built nearby. In 1985, a Heritage Council grant assisted the restoration of the Church, Vestry and Schoolmaster's Residence.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 11 The pioneer families who worshipped at the Church were a vital part of the development of the Hawkesbury as the food bowl for the colony. Most of them supported Governor Bligh at the time of the Rum Rebellion. They made a significant contribution to commerce and government administration. Shipbuilding was a major enterprise of a number of local families.  Description  270px Ebenezer Church is located on a prominent ridge overlooking the Hawkesbury River. =Church= The church building is a very simple, unadorned structure, drawn from the vernacular architecture of its Scottish Presbyterian builders. Heavy stone blockwork walls and gables were used with a pitched slate roof. A porch of comparable size and texture was added in 1926.The 18 pane windows are double- hung.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 14 The church was originally built with two additional doors set into the side walls. These were filled in shortly after construction and the doors, step and path are still visible as a change in the block work and coursing.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 16 The church was converted to its present form sometime after the construction of the school. There is some physical evidence of a temporary mezzanine level built before the church was commissioned by the Department of Education in 1887. During the late nineteenth century, guttering and rain water tanks were added. The church was repaired and ventilation slats were added when the vestry was built in 1959. =Church yard and grave yard= Sloping site with graves broadly west of the building complex, with some paved forecourt area from the street in to the church flanking the graveyard's northern edge. The eastern slope running down to the Hawkesbury River. This eastern slope of the church yard is predominantly grassed or grassland with some scattered remnant native Cumberland Plain Woodland trees. =Schoolmaster's residence= The schoolmaster's residence is of the same heavy construction as the church but has an unusual jerkinhead roof and raised stone window surrounds. A similar roof appears in the house of local Scottish settler John Turnbull. The windows are of the more common twelve pane variety. The annex on the northern side conceals elements of the original smaller annex, presumably built at the same time as the schoolhouse proper. This original annex was approximately 2.5m wide and ran from the living room door to the western corner of the schoolhouse. The east and west elevations were clad in vertical slab, while the north face appears to have been a rough weatherboarding. The annex was extended and clad with A/C panels some time this century.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 18 The remains of the original pergola and grape vine that extended to the living area door and smaller kitchen annex still exist. =Vestry= The vestry, added in 1959, is sympathetic to the scale and texture of the original buildings. = Modifications and dates = * pre-1879 - schoolhouse roofing replaced with corrugated iron. * 1887 - guttering and rain water tank added to church. Possible mezzanine level added to church interior. * 1926 - Church porch and role of honour added. * 1959 - Vestry and covered way added, designed by Morton Herman. Ventilation slats added to church. All buildings repointed with a raised cement mortar.  Heritage listing  Ebenezer Church is the oldest church in Australia. It is the first Presbyterian church and the oldest church still in use today. It has a unique place in the heritage of the Christian faith and the pioneer farming of the nation. The Church is an active congregation with a living history. Many of the families are descendants of the original Coromandel settlers. The cemetery is one of the most important in Australia. It has an association with six generations of Coromandel settlers. The original structures display a high degree of technical competence. The simplicity and sturdiness of the buildings, particularly the church, can be seen as a manifestation of the way of life, taste and customs of the early Scottish Presbyterian settlers. Ebenezer Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Ebenezer Church is the oldest extant church in Australia. It is the first Presbyterian church and the oldest church still in use today. Ebenezer represents the establishment of the Presbyterian Church in Australia.Cox and Corkhill 1985: 3 Ebenezer has also established links with the development and politics of the early colony. The Protestant work ethic of the pioneers made a major contribution to shaping the Australian ethos. The cemetery is one of the most important in Australia. It has an association with six generations of Coromandel settlers, who were some of the first free settlers in the colony.Cox and Corkhill 1985:14 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The original structures display a high degree of technical competence. The simplicity and sturdiness of the buildings, particularly the church, can be seen as a manifestation of the way of life, taste and customs of the early Scottish Presbyterian settlers, while preserving the autonomy of the schoolmaster's house. The structures are also enhanced by their backdrop of eucalyptus, open grassland and the river. The visual and physical relationship with the river is important in maintaining the identity of the church group. The setting gives a good idea of the conditions the original settlers found. The river is also significant in its function of carrying funeral processions to the site.Cox and Corkhill 1985:13 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

History One of the earliest puzzle contests was held about 1910. The publisher of the New York Herald offered a $5 gold piece to the reader who could form the most words using the letters from the shortest verse in the Bible. More than 400 readers submitted identical solutions listing 2505 words, and the publisher was obliged to pay $5 to each of them, since no provision had been made for ties. Puzzle contests started to gain widespread popularity in the 1920s, and in 1927 the tabloid newspaper the New York Evening Graphic offered $50,000 in a contest. By the 1940s and 1950s millions of players tried to solve puzzles published in a wide range of newspapers and magazines. The first puzzle contests in that era were designed primarily to boost the circulation of the magazine or newspaper. These contests were usually free to play. The most popular contest of this era was the Tangle Towns contest. Shortly after the New York Herald Tribune started publishing Tangle Towns in September 1954, the number of readers went up 72,000 to over 400,000. It was believed the puzzle was directly responsible for this increase. These contests ran in newspapers in major cities. In this contest the names of local cities would be scrambled, such as WONKERY for NEW YORK. The player had to unscramble the name. As the contest progressed, two city names, and then three city names would all be scrambled together. The final tiebreaker would consist of several hundred letters from which the player would have to form 20 or 25 city names, with various scores assigned to different letters and letter combinations. The largest prize ever paid in a puzzle contest is still the $190,000 prize offered in a 1947 contest sponsored by Unicorn Press. The final puzzle consisted of several dozen pictures which had to be identified. Then the resulting words had to be anagrammed in the style of a Word Rebus, with points added for each word used, and points deducted for individual letters that were included in the rebus. The puzzle was designed by William Sunners, a Brooklyn schoolteacher for a fee of $15,000 (roughly 4 years salary in that era). In the 1950s the focus of puzzle contests became fund-raising. Organizations such as the Boy Scouts and the Salvation Army would advertise their contests in large-circulation magazines. These contests either had an entry fee to play, or required a donation to the sponsoring organization. The most popular format for these contests was a picture composed of digits. The player had to correctly add all of the digits. The final tiebreaker would require the player to draw a path through a grid of several hundred numbers to obtain the highest possible total. Modern era The current era of puzzle contests, in which the contests are conducted almost entirely by mail, began in the early 1970s. A promoter of packaged vacation tours called American Holiday Association (AHA) decided to use a puzzle contest to publicize its holiday packages. The puzzle contest proved so popular, that eventually AHA dropped its vacation business and became exclusively a puzzle contest promoter. The best-known of the AHA contests was their BINGO format word grid. In the first round the player had to fill in 5 words into the 5x5 grid, meshing with the word BINGO that had already been filled into the left column. Since there were only 2 words in the word list starting with B, only 2 words with I, etc., no real skill was required. The second round was similar, with BINGO filled in the diagonal. Again, there were only 2 words starting with B, only 2 words with I in the second position, and so forth. At their peak, around 1985-90, the AHA contests drew about 100,000 players in each contest, with a new contest starting every week. The Diamond Dilemma was a 160-piece 3d triangular tiling puzzle with a ¬£250,000 prize for a full solution. The prize went unclaimed by the 1990 deadline, though prizes for easier subproblems were awarded. The Eternity puzzle (1999) and Eternity II puzzle (2007) were a 209-piece tiling and a 256-piece edge-matching puzzle developed by Christopher Monckton, for which a ¬£1 million and $2 million prize could be won. The first competition was won by a pair of mathematicians, the second went unsolved.

In 1940, when she was thirteen years old, she won the contest in a local radio station, Los aficionados de WPAB, an amateur show for performers. That led to other radio shows in musical programs, such as Variedades musicales and also acting parts in soap operas and Cosas de amor, among other programs broadcast through WPAB. In 1944, she became the lead female vocalist of the local Ponce orchestra Mingo & His Whoopie Kids and toured the Island. In 1946, for several months, she was also the lead singer for the orquestra of Abd√≠as Villalonga and toured the Island again. Romero arrived in San Juan in 1950 and performed with a group composed, mostly, by young musicians, Los Bohemios. In 1953 she was a vocalist in the Combo de Sylvia Rexach. That same year she began her night club appearances, initially at the Vodoo Room of the Normandy Hotel as lead singer of the Joe Vallejo Combo. On radio, she became a regular singer in Revista informal\\" and recorded her first single in 1954 for the Puerto Rican recording company, Marvela. Career =Television= Her debut on television was on 1954, shortly after the outset of television in Puerto Rico. As a singer, she sang in variety shows, such as Fiesta a las 9, Fandango Rheingold and Caravana, aired through the two tv stations at the time, WKAQ and WAPA. She got her first tv acting break in 1955 appearing in many of the tv dramas presented by Channel 2 (WKAQ), such as Domingo de amor Palmolive and Teleteatro Hunts, among others. She was also recruited for minor roles in two of the very first tv soap operas, Cautivo de amor and Tormenta de rosa. In 1956, she played Angustias in the successful Cuando los hijos condenan, a milestone soap opera that led to a complete change in the length of the genre. Also in 1956, she became a regular member of the cast of the variety show La taberna India, a program that became the most popular show at time and the breakthrough for Cortijo y su combo, the most popular band of Puerto Rico during the 1950s. In 1957, she was the star, along with Gilbero Monroig, of Show Palmolive and in 1959 of Show Carnation, broadcast by Channel 2 and Channel 4, respectively. After supporting roles in soap operas, such as Sangre en la calle, Divorcio and Yo mat√© a una santa, Romero got top billing in Rafael Heredia: Gitano, opposite Esther Sandoval and Argentinian actor Enzo Bellomo. Other telenovelas in which she participated during the 1960s were Milagro de amor (1961), opposite Braulio Castillo, Nuestros hijos (1962),La sombra del otro(1963),Entre tu amor y mi fe\\" (1963), Busquen a esta mujer (1967) \\"Entre el pu√±al y la cruz. Her most successful soap opera during the 1960s was La divina infiel (1961), where she played a singer estranged from her two daughters by a jealous husband. The soap opera was so popular that they made a theater adaption that toured the whole Island. In 1977, she made her last appearance in a telenovela, performing in Pueblo Chico (Small Town). =Theater= On 19 May 1960, Romero made her official onstage debut with the play En el Principio la noche era serena (At the Beginning the Night was Serene), written by Gerard Paul Mar√≠n, and performed at San Juan's Municipal Teatro Tapia.

Lyrics The title, which is an Australian term for a munitions factory,The Dead Heart Midnight Oil FAQ, retrieved 21-06-07. can be seen as a way to describe the band's sound; fast and explosive, clearly a more-than-accurate description of this song, particularly in live performances. Powderworks is also the name of a record label, which the group established in 1978. The song is one of the band's earliest lyrical protests, targeting lying politicians and is narrated by someone who has dealt with enough of the politicians' nonsense.  Reception  Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the album, \\"Only a handful of tracks such as 'Powderworks', 'Used and Abused' and the single 'Run by Night' (December 1978) revealed any promise.\\" \\"Powderworks\\" was not released as a single, and despite this is regarded rather highly by fans of the band and early on, became a very important part of the band's live performances. Unlike other songs from the album - \\"Used and Abused,\\" \\"Surfing with a Spoon,\\" and \\"Run by Night\\" - which were often performed live in the band's early touring, which was a place chosen to road-test the songs from Head Injuries, such as \\"No Reaction\\" and \\"Koala Sprint,\\" this song persevered and was played in live shows up until at least 1982. Live versions Currently, only one official live version has been released; this version is available on both Saturday Evening at the Capitol and Scream in Blue. This version omits the third verse and is considerably faster-moving than the original studio version. The song may have appeared on the chocolate wheel for the Redneck Wonderland tour, as did other tracks from this album. Compilations While this song was popular with fans, it appeared on neither of the band's two compilations, 20,000 Watt R.S.L. or Flat Chat. It did appear on The Green Disc, however.

History of Tamil Nadu politics  = Formation of Tamil Nadu = The region of Tamil Nadu indicates historical records of human habitation at least for 3,800 years. The current state of Tamil Nadu was formed by renaming Madras State on 14 January 1969. = Pre-Dravidian politics of Tamil Nadu = The era of pre-dravidian politics of Tamil Nadu is dominated by the Indian National Congress (INC). The Indian National Congress was the ruling party of Tamil Nadu for the first twenty years after independence, until a dravidian party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), swept the 1967 elections. Power has since shifted between the two major dravidian parties of the state, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). K. Kamaraj was the most influential leader during the Congress era in Tamil Nadu. Kamaraj was instrumental in the ascension and downfall of the first six Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu following independence: T. Prakasam, O.P. Ramaswamy Reddiar, Kumaraswamy Raja, C. Rajagopalachari, M. Bhakthavatsalam, and himself. Kamaraj originally threw his support behind T. Prakasam to prevent C. Rajagopalachari from becoming Chief Minister in 1946, however, Kamaraj felt it was too difficult to control Prakasam as he was Telugu and didn't feel the need to report to the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee. Kamaraj facilitated the ouster of Prakasam and the ascension of O.P. Ramaswamy Reddiar as Chief Minister in 1947. Ramaswamy and Kamaraj eventually had a falling out which led to Ramaswamy's downfall though he was Tamil and originally became Chief Minister with Kamaraj's support. Kamaraj eventually elevated Kumaraswamy Raja to the position of Chief Minister in 1949‚Äîa position which Raja retained till he lost his seat in the general election of 1952. The general election of 1952 temporarily reduced the Congress Party to a minority in the state legislative assembly. Though Congress held the most seats in the state legislative assembly‚Äî152 out of 375, they did not meet the required 188 seats to prove a governing majority. In response, communist parties began to build a post-election coalition challenging the Congress party. The coalition, the United Democratic Front (UDF), comprised 30 independents as well as the Communist Party of India (CPI) and CPI backed independents, Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP), Tamil Nadu Toilers Party, Commonweal Party, Forward Block (Marxist Group) also known as FBL (MG), All India Scheduled Caste Federation (SCF), and Justice Party (JUSP). With 166 legislative seats, the UDF staked their claim to form a government. The Governor at the time, Maharaja Krishna Kumarsinhji Bhavsinhji, decided to refer the matter to the President of India, Rajendra Prasad, rather than cause controversy at the end of his term as Governor. Per the Constitution, the President sought the advice of the Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was unable to make a decision on the matter. With the situation at a standstill, Kamaraj was in favor of allowing the UDF to form a government as he believed the coalition government would be short- lived thus providing an opportunity for Congress to gain power back. However, many were opposed to Kamaraj's proposal as they were outraged by the possibility of a Communist government, and turned to Rajagopalachari, a staunch anti-Communist, to lead the government as Chief Minister. Set to lead the state government, Rajagopalachari decided he would not seek election to the state legislature as he believed it was below his status. As Rajagopalachari would not seek election to the lower house of the state legislature, the interim Chief Minister, Kumaraswamy Raja, promptly recommended Rajagopalachari's appointment to the upper house of the state legislature, and the new Governor, Sri Prakasa, swiftly accepted the recommendation. Rajagopalachari was then invited by Prakasa to form the state government and asked to prove his majority in the state legislature. Rajagopalachari proved a majority more than three months later by convincing opposition members to defect, and allying himself with parties that had not joined the UDF. Kamaraj increased his stronghold over Tamil Nadu politics following the separation of the Telugu-speaking areas from Tamil Nadu in 1953, and facilitated the removal of Rajagopalachari as Chief Minister in 1954 after Rajagopalachari's implementation of the unpopular Modified Scheme of Elementary Education. Kamaraj then ascended to the Chief Ministership himself, and would remain in that position for the next nine years. As Chief Minister, Kamaraj paid special attention to education as that was the issue that led to his predecessor's downfall. Education was made compulsory and free to all children till the age of 14. 25,234 schools were opened between 1954 and 1962 so that villages with populations greater than 500 had at least one or more schools. At the same time, secondary education was restructured‚Äîmathematics, science, and social studies were made compulsory subjects, and students were provided the opportunity to learn their language of choice as well as Hindi and English. Enrollment in primary and secondary schools doubled from 1955 to 1962. By 1954, the state government had opened 140 training schools for teachers. In 1955, the Tamil Nadu government was the first in Asia to provide a provident fund, pensions, and insurance for teachers. The School Midday Meal Scheme launched in 1957 as an incentive to increase enrollment. Beginning in 1960, school uniforms were provided free of cost to children. The state government implemented the School Improvement Movement in 1958 which led to 24,656 schools receiving donations worth about 7,93,00,000 rupees from the public by 1963. Irrigation was another major focus of the Tamil Nadu government as Kamaraj believed improved irrigation would increase food production and wanted to utilize the hydroelectric capabilities of dams and reservoirs. Nine large-scale irrigation projects reaching about 3,34,000 acres were completed by the state government during the first five year plan (1951-1956) for a total cost of about 29,00,00,000 rupees. Another six irrigation projects reaching about 2,92,000 acres were completed during the second five year plan (1965-1961). The state government pursued multiple large-scale power generation projects to improve electrification‚Äî22,103 villages had electricity in 1966, up from 813 villages in 1951. Five industrial zones were created throughout the state to spur growth in heavy industries and multiple industrial estates were created to encourage smaller industries. The Madras Cultivating Tenants Act of 1956 and the Madras Land Reforms Act of 1962 improved farmers rights. Social welfare schemes aimed at improving conditions for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes as well as women were implemented. Tamil became the official language of the state in 1958, and the first Tamil encyclopedia published by the Tamil Academy was presented in 1962. Kamaraj resigned in 1963 to focus on the revival of the Congress party. M. Bhakthavatsalam succeeded Kamaraj and would remain Chief Minister until the election of 1967 when power shifted to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. = Rise of Dravidian politics = Dravidian parties have dominated state politics since 1967. One of the earliest regional parties was the South Indian Welfare Association, which was founded in 1916. It came to be known as the Justice Party after the name of its English-language daily, Justice. E.V. Ramasami, popularly known as \\"Periyar\\", renamed the party Dravidar Kazhagam in 1944. DK was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called Dravida Nadu. However, due to the differences between its two leaders Periyar and C.N. Annadurai, the party was split. Annadurai left the party to form the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The DMK decided to enter into politics in 1956. The Anti-Hindi agitations in the mid-1960s made the DMK more popular and more powerful political force in the state. The DMK routed the Indian National Congress party in the 1967 elections and took control of the state government, ending Congress's stronghold in Tamil Nadu. C.N. Annadurai became the DMK's first Chief Minister, and Muthuvel Karunanidhi took over as Chief Minister and party leader after Annadurai's death in 1969. Karunanidhi's leadership was soon challenged by M.G. Ramachandran, popularly known as MGR. In 1972, he split from DMK and formed the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). He was the Chief Minister of the state from 1977 until his death in 1987. After the death of MGR, the party split again into two factions, one led by Janaki Ramachandran, wife of MGR, and the other led by J. Jayalalithaa. After the defeat of AIADMK in 1989 assembly polls, both factions were merged and Jayalalithaa took control of the party. She was elected as the General Secretary of the unified AIADMK. There have been splits in both the DMK and the AIADMK, but since 1967 one of those two parties has held power in the state. In the State elections after M.G. Ramachandran's death, neither of the two parties could come back to power in consecutive assembly elections. Governments were formed by: DMK in 1989, AIADMK in 1991, DMK alliance in 1996, AIADMK alliance in 2001, DMK alliance in 2006 and AIADMK alliance consecutively in 2011 and 2016. = Tamil Nationalism in politics = Tamil Nationalism has been part of the Tamil political Arena ever since a Tamil identity pride has been created among the Tamil populace in the late 19th century. Dravidian movement and Tamil nationalism rose from the same roots. They differed in very few but were identical in important topics, such as eradication of casteism , promoting religious equality and extermination of untouchability. While Dravidian parties take these topics at the same level of Promotion of Tamil, the Tamil organizations sole priority was promotion of Tamil. On multiple occasions they were religious and sometimes refused to acknowledge the caste problems. During the Anti Hindi Imposition Movement, the Tamil Nationalist organizations converged with Dravidian parties on the common ground of Protecting and Promoting Tamil. In the next oncoming decades, the relevance of the Tamil Nationalist Parties reduced to a great degree. Still many Tamil Nationalist organizations keep on working on promotion of Tamil identity. Such parties and their policies can be classified into a wider spectrum. There are organizations which claim every person with an intent to promote Tamil identity as a Tamil. At the same time, few elements classify and deny Tamil identity to the people of Tamil Nadu based on Caste lines, which is in total contrast to the former type. After the death of Velupillai Prabhakaran, a revival, even though not a big enough to create an impact in political balance, is seen. The success of this new wave is yet to be seen.  Political culture of Tamil Nadu  = Social Welfare Schemes = Politics in Tamil Nadu has had a strongly socialist character since the rise of Dravidian politics in the 1960s. In Tamil Nadu, AIADMK and DMK are alternately elected by people in Tamil Nadu and a strong third party does not exist. Both AIADMK and DMK, the major political parties in Tamil Nadu, as per their political and economic policy, made sure that the people of the state receive the fruits of the modern technology. Whichever party was in the rule, made sure that all the households have a television set, the womenfolk have access to work on the economy of their family by providing them household appliances and the students have all the necessary tools to reach and complete their education namely bicycle, textbooks, stationery and laptops. At the same time, the promise of and distribution of freebies is considered and criticized to be a form of bribery, disguised as people welfare. The right wing political parties and economists feel that the fiscal profligacy and handouts don‚Äôt make economic sense and, importantly, they tend to make people lazy. The leftists and the left leaning parties have raised concerns about the revenue model used for financing the freebie schemes. They accuse the two parties of depoliticizing the electorate and bribing the voters to turn blind eye to the corruptions of the regimes These social welfare schemes provide the Dravidian faction of the Tamilnadu politics an edge over the other regional and national parties. = Caste Politics = Tamil Nadu has seen numerous caste based parties, serving two purposes. Either to represent the genuine concerns of the oppressed communities or to create Votebanks for ruling parties. The Dalit political parties, representing the oppressed societies have been fighting for social justice. Typically reservation in education and job opportunities are demanded by such parties. In Tamil Nadu such parties are also supporters of Tamil Nationalism. Rarely some of the parties have claimed that the castes they represent are oppressed by being declared a part of the Scheduled castes list. They demand removal of their caste from Scheduled castes list and to rename their caste. However, people from the relatively upper castes also have founded political parties. They fear that their opportunities are robbed by the concessions extended to the SC and ST communities. They have demanded to get their castes declared as backward to avail reservation. The effect of the caste politics is debatable and could not be expected to end in near future. In 2001, the sitting DMK government came up with a huge a alliance with caste parties and was defeated in 2001 assembly election. Still caste based political parties are part of both the ruling and opposition alliances in all the successive elections. = Celebrity worship = Many people from the Tamil film industry are active in Tamil Nadu politics. Some of the Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu like M. G. Ramachandran, M. Karunanidhi and J. Jayalalithaa have their background in the Tamil film industry. Kamal Haasan who enjoys a great stardom already entered into Tamil Nadu politics in 2018. Rajinikanth who is enjoying a demigod status in Tami Nadu is in the race to start a political party in 2020. The worship of party leader by members is widely spread in Tamil Nadu, sometimes it reaches a fanatical level. This worship culture originates during the era of M.G.R. The youngsters were often a factor that changes the dynamic of Tamil Nadu politics, what can be seen in Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu, 2013 Anti‚ÄìSri Lanka protests and 2017 pro-jallikattu protests.  Political parties in Tamil Nadu  Political parties in Tamil Nadu are dominated by two major parties, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).

The band's name is derived from the German word Nacht meaning \\"night\\", and the made-up term mystium which resembles the Latin adjective mysticum. Judd and McCormick combined the words to create the band's name, which they state means \\"Encompassing Darkness\\". Nachtmystium released multiple critically praised albums between 2005 and 2012, including Instinct: Decay (2005), Assassins: Black Meddle, Part I (2008), and Silencing Machine (2012). Controversy marred the band's success in 2013 when Judd was arrested for theft charges and publicly admitted he had a severe drug problem. Nachtmystium went on a four- year hiatus until 2017, when Judd reformed the band to record new studio material and perform at four concerts. Judd ultimately disbanded Nachtmystium in 2020. History Nachtmystium was founded by Blake Judd and Pat McCormick as a side project.\\"Nachtmystium, Official MySpace Homepage\\". Retrieved on 2008-06-02 The band was heavily influenced by second-wave black metal bands, such as Darkthrone and Burzum, evidenced in their low-fi first release Reign of the Malicious in 2002. The band‚Äôs next release, Demise (2004), was described by Judd as Nachtmystium's \\"last straight forward 'raw black metal' record.\\" The band's following two releases, Eulogy IV (2004) and Instinct: Decay (2006), incorporated psychedelic and experimental musical elements that were pioneered by bands like Black Sabbath, The Doors and Pink Floyd. Instinct: Decay received general positive feedback from critics. DEAF SPARROW Zine praised the album for its innovation, while Decibel Magazine went even further to name Instinct: Decay as the fourth best album of 2006. The band released Assassins: Black Meddle, Part I on June 10, 2008 in America. The album received a generally positive critical reception, especially from Pitchfork Media and MTV's Headbangers Ball, who both stated that it was one of the year's best releases. Live at Hole in the Sky, 2008 Assassins' success caused the band's popularity to increase. Nachtmystium played their first Scandinavian show in Bergen, Norway at the 2008 Hole in the Sky Festival with At the Gates, Municipal Waste, and Meshuggah. Nachtmystium toured with Opeth, Baroness, and High on Fire for the first half of their American tour. In 2009, the band released a remastered version of Demise, with two extra tracks. and also released a new EP, entitled Doomsday Derelicts. The band experienced two major setbacks in February and March 2009. Nachtmystium was forced to withdraw from the Scion Rock Fest in Atlanta, Georgia due to alleged connections to National Socialist black metal (see Connection to NSBM section). Later that month, Judd injured his leg, forcing the band to cancel their tour with The Haunted. In September 2009, Nachtmystium announced plans to release a follow- up album to Assassins: Black Meddle, Part I with an album titled Addicts: Black Meddle, Part II. Judd commented that the album would feature new material with \\"more of a rock and roll edge over all\\", and reflect the bands interest in post-rock and industrial music. The album debuted on June 8, 2010. The band played at the Inferno Festival in Oslo, Norway, on April 3, 2010, where they shared the stage with Mayhem, Finntroll, and Taake. Nachtmystium also toured across the United States with Cradle of Filth and Turisas in early 2011. Nachtmystium began recording for their new album in early 2011. The progress of the album was impeded by the departure of Judd's longtime band mate and friend, Jeff Wilson, who left Nachtmystium for personal reasons. Finally, in 2012, Nachtmystium released their sixth full-length studio album, Silencing Machine. The album marked a departure from the band's previous two Black Meddle albums. Judd described the album as \\"a follow-up to Instinct: Decay\\". He further stated that the album has \\"still some psychedelic vibes here and there, but overall it's much more on par towards our older material\\". Silencing Machine was positively received by critics, including Sputnikmusic, Allmusic, and Popmatters. Pitchfork Media summarized their review of the album by stating, \\"Silencing Machine is an impressive and stylish reinvention of an earlier form by a band that could've easily lost the plot, but instead reigned in the excess, and wrote us a new one.\\" The band resumed production on a new studio album during the summer of 2013. However, Judd was arrested on October 5, 2013 on misdemeanor theft charges. The incident exposed Judd's heroin addiction to the public and forced him to seek drug rehabilitation. Nachtmystium canceled their remaining concerts while Judd focused on completing the band's next album, The World We Left Behind. After finalizing the album, Judd announced Nachtmystium was disbanding after a 13-year run on November 13. The World We Left Behind was released on August 5, 2014. The album garnered mixed critical reception. Critics were polarized by the album's song structure and lyrical composition. The Line of Best Fit praised The World We Left Behind, stating \\"[Nachtmystium] have returned to their best style ‚Äî tempered, refined heavy rock that uses the finest extracts of black metal to supplement an already engrossing sound. Pitchfork Media cited flaws such as \\"the absence of transition and sequence, the lack of focus and coherence, the presence of awful lyrics and middling riffs.\\". The Quietus summed up the album stating, \\"it is predominately dull and uninspired. It is a truly forgettable album written during a time that its creator would clearly like to forget.\\" In late August, multiple fans complained that they failed to receive copies of The World We Left Behind that they purchased directly from Judd. Prior to his 2013 arrest, fans accused Judd of failing to fulfill purchase agreements without issuing refunds. Judd stated that he had run out of copies for distribution and was waiting for Century Media to deliver more copies to him. As more and more customers began to question the status of their orders, Judd and Nachtmystium's Facebook storefronts were abruptly shutdown without any explanation. On September 5, Century Media issued an official statement about the situation and asked fans to contact them directly about unfulfilled orders from Judd. The label also announced that they will no longer work with Nachtmystium to release and distribute new albums. Deadlight Entertainment, a French label that was producing and distributing band merchandise and albums, also announced they were cutting ties with Nachtmystium in wake of Judd's questionable past business practices and recent controversy. Alt URL Judd later admitted to selling merchandise to customers without intending to ever fulfill their orders. He claimed to have spent the stolen money on heroin until his scam exposed. In January 2016, Judd resurfaced to apologize to fans and reveal he was no-longer involved with the music industry. In April, Judd posted a compilation of previously unreleased Nachtmystium recordings and remixes on YouTube. On November 1, Judd announced that Earache Records had acquired the rights to redistribute Nachtmystium's five studio albums, as well as a new compilation album, titled Retox: Remixes and Rarities, which contains several remixes and covers that Judd previously released on YouTube. Judd also announced he would work with Earache Records to resolve unfulfilled merchandise. He released the following statement: \\"Thank you all for your patience and I do hope to make things right with everyone I can who fell victim to my addiction issues by not receiving orders for music or merchandise. I intend on giving away every single record and CD I receive of these reissues, if that‚Äôs what it takes, to make things right with the fans whom I wronged and did not fulfill orders for.\\" In March 2017, Judd announced that Nachtmystium would re-unite after a four-year hiatus to play four live shows and record a new EP, titled Resilient. The band performed at the \\"Festum Carnis Open Air Festival\\" in Wilseyville, California on July 7 and the Louisville Death Fest in Louisville, Kentucky on September 29. While at Festum Carnis, Judd issued refunds to fans he defrauded and offered to reimburse their concert admission fee. Judd announced on September 11 that Nachtmystium had signed a new record deal with Prophecy Productions to distribute Resilient, which was released in November 2018. Nachtmystium began working on the third installment of the Black Meddle series in early 2020. However, Judd abruptly disbanded Nachtmystium on June 14, 2020. He released a statement on the band's official Facebook page explaining his desire to move onto other musical projects and professional endeavors. Musical style Nachtmystium's line-up has frequently changed since its formation. Furthermore, while the band originally started as a black metal band, and even toured with black metal acts such as Angelcorpse, Goatwhore and Watain, Judd has frequently stated that the band should not be considered black metal per se. In an interview with DEAF SPARROW Zine, Judd stated, \\"What separates us from your average black metal band is that we're NOT a black metal band, we're a 'do- whatever-the-fuck-we-want' metal band and black metal happens to be what we build our foundation off of (in the case of Instinct: Decay and its predecessors), if you must categorize the rhythm sections of our music (rhythm guitars, bass and drums ‚Äî the core of any album).\\" J. Bennet of Decibel Magazine described the band's sound as \\"Blackadelia\\". Jason Bracelin, of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, compared the band's latter work to Pink Floyd, claiming, \\"[Assassins] is what happens when Pink goes black.\\" Since the release of Assassins, the band has received additional press-coverage and attention from media outlets, including Metal Maniacs, Terrorizer, CMJ New Music Monthly, and Metalkult.com. Despite their departure from the black metal genre, Carlos Ramirez of IGN.com listed Assassins as one of the ten greatest black metal albums. Judd recruited Chris Black to produce Nachtmyium's later albums and compose lyrics. Black's themes and lyrics from Addicts: Black Meddle, Part II were inspired by Judd's heroin addiction. Judd assumed songwriting duties for Nachtmytium's final studio album, The World We Left Behind, and included many lyrics about his personal struggles with addiction. Connection to NSBM Nachtmystium's second demo, entitled Unholy Terrorist Cult, was unofficially re-released by Vinland Winds, an American National Socialist black metal (NSBM) record label, in 2001. Vinland Winds made CD-Rs without the band's knowledge and designed their own layout for the CD-Rs that were distributed with different cover art. In 2002, their first full-length album, Reign of the Malicious, was released on Regimental Records and then distributed by Unholy Records, who were an imprint of the white power skinhead label Resistance Records, and dealt mostly with National Socialist black metal bands.J. Bennett, Decibel, May 2006. \\"NSBM Special Report\\" Access date: September 18, 2008. Judd claims that upon learning of the arrangement, he did not want Nachtmystium to become associated with a NSBM label, and demanded Resistance Records stop selling the band‚Äôs albums. In 2005, Metalreviews.com interviewed Judd to discuss Nachtmystium's recent work and background. During the interview, Judd dismissed MTV and the mainstream media as \\"Zionist means of demoralizing young American's [sic] artistic standards.\\" He initially claimed the statement was taken out of context, but later remorsefully acknowledged and renounced his comment. In 2006, Judd said, ‚ÄúIn the past, we‚Äôve had some indirect ties to labels and bands that are part of the NS scene. At one point not too many years ago, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for NS labels or bands to trade and work with non-politically motivated bands and labels because at the end of the day, we‚Äôre all trying to promote, release, and be involved with music‚Äîall politics aside. Today it seems like there‚Äôs less of a connection, at least for me and my label. We don‚Äôt oppose people‚Äôs right to be ‚ÄòNS‚Äô or whatever‚Äîthat‚Äôs a personal choice, and if you live in the USA, you have the right to that opinion. Even though I personally, my band(s) and my label have absolutely no interest in being a part of that scene, I will ALWAYS take their side when it comes to their freedom of speech being imposed upon.‚Äù Just before the Atlanta, Georgia Scion Rock Fest on Saturday February 28, 2009, Nachtmystium was forced to cancel at the request of the festival's promoters, and sponsors, Toyota, on Tuesday February 23, 2008 due to an unnamed source, who believed the group was a \\"Nazi\\" band.Nachtmystium, February 2009. Myspace. Access date: February 27, 2008 Judd promptly released a statement after the incident, stating, \\"We will be taking legal action against the people who slandered us in this situation, and in the future will file defamation / slander charges against any person or organization who attempts to prevent us from performing anywhere, especially in the United States. So - let it be known loud and clear for the LAST TIME, we ARE NOT a Nazi band, ARE NOT political, are certainly NOT racists and DO NOT support that world or any band, person or business affiliated with it.\\" He also apologized to Nachtmystium fans who traveled to the concert to support the band.

The name refers metaphorically to a geological watershed, or drainage divide, which separates adjacent drainage basins. The watershed transformation treats the image it operates upon like a topographic map, with the brightness of each point representing its height, and finds the lines that run along the tops of ridges. There are different technical definitions of a watershed. In graphs, watershed lines may be defined on the nodes, on the edges, or hybrid lines on both nodes and edges. Watersheds may also be defined in the continuous domain.L. Najman and M. Schmitt. Watershed of a continuous function. In Signal Processing (Special issue on Mathematical Morphology.), Vol. 38 (1994), pages 99‚Äì112 There are also many different algorithms to compute watersheds. Watershed algorithms are used in image processing primarily for segmentation purposes.

Beucher and C. Lantu√©joul.Serge Beucher and Christian Lantu√©j workshop on image processing, real-time edge and motion detection (1979). http://cmm.ensmp.fr/~beucher/publi/watershed.pdf The basic idea consisted of placing a water source in each regional minimum in the relief, to flood the entire relief from sources, and build barriers when different water sources meet. The resulting set of barriers constitutes a watershed by flooding. A number of improvements, collectively called Priority-Flood, have since been made to this algorithm.Barnes, R., Lehman, C., Mulla, D., 2014. Priority- flood: An optimal depression-filling and watershed-labeling algorithm for digital elevation models. Computers & Geosciences 62, 117‚Äì127. =Watershed by topographic distance= Intuitively, a drop of water falling on a topographic relief flows towards the \\"nearest\\" minimum. The \\"nearest\\" minimum is that minimum which lies at the end of the path of steepest descent. In terms of topography, this occurs if the point lies in the catchment basin of that minimum. The previous definition does not verify this condition. =Watershed by the drop of water principle= Intuitively, the watershed is a separation of the regional minima from which a drop of water can flow down towards distinct minima. A formalization of this intuitive idea was provided in J. Cousty, G. Bertrand, L. Najman and M. Couprie. Watershed Cuts: Minimum Spanning Forests and the Drop of Water Principle, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 31(8) pp. 1362-1374, 2009, for defining a watershed of an edge-weighted graph. =Inter-pixel watershed= S. Beucher and F. Meyer introduced an algorithmic inter-pixel implementation of the watershed method,Serge Beucher and Fernand Meyer. The morphological approach to segmentation: the watershed transformation. In Mathematical Morphology in Image Processing (Ed. E. R. Dougherty), pages 433‚Äì481 (1993). given the following procedure: # Label each minimum with a distinct label. Initialize a set with the labeled nodes. # Extract from a node x of minimal altitude F, that is to say F(x) = min{F(y)y ‚àà S}. Attribute the label of x to each non- labeled node y adjacent to x, and insert y in S. # Repeat Step 2 until is empty. =Topological watershed= Previous notions focus on catchment basins, but not to the produced separating line. The topological watershed was introduced by M. Couprie and G. Bertrand in 1997,M. Couprie, G. Bertrand. Topological gray-scale watershed transform. In Proc. of SPIE Vision Geometry V, volume 3168, pages 136‚Äì146 (1997). http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.3.7654&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf and beneficiate of the following fundamental property. A function W is a watershed of a function F if and only if W ‚â§ F and W preserves the contrast between the regional minima of F; where the contrast between two regional minima M1 and M2 is defined as the minimal altitude to which one must climb in order to go from M1 to M2.G. Bertrand. On topological watersheds. Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, 22(2‚Äì3), pages 217‚Äì230 (2005). An efficient algorithm is detailed in the paper.Michel Couprie, Laurent Najman, Gilles Bertrand. Quasi-linear algorithms for the topological watershed. Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, Springer Verlag, 2005, 22 (2-3), pp.231-249. Watershed algorithm Different approaches may be employed to use the watershed principle for image segmentation. * Local minima of the gradient of the image may be chosen as markers, in this case an over-segmentation is produced and a second step involves region merging. * Marker based watershed transformation make use of specific marker positions which have been either explicitly defined by the user or determined automatically with morphological operators or other ways. =Meyer's flooding algorithm= One of the most common watershed algorithms was introduced by F. Meyer in the early 1990s, though a number of improvements, collectively called Priority-Flood, have since been made to this algorithm,Barnes, R., Lehman, C., Mulla, D., 2014.

Parallel priority-flood depression filling for trillion cell digital elevation models on desktops or clusters. Computers & Geosciences. The algorithm works on a gray scale image. During the successive flooding of the grey value relief, watersheds with adjacent catchment basins are constructed. This flooding process is performed on the gradient image, i.e. the basins should emerge along the edges. Normally this will lead to an over-segmentation of the image, especially for noisy image material, e.g. medical CT data. Either the image must be pre-processed or the regions must be merged on the basis of a similarity criterion afterwards. # A set of markers, pixels where the flooding shall start, are chosen. Each is given a different label. # The neighboring pixels of each marked area are inserted into a priority queue with a priority level corresponding to the gradient magnitude of the pixel. # The pixel with the highest priority level is extracted from the priority queue. If the neighbors of the extracted pixel that have already been labeled all have the same label, then the pixel is labeled with their label. All non-marked neighbors that are not yet in the priority queue are put into the priority queue. # Redo step 3 until the priority queue is empty. The non-labeled pixels are the watershed lines.

They establish the consistency of these watersheds: they can be equivalently defined by their ‚Äúcatchment basins‚Äù (through a steepest descent property) or by the ‚Äúdividing lines‚Äù separating these catchment basins (through the drop of water principle). Then they prove, through an equivalence theorem, their optimality in terms of minimum spanning forests. Afterward, they introduce a linear-time algorithm to compute them. It is worthwhile to note that similar properties are not verified in other frameworks and the proposed algorithm is the most efficient existing algorithm, both in theory and practice.

She was born as Princess Wilhelmina Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt as the fifth child of Louis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and his spouse Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibr√ºcken. Life =Early years= Born in Prenzlau, Uckermark, Brandenburg, Prussia as the sixth child and fourth daughter of the nine children born from the Landgravial couple, Wilhelmina Louisa Augusta of Hesse-Darmstadt was brought up under the strict supervision of her mother, nicknamed \\"The Great Landgr√§fin\\", famed as one of the most learned women of her time and who befriended several writers and philosophers of her time, such as Goethe, Herder and other celebrities of that time. Already in her youth, Wilhelmina was distinguished by an outstanding mind, strong character and ardent temperament. =Journey to Russia and Marriage= In 1772, Tsarevich Pavel Petrovich of Russia was 18-years-old, and his mother, Empress Catherine II, began the search for a bride for him. After a long search, two candidates remained: Sophia Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg and Wilhelmina. But Sophia Dorothea was just 13-years-old, and Catherine II urgently needed an heir, so the Empress was forced to opt for one of the remaining three unmarried daughters of the Landgrave; however, this option did not please her. In a letter to her envoy, she wrote: King Frederick II of Prussia ‚Äî to whom Catherine turned for \\"recommendations\\" in this matter ‚Äî wanted the marriage, moreover because the Landgrave's eldest daughter Frederica was married to the heir of the Prussian throne and so, an alliance between Prussia and Russia would be a beneficial outcome. In October 1772, Catherine wrote to Nikita Ivanovich Panin: An anonymous portrait of Wilhelmine Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, soon to be the Tsesarevna of Russia. Unable to decide which one was worthy, the Empress sent an invitation to Wilhelmina, her sisters and their mother to visit Russia. The three Princesses studied to perfect their French, worked on their dancing, practiced dropping deep curtseys, and completed their wardrobes. Their first stop was in Berlin where from there a flotilla of four ships, sent by Catherine, which took them to Russia. It was the Grand Duke Paul's best friend, young Andrei Razumovsky, who commanded the frigate that carried the young ladies and their mother. He was immediately captivated by these charming passengers, and was particularly taken with Wilhelmine. She was not insensible to the admiration of Andrei. The meeting of the Tsarevich with the Hessian princesses occurred in Gatchina on 15 June 1773. Paul chose Wilhelmina; she was very pretty, gay and exuberant, and the heir of the Russian throne was very delighted with her. Catherine wrote: On 27 June 1773 the Landgravine of Hesse-Darmstadt and her three daughters were awarded with the Order of Saint Catherine. Almost one month later, on 15 August, Princess Wilhelmina was accepted in the Orthodox faith with the name and title of Grand Duchess Natalia Alexeievna, and the next day her betrothal with the Tsarevich Paul took place amidst great ostentation. =Tsarevna= Grand Duchess Natalia Alexeivna, bust by Marie-Anne Collot, 1775. Currently at Saint Michael's Castle, Saint Petersburg. On 29 September 1773, the wedding between Tsarevich Paul Petrovich and Natalia Alexeievna took place in the Church of the Nativity of the Most Holy Theotokos (currently Kazan Cathedral). Very soon she showed her domineering and impetuous nature: the English envoy James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury noted that she \\"ruled her husband despotically, without even giving herself the trouble to show the least attachment to him.\\" During the first few months of her marriage, Natalia's gaiety and spontaneity animated the whole court. The Empress was delighted with her initially, but as time passed difficulties started to appear. The new Tsarevna's union was a failure: although Paul Petrovich loved his wife, Natalia was disappointed with her life as a married woman; for this, she began several political intrigues against Catherine II in order to help her husband to take the throne, because she felt such a need to accede to power due to her disastrous conjugal life. In addition, the Tsarevna refused to learn Russian and, being raised in modern Europe, showed certain independence in her statements, adhering to liberal ideas and even occasionally advocated the liberation of the peasants. Catherine II clearly didn't like her daughter-in-law's behavior. She wrote: Despite the fact that the Tsarevna wasn't in love with her husband, she used her influence over him and tried to keep him away from everyone except for a narrow circle of her friends. According to contemporaries, the Tsarevna was a serious and ambitious woman, with a proud heart and a cool temper. In addition, she had been married for two years, but there was still no heir, to the concern of the court and the Empress. However, in early 1776 the long-awaited pregnancy of the Tsarevna was officially announced to the court. Rumours of her affair with the charming Andrey Razumovsky aroused doubts about the real paternity of the child; however, for Catherine II didn't seem to care if was her son's or Andrei's. Natalia was carrying the heir to the Russian throne, and for the Empress, that was all that mattered. =Death= Grand Duchess Natalia portrayed the year of her death, by Alexander Roslin. On 10 April 1776 around 4 a.m., the Tsarevna began the first labour pains. The contractions lasted for several days, and despite this, the baby couldn't be born naturally. The child died in the womb and infected the mother's body. Simon Sebag-Montefiore: \\"Potemkin\\" (in Russian) [retrieved 31 July 2020]. After five days of torment at 5 a.m. on 15 April, Grand Duchess Natalia Alexeievna finally died after giving birth to a stillborn son.Genealogical book of the All-Russian nobility (in Russian). Compiled by V. Durasov. - Part I. - St. Petersburg, 1906. Catherine II wrote: Natalia Alexeivna's tombstone at Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, Saint Petersburg. Her devastated husband‚Äôs grief was so severe that he initially refused to allow Natalia‚Äôs body to be removed. Finally, Natalia was buried in the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg. The Empress disliked Natalia Alexeievna, and the court gossiped that she didn't allow the doctors to save her daughter-in-law. The autopsy, however, showed that the Grand Duchess had a birth defect called spinal curvature (scoliosis),Alexey Morokhin: Curvature of the mill (in Russian) [retrieved 31 July 2020]. and reportedly in childhood she suffered from a hunchback or stoop, which was corrected, according to the custom of that time, with a rigid corset, which led to an incorrect arrangement of the bones in such way that could be impossible for Natalia to have a baby naturally through the birth canal, and that the medicine of that time was powerless to help her. The Chevalier de Corberon reported that no one believed the official autopsy and that Potemkin ‚Äîfollowing Catherine II's orders‚Äî visited Natalia's midwife, named Zorich, and gave her the order to kill the Grand Duchess. Also, the Chevalier questioned the surgeon Moreau during a later dinner, and he wrote: Ancestry References Bibliography * H. Troyat: Catherine the Great, 1980 * A.

She was noted for her unique filming style that incorporated collage.Profile , hcl.harvard.edu; accessed March 18, 2015. Early life Menken was born in Brooklyn, New York, on May 25, 1909, to a Roman Catholic immigrant couple from Lithuania.Su√°rez, p. 61 She studied at the New York School of Fine and Industrial Arts as well as the Art Students League of New York and honed her craft as a painter. To support herself, she worked as a secretary at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum before receiving a scholarship from Yaddo and moving to upstate New York.Su√°rez, p.61 Mr. & Mrs. Menkevicius Marie and Adele Menken Professional career Menken and her husband Willard Maas began a well-respected avant-garde art group known as The Gryphon Group in the mid-1940s.Su√°rez, p.59 It was around this time that Menken, bored by the static nature of paint on canvas, began to experiment with film. She released her first film, Visual Variations on Noguchi, in 1945 to acclaim within experimental art circles of the time. She used a hand-held and hand-cranked 16mm Bolex camera for this as well as many of her later films, contributing to the spontaneity and agility of her work. Noguchi is a non-narrative film that combines quick, decontextualized shots of the sculptures of Isamu Noguchi with shrill, discordant music.Noguchi, imdb.com; accessed March 18, 2015. Menken and the Gryphon Group began to produce numerous short experimental films around the time of Noguchi's release. She also began to experiment with various types of animation techniques, including collage and stop-motion cinematography, owing to her background in painting. Her 1962 film Notebook was shot between 1940 and 1962, and is arguably her best-known film.arsenal, . It consists of short snippets of film she shot over the years spliced together in a meditative fashion. Menken continued to make films that both were influenced by and commented on the various art movements her contemporaries took part in, including abstract expressionism in Drips in Strips (1963) and pop art in Andy Warhol (1964). Personal life In 1931 she met Willard Maas, a professor of literature at Wagner College in Staten Island. They married in 1937, but it was a rocky and unstable marriage, described as a \\"succession of fights and drinking bouts\\".Su√°rez, p. 64 Menken and Maas lived at 62 Montague Street in Brooklyn. As core members of the Gryphon Group, Menken and Maas were highly respected by the experimental and avant-garde art circles of the time. Menken was known for her association with and influence on many of the leading members of the movement, including pop artist Andy Warhol, painter and experimental filmmakers Kenneth Anger and Stan Brakhage.Su√°rez, p. 59 According to the 2006 film documentary Notes on Marie Menken produced by Martina Kudl√°ƒçek, it was Marie who schooled Warhol on using the 16mm Bolex. The film presents never-before-seen footage by Menken salvaged from basements and storage vaults, including a camera \\"duel\\" for Bolexes between Menken and Andy Warhol; the two are seen dueling on top of a New York City building, facing each other with Bolex Cameras and dancing in circles around each other while gliding across the roof-top of Menken's penthouse apartment. Menken later appeared in such Warhol films as Screen Tests (1964), The Life of Juanita Castro (1965) and Chelsea Girls (1966), among others. Style Menken's painting style utilized unconventional mediums, particularly reflective materials such as glass, phosphorescent paint, and sequins. She attributed this to her desire to capture movement in her paintings, something that would eventually influence her move to film as well as her films' emphasis on the theme of light. Her background in painting was evident in her later experiments with animation, collage, and stop-motion work. Movement is prominent in her films, either slow and meditative or quick and spastic. Unlike many other avant-garde films at the time, her early films lacked any obvious symbolism, and were instead to be experienced purely visually.Profile, movies.nytimes.com; accessed March 18, 2015. Peter Kubelka states that she put the \\"medium of film\\" to its best usage and \\"transports the viewer to a new world\\". \\"Nobody before the invention of the Bolex and the usage of it by Marie has ever had in his brain material of thoughts of this kind ... I think Marie learn her filmmaking from letting the Bolex talk. Her films are expeditions, like Columbus, into a country she had not seen before herself.\\" Legacy Menken is lauded as one of the first filmmakers from the New York scene to endow the handheld camera with an elementary freedom, as it swings and sways its way around the scene. This was first apparent in Visual Variations on Noguchi (1945). Menken made this film while working as a studio assistant to Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Reflecting on the context within which the film was made, Menken shared: \\"I was working on something ‚Ä¶ for Noguchi, some special effects for The Seasons, a ballet by Merce Cunningham with music by John Cage, and while I was experimenting around, I had the advantage of looking around Isamu‚Äôs studio with a clear, unobstructed eye. I asked if I might come in and shoot around, and he said yes. I did that. And when he saw that footage, he was entertained and delighted. So was I. It was fun. All art should be fun in a sense and give one a kick.\\" Visual Variations on Noguchi was Menken‚Äôs attempt to ‚Äúcapture the flying spirit of movement within these [sculptural] objects.‚Äù In an effort to express how she felt while looking at Noguchi‚Äôs sculptures, she began dancing amongst them, capturing her own movements, affections and rhythmic encounters with the environment. After seeing the film, Stan Brakhage explained that: ‚ÄúVisual Variation on Noguchi liberated a lot of independent filmmakers from the idea that had been so powerful up to then, that we have to imitate the Hollywood dolly shot, without dollies ‚Äì that the smooth pan and dolly was the only acceptable thing. Marie‚Äôs free, swinging, swooping hand-held pans changed all that, for me and for the whole independent filmmaking world.‚Äù In addition to her treatment of the camera, both Brakhage and Jonas Mekas also celebrated Menken as the ultimate film poetess. For Brakhage in particular, Menken ‚Äúmade a translation of poetic possibilities into the language of cinema.‚Äù This is a historic role that some (including film scholar Melissa Ragona) have argued limits the critical contribution of Menken's practice, reducing it to a means of contextualizing (and bolstering) Brakhage‚Äôs position in the history of experimental cinema. Indeed, Menken herself responded to Brakhage's determination by reminding him that: ‚ÄúThere is enough English poetry to read in a lifetime, why bother with attempts at translations from other languages?‚Äù Rather than identifying Menken‚Äôs work as a matter of poetic translation, Melissa Ragona (2007) argues that Moon Play and Night Writing in particular explore the painterly possibilities of working with light as a material and celluloid as a medium/canvas. For Ragona, Menken‚Äôs cinematic works are an attempt at pushing the limits of painting towards the kinetic. In 2006, Menken was the basis for documentary film Notes on Marie Menken by Martina Kudl√°ƒçek. The film featured Kenneth Anger, Stan Brakhage, Gerard Malanga, Jonas Mekas, and Marie's nephew, Joseph J. Menkevich. In 2007, her Glimpse of the Garden (1957) was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Glimpse Of The Garden, Exposition Universelle et Internationale de Bruxelles 1958 Filmography Menken was highly prolific and also worked on many films attributed to the Gryphon group, its members, and other filmmaking circles.

Sprague de Camp, part of his Viagens Interplanetarias series. It was first published under the title \\"Getaway on Krishna\\" in the magazine Ten Story Fantasy in the issue for Spring 1951. It first appeared in book form under the present title in the collection Sprague de Camp's New Anthology of Science Fiction, published simultaneously in hardcover by Hamilton and in paperback by Panther Books in 1953. Note: the error in the title is as per the source. Plot summary Set in the Antarctic region of the planet Krishna, \\"Calories\\" focuses on a long pursuit of two Earthmen, Cuthwin (\\"Dinky\\") Singer and Earl Okagamut, by a numerous and well-equipped cohort of fanatical soldiers from the Krishnan theocracy of Nichnyamadze. In contrast to their pursuers, Singer and Okagamut are possessed of a minimum of equipment and supplies. The chase tests the endurance of both fugitives and hunters, with the latter slowly but surely overtaking the former. In the end, however, the Krishnans halt and give up the chase, as Okagamut, who is of Inuit heritage, has calculated they must. Having determined the caloric requirements of the trip he knew that he and his companion, subsisting on dried meat, could complete the journey, while the soldiers, whose religion requires a vegetarian diet, could not. Worn out by the pursuit, they have no option but to return to more temperate climes or perish. The life-and-death clash the story was apparently building up to is precluded by Okagamut's display of cleverness. Setting The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to \\"get it right\\", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as \\"pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances‚Äîa sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes.\\"De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, Dec. 1959, page 3.) As dated in the 1959 version of de Camp's essay \\"The Krishna Stories\\", the action of \\"Calories\\" takes place in the year 2122 A.D., falling between the first part of \\"Finished\\" and Perpetual Motion, which would make it the second story set on Krishna in terms of chronology.De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, Dec. 1959, page 6) However, internal evidence indicates that it actually falls between The Queen of Zamba and the second part of \\"Finished\\", the attempt to break the Viagens embargo on advanced technology in the former being mentioned as recent news, while the characters show no knowledge of the equally notorious assault on the ban in the latter. This would date the story between the years 2138 and 2140, presumably about 2139, making it the fourth story set on Krishna.  Relationship to other works  This early Viagens story on the planet Krishna is something of a curiosity, being one of de Camp's set-piece gimmick yarns, a specialty of his at the beginning of his career but atypical of the sword and planet Krishna tales. Equally atypical is his departure from the Triple Seas area, the scene of all other stories set on Krishna, for the planet's Antarctic region, a choice possibly influenced by his then recent collaboration with Finn Ronne on the non-fiction book Antarctic Conquest: the Story of the Ronne Expedition 1946-1948 (1949). De Camp's work with Ronne may also be reflected in the early Krishna novel The Hand of Zei, in which the protagonist adopts the alias of an inhabitant of the planet's Antarctic and is, like de Camp, employed as a ghostwriter for his explorer boss.

Sometimes the court may be known by another name, such as the Court of Disputed Elections. In countries that derive their legal tradition from the United Kingdom, the legal tradition is that Parliament is the supreme law- making body in the country. That same tradition mandates that as Parliament is sovereign, it alone has authority and jurisdiction to determine who and how a person can be elected to Parliament. Implicit in that authority is the jurisdiction to determine whether a person has been validly elected. This is commonly known as a \\"disputed return\\" and which gives the court its name. The court is an attempt to eliminate the partisan nature of parliament and give the determination of electoral disputes to an independent and dispassionate neutral body. As parliament has the sole authority to determine these matters, parliament must create a special law to bring that body into existence to determine those disputes. A court of disputed returns may be constituted in a number of ways. The first is by the creation of a special court to perform that function. This has occurred in the Northern Territory of Australia where a special and separate court determines those disputes. Another way is for an existing court to be given the role of the court of disputed returns. Commonly, the phrase \\"the x court shall be the court of disputed returns\\". In this case, a separate court is not created, but the existing court is made into and given the jurisdiction of the court of disputed returns. The High Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of Victoria are each invested as courts of disputed returns in this manner. A court may also be simply be the venue for the determination of disputed returns. In New South Wales, the Land and Environment Court determines electoral disputes but is not a court of disputed returns. In some jurisdictions, the parliament of that country retains the right to determine disputed returns concurrently with the court of disputed returns. What this means is that both the parliament and the court may both decide the issue. Generally courts of disputed return have no rights of appeal, although this depends on the law which constitutes the court. History Prior to 1405, there was no codified process for resolving electoral disputes. Those disputes were resolved through what is described by authors Graeme Orr and George Williams as \\"custom, force and administrative action\\". This meant that there were no real rules in place to determine how these disputes were resolved. The manner of resolving a dispute in one county might be totally different from another county, or may result in a different outcome even if the same procedure was followed. The first laws to regulate elections in England were passed in the reign of Henry IV. This was through the law numbered \\"7 Henry IV ch 15\\" and called \\"The manner of the Election of Knights of the Shire for a Parliament\\", made in 1405. The law came about due to the confusion caused when letters were purportedly issued disqualifying lawyers from voting or being elected. In 1429, a law was passed allowing the common law courts to become involved in the determination of these disputes. In the 16th century, it was commonly regarded that the Court of Chancery could determine electoral disputes, particularly as that court issued the various writs to the sheriff and compiled their returns on the election During the reign of Elizabeth I, the election for Norfolk was disputed in 1586. The Court of Chancery investigated and decided to issue writs for a new election. However, the House of Commons set up its own committee which upheld the election. In 1604, during the reign of James I, a dispute arose as to the election of Sir Francis Goodwin for the seat of Buckinghamshire. The Court of Chancery investigated and determined that a new election should occur. However, the House of Commons established its own committee and found that Goodwin was validly elected. A compromise was made between the King and the House by holding a fresh election. From the early 17th century, the resolution of disputed returns became accepted as being the prerogative of Parliament. The Court of Chancery then became the means of administering the election process, but Parliament became the arbiter of disputes. By the 18th century, the process of Parliament determining disputes became tainted. The holding of a seat in Parliament became very valuable. Voting in Parliament had consolidated into voting along party lines. Issues were determined according to the numbers rather than the merits. Grenville‚Äôs Act of 1770 10 Geo 3 ch 16 established a jury system to reform the process but that process did not satisfactorily resolve the problem. In 1868 Parliament handed its power to determine disputes to the common law courts. Orr and Williams describe this as a \\"hot potato\\" that the courts reluctantly took on. The power was given to two judges of the Queen's Bench. It was described as being \\"what, according to British ideas, are normally the rights and privileges of the Assembly itself, always jealously maintained and guarded in complete independence of the Crown.\\" Australia In most states, the Court of Disputed Returns is the supreme court of that state. =Federal= The High Court of Australia is the Court of Disputed Returns for national elections in Australia.

Formative stage Foreign citizens were not allowed to engage in political activities in Sweden. However, in June 1942 a group of Norwegian exiles set up their study group in Stockholm. By October 1942 the couple Gunnar Myrdal and Alva Myrdal had joined the group. During its existence the International Group of Democratic Socialists gathered participants from 14 countries. As of 1942, it had some sixty members from different socialist parties from Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, France, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary. A working committee consisting of Hilding F√§rm (secretary of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth League), Inge Scheflo (Norwegian trade unionist), Fritz Tarnow (German trade unionist) and Ernst Paul (chairman of the Brotherhood of Sudeten German Social Democrats) organized the meetings of the study group. Peace committee In November 1942 a committee was set up to elaborate a common peace plan for post-war Europe. Paul was the chairman of the committee, Brandt (who was a member of both the Norwegian Labour Party and the German socialist diaspora) its secretary. Other members of the committee were Gunnar Myrdal (Sweden), Ole J√∂dahl (Sweden, foreign affairs editor of Aftontidningen and Tiden), Martin Tranm√¶l (Norway), Tarnow, Vilmos B√∂hm (Hungary), Istv√°n Szende (Hungarian, member of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany), Ji≈ô√≠ Jakerle (head of the Club of Czechoslovak Socialists), Maurycy Karniol (lawyer, representative of the Polish Socialist Party in Scandinavia), Jules Guesde (Press Attach√© of the Stockholm delegation of the French Committee of National Liberation) and Bruno Kreisky (chairman of the Club of Austrian Socialists in Sweden). The International Group of Democratic Socialists hoped that peace in Europe would be achieved in different ways that the Treaty of Versailles, seeking to strengthen cooperation in post-war Europe. Legacy Through the participation in the study group Myrdal became a political mentor of sorts to Brandt and Kreisky, who went on to lead governments in Germany and Austria respectively.

An opium lamp is an oil lamp designed specifically to facilitate the vaporization and inhalation of opium. Opium lamps differ from conventional lamps for lighting in that they are designed to channel an exact amount of heat upward through their funnel-shaped chimneys. An opium pipe, its pipe-bowl primed with a small dose of opium known as a \\"pill,\\" was held over the opium lamp causing the opium to vaporize and allowing the smoker to inhale the vapors.Opium Museum Opium lamps were crafted mainly in China before the communist revolution in 1949 brought opium smoking to an abrupt halt there. Small-scale production of opium lamps continued in Hong Kong and parts of Southeast Asia including Vietnam until the mid-1960s. Opium lamps were usually crafted from one or more types of metal such as silver, brass or paktong, an alloy also known as nickel silver. Often the metal parts of the lamp were adorned with cloisonn√©. The opium lamp's distinctive chimney was made from glass. Inexpensive lamps made entirely of molded glass were mass-produced and pieces of them are commonly found at historic Chinese settlements, such as the sites of former Chinese camps in the California goldfields. Examples of opium lamps crafted from Peking glass are sought after by collectors. Due to opium eradication campaigns in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, antique opium lamps are now rare.

The town's settlement centered on the Society of Friends and the meeting house that was first constructed there in 1859. The town was rendered a ghost town after 1870 when the expected Lake Erie Railroad did not come into town. Today the unincorporated community of Bentown, Illinois, exists near the site of the former town of Benjaminville. Geography The last remaining structure in Benjaminville is located at . The village of Benjaminville was located near the present-day community of Holder, Illinois, east of the city of Bloomington. The town was founded on an elevated area of flat, treeless prairie. Today, much of the area is used as crop land. Near the site of Benjaminville is the present-day unincorporated community of Bentown, Illinois.. Retrieved 21 June 2007. The townsite lies in both Dawson Township and Oldtown Township. History The Benjaminville Friends Meeting House is the only remaining building in the ghost town of Benjaminville Benjaminville was founded in 1856 when three Quaker families, those of Joseph Marot, Isaac Clement and Timothy Benjamin, arrived in the area.Koos, Greg. \\"Benjaminville Friends Meeting House ,\\" (PDF), National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, 24 October 1983, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, 21 June 2007. Settlement followed and was closely tied to the Society of Friends and the local church. The town grew gradually, in 1859 the first Meeting House was erected at a cost of US$1,000 and a burial ground was established soon after. Through the 1860s a slow but steady stream of Quakers moved to the area. In 1874 the Benjaminville Friends Meeting House was erected, the only structure still extant from the town of Benjaminville. Settlement continued through the 1870s and Benjaminville became a social, political and religious hub for Friends from Illinois. An 1879 history of McLean County called Benjaminville \\"one of the strongest settlements of Friends that is to be found anywhere in the state.\\" The members of the Society of Friends Benjaminville meeting often took political stances on issues of the day. Among these were, peace, Indian affairs, women's suffrage, and the evils of boxing, lotteries and gambling. Throughout the 19th century Benjaminville was home to a distinct local community of considerable political importance. Benjaminville never grew large though it did contain at least two churches besides the meeting house and a few shops. By 1870 the town's fate was sealed when the Lake Erie Railroad opted to bypass the town because of the elevation of its terrain.Benjaminville Friends Meeting House , Historical Markers, Illinois State Historical Society. Retrieved 22 January 2007. The local churches eventually moved closer to the new railroad and the town's businesses shut down. In 1981 the only other remaining structure, an old wagon shop, was destroyed by fire, leaving the meeting house as the last remnant of the town.

Whereas religion regards an inner life, the spirit world is regarded as an external environment for spirits. Although independent from the natural world, both the spirit world and the natural world are in constant interaction. Through mediumship, these worlds can consciously communicate with each other. The spirit world is sometimes described by mediums from the natural world in trance.Hill, p.44 History By the mid-19th century most Spiritualist writers concurred that the spirit world was of \\"tangible substance\\" and a place consisting of \\"spheres\\" or \\"zones\\".Hill, p.36 Although specific details differed, the construct suggested organization and centralization. An 18th century writer, Emanuel Swedenborg, influenced Spiritualist views of the spirit world. He described a series of concentric spheres each including a hierarchical organization of spirits in a setting more earth-like than theocentric.Carrol, p.17 The spheres become gradually more illuminated and celestial. Spiritualists added a concept of limitlessness, or infinity to these spheres.Edmonds, p.123 Furthermore, it was defined that Laws initiated by God apply to earth as well as the spirit world.Edmonds, p.136 Another common Spiritualist conception was that the spirit world is inherently good and is related to truth-seeking as opposed to things that are bad residing in a \\"spiritual darkness\\".Hill, p.168Edmonds, p.143 This conception inferred as in the biblical parable Lazarus and Dives that there is considered a greater distance between good and bad spirits than between the dead and the living.Hill, p.208 Also, the spirit world is \\"The Home of the Soul\\" as described by C. W. Leadbeater (Theosophist) suggesting that for a living human to experience the spirit world is a blissful, meaningful and life changing experience.Colville, pp.268‚Äì270 Yet, John Worth Edmonds stated in his 1853 work, Spiritualism, \\"Man's relation spiritually with the spirit-world is no more wonderful than his connection with the natural world. The two parts of his nature respond to the same affinities in the natural and spiritual worlds.\\"Edmonds, p.104 He asserted, quoting Swedenborg through mediumship, that the relationship between man and the spirit world is reciprocal and thus could contain sorrow.

He joined professional sumo in 2000. His highest rank was maegashira 14, achieved in 2006. After illness saw him demoted to the third makushita division in 2008, he returned to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in 2010 and the top makuuchi division in September 2011. After winning the Sandanme division he had just been demoted to in November 2013, he chose to retire. He is now a coach at Sakaigawa stable. Career 150px He was born in the city of Hirosaki (as was Wakanosato). H≈çchiyama was a member of Kizukuri High School sumo club (also attended by Mainoumi) and he made his professional debut in March 2000. He joined the Nakadachi stable set up by former komusubi Ryogoku, which was subsequently renamed Sakaigawa stable. H≈çchiyama took the jonokuchi championship with a perfect 7-0 record in his first tournament as a rikishi and he earned promotion to sandanme in November 2000 with another 7-0 score. However he found his opponents in the third makushita division much more difficult to deal with and his progress slowed. He narrowly missed out on promotion to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division a number of times, recording 3-4 marks at makushita 1 in July 2004 and November 2005. After 24 tournaments in the third division he finally achieved promotion in January 2006 when a 4-3 score at makushita 4 was enough to reach j≈´ry≈ç. He became the second member of his stable to reach sekitori status, following Iwakiyama, and the first to do it progressing through all the professional sumo divisions, Iwakiyama having made his debut in makushita. H≈çchiyama reached the top makuuchi division in only in three tournaments, after winning the j≈´ry≈ç championship in July 2006 with a 13-2 record. He could only manage five wins in his top division debut in September 2006 and was demoted back to j≈´ry≈ç. He reappeared in makuuchi in May 2007 but after two more make-koshi or losing scores he fell back to the second division once again in September of that year. He just missed out on immediate promotion back to the top division after recording seven wins against eight losses at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 1. However, restricted by diabetes, a disastrous performance of 2-13 at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 6 in the March 2008 tournament (which was his sixth consecutive losing score) saw him demoted to the third division for May. After more than two years in makushita, he finally returned to the sekitori ranks in July 2010 after scoring 5-2 at the rank of makushita 1 West in May. He came through with a winning record of 8-7, securing his kachi-koshi on the final day after four straight losses. He was one of seven rikishi from Sakaigawa stable ranked in j≈´ry≈ç in September 2010, the others being Iwakiyama, Goeido, Toyohibiki, Sadanoumi, Sadanofuji and Shironoryu. After a solid 9-6 at Juryo 5 in July 2011, he was promoted back to the top division for September after a 23 tournament absence - the fourth longest ever. He scored only 5-10 on his return and was immediately demoted back to juryo, but he ensured with an 8-7 score at Juryo 1 in January 2012 that he was promoted to makuuchi once again for the March 2012 tournament. However he failed in his fifth attempt at a top division kachi-koshi, finishing on 4‚Äì11. In his sixth and final appearance in makuuchi he fared even worse, only scoring 1‚Äì14. He is the only wrestler in the modern era of sumo to have six top division tournaments without a kachi-koshi. Retirement from sumo In November 2013, after dropping to the sandanme division for the first time since the beginning of his career, H≈çchiyama managed to take the championship. He still chose to retire before the beginning of the following January 2014 tournament. He had been suffering from chronic lower back pain and diabetes. He has remained in sumo as a coach under the toshiyori or elder name of Kimgahama Oyakata. He had 29 tournaments at a sekitori rank; normally 30 are required to become an oyakata but Hochiyama was allowed because his stablemaster and previous owner of the stock acted as guarantors, under new Sumo Association rules brought in on November 17, 2013.

While reaching out with their message of equality and acceptance to all people in Jerusalem, Palestine and abroad, their main focuses are community building, providing humanitarian services and promoting social change. They work to create a safe, pluralistic and egalitarian Jerusalem that is welcoming to all of its inhabitants, communities and visitors, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Activities The Jerusalem Open House was founded in 1997. Since then, it has been an essential pillar in the queer community of Jerusalem. JOH founded the first LGBT health clinic in Israel ‚Äì the Open Clinic ‚Äì and now also offers subsidized counseling through the Open Counseling. The open house includes many different group meetings, as well as a comprehensive youth. Additionally, the JOH annual Jerusalem Pride marches organized by the center have become the largest human-rights demonstrations in Jerusalem, and has been put on annually since 2002. In 2006, the JOH hosted WorldPride. = The Community Center = The Jerusalem Open House in the only LQBTQ community center in Jerusalem, and its greater area. It is open daily from 12pm-4pm for anyone seeking out a safe space. Visitors can enjoy sitting areas, a kitchen and a library. The JOH staff is ready to guide and to assist if needed. In this same space many of the educational groups meet. In total there are more than 20 different social groups at JOH, each coordinated by a trained volunteer. Community members also gather in the JOH for special events, joint holidays, activities, workshops, poetry nights and lectures. The JOH offers ongoing community celebrations, mostly around holidays. The center also organizes meetings and events for people of all religious denominations, including a social group for Orthodox gay men. In addition, JOH supports exchanges with LGBT synagogues abroad. JOH has also hosted family friendly gatherings for Purim. = Education = JOH offers services specifically for youth living in the area around Jerusalem, including doing outreach in schools. Beyond youth groups, there are adult groups including a group of English speakers, Arabic speakers, senior women, and senior men. The Jerusalem Open House runs the program \\"More le Haim\\" which was founded in the memory of Shira Banki, after the hate crimes at the annual Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance in 2015, which resulted in her death. Our education team and volunteers conduct educational seminars around the city, reaching thousands of school pupils, teachers and counsellors, soldiers and civic organizations in Jerusalem. The mission of the program is to educate and to create a more tolerant, welcoming and aware environment for LGBTQ youth. The program includes 170 presentations annually and is rooted in the concept of engendering empathy through personal narratives and conversation about LGBTQ related issues. =Health services= In 2008, JOH opened a clinic which offers anonymous HIV testing and counseling to anyone. The clinic can also prescribe post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Additionally, the JOH provides low cost counseling through its Open Counseling Services. Open Counseling is a psycho-social service unit with a team of 12 therapists and social workers who offer individual, family, and group treatments at subsidized prices and in a safe, accepting environment. JOH also provides social workers who are able to guide and support LGBTQ at- risk youth and teenagers day-to-day and in emergency situations. The Open Counseling professional staff provides training, workshops and seminars on LGBTQ and therapy related issues and works to improve the wellbeing of Jerusalem's LGBTQ community. =Advocacy= The JOH takes action on a variety of issues concerning the LGBT community through campaigning and advocacy. Current campaigns include efforts to convince the Rabbinical School of the Conservative movement to accept LGBT people into its Rabbinical program in Israel; to achieve recognition for LGBT victims of the Holocaust and their inclusion in Israel's national Holocaust memorial ceremonies; and to protest against conversion therapy. =Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance= Jerusalem Pride 2018 In 2002, JOH sued the city of Jerusalem for not allowing them to have a pride parade. The JOH won this case, and the city of Jerusalem paid the group the equivalent of 10,000 USD in settlement. Since, the JOH has organized the annual pride parades in Jerusalem under the name \\"Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance.\\" In 2005, a municipal ban attempted to halt the parade, but it was overturned by a district court order. Protesters, many of them religious Jews, lined the mile-long parade route shouting insults and displaying signs with messages like: \\"You are corrupting our children,\\" and \\"Jerusalem is not San Francisco.\\" During the parade, Yishai Schlissel, a Haredi Jew, stabbed three parade participants with a kitchen knife. During a police interrogation, he described the motive behind his actions: \\"I came to murder on behalf of God. We can't have such abomination in the country.\\" The perpetrator was subsequently convicted of three counts of attempted murder and sentenced to 12 years in prison. The Jerusalem District Court also ordered that NIS 280 million (about US$60 million) be paid as compensation to the victims. Schlissel was released in 2015 and returned to the Pride Parade in 2015 to attack again. The 2006 Pride parade was also steeped in controversy. Radical right-wing activists Hillel Weiss, Baruch Marzel and Itamar Ben-Gvir declared a \\"holy war\\" against those participating in the Parade and announced that unless the parade was cancelled, violence would ensue. The Parade's coordinators filed a complaint, accusing them of incitement to murder. A week before the parade violent rioting broke out in the Haredi neighborhood of Mea Shearim. Seven policemen and a number of unknown protesters were wounded. However, the parade proceeded without incident. In 2015, six people were stabbed at the parade by Schlissel, the same perpetrator of the 2005 stabbing. This stabbing resulted in the death of Shira Banki, who was 16 years old. Schlissel has since been sentenced to life in prison for six counts of attempted murder. Despite threats, violence and challenges from conservative parties and aggressors, the March for Pride and Tolerance continues to be put on each year. As the city's largest human rights event, involving many thousands of marchers, the Pride March enables participants to shape the contemporary face of Jerusalem and publicly support LGBTQ people's struggle for full rights, and life without prejudice in their city. Prior to the Pride March, the month of July is filled with daily events, lectures, workshops and parties celebrating Pride and Tolerance in Jerusalem.  Controversy  The JOH has been involved in some controversy, both within Israel and in the United States. In 2014, the JOH was erroneously linked to the killing of Muhammad Abu Khdeir. There was a rumor that Khdeir had been a member of JOH and that was the reason for his murder. JOH claimed that this was not true and the group reiterated that they want peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The group has had Palestinian members since 2001, although Palestinians have been forming their own groups since around 2007. In 2016, a Shabbat service planned by A Wider Bridge and in which JOH participated as part of the National LGBTQ Task Force's Creating Change Conference was first cancelled, then un-cancelled, and finally protested against by anti-Israeli protesters in Chicago. Protestors accused the groups of pinkwashing and physically disrupted a presentation that JOH members were giving about the attack at the 2015 Jerusalem March for Pride and Tolerance.

() was a military commander of the H√≤a H·∫£o religious sect, which operated from the Mekong Delta and controlled various parts of southern Vietnam during the 1940s and early 1950s. Ba C·ª•t and his forces fought the Vietnamese National Army (VNA), the Vi·ªát Minh, and the Cao ƒê√†i religious movement from 1943 until his capture in 1956. Known for his idiosyncrasies, he was regarded as an erratic and cruel leader who fought with little ideological purpose. His sobriquet came from the self-amputation of his left index finger (although it was erroneously reported that it was his middle or \\"third cut finger\\"). He later swore not to cut his hair until the communist Vi·ªát Minh were defeated. Ba C·ª•t frequently made alliances with various Vietnamese factions and the French. He invariably accepted the material support offered in return for his cooperation, and then broke the agreement‚Äînevertheless, the French made deals with him on five occasions. The French position was weak because their military forces had been depleted by World War II, and they had great difficulty in re-establishing control over French Indochina, which had been left with a power vacuum after the defeat of Japan. In mid-1955, the tide turned against the various sects, as Prime Minister Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám of the State of Vietnam and his VNA began to consolidate their grip on the south. Ba C·ª•t and his allies were driven into the jungle, and their position was threatened by government offensives. After almost a year of fighting, Ba C·ª•t was captured. He was sentenced to death and publicly beheaded in C·∫ßn Th∆°. Early life and background alt=A young slim man aged around 20, with sharp eyes and nose, wearing a cylindrical traditional Vietnamese cloth headpiece and tunic. Both the headpiece and tunic are black. Ba C·ª•t was born circa 1923 in Long Xuy√™n, a regional town in the Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned at an early age and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba C·ª•t was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord,Tai, p. 130. the father of Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°. Ba C·ª•t's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Th∆° rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and played a key role in Ba C·ª•t's eventual capture and execution.Tai, p. 196. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba C·ª•t during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba C·ª•t became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, his father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba C·ª•t severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.Tr·∫ßn, L√™ Quang Vinh Vietnam was a tumultuous place during Ba C·ª•t's youth, particularly in the Mekong Delta. In 1939, Hu·ª≥nh Ph√∫ S·ªï founded the H√≤a H·∫£o religious movement, and within a year had gained more than 100,000 followers. He drew adherents for two reasons: the prophecies he made about the outbreak of World War II and the conquest of South-East Asia by Japan, which proved to be correct; and his work as a mystical healer‚Äîhis patients claimed to have been miraculously cured from all manner of serious illnesses after seeing him, when Western medicine had failed.Buttinger, p. 255.Karnow, pp. 158‚Äì59. S·ªï's cult-like appeal greatly alarmed the French colonial authorities.Fall, pp. 151‚Äì52. During World War II, Imperial Japan invaded and seized control of Vietnam from France; its defeat and withdrawal at the end of the war in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country.Karnow, pp. 155‚Äì59. The H√≤a H·∫£o formed their own army and administration during the war, and started a de facto state in their Mekong Delta stronghold. They came into conflict with the Cao ƒê√†i, another new religious movement, which also boasted a private army and controlled a nearby region of southern Vietnam around T√¢y Ninh.Karnow, pp. 147, 158‚Äì59. Meanwhile, in Saigon, the B√¨nh Xuy√™n organised crime syndicate ruled much of the city through its gangster militia.Jacobs, pp. 54, 61. These three southern forces vied for control of southern Vietnam with the main protagonists: the French, who were attempting to re-establish colonial control across the entire nation; and the communist-dominated Vi·ªát Minh, who sought Vietnamese independence. At the time, the many groups vying for power‚Äîincluding their respective factions‚Äîengaged in alliances of convenience that were frequently broken. Historian David Elliott wrote: \\"[T]he most important eventual cause of the French decline was the inherently unstable nature of the political alliances they had devised ... [T]he history of the French relations with the Hoa Hao sect is a telling illustration of the pitfalls of short-term political deals between forces whose long-term interests conflict.\\"Elliott, p. 73. The H√≤a H·∫£o initially engaged in large- scale clashes with the Vi·ªát Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 the two groups had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, S·ªï became estranged from his military leaders and started the D√¢n X√£ (Social Democratic Party). Because of his charisma, the Vi·ªát Minh saw S·ªï as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the H√≤a H·∫£o leaderless and causing S·ªï's military leaders to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in violence as the various H√≤a H·∫£o factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.Elliott, p. 74. Career Ba C·ª•t joined the H√≤a H·∫£o militia when it was formed in 1943‚Äì44, and became a commander within a year. He was feared by his enemies, and was described as \\"a sort of lean Rasputin\\"Buttinger, p. 654. who claimed to be immortal. According to historian and writer Bernard Fall, \\"The hapless farmers who were under the rule of the maniacal Ba Cut fared worse [than those under other military leaders], for the latter [Ba C·ª•t] was given to fits of incredible cruelty and had no sense of public duty.\\"Fall, pp. 153‚Äì57. American journalist Joseph Alsop described Ba C·ª•t as \\"war- drunk\\".Hammer (1955), p. 348. Ba C·ª•t was famous for inventing a torture contraption that drilled a steel nail through the victim's ear,Moyar, p. 65 a device he used to extort villagers and wealthy landlords to fund his forces.Lansdale, p. 152. He was said to have \\"arranged temporary marriages between his troops and village girls\\". He raised a large amount of funds for the H√≤a H·∫£o and himself personally by charging traders and landlords high prices to stop pirates in the local area. The severed heads of the pirates were subsequently impaled on stakes and put on public display.Blagov, p. 41. In 1947, he led his own faction of the sect after its various military leaders pursued their own policies towards the French and H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's Vi·ªát Minh in the wake of S·ªï's death. At the time, France was in a ruinous financial state following World War II and was experiencing great difficulty in its attempts to re-establish control over its colonies.Karnow, p. 203. Ba C·ª•t had only 1,000 men in five battalions at the time, fewer than 5% of H√≤a H·∫£o forces, whereas Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn So√°i had 15,000 men. The French tried to maintain their hold with a divide and conquer strategy towards the H√≤a H·∫£o.Blagov, p. 49. They coaxed So√°i into joining with them and recognised him as the leader of the H√≤a H·∫£o. In 1948, Ba C·ª•t rallied to the French and So√°i, but broke away again soon after, relocating to ƒê·ªìng Th√°p Province and resuming his military activities against the French. In 1950, Ba C·ª•t was involved in a battle with another H√≤a H·∫£o leader, Nguy·ªÖn Gi√°c Ng·ªô. He was defeated and driven from the district of Ch·ª£ M·ªõi in February, provoking So√°i to attack Ngo. Ba C·ª•t then moved to Th·ªët N·ªët and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there. The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the H√≤a H·∫£o and gain an anti-Vi·ªát Minh ally, and offered material aid, which Ba C·ª•t accepted. Ba C·ª•t repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Vi·ªát Minh in return for arms and money, but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao ƒê√†i instead of the communists. He made five such deals with the French, but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time.Buttinger, p. 1064. It was said that Ba C·ª•t sometimes broke away with the encouragement of So√°i, who was still allied to the French, but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba C·ª•t weapons to fight the French.Blagov, p. 50. The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment. Some historians have claimed Ba C·ª•t's anti-French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident. There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French.Blagov, p. 51. The other H√≤a H·∫£o commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba C·ª•t; they were stridently opposed to the Vi·ªát Minh due to S·ªï's assassination, and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French, but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack.Tai, p. 164. The most notable instance of Ba C·ª•t's abandoning the fight against the Vi·ªát Minh came in mid-1953. At that time, his forces had been helping to defend the regional Mekong Delta town of M·ªπ Tho, but the French decided to transfer more of the military power to their more mainstream allies, the Vietnamese National Army (VNA). As the French tried to undermine his position, tensions with Ba C·ª•t increased. On 25 June, the H√≤a H·∫£o leader ordered his men to evacuate their French-supplied bases; they took their weapons with them and razed the camps. Ba C·ª•t then withdrew his forces from a string of military posts in the Plain of Reeds and retreated to Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc in the extreme south of the country.Elliott, p. 79. As a result, the French- aligned presence in the Mekong Delta was severely dented and the Vi·ªát Minh made substantial gains in the area.Elliott, p. 81. Eventually, the French defeat at ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß in May 1954 signaled the end of French Indochina.Jacobs, pp. 38‚Äì43. When the Geneva Conference in July 1954 ended the First Indochina War, it handed North Vietnam to H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh's Vi·ªát Minh, and the south to the State of Vietnam. To reunify the country, national elections were scheduled for 1956, following which the French would withdraw from Indochina.Jacobs, p. 40. The partition of Vietnam angered Ba C·ª•t and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Vi·ªát Minh since 1947, Ba C·ª•t's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Di·ªám had been too passive in rejecting the partition, and that half of the country should not have been yielded to the communists.Warner, pp. 105‚Äì07. In mid-1954, General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh, the head of the State of Vietnam's VNA, announced that he did not respect the leadership of Prime Minister Di·ªám, and vowed to overthrow him. The coup never materialised and Hinh was forced into exile,Jacobs, p. 62. but not before appointing Ba C·ª•t to the rank of colonel in the VNA in an attempt to undermine Di·ªám, as the H√≤a H·∫£o warlord was openly contemptuous of the prime minister.Lansdale, p. 148. In August, Ba C·ª•t and his 3,000 men broke from the VNA and left their Th·ªët N·ªët base for the jungle, and fought against those who had briefly been their comrades; this put him at odds with most H√≤a H·∫£o leaders, who accepted government payments to integrate their forces into the VNA.Buttinger, p. 1104.Blagov, p. 86. Operation Ecaille,Blagov, p. 87. the initial military offensive by the VNA against Ba C·ª•t was a failure, possibly because the details of the planned attack on his forces were leaked to him by So√°i, a H√≤a H·∫£o member of the National Defence Committee.Jacobs, p. 84. During the transition period between the signing of the Geneva Accords and the planned reunification elections, South Vietnam remained in chaos as the VNA tried to subdue the remaining autonomous factions of the H√≤a H·∫£o, Cao ƒê√†i, and B√¨nh Xuy√™n militias. In early 1955, during a battle with the Cao ƒê√†i forces of Tr√¨nh Minh Th·∫ø, after a dispute over control of the That Son region, Ba C·ª•t was wounded in a disputed incident. Th·∫ø claimed to have tried initiating peace talks with Ba C·ª•t, but received no reply, so he decided to try to capture his rival. He sent some of his militant disciples to infiltrate Ba C·ª•t's forces and try to capture the H√≤a H·∫£o leader. When they located Ba C·ª•t and surrounded him, he refused to surrender but instead tried to shoot his way out. Ba C·ª•t was severely wounded by a bullet that penetrated his chest. It seemed that he would die, but a French Air Force helicopter flew in and airlifted him to a colonial hospital. He recovered but in the interim the fighting stopped.Lansdale, p. 199. Another account claims the two military leaders had been on good terms and exchanging diplomatic missions, but that the skirmish was caused by one of Ba C·ª•t's aides addressing the envoy in an abrasive and rude manner, and that the injuries were minor. Yet another account holds that the reaction by Th·∫ø's envoy was premeditated and that the claim the firing was in response to rudeness was merely a cover for an assassination attempt. According to this theory, Th·∫ø, whose units were then being integrated into Di·ªám's VNA, had given orders to target Ba C·ª•t. This was allegedly done on the orders of CIA agent Edward Lansdale, who was trying to help secure Di·ªám in power at the time. Lansdale has been accused of failing in an earlier attempt to bribe Ba C·ª•t to cease his activities. By this time, with France preparing to withdraw from Indochina, senior French officers had begun to undermine Di·ªám's leadership and his attempts to stabilise South Vietnam.Jacobs, pp. 70‚Äì78. The VNA later implicated the French in the organisation of weapons air drops to Ba C·ª•t, prompting a protest from Di·ªám's government.Lansdale, p. 222. Di·ªám complained to a French general, alleging that Ba C·ª•t's men were using French equipment that was of higher quality than that given to the VNA.Lansdale, pp. 313‚Äì15. The H√≤a H·∫£o accused Di·ªám of treachery in his negotiations with various groups. They charged the prime minister with integrating Th·∫ø's forces into the VNA in return for them being allowed to attack Ba C·ª•t with the aid of the VNA, and that this part of the deal had been kept secret. They warned that other H√≤a H·∫£o leaders who had stopped fighting could join Ba C·ª•t, and appealed to Di·ªám's U.S. sponsors. In response, Ba C·ª•t ambushed a VNA unit in Long M·ªπ, killing three officers and injuring some thirty men.Blagov, p. 94. Last stand against Di·ªám alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. In 1955, Di·ªám tried to integrate the remaining H√≤a H·∫£o armies into the VNA. Ba C·ª•t was one of four H√≤a H·∫£o military leaders who refused the government offer on 23 April,Buttinger, pp. 888‚Äì89. and continued to operate autonomously.Moyar, p. 49. At one stage, the Cao ƒê√†i, H√≤a H·∫£o and B√¨nh Xuy√™n formed an alliance called the United Front, in an attempt to pressure Di·ªám into handing over power;Jacobs, p. 70. Ba C·ª•t was named senior military commander.Lansdale, pp. 246‚Äì47. However, this had little meaning as the various units were still autonomous of each other, and the United Front was more a showpiece than a means of facilitating coordinated action, and did not in any way strengthen any military threat to Di·ªám. The leaders were suspicious of one another and often sent subordinates to meetings.Blagov, pp. 104‚Äì05. Initially, American and French representatives in Vietnam hoped that Di·ªám would take up a ceremonial role and allow the sect leaders‚Äîincluding Ba C·ª•t‚Äîto hold government positions.Lansdale, p. 252. However, Di·ªám refused to share power and launched a sudden offensive against Ba C·ª•t in Th·ªët N·ªët on 12 March, shelling the area heavily. The battle was inconclusive and both sides blamed the other for causing instability and disrupting the situation.Blagov, pp. 107‚Äì08. Di·ªám then attacked the B√¨nh Xuy√™n's Saigon headquarters in late April, quickly crushing them.Jacobs, pp. 72‚Äì77. During the fighting, the H√≤a H·∫£o attempted to help the B√¨nh Xuy√™n by attacking towns and government forces in their Mekong Delta heartland. Ba C·ª•t's men, who had also been angered by the recent arrest of some colleagues, blockaded the Mekong and Bassac rivers and laid siege to various towns, including Sa ƒê√©c, Long Xuy√™n and Ch√¢u ƒê·ªëc, stifling the regional economy.Blagov, p. 126. The H√≤a H·∫£o shut down several important regional roads and stopped the flow of agricultural produce from the nation's most fertile region into the capital, causing food prices to rise by 50%,Blagov, p. 131. as meat and vegetables became scarce. Ba C·ª•t then attacked a battalion of VNA troops south of Sa ƒê√©c. Soon after, they retreated to a H√≤a H·∫£o citadel on the banks of the Bassac. After reinforcing their base, the H√≤a H·∫£o proceeded to fire mortars across the water into the city of C·∫ßn Th∆°, which stood on the opposite side of the river. During this period, the United Front publicly accused Di·ªám of trying to bribe Ba C·ª•t with 100 million piasters,Blagov, p. 141. to which the H√≤a H·∫£o responded with a series of attack on outposts and blasts to destroy bridges.Chapman (2013), p. 125. With the B√¨nh Xuy√™n vanquished, Di·ªám turned his attention to conquering the H√≤a H·∫£o. As a result, a battle between government troops led by General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and Ba C·ª•t's men commenced in C·∫ßn Th∆° on 5 June. Five H√≤a H·∫£o battalions surrendered immediately; Ba C·ª•t and three remaining leaders had fled to the Cambodian border by the end of the month. Having surrendered his forces, Ngo excoriated Soai and Ba C·ª•t, claiming that their activities were not consistent with H√≤a H·∫£o religious practices and accused them of fighting with communists.Chapman (2013), p. 126. The soldiers of the three other leaders eventually surrendered, but Ba C·ª•t's men continued to the end, claiming loyalty to the Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. Di·ªám responded by replacing the officers of B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i's personal regiments with his own men and used the royal units to attack Ba C·ª•t's rebels near H√† Ti√™n and R·∫°ch Gi√°, outnumbering the H√≤a H·∫£o by at least a factor of five.Blagov, p. 203. Knowing that they could not defeat the government in open conventional warfare, Ba C·ª•t's forces destroyed their own bases so that the VNA could not use their abandoned resources, and retreated into the jungle.Moyar, pp. 53‚Äì54. Ba C·ª•t's 3,000 men spent the rest of 1955 evading 20,000 VNA troops who had been deployed to quell them, notwithstanding a A bounty of one million piasters was put on the head of Ba C·ª•t, who scattered trails of money in the jungle, hoping to distract his pursuers, but to no avail. The communists claimed in a history written decades later that Ba C·ª•t had tried to forge an alliance with them, but that talks broke down a few months later.Blagov, p. 206. Despite his weak military situation, Ba C·ª•t sought to disrupt the staging of a fraudulent referendum that Di·ªám had scheduled to depose B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i as head of state.Jacobs, p. 95. Ba C·ª•t distributed a pamphlet condemning Di·ªám as an American puppet, asserting that the prime minister was going to \\"Catholicize\\" the country;Chapman (2006), p. 701. the referendum was partly funded by the U.S. government and various Roman Catholic organisations.Chapman (2006), p. 700. Di·ªám had strong support from American Roman Catholic politicians and the powerful Cardinal Francis Spellman and his elder brother, Pierre Martin Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Th·ª•c, was Archbishop of Hu·∫ø.Jacobs, pp. 20‚Äì35. Ba C·ª•t presciently noted that the referendum was a means \\"for Diem to gather the people from all towns and force them to demonstrate one goal: to depose Bao Dai and proclaim the puppet Diem as the chief-of-state of Vietnam.\\" On the day of the poll, Ba C·ª•t's men prevented voting in the border regions which they controlled,Buttinger, pp. 890‚Äì92. and ventured out of the jungles to attack polling stations in C·∫ßn Th∆°.Chapman (2006), p. 698. Despite that disruption, Di·ªám was fraudulently credited with more than 90% of support in H√≤a H·∫£o-controlled territory, and a near unanimous turnout was recorded in the area.Moyar, p. 55.Fall, p. 257. These results were replicated across the nation, and Di·ªám deposed B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i. Eventually, Ba C·ª•t was surrounded, and sought to make a peace deal with the Di·ªám government to avoid being taken prisoner. Ba C·ª•t sent a message to Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, the public official who oversaw the civilian side of the campaign against the H√≤a H·∫£o, asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Th∆° agreed to meet Ba C·ª•t alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a H√≤a H·∫£o trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba C·ª•t began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate.Lansdale, p. 322. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba C·ª•t's lifelong antipathy towards Th∆°'s family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba C·ª•t was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.Doyle, p. 131. Contemporary political commentators based in France and Vietnam saw his capture as the death knell for domestic military opposition to President Di·ªám, while US Embassy official Daniel Anderson speculated that defeat of \\"the most able and spectacular leader\\" of the sects would lead to a collapse in non- communist armed opposition.Chapman (2013), p. 142. Trial and execution alt=Dishevelled man dressed in white folds his arms as he stands in the dock. He is guarded by two soldiers, one with a machine gun. The courtroom is crowded. Initially, American commentators and observers thought that Di·ªám might try a reconciliatory approach and integrate Ba C·ª•t into the mainstream to increase the appeal of his government, rather than punish the H√≤a H·∫£o leader. They felt that Ba C·ª•t had a high level of military skill and popular appeal that could be used in favour of the government, citing his colourful \\"Robin Hood\\" image as an attraction with the rural populace. US officials were also worried that a harsh punishment such as the death penalty could provoke an anti-government backlash, and that it could be exploited by other opposition groups. However, Di·ªám saw Ba C·ª•t as contrary to Vietnamese values of struggle and self-sacrifice and felt that strong measures were required. Di·ªám's government put Ba C·ª•t on trial for treason, under Article 146 of the Military Code of the Republic of Vietnam. Di·ªám spoke out and accused Ba C·ª•t of rallying to and defecting from the central government four times from 1945 to 1954, and that at his peak in mid-1954, Ba C·ª•t commanded 3500 troops armed with 3200 firearms.Chapman (2013), p. 143. Ba C·ª•t was also accused of collaborating with the communists. The government submitted that the charge of treason was established by a series of attacks on VNA personnel, officers and vehicles from July 1954 until Ba C·ª•t's capture. The government prosecutor sought the death penalty and tendered petitions signed by residents of the Mekong Delta and southwestern Vietnam calling for the military destruction of Ba C·ª•t's militants. However, according to the historian Jessica Chapman, these petitions were organised by the government and heavily publicised in the Di√™m- controlled media, and not representative of public opinion. During the proceedings, Ba C·ª•t theatrically removed his shirt so that the public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. However, the Di·ªámist judge was unimpressed. Ba C·ª•t was found guilty of arson and multiple murders and sentenced to death on 11 June. An appeal was dismissed on 27 June. On 4 July, Ba C·ª•t was also found guilty in a military court and sentenced to death \\"with degradation and confiscation of his property\\". It was then fell to Di·ªám to consider a plea for clemency. Di·ªám rejected this and ordered the Justice Minister to put in place the orders for execution. On the very same day, a H√≤a H·∫£o lawyer lodged an appeal against all of the verdicts to the Supreme Appeals Court in Saigon, but the submissions were rejected in a matter of hours.Chapman (2013), p. 144. The H√≤a H·∫£o reacted strongly to the legal verdicts as \\"shameful and unjust\\". The D√¢n X√£ issued a statement describing the verdict and death penalty as being motivated by spite and being unsupported by evidence. Ba C·ª•t's defence counsel said the trial set a bad precedent for South Vietnam's fledgling legal system and questioned the integrity of the process. He claimed that VNA troops had engaged in mass rape and plunder of local civilians in their final push against Ba C·ª•t, and accused the Di·ªám regime of double standards in not investigating and prosecuting these alleged incidents. He claimed that South Vietnam had \\"no democracy and no freedom\\" and \\"only shamelessness and foolishness\\" and said that members of the H√≤a H·∫£o would continue to resist the Saigon administration politically and militarily. In addition, Di·ªám's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Di·ªám‚Äîwho had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President‚Äîand antagonise Ba C·ª•t's followers. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, Di·ªám's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba C·ª•t, who was compared to a character from the Wild West.Hammer (1987), p. 74. Ba C·ª•t was publicly guillotinedPham, p. 85. at 5:40 am on 13 July 1956, in a cemetery in C·∫ßn Th∆°. A crowd numbering in the hundreds, including members of Di·ªám's National Assembly, Minh, regional officials and both domestic and overseas journalists witnessed the beheading. Anderson believed the use of the guillotine, instead of a firing squad, as was normal for military executions, was used to emphasise that Ba C·ª•t's actions were being portrayed as common crimes rather than as political opposition. Chapman said that the dual military and civilian trial indicated that Di·ªám viewed any opposition activities as not only politically unacceptable but also as crimes related to bad character. Ba C·ª•t's body was later diced into small pieces, which were then buried separately. Some followers, led by a hardcore deputy named B·∫£y ƒê·ªõm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba C·ª•t was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Vi·ªát C·ªông‚Äîthe movement that succeeded the Vi·ªát Minh their leader had fought‚Äîand took up arms against Di·ªám.

Career For various record labels, he recorded 78rpm discs of parodies like \\"Cohen on the Telephone\\" and \\"Cohen Phones to His Friend Levy\\". Joe Hayman first recorded the monologue \\"Cohen on the Telephone\\" in London in July 1913 for Regal Records and released in the U.S. by Columbia Records. Lee De Forest recorded Silver doing \\"Cohen on the Telephone\\" for the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process. The film premiered as Monroe Silver, Famed Monologist with 17 other Phonofilm short films at the Rivoli Theater in New York City on 15 April 1923. This film is now in the Maurice Zouary collection at the Library of Congress. From 1925 to 1935, Silver appeared on The Goodrich Silvertown Orchestra radio show. With Silver's Jewish/Yiddish accent, words like \\"What are you doing?\\" came out as \\"Vot arrr you doink?\\" Some performers like Barney Bernard and Louis Mann tried to imitate him in the early 1920s, while Silver himself adapted the monologues of British vaudevillian Joe Hayman and others. Silver made many recordings with Billy Murray, as an Irish and Jewish dialect combo \\"Casey and Cohen\\". Their last recording together was on February 11, 1943 for Beacon Records.

She was the keytarist of Cobra Starship until their split in November 2015, and is currently recording as a solo artist under the name Vicky-T.http://www.vickyt.com Early life Asher is the daughter of Peter Asher, from the British pop duo Peter and Gordon, and Wendy Asher, who worked in the film business but is now a well known art collector/curator. Wendy can be seen in the Banksy film Exit Through the Giftshop. Asher attended high school with artist Shwayze and photographer Lauren Dukoff. She attended NYU to study film. During her time there, she worked for directors Michel Gondry and Terry Gilliam. She assisted on music videos like The White Stripes' \\"The Denial Twist\\" and Kanye West's \\"Heard 'Em Say\\", on the commercial \\"Nespresso... What Else?\\" featuring George Clooney, and on feature films The Science of Sleep and Be Kind Rewind. After finishing school she worked on the film A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints for a summer with Robert Downey Jr., who is a personal friend. In 2006, Gabe Saporta discovered her on Myspace.com after searching for female keyboardists in NYC. From there, she took a leave of absence from university to join Cobra Starship, and 18 at the time. She eventually graduated from New York University. Musical career In 2007, she and her Cobra Starship bandmates went on the Fall Out Boy headlined Honda Civic Tour, along with +44, The Academy Is..., and Paul Wall. She provided vocals in place of Carol Heller on +44's song ‚ÄúMake You Smile\\". In August of the same year, a rumor went around that she, Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump and Ashlee Simpson collaborated on a song that was on Asher's Myspace. Supposedly, Stump played bass and drums, and Simpson helped Asher with the lyrics. However, this rumor was proven false when Asher claimed that it was all a huge misunderstanding. During the Honda Civic Tour, Stump taught Asher how to use GarageBand, which, assumingly, helped her create the song. In the end, Asher made it clear in a blog entry on her Myspace page that she \\"just didn't want to leave anyone without credit\\". Cobra Starship took a break from touring and Asher used the free time to work for the company TCG Studios making main title sequences. She filmed and developed the opening title sequence for both Orange Is the New Black with director Thomas Cobb and the opening title sequences for Bitten, Homeland, Satisfaction and more. She also directed the music videos for Guilty Pleasure: Home Video, and \\"Kiss My Sass\\", along with many other music videos/online content for the band while touring. Other musical projects include a band called Optimo, which she formed with friends in Los Angeles, and a brief side project with Frank Staniszewski (keyboardist of Big City Rock) called NotInTown.

In his reign opened the island of Arwad on the coast of the Levant opposite the city of Tartus (Tartous today), and saved from the hands of the Crusaders Gang, the last of their positions in the Levant. In the second half of the month of Sha'ban of the same year (702 AH) the princes began to arrive from Egypt, and the tatar groups began to flow towards the country. Bilad al-Sham, the army fled from Aleppo and Hama towards Damascus, and the Tatars arrived in Homs and Baalbek, and met Sheikh Islam Ibn Taymiyah with the soldiers of Hama fleeing in Qatifah. Al-Assaker came out of Damascus on 24 Shaban and camped in Al-Kaswa, in order to avoid the city of Damascus, the desolation and the assault on children and the disabled men and the women's captivity, and because the lawn was too much water at that time is not suitable for fighting.

A cross section in McBride (1998) shows a high- angle normal fault that was correlated by Dokka (2006) with the Michoud fault. This fault merges with a low-angle detachment fault at ‚Äì7 km deep that developed along the top of a slightly south-dipping zone of weak salt and shale. These structures are considered to be related to a regional south- vergent extensional-contractional complex described by Peel et al. (1995; Fig. 1). Movement of the complex and thus on the Michaud fault reflects gravitational instabilities and down-dip motion during times of high sedimentation (Peel et al., 1995). The Michoud fault belongs to a class of geologic structures known as growth faults (Mauduit, T., Brun, J. P. 1998). Growth faults are common geologic structures of regions undergoing high sedimentation rates, such as river deltas and passive margins. They often develop where weak rock layers (detachments) such as salt, anhydrite, or shale underlie regions of rapid sedimentation. These weak zones allow the growing mass of material above them to slide downhill, either continuously or episodically. These downslope movements will be correspondingly experienced in the headwall region (such as that occupied by the Michoud fault) either as slow (barely perceptible) or rapid (catastrophic) subsidence. Growth faults are also sometimes called \\"listric faults\\", implying that the fault is a concave-upward surface that transforms nearly vertical displacements at the surface into nearly horizontal ones at depth. The Michoud fault is not unexpected or unusual as a geologic feature of the Mississippi River Delta. Holocene faulting and tilting is widely recognized in many world deltas, such as the Nile, the Ganges-Brahmaputra, the Yangtze, the Po River, and the Rhine.(T√∂rnqvist et al., 2006) References *Bebout, D.G., and Guti√©rrez, D.R., 1983, Regional cross sections, Louisiana Gulf Coast: Baton Rouge, Louisiana Geological Survey Folio Series 6, 10 p. *Dokka R.K., 2006.

History The land that Lynfield College now occupies used to be a poultry farm. This farm provided table fowls and eggs for the Auckland Area. The original name for the farm was Linfield. Alfred Bankhart established Lynfield on land gifted to him by Sir John Logan Campbell. Gilletta Road in Lynfield was named after Bankheart's wife's maiden name. Another Owner of the Property was Mr Irvine. He diversified from farming poultry to founding the giant baking and pastry firm Irvines Bakery. The on which the school now stands has seen a variety of activities - gum-digging, dairy farming, pig and poultry farming. In 1900 Messes Cooper and Mr Edwards began commercial strawberry growing. In 1911, Mr Cooper married and divided the land, keeping the half that bordered Boundary Road and Mr Edwards the other half which exited onto White Swan Road. In the 1950s, owners of the land sold portions to make way for Auckland's 20th Secondary School (to be possibly named Roskill South High School).There is a plough on the school's crest, to symbolise the use of the land it is located on as previously being a strawberry field.

Together with two retired schoolteachers, he borrowed the sum of CNY 140,000, to start producing milk drinks for distribution. He obtained independence from an early government partner by stressing his links with Danone. With his autocratic style and workaholic ethic, he built Wahaha into the largest beverage manufacturer in the People's Republic of China. The WHH joint venture entered into with Groupe Danone involved the inward investment of US$70 million in five joint venture companies in exchange for 51% Groupe Danone ownership in each company. The trademark agreement signed on 29 February 1996 gave the JVs the exclusive rights of production, distribution and sales of products under the Wahaha brand. Collaboration has grown into 39 joint venture entities by 2007. In 2007, the relationship turned sour.

Belarusians were active in the guerrilla movement against Napoleon's occupation and did their best to annihilate the remains of the Grande Arm√©e when it crossed the Berezina River in November 1812. With Napoleon's defeat, Belarus again became a part of Imperial Russia and its guberniyas constituted part of the Northwestern Krai. The anti-Russian uprisings of the gentry≈ªytko, Russian policy‚Ä¶, p551. in 1830 and 1863 were subdued by government forces.

A number of authors started publishing in the Belarusian language, including Jan Czeczot, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Syrokomla and Konstanty Kalinowski. In a Russification drive in the 1840s, Nicholas I forbade the use of the term Belarusia and renamed the region the \\"North-Western Territory\\". He also prohibited the use of Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded into a revolt, led by Kalinowski. After the failed revolt, the Russian government introduced the use of Cyrillic to Belarusian in 1864 and banned the use of the Latin alphabet.  Resistance after World War I  The territory claimed by the Belarusian People's Republic, 1918 World War I was the short period when Belarusian culture started to flourish. German administration allowed schools with Belarusian language, previously banned in Russia; a number of Belarusian schools were created until 1919 when they were banned again by the Polish military administration. At the end of World War I, when Belarus was still occupied by Germans, according to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the short-lived Belarusian People's Republic was pronounced on March 25, 1918, as part of the German Mitteleuropa plan. In December 1918, Mitteleuropa was obsolete as the Germans withdrew from the Ober Ost territory, and for the next few years in the newly created political vacuum the territories of Belarus would witness the struggle of various national and foreign factions. On January 2, 1919, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia was declared. Next month, it was disbanded. Part of it was included into Russian SFSR, and part was joined to the Lithuanian SSR to form the LBSSR, Lithuanian‚ÄìByelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, informally known as Litbel. While Belarus National Republic faced off with Litbel, foreign powers were preparing to reclaim what they saw as their territories: Polish forces were moving from the West, and Russians from the East. Eventually, it was the foreigners who prevailed. When the Red Army entered Minsk on January 5, 1919, the Rada (Council) of the Belarus National Republic went into exile, first to Kaunas, then to Berlin and finally to Prague. Several months later, in August, the Litbel was also dissolved, this time because of the pressure of Polish forces advancing from the West. Within the USSR, the name of the country was Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was declared on January 1, 1919 in Smolensk under the name of Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia (SSRB). Viaƒças≈Ça≈≠ Adamoviƒç (Wiaczes≈Çaw Adamowicz; pseudonym J. Dziergacz) planned and initiated military actions by Belarusian troops against the Soviets in Minsk and was also the founder of the partisan (military) unit, Zialony Dub (Green Oak). Some time in 1918 or 1919, Sergiusz Piasecki returned to Belarus, joining the anti-Soviet Zialony Dub, led by ataman Wiaczes≈Çaw Adamowicz. When on August 8, 1919 Polish Army troops captured Minsk, Adamowicz decided to cooperate with them. Thus, Belarusian units were created and Piasecki was transferred to Warsaw school of infantry cadets. In the summer of 1920, during Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, Piasecki fought in the Battle of Radzymin. The frontiers between Poland, which had established an independent government following World War I, and the former Russian Empire, were not recognized by the League of Nations. Poland's J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who envisioned a federation (Miƒôdzymorze), forming an East European bloc to form a bulwark against Russia and Germany, carried out Kiev Offensive into Ukraine in 1920, but was met by a Red Army counter-offensive that drove into Polish territory almost to Warsaw. However, Pi≈Çsudski halted the Soviet advance at the battle of Warsaw and resumed the offensive. Finally the Treaty of Riga, ending the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, divided Belarusian territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. For next two years BNR prepared for national uprising in Belarus and ceased the preparations only when the League of Nations recognised the eastern borders of Soviet Union on March 15, 1923. = External links = *–°—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Ç –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å–∫–∞–π —Å–µ–ª—è–Ω—Å–∫–∞–π –ø–∞—Ä—Ç—ãi ¬´–ó—è–ª—ë–Ω—ã –î—É–±¬ª  Resistance in World War II  Belarusian partisans near Po≈Çock, 1943.

When the Soviet Union invaded Poland on September 17, 1939, following the terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact's secret protocol, much of what had been eastern Poland was annexed to the BSSR. Similarly to the times of German occupation during World War I, Belarusian language and Soviet culture enjoyed relative prosperity in this short period. Already in October 1940, over 75% of schools used the Belarusian language, also in the regions where no Belarusian people lived, e.g. around ≈Åom≈ºa, there was Ruthenization.Ruchniewicz, Stosunki‚Ä¶, p254 After twenty months of Soviet rule, Germany and its Axis allies invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Soviet authorities immediately evacuated about 20% of the population of Belarus and destroyed all the food supplies.Mironowicz, p136 The country suffered particularly heavily during the fighting and the German occupation. Following bloody encirclement battles, all of the present-day Belarus territory was occupied by the Germans by the end of August 1941. During World War II, the Nazis attempted to establish a puppet Belarusian government, Belarusian Central Rada, with the symbolics similar to BNR. In reality, however, the Germans imposed a brutal racist regime, burning down some 9 000 Belarusian villages, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians more. Local police took part in many of those crimes. Almost the whole, previously very numerous, Jewish populations of Belarus that did not evacuate was killed. One of the first uprisings of a Jewish ghetto against the Nazis occurred in 1942 in Belarus, in the small town of Lakhva. Since the early days of the occupation, a powerful and increasingly well-coordinated Belarusian resistance movement emerged. Hiding in the woods and swamps, the partisans inflicted heavy damage to German supply lines and communications, disrupting railway tracks, bridges, telegraph wires, attacking supply depots, fuel dumps and transports and ambushing German soldiers. Not all anti-German partisans were pro- Soviet.Stru≈ºy≈Ñska, Anti-Soviet conspiracy‚Ä¶, pp859‚Äì860. In the largest partisan sabotage action of the entire Second World War, the so-called Osipowicze diversion of July 30, 1943, four German trains with supplies and Tiger tanks were destroyed. To fight partisan activity, the Germans had to withdraw considerable forces behind their front line. On June 22, 1944, the huge Soviet offensive Operation Bagration was launched, finally regaining all of Belarus by the end of August. Hundred thousand of Poles were expelled after 1944. As part of the Nazis' effort to combat the enormous Belarusian resistance during World War II, special units of local collaborationists were trained by the SS's Otto Skorzeny to infiltrate the Soviet rear. In 1944 thirty Belarusians (known as ƒåorny Kot (black cat) and personally led by Micha≈Ç Vitu≈°ka) were airdropped by the Luftwaffe behind the lines of the Red Army, which had already liberated Belarus during Operation Bagration. They experienced some initial success due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army, and some other German-trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest in 1945. The NKVD, however, had already infiltrated these units. Vitu≈°ka was hunted down, captured and executed. He continued to live on in Belarusian nationalist ideology.Perry Biddiscombe: The SS Hunter Battalions. The Hidden History of the Nazi Resistance Movement. Tempus, Stroud 2006, p. 66. In total, Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population in World War II, including practically all its intellectual elite. About 9 200 villages and 1.2 million houses were destroyed. The major towns of Minsk and Vitebsk lost over 80% of their buildings and city infrastructure. For the defence against the Germans, and the tenacity during the German occupation, the capital Minsk was awarded the title Hero City after the war. The fortress of Brest, Belarus was awarded the title Hero-Fortress.

Upon leaving the army in 1946 he joined Gillingham, who at the time were playing in the Kent League. Gillingham manager Archie Clark also signed four other players who had served with Boswell at Barton Stacey and played alongside him in the unit football team, namely Jackie Briggs, George Forrester, Hughie Russell and Vic Hole. Boswell missed only two matches during the 1946‚Äì47 season as Gillingham won the Kent League championship by a margin of one point. The following season the club played in the Southern Football League and Boswell was again a regular as the team finished in second place. In the 1948‚Äì49 season Gillingham won the Southern League championship. By the time the club was elected back into the Football League in 1950 Boswell had played over 100 times, and had become the team's captain. He remained one of the club's most consistent players until 1958, playing over 40 times in each season to take his total number of appearances to more than 500. He also played 36 times in the FA Cup, a club record. At the end of the 1957‚Äì58 season Boswell, now aged 36, left Gillingham to play for non-league team Gravesend & Northfleet. He later played for Tonbridge and Canterbury City before retiring. In 1964 he returned to Gillingham as team trainer, a position he held for five years. In January 1966 he took over as caretaker manager after the resignation of Freddie Cox, and guided the team to two victories before stepping down upon the arrival of new manager Basil Hayward. He also had a spell as manager of non-league Chatham Town, and coached the football team of the Kent Police. In later life he lived in the Lordswood area of Chatham, before moving to Stafford to be nearer relatives, where he died in 2010.

The treaty was negotiated between King Haakon and the Jarl of Sweden, Birger Magnusson, in the town of L√∂d√∂se, during the summer of 1249. The main purpose of the treaty was to prevent mutual hostility from escalating into war. Some factions of the Swedish nobility wanted to attack Norway in retribution for a raid by King Haakon, which had targeted Norwegian rebels in the Swedish province of V√§rmland 24 years earlier. In L√∂d√∂se, the two parties sworn that from then on fraternity and peace should prevail between the two kingdoms and that neither of the two would support or provide a haven for enemies of the other. It was also decided that Birger's daughter Rikissa, would marry the son of Haakon, Haakon the Young.  Background  The Nordic royal families were closely related during the Middle Ages, and the formation of different alliances constantly threatened stability in Scandinavia. All three kingdoms sought to prevent the other two from dominating the region. Domestic politics in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden was above all shaped by the struggle between different clans for possession of the throne. In Sweden, the House of Eric (supported by Denmark) and the House of Sverker (supported by Norway) had been contesting for power since the murder of King Sverker the Elder in 1156. Norway was at the time plagued by a prolonged civil war. Several pretenders to the throne were challenging King Haakon IV. Forces supporting the pretender Sigurd Ribbung used the Swedish province of V√§rmland as a safe haven for operations into Norway. Emissaries of the Norwegian king complained to the lawspeaker of V√§rmland and the Swedish king several times, but to no avail. Since the Swedes took no action against Ribbung, King Haakon led his army into V√§rmland during the winter of 1225. There he plundered the region in an attempt to quell Ribbung's rebellion. Haakon's incursion angered the Swedes, but because of their internal conflicts they were unable to retaliate. In 1229, the thirteen- year-old King Eric XI of Sweden was ousted from the throne by one of the members of his privy council, Canute II. After his supporters were overpowered at the Battle of Olustra in S√∂dermanland, Eric was forced to flee to Denmark. Following the battle, Canute declared himself King of Sweden. His reign was marked by unrest and violence. In the year 1234, Eric returned to Sweden and re-conquered the throne.  The treaty  After Eric was reinstated as king, some factions of the Swedish nobility advocated war with Norway. They wanted retribution for the Norwegian plundering of V√§rmland. According to the Norwegian saga Sverris saga, the future jarl Birger Magnusson, were among those in favour of war; however, at the time, the de facto ruler of Sweden Jarl Ulf Fase and his supporters were against attacking Norway. To prevent mutual hostility from escalating into war, Haakon IV of Norway sent an envoy to Sweden to conciliate. The Swedes agreed to talk, and a delegation led by Birger was sent to Kungah√§lla in Norway. Negotiations were held in the spring of 1241, however, no agreement was reached. In 1247, Sweden re-approached Norway, and a meeting between the two Kings was scheduled in the town of L√∂d√∂se in the province V√§sterg√∂tland for the summer of 1248. L√∂d√∂se was chosen as the meeting place because it was situated in the nearest Swedish province that could be reached by sea from Norway. The following year, Eric traveled to L√∂d√∂se at the scheduled time, but Haakon was delayed. Eric waited for Haakon, but was forced to leave when his supplies started running low. A new meeting, at the same place, was scheduled for the next year. In the summer of 1249, Eric returned to L√∂d√∂se, together with his brother-in-law Birger, who had by then become Jarl of Sweden. When the Swedes saw Haakon approaching L√∂d√∂se from the sea with a large fleet, they became scared and fled. Haakon sent a messenger bidding the Swedish king to come back and negotiate; however, the king was already in √ñsterg√∂tland and did not want to return. Instead, Birger Jarl, the de facto ruler, traveled back to L√∂d√∂se to negotiate with the Norwegian king. After negotiations, Birger Jarl and King Haakon came to an agreement and sworn that from then onward, fraternity and peace would prevail between the two kingdoms and that neither of the two would support or provide safe haven for enemies of the other. It was also decided that Birger's daughter, Rikissa Birgersdotter, would marry the son of Haakon, Haakon the Young.

Set mostly in northern Italy, close to Aquileia, it tells the story of the fate of a Langobard family as their homeland falls under the domination of Charlemagne. The major theme running through the book is the way the actions of the various characters are influenced by love, but also the difficulty of adapting to the arbitrary and overbearing power of absolute monarchy. The novel, translated into English by Elspeth Harley Schubert and published in 1968, is based somewhat on Charlemagne conquering northern Italy in 775. In its introductory remarks, Johnson acknowledges the historical plot, and his altering some dates. The central story follows the Lupigis family and the difficult fates they suffer following a rebellion against Emperor Charlemagne. The novel received the Nordic Council Literature Prize. It is assumed to have been of decisive importance for the Swedish Academy's decision to award Johnson the Nobel Prize for Literature.Nationalencyklopedin, \\"Eyvind Johnson\\" Plot Duke Rodgaud‚Äîcousin of Bertold, castle in Forojuli (contemporary name, Cividale, Italy), starts a rebellion against King Carolus, that is quickly put down. He is executed by the Franks in Papia, summer, 776. Angilperta (‚ÄúAngila‚Äù), the daughter of Rodgaud and Giseverga, is loved by the three Lupigi boys. She cannot be found during the rebellion, but becomes post- rebellion the wife of the Lord of East Burgundy, Gunderic, her name becoming Landoalda. She has Radbert as a lover, has two children, Landoald and Gisertruda, who die young, and a third child, Radaberta is given away. Gunderic imprisons her in the castle tower for seven years, after which Perto comes with an order from King Carolus to let her return to Forojuli. She dies on that trip back to her childhood home. Bertold Lupigi, cousin of Duke Rodgaud. The family name, Lupigi comes from wolf, loup. He disappears in the rebellion and is found in a dungeon. He is freed from prison, post-rebellion, in 793, but is killed by an avalanche. Perto, son of Liuta and Bertold, is 16 years old at the novel's beginning, the youngest of three brothers. He loves Angila. He is also named Johannes Lupigis, more so as the novel progresses. During the rebellion, he manages to escape the Franks who kill his friend Sinauld. He visits Angilperta with Agibert in the autumn of 783, and sleeps with Angilperta. Late autumn 783 he arrives in Aquisgranum, where there is a royal college. He meets King Carolus and decides he is ‚Äúindeed great.‚Äù Perto goes to Totonisvilla where his brother Warnefrit is in prison, but is seized by guards as he leaves the prison. In prison for three and a half years, in total darkness of the prison cell, he creates a vision of a flowering bush. Then he dines with the Devil, who tempts him. He is released from jail at the age of 31 and goes to Aquisgranum where his Uncle Anselm explains the reasons for his imprisonment. He becomes part of King Carolus's Court again, and eventually gets an order allowing Angilperta to return to her childhood home. Warnefrit, the son of Liuta and Bertold, the oldest of three brothers, likes relations with slave women. He becomes engaged to Angila.Ch. 12 All of chapter 16 is his angry and frustrated monologue as heir to his father. He disappears in the rebellion and is found in a dungeon, where he remains for over ten years post-rebellion. His brother Perto comes to get him from prison, though he does not recognize Perto. Eranbald brings Warnefrit to Gudneric, where Angilperta is, and they all dine together though Warnefrit does not seem to recognize Angilperta. Healthy again, he defends the kingdom against Huns.

Their best-known songs are \\"I'm in Pittsburgh (And it's Raining)\\", and \\"1523 Blair\\". Their recordings have been reissued on a number of compilation albums. According to the Ugly Things compilation album notes, they are the most recognized band of this name that were active in the mid-1960s, including another popular band from Manhasset, New York (see below for others). \\"Searchin' for Shakes\\" compilation album database, Ugly Things fanzine.  Early history  The Outcasts were formed in San Antonio in late 1963 by Buddy Carson, Rickey Wright and Denny Turner. In late 1964, Jim Carsten and then Jim Ryan joined the band.A 2002 posting on www.angelfire.com by Jim Ryan, a former bandmember. This line-up prevailed until the band's fifth single, when Galen Niles replaced Denny Turner on guitar. In 1964, Denny designed a logo and slogan for the band, \\"Music from the OUTER LIMITS\\", taken from the name of the popular science- fiction television series of the period, The Outer Limits. The band had the logo emblazoned on the backs of their uniforms and also issued business cards with a similar design. Early direction for the band came from Mike Post, whose many later musical credits include producing the first three albums for The First Edition and creating the theme music for Law & Order, The Rockford Files, Hill Street Blues and many other television series. Post was the songwriter and producer of the band's first single.Review from Fuzz, Acid and Flowers, partially reproduced on Denny Turner's website He also recruited the Outcasts as the back-up band for a performance by Jimmy Carlson (who was active in the New York folk music scene) and Jimmy Hawkins (who later worked in Elvis Presley films and on The Donna Reed Show).  Career  According to member Denny Turner, they had all of the trappings of a successful rock band: a succession of managers (Sally Senter and Major John Carson), go-go dancers, a fan club with a regular newsletter, and adoring fans. Their performances at area military clubs led to gigs as opening act for Herman's Hermits in San Antonio and Austin. In 1965, The Outcasts were even invited to appear in Houston, Texas with The Beatles. but turned down the opportunity; the Five Americans took their place at the concert. Ticket for an Outcasts show w/ 13th Floor Elevators In May 1966, they shared a bill with the 13th Floor Elevators (ticket pictured) and also appeared at Texas Teen Fairs and other venues with such popular acts as Lou Christie, Gerry and The Pacemakers, Peter and Gordon and The Rolling Stones.Denny Turner's website, op. cit. The Outcasts regularly participated in Battle of the Bands competitions, usually placing first or second; in 1966, the band won the competition statewide,Jim Ryan posting, op. cit. at the peak of garage rock fervor, beating the large number of bands that were then active in Texas. (No other state is so heavily collected today in compilation albums of garage rock and psychedelic rock music; as one example, the landmark Highs in the Mid-Sixties series devotes five of their twenty- three volumes to bands from Texas.)  Break-up and further activities  The band dissolved in 1968; founding member Buddy Carson died of complications of hepatitis that same year. *Denny Turner continues to write and record music, and he also sells and repairs vintage guitars for his store called Denny's Guitars, based in northern Oahu, Hawaii. He is also a multi-media artist and music teacher and has a home recording studio. *Jim Ryan is a public school music teacher in San Antonio who owns and manages Braindance Ink, a multi- lingual music production company specializing in the creation of songs, dances and games based on folk music for music education classes. *Galen Niles was the guitarist in two well-regarded Texas hard rock bands, Homer and Ultra during the 1970s and is still active in music. The Ultra tracks were reissued on Monster Records in 2000 and on Vintage Records in 2010. *Jim Carsten went into law enforcement and was once a county sheriff; he is now a security consultant. *Rickey Wright died in an automobile accident in 2000. Other bands named the Outcasts \\"The Outcasts\\", with various spelling variants, has been a fairly common name for rock bands for many years; at least 10 bands were using this name during the mid-1960s. This has led to some confusion among these varied groups. One common misconception has to do with the 1960s band The Outcasts from Manhasset, New York, whose recordings were reissued by the same Collectables label, even before they featured the Texas band. In the mid-1980s, Cicadelic Records released three archival albums by the New York group: Meet the Outcasts! (studio recordings, mostly previously unreleased), The Battle of the Bands Live! (split release) and Live! Standing Room Only (a 1967 concert). In 1993, Collectables reissued both albums on CD, with additional songs that include \\"Society's Child\\" and \\"Get It On\\". Popular recordings (reissued on compilations) of this band are \\"Don't Press Your Luck\\", \\"I Didn't Have to Love Her Anymore\\", \\"Nothing But Love\\", \\"Set Me Free\\" and their unique versions of \\"Walk On By\\" and \\"Gloria\\". Another band called the Outcasts recorded several tracks backing Linda Pierre King,Fuzz, Acid and Flowers, op. cit. an artist featured on a compilation of female garage rock artists from Texas, We Had the Beat / The Heartbeats & Other Texas Girls of the 60s. That album's liner notes suggested that the San Antonio band had backed her on these songs, a natural mistake, since King is from Houston, and the record label that released the final single by the Outcasts, Gallant Records, was based there. Songs The 1995 retrospective I'm in Pittsburgh and It's Raining (15 tracks, all the band's music on the Collectables label) omits the band's first single, Nothing Ever Comes Easy b/w Oriental Express; according to the CD's brief liner notes, it was \\"not up-to-par with their subsequent releases.\\"Liner notes, I'm in Pittsburgh and it's Raining CD Since neither side has yet been issued on a compilation album, we have only band member Jim Ryan's description: the first is \\"a very tender, yearning ballad with some nice changes and arrangement by a talented composer [Mike Post]. The B-side [is] a surf instrumental that rocked in fifths to give that Asian sound.\\" I'm in Pittsburgh (And it's Raining) embodied much of the innocence and charm of garage rock, as well as the less-than-slick production common of the 1960s garage sound. This was the band's most successful single, receiving national airplay and charting locally in San Antonio and also in Houston and Austin, Texas. The opening lyrics ‚Äì I'm in Pittsburgh and it's rainin' / I'm sittin' in the subway here complainin' ‚Äì contain an error of fact (Pittsburgh does not have a subway system), which cooled off the initial rush of record sales in that city. The title lyric was taken from Mountain's first lines of dialogue in the Rod Serling teleplay Requiem for a Heavyweight, the theatrical film version of which had been released three years before the song was composed. This track was included in the first of the Pebbles compilation albums, where the original liner notes call this song a \\"blistering punk- rocker, which has been compared to the Pretty Things at their best.\\" Numerous bands have released covers of this song over the years. Perhaps best known is the 1990 cover by The Cynics, from Pittsburgh; others have been recorded by the Flies, the Vibes and the Go-Devils. The original version of the song was re-pressed in 1977 as a bootleg recording in Amsterdam, and marketed to new wave fans, with the band name changed to the Kicks.Original liner notes, Pebbles, Volume 1 The band's last single, 1523 Blair features a \\"wind-up\\" introduction, followed by guitar riffs played at a furious pace, then barely intelligible lyrics, all at a blistering tempo. (The title was taken from the address of the Doyle Jones recording studio in Houston.) One recent reviewer remarked, \\"The music on this selection is jarringly experimental, the spirit is possessed fervor. '1523 Blair' is one minute and forty seven seconds long because it couldn‚Äôt have possibly been any longer\\".Posting on www.officenaps.com, February 5, 2007 This song inspired the name of a British psychedelic rock band, Blair 1523 (Bomp! Records released their lone album in 1993, after the band had already broken up). The Outcasts tried their hand at many styles, from protest songs (\\"Price of Victory\\"), blues (\\"Sweet Mary\\"), to instrumentals (\\"Come on Over\\" and \\"The Birds\\") and romantic ballads (\\"I'll Set You Free\\" and \\"Everyday\\"). The Outcasts also recorded covers, notably \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" and \\"Route 66\\".

He was an important figure in the German Christian movement during the early years of Nazi rule. During the war he became a senior official in the occupying government of the Soviet Union, achieving the rank of Generalkommissar for Weissruthenien (Belarus). He was assassinated in Minsk in 1943, triggering brutal reprisals against the citizens of Minsk. An extreme antisemite, he is known to have said about Jews: \\"What plague and syphilis are to humanity, are Jews to the white race.\\" However, Kube behaved towards German Jews in a relatively mild way during his charge in Minsk, by trying‚Äîunsuccessfully‚Äîto protect German Jews, whom he felt as culturally closer, from extermination.Gerald Fleming, Hitler and the Final Solution (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994), pp. 116‚Äì119. As for Minsk, he planned to level the city and replace it with a German settlement, called Asgard.Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and StalinBy Timothy Snyder page 251 Early life Kube was born in Glogau (today's G≈Çog√≥w), Prussian Silesia, and studied history, economics and theology. In 1911 he received a Moses Mendelssohn Scholarship from the University of BerlinUwe Puschner (Professor at the Free University of Berlin): Die v√∂lkische Bewegung im wilhelminischen Kaiserreich. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2001, , p. 11.. Kube was active in the V√∂lkisch movement as a student, and joined the Nazi Party in late 1927. From 1928 he was also leader of the tiny Nazi party faction (6 seats) in the Prussian Landtag (Prussian state legislature). Under his leadership it grew to be the largest party in the Landtag by 1932. On 1 February 1928, he was appointed Gauleiter of Ostmark with his seat at Frankfurt an der Oder. On 1 June 1933 this was merged with the neighboring Gau Brandenburg to form Gau Kurmark (later reorganized as the Gau March of Brandenburg) with its seat in Berlin. After the Nazis came to power, he was made Oberpr√§sident of the Prussian provinces of Brandenburg and Posen-West Prussia, thus uniting under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the provinces. He joined the SS on 29 September 1933 with the rank of Oberf√ºhrer and on 27 January 1934, he was promoted to SS- Gruppenf√ºhrer. In November 1933 he was elected as a Nazi deputy to the Reichstag.Michael D. Miller & Andreas Schulz: Gauleiter: The Regional Leaders of the Nazi Party and Their Deputies, 1925-1945, Volume II (Georg Joel - Dr. Bernhard Rust), R. James Bender Publishing, 2017, pp. 142-144 . Nazification of Christianity Kube remained an active Christian as well as a zealous Nazi, and in 1932 he organised the list of candidates of the Faith Movement of the German Christians for the ordinary election of presbyters and synodals within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union on 13 November that year. The German Christians then gained about a third of all seats in presbyteries and synods. Kube was elected as one of the presbyters of the congregation of Gethsemane Church in Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg. The presbyters elected him from their midst as synodal into the competent deanery synod (; Berlin then comprised 11 deaneries altogether), and these synodals again elected him a member of deanery synodal board (). When in 1933 the Nazis came to power he remained active in the German Christian movement which sought to \\"Nazify\\" the 28 Protestant church bodies in Germany.Biographical information from Ernst Klee, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich (Fischer Verlag 2005), 346 For 23 July 1933 Hitler ordered an unconstitutional, premature re-election of all presbyters and synodals, with the German Christians now gaining 70‚Äì80% of the seats, so Kube could then further advance as head of the Berlin synod of the old-Prussian Church. Following the German conquest of Poland in 1939 his Nazi party domain was extended to include Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Reichsgau Wartheland. Accusations and Removal from Office In late 1935 the High Party Court under Chairman Walter Buch, the father-in-law of Martin Bormann, began an investigation into Kube due to allegations of adultery and corruption in running his Gau, including nepotism, favoritism and a dictatorial management style. In December he was issued a letter of reprimand. Swearing revenge, Kube sent an anonymous letter claiming that Buch was married to a half-Jew. This, of course, would have far-reaching implications not only for Buch but for Bormann, whose wife consequently also was accused of not being a pure Aryan. Kube was leveling serious charges at two Party Reichsleiters. In the course of a Gestapo investigation, it came to light that the letter had been written by Kube. Buch and Bormann saw to it that Kube was removed from all his posts on 7 August 1936. Only on Hitler's orders was he allowed to retain the title of Gauleiter, albeit without a Gau. Furthermore, owing to a dispute with Reinhard Heydrich over a search conducted of Kube's mistress' apartment, Kube offered his resignation from the SS on 11 March 1936; he was officially discharged on 1 April. Reichskommissar of Weissruthenien On 17 July 1941, in the wake of the German occupation of the western parts of the Soviet Union, he was appointed Generalkommissar for Weissruthenien (now known as Belarus), with his headquarters in Minsk. In this role Kube oversaw the extermination of the large Jewish population of this area. He was nevertheless outraged by the Slutsk Affair in October 1941, when SS Einsatzgruppen (death squads) massacred Jews without the authority of the local Nazi civil administration and Security SS authorities. Local non-Jewish Belarusians were also killed, creating great resentment among the population. Kube wrote in protest to his supervisor and Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler: > The town was a picture of horror during the action. With indescribable > brutality on the part of both the German police officers and particularly > the Lithuanian partisans, the Jewish people, but also among them > Belarusians, were taken out of their dwellings and herded together. > Everywhere in the town shots were to be heard and in different streets the > corpses of shot Jews accumulated. The Belarusians were in greatest distress > to free themselves from the encirclement. The letter concluded: > I am submitting this report in duplicate so that one copy may be forwarded > to the Reich Minister. Peace and order cannot be maintained in Belarus with > methods of that sort. To bury seriously wounded people alive who worked > their way out of their graves again is such a base and filthy act that the > incidents as such should be reported to the F√ºhrer and Reichsmarschall.Nazi > Conspiracy and Aggression: Volume III (Office of United States Chief of > Counsel for Prosecution of Axis Criminality OCCPAC). Washington, D.C.: > USGPO. 1946. pp.783‚Äì789 accessed January 2008. Despite these misgivings, Kube participated in an atrocity on 2 March 1942 in the Minsk ghetto. During a search by German and Belarusian police, a group of children were seized and thrown into pits of deep sand to die. > At that moment, several SS officers, among them Wilhelm Kube, arrived, > whereupon Kube, immaculate in his uniform, threw handfuls of sweets to the > shrieking children. All the children perished in the sand.Gilbert, M: \\"The > Holocaust\\", page 297. Fontana/Collins, 1987. Kube's contradictory attitude towards Jews is shown in his behaviour towards German Jews deported to Minsk. He was particularly incensed by the presence among the deportees of men decorated during World War I. These Jews who he regarded as belonging \\"to our cultural milieu\\" prompted Kube to file a complaint with Reinhard Heydrich, in which he stated that \\"during the evacuation of Jews from the Reich, the guidelines on who was to be evacuated had not been properly observed\\" and he attached a list of names. During the 2 March 1942 massacre, Generalkommissar Kube withheld German Jews from a mass shooting which was conducted in Minsk under the supervision of Sturmbannf√ºhrer Eduard Strauch, at which 3,412 Jews were killed, an unprecedented act that provoked a formal complaint from the SS according to which \\"Generalkommissar Kube appears to have promised to the German Jews, who before my time were delivered to the ghetto five thousand strong, that life and health would remain theirs\\". Heydrich flew to Minsk to deliver Kube a reprimand, after which he felt compelled to comply with extermination actions. On 31 July he wrote to his friend, the Reichskommissar for the Ostland, Hinrich Lohse, in Riga: > Following lengthy talks with the SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Zenner and the > extraordinarily diligent head of the SD, SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Strauch, in > the last two weeks in White Russia we have liquidated roughly 55,000 > Jews....In the city of Minsk about 10,000 Jews were liquidated on 28 and 29 > July. Of these, 6,500 were Russian Jews, predominantly women, children, and > the aged; the rest were Jews unfit for labor, mainly from Vienna, Br√ºnn, > Bremen, and Berlin. The latter had been sent to Minsk last year in > accordance with the F√ºhrer's orders....In Minsk proper there are 2,600 Jews > from Germany left. Quoted from Gerald Fleming, Hitler and the Final Solution > (Berkeley: University of California Press 1987), 116 ‚Äì 119. Assassination At 1:20 am on 22 September 1943, Kube was assassinated in his Minsk apartment by a time device hidden in his mattress in Operation Blow- Up. According to one version of the plot, the bomb was allegedly placed by Soviet partisan Yelena Mazanik (1914‚Äì1996), a Belarusian woman who was hired in Kube's household as a maid and was convinced to assassinate him later. Alternatively, the explosives were set up by Lev Liberman from the Minsk ghetto, who was also employed in the household. In total 12 groups received an order from Moscow to assassinate Kube. The bomb went off forty minutes early, purportedly due to higher air temperature than that during bomb testing. In retaliation, the SS killed more than 1,000 men who were citizens of Minsk. Owing to Kube's antagonistic attitude to some SS anti-Jewish actions, Himmler felt that the dead man had been well on the way to booking himself a place in a concentration camp anyway,Hilberg, Raul (2003). The Destruction of the European Jews (3rd ed.). New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. p. 400\\\\. and reportedly described the assassination as a \\"blessing\\".Reidlinger 1960 p.157 as quoted in Turonek 1989 p.118. Mazanik escaped the reprisals and continued to fight with the partisans. She was later awarded the title Heroine of the Soviet Union. After the war she went on to become deputy director of the Fundamental Library of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences.

She moved to the United States in 1946, married, had two sons and worked as an insurance agent. In 1994, she published From Ashes to Life: My Memories of the Holocaust. She frequently lectured on the Holocaust at libraries, schools and universities in the U.S. and Germany. She took part in a documentary from the University of Giessen on life in the Ghetto, for which she was awarded an honorary doctorate. Life Born Cecilie Landau in Hamburg, Germany, on February 1, 1925, she was the older of two daughters of the Polish-born wine merchant Benjamin Landau and his wife Sala (Sara), n√©e Baumwollspinner. She described her childhood as \\"very nice, very comfortable\\" before Hitler came to power in 1933. After that, the Jews became exposed to growing repressive measures by the Nazis as well as insults and assaults by the local population. After returning to Hamburg in the spring of 1939, Benjamin Landau was arrested by the Gestapo on September 1 of that year during the attack on Poland, as a \\"foreign enemy\\". He was first brought to a police jail in Fuhlsb√ºttel, then to Oranienburg concentration camp, and finally to Dachau concentration camp, where he was murdered on December 31, 1940. The family learned of his death only in February 1941, when the Gestapo brought his ashes, \\"in a cigar box with a rubber band\\", to their apartment, as Eichengreen recalls: =Deportation= On October 25, 1941, she was deported, at age 16, to the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (Litzmannstadt) Ghetto with her mother and her younger sister Karin. In the ghetto, her mother starved to death, dying on July 13, 1942. Lucille found work and survived, living under inhumane conditions. Karin, whom she took care of, was separated from her at age eleven in September 1942, deported to Che≈Çmno extermination camp and murdered.Martin Doerry: \\"Lucille Eichengreen on Surviving the Holocaust\\" Der Spiegel International, 2006, retrieved December 10, 2011 Lucille worked as a secretary for the journalist and writer Oskar Singer.Andrea L√∂w: \\"Reportagen aus dem Ghetto Lodz\\" Arbeitsstelle Holocaust Literatur at University of Giessen, 2010, retrieved December 10, 2011 In 1943, she was hit on the left ear during an interrogation by the Nazi police after a denunciation, resulting in permanent deafness in that ear. In August 1943, she was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp, where she was deemed fit to work during the selection process. A few weeks later, when she went through another selection process, concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele sent her to the satellite camp Dessauer Ufer of KZ Neuengamme, where she was forced to perform heavy labour, working in construction and removing detritus from bomb damage. Later, she was assigned to office work, although she was still exposed to mistreatment from supervisors. In March 1945, she was deported to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. =After liberation of the concentration camps= Commemorative plaque with an image of Lucille Eichengreen Landau was the only member of her immediate family to survive the Holocaust, although it was not until 1947 that she was certain that her sister had died. After the liberation of the Bergen- Belsen camp by the British army, she spent a few months in the camp for displaced persons in Bergen-Belsen, working as a translator for the British. In cooperation with the British forces, she identified 40 members of the SS as having worked in the Neuengamme concentration camp, leading to their arrest and trial before a court. After receiving death threats, she moved to the United States, where she married another Jewish emigrant from Hamburg, Dan Eichengreen. According to her own account, she struggled to overcome the effects of the traumatic events of her youth and suffered from recurring nightmares. In 1995, she returned to Poland and Germany for the first time since 1945, including a visit to Hamburg after accepting an invitation by the Hamburg senate. She also returned to Auschwitz and the former ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ghetto. Eichengreen last lived in Oakland, California. One of her two sons is the American economist Barry Eichengreen.

His highest rank was sekiwake. In 1991 he won a top division y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship from the maegashira ranks. Career Kotofuji made his professional debut in March 1980. He had a long apprenticeship in the junior ranks, not breaking through to the j≈´ry≈ç division until November 1986. He had an awkward build for sumo, as his long legs meant his hips were high and therefore his centre of gravity was much higher than the ideal. During the short stay of Canadian wrestler Kototenzan at Sadogatake stable, Kotofuji was one of the few wrestlers who attempted to communicate with him in English. He reached the top makuuchi division in September 1988, scoring 11 wins in his top division debut and receiving a share of the Fighting Spirit prize. He made his san'yaku debut at sekiwake in July 1990 but held the rank for only one tournament. He earned his first gold star in January 1991 with a win over ≈ånokuni. Kotofuji is best remembered for his extraordinary performance in the Nagoya tournament of July 1991, where he became the first maegashira to win the tournament championship in nearly six years. After a poor 5-10 record at maegashira 7 the previous tournament he was ranked at maegashira 13, and fought only his fellow maegashira for the first nine days. Winning all those bouts, he was paired against ≈çzeki Kirishima, yokozuna Asahifuji and ≈çzeki Konishiki on days 10 to 12 - and won all of those matches too. It was the first time he had defeated either Asahifuji or Konishiki. His y≈´sh≈ç was confirmed the following day when he defeated sekiwake Takat≈çriki to go to 13‚Äì0, with no else scoring better than ten. He became the first wrestler ranked below ≈çzeki to win the championship by Day 13 since the introduction of 15-day tournaments. Although he was beaten by Takahanada on Day 14, he defeated Akebono on the final day to finish with an outstanding 14‚Äì1 record, two wins clear of runner-up Konishiki on 12‚Äì3. Both yokozuna, Asahifuji and Hokutoumi had poor tournaments, turning in scores of 8-7 and 9‚Äì6, the worst ever for a tournament with two yokozuna. Kotofuji received his second Fighting Spirit prize as well as the Emperor's Cup. He was as surprised as anyone else at his win, telling an interviewer for Channel 4 that he had just wanted the tournament to be over as soon as possible as he felt sure he wouldn't make it. Kotofuji never approached anything like those heights again. He scored only 4-11 at komusubi in the following tournament and never made san'yaku again. After a series of poor results he was demoted to the second j≈´ry≈ç division in 1994 and announced his retirement from sumo in September 1995. Retirement from sumo He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, under the name of Kumegawa Oyakata, but he had to leave the sumo world in July 1999 when his toshiyori name was needed by his retiring former stablemate Kotoinazuma. Because his career as an oyakata had lasted less than four years, he was not entitled to any retirement money. Kotofuji then launched a new career as a television personality, doing reporting and sportscasting. He was a member of Konishiki's talent agency. He also worked as a manager of one of ex-sekiwake Takatoriki's yakiniku restaurants. In February 2014 he was arrested for engaging in a fake marriage to a Korean national so she could receive permanent resident status. Fighting style Kotofuji was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring a hidari- yotsu, (right hand outside, left hand inside) grip on his opponent's mawashi. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri, a straightforward force out, which accounted for half his victories at sekitori level, but he was also fond of using his right hand grip to win by uwatenage, or overarm throw. His height of 192 cm made him amongst the tallest wrestlers but his weight of 145 kg was not much more than most of his competitors.

History Lorenzo was the son of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici and Piccarda Bueri. He was educated by Carlo Marsuppini.Benedetto Accolti and the Florentine Renaissance; by Robert Black; Cambridge University Press (1985); page 72. In 1416, he married Ginevra Cavalcanti. To celebrate their marriage, the Venetian humanist Francesco Barbaro wrote his treatise De Re Uxoria, an analysis of marriage that continued to be published for centuries. Lorenzo and Ginevra had two sons: Francesco, who was childless, and Pierfrancesco, who originated the Popolani line. Ginevra Cavalcanti was an aunt of the wife of the famous Italian merchant Giovanni Arnolfini. Lorenzo followed his brother Cosimo in his military maneuvers at Ferrara, Verona and Vicenza. In 1433 he tried to muster an army to free Cosimo from imprisonment when the latter was arrested under the charge of tyranny. Later, he joined him at Venice and returned with him in Florence triumphantly after Cosimo's rehabilitation. Though dedicating himself much to banking activity, Lorenzo held several positions in the Florentine Republic and was ambassador to Pope Eugene IV and the Republic of Venice. In 1435, he moved to Rome to oversee the affairs of the Medici Bank at the papal court. Lorenzo the Elder was ancestor to all the Grand Dukes of Tuscany through his direct descendant Cosimo I de' Medici. He is also the ancestor to seven kings of France beginning with Louis XIII as a result of the marriage of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV of France. He died in the Medici Villa of Careggi in 1440 and was buried in the Basilica of San Lorenzo. Fictional Depictions A young Lorenzo is portrayed by Stuart Martin in the 2016 television series Medici: Masters of Florence. Although the television production has him assassinated, these events did not take place in real life. The show appears to be using elements from a later attack on his great nephew, Giuliano de' Medici, for dramatic effect.

The square- shaped tank dates from the 17th century, and was built on the eastern side of the then city limits. It lies just outside a former city gate. The pond is one of Kathmandu's most famous landmarks and is known for its religious and aesthetic significance. Its dimensions are 180m by 140m. Construction Rani Pokhari, Kathmandu, Nepal Rani Pokhari was built in 1670 AD by King Pratap Malla, one of the most illustrious monarchs of the Malla dynasty that ruled Nepal for more than 600 years. Pratap Malla had the tank constructed to console his queen who was distraught with grief after their son was trampled to death by an elephant. He had water collected from various holy places and river confluences in Nepal and India like Gosaikunda, Muktinath, Badrinath, Kedarnath and poured into the pond to sanctify it. A temple dedicated to Matrikeshwor Mahadev, a form of the Hindu deity Shiva, stands at the center of the pond. There is an idol of Harishankari, which is said to be the only one idol of both Saraswoti and Laxmi. It is reached from the street by a causeway. A large stone statue of an elephant bearing the images of Pratap Malla and his two sons Chakravartendra Malla and Mahipatendra Malla is situated on the tank's southern embankment. The pond is recharged by water flowing in through an underground channel. There are four smaller temples situated at the four corners of the pond: Bhairava temples in the northwest and northeast, Mahalaxmi Temple in the southeast and Ganesh Temple in the southwest. The temples on the eastern side now lie within the compounds of Tri Chandra College and a police station which has undermined their cultural importance. thumb Rani Pokhari is fenced with iron bars and opened once a year during Bhai Tika, the fifth and final day of the Tihar, and Chhath festival. The world's largest Chhath festival takes place every year in RaniPokhari. Rani is also dedicated to (Nepalese Maithil) Women who go into the cold water and pray to the Sun God. Rani Pokhari inscription King Pratap Malla installed a stone slab at Rani Pokhari with writings in three languages: Sanskrit, Nepali and Nepal Bhasa. It is dated Nepal Sambat 790 (1670 AD) and describes the construction of Rani Pokhari and its religious significance. It also mentions five Brahmins, five Pradhans (Chief-ministers) and five Khas Magars as being witnesses. Western references Among the earliest references to Rani Pokhari is an account by Italian Jesuit Ippolito Desideri who visited Kathmandu in 1721 when Nepal was ruled by the Malla kings. He was travelling from Tibet to India, and has mentioned in his travelogue seeing a large pond outside the main city gate with flights of steps and banks sloping down to the water. The father has also written that there was a tall column at the center resting on a magnificent pedestal. The British Indian Army officer William Kirkpatrick, who visited Kathmandu in 1793, wrote about a quadrangular reservoir of water situated near the northeastern part of the city. He also noted the existence of many temples on the sides of Rani Pokhari, some of which were of considerable height and size. Controversial upgrade Ranipokhari being restored with bricks in stead of concrete The restoration work on Ranipokhari after the 2015 earthquake began in January 2016 and has been fraught with controversy. The original plans used concrete for the restoration, instead of the traditional brick and clay, and included fountains and a new lakeside caf√©. After a series of local protests it was decided to restore the pond to the way it was in 1670.Rani Pokhari blunder, The Kathmandu Post, September 28, 2018, retrieved 14 September 2019Reconstruction work of Rani Pokhari resumes by Anup Ojha, The Kathmandu Post, March 6, 2019, retrieved 14 September 2019Bhaktapur sets an example for local-led heritage reconstruction, while Kathmandu and Patan fall short by Timothy Aryal, The Kathmandu Post, April 25, 2019, retrieved 14 September 2019 Famous structures Rani Pokhari is surrounded by historical buildings and famous structures. The clock tower Ghanta Ghar is situated across the road on the eastern side of the pond. The original clock tower, which had a more elaborate architecture, was destroyed during the Great earthquake of 1934. The present clock tower was built after the earthquake. It stands on the premises of Tri Chandra College, the first college in the country which was established in 1918 AD. On the western side of Rani Pokhari stands another historical building, Durbar High School, built in 1854 AD. It is the first school in Nepal providing education along with modern lines. In the beginning, Durbar High School only admitted the children of the ruling classes. It was opened to the general public in 1902 AD. Tundikhel, a parade ground and ceremonial grass field and a Kathmandu landmark, formerly extended from the southern side of Rani Pokhari. A section next to the pond was fenced off and converted into a public park and flower garden in the mid-1960s.

The tallest peak, Qingshui Mountain, rises 2408 meters directly from the Pacific Ocean. The cliff is located at the southern part of the Suhua Highway that connects the counties of Yilan and Hualien in eastern Taiwan. It is considered to be a very scenic area and is the highest coastal cliff in Taiwan. It is located within Taroko National Park. Geology The formation of the Qingshui Cliff was caused by the orogenic movement, with the Philippine Plate and the Eurasian Plate forming a fault line. The outcropping above sea level is composed of metamorphosed limestone marble, gneiss, and green schist, and is classified as a metamorphic complex area of Dananao on the geological map. Because there are very few coastal cliffs in the world that exhibit such a great elevation drop, the natural landscape of \\"high cliff valley\\" makes Qingshui cliff a rare coastal cliff. The coast of the Qingshui Cliff is continually beaten and eroded by the sea water of the Pacific Ocean, and the rock walls on it are subject to natural forces such as earthquakes and typhoons. The beaches below are full of different sizes of marble stones, from giant boulders to grains of sand. Political disputes The depiction of Qingshui Cliff is featured in the newly issued passport of the People's Republic of China in 2012, a move that triggered protest from Taipei to Beijing. Biogeographic significance Qingshui Cliff can act as a dispersal barrier. It separates the eastern and western clades of brown tree frog (Buergeria robusta) as well as two sibling species of Takydromus lizards, T. viridipunctatus and T. luyeanus. In the latter case, the separation occurs over a single river, the Liwu River. Transportation Qingshui Cliff is accessible southwest from Heren Station of the Taiwan Railways.

North Korea jams South Korean state broadcasts and foreign shortwave broadcast services which it believes to be against the North Korean regime. These include the Korean language service of the Voice of America, Free North Korea Radio (which originates from US transmitters in Guam), Radio Free Asia, and several other services and broadcasts. Radio jamming in South Korea The South Korean government constantly jams most radio broadcasts from North Korea on medium-wave. According to the National Security Act in South Korea, it is illegal to tune into or publish frequencies of North Korean broadcasts. Yet an ordinary South Korean citizen cannot be easily punished for merely listening to those broadcasts in private. However, public listening and distribution of recordings of an anti-government organisation, namely North Korea, are criminal offences. A listener in the Seoul Metropolitan area (Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province) or near the DMZ who tunes across the MW band may hear strange signals on several MW frequencies, mixing with North Korean radio broadcasts. These include 657 kHz (PBS Pyongyang), 720 kHz (KCBS Wiwon), 819 kHz (KCBS Pyongyang), 882 kHz and 1080 kHz (KCBS Haeju). The South Korean government broadcasts several bizarre-sounding jamming sounds (usually warbling or chugging) in an attempt to prevent their citizens from hearing radio broadcasts from the North. The medium-wave jamming by the South is sometimes too weak to completely block the North Korean broadcasts (the jamming transmission power seems to be between 20 and 50 kilowatts, while the targeted North Korean transmissions are of much higher transmission power‚Äîtypically over 500 kilowatts). Using a decent quality radio, a listener can sometimes nullify the South Korean jammer by re-orienting the set so its ferrite antenna points in a different direction. On shortwave, jamming is not as severe; only a very few North Korean frequencies are slightly jammed. FM jamming is also carried out and it is highly effective in Seoul. Television jamming in South Korea was widespread before the introduction of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) in South Korea. In Seoul, one could see color bars on particular channels of the VHF band used by (North) Korean Central Television. Now jamming with random signals on those channels is not done, but the channels are used for DMB broadcasting. The digital broadcasts provide reliable portable digital television multimedia broadcasts, but cause severe interference with the North Korean analogue signals. Radio jamming in North Korea It is illegal for North Koreans to listen to anything other than state-run radio and all radios sold by state shops in North Korea are fix- tuned to government frequencies, though radios capable of receiving foreign broadcasts can be bought on the black market. North Korea does not jam any commercial South Korean television or radio broadcasts, However, North Korea jam some of South Korea's state-owned radio and television broadcasts (namely KBS1 Ch. 9 KBS2 Ch.7 KBS Radio 1 711 kHz and 97.3 MHz, KBS 1FM 93.1 MHz, KBS Radio 2 603 kHz/106.1 MHz, KBS 2FM 89.1 MHz KBS Radio 3 1134 kHz/104.9 MHz, KBS Radio Social Education 6,015 kHz and Korean Forces Network 96.7 MHz). Before the (early 2007) closure of South Korean shortwave domestic radio broadcasts (which were often targeted at the North) 3930 kHz KBS Radio 1 and 6015 and 6135 kHz KBS Radio Korean Ethnicity (formerly KBS Radio Social Education) had been severely jammed by the North. The type of the jamming on shortwave is \\"Jet Plane Noise\\", which makes it very hard to hear the radio broadcasts. Since that type has a wide bandwidth than general broadcasts on shortwave, others near the broadcast aimed by that jamming are also hard to assure the clear transmission. North Korea jams South Korea's clandestine shortwave broadcast, Echo of Hope, and the South Korean international shortwave broadcasts of KBS World Radio on 5975 kHz (discontinued as of early 2007) and 7275 kHz. The South Korean national radio channel, KBS Radio 1 on 711 kHz medium-wave is also jammed by the North. Before the bilateral declaration in 2000, KBS Radio 1 used to deliver certain programmes (merged with then KBS Radio Social Education) which condemned the North Korean regime at midnight. A visitor to coastal areas of the Yellow Sea (covering coastal parts of Gyeonggi Province, Incheon, Chungcheong, and sometimes Jeolla regions) who tunes into 711 kHz (KBS Radio 1 Seoul) may hear strange beeping sounds, which seem to be jamming signals from the North. KBS Radio Korean Ethnicity no longer targets North Koreans since the North-South Korea Joint Declaration on 15 June 2000. As of 15 August 2007, the radio channel has changed to a special radio broadcast for the Russian Far East and Northeast China, where nearly three million Koreans in China and several hundred thousand Koryo-saram (ethnic Koreans in Central Asia) live. North Korean jamming of television is relatively unusual, although the North Korean regime once severely jammed a South Korean state-owned television broadcast (KBS 1TV on VHF ch. 9 in Seoul) in the 1970s. Currently there used to be some strange signals on VHF ch. 9 (KBS1) as well as VHF ch. 7 (KBS2) in Seoul which may be North Korean jamming; the two analogue TV channels were discontinued as of 31 December 2012. This jamming is not very effective. Due to electricity shortages in North Korea, radio jamming activities are not consistent and are sometimes interrupted by power failures. A group by the name of Free North Korea Radio conducts numerous activities that focus on providing radio broadcasts to North Koreans. The broadcasts often include instructions on methods to leave the country and the group has contact with underground reporters within North Korea. The group primarily consists of numerous North Korean refugees and defectors. In late September 2017, the BBC World Service launched shortwave broadcasts in Korean aimed at the Korean Peninsula from its transmitters in Taiwan and Tashkent, which North Korea quickly began jamming.

It is a broad spectrum systemic fungicide widely used in agriculture to protect crops from fungal diseases. It was first marketed in 1996 using the brand name Amistar and by 1999 it had been registered in 48 countries on more than 50 crops. In the year 2000 it was announced that it had been granted UK Millennium product status.  History  EEE (incorrect first published structure) and EZE strobilurin A with the related natural product fungicide oudemansin A Strobilurus tenacellus In 1977, academic research groups in Germany published details of two new antifungal antibiotics they had isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Strobilurus tenacellus. They named these strobilurin A and B but did not provide detailed structures, only data based on their high-resolution mass spectra, which showed that the simpler of the two had molecular formula C16H18O3. In the following year, further details including structures were published and a related fungicide, oudemansin A from the fungus Oudemansiella mucida, whose identity had been determined by X-ray crystallography, was disclosed. When the fungicidal effects were shown to stem from what was then a novel mode of action, chemists at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) research site at Jealott's Hill became interested to use them as leads to develop new fungicides suitable for use in agriculture. The first task was to synthesize a sample of strobilurin A for testing. In doing so, it was discovered that the structure that had been published was incorrect in the stereochemistry of one of the double bonds: the strobilurins, in fact, have the E,Z,E not E,E,E configuration. Once this was realised and the correct material was made and tested it was shown, as expected, to be active in vitro but insufficiently stable to light to be active in the glasshouse. A large programme of chemistry to make analogues was begun when it was discovered that a new stilbene structure containing the Œ≤-methoxyacrylate portion (shown in blue and believed to be the toxophore) had good activity in glasshouse tests but still lacked sufficient photostability. After more than 1400 analogues had been made and tested the team chose azoxystrobin for commercialisation and it was developed under the code number ICIA5504. The stilbene was the first synthetic analogue to show activity and led to azoxystrobin First sales were in 1996 using the brand name Amistar: it then gained fast-track registration in the United States, where it was marketed in 1997 as Heritage. By 1999 it had been registered in 48 countries on more than 50 crops. In the year 2000 it was announced that it had been granted Millennium product status by the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, as it had become in three years the world‚Äôs best- selling fungicide. Meanwhile, BASF scientists who were collaborating with the German academic groups that had discovered strobilurin A had independently invented kresoxim-methyl, which was also launched in 1996.  Synthesis  The first synthesis of azoxystrobin was disclosed in patents filed by the ICI group. The sequence of the two substitution reactions allows for the synthesis of a diverse range of structural analogs via an Ullmann-type etherification between the aryl chloride of the first intermediate and a substituted phenol, thus introducing a range of structural diversity while maintaining the central strobin toxophore. The final choice of 2-cyano phenol in the second step of the synthesis was made after many other alternatives had been tested for their fungicidal properties. Azoxystrobin is made by sequential substitution reactions of two phenols with the reactive dichloropyrimidine The crystal structure was published in 2008.  Mechanism of action  Cytochrome bc1 with bound ubiquinone Azoxystrobin and other strobilurins inhibit mitochondrial respiration by blocking electron transport. They bind at the quinol outer binding site of the cytochrome b-c1 complex, where ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) would normally bind when carrying electrons to that protein. Thus production of ATP is prevented. The generic name for this mode of action is \\"Quinone Outside Inhibitors\\" QoI.  Formulations  Azoxystrobin is made available to end-users only in formulated products. Since the active ingredient has moderate solubility in water, formulations aid its use in water-based sprays by creating an emulsion when diluted. Modern products use non-powdery formulations with reduced or no use of hazardous solvents, for example suspension concentrates. The fungicide is compatible with many other pesticides and adjuvants when mixed by the farmer for spraying.  Usage  Azoxystrobin is a xylem-mobile systemic fungicide with translaminar, protectant and curative properties. In cereal crops, its main outlet, the length of disease control is generally about four to six weeks during the period of active stem elongation. All pesticides are required to seek registration from appropriate authorities in the country in which they will be used. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). A pesticide can only be used legally according to the directions on the label that is included at the time of the sale of the pesticide. The purpose of the label is \\"to provide clear directions for effective product performance while minimizing risks to human health and the environment\\". A label is a legally binding document that mandates how the pesticide can and must be used and failure to follow the label as written when using the pesticide is a federal offence. Within the European Union, a 2-tiered approach is used for the approval and authorisation of pesticides. Firstly, before a formulated product can be developed for market, the active substance must be approved for the European Union. After this has been achieved, authorisation for the specific product must be sought from every Member State that the applicant wants to sell it to. Afterwards, there is a monitoring programme to make sure the pesticide residues in food are below the limits set by the European Food Safety Authority. Azoxystrobin usage in the USA to 2017 (estimated) =Agriculture and Horticulture= Azoxystrobin possesses a broad spectrum of activity, in common with other QoI inhibitors. Examples of the fungal groups on which it is effective are Ascomycota, Deuteromycota, and Basidiomycota, as well as the oomycetes. In addition, its properties mean that it can move systemically through plant tissue to protect parts of the crop that were not in contact with the spray. This combination of properties has meant that it achieved widespread use very quickly and has reached annual sales of more than $500 million. Important diseases which it controls include leaf spot, rusts, powdery mildew, downy mildew, net blotch and blight. Worldwide, azoxystrobin is registered for use on all important crops. For example, in the European Union and United states, it is registered for use in wheat, barley, oats, rye, soya, cotton, rice, strawberry, peas, beans, onions and many other vegetables. The advantage to the farmer comes in the form of improved yield at harvest. Farmers can act in their best economic interest: the value of the additional yield can be estimated and the total cost of using the fungicide informs the decision to purchase. This cost-benefit analysis by the end user sets a maximum price which the supplier can demand and in practice pesticide prices fluctuate according to the current market value of the crops in which they are used. The estimated annual use of azoxystrobin in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Survey and shows an increasing trend from its introduction in 1997 to 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, and now reaching . =Home and garden= One of the earliest uses of azoxystrobin was to control fungal diseases of turf and it has been used on golf courses and lawns. It is now available for domestic markets under brand names such as Heritage and Azoxy 2SC. Azoxystrobin is added to mold- resistant Purple wallboards (optiSHIELD AT, mixture of azoxystrobin and thiabendazole) and can leach into house dust, potentially providing a source of life-long exposure to children and adults.  Human safety  Azoxystrobin has little toxicity to mammals with an LD50 of over 5000 mg/kg (rats, oral). However, it can cause skin and eye irritation. First aid information is included with the label. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) joint meeting on pesticide residues has determined that the acceptable daily intake for azoxystrobin is 0-0.2 mg/kg bodyweight per day. The Codex Alimentarius database maintained by the FAO lists the maximum residue limits for azoxystrobin in various food products.  Effects on the environment  Azoxystrobin is categorized as having a low potential for bioconcentration and of moderate risk to fish, earthworms and bees but of high risk to aquatic crustaceans, so care must be taken to avoid runoff into water bodies. Its main degradation product, the carboxylic acid resulting from hydrolysis of its methyl ester, is also potentially harmful to aquatic environments. The benefits and risks of use of QoI fungicides have been reviewed and there is extensive literature on azoxystrobin's environmental profile. Ultimately it is the regulatory authorities in each country who must weigh up the benefits to end users and balance these against the compound's inherent hazards and consequent risks to consumers and the wider environment. Resistance Management Fungal populations have the ability to develop resistance to QoI inhibitors. This potential can be mitigated by careful management. Reports of individual pest species becoming resistant to azoxystrobin are monitored by manufacturers, regulatory bodies such as the EPA and the Fungicides Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), who assign fungicides into classes by mode of action. In some cases, the risks of resistance developing can be reduced by using a mixture of two or more fungicides which each have activity on relevant pests but with unrelated mechanisms of action. FRAC assigns fungicides into classes so as to facilitate this. On cereal crops in the USA, for example, azoxystrobin may only be used in mixture, usually with an azole fungicide such as difenoconazole. Brands By international convention and in many countries the law, pesticide labels are required to include the common name of the active ingredients. These names are not the exclusive property of the holder of any patent or trademark and as such they are the easiest way for non-experts to refer to individual chemicals. Companies selling pesticides normally do so using a brand name or wordmark which allows them to distinguish their product from competitor products having the same active ingredient. In many cases, this branding is country and formulation-specific so after several years of sales there can be multiple brand names for a given active ingredient. The situation is made even more complicated when companies license their ingredients to others, as is often done. In addition, the product may be pre-mixed with other pesticides under a new brand name. It is therefore difficult to provide a comprehensive list of brand names for products containing azoxystrobin. They include Amistar, Abound, Heritage, Olympus, Ortiva, Priori Xtra and Quadris. Suppliers and brand names in the United States are listed in the National Pesticide Information Retrieval System.

He was born at Montherm√©, the Ardennes, France, of an old aristocratic family, After the Franco-Prussian war (1870‚Äì71), his parents settled in Belgium, and he taught himself to paint. In 1894 he married fellow artist Juliette Massin, who introduced him to the circle of Symbolist poets, who had a considerable influence on his style. He belonged to the avant-garde group Les XX and later exhibited at La Libre Esth√©tique. He travelled widely and painted views of Italy, Austria and France, often of parks at night. His best-known pictures, Pink House (1892), The Angels (1894), and Peacocks (1896), demonstrate the magical quality of his work. Pink House is thought to have been a major influence on Surrealism, especially the paintings of Ren√© Magritte. He is supposed to have said \\"To make a painting, all you need to do is to take some paints, draw some lines, and fill the rest up with feelings.\\" A regular exhibitor in Paris, he was championed by Puvis de Chavannes and Maurice Denis. From 1900 to 1902 he and his wife lived in the Balearic Islands, where he painted the rugged coastline and the orange groves. After suffering a religious crisis around 1910, he painted pictures that revealed his tormented state of mind, and during World War I, while a refugee in the Netherlands, he produced only minor works. In 1919 he was overwhelmed by the death of his wife and lost the use of one hand. In 1930 he married the woman who had helped him through the crisis. They settled in Stavelot, where he spent his last few years painting snow-covered landscapes. The best collection of his paintings is in the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, Otterlo.

It is managed under a Deed of Grant in Trust under the Local Government (Community Government Areas) Act 2004.  Geography  The shire is located within the Gulf Country to the south of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It consists of two disconnected areas of land: the locality of Doomadgee which is inland and the locality of Gangalidda on the coast of the gulf. The shire was excised from the Shire of Burke and is surrounded by the Shire of Burke. History The name Doomadgee derives from Dumaji, a coastal sand dune in the traditional land of the Gangalidda people. Waanyi (also known as Wanyi, Wanyee, Wanee, Waangyee, Wonyee, Garawa, and Wanji) is an Australian Aboriginal language of the Gulf Country. The language region includes the western parts of Lawn Hill Creek and Nicholson River, from about the boundary between the Northern Territory and Queensland, westwards towards Alexandria station, Doomadgee, and Nicholson River. It includes the local government area of the Aboriginal Shire of Doomadgee. The Yukulta (also known as Ganggalida) language region is also of the Gulf Country, including the local government areas of the Aboriginal Shire of Doomadgee and Shire of Mornington. \\"Old Doomadgee Mission\\" was established in 1933 by the Akehursts, a Christian Brethren family, supported by the church and Queensland's Chief Protector of Aboriginals, to house primarily Gangalidda people who had ended up living on the fringes of the Burketown township. It was located at Dumaji at Bayley Point Aboriginal reserve, on Gangalidda land. After a cyclone in 1936 destroyed the settlement, and the decision was made to move the settlement to Nicholson River, where the later Doomadgee Mission was established at \\"new Doomadgee\\". Doomadgee's population increased greatly during the 1950s-1960s, and facilities including a store, bank, post office, rodeo ground and a bakery were established. From a population of 138 in 1938, it had grown to 1257 by 2011. On 30 March 1985, the Doomadgee community elected five councillors to constitute an autonomous Doomadgee Aboriginal Council, and on 21 May 1987, under the Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984 the Aboriginal reserve was transferred from the Queensland Government to the trusteeship of the Doomadgee Aboriginal Council, under a Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT). The area included the sites of both the former and current mission. On 1 January 2005, the Doomadgee Aboriginal Council became the Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council. In 2010 the Doomadgee Aboriginal Shire Council was established under the Local Government Act 2009. People The majority of residents are Gangalidda or Waanyi people, but smaller populations of Gadawa, Lardil, Mingginda and Garawa are also resident within Doomadgee.

It originally weighed 2.18 grams, was composed of 98.5% pure silver, and was valued at 26 dinarii. Its name is from the same root as groschen and the English groat, all deriving ultimately from the denaro grosso (\\"large penny\\"). Its value was allowed to float relative to other Venetian coins until it was pegged to 4 soldini in 1332, incidentally the year the soldino was introduced. In 1332, 1 grosso was the equivalent of 4 soldini, or 48 dinarii. Economic background The Renaissance of the 12th century brought wealth and economic sophistication, but Venetians continued to use the badly debased remnants of the coinage system introduced by Charlemagne.John Porteous, Coins in History, page 83. Venice struck silver pennies (called denari in Italian) based on the coinage of Verona, which contained less than half a gram of 25% fine silver. Domestic transactions predominantly used these coins or their Veronese counterparts. About 1180, however, Verona modified its coinage, upsetting this practice. For foreign trade, Venetian merchants favored Byzantine coinage or coins of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin‚Äôs conquest of Jerusalem in 1187 and the progressing debasement of the Byzantine aspron trachy, however, made this less viable.Thomas F. Madden, Enrico Dandolo and The Rise of Venice, page 109 Elsewhere in Western Europe the situation was similar. A few efforts were made to reverse the decline of the Carolingian penny which had been their currency for four hundred years. In Lombardy, Frederick Barbarossa struck denari imperiali at double the weight of the pennies of Milan. The consistent fineness of the English sterling, or short cross penny, which Henry II introduced in 1180 made it a popular trading currency in Northern Europe.John Porteous, Coins in History, page 71. But it remained for Doge Enrico Dandolo of Venice to make the decisive breakthrough with a higher denomination coin of fine silver called a grosso. These coins had two advantages over the old pennies. First, minting and handling costs were reduced by substituting one large coin for tens of smaller ones. Second, the purity of their silver made them acceptable outside of Venice.Philip Grierson, The Coins of Medieval Europe, page 106. In Venice The earliest surviving account of Enrico Dandolo‚Äôs introduction of the Venetian grosso associates it with the outfitting of the Fourth Crusade in 1202Alan M. Stahl, Zecca the mint of Venice in the Middle Ages, page 17 and tradition makes the need to pay for the ships which transported the crusaders the cause of the grosso‚Äôs introduction. Even though coinage of the grosso might have begun a few years earlier, the influx of silver used to pay for the crusaders‚Äô ships led to its first large scale mintage. The coin had 2.2 grams of 98.5% fine silver, the purest medieval metallurgy could make.Thomas F. Madden, Enrico Dandolo and The Rise of Venice, page 110 It was initially called a ducatus argenti since Venice was a duchy, but is more widely known as a grosso or matapano, a Muslim term referring to the seated figure on its reverse.Philip Grierson, The Coins of Medieval Europe, page 107. Grosso of Francesco Dandolo, 1328-1339 The designs for the grosso came from the doge‚Äôs seal and the Byzantine aspron trachy. The obverse shows the standing figures of the doge and Saint Mark the Evangelist, the patron of Venice. On the right, Saint Mark holds the gospel, which is his usual attribute, and presents a Gonfalone to the doge. The doge holds the \\"ducal promise\\"Enrico Dandolo, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Enrico Dandolo was the first doge to swear this coronation oath.Louise Buenger Robbert, Reorganization of the Venetian Coinage by Doge Enrico Dandolo, page 48 The legend names the doge on the left, with his title, DVX in the field. The legend on the right names the saint as S. M. VENETI, i.e. Saint Mark of Venice. The reverse shows Christ facing, sitting on a throne. The legend abbreviates his Greek name as IC XC.Elio Biaaggi, Monete e Zecche Medievali Italiane, coin 2761. A beaded bordure on both sides of the coin prevented silver from being shaved from the edge of the coin, a practice called clipping.Alan M. Stahl, Zecca the mint of Venice in the Middle Ages, page 19 As an additional security measure, Doge Jacopo Tiepolo added distinctive marks, initially variations in the punctuation in the obverse legend and later small marks near Christ‚Äôs feet on the reverse, which identified the mint master responsible for the issues. But, except for updating the name of the doge and the addition of the reverse legend, TIBI LAVS 3 GLORIA, by Doge Michele Steno, there were no significant changes in the grosso for one hundred and fifty years. Indeed, around 1237 the doge‚Äôs coronation oath included a promise that he would not change the coinage without authorization from the council.Alan M. Stahl, Zecca the mint of Venice in the Middle Ages, page 23 Change did come, however. Between 1340 and 1370, increases in the price of silver forced most of the doges to stop issuing grossi, and the others to issue only a few.Dumbarton Oaks, Philip Grierson, and Alfred R. Bellinger Catalog of Byzantine Coins in the Dumarton Oaks Collection, page 35 When Doge Andrea Contarini resumed production of grossi their weight began to fall and continued falling until Cristoforo Moro struck the last Venetian grossi with a weight of 0.45 grams.Elio Biaggi, Monete e Zeccche Medievali Italiane, coin 2893 Influence of the Venetian grosso Republic of Venice, Grosso or 'Matapan' of Antonio Venier, Doge of Venice (1382-1400) Other Italian mints followed the example of Venice by issuing their own grossi. Verona, Bologna, Reggio, Parma and Pavia all had coins of pure silver with weights roughly that of the Venetian grosso by 1230. The Roman Senate struck grossi in the mid 13th century, but by then it was the Venetian grosso which had become a major trade currency.Philip Grierson, The Coins of Medieval Europe, pages 107 to 109. Indeed, in the 13th century, Martino da Canale claimed the Venetian grosso was \\"current throughout the world on account of its good quality\\".John Porteous, Coins In History, page 84. That brought imitations and counterfeits, especially in the Balkans. In 1282, Venice imposed restrictions on its Dalmatian possessions prohibiting the use of copies of the grosso. By 1304, the Byzantine empire issued the basilikon, whose weight and fineness made it essentially interchangeable with the Venetian grosso and whose types were clearly inspired by it. More than that, the Venetian grosso is the most prominent division point between the coinage system of Western Europe based on the penny and the era of larger silver and gold coins, collectively called groats and florins. Like the Venetian grosso, these larger denomination coins did not have names or inscriptions implying a fixed value in terms of the system of pounds, shillings and pence (or lira, soldi and denari in Italian) in which accounts were kept. This allowed the government to manipulate the values of its coins in terms of money of account as a tool for fiscal policy.

An album of it was released by Regent Records on 16 November 2009. Ledger also composed an Easter cantata with carols entitled The Risen Christ, premi√®red in the US at Washington National Cathedral on 7 May 2011 and in the UK at evensong in Canterbury Cathedral on 8 May 2011. In 2012, Ledger composed a further cantata, This Holy Child, which was first performed on 16 December 2012 at a morning church service at First Presbyterian Church, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Honours Philip Ledger was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 New Year Honours, and knighted in the 1999 Birthday Honours for services to music.

Antonio Banderas has a small role marking his film debut. Labyrinth of Passion, Almod√≥var's second film, was independently produced with a shoestring budget which allowed for better production values than his previous film Pepi, Luci, Bom, and to employ a more complex narrative. The plot follows a nymphomaniac pop star who falls in love with a gay Middle Eastern prince. Their unlikely destiny is to find one another, overcome their sexual preferences and live happily ever after on a tropical island. Although badly received by Spanish film critics, Labyrinth of Passion was a modest success and it quickly reached cult film status. The film is an outrageous look at love and sex, framed in Madrid of the early 1980s, during the so-called Movida madrile√±a, a period of sexual adventurousness between the dissolution of Franco's authoritarian regime and the onset of AIDS consciousness.  Plot  Sexilia (\\"Sexi\\") is a pop star and sex addict; Riza is the gay son of the Emperor of Tiran (a fictional Middle Eastern country). Both are strolling around Madrid's flea market, aiming to pick up lovers. Sexilia takes two men for an orgy, where she is the only woman. In the hope of curing her nymphomania and her fear of the sun, she is undergoing psychotherapy. However, her psychoanalyst, Susana, is far more interested in sleeping with Sexila's father, Doctor de la Pe√±a, a gynecologist specializing in artificial insemination. As the doctor is frigid, Susana does not have a chance with him. One of Doctor de la Pe√±a's patients is Princess Toraya, the ex-wife of the former Emperor of Tiran. Flicking through a magazine, Toraya discovers that her stepson Riza Nero is also in town. Thanks to treatment by Sexilia's father, Toraya is now fertile for the first time in her life. Since the emperor's sperm is currently unavailable to her, she will settle for that of his son, Riza, whom she attempts to track down. In Madrid, Riza is living incognito, constantly wearing a wig and dark glasses. He gets involved first with Fabio, a young junkie transvestite. Later he meets Sadec on the street and the two go to Sadec's place for a tryst. Ironically, Sadec is a member of a group of terrorists looking for Riza, but fails to recognize him in disguise. When Riza realizes that Sadec is also from Tiran, he decides to change his hair and clothes in order to protect his anonymity. With Fabio's help, Riza transforms his appearance to a punk. Sexilia and Riza, who knew each other when they were children, meet again, when Riza, disguised as \\"Johnny\\", is performing as the lead singer with a punk band in the absence of one of their regulars. That night, they fall in love but do not sleep together. The two opt for a chaste relationship since each wants this relationship to be \\"different\\". Making time in her busy schedule for her laundry, Sexilia meets Queti, a young woman who works in a dry-cleaner owned by her father. Her mother skipped out on her father a few weeks earlier and the father, who takes Vitapens to stimulate his sex drive and potency, pretends to mistake Queti for her mother and binds her to the bed and rapes her on alternate days, despite the fact that Queti regularly laces his tea with a libido-suppressing chemical called Benzamuro. In search of consolation, Queti dresses up in the clothes of her role model Sexilia. One day Sexilia spots Queti in the street wearing one of her outfits and confronts her. They become friends. Queti tells Sexilia about the problem with her father and Sexilia tells her that she cannot stop thinking about Riza. Sexilia and Riza mutual adoration has \\"cured\\" Riza's compulsive homosexuality and Sexilia's nymphomania. Queti and Sexilia hatch a plan: they agree to swap identities so that Queti can escape her father's sexual abuse and take on the role of Sexilia for real. This would allow Sexilia to escape with her lover Riza. However, Toraya finally catches up with Riza and seduces him. When Sexilia goes to Riza's hotel, she finds Toraya and Riza together. Riza tries to convince her that sex with Toraya was only practice for the real thing with her, but Sexilia is distraught. The knowledge of Riza's infidelity drives Sexilia to her psychoanalyst. Under therapy, Sexilia discovers that Toraya was responsible for both her childhood traumas and her nymphomania in the same incident that made Riza gay. Rejected by her father, she had had sex with a group of boys on the beach, while Riza looked on. Sexilia meets up with Queti, who after plastic surgery has taken her place. Queti persuades Sexilia to give Riza another chance. Sadec, who has a highly developed sense of smell and has fallen head over heels in love with Riza, is looking for him everywhere. Sadec's roommates, Islamic extremists, plan to kidnap Riza. Queti warns Sexilia and Riza of the danger and, when Toraya and the Islamic extremists arrive at the airport, Riza and Sexilia are already on the plane bound for Contadora, a tropical island. Back in Madrid, Queti, now Sexilia's look-alike, sleeps with the latter's father, whom she has always fancied; he, believing her to be Sexilia, achieves his aim of truly loving his daughter. At the airport Sadec and his companions, having lost Riza, kidnap Toraya. On the airplane Riza and Sexilia make love for the first time.

Pascual as Eusebio's girlfriend  Reception  Almod√≥var's second film received its premiere on 7 September 1982 at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival.Edwards, Almod√≥var: Labyrinth of Passion, p. 25 Produced by Alphaville, a distribution company which from 1979 had four cinemas in central Madrid dedicated to the screening of independent films, Labyrinth of Passion enjoyed a much larger budget, more sophisticated technical resources and more lavish publicity than its predecessor Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980). However, critically, the film fared badly, much worse than Pepi, Luci, Bom.Strauss, Almod√≥var on Almod√≥var, p. 28 \\"Positively bristles with vibrant colors and a wildly comic sexual energy,\\" wrote Marsha Kinder in Film Comment. Nevertheless, critical reaction was generally negative. Writing in El Periodico, JL. Guarner suggested that: \\"The story is nothing more than a series of episodes, summarily linked, and what we have come to call cinema plays little part in it. The bizarre plot does not live up to its promise, for its weakened by parallel subplots which weave in and out of it more or less haphazardly.\\" Almod√≥var said about Labyrinth of Passion: \\"I like the film even if it could have been better made. The main problem is that the story of the two leads is much less interesting than the stories of all the secondary characters. But precisely because there are so many secondary characters, there's a lot in the film I like.\\"Strauss, Almod√≥var on Almod√≥var, p. 29 Analysis Almod√≥var has mentioned Billy Wilder as an influence and has described the film as a \\"wild comedy, with lots of action and lots of characters... but without Billy Wilder's bite, because this is a very pop film.\\"Edwards, Almod√≥var: Labyrinth of Passion, p. 27 In the context of pop he has also referred to the work of Richard Lester, of A Hard Day's Night fame: \\"Films set in the city where every thing is very banal: girls and boys fall in love a lot, suffer a lot, but their suffering never involves real pain\\". Thirdly, he was influenced by the romantic melodramas of the 1950s, of which the series of films called Sissi the Empress was a prime example. The film was particularly inspired by the Shah of Iran, who at the time was still living. Almod√≥var imagined the son of the Shah coming to Madrid and used another key figure in the gossip columns, Princess Soraya, who became Toraya in the film. Through them, the director explains: \\"I wanted to tell the story of a couple that has difficulties developing their relationship. These difficulties stem from the fact that the man and the woman share the same sexual behavior.\\"Strauss, Almod√≥var on Almod√≥var, p. 22 Almod√≥var has also suggested that in making Labyrinth of Passion he experienced: \\"The difficulty of presenting a relationship in a light hearted way when beneath the surface, there lies a certain sadness.\\" Making a massive technical improvement on Almod√≥var's first feature, Labyrinth of Passion set the tone and style for the films that established his name. A gallery of colorful characters engages in an amusingly complex plot, which concludes with a taxi-cab race to the airport (reworked in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown).Edwards, Almod√≥var: Labyrinth of Passion, p. 30 A fresh-faced Antonio Banderas (who starred in a number of Almod√≥var's later films) made here his film debut as a gay terrorist, gifted with a hyper sense of smell that he uses it to track down a Prince with whom he has fallen in love. The film is notable also for Almod√≥var's appearance in full drag as a nightclub compeer. The director also plays himself at the beginning of the film in a short scene in which he directs a young transvestite junkie to butcher himself with a drill for a photo strip entitled Photo Porno Sexy Fever. Writing the script Almod√≥var's idea was to present Madrid as the world's most important city, a city everyone came to and where anything could happen. One draft of the script had Dal√≠ and the Pope meeting and falling passionately in love.Allison, A spanish Labyrinth, p. 19 That story was eventually cut, but it summed up the general idea. Labyrinth of Passion was made during the golden age of the Madrid movida, between 1977 and 1983, and almost all the key figures of the movement ‚Äì painters, musicians ‚Äì are part of the large cast.Strauss, Almod√≥var on Almod√≥var, p. 24 Depicting the hedonism of underground music venues and gay cruising grounds, the daring script shows Almod√≥var's enthusiastic embrace of Spain's new-found freedom of expression. For this reason, the film retains an emblematic power in Spain. It ran for ten years on a midnight run at Madrid's Alphaville cinema, but was released in the United States, England, France and Italy only after the success of Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. DVD release Labyrinth of Passion is available in Region 2 DVD in Spanish with English subtitles. Notes  References  * Allinson, Mark.

Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the Traunbach in the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest) in the Hunsr√ºck. Beginning on the village's outskirts is the Trauntalschleife, the award-winning hiking trail of the Saar-Hunsr√ºck-Steig, a long system of trails.

Leyen, which lay in the southeast of today's municipality, on the Traunbach, had its first documentary mention in 1367, whereas Abentheuer, to the north, is first witnessed in records in 1580. Until the 18th century, each centre still bore its own name. Today's municipal area was held by the County of Sponheim. The Traunbach then served as the border between the Hunolstein (and beginning in 1598, Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken) Amt of Achtelsbach to the west and the Sponheim Amt of Birkenfeld to the east. Over the course of its history, Abentheuer belonged either to the parish of Achtelsbach or to the parish of Birkenfeld; today it belongs to the parish of Br√ºcken. Beginning in the mid-16th century, the working of iron began, first from the pits in Buhlenberg and Elchweiler, then later from Thalfang and Schwarzenbach. In 1763, owing to economic hardship, the Abentheuer Ironworks (Abentheuerer H√ºtte) passed into the ownership of the Stumm entrepreneurial family, which already had other ironworks and hammermills in the region at its disposal. After this change in ownership, production in Abentheuer rose noticeably. From 1770, the plant's products were first and foremost cast-iron articles made from imported pig iron. In 1835, the ironworks were bequeathed to the B√∂cking brothers, who shut the works down in 1875 and moved them to the coal deposits and better shipping links on the Saar. In the late 17th century, the Hujetss√§gem√ºhle (S√§gem√ºhle means ‚Äúsawmill‚Äù in German) set up shop east of the village in the wooded valley of the Traun. By the late 19th century, it had developed into a furniture factory with several production buildings. These were abandoned in the 1960s. Also forsaken was the inn that had arisen from the sawmill.

Soon afterwards, in the decades that followed, the village managed to become a hub among the neighbouring villages, and in 1315 it became the seat of a Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit), which, besides Achtelsbach, also administered the neighbouring villages of Meckenbach and Traunen. This Pflege was a subfief from the Electorate of Trier whose immediate lords were the V√∂gte of Hunolstein. In 1480, this arrangement ended when the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken sent his own Schulthei√ü out to Achtelsbach. The territory of the Pflege was expanded to encompass first Ellweiler, and beginning in the late 18th century also Eisen and Eckelshausen. In the course of the French takeover of the Rhineland in the French Revolutionary Wars, Achtelsbach became the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù), which lasted even after the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) as an Oldenburg B√ºrgermeisterei (also ‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) until 1876. The parish of Achtelsbach was originally co√´xtensive with the Pflege, until Br√ºcken and Abentheuer were added to it. It lost influence after the Reformation and was ceded to Birkenfeld and S√∂tern (today an outlying centre of Nohfelden). It is known that there was a parish priest at the Achtelsbach church, which was consecrated to Saint Ulrich, as of 1334, although the church's beginnings stretch back further. The church itself, which has been Evangelical since the 16th century, is, with its churchtower that defines the village's skyline, Achtelsbach's most prominent building. On 9 January 2010, the belltower, and indeed the whole church, were heavily damaged in a fire.www.allgemeine-zeitung.de, retrieved 9 January 2010 Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Achtelsbach's mayor is Kai Sohns. =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent a rose foiled of six gules barbed proper and seeded Or, and sable issuant from base a lion rampant of the third armed, langued and crowned of the second. The German blazon says nothing about the rose's ‚Äúbarbs‚Äù (sepals). The rose in the escutcheon‚Äôs upper field refers to the Evangelical church in the village, which, with its enormous tower, dominates the skyline. The charge in the field below this is a reference to the village‚Äôs former allegiance to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. Moreover, the village‚Äôs old court seal also showed a lion.

In the 1970s, this former farmhouse was bought up by the boyscouts and renovated. Ever since, it has been let out to many clubs from throughout Germany, who use it regularly. Each year, several thousand visitors spend the night in the house or on the meadow next to it. Also, there is an open-house day in the autumn on which the scouting hall (Pfadfinderheim) presents itself.

In the more recent past, the Asbach Ironworks down below on the Fischbach played an important r√¥le as a regional hub for iron smelting in the early industrial revolution. This hammermill, which was expanded in 1743 by the sons of the Sulzbach smith, Johann Nikolaus Stumm, became the groundwork of the Saarland metal industry. Related to the later Barons of Stumm, the legendary ‚ÄúIron Barons‚Äù, were the B√∂ckings. In 1835, Rudolf Heinrich B√∂cking (1810-1871) inherited the ironworks.

But for an agate-grinding shop and an agricultural machinist‚Äôs operation, all households were more or less active in agriculture, although many only did so on the side. After a complete overhaul in the village‚Äôs structure, which also manifested itself in the late 1990s in the form of a thorough Flurbereinigung, there is now only one fulltime agricultural operation. For more than 25 years now there has been an agricultural processing plant, working under strict ecological rules, turning out high-quality products from its own farm. These are sold at markets in the surrounding area and also at the farm itself. In the early 1990s, a village renewal scheme was carefully undertaken to improve infrastructure. These measures, funded through cost-sharing, were at first opposed by many villagers owing to the great financial burden. It soon became clear, however, that there was no alternative. The village renewal was finished with the building of a village community centre. A few newer houses have also sprung up in the lower village as a result of a small building development zone that was opened up. In Asbacherh√ºtte is found a clinical-paedagogical institute run by the deaconry of Bad Kreuznach as a home for handicapped people who need minimal assistance. =Transport= To the south runs Bundesstra√üe 422.

It was designed and built by George McCredie during 1891. It is also known as Linwood Hall, Lynwood Hall and Guildford Truant School. The property is owned by the Cumberland Council and the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 February 2003.  History  =Indigenous history= =Colonial history= Prior to the first land grants been given in the area the Merrylands and Guildford area was set aside for use as church and school lands for the district of Parramatta. Approximately were set aside following the settlement of Parramatta as a means of raising money for the continual upkeep of churches and schools in the Parramatta area through funds raised from the use of the lands. However, much of this land was never to be used in this manner, and in 1837 the first major land grant of the area was given. Guildford was named after the Earl of Guildford, a relative of Lieutenant Samuel North, the first major landowner in the area. In the 1860s and 1870s many of these larger estates were subdivided for the first time and in 1871 a provisional school was constructed in what is now Old Guildford with the permanent school built in 1876. The Guildford area continued to grow slowly during the late 19th and early 20th century during which time the McCredie family came to the area, purchased land, and built Linnwood. During this time the area was described as a \\"busy though not populous fruit growing district\\" in 1886 and in 1888 a newspaper noted, \\"Like its name sake, the metropolis of Surrey, Guildford is a place of hills and also of fields and orchards; like the neighbouring districts it is known for its fruit.\\" Into the 20th century the area was still described as a \\"tiny village\\" and \\"almost unknown\\" but in the second decade of the century a building boom took place.\\"' In 1915 a police station, a fire station, and industry such as a brickworks, all came to the area of Guildford as it grew into a busy suburb with new residences, shops and citizens.\\" =McCredie family= George McCredie, his wife Susan, and their nine children, moved to Guildford in early 1891, having constructed Linnwood as their country home. The McCredies, and George in particular, promptly proceeded to become involved in all facets of life in Guildford. George McCredie was born in 1859 at \\"The Glebe\\" in Pyrmont Sydney, and was the son of a builder from Northern Ireland. He was educated at Fort Street Public School and left to become an apprentice carpenter with the Australasian Steam Navigation Company (ASN Co.) at the age of 14. At the age of 18 he was made a foreman and took a company of men to Townsville in North Queensland to construct the first large wharf in the area. In 1880 he married Susan Faulds Blackwood, daughter of James Blackwood of J. Blackwood and Sons Engineering Company. In 1880 he left the company and travelled overseas in a world trip and visited the \\"old country\\" to gain practical experience and to acquaint himself with the wider and larger enterprises of the rest of the world. Following his return to Australia he joined a partnership with his brother in A.L. (Arthur) & G. McCredie and Sons, Architects and Consulting Engineers, and undertook professional training at night school under the supervision of a Professor Jones. McCredie and Sons were associated with the construction of many large and important buildings in Sydney and along the waterfront and often worked for the government as private contractors to undertake their proposed works. The McCredies were involved in engineering works for warehouses, factories, stores docks and reclamation projects and were responsible for or associated with the building of many buildings around Sydney such as \\"Montana\\" in Glebe (Sydney Home Nursing Service Headquarters), George Patterson House on George Street (The Establishment), the Burns Philip Building in Bridge Street, the Mark Foy Retail Building and the Sydney GPO in Martin Place. As well as the construction of such buildings the McCredies also worked for the government on larger projects such as the planning and construction of tunnels for telephone wires throughout the city and the cleansing of The Rocks area following the outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1900. In 1891 George McCredie and his family moved from Glebe to Linnwood in Guildford and became heavily involved in the local community and political life. In 1892 he became a Justice of the Peace and in 1900 he undertook his most notable professional experience in co-ordinating the cleansing of The Rocks following the outbreak of the Bubonic Plague. A long winding gravel driveway leads to Linnwood house which is built on rising ground. The gardens were at one time extensively landscaped and featured water fountains, summer house, schoolroom and a hall where church services for the small township of Guildford were held. Linnwood was designed in the Italianate style with a central portico flanked by French windows and segmented projecting bays. A feature to be noted are the stained glass windows and doors in the main house. George became involved in the local community and was elected alderman of the Prospect and Sherwood Council and for some years served as Mayor. He had designed and constructed the maze of underground telephone cable tunnels that are still used today for that purpose and Linnwood was the first to be connected to the telephone system from Sydney. George established Presbyterian services in a hall on his property in 1894. The family lived comfortably in this quiet rural estate until George McCredie passed away, aged 44, at Linnwood of unknown causes following a period of sickness in 1903. He had been appointed by the Government to take charge of the clean up and stop the advance of bubonic plague throughout Sydney. His first priority was to inspect and assess the infected districts. Areas were cleared one at a time of the \\"accumulation of filth, the utter disregard of sanitary arrangements and numerous sad cases of poverty\\". Volunteers were understandably reluctant to assist in clearing rubbish and demolition of buildings. 17,000 rats were killed during the demolitions that stretched from the Rocks to Chippendale and also to Manly, where a further 27,548 were destroyed at the quarantine depot. As a result of the close contact with the plague, George died \\"from an illness attributed to the effects of the plague\\". He was survived by Susan Faulds McCredie and eight children (James McCredie, his son, passed away in 1895 at the age of thirteen at Rewa in Glebe). Susan McCredie later left Linnwood, initially leasing it and then selling it to the Department of Education, before moving to Wahroonga where she passed away in 1936. After George's death the community contributed money to build the neat brick George McCredie Memorial Church in Guildford Road, on land donated by the family. =Use as a state school and children's home= In November 1889, Susan McCredie was formally registered as the owner of Lots 15, 16, 17, 24 and 25 of Section of Henry Whittaker's estate, via his executor, Joseph Byrnes. Linnwood was subsequently erected on Lots 25 and 24. George McCredie witnessed the transfer, but held no interest in ownership of the land. The land was purchased for A‚Ç§750. Susan McCredie also purchased six lots adjoining the property to the North with a frontage to Guildford Road (lots 6 to 10, Sect D, DP 2403 - Vol 952 Fol 63). In June 1892, after having been elected to the Mayoralty of Prospect and Sherwood, George McCredie entertained his fellow alderman, and two local press men, at Linnwood. Near identical descriptions of the property were published in the Cumberland Mercury and the Cumberland Argus in the following week. The report notes that the house and grounds were connected to town water (the Water Supply Pipeline to the North of Linnwood was connected in 1886) and the electric lighting was generated on site. Linnwood is described not as a villa, or a mansion, but as an \\"extensive cottage\\". The interior was described as \\"comfort trenching on the confines of luxuriousness\\" - but certainly not opulence. This report confirms the others in the description of the rooms. At the rear, the breakfast room and kitchen were to the left of the court, the laundry and \\"other offices\\" to the right. For the grounds, the report describes roses, a tennis court in front of the house, \\"a Church behind the vines to the west, a range of model stables and coach-houses down south where the electric light plant is stored; a coachman's quarters fountains, a swimming bath, gigantic swings and summer-houses, growing crops, and avenues, and poultry yards. Susan McCredie also purchased a substantial amount of the surrounding land of Whittaker's Estate, including all of Sections E, F, G, and 1, and substantial parts of Sections J, L, and A. By 1901, Susan McCredie owned most of the land between Guildford Road, in the North, Byron Road to the East, Whittakers Road to the West, and Pine Road and the Great Southern Railway to the south. In December 1901, Real Estate agents Mobbs and Hunt advertised for sale most of the large area of Whitaker's Estate purchased by Susan McCredie earlier in the year. Sales of land however did not begin apace for some years. The land was advertised as comprising \\"orchard, vineyard blocks, factory, villa & business sites\\". In 1901, Susan McCredie purchased from Joseph Byrnes more allotments of land at Guildford,Vol.1368 Fol 4 including the triangular portion of land between the water pipeline and Guildford Road, on which the George McCredie Memorial Church was later erected.Lot 78 Sect A DP 2403 In May 1902, Lot 78 was transferred from Susan McCredie to her husband George, David Davidson, and Alexander George, in equal parts. All three were active committee members locally in the Presbyterian church, and it is tempting to see in this transfer an intention to alienate this land for construction of a Presbyterian church, and therefore the basis for the local lore that the McCredie family donated the land for the church. In 1890, Susan McCredie's brother, Ludovic Blackwood, had purchased land from the Whittaker Estate, acquiring Lots 18 to 23 of Section D, which adjoined the property on which Linnwood was subsequently built, and fronted Carrington. In December 1901, Ludovic Blackwood's land was transferred to Susan McCredie.Bk708 No86 However, in 1907, the same land was transferred back to her brother Ludovic. The nature or purpose of these transactions is unclear. From this time onwards, the substantial estate of Susan McCredie at Guildford was progressively sold. The sale of allotments was particularly frequent during the 1920s, especially in 1922 and 1925 providing Susan McCredie with a steady stream of income. A Sketch plan has survived on PWD files illustrating the Linnwood property at the end of Susan McCredie's period of ownership. Perhaps drawn as early as 1917, the plan has been later stamped by the Miscellaneous Branch of the Lands Department in October 1921. Aside from the house itself, other buildings on the property at the time included the summer house, the stables, cottage and shed on the Southern boundary. Near the tennis courts is a small building, which given its location may have housed sporting equipment. The property was fenced into different sections. The East portion of the land was cleared, and featured tennis courts and baths (the nature of the latter is unexplained). The entrance drive was separately fenced. Linnwood itself was surrounded by gardens, including a lawn area on the North side of the house. At the South of the main garden area, a cultivated portion was fenced off. At the rear of the site, an orchard was planted and fenced. A narrow fenced path appears to have run between the orchard and the garden from the rear service wings of Linnwood to the stables and cottage. It appears from early photos that this might have been latticed, and provided a screen between the family recreation areas and the passage of staff and workmen. This presents an insight into physical barriers to reflect class segregation at the time. Truant school In 1917, the Department of Education began looking for a suitable location for a new Truant School. A. L. Hinton, a Sydney real estate agent, was consulted, and offered several properties in the Parramatta region. In July 1917, Linnwood was included in the list of properties and the particulars of the residence and grounds were described. By September negotiations were in progress for the lease of the land from Mrs McCredie, with an option of purchasing the property during the life of the lease for (Pounds)5,000. Among the reasons for choosing Linnwood for the Truant School were its location, and ample accommodation and grounds: \\"it is more or less isolated although within easy reach of the Railway Station. There is sufficient accommodation for the staff without any additions and ample ground to provide suitable occupation for the boys after school hours. A Department of Education architect's report in September 1917, stated that Linwood was in a very good state of repair, and had only two or three slight cracks. A lease of the site from Mrs McCredie by the Crown was entered into, to commence at the beginning of December 1917. The philosophy behind the measures taken to control truancy was that truancy is \\"the vestibule of all juvenile delinquency\\". The aim of the Truant School was to avoid the truant becoming a \\"Juvenile offender\\". One such truant was the notorious Sydney Gunman \\"Chow Hayes\\" (Cameron White, NSW Heritage Office) Though the truant school itself was run by the Education Department, the policing of truancy was conducted by the Child Welfare Department. All children between the ages of 7 and 14 were, by law, required to attend school. The position of Superintendent for the new Truant School was advertised at the end of 1917, and from nine candidates, the successful applicant was Charles Dawson. The superintendent commenced duties on 1 February 1918 and the final boys were admitted on 19 March 1918. The staff consisted of the Superintendent (Charles. E. Dawson), Mrs Dawson, who was appointed as supervisor of domestic arrangements, a male attendant, a female attendant, a cook and a laundress-general. A residence, situated in of ground, was first rented and then purchased by the Department. The land has a frontage of to Byron Road and a depth of 291.7 metres. The final accommodation consisted of twelve beds. In May 1918 the accommodation was increased to 20 beds, and in December 1918 a further six beds were installed. In November 1919 an additional male attendant was appointed and the accommodation was increased to 50 by temporary arrangements which meant much congestion. \\"In April 1920 an additional female attendant was appointed. In October 1920 twenty five more beds were added and placed on outside verandahs which were most unsuitable in wet weather. In December 1920 a single portable class room with an attendant's bedroom attached, was erected. The class room was used as a dormitory. In September 1921 a nightwatchman was appointed, and in October 1921 a first assistant teacher commenced duties. In November 1921 a double portable classroom was completed. This was used as a dormitory and the single portable class room was used as a school in place of the small summer house which had been previously in use as a temporary class room. This summer house is now used as a manual training room. In November 1923 a new block of buildings containing three dormitories each holding 20 beds, a corridor, a lobby and dressing room was completed. A new W.C. block, boys' bathroom and a laundry block were also completed. Other structural alterations in the existing buildings were affected at the same time thus giving splendid accommodation for 100 inmates. In October 1924 we installed another twenty five beds thus bringing the accommodation to 100 beds. In July 1925 a new domestic water supply was installed and in August 1925 a 70cm fire service with three fire hydrants was completed. Thus the school accommodation now stands at 100 with a staff consisting of superintendent, first assistant teacher, supervisor of domestic arrangements, two female attendants, a nightwatchman, two male attendants, a cook and a laundress general\\". The Truant School was reserved for \\"confirmed and recalcitrant truants\\". The school was run like a boarding school, the boys living in dormitories and being schooled on site. The Child Welfare Department believed that its policy of sending \\"confirmed\\" truants to Guildford was, on the whole, successful. For example, in the years 1926 to 1929, between 13% and 16% of truants sent to the school returned after having been discharged. The Department could argue that this meant over 80% of truants sent to the school were \\"cured\\" of their truancy. During these years, there was also a decrease in the number of truants admitted each year, but an increase in the number of residents at any one time. During the Depression years, the Child Welfare Department recorded a substantial drop in rates of truancy across the State. This ran counter to expectations, which were that Depression would increase truancy rates. In explanation, the Department believed that the presence of unemployed parents in the home was the principal cause for the drop in truancy. With parents at home, it was believed that there was more control over children's attendance at school, not to be found when one or both parents were absent from home in the workplace during the day. By 1931, the drop in overall truancy rates also translated into a drop in the number of residents and boys being admitted to the Truant School. At the end of 1931, there were 58 boys in residence at Linnwood. On average, most boys spent around 3 to 4 months at Linnwood. The new dormitory building at the rear of Linnwood was constructed by the builder, Mr P. Cameron of Harris Park. The Dormitory additions were completed towards the end of 1923. A sketch plan, probably post 1923 as it indicates works proposed in 1921-22 and seemingly completed, illustrates the proposed location of new water pipes through Linnwood, servicing the bathroom next to the best bedroom, and the proposed bathroom in the hallway. Each of the architectural plans from the early 1920s were prepared by the Department of Education architect, John Smart. The first preliminary plan for a new dormitory building at the rear of Linnwood was prepared at the beginning of 1919. A pavilion building linked to Linnwood via a covered way. Departmental officials regarded the proposal as \\"a high expenditure for a rented property\\". It would appear that this was the primary reason for delays in providing additional accommodation. By December 1920, a handwritten note to the 1919 architect's memo stated that \\"it has been decided to purchase this property for (Pounds)5,000\\". A significant impediment to capital works on the site was thus removed. The initial plans for a new dormitory were rapidly outdated and never implemented. The desire for improved accommodation to meet the increasing needs of the school accelerated at the end of 1919, with a memorandum from Superintendent Dawson, requesting alterations to existing buildings, including a new door to the office (the former library), and laundry and bath accommodation attached to the gardener's residence. The alterations to the gardeners cottage for the baths and laundry were under construction in late 1919, thus pre-empting a more extensive package of works developed in 1921 and 1922, and implemented in 1923. A plan survives of proposals for a new door to the office, which proposed to use an existing external door from the sewing room. In 1920, the superintendent wrote several times to the Chief Inspector, indicating that the present accommodation arrangements (including beds on the verandas) were insufficient, and calling for new accommodation to be constructed along the lines already proposed. Mr Dawson was insistent, and stated that the congestion \\"leaves no room for further admissions unless I follow the suicidal method of releasing boys before they are due, of which, I must confess, I have already been guilty\\". The erection of the single and double portable classrooms commenced towards the end of 1921. A sketch plan of Linnwood in the 1922 bundle of papers presents an illustration of the existing floor plan of the building in its Truant School use. It illustrates the conversion of the building, with the dormitories located at the rear of the main building, with service rooms and staff quarters in the rear wings. A partition had been added in the middle of the hall. The superintendent's quarters were situated at the front, using the main bedroom and the drawing room. The McCredie' bathroom and dressing room had been converted to a \\"temporary bedroom\\" and bathroom with a partition installed. The dressing room at the rear on the North side appears to have been extended. This may therefore date after the 1922 plans for new works. The door to the office, the former library, had already been inserted. On the basis of these plans, a report was prepared by the architect in November 1921, and acted upon in March 1922. The report noted that the existing dormitories within Linnwood were \\"inadequately ventilated and are very much overcrowded\\". The number of boys squeezed into each dormitory was only possible because the boys changed in a common dressing room, therefore \\"leaving the dormitories free from any furniture or fitments except the beds\\". The report also notes that there was inadequate classroom space, only one classroom where there should be two. The report notes that a portable class room building was under construction at the time (1921), which was to be used at first as a temporary dormitory. It is also noted that there was an existing portable room on site, containing almost twice as many beds as it should. It was recommended that following provision of more dormitory space, this room should be converted to an \\"isolation dormitory\\". The architect concluded that the existing building could not accommodate the present, or expected needs, of the Truant School, and that the recommended option was to construct a new dormitory building at the rear of Linnwood. The simple dormitories were designed to provide \\"ample windows and doors for light and air\\", and it was noted that \\"though rather crowded they would be much superior from a health point than the present dormitories of the existing main building\\". The report notes that the office - the former library - required a public entrance to avoid people passing the Superintendent's quarters at the front of the building. It was proposed to alter a window to a doorway (see Fabric Survey). For similar reasons, it was proposed to install a screen in the hall to separate the residential quarter from the dormitories and visitors. The report goes on to note further requirements, including new lavatories and an extended dressing room, reversion to the original sewing room, conversion of the existing laundry in the rear wing to a store room and the construction of a new laundry near the drying area, and the provision of shower baths \\"in another large stable building\\". The existing shower baths were located in a detached building occupied by a teacher and his family (wife and three children), and were considered to be an intrusion on privacy, and discharged waste water to the ground nearby. The final architect's certificate for completion of the works is dated November 1923. The architect's report also includes a list of variations to the proposed works. A 1935 memorandum from the then superintendent Mr Kably to the Director of Education details the schedule of the boys at the time. Junior boys were in class during the mornings, until dinner at midday, then 1/2 hour playtime at l pm. From 1:30 to 3:30, the junior boys were engaged in gardening duties around the grounds under the supervision of an attendant. On Friday afternoons, the boys were engaged in darning and similar activities. The Senior boys were in class from 1:30 to 3:30 in the afternoons. In the mornings, the Senior boys were put to work from 9 to 11:15 in chores, such as \\"laundry work, scrubbing dining room or dormitories, window cleaning, or polishing\\". They did their gardening chores from 11:15 until dinner at midday. The memorandum notes that Linnwood had no maids, and so all domestic chores fell to the boys. At the suggestion of full- time schooling, the author made no objection, and noted that arrangements were already in place for full-time schooling for the junior boys, except Friday afternoons. A 1927 Annual Financial return for the school notes that the school raised some income from the sale of calves, indicating that at least a part of the property was used for cattle breeding. A 1929 memorandum addressed the issue of failing admissions during the preceding years. The memorandum questioned whether the Metropolitan Children's Court was making full use of the Truant School, as overall truancy numbers had not declined. During the 1930s at Linnwood, there were only just over a dozen boys at the school. Enrolments continued to drop in the 1930s, and by 1935, there were less than 20 boys at the school each week.April 1935 In the summer break of 1935 to 1936, Superintendent Dawson took long service leave, and took a study tour of the UK and the United States, looking at schooling for \\"maladjusted\\" children. Mrs Dawson was in charge during her husband's absence. It was suggested that the school be closed. From Linnwood, Mr Dawson became Principal of the Pyrmont Adjustment School. The Director of Education's report made reference to a report by Mr Dawson on the UK and US schools he examined, and his recommendation that problem boys, including truants, should not be going through the court system. The decision to close the school was also primarily a result of the dropping numbers. The remaining boys at the school were discharged on 29 November 1936, and the Guildford Truant School officially closed its doors in 1936. A female attendant continued as a caretaker after the school closed. On 28 November 1936, the Child Welfare Department took over the site for use as one of their institutions. Domestic science training school for girls Prior to opening Linnwood as a domestic science training school for female state wards, repairs were required, including renovation of the portable classrooms. Painting and repairs were required to the rooms of Linnwood, and heating needed to be installed. Converted in 1939 from the Truant school to a \\"residential domestic science school for female wards\\", Linnwood was home to 58 girls, from 12 to 15 years of age. The selection of residents was based upon those who were \\"unable to settle down in foster homes, or for other reasons are considered more suitable for the hostel type of life\\" at Linnwood. The 1961 Annual Report says that Linnwood included a school with a curriculum adapted to the \\"varying mental abilities and ages\\" of the girls. \\"Cooking, needlework and home management\\" were central to the curriculum, plus \\"special courses\\". The report notes that many girls passed public service and nursing examinations, and many were placed in \\"clerical position\\". The report also notes that the girls were taken on excursions outside the home, including to the theatre, movies, exhibitions, and picnics. Other activities included \\"ballet, drama and choral work and such handicrafts as embroidery, needlecraft and flower arrangement.\\" Sporting activities included basketball, softball and swimming. The playing fields were located on the expanse of land to the front of the house (Oral History). The girls also had their own Girl Guides troop, and on at least one occasion hiked to Prospect (Oral History). A departmental publication from 1966CWD 1966 describes the purpose and activities at \\"Lynwood Hall\\" at Guildford. The report notes that Linnwood was for girls aged from 12 to 15, from a deprived background. The report claims that \\"worthwhile goals are set and the girls are encouraged to meet them\\".CWD 1966, p.21 In addition to a \\"general emphasis on domestic science\\", an emphasis was also placed on \\"deportment, courtesy and correct social conduct\\". The report notes that organisations such as Rotary and the C.W.A were responsible for providing outings for the girls and facilitating contact with the community (a picture of the Queen presented by the CWA hangs in the central hall). Other outings included trips to the city to see the ballet (Oral History). Ballet was apparently very important at Linnwood, and girls who performed well in classes were bound to be favourites of the staff (Oral History). In Departmental literature, Lynwood Hall was described as an \\"home science training establishment\\", but which also \\"develops special courses where necessary for girls proposing to take up employment in particular avenues, e.g., commercial and industrial business and nursing\\".DCWC Annual Report, 1973: 55 Life at Linnwood, as described by former residents, appears to have been either harsh or rewarding, or both at different times and for different people. Punishments carried out at Linnwood varied depending upon the misdemeanour. Perhaps the most dreaded, was to be locked in the \\"klink\\", the small, narrow room beside the laundry at the rear of the additions to Linnwood. The window was boarded up, and the room was used as a place of solitary confinement (Oral History). Alternatively, girls who had misbehaved were made to scrub the tiled veranda floors, or the main hall, or the large dining area at the rear of the building. Another punishment was being forbidden to speak to the other girls for a period of time (Oral History). Activities for the girls at Linnwood included gardening. Plots were allocated and the best kept gardens were rewarded with prizes. The girls, like the boys before them, were also responsible for cooking. The girls were divided into groups, and each took turns to cook the meals and serve them (Oral History). Of the two kitchens at Linnwood, one was used for cooking lessons (Oral History). Another day was set aside for washing (Oral History). The girls attended school on the remaining three days. Weekends were recognised, and these were the days for outings and activities. Staff never addressed the girls by their first name according to accounts. Surnames were commonly used, which was not atypical for any boarding school environment of the time, however, accounts are that girls were also often referred to by a number only. (Oral History). On 12 July 1956, Linnwood was extensively damaged by a fire. Former girls remember the fire starting in the rear kitchen, and then spreading from there and through the roof. The interior of the principal rooms within Linnwood itself do not appear to have been directly affected. Newspaper reports of the fire mention the girls carrying furniture, bedding, clothes and crockery from Linnwood to the front lawn, and also trying to help put out the fire with hoses. Assistance was provided by local residents until the arrival of the district fire brigades. The reports confirm that the fire started at the back of the house, extensively damaging the kitchen and dining area, and then spread principally through the roof. The Dormitory building was apparently undamaged, and was to be used for accommodation until the main building was repaired (SMH). McCredie cottage was opened on 17 July 1970, to accommodate 26 preschool aged children, all wards of the State. A departmental report states that the building was the \\"first cottage home to be specially designed and constructed for preschool children\\". The report contained the following description of the philosophy behind the design of the building: \\"The needs of the children have received special consideration in the architecture, such that the home, which is in fact quite extensive, never gives the impression to its true size \\"proportions and perspective have been so designed that no child will feel overawed or dwarfed by the establishment.\\" McCredie cottage also comprised a self-contained flat for senior female wards, who would assist in the care of the children, and at the same time receive experience for future employment as live-in child care workers. Resident numbers at Linnwood Hall during the late sixties to early seventies, was within the range of 30 to 50 residents. McCredie cottage housed 26 to 28 children at any one time. Though Linnwood for example housed on average around 40 residents at a time, during the year more than twice that number were admitted, half of whom were discharged within a twelve-month period. At McCredie cottage, the total number of admissions each year was about triple the average number of residents at a time.Departmental Reports, 1971 and 1972 The Annual Report also states that the children at McCredie were there only until such a time as they could be placed in foster homes (p. 55). The opening of McCredie had assisted in reducing the demand at other facilities. (p. 9) At the end of the 1970s, McCredie cottage was adapted to also cater for children up to the age of 8. Faulds House was opened on 23 April 1976. It was designed to provide accommodation for girls who were of primary and high school age, and attended local schools. The intention, according to the Department, was to provide \\"a family type setting with minimum restrictions\\" The report also noted that upon opening Faulds House, Linnwood was closed and renovated, \\"to be reopened as a hostel for working age girl wards\\". Married couples were in charge of Faulds. Some girls would stay at Faulds until transferred into foster homes. Others who stayed at Faulds continued in schooling to School Certificate level. In 1977, Linnwood was described as a \\"Group House\\" by the department. In the 1980s, Linnwood was used as a hostel for State Wards up to the age of 16. There was room at this time for 16 wards in the building, male and female. They paid for their board, and were given a degree of independence. The aim of the managers was to teach the teenagers to cope on their own, and an emphasis was placed on teaching living skills (1984 Newspaper Article). In 1991, a reunion was held at Linnwood, attended by 75 former residents. In later years (e.g. 1995), Linnwood was used by the Auburn/Holroyd Disability Services Branch of the Department of Community Services.Parramatta Advertiser, 20/11/95 In 1996, it was noted that no children had lived in Linnwood itself for three years (1993). In 1996, staff and students from Minali, another DOCS home, were relocated to Linnwood, as well as an Education department \\"assessment and tutorial service and an outreach and aftercare service\\".DOCS, 1996:20 =Linnwood Museum= In 1984, a plan to provide a museum at Linnwood was advertised. On 21 March 1985, The Department of Community Services granted a license to the Holroyd and District Historical Society, to operate the \\"Linnwood Museum\\", from the building. In September of that year, the museum was officially opened by the then Minister for Youth and Community Services, Frank Walker. The Friends of Linnwood Hall was formed in 2002 following a successful community campaign to save it from being sold and redeveloped by the NSW Department of Education. The group has since raised $200,000 towards restoration works for the historic house.Stevens, 2015 In January 2002 Minister Yeadon announced that control of the property would be transferred to the NSW Heritage Office. A steering committee was formed with representatives from the Heritage Office, Heritage Council, Holroyd City Council and the community. Control of the whole site was transferred to the Heritage Office on 30 June 2002 (Draft CMP: Linnwood.City Plan Heritage 2001 Holroyd City Council debated handing back control of Linnwood Hall to the state government in November‚ÄìDecember 2015, after a proposal to subdivide the land and use sale proceeds to fund its restoration have been stalled. Council will proceed with plans to subdivide the land and use proceeds from the Tamplin Road Reserve sale towards restoration of Linnwood house, following a series of meetings with the Heritage Division to address long-running delays.Stevens, 24/3/16  Description  ;Setting: Linnwood Hall is located in Holroyd, south of Guildford. The residence sits high on a north-south running ridge within spacious grounds of about with mature trees. Several other early elements from the initial phase of development of the property are evident within this curtilage including an unusual octagonal summerhouse, several mature trees and fountains. The original entrance is marked by substantial chamfered timber gate posts with unusual cast iron orb finials. The accompanying concrete post, pipe rail and wire mesh fence probably dates from the early 20th century. The drive is now bitumen paved. A long winding gravel driveway leads to Linnwood house which is built on rising ground. The gardens were at one time extensively landscaped and featured water fountains, summer house, schoolroom and a hall where church services for the small township of Guildford were held. The site retains many early tree plantings (including Araucaria cunninghamii/hoop pines, camphor laurels), garden layout (including the entrance drive, garden features such as outbuildings, an iron fountain and the iron railing fence to street), large plantings (such as giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) remain, along with later plantings from the 20th century such as a grove of eucalypts along the entrance drive. A sinuous curved drive leads to the main house from Byron Road running close to the site's northern boundary. This drive is lined with mature Eucalypts (many lemon scented gums, Corymbia citriodora (syn. Eucalyptus citriodora)(mid 20th century plantings) and some older trees including Canary Island palms (Phoenix canariensis), black bean (Castanospermum australe), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), coral trees (Erythrina spp.), Himalayan or deodar cedar (Cedrus deodara), brush box (Lophostemon confertus), African olive (Olea africana), mulberry (Morus alba), firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica), plums (Prunus cerasifera cv.s). Shrubs include hibiscus (H.rosa- sinensis), frangipani (Plumeria rubra), jade bush (Portulacaria afra), Himalayan jasmine (Jasminium mesnyii), Photinia glabra (popular hedge species), Cape honeysuckle or tecoma (Tecomaria capensis) (also a popular hedge species), 2 species of privet, (Ligustrum ovalifolium and L.vulgare), and herbaceous plants Indian shot (Canna indica), red hot pokers (Kniphofia spp.) and Adam's bayonet (Yucca gloriosa).Stuart Read, pers. Comm., 2002 visit. ;Structures: There are four primary building structures located on the property. *McCredie is located to the south east on the front boundary of the property; * Linnwood Hall is predominately at the centre of the property. It is a large single storey Italianate style villa residence. It features separately roofed verandahs to the front (east) and side (north and south) elevations. The central main entry on the front elevation is marked by a small hipped portico breaking the line of the skillion roof verandah in the centre of the elevation. The portico is accessed via a small flight of rendered masonry steps. The portico is flanked by French windows and segmented projecting bays. The building is constructed of rendered masonry and features flanking bays at the ends of the verandahs and french doors. The main roof is hipped and of slate, some parts are clad with corrugated iron. A feature to be noted are the stained glass windows and doors in the main house. The interior features much intact original fabric and detailing, including stained glass windows imported from England, set plaster walls and ceilings and timber floors; *Isaacs is located to the west of Linnwood Hall; and *Faulds is located on the south of the property. Each building is constructed of a combination of brick, concrete and timber.Lavelle 2001. Other structures includes two swimming pools located on the property, the first located in front of Linnwood Hall, the second immediately behind McCredie Cottage. Both are covered with sheet iron supported by a timber structure. = Condition = As at 6 March 2002, historic photographs show intensively developed grounds with ornamental flower beds, statues, fountains and gravel drives or paths. Because most of the old garden area is now covered by lawn, it is likely to have been little disturbed and therefore has high archaeological potential to retain evidence of the early landscaping. Areas within the main building which are likely to have archaeological potential include underfloor and foundation areas, wall cavities and roof spaces. Where deposits have not been removed by subsequent disturbance or misadventure (building works, repairs, etc.) they may be expected to yield information relevant to the original construction and occupation of the building.Lavelle 2001 Many early tree plantings (including Araucarias, camphor laurels), garden layout (including entrance drive, and garden features such as outbuildings, an iron fountain, iron railing fence to street), large plantings (such as giant bamboo) remain, along with later plantings from the 20th century such as a grove of eucalypts along the entrance drive. Such a relatively intact large urban garden retaining early structure, plantings and detail is increasingly rare today.S. Read, July 2002. The fencing which borders most of the property is considerably deteriorated and the property generally has been poorly maintained in recent years. The main gate posts remain although their paint is peeling off and in poor condition.S. Read, visit, 26 August 2010. Much of the building and curtilage are intact. Grounds include many original elements. Modifications are reversible. = Modifications and dates = The main residence has been adaptively re-used over many years to provide institutional care facilities for live-in clients of the Department of Community Services. There has been some intervention in original fabric of the residence, however, it is not irreversible. On 17 March 2011 the Minister approved creation of two Crown Reserves over the Linnwood Hall Estate. One contains all buildings and heritage cartilage and will be managed by Holroyd Council. The other covers the open space fronting Tamplin Road, will be managed by the Land and Property Management Authority (LPMA).Kelly, press release, 17/3/11  Heritage listing  As at 14 November 2007, Linnwood, including its associated buildings and landscape, is of state significance as a welfare site that was in operation and use for over 80 years. Since 1917, the site was continually adapted and developed specifically for various welfare uses such as housing and educating state wards. Of particular significance is the use of Linnwood as the first and only Truant School that was in existence in NSW between 1917 and 1936 and was later used by the Department of Welfare as a Girls Home Science Domestic School for state wards. Linwood is also significant as an example of a prominent and wealthy city businessman's country retreat that was constructed on a large estate beyond the then outskirts of Sydney. The size and fine detail of this late Victorian residence demonstrates the wealth, aspirations and lifestyle of this class in society. Specifically, Linnwood is in part representative of its original designer and occupier George McCredie. George McCredie was prominent for a time in the local community through his involvement in the political arena and in community activities. On a broader level George McCredie is known historically for his role in conducting the cleansing of The Rocks following the outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1900, and the building activities of his family firm A.L. & G. McCredie and Sons. The remnant of Linwood estate can still demonstrate by its scale within its urban setting the former extent of the land holdings of Susan McCredie, who was also a prominent local figure in her own right.City Plan and Heritage Office. Linnwood was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 February 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Linnwood is significant as a late 19th century country retreat constructed by a prosperous city businessman demonstrating a pattern of land use that occurred during this time beyond the outskirts of Sydney. Linnwood is historically representative of the wealth and aspirations of this class of Late Victorian Sydney self made men, and also demonstrates the extensive local landholdings of Susan McCredie. From 1917 to 1936 Linnwood was the first and only Truant School to exist in NSW. It is representative of a period in the history of NSW Education practice when truancy was a prevalent problem in government run schools. The recognition of this problem is in part due to the regulation of school attendance as part of the Public Instruction Amendment Act 1916. At this time truancy was considered an anti-social activity, that if not curtailed would eventually lead to delinquency. The Guildford Truant School at Linnwood was part of the Department of Education's attempt to rectify this problem. Linnwood is associated with state organised welfare activities in NSW. The Truant School, the Domestic Science School and McCredie Cottage Child Care Centre, Faulds House, as well as other, more recent welfare uses, demonstrate a continuous use of the site for these purposes for over 80 years. It is associated with the practice of the NSW government to educate female wards in domestic practices thereby preparing them for the adult world. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Linnwood Hall is associated with George McCredie, a significant figure in the cultural history of the local area, and to a lesser extent of NSW. As a mayor of the local municipality, state parliamentary member for the local Cumberland electorate and for his heavy and enthusiastic involvement in community affairs of the Guildford area including the Presbyterian Church and the Guildford Cricket Club, George McCredie was a prominent citizen in the local area between 1890 and 1903. His wife, Susan McCredie, was also a prominent member of the community, and maintained a respected profile in the local area after George McCredie's death. George McCredie is significantly associated with the history of NSW primarily through his management and action of cleansing The Rocks area in Sydney following the outbreak of the bubonic plague in 1900. George McCredie was contracted by the City to carry out the cleansing process which included the resumption of many buildings in the area, the cleaning of drains and sewers and catching and destroying rats. George McCredie's photographic records of The Rocks cleansing is an invaluable state significant historical resource. George McCredie and his company A.L. & G. McCredie & Sons, Architects and Consulting Engineers, were responsible or associated with the construction of many of Sydney's prominent buildings such as George Patterson House, the Burns Phillip Building, Mark Foys, and many of the former wharves in Darling Harbour. The firm was also responsible for the laying of the first underground telephone lines through tunnels beneath Sydney's streets and pavements. Linnwood and the associated buildings on the site are significant for their association with the large number of state wards and truants that resided, and were schooled there, between the years of 1917 and 1999, notably the gangster Chow Hayes. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Linnwood is a reasonably well preserved example of a late Victorian country retreat constructed by a prosperous Sydney businessman. The house, constructed in a slightly Italianate style, featured quality internal decoration and pleasure gardens displaying the high aspirations of the McCredies. The size, construction and detail (internal and external) of the dwelling give it considerable architectural significance in the local area. McCredie Cottage is a purpose designed building that makes it significant for its demonstration of the architect's intention, and the prevalent \\"Sydney School\\" of design at the time. Originally designed to house pre-school age state wards, the cottage was designed to be of a smaller, non threatening scale so that children would be more comfortable in their own environment. Linnwood Hall and its grounds has, since the period of construction, exhibited and retained landmark qualities in the local area due to the aesthetic character of the dwelling and it associated landscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Linnwood Hall, particularly its grounds, are socially significant to the local Guildford community for the continuing association of the site with the local community through its use for community and social activities. Presently the community responds to Linnwood and the site for its aesthetic and landmark qualities, and views it as a valuable community resource. Linnwood Hall is associated with the many groups of children and state wards that lived, schooled and worked at the site at various times. Linnwood contributes to the identity of this extensive and diverse community, and greatly impacted upon their life. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Linnwood and its surrounding landscape is evidence of the use and moulding of the landscape to create a country estate. The site provides evidence of this pattern of land use in the local area. McCredie Cottage and Faulds House are evidence of purpose designed welfare dwellings. McCredie cottage is particularly significant as it was designed specifically for the preschool age children that would inhabit it. Linnwood is evidence of the conversion of a late Victorian residence for specific welfare and education uses such as the Truant School and the Domestic Science School. Linnwood is evidence of a \\"welfare site\\" that was continually adapted over the course of eighty years in order to meet specific use requirements in regards to the housing and education of particular groups of state wards in NSW. The site is likely to have a high level of archaeological potential, owing to a limited degree of site disturbance. The demolished remains of the original stables and cottage at the South West corner of the site are likely to be fairly undisturbed. The site is also likely to reveal evidence of former paths, outbuilding, drains, waste disposal, gardens and fences. There is a remote possibility that the footings of the 1894 Linnwood Hall church may be located in the vicinity of the Western boundary of the site. The significance of archaeological remains on the site is relative to the overall significance of the property. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Linnwood, as an example of a late Victorian country retreat constructed by a prosperous city businessman, is a rare survivor in the local area. The use of Linnwood as a Truant School is rare in NSW. The Guildford Truant School was the only one of its kind in the history of NSW education/welfare. The continual use, development and adaptation of the site for various welfare and education purposes, for over 80 years, is rare in the history of NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Linnwood is a reasonably intact representative example of a late Victorian residence constructed in a slightly Italianate style, as a country home. Faulds House and McCredie Cottage are representative of the use of the site for specific welfare purposes, and of the Sydney School of architecture translated into Government institutional buildings.

Bicycles of this type are also called easy bikes/EZBs, flat foot bikes (from Electra's 'Flat Foot Technology'), laid back bikes, semi-recumbent/semi-bent bikes and ground-reach bikes (Lightfoot Cycles). The term \\"crank forward\\" was created by Rans Designs, a manufacturer of bicycles based in Hays, Kansas. It is a protected term that Rans uses for a group of bicycles that they manufacture, but the term is used by the bicycle community to describe bikes sharing certain characteristics made by other manufacturers also. The main functional difference of a crank forward bicycle is that the seat can be set closer to the ground while maintaining the correct leg extension to the pedals. This allows the rider to place their feet on the ground without getting off the seat. The crank is not so far forward, though, that a seat back is necessary, as in a semi-recumbent or recumbent bike.

It is part of series of ten portraits made for the psychiatrist √âtienne-Jean Georget and is currently kept in the Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent, Belgium. Background The painting belongs to a series of ten portraits of the insane inmates of Salp√™tri√®re asylum in Paris.B√°rbara Eschenburg e Ingeborg G√ºssow, ¬´El Romanticismo y el Realismo ¬ª, in Los maestros de la pintura occidental, Taschen, 2005, p 427 () G√©ricault made it nearly the end of his career and the five remaining portraits from the series represent the painter's last triumph. Psychiatrist √âtienne-Jean Georget, one of the founders of social psychiatry, asked G√©ricault to do this painting which would represent each clinical models of disease.Eitner, Lorenz, \\"Introduction\\", Th√©odore G√©ricault, Salander-O'Reilly, 1987, p 5,6 Georget believed that dementia was a modern disease, which depended in large part of social progress in industrialized countries. He believed that the madmen who were mentally ill need help. Instead of bringing the ill persons in a class room to examine their physical characteristics, the doctor instructed G√©ricault to paint models representing different types of madness. Dr. Georget much appreciated the objectivity in this series of works that established a link between romantic art and empirical science. Description The work was made quickly, which prefigured the concerns of the Impressionists. However, the painting did not belong to Impressionism. At the time, to give dignity to those who were mentally ill was new: they were generally excluded from society,P.F.R. Carrassat, Maestros de la pintura, special editions, S.L., 2005. , p 196 and the previous works represented madmen as possessed creatures or ludicrous people, according to a medieval belief. G√©ricault tried to show objectively the patient's face: the empty gaze of the kleptomaniac goes to infinity and his face is rigid, with a neglected beard and dirty neck. The paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in G√©ricault's family, as well as the artist's own fragile mental health.Patrick Noon: Crossing the Channel, page 162.

The Magpie is a British breed of domestic duck. It has distinctive black and white markings reminiscent of the European magpie, and is a good layer of large eggs.  History  The Magpie was bred after the end of the First World War by M.C. Gower-Williams in Wales and Oliver Drake in Yorkshire. The ancestry of the breed is not known; it may have included the Indian Runner, possibly with some influence of the Huttegem of Belgium. The Magpie is first documented in 1920; a breeders' club was formed in 1926. At that time, two colour varieties were recognised, black-and-white and blue-and- white. The black-and-white remained the only colour recognised by the Poultry Club of Great Britain until 1997, when blue-and-white and dun-and-white were recognised. The Altrheiner Elsterenten, a duck with same plumage pattern as the Magpie, was bred in Germany in the 1970s by Paul-Erwin Oswald. The Entente Europ√©enne treats it as the same breed. The Magpie was exported to the United States in 1963, but was not widely kept. It was admitted to the American Standard of Perfection in 1977. Characteristics Named for its distinctive black and white plumage, reminiscent of the colouration of the European magpie, the typical example of the breed is predominantly white with two large black areas on the back and top of the head. As the bird ages the black cap will normally begin to be flecked with white and may eventually become completely white. Blue, silver and chocolate which is very rare, are also colour varieties that Magpies can come in. However, blue is the only other variety besides black that is recognised by the American Poultry Association. Similar in shape to the Khaki Campbell, but more substantial, the Magpie is moderately streamlined with a somewhat upright carriage that suggests Indian Runner duck in its ancestral bloodline. The bill is yellow or orange, but turns green in older birds. The legs and feet are orange but may be mottled. The chest is rounded and the neck moderately long. Males have, when fully feathered, curled feathers on the tail. Females have, when fully feathered, straight feathers on the tail. Males weigh around on average, and females around , although the American standard specifies lower for each. They lay between 220‚Äì290 large white eggs annually. They are a hardy variety, active foragers, and live for approximately 9 to 12 years.

History About 500 BC, the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived, settled here. Their area of settlement was framed by the rivers Ahr, Rhine and Nahe. All indications are that it was these Treveri who built the ringwalls at the Wildenburg as a refuge castle when, in the last century before the Christian Era, they were beset first by Germanic tribes and then later by the Romans, who under Julius Caesar‚Äôs leadership enjoyed a number of successes that led to Roman hegemony throughout the Treveri's homeland. It became the Roman province of Belgica, whose boundary ran from somewhere near the Stumpfer Turm, where the important Celtic-Roman centre of Belginum lay, southwards to the ridge of the Idar Forest, along the ridge for a way before turning southwards again somewhere between Sensweiler and Wirschweiler, whence it ran to the Idarbach, crossed it by way of the Ringkopf, then running down the Siesbach to the river Nahe. While the lands west of this line formed Belgica, the lands to the east, including Bruchweiler, belonged to the Roman province of Germania Superior, whose capital was at Mogontiacum (Mainz). In later centuries, the border alignment mentioned above became the boundary between the Nahegau and the Moselgau (a territory that stretched along the Moselle), and after the 843 Treaty of Verdun, the boundary between Middle Francia and East Francia, two of the three entities into which Charlemagne‚Äôs old empire was split by that treaty. Roman rule lasted 450 years in the Bruchweiler area. Interesting archaeological finds were made within Bruchweiler‚Äôs limits in 1922, and again in 1947 and 1948. All together, six cist graves, each measuring some 50 √ó50 cm, with grave goods, were unearthed, dating from the late 2nd or 3rd century. In 1885, a trove of 26 coins was found on the Wildenburg Heights, among them some with Emperor Maximinus Thrax‚Äôs (ruled 235-238) effigy. Even earlier, in 1839, on the terracelike area southwest of the forester‚Äôs house, a Roman bath complex had been dug up, leading to the conclusion that there must have been a Roman settlement there. In Late Roman times, about AD 350, a watch and signalling station may have been built by the Romans on the high quartzite cliffs with their broad view over the countryside to guard against Germanic incursions. In the 5th century, Roman hegemony was destroyed by the Franks, who were thrusting into the area from the east. Little is known about Frankish times in the Bruchweiler area, although placenames nearby ending in ‚Äîrath, ‚Äîroth, ‚Äîrodt or ‚Äîert are undoubtedly Frankish foundings, referring as they do to the Franks‚Äô customary practice when settling new land, namely clearing the woods (German still uses the verb roden to mean ‚Äúclear‚Äù). The Franks were also instrumental in the introduction of Christianity into the area. When Charlemagne introduced the Gau system, Bruchweiler found itself in the Nahegau. Heading the Gau was a Gaugraf (‚ÄúGau Count‚Äù), who was the king's official, and who could, as such, be replaced at any time. However, in a rather short time, Gaugraf came to be more and more an hereditary post held by Gaugraf families. Beginning in 960, one such family cropped up in the Nahegau: the Emichones. Beginning in the mid 11th century, the Emichones were known to hold the countship and its attendant fief as heritable property, and they were also Imperially immediate princes. The Emichones were related to the Frankish Imperial dynasty, the Salians, whose family holdings lay in the Middle Rhine area. As a result of the fief law decreed by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, all fiefs, great and small, became heritable property. Also belonging to the Emichones‚Äô main line beginning in 1103 were the Wildgraves. After several partitions of the Waldgraviate ‚Äì to which belonged Schmidtburg, Kyrburg, Dhaun and Grumbach ‚Äì Bruchweiler, and Kempfeld, too, passed in 1282 to Gottfried von Kyrburg. In 1328, the Wildenburg (castle) was built by Friedrich von Kyrburg. After the Schmidtburg, Dhaun and Kyrburg Waldgraves died out in the male line, the whole Waldgraviate passed to the last Wildgrave's son-in-law, Rhinegrave John III (whose last comital seat was Rheingrafenstein Castle near Bad M√ºnster am Stein-Ebernburg) as an inheritance. Thereafter, his noble house called itself ‚ÄúWild- and Rhinegraves‚Äù. Even after several lines emerged as the result of division of inheritance, this comital house remained one of the most powerful lordly houses between the Moselle and the Nahe, until Napoleon annexed the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank in 1798 after the French Revolution. As for the local people themselves, in Frankish-Early German times, they were all free peasants with the same rights. However, under the Heerbanngesetz (‚ÄúArmy Ban Law‚Äù), all free peasants had to perform long defence drills and military service, which made tending their fields properly ever more difficult. To free themselves from military service, many free peasants transferred their farms to a lord's ownership so that the lord could then enfeoff the peasant with the same farm. Although this released the peasant from military service, it did mean that he then had to pay tributes to his lord. Since all power, prestige and income was linked to land ownership, each lord sought to expand his holdings by amassing as many of these small feudal landholds as he could and adding them to his own holdings. Thus, over centuries, all land ended up being held by lords, both secular and ecclesiastical. Bruchweiler belonged, within the Waldgraves‚Äô and Rhinegraves‚Äô holdings, to the Amt of Wildenburg, where the count's Amtmann (\\"bailiff\\") could more or less do whatever he deemed fit, without any meaningful constraints on his power locally. It may be supposed that the villages in the Bruchweiler area already existed in the 10th century and that, indeed, they had already arisen by Roman times. Places with names ending in ‚Äîweiler might originally have earned that placename ending from the Latin word villa, meaning a lone house or an estate (modern-day German still uses Weiler as a standalone word meaning ‚Äúhamlet‚Äù). The assumption is strengthened by the Roman graves found in the Bruchweiler area (see above). In Bruchweiler, the Count of Sponheim-Kreuznach, too, had several subjects who were obliged, whenever the bell sounded the Waffengeschrey (‚Äúcall to arms‚Äù), to do the Waldgrave's bidding. Sponheim was forbidden to hold more than four estates in Bruchweiler. This was stipulated in a document issued by Waldgrave Emich von Kyrburg and Count Johann von Sponheim in 1279 (which, among other things, also gave Bruchweiler its first documentary mention as bruchvillare). That was the time of Faustrecht (‚ÄúFist Law‚Äù), in which feuds and other violence were the order of the day as lords tried to emerge over others as the dominant rulers. Taxes and services were a hefty burden in the Middle Ages on the inhabitants. As well as the Besthaupt (‚Äúbest head‚Äù, that is, head of cattle), the payment from a serf's estate upon his death to the Wildenburg of his best head of cattle, there were also the Schatzung (a direct tax), the Bede (ground rent), endless tithes and compulsory labour for the lord. By 1546, Martin Luther‚Äôs teachings had found their way into many municipalities in the Hunsr√ºck. After the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, which granted landed lords the right to determine their subjects‚Äô religion (cuius regio, eius religio), the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves openly embraced Luther's teachings and introduced the Reformation into their lands. Morning and afternoon peals were introduced to remind people to pray. The church in Bruchweiler belonged to the parish of Wirschweiler. The church building that stands today was built in 1744. Bruchweiler is an autonomous parish tied with Sensweiler through a personal union. The Thirty Years' War wrought upon Bruchweiler ‚Äì as it did upon every part of Germany ‚Äì great havoc. As early as 1620, the village was hosting 25,000 Spaniards and Walloons fighting on the Imperial side. Since the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves had sided with the Swedes, though, this was a dire situation. For a time, there was also a Swedish occupation. The conditions were bleak. In 1635, two thirds of the inhabitants had died. What the troops did not destroy was taken away by the Plague and hunger. It was at this time that the village of Schalwen near Kempfeld was utterly wiped out. The peace concluded at M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck took a long time to bring about anything resembling normalcy. Mercenaries who had been released from service went about the countryside begging and plundering. Because this problem seemed neverending in the Bruchweiler area, with its hordes of Lothringer (‚ÄúLorrainians‚Äù) always causing trouble, the Rhinegrave forged an agreement with the Elector of the Palatinate whereby each would help the other protect his territory from the marauders. To this end, a force of 2,000 men ‚Äì 1,700 foot soldiers and 300 mounted men ‚Äì was assembled. The Rhinegrave's and Count Palatine's efforts notwithstanding, the ‚ÄúLorrainian‚Äù horde managed to take the Wildenburg in 1652 and to destroy it. When in the wake of the Thirty Years' War German kings‚Äô power had declined and Germany had splintered into more than 300 statelets, some of the king's rights passed to the princes. Among the Waldgraves‚Äô and Rhinegraves‚Äô lordly rights by 1648 were military, judicial and customs authority, the right to mint coins and all mining rights. These rights represented important income sources for the lord, as other lordly rights pertaining to water, forest, grazing land, hunting and fishing always had. The wounds inflicted by the Thirty Years' War had not yet healed when King Louis XIV's forces thronged into the Hunsr√ºck, taking the Wildenburg. People from throughout the area had to do compulsory labour, building the fort of Montroyal (near Traben-Trarbach). If indeed the Wildenburg had ever served as a stronghold guarding the Waldgraves‚Äô and Rhinegraves‚Äô holdings in the Bruchweiler area, it was now losing that function. By this time, the castle was little more than a ruin. Firearms, now in common use, had rendered mediaeval fortifications almost useless anyway, and little work was ever again done to restore the castle. Later, the Amtshaus, built in 1660, served the purpose of administration. The Wildenburg nevertheless remained the embodiment of the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial high jurisdiction and lordship. After the commotion and destruction wrought by the Thirty Years' War and the time that followed, there was enormous growth in the demand for ironware and iron equipment. In response, new ironworks, iron and copper smelters and hammermills soon arose. As early as 1670, the Asbacher H√ºtte (Asbach Foundry) came into being, which drew its ore from mines near Niederw√∂rresbach and Berschweiler, where rich iron deposits had been discovered. Joining the foundry in 1714 were the Hammer Birkenfeld ‚Äì popularly called the Schippenhammer ‚Äì and the steel- and hammermill in Sensweiler. There were also the Katzenloch hammermill, opened in 1758, and the Allenbach copper smelter, which in 1802 was converted to an iron hammermill. At the hammermills, the iron produced by the Asbach Foundry was wrought into various kinds of ironware. Besides smiths, charcoal makers and goods transporters were first and foremost needed. Slowly, the ironworks once again allowed trade and business to blossom. Hundreds of families from the local area were working and earning a living at the Stummsche H√ºttenwerke by the late 18th century, be it as sand mould makers, pourers, modellers, metal engravers, charcoal makers, ore miners or goods transporters. The ironware made at the ironworks was shipped in all directions, to Mainz, Koblenz, Cologne, Trier, Luxembourg and other places. The French Revolution also had its historical consequences for the Bruchweiler area. In 1792, French Revolutionary troops advanced across the Hunsr√ºck as far as Mainz. The whole area on the Rhine's left bank was occupied by the French. To what was left of the feudal system, fiefs, princes and serfdom was put a quick end. On 7 March 1798, the Amt of Wildenburg ceased to exist, and with the new division of administration, the Bruchweiler area found itself in the arrondissement of Birkenfeld in the Department of Sarre. Bruchweiler itself was grouped into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Hottenbach in the canton of Herrstein. Serfdom was abolished, and some other improvements for personal freedom, such as right of abode, were introduced. Even so, the compulsory labour and all the taxes and tithes that had characterized pre- Revolutionary times were gone, only to be replaced by French taxes that were every bit as heavy. One thing that made clear how disorderly the times around 1800 were was the crime, particularly robbery. Schinderhannes (Johannes B√ºckler) then held the people under his spell. French hegemony came to an end in 1814. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Bruchweiler area found itself on 22 April 1816 in the Kingdom of Prussia. It was then that the Regierungsbezirk of Trier arose; the Bernkastel district was also newly formed. At first, Bruchweiler was grouped into the Amt of Rhaunen, but in 1851 it was transferred along with Kempfeld and Schauren to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Wirschweiler. In 1886, the administrative seat was moved to Kempfeld. Bruchweiler's population figure in 1680 was given as 14 families. By 1698 this had fallen to only 5 families. *1740 ‚Äì 10 families *1802 ‚Äì 174 inhabitants *1809 ‚Äì 180 inhabitants *1849 ‚Äì 319 inhabitants *1882 ‚Äì 400 inhabitants The strong growth in the population in the 19th century can be traced to the influence and development of the iron industry in neighbouring villages. Bruchweiler experienced a surge about 1846. Agate polishing gained a foothold in the village. Even today, gemstones are skilfully cut and polished in workshops. Even into the time after the Second World War, agriculture was always the local inhabitants‚Äô main income earner. The Flurbereinigung undertaken between 1934 and 1938 allowed farm mechanization to quickly make great strides, although a full set of farm machinery was only worth having for bigger farms. This led to a considerable fall in the number of smaller farms, especially after 1948. This in turn led to a shift in the village's economic structure, one that became all the more obvious in 1955 when a technical stone factory ‚Äì one in which stone is processed into useful articles ‚Äì opened, as well as the realization that some 50 inhabitants were commuting to work every morning on postbuses to jobs that lay outside the village, mainly in Idar- Oberstein. It was also after the war that a new neighbourhood arose in the village, a residential area in whose middle stands a school building dating from 1956. The municipality's population is now above the 500 mark.Bruchweiler‚Äôs history Since 1946, Bruchweiler has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Until administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969, Bruchweiler belonged to the now abolished district of Bernkastel.

The German blazon does not specify the distribution of the ‚Äúcubes‚Äù, called ‚Äúsilver square stones‚Äù in the original German. ‚ÄúSquare‚Äù cannot be used in the English blazon as this refers to a different charge, namely an L-shaped carpentry tool.James Parker on the ‚Äúsquare‚ÄùJames Parker on the ‚Äúcube‚Äù The escutcheon‚Äôs dexter (armsbearer‚Äôs right, viewer‚Äôs left) side refers by its tinctures (gules and argent, or red and silver) to the arms once borne by the Counts of the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim. The ‚Äúsquare stones‚Äù symbolize the four Sponheim free estates within the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial domain. The charge on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side, the lion rampant, is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate.Description and explanation of Bruchweiler‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Evangelical church, Hochwaldstra√üe 5 ‚Äì aisleless church with ridge turret, 1744-1746; d√©cor * Hochwaldstra√üe 2 ‚Äì Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), partly timber-frame, half-hipped roof, earlier half of the 19th century References External links * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Birkenfeld (district) ","title":"Bruchweiler"},{"id":"11881339","text":"Br√ºcken or Brucken may refer to: Places in Germany *Br√ºcken, Birkenfeld, municipality in the district of Birkenfeld, Rhineland-Palatinate *Br√ºcken, Kusel, municipality in the district of Kusel, Rhineland-Palatinate *Br√ºcken, Saxony-Anhalt, municipality in the district of Mansfeld-S√ºdharz, Saxony-Anhalt People *Claudia Br√ºcken (born 1963), German singer who fronted the groups Propaganda and Act *Gerard von Brucken Fock (1859‚Äì1935), classical Dutch pianist, composer and painter ","title":"Br√ºcken"},{"id":"11881365","text":"Breitenthal (Hunsr√ºck) (Hunsr√ºckisch: Br√§nel) is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Birkenfeld district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the slope down from the Hunsr√ºck into the Nahe valley south of the Idar Forest in an area facing east inside a bend in the river Hosenbach. In the southwest, the land slopes off steeply near the municipal limits into the Fischbach valley. Breitenthal's range of elevations is 187 m, from its lowest point of 330 m above sea level at the foot of the Schielenbach (), to its highest of 517 m above sea level in the Sangwald/Jungenwald (forest; ). =Land use= Breitenthal's total area measures 368 ha (3.68 km¬≤), which breaks down thus: * Woodlands ‚Äì 44.9% * Farmland ‚Äì 43.3% * Residential and transport ‚Äì 11.1% * Open water ‚Äì 0.3% * Other ‚Äì 0.4% =Neighbouring municipalities= Breitenthal borders on Oberhosenbach, Wickenrodt, Niederhosenbach, Herrstein, M√∂rschied and Weiden. The nearest major town is Idar-Oberstein on the Deutsche Edelsteinstra√üe (‚ÄúGerman Gem Road‚Äù). =Geology= Geologically, the Breitenthal area is characterized by slate (stratigraphy: Hunsr√ºck slate; petrography: claystone and siltstone with traces of sandstone). This arose from clayey/sandy depositions from great rivers on the Old Red Continent that were submerged in a deep sea, sinking to the sea floor in the Upper Devonian and the Lower Carboniferous. These deposits were later folded and, as part of the Variscan orogeny, once more lifted up. The tectonic forces along a southeast-northwest axis during this folding were what gave rise to the almost upright-standing slate areas, which were also thereby given the fissility that allowed them to be split into thin sheets that would be so important much later on to the local economy. The fossils in Breitenthal slate are either encrusted with a thin layer of pyrite or formed of fine crystals (<20 ¬µm).D. E. G. Briggs, Peter R. Crowther: Palaeobiology II: A Synthesis; Blackwell Publishing, 2001; , ; Seite 347 The municipal area's northwesternmost corner in the Rhaunen State Forest (Sangwald and Jungenwald) is part of a Taunus quartzite block, whose continuation can also be seen in the higher elevations to the west, namely the Sandkopf, the Wildenburger Kopf and the M√∂rschieder Burr (stratigraphy: Taunus quartzite; petrography: quartz sandstone and quartzitic sandstone with traces of claystone and siltstone). Geological risks arise from abandoned mines in the Schielenbach. Not only are their shafts in the ground formerly affording access to underground slatemines, but also the dangers inherent in old slate heaps at the mines. =Climate= View of Breitenthal in the wintertime Breitenthal lies in a zone characterized mainly by an oceanic climate with a prevailing wind direction from southwest to northwest. The topographically favourable location of the municipality's main centre in a hollow sloping gently towards the east confers a somewhat more favourable climate than that which prevails in nearby places. Very seldom is there hot and humid weather here. Because Breitenthal lies alee of the Wildenburg mountain ridge to the west and the Idar Forest to the north, showers and storms, as well as mean and absolute wind speed, are significantly less intense than would be expected given the synoptic structure. In the odd case when Breitenthal finds itself on the windward side of the Idar Forest, there can be prolonged rainfall and low cloud ceilings ahead of warm fronts as long as the wind is out of the south (between 150¬∞ and 210¬∞) and the dew point spread is only slight. The village is practically fog-free; only radiation fog is seen now and then, as well as the odd advection fog inflow from the Hosenbach valley within the framework of a local atmospheric circulation that forms with low-gradient anticyclonic weather systems. When there is a slight westerly wind, it can sometimes bring about an advection-induced hill fog on the saddle south of the village (in the training ground area) if moist air flowing from the Schielenbach condenses once it is lifted up. The village itself is not usually affected by this. Extreme weather in the form of summertime hot-weather thunderstorms arising in the Nahe valley can in times of overlying southeasterly upper air flows be swept over the Hosenbach valley to Breitenthal. These storms are made all the more intense by lifting processes with orographically induced increased strength, leading to unusually great amounts of precipitation within a short time. It was on the occasion of one such event that the lower-lying sections of the village's new development area experienced flooded basements, prompting improvements in surface-water removal systems through changes to the drainage ditches.

Once the French had auctioned off the lordly holdings to private owners as national property (bien national), Breitenthal could develop itself as a free village.Hugo Klar: Ortsnamen und Siedlungsgeschichte an der Oberen Nahe; in: Aufs√§tze zur Heimatkunde des Landkreises Birkenfeld, Band 2 Archaeological finds from the Bronze Age have led to the assumption that there was human settlement then within what are now the municipality's limits. In the cadastral area known as Hirtenb√∂sch and in the Hardtwald (forest), traces of settlement and gravesites from early Hallstatt times and La T√®ne times have been unearthed. Furthermore, in the area of the now vanished village of Battenhofen, clear signs of a Roman presence have been found in several spots right near the Roman road. The estate of Breitenthal (Breidendale) was mentioned in a 1282 document with which Konrad von Schmidtburg transferred the estate to his brother Gottfried von Kyrburg. In 1318, the Dinghof (lordly estate with lower jurisdiction) of Breidindeil was transferred by the Waldgrave Friedrich zu Kyrburg to Archbishop of Trier Baldwin, who at once enfeoffed the Waldgrave with his own former holding as an Electoral-Trier fief. Beginning in 1409, Breitenthal belonged to the Amt of Wildenburg with which it passed in 1515 to the Rhinegrave and Waldgrave of Kyrburg. After the Old Kyrburg line had died out, it passed to the Old Dhaun line of the Rhinegraves and Waldgraves. After this line split, a three-fourths share of the ownership went to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach, while each of the Salm-Salms and the Salm-Kyrburgs got a one-eighth share. The Waldgraviate and Rhinegraviate of Salm-Kyrburg ‚Äì as of 1743 the Principality of Salm-Kyrburg ‚Äì stood as an Imperially immediate territory from 1499 until the Treaty of Lun√©ville in 1801. The capital was Kirn. After the Principality of Salm-Kyrburg was conquered in 1794 and 1795 by French Revolutionary troops and annexed by France in 1798, the Holy Roman Empire ceded the country to France in the Treaty of Lun√©ville. The Princes lived mainly in Paris, where Prince Friedrich III of Salm-Kyburg was put to death by guillotine in the Reign of Terror in 1794. The Jammerseiche in soft rime In the Thirty Years' War, the region was occupied by Spanish troops after the Catholic League‚Äôs victory over the Protestant Union at the Battles of Wimpfen and H√∂chst in 1620, whereafter it bore a heavy burden as Spain‚Äôs unwilling host. No documents about Breitenthal from this time are known, but according to oral history, a number of people from both Breitenthal and Niederhosenbach who had tried to flee were surrounded by Spanish (Brabantish) soldiers in the area of the Jammerseiche (‚ÄúMoaning Oak‚Äù) on the boundary between these two municipalities and horribly killed.Beispielsweise: G. Bergen: An der Jammerseiche, in: Bl√§tter f√ºr Mosel, Hochwald und Hunsr√ºck, Ausgabe Oktober 1911 (2. Jahrgang, No. 1), Seite 6 After the Thirty Years' War came Lorrainian invasions and French king Louis XIV's War of the Reunions with the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession). In the face of the Lorrainian troops, the local lords (the Rhinegraves, the Duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and the Lords of Oberstein) joined forces in 1651 and, for their small population, fielded quite a large army of 1,700 infantrymen and 300 cavalrymen, who were stationed at the Wildenburg (castle) and in Herrstein, and who were under Rhinegrave Johann Ludwig's overall command. Already in December 1651, and again in 1652, there were two battles between Herrstein and the Wildenburg, which was destroyed as a result of the encounters. The Lorrainians were, however, defeated in both battles, and driven away. A focal point in the struggle was the ridge between the Fischbach and Oberw√∂rresbach, which is visible across the Schielenbach from Breitenthal. Only in 1713, though, with the Treaty of Utrecht, did the area get a chance to regenerate after 93 years of fighting. With its splintered territory, the Rhinegravial-Waldgravial domain was rather backward, even for its time. Until the French Revolutionary occupation in 1795, the people were unfree serfs who were subject to their lord's ill codified justice system. The Hunsr√ºck robber and outlaw Johannes B√ºckler, known as Schinderhannes, was suspected of having committed an offence in Breitenthal. During an interrogation that included 565 questions,Verh√∂r des Johannes B√ºckler, Schinderhannes genannt. Ver√∂ffentlicht bei genealog.de he was asked in Question 297 whether he ‚Äúalso [knew] nothing about the theft of beehives that happened to Philipp D√∂rr of Breitenthal, in the month of Vend√©miaire last in the garden abutting his house.‚Äù Schinderhannes denied any knowledge. Between 15 and 17 December 1795, there were clashes between French and Austrian troops on a line from Hennweiler through Wickenrodt to Asbach, and therefore in the Breitenthal area, too.Heinrich Baldes: Geschichtliche Heimatkunde der Birkenfelder Landschaft; 1923; Seite 292 The Austrians were overwhelmed and retreated. The neighbouring, Sponheim village, Niederhosenbach, was sternly punished by the French for supporting the Austrians. On 30 December 1795, a ceasefire went into effect, after which Breitenthal, along with the rest of the region, came into French hands. Under Napoleonic administration after the conquest of the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank in 1795, Breitenthal was a commune in the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Hottenbach in the canton of Herrstein in the arrondissement of Birkenfeld in the Department of Sarre, established in 1798 as part of the French First Republic, becoming in 1804 the First French Empire. This, at least, spelt the end of serfdom for the local inhabitants; the Rhinegraves and Waldgraves lost their privileges over the peasants, who could now fish and hunt more or less unhindered. Tithes were abolished, and equality before the law and the freedom to settle were enacted. The local inhabitants became free French citizens, with all attendant rights and obligations, after the Treaty of Lun√©ville of 9 February 1801. The Code civil was introduced. Disadvantageous, though, were the taxes, which were quite high, and the compulsory military service. The French era ended in January 1814 with the occupation by Bl√ºcher's Russian troops. The region first found itself under the Generalgouvernement Mittelrhein, a provisory body run by the Prussians, but by 16 June 1814, it had been put under the joint Imperial and Royal Austrian and Royal Bavarian Landesadministrationskommission. As of 2 June 1815, the area around Herrstein was awarded to Prussia, and administered as the Oberstein district, on the basis of the 25th article of the concluding act of the Congress of Vienna.Acte du Congr√®s de Vienne du 9 juin 1815, Art. 49: Territoires r√©serv√©s pour les maisons d'Oldenbourg, de Saxe-Cobourg, de Mecklenbourg-Strelitz, et le comte de Pappenheim In the course of the implementation of the Concert of Europe after the Congress of Vienna in 1815, though, Prussia had to indemnify several lesser rulers with pieces of territory on the Rhine's left bank under Article 49 of the concluding act of the Congress of Vienna. Thus, in 1817, Breitenthal, along with the whole Birkenfeld region from Kirnsulzbach in the east to Selbach (nowadays an outlying centre of Nohfelden in the Saarland) in the west, was ceded to the Oldenburg-ruled Principality of Birkenfeld (as of 1919, this became the Birkenfeld section of Oldenburg). During this time, the village belonged to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Herrstein. As a result of this rather arbitrary border (the criterion for forming a territorial unit was a population figure of 20,000), Breitenthal wound up a border town. While Oberhosenbach, Wickenrodt and Weiden were likewise Oldenburg territory, the neighbouring municipalities of Sulzbach and Hottenbach were Prussian territory. This border persisted as a district boundary between the Birkenfeld and Bernkastel districts even after German Unification and indeed as late as 1969, the time of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1883, there was an anthrax outbreak in Breitenthal that claimed three lives. The epidemic began with the consumption of an infected animal.Emil R. K√∂hler: Lebenserinnerungen; Seite 158 ff. Ver√∂ffentlicht als 26. Sonderheft zu den Mitteilungen des Vereins f√ºr Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld. News of the outbreak appeared in newspapers all over Germany. Seventeen men from Breitenthal either fell or went missing in the First World War, all in fighting on the Western Front in Flanders, Picardy, Champagne, on the Meuse around Verdun and in the Vosges. After the First World War, the region once again found itself under French administration. On 30 June 1930, the last French troops left the Rhineland, ending the occupation. Under ¬ß8(1) of the Greater Hamburg Act enacted by the Nazis during the Third Reich on 1 April 1937, the Birkenfeld section of Oldenburg was ceded to Prussia ‚Äì which was still a distinct entity within Germany even then ‚Äì becoming a district within the Rhine Province. Thus, on 26 October 1937, Breitenthal became Prussian. Eight men from Breitenthal fell and six went missing in the Second World War. There were other victims, too: five forced labourers from Ukraine, France and Belgium were used in Breitenthal during the war.Edgar Mais: Ende und Anfang 1945; Seite 401. Ver√∂ffentlicht 1985 als 48. Sonderheft zu den Mitteilungen des Vereins f√ºr Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld. Air raid victims, too, from Cologne and Koblenz, were temporarily housed in Breitenthal, particularly at the end of the war. There was little in the way of fighting in Breitenthal. In the winter of 1944-1945, a fighter-bomber attack on a Breitenthal farmer's horse-drawn vehicle killed a horse. In sporadic skirmishes with advancing US forces, two German soldiers were killed near the village. The Second World War ended in Breitenthal on the afternoon of 18 March 1945 when the village was surrendered without a fight to US troops of either the 41st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron or the 492nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion of Combat Command B of the 11th Armored Division ‚ÄúThunderbolt‚Äù. The latter had taken up a position near Oberhosenbach to lend the former some supporting fire, if needed. The fire was instead aimed at German infantry, columns of vehicles and anti-aircraft emplacements. Five German vehicles were destroyed, 15 prisoners were taken and one German soldier was killed.History of the 492nd Armored Field Artillery Battalion, Battalion After Action Reports, 18 March 1945 After the war, Breitenthal at first kept its rural, agricultural structure. With the growth of industrialization, though, farming came to be done only as a sideline; by the turn of the 21st century, there were only two full-time operations left. Although the village has expanded, the population figures have not changed much, despite the doubling of the number of residential buildings, including three designed for several families. =Population development= Listed here are population figures for selected years ‚Äì each time as at 31 December ‚Äì since the Congress of Vienna:Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz, unless otherwise noted { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  valign=\\"top\\"  * 1815 ‚Äì 169 * 1835 ‚Äì 223 * 1855 ‚Äì 225 * 1871 ‚Äì 210 * 1905 ‚Äì 227 * 1910 ‚Äì 225Gemeindeverzeichnis Deutschland 1910 * 1939 ‚Äì 220 * 1950 ‚Äì 212 * 1954 ‚Äì 233Verwaltungsbericht Kreisverwaltung Birkenfeld 1950‚Äì1955  valign=\\"top\\"  * 1961 ‚Äì 246 * 1962 ‚Äì 258 * 1963 ‚Äì 259 * 1964 ‚Äì 263 * 1965 ‚Äì 261 * 1966 ‚Äì 254 * 1967 ‚Äì 260 * 1968 ‚Äì 256 * 1969 ‚Äì 256  valign=\\"top\\"  * 1970 ‚Äì 259 * 1971 ‚Äì 252 * 1972 ‚Äì 251 * 1973 ‚Äì 248 * 1974 ‚Äì 253 * 1975 ‚Äì 253 * 1976 ‚Äì 263 * 1977 ‚Äì 266 * 1978 ‚Äì 272 * 1979 ‚Äì 288  valign=\\"top\\"  * 1980 ‚Äì 282 * 1981 ‚Äì 289 * 1982 ‚Äì 284 * 1983 ‚Äì 285 * 1984 ‚Äì 299 * 1985 ‚Äì 294 * 1986 ‚Äì 297 * 1987 ‚Äì 303 * 1988 ‚Äì 309 * 1989 ‚Äì 316  valign=\\"top\\"  * 1990 ‚Äì 310 * 1991 ‚Äì 321 * 1992 ‚Äì 326 * 1993 ‚Äì 321 * 1994 ‚Äì 313 * 1995 ‚Äì 331 * 1996 ‚Äì 335 * 1997 ‚Äì 340 * 1998 ‚Äì 335 * 1999 ‚Äì 327  valign=\\"top\\"  * 2000 ‚Äì 333 * 2001 ‚Äì 330 * 2002 ‚Äì 320 * 2003 ‚Äì 324 * 2004 ‚Äì 329 * 2005 ‚Äì 333 * 2006 ‚Äì 326 * 2007 ‚Äì 327 * 2008 ‚Äì 337 * 2009 ‚Äì 321  valign=\\"top\\"  * 2010 ‚Äì 325 * 2011 ‚Äì 322 * 2012 ‚Äì 322 * 2013 ‚Äì 304 * 2014 ‚Äì 311 * 2015 ‚Äì 310 * 2016 ‚Äì 312 * 2017 ‚Äì 313 } Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Der Landeswahlleiter Rheinland-Pfalz: Kommunalwahl 2014, Stadt- und Gemeinderatswahlen =Mayor= Breitenthal's mayor is Wolfgang Diel. =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In schr√§ggestelltem Schild vorne in Blau zwei silberne Spitzen mit breitem Zwischenraum, hinten ein blaubewehrter und -gezungter roter L√∂we in Gold. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend azure a base argent issuant from which two piles transposed of the same, the dexter standing no higher than the fess point and the sinister no higher than the nombril point, and Or a lion rampant gules armed and langued of the first. The charges on the escutcheon's dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side are canting for the municipality's name, Breitenthal, which comes from the German words breiten Tal (with the archaic spelling of the latter word, with an H). The base form of this expression, without an article, would be breites Tal in the nominative case since the noun Tal takes the neuter gender. The phrase is therefore presumably in the dative case, in which an adjective takes the ‚Äîen ending in the neuter when there is an article. The grammatical niceties aside, the words together mean ‚Äúbroad dale‚Äù (and are even cognate with their English counterparts). The two ‚Äúpiles transposed‚Äù (upward- pointing wedgelike charges) with a flat line between them are meant to illustrate a broad dale between two hills, and thereby recall the municipality's name. The lion on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Rhinegraves and Waldgraves. The arms have been borne since 18 May 1962.Description and explanation of Breitenthal‚Äôs arms =Town partnerships= Breitenthal fosters unofficial but close contacts with the following places: * Breitenthal in Schwaben, G√ºnzburg district, Bavaria Culture and sightseeing =Customs= Characteristic for the region and the village are names for older buildings and members of long-established families. A custom is the Meie in which the village women meet once each month to exchange village news over drinks and snacks. The meeting place each time is a different participant's house. =Local speech= The Breitenthal dialect is a variant of what is otherwise known as the Mosell√§ndisch dialect, also known as Hunsr√ºckisch. In this dialect, the municipality's name becomes Br√§nel. In a map entry by French geographers in 1737,Les Cartes des Naudin: Carte tr√®s particuli√®re du pays compris entre les villes de Sierques, Remich, Treves, Bern Castel, Traerbach the village is named as Breneldal. =Natural monuments= On a hill south of the village stands a grove of trees known as the Jammerseiche (‚ÄúMoaning Oak‚Äù), said in the local oral history to have been the scene of ghastly incidents during the Thirty Years' War. The coppice that once stood next to the grove was felled quite recently, leaving the grove standing alone as a prominent landmark. =Clubs= Typical of villages in the Hunsr√ºck is a well developed club life. DSG Breitenthal ‚Äò95 e.V. was the first of Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs now three independent women‚Äôs football clubs. DSG Breitenthal‚Äôs Team 1 plays in the Verbandsliga S√ºdwest and its Team 1b plays in the Bezirksliga Nahe. The gymnastic and sport club TuS Breitenthal / Oberhosenbach is a sport club with a broad offering of activities. The football department‚Äôs first team currently plays in the Kreisliga West I. The Singgemeinschaft Breitenthal is a mixed choir integrated into the Nahe- Hunsr√ºck-Chor (choir). The choir is a successor to the M√§nnergesangverein Breitenthal, a men‚Äôs choir established in 1892. This became a mixed choir after 1919. When the Second World War ended, so did singing in Breitenthal choirs, at least for a few years. The first new choir to arise in the village was a women‚Äôs choir that sang mainly at burials. Only in late 1955 did the new choir, now known as the Singgemeinschaft (‚ÄúSinging Association‚Äù), come into being. The F√∂rderverein der Freiwilligen Feuerwehr Breitenthal (‚ÄúBreitenthal Fire Brigade Promotional Association‚Äù) set itself up after restructuring of the firefighting establishment within the Verbandsgemeinde of Herrstein. In 2000, a new concept in firefighting came into force, one that took into account the demographic development and changes to commercial structures in the municipalities. The local fire brigades were gathered together in ‚Äúlaunching‚Äù areas in such a way that each local brigade remained a standalone brigade. This was meant to ensure, especially during the daytime, that enough firefighting personnel were available to keep to the 8-minute response time set forth by law. The Promotional Association supports the Breitenthal local fire brigade with both personnel and materiel. The Schalke-Fanclub Br√§neler Knappen was founded on 1 March 2008 and offers local fans of FC Schalke 04 a home base. =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Oldenburger Stra√üe 6 ‚Äì estate complex; house marked 1856, exterior renovation in early 20th century * Oldenburger Stra√üe 10 ‚Äì scattered estate; house, partly timber-frame, marked 1832, essentially possibly older, timber-frame barn Streetscape Breitenthal is, if the new building developments are not counted, like many of the region‚Äôs municipalities in that it has a more or less irregular assemblage of (formerly) agricultural buildings along the main street (in this case, Oldenburger Stra√üe) without an identifiable village centre. Predominating among these houses ‚Äì even among the newer ones that were built in the 1950s in rustic style ‚Äì is the typical Hunsr√ºck Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street) with the eaves facing the street. The noteworthy ‚Äì and also interesting from a cultural history perspective ‚Äì more lavish buildings in the village are built as scattered homesteads, expressing something of the size of the owner‚Äôs estate and his social standing. The new building developments are structured and laid out in contemporary fashion. In Breitenthal, little in the way of old building is still preserved. Of cultural-historical importance is the property at Oldenburger Stra√üe 9, which has a freestanding house surrounded by a hook-shaped commercial wing marked ‚Äú1856‚Äù; as such it is one of the most northerly examples of this building form, which is also rare in this region. Particularly noteworthy are the weightbearing sandstone columns on the commercial wing where it faces the street. The village's oldest building is a scattered estate at Oldenburger Stra√üe 10 (see above), marked ‚Äú1832‚Äù above the door, which is, however, essentially from the 17th century. The succession of owners is known back to 1660. The Classicist front door with a leaded window, curved panes and old locks, was removed during renovation work in the 1990s. The old schoolhouse from 1840, on whose upper floor the classrooms were found, is in a very bad state and currently stands empty. New building developments were opened up on the village's northern outskirts in the 1950s and on its northwestern outskirts in the 1970s. As planned, the newer development was expanded a few years ago with the addition of the building plots west of Waldstra√üe and along the street ‚ÄúIm Forstgarten‚Äù. Very recently, there has been a greater amount of work aiming to fill in gaps in the streetscape in the old village to avoid ‚Äúurban decay‚Äù in the municipality's original centre. Unlike many places in the region, Breitenthal has very few buildings that stand empty or are unfit for use. =Regular events= The local clubs hold a joint Carnival ‚Äì locally Fastnacht ‚Äì ball with presentations and lively contributions. Over the years, certain groups have managed to come out as the ball programme's headers. The gymnastic and sport club does the staging while the volunteer fire brigade does the men's ballet. Then there are the ‚Äúwell informed witches‚Äù. The Sportfest staged by the Breitenthal/Oberhosenbach gymnastic and sport club is held over four days each year in late May and early June. As one of the region's first great village festivals each year. Saturday evening, with its popular music bands filling the programme, is an especially strong draw. At irregular intervals, the Leckschmier-Kirb (‚ÄúLekvar Fair‚Äù) is held, at which great kettles of homemade Leckschmier, as it is locally known (Latwerge in standard High German), are cooked over open fires and marketed along with homemade sourdough bread. The Quetsche-Kirb was an event staged by the Braun Inn (Gasthaus Braun), at which freshly baked zwetschge (a plum variety) cakes could be eaten in great numbers, mostly with Kirner beer, or singly with coffee. The Singing Association's theatre group produces a folk play at irregular intervals, usually at Easter, whose contents and language are often adapted to traditional Breitenthal norms. This is presented at the hall with a stage at the Braun Inn. Economy and infrastructure Until the late 19th century, crudely worked slate quarrystones were used as a building material. Given the low level of processing that this stone required, it was mined in pits on the surface rather than underground, despite the problematic geological structure of Hunsr√ºck slate. In 1824, when the Oldenburg government issued a ban on thatches, there was suddenly a great demand for a roofing material that did not burn. The thin sheets of slate used for this could only be mined underground because of the difficulty of processing the stone. Until the early 1960s, high-quality slate was still being mined and processed in the Schielenbach to the village's southwest. The mining rights were leased mostly to Breitenthal citizens by the municipality. Many Breitenthalers earned extra income ‚Äì often as a secondary job ‚Äì doing this, even though by today's standards the working conditions were very unfavourable. Local geological peculiarities meant that the slate could only be mined underground, not quarried at the surface: since the slate in the Breitenthal area stood steeply upright, and because only a small part of it was technically exploitable, mining had to proceed right into the mountain. (Around the Schielenbach, many old boreholes can still be found; they all belong to the same mining complex.) Any meaningful processing of the material thus mined could then only be done as long as it was moist from groundwater. This in turn meant that the processing had to be done on site, and this is still witnessed today by the great waste heaps in the Schielenbach former mining area. Today, the municipality's main economic function is as a residential community housing commuters =Transport= Breitenthal is crossed by Landesstra√üe (State Road) 180, which is met by Kreisstra√üe (District Road) 23 from Wickenrodt and Kreisstra√üe 26 from Niederhosenbach within the municipality. The southern stretch of the planned Hunsr√ºckspange (‚ÄúHunsr√ºck link‚Äù) is to come from the Fischbach valley and through the Schielenbach by way of the Breitenthal municipal area, thereby negotiating a change in elevation of 120 m over a distance of one kilometre. To keep the gradient to no more than 8%, extensive alignment measures will need to be undertaken. The municipality's residential and transport areas, at 11.2% of Breitenthal's municipal area, currently exceed the average for Rhineland-Palatinate Ortsgemeinden in the same size class (9.0%) by 27%.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz. Ortsdatenbank ‚ÄûMeine Heimat‚Äú / ‚ÄûMein Dorf, meine Stadt‚Äú The project's implementation will further worsen this situation, which is why this highway's planned alignment is the subject of much controversy. Bus route 346 (Idar-Oberstein - Herrstein - Wickenrodt) run by Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe (ORN) links the municipality with the middle centre of Idar-Oberstein. Special buses are used to ferry children to and from school or kindergarten in Niederw√∂rresbach. The nearest railway stations are at Idar-Oberstein and Kirn, from which run hourly trains to Mainz/Frankfurt or Saarbr√ºcken on the Nahe Valley Railway. Frankfurt-Hahn Airport lies 19 km to Breitenthal's north and can be reached in 20 minutes. Local, regional and long-distance cycle and hiking paths, such as the Sirona- Weg and the Saar-Hunsr√ºck-Steig (Traumschleife Mittelalterpfad) lead either through or right by the village. =Established businesses= Breitenthal has two full-time agricultural operations. One specializes in hog raising and fattening. Six other businesses are located in Breitenthal. =Service sector= Some of the tertiary sector of the economy is based on wheels. Baker's and butcher's services are mobile, and drive into Breitenthal regularly. Even the district savings bank sends a weekly mobile bank branch to the village. In the way of health services, there are two general practitioners and one dentist in neighbouring Herrstein. The nearest hospital is in Idar-Oberstein. Breitenthal's Internet access comes by way of a DSL service provider. =Public institutions= The village school building, dedicated on 19 October 1957, was converted into a community centre after the Herrstein Regional School opened. Besides a guestroom, the building also has a further small lodging room in the basement (the Jugoslawen-Raum, so called after a group of Yugoslav lumberjacks were housed there for a while), which is mainly used as a youth centre and a meeting room for TuS Breitenthal (gymnastic and sport club), and shower and changing rooms. In the attic are both a gymnastic and exercise room and a church room, where the Wickenrodt Evangelical parish holds its services. The municipal graveyard with its mortuary, built in 1966, lies on the village's southeastern outskirts on Kreisstra√üe 26 on the way to Niederhosenbach. TuS Breitenthal/Oberhosenbach has at its disposal a grass-covered sporting ground on the way out of the village towards Oberhosenbach (and actually within Oberhosenbach's limits). Nearby are a small playground and a football pitch. South of the village, on the way to the Jammerseiche, on a meadow, lies a floodlit drill ground, which serves the gymnastic and sport club's football teams as a training ground. DSG Breitenthal ‚Äô95 has no sporting ground at its disposal in Breitenthal. They play and train at TuS Tiefenstein‚Äôs sport facilities in Idar-Oberstein.

Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the Traunbach in the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest) in the Hunsr√ºck. The municipal area is 62.3% wooded. Within Br√ºcken's limits, on the Friedrichskopf, rises the Allbach, whose upper reaches bear the name K√∂nigsbach. Six kilometres to the west of Br√ºcken lies the Saarland. Together with the outlying centre of Traunen, which was merged with the municipality in 1934, the population is almost 1,300. =Constituent communities= The municipality's Ortsteile are Br√ºcken (main centre) and Traunen. Also belonging to Br√ºcken is the outlying homestead of Friesenhof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 19 (PDF) =Climate= Yearly precipitation in Br√ºcken amounts to 1 021 mm, which is very high, falling into the highest fourth of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 86% of the German Weather Service's weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is July. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is 1.8 times what it is in July. Precipitation varies greatly. Only at 18% of the weather stations are higher seasonal swings recorded. History Dating from as early as the late Bronze Age in the 1st millennium BC, the so-called New Hallstatt times, are some potsherds and parts of metal torcs found near what is now Br√ºcken, which suggests that there was a settlement along the Middle Traunbach at the time. Whether it was a permanent one cannot be determined. This settlement might have been built on the important trade road that crossed the Traunbach near Br√ºcken. Such crossings ‚Äì bridges or fords ‚Äì are well known to have been favourite locations for settlements. Br√ºcken grew out of a fishing village that was established right on the Traunbach. Inglinheim, as it was called, was named about 1200 in a directory of holdings from the church in Trier when four fishermen, who fished on the Traunbach for the Bishop of Trier, settled there. Almost as long ago was Traunen's first documentary mention in a document from the V√∂gte of Hunolstein in 1256. Traunen always belonged to the Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) of Achtelsbach and was until its amalgamation with Br√ºcken in 1934 a self-administering municipality. Besides Traunen, there have been other homesteads and lesser centres that stood in what is now Br√ºcken, among others the homestead of Ruppenthal, which lay at the forks of the Laienflo√ü and G√∂tzenbach, the homestead of Hinzhausen at the foot of the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest) and Uffhofen, whose location is now uncertain. Hinzhausen is the subject of a local legend (see below). Br√ºcken itself had its first documentary mention in a document from a neighbouring municipality in 1324. One of the villagers, named Henrich bei der Brucke, was named as a witness and a bondsman, but the document does not go into further details. The village of Br√ºcken could not have been very big, for a 1437 compilation for the County of Sponheim listed only two people there who were subject to taxation. Even years later, in 1465, a taxation register still only listed two people who had to pay interest. Thereafter, however, the population rose steadily, reaching eight households by 1500 and swallowing up the homesteads mentioned above. The village's importance and size kept growing through the decades that followed, leading the villagers to put forth as early as 1584 their first Dorfordnung (‚Äúvillage order‚Äù), which was reviewed and expanded in 1612. This democratically governed the villagers‚Äô coexistence, with the express approval of the authorities. The population growth can only be understood against the backdrop of the favourable economic conditions. Besides agriculture and small craft businesses, several mills contributed to the upswing. The Thirty Years' War took a heavy toll on Br√ºcken, as it did elsewhere in Germany, reducing the population, bringing the economy to a halt and tearing great gaps in all aspects of life. Only a third of the villagers survived; some neighbouring villages were depopulated completely. The 18th and 19th centuries once more brought a certain level of economic health to the villages, although economic wealth did not come overnight. Reasons for this could be seen in improvements to agriculture and forestry, the distribution of former lordly and communally held lands to the peasants and also in an emerging handicraft industry. In 1861, for the first time, an industrial operation located in Br√ºcken. Wood charcoal, tar, wood vinegar and other chemicals were manufactured. Serving as raw material were the surrounding forests. While some found work at the plant, local farmers also found extra earning opportunities in transporting goods or hewing wood. Br√ºcken grew into one of the biggest villages in the Birkenfelder Land. Having a great number of children, as many local families did in the 18th and 19th centuries, was not always a blessing, bringing along with it economic and, not least of all, social problems. Not everyone could find a job in the village, and so some had to move away. Germany's new industrialization needed a workforce, while settlers were what was wanted in North and South America and Eastern Europe. Many of the inhabitants had no choice but to seek their fortunes in faraway lands. The First and Second World Wars ravaged families with their heavy toll. Almost every family lost somebody. Those who survived were marked for life. The most recent decades have brought considerable economic and technical advancement in all areas of life. Nonetheless, things of value have been lost. Today, Br√ºcken, once characterized by agriculture, is a residential community most of whose inhabitants commute to jobs elsewhere, for there are not enough jobs in the municipality itself.Br√ºcken‚Äôs history Br√ºcken is known for the legend of Hinzhausen. According to this, there was a village in the forest that was stricken with the Plague. After long pondering what should be done, the surviving villagers decided to barricade their village from the inside and burn everything to the ground, thereby sparing all villages around them the horror that they had faced. It is said that the destroyed village's ruins can still be seen in the middle of the forest near Br√ºcken. These ruins actually do exist, although it is unknown whether they are actually what is left of the tragic, Plague-stricken village of Hinzhausen. =Village‚Äôs name= The name ‚ÄúBr√ºcken‚Äù refers to the bridges ‚Äì Br√ºcken literally means ‚Äúbridges‚Äù in German ‚Äì that have to be crossed to reach the village centre.Village‚Äôs name Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Standing there from about 170 to 50 BC was a Late Iron Age, Late Celtic fortification complex, or castellum, of the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. This hill castle was first laid out as a lightly fortified settlement on the heights and only later given strong walls. The last traces of human presence there vanished in the mid 1st century BC. It is said to be the most thoroughly explored complex of its kind.Alfred Haffner: Die Altburg von Bundenbach im s√ºdlichen Hunsr√ºck. In: Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier: Trier. Augustusstadt der Treverer. Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1984, . As a result of the exploratory digs, the Altburg has been partly restored to its form in the 1st century BC, and has been expanded into a unique, protohistoric open-air museum. The Freilichtmuseum Altburg was dedicated and opened to the public in 1988. Bundenbach's founding may be placed in the earlier half of the 10th century. It had its first documentary mention, though, in a Waldgravial partition document on 14 March 1283. The Waldgraves had the forest cleared and thereby gained freehold land for themselves. This was named Beunde. The settlement on the Beunde, which also lay on a brook (Bach in German), thereby got its name: Bundenbach. Mentioned much nearer the presumed founding date, however, was the Schmidtburg, the Waldgraves‚Äô ancestral seat in the Hahnenbach valley. This first cropped up in history in 1084. Bundenbach was always bound to the Schmidtburg, even after the childless Waldgrave Heinrich von der Schmidtburg enfeoffed Archbishop and Elector of Trier Baldwin in 1324 with the Schmidtburg and the villages belonging to it. From 1330 to 1794, Bundenbach belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Schmidtburg. The Schmidtburg, which actually lies within Schneppenbach‚Äôs limits, was thoroughly repaired between 1981 and 1987. It is among the Hunsr√ºck‚Äôs oldest castles. Politically, after the Amt of Schmidtburg was dissolved and after its short time in the French canton of Rhaunen in Napoleonic times, from 1817 to 1937 Bundenbach was part of the Grand Duchy and Free State of Oldenburg, and more locally to the Principality (later Province) of Birkenfeld. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland- Palatinate, Bundenbach passed from the Amt of Herrstein to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen in the Birkenfeld district (and also in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz, although Rhineland-Palatinate abolished Regierungsbezirke in 1999) in 1970. Bundenbach is known internationally for its slate mining and important fossil finds. The use of slate in the Bundenbach area has a demonstrably long history: the Celtic hill castle‚Äôs defensive wall was built of slate quarrystones. The first slate mining lease agreement is witnessed on Saint Walpurga‚Äôs Day 1519: The Lords of Wiltberg leased their ‚ÄúLaienkaul unden an Prorschitt uff der Bach gelegen‚Äù (‚ÄúLaienkaul down below at Bruschied, lying on the brook‚Äù) for four years to, among others, the two Bundenbach residents Peter and Niklas Huppen. In 1865 21 slate mines still existed within Bundenbach's limits. In 2000, open-cast slate mining came to an end at Bundenbach's last slate pit. Since then, only slates delivered from elsewhere have been worked. Another mine, the Herrenberg slate pit near the Altburg and opposite the Schmidtburg, first mentioned in 1822, ceased operations in 1964. Eleven years later, a private initiative by Bundenbach residents was begun to open this mine as a tourist attraction. It was dedicated and opened to the public in 1976. It was later expanded with the addition of a fossil museum that displays noteworthy pieces along with old photographs and equipment.Bundenbach‚Äôs history Bundenbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

According to one report, hewn stones were brought to light while ploughing was being done in Dickesbach about 1900. These were reckoned to have been used as channelling. At the site of this find, the Scheed (or Scheide), lying between Weierbach (nowadays an outlying centre of Idar-Oberstein) and what is now Dickesbach, it is believed that a settlement of some kind once stood, and that today's Dickesbach arose only after this old settlement had vanished. In 1367, Dickesbach had its first documentary mention in a document that contained a list of contributions that the villages of Berschweiler, Dickesbach, Mittelreidenbach, M√∂rschied, Niederhosenbach, Niederw√∂rresbach and Oberreidenbach in the Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) of Niederw√∂rresbach had to make to the Vogtei ‚Äì in chickens. Dickesbach was in the County of Zweibr√ºcken in those days. There are, however, doubts as to whether this was truly the village's first documentary mention. Among others contributing to these doubts was the Gutsvorsteher (head of a Gutsbezirk, or ‚Äúestate area‚Äù) Alfons Hartmann, who wrote in his book Erg√§nzung der Chronik des Gutsbezirk Baumholder mit den Chroniken der ehemaligen Einzelgeh√∂fte und M√ºhlen (roughly ‚ÄúSupplement to the Estate Area‚Äôs Chronicle With Those From the Former Smallholds and Mills‚Äù) ‚Äì on page 31 ‚Äì that Dickesbach had already been named as a municipality belonging to the parish of Kirchenbollenbach as early as the 13th century. It could even be that Dickesbach's first documentary mention came about 200 years earlier than the mention in the chicken tax document, a copy of which is on hand in the municipality of Dickesbach. In 1526, the parish of Kirchenbollenbach, in which Dickesbach lay, belonged to Duke Ludwig II of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken (reigned 1514‚Äì1532), and he yielded that same year to the parish's and the municipalities‚Äô wish to make the parish of Kirchenbollenbach Evangelical. In 1557, Duke Wolfgang, Ludwig II's son, decreed a church system for his country, based on the 1555 Peace of Augsburg, which saw the parish of Kirchenbollenbach become Lutheran. In 1595, the parish of Kirchenbollenbach came under the lordship of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg, who, after the Peace of Augsburg, had openly joined the Protestant camp. By 1681, French King Louis XIV had annexed the Amt of Kyrburg and occupied Kirn by reason of a ruling by his Chambre des R√©unions. The French supported their fellow Catholics in whatever way they could, which eventually led to a Royal order on 21 December 1684, whereby any centre that had two churches had to relinquish the smaller one to the Catholics. However, any centre that had only one church had to share it between the two denominations. The patchwork of microstates that characterized what is now Germany up until the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was particularly fragmenting in the Dickesbach area and resulted in an absurd tangle of boundaries. This sometimes led to rather ridiculous disputes, a case in point being the dispute over the Idarbann, quite a small piece of territory, that erupted in 1766 when the Lord of Oberstein, Count Christian Karl Reinhard, died. The Amtmann of Birkenfeld, named Fabert, occupied the bridge over the Idarbach with some 400 armed peasants and militiamen. The Saarbr√ºcken Kammerrat advanced with 80 soldiers and the Commissioner of Trier with 90. The whole business was occasioned by Forester G√∂rlitz's sticking letters patent of seizure by the Lordship of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken on Peter Georg Juchem's house in Idar. In response, Fabert and the court Sch√∂ffe (roughly ‚Äúlay jurist‚Äù) Trein hurried there to tear the letters patent off Juchem's house and there hang the Sponheim coat of arms instead. In early November 1803, Schinderhannes and his band of brigands were put to death in Mainz. One of these was a man from Dickesbach, a field ranger named Philipp Klein, nicknamed Husarenphilipp (‚ÄúHussar Philipp‚Äù). The great trial against Johannes B√ºckler (Schinderhannes) and his confederates in robbery had ended that month in death sentences, by guillotine, for this was Napoleonic times and the region was under French rule, for 19 of the band's robbers besides B√ºckler himself. After the sentences were read out, the court reporter in Mainz wrote the following: ‚ÄúWhen the accused were given refreshments, at which time B√ºckler behaved extremely calmly, the so-called Husarenphilipp took his breakfast with a coldness, as though nothing concerned him.‚Äù This seemingly hard-bitten man, Phillip Klein, was born in Wickenrodt and was employed in Dickesbach as a field ranger. He became involved with Johannes B√ºckler (Schinderhannes), and even worked to wive him. Julie Bl√§sius (known by the nickname ‚ÄúJulchen‚Äù) told the trial judge this story: ‚ÄúA man from Dickesbach, whose name I do not know, came to my birthplace. He met me with my sister Margarethe at the Jakob Fritsch inn. He told me and my sister Margarethe to come with him into the forest, called Dollbach (Dollberg), which lies only a quarter hour from our village, as there would be somebody there who wanted to talk to us, but without telling us his name or the object of his invitation. Although I did not want to betake myself there on this vain suggestion, the man from Dickesbach managed to talk me into going with him. My sister Margarethe went with us. When I came into the forest, I met a handsome young person there, who suggested to me that I leave my parents and follow him. Since I did not want to accept his suggestion, the many lovely promises that he was incessantly making to me notwithstanding, he threatened to kill me and in this way, I was persuaded by violence to follow this stranger. Only much later, when I was also already too far from my parents, did I learn that the man who kidnapped me was the so-called Schinderhannes.‚Äù In 1815, at the time of the Congress of Vienna, the village had 151 inhabitants. In 1838, the local land register was set up. The village itself had 36 houses. In 1839, there were 42 building owners. The first schoolhouse was built in 1840. In 1847, the Evangelical school at Dickesbach received from King Frederick William IV of Prussia a gift of a Bible, which is now owned by the Ortsgemeinde. The graveyard was laid out in 1850. Formerly, the dead had been buried in nearby villages according to denomination: Evangelicals in Kirchenbollenbach (now part of Idar-Oberstein) and Catholics in Mittelreidenbach, since burials could only take place on consecrated ground. Outside the graveyard as it is now, behind the sandstone cross, was the Catholic section, and before the cross was the Evangelical section. Later, on the former, now removed, Catholic section, a weeping willow was planted, which can still be seen today. In 1856, a typhus epidemic claimed 27 lives. On 15 July 1858, the Bingerbr√ºck-Kreuznach railway line came into service, with the extension from Kreuznach to Oberstein following on 15 December 1859. Also that year, several houses in Dickesbach were burnt down in a great fire. On 25 May 1860, the whole railway from the Rhine to the Saar was dedicated. In 1871, at the time of victory in the Franco-Prussian War, Dickesbach had 209 inhabitants. In 1892, Hahne Wilhelm opened the village's first village shop, but the following year, it burnt down. In 1895, the village hall on Oberdorfstra√üe was built. On 15 December 1896, church arrangements in the parish were settled. The simultaneum at the church in Kirchenbollenbach came to an end with a 13,000-mark payment that transferred ownership to the Protestants alone. In 1898, Wilhelm Hahn opened the village's first inn. By the end of the 19th century, electricity was making its presence felt throughout the Nahe region. In 1903, however, the reeve (Ortsvorsteher) refused a proposal to build waterworks. In 1907, the first telephone line reached Dickesbach, with the first telephone being installed at Julius Jakobi's house. That same year, a compulsory fire brigade was established (as of 1953, this became a volunteer fire brigade). In politics, the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Sien was dissolved on 1 December and Dickesbach was grouped with Weierbach. In 1910, at Whitsun, the road to Weierbach was opened. It had cost 34,500 marks to build. Until this opening, traffic had had to take a rough road that led along the foot of the Dollberg. In 1915, a road to Zaubach (nowadays an outlying centre of Birkenfeld) was built as well. Also in 1914 came the outbreak of hostilities in the First World War. On the morning of 16 January 1918, between Hochstetten and Martinstein, shortly before the fork in the road leading into the Kellenbach valley, furlough train 843 from Saarbr√ºcken, bound for Mainz, fully occupied by German soldiers, derailed. Thirty-four dead were recovered from the river Nahe, and of a further nine, no trace could be found. The cause was determined to have been track that had been undermined by heavy rainfall. In all, the First World War claimed 13 Dickesbach men's lives, with some known to have been killed in action, and others to have gone missing in action. In 1920, the Restkreis of St. Wendel was formed with its seat at Baumholder. A Restkreis was a ‚Äúleftover district‚Äù, so called when the French-ruled Saarland was established and its border cut through long-established districts. The part left within the zone of German sovereignty was then reconstituted as a Restkreis. Dickesbach was grouped into the Restkreis of St. Wendel. On 29 December 1922, electric light burnt for the first time in Dickesbach, and candlelight, at least as an everyday means of lighting, was consigned to history. In 1923 came the hyperinflation for which the Weimar Republic was so notorious. It had ended by November that same year, but not before a US dollar could be bought for nothing less than 1,000,000,000,000 marks. In 1927, Dickesbach had 268 inhabitants, 224 Evangelical and 44 Catholic. The municipal area measured 418 ha, of which 160 ha was wooded; the municipality owned 149 ha of these woodlands. In Niederhausen, the electrical substation came into service in 1927, linking the whole Nahe region to the RWE grid and the great coal-fired power stations. Gas lanterns and kerosene lamps were thus also consigned to history. It was not until 17 April 1929 that work finished on the new waterworks, 26 years after the reeve had refused the original proposal. Until this time, water had had to be drawn from wells. On 13 August 1938, in the time of the Third Reich, the first building firms came. On the heights, 11 Siegfried Line bunkers were built. On both sides of Oberdorfstra√üe, buildings went up: two buildings to lodge non-commissioned officers, and a Flakhalle ‚Äì literally ‚Äúanti-aircraft hall‚Äù ‚Äì with personnel rooms. As part of these measures, a new drainage ditch reinforced with quarrystones was built along the road, and the road itself was also fortified. Dickesbach thus became a community on the edge of the newly laid out Baumholder troop drilling ground. In 1939, the municipality had 256 inhabitants. An army field hospital was set up at the nearby Niederreidenbacher Hof in 1939. In 1940, Wehrmacht personnel were quartered at the Schwenk inn. That same year, an incendiary bomb attack on the Colony Building at the Niederreidenbacher Hof claimed 63 lives. On 8 May 1945, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel signed the surrender document at Karlshorst, ending the war in Europe. In all, the Second World War claimed 25 Dickesbach men's lives, with some known to have been killed in action, and others to have gone missing in action. By war's end, the number of houses in the village was 53 and by 1950 the village's population was 321. That same year, the first new building development zone (Schulstra√üe) was opened. In 1953, the volunteer fire brigade was established, and two years later, the brigade's equipment house was built. In 1956, the municipality acquired from a citizen, Anna Hahn, a building lot to make more room for building a new school building. It cost 1,300 marks. Also that year, during Flurbereinigung, the municipality made available some municipal land for widening the road to Zaubach. Some cropland in outlying areas that was no longer cultivated was allowed to revert to woodland. In June 1956, a survey was done in preparation for the establishment of outlying farmsteads (Aussiedlerh√∂fe). The municipality gave the farmstead group 23 ha of land at a price of 1,000 marks for each hectare to set up the Sonnh√∂fe (actually one homestead, even though the name is grammatically plural). Some woods had to be cleared to make way for cropfields. On 22 December 1956, municipal council decided to build a new schoolhouse in line with planning by the Birkenfeld Building Office because the older building, and the teacher's house, too, had fallen into such disrepair. In 1958, the monument to the fallen and missing in both world wars was festively dedicated on Whitsunday. Also in 1958, the first tractor bought by a local farmer appeared in the municipality. It was owned by Heinrich Jakobi.Dickesbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Dickesbach's mayor is Heinz Matzen, and his deputies are Steven Arnold and Detlef Petry.Dickesbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per bend gules three lozenges conjoined in bend argent, each charged with a roundle sable, and Or a lion rampant of the first armed and langued azure.

It is on the eastern side of the Ciurea train station and is inhabited by Roma from the Churari and Kalderash castes (on the western side there is the main village, inhabited by Romanians and Romanian-speaking Roma).  History  Before World War II, Zanea was a Romanian village populated by peaceful peasants. They were working in their small farms as well as in a private estate (Mo»ôie), owned by a Jewish family. Due to antisemitic laws, the estate was confiscated. At the end of the war, it was returned to the original owners, who proceeded to renovate and repair the place. As Romania was taken over by a Soviet-backed communist administration, the estate was again confiscated in 1948 by the authorities. The estate was established as \\"commune property\\" and broke down. In the early 1950s, 5 Roma families (gypsies) settled in the village. The neighborhood appeared in the decades 1950s‚Äì1960s as a result of the forced settlement of Roma nomads by the communist authorities (similar Kalderash and/or Churari communities in the geographical proximity are in Grajduri and in the northern side of Vaslui). These communities were already hard hit by the Porajmos (the Holocaust of the Romani people); in 1942‚Äì1944 they were deported in Transnistria, where many of them died. Additionally to the forced settlement, the savings (in gold, as is traditionally among Roma) were confiscated by the authorities. Combined with the fact that the Communist system forbade any private business (all the economy was nationalized), thus being impeded to profess the crafts that supported their livelihood, these Roma became poorer during those decades. After the 1989 Revolution that brought democracy in Romania, it became again legal to profess the crafts. The confiscated gold was partly returned and with that capital in the 1990s businesses were started, mostly with metals. During those years, they began to build roomy houses (with more floors, for the traditional extended Romani families), having a very different architecture from that usually employed in Romania, soon dubbed by the local mass-media as palate »õigƒÉne»ôti (\\"Gypsy palaces\\" in Romanian). Their different style is usually presented by this media and most of the non-Romani population as expressing lack of culture, while (lacking yet a public Romani point of view about this issue) some architects point out to their spontaneity and freedom of style. Mostly the old-generation non-Roma dislike them, while the younger people and those from outside Romania (without the anti-Romani prejudices from the local context) appreciate their vitality. Acad. Constantin B«él«éceanu- Stolnici, a reputed anthropologist from Romania, declaredat Caravana romilor/Karavana le Romengi TV Show from 24 June 2007 that their different style is explained since in fact they are similar to the architectural style from North India, expressing the survival of the Desi cultural archetypes even after centuries of nomadism.

In 1367, Dienstweiler had its first documentary mention, and belonged to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim. The homestead of Eborn, which still exists today (roughly a kilometre outside the village itself) was formerly a self-administering municipality, but it merged with Dienstweiler sometime about 1544. As early as the time around 1000 BC, the area where Dienstweiler now lies took its first steps into the realm of history. It is known from archaeological finds made in the ‚ÄúAuf Brand‚Äù barrow fields that quite a few people must have lived here then. These were the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. They were followed by the Romans (58 BC to AD 400) from whose time come the foundations of a country house ‚Äì a villa rustica ‚Äì unearthed in the municipality. Also brought to light at this site was a bronze wine service, which today is a major draw at the Birkenfelder Landesmuseum (Birkenfeld State Museum). With the coming of the first permanent teacher, children from both Dienstweiler and Castle Birkenfeld were taught together beginning in 1785, although this institution did not last long. After it folded, Dienstweiler acquired its own school building in 1825, but this soon fell into such disrepair that it could no longer be used. At a municipal council meeting on 13 February 1849, it was decided that a new school would be built, and this was finished the following year. A new wing was built onto this school more than a century later, in 1955, and the school continued in this form until 1968, when school reform saw it close altogether. Now bereft of its original function, the school building gained a new purpose in 1985 when it was converted into a village community centre. The early 1960s were a time of progress. In 1962 and 1963, Dienstweiler became the first village in the Amt of Birkenfeld to build its own sewer system and central sewage treatment plant. In 1960, a new building zone was laid out; 49 houses were built there, which made necessary a further development to the north (hence the reference to the ‚Äúold new‚Äù building development). Although the inhabitants once drew their livelihoods mainly from agriculture, most now commute to jobs elsewhere in the area. Of the 26 agricultural operations that were once found here, only 4 are left.Dienstweiler‚Äôs history =Population development= *1958: 217 *1978: 267 *1998: 335 *2004: 320 (49.4% female) In 1998, Dienstweiler had 159 families living in 90 houses on 9 streets.

Written on May 15, 1956, it was attached to the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Pope Pius IX. The title is derived from , a verse which alludes to the abundance of the supernatural graces which flow from the heart of Christ. Haurietis aquas made the whole Church, and not merely the Jesuits, recognize the Sacred Heart as an important dimension of Christian spirituality.  The Sacred Heart Of Jesus  Pius XII gave two reasons why the Church gives the highest form of worship to the Heart of Jesus. The first rests on the principle whereby the believers recognise that Jesus' Heart is hypostatically united to the \\"Person of the Incarnate Son of God Himself\\". The second reason is derived from the fact that the Heart is the natural sign and symbol of Jesus' boundless love for humanity. The encyclical recalls that for human souls the wound in Christ's side and the marks left by the nails have been \\"the chief sign and symbol of that love\\" that ever more incisively shaped their life from within. The Pope describes several erroneous opinions regarding this devotion. There are those, who consider it burdensome and of little or no use to men. Others consider this devotion as a piety suited for women, and not for educated men. There are those who consider a devotion of this kind as primarily demanding penance, expiation and the other virtues which they call \\"passive,\\" meaning thereby that they produce no external results. Hence they do not think it suitable to re-enkindle the spirit of piety in modern times.Haurietis aquas, 11-13 The encyclical replies with Pope Pius XI: The veneration of the Sacred Heart is a summary of all our religion and, moreover, a guide to a more perfect life. It more easily leads our minds to know Christ the Lord intimately and more effectively turns our hearts to love Him more ardently and to imitate Him more perfectly.\\" Pius XI, Encl. \\"Miserentissimus Redemptor,\\" 8 May 1928 A.A.S. XX, 1928, p. 167. Haurietis aquas opines that the Sacred Heart never ceased, and never will cease, to beat with calm. It will never cease to symbolize the threefold love with which Jesus Christ is bound to His heavenly Father and the entire human race.Haurietis Aquas The Heart of Jesus Christ loves the human race but as a human and divine heart. It began to beat with love at once human and divine after the Virgin Mary generously pronounced her \\"Fiat\\".Haurietis aquas, 61 The Sacred Heart of Jesus shares in a most intimate way in the life of the Incarnate Word, and is thus a kind of instrument of the Divinity. Therefore, \\"in the carrying out of works of grace and divine omnipotence, His Heart, no less than the other members of His human nature is a symbol of that unbounded love\\".Haurietis aquas, 75  Excerpts  * After our Lord had ascended into heaven with His body adorned with the splendors of eternal glory and took His place by the right hand of the Father, He did not cease to remain with His Spouse, the Church, by means of the burning love with which His Heart beats. For He bears in His hands, feet and side the glorious marks of the wounds which manifest the threefold victory won over the devil, sin, and death.Haurietis aquas, 79 * Nothing therefore prevents our adoring the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ as having a part in and being the natural and expressive symbol of the abiding love with which the divine Redeemer is still on fire for mankind. Though it is no longer subject to the varying emotions of this mortal life, yet it lives and beats and is united inseparably with the Person of the divine Word and, in Him and through Him, with the divine Will. Since then the Heart of Christ is overflowing with love both human and divine and rich with the treasure of all graces which our Redeemer acquired by His life, sufferings and death, it is therefore the enduring source of that charity which His Spirit pours forth on all the members of His Mystical Body.Haurietis aquas, 85 Later Popes  Referring to paragraph 64 of Haurietis aquas, John Paul II wrote: \\"If through Christ's humanity [his] love shone on all mankind, the first beneficiaries were undoubtedly those whom the divine will had most intimately associated with itself: Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and Joseph, his presumed father\\". In a letter on May 15, 2006 Benedict XVI wrote: \\"By encouraging devotion to the Heart of Jesus, the Encyclical Haurietis aquas exhorted believers to open themselves to the mystery of God and of his love and to allow themselves to be transformed by it. After 50 years, it is still a fitting task for Christians to continue to deepen their relationship with the Heart of Jesus, in such a way as to revive their faith in the saving love of God and to welcome him ever better into their lives.\\"Letter of His Holiness Benedict XVI on the 50th anniversary of Haurietis Aquas As the encyclical states, From this source, the heart of Jesus, originates the true knowledge of Jesus Christ and a deeper experience of his love. Thus, according to Benedict XVI, we will be able to understand better what it means to know God's love in Jesus Christ, to experience him, keeping our gaze fixed on him to the point that we live entirely on the experience of his love, so that we can subsequently witness to it to others.

The Fischbach, coming from the Idar Forest, flows through the village. History In 1438, Fischbach had its first documentary mention when the Counts of Sponheim, who until this time had been the local lords, died out. Thereafter, ownership was jointly held by the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the upper Nahe between the Westrich, an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France, and the Hunsr√ºck. =Neighbouring municipalities= Frauenberg borders in the south on Reichenbach, in the west on Sonnenberg-Winnenberg, in the north on Idar- Oberstein and in the east on the Baumholder military reserve. History In early historical times, a road from Ausweiler ‚Äì a now vanished village that was evacuated to make way for the military reserve in 1937 ‚Äì passed by the Frauenburg (castle) and through the Nahe, running by way of Oberbrombach, Siesbach and Allenbach to the Moselle. Archaeological finds have established that there was a human presence in the Frauenberg area as early as 500 BC or thereabouts. On the Nahekopf (a hill overlooking Frauenberg) once stood a Celtic ringwall, and it is said that the castle itself was built on the ruins of a Roman fort. About 1330, Frauenberg had its first documentary mention. It was in this year that Countess Loretta (or Lauretta) von Sponheim moved into the Frauenburg; the castle served her as a widow's seat. Under this Sponheim castle's protection arose the village of Tal-Frauenberg (Tal is German for ‚Äúdale‚Äù or ‚Äúvalley‚Äù). By virtue of the Sponheims‚Äô good relations with the then German emperor, Louis the Bavarian, Tal-Frauenberg was granted town rights in 1332, at which time also arose the Amt of Frauenberg, which encompassed not only Tal-Frauenberg, but also Reichenbach, Ausweiler, Winnenberger-Hof, Hammerstein (nowadays an outlying centre of Idar-Oberstein), Homricher-Hof, Nohen and Rimsberg. However, nothing like a town, as the word is nowadays understood, ever grew out of Tal-Frauenberg. The village merely held more importance than other places in the area because it was the seat of a castle, which itself consisted of a manor house, a castle chapel, the comital mill, a tithe barn and a stone bridge over the Nahe. There was also a Sponheim Amtmann living there. In 1570, when the village was home to some eight families, the Amt of Frauenberg was dissolved and merged with the Amt of Birkenfeld. The Frauenburg was thus forsaken and left to fall into ruin, having lost its military importance with territorial changes and the rise of firearms, serving thereafter only as a refuge where the local people could flee and seek shelter in times of war. The parish of Reichenbach mentioned in 1655 that after the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), no-one was living in Tal-Frauenberg. The Niederbrombach church book mentioned in 1673 that French soldiers had attacked the castle, where inhabitants of surrounding villages had sought refuge. Several men were apparently killed. It is furthermore likely that the castle itself was heavily damaged in this attack. In 1682, there were once again people living in Tal-Frauenberg, although it was only three families. In 1761, Tal-Frauenberg was stricken by a great flood, brought on by several heavy storms. The flooding destroyed most of the houses and made the ones it left standing unfit for use. The population by this time was made up of 20 families ‚Äì some 100 persons, who were now all homeless. Thus it was that the Hochf√ºrstlich Sponheimische Gemeinschaftliche Regierung (the Sponheim government) at Trarbach decided to found two new villages. A group of 11 families were to be settled in Neu-Frauenberg (neu is German for ‚Äúnew‚Äù), while the other nine families were to be settled on the Sonnenberg (mountain). The government required that both new villages be built halfway up the slopes at their respective locations, to forestall any threat from flooding such as that that had destroyed Tal-Frauenberg. This was duly done, and to this day, both centres lie on slopes. Land had to be shared out at the new locations, and this was done by drawing lots. Farm lots were measured and pegged out. At Neu- Frauenberg, each one measured 4 √ó 4 Ruten, while at Sonnenberg they measured 10 √ó 4 Ruten, a Rute being the local version of the linear rood; a square Rute at that time ranged from 32 to 39 m¬≤. The new arrangement's consequences were that they only slowly recovered and began growing, and poverty and hardship reigned for a long time. By 1816, there were 19 families living in Frauenberg. Of the old village of Tal-Frauenberg, three houses are still standing in the ruins. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Sonnenberg belonged to the Principality of Birkenfeld, an Oldenburg territory, whereas Frauenberg belonged to the Principality of Lichtenberg, held by Saxe-Coburg, with its capital at Sankt Wendel. This put the two sister villages in two separate states and made the river Nahe, which at the time the two new villages had been established had been designated the municipal boundary, into a border. In 1834, Frauenberg became Prussian. Economic progress in the village came only with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Sometime around 1850, the two grinding mills on the river Nahe west of the village came into being, but these were torn down between 1931 and 1935. With the opening of the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) in 1860 ‚Äì single-tracked until 1882 ‚Äì came transport links for the first time between the Nahe Valley and both the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and the Saarland. In 1880, Sonnenberg station came into service, whereupon many Frauenbergers found work in Idar-Oberstein, the Saarland and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. This also brought about population growth: by 1910 there were 51 families. After the First World War, electricity came to Frauenberg, allowing many agate, gem and diamond cutters to set up their workshops at home. The upshot from the First World War, of course, was the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated, among other things, that 26 of the Sankt Wendel district's 94 municipalities ‚Äì including the like- named district seat but not including Frauenberg ‚Äì had to be ceded to the British- and French-occupied Saarland. The remaining 68 municipalities then bore the designation ‚ÄúRestkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder‚Äù, with the first syllable of Restkreis having the same meaning as in English, in the sense of ‚Äúleft over‚Äù. As the last element of the name suggests, Baumholder was the seat of this ‚Äúleftover‚Äù district. This situation persisted until 1937 when St. Wendel-Baumholder was merged with the Oldenburg territory of Birkenfeld to form today's Birkenfeld district. With this, Sonnenberg and Frauenberg were once again united under the name Birkenfeld, as they had once been centuries earlier. In 1938, Frauenberg lost roughly 40 ha of its municipal area to the new military reserve. The municipality of Frauenberg originally belonged to the Amt administration of Baumholder, but since 1969, it has been one of the 14 Ortsgemeinden in the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder. Unlike other municipalities in the Verbandsgemeinde, Frauenberg's population has undergone steady growth since the war, rising from 356 in 1950 to some 500 in 1986. This owes itself mainly to relatively strong activity in the building sector beginning in 1972 and the municipality's favourable location only 7 km from Idar-Oberstein. In 1979, Frauenberg brought the first modern biological sewage treatment plant in the Verbandsgemeinde into service. The village's expansion also occasioned the updating of sewerage with new, bigger pipes.Frauenberg‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Frauenberg's mayor is Helmut Herrmann.Frauenberg‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per bend sinister chequy gules and argent and vert issuant from base a castle Or masoned and windowed sable and sinister a countess proper crowned of the fourth and crined of the fifth couped at the midriff. The ‚Äúchequy‚Äù part of the shield is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim and the Oberamt of Birkenfeld. The two charges in base are canting for the origin of the municipality's name, a woman (Frau) and a castle (Burg). The woman, of course, is the one who moved into the castle, Countess Loretta (or Lauretta) von Sponheim, and the castle was called Frauenburg (not Frauenberg with an E, which is pronounced differently and means ‚ÄúWoman‚Äôs Mountain‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúWoman‚Äôs Castle‚Äù).Description and explanation of Frauenberg‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Railway bridge on the Nahe Valley Railway ‚Äì three-arch bridge built of sandstone quarrystones set with brick over the Nahe valley, about 1860 * Frauenburg ruin, south of the village on a narrow mountain spur (monumental zone) ‚Äì small, regular complex, possibly from the early 14th century; girding wall, four round corner towers, round tower in northeast wall, twin-halled cellar, partial moat, nested walls Along the left bank of the Lahn River, sandstone hills rise and extend to the edge of the community of Ebsdorfergrund, culminating in a natural peak upon which stand the ruins of the Castle Frauenberg. In 1248 Sophie von Brabant, daughter of St. Elizabeth of Hungary and widow of Duke Heinrich von Brabant, came to Marburg to claim her late husband's Thuringian inheritance. Sophie had the castle built in 1252 on the basalt peak that became commonly known as the Frauenberg, or, the woman's peak. By the year 1489 the castle lay in ruins and the site was used as a quarry. Today the site remains are a popular destination, enjoyed for the grand panorama. On clear days one has an incomparable view in all directions and can spot nearly forty villages and cities before the horizon. The vista can reach as far as the mountains Hohe Meissner or Feldberg in Taunus. Frauenberg is one of a total of seven Huguenot villages in Hesse that were founded between 1686 and 1706. Economy and infrastructure =Transport= To the north runs Bundesstra√üe 41 and to the south runs the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier). There is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) in Idar-Oberstein. =Economy= The jewellery industry is still an important sector of the municipality's economy, subject though it may be to structural changes to which small and family-run operations have fallen victim. Agriculture has since the early 1970s been unknown in Frauenberg. The loss of a great deal of farmland to the military reserve in the time of the Third Reich and the rather vast proportion of the municipal area (roughly 65%) covered by forest have not favoured agriculture.

Groups and courses The church runs several midweek groups and courses, aimed at a wide variation of people. =Life Course= The Life Course is an eight week course run three times annually, which aims to enable participants to explore the various meanings assigned to life. The aim of the course is to provide an open platform to discuss viewpoints and explore more than would be typically catered for in a church service or outreach course. As such, it does not require any particular belief or faith. Those who would describe themselves as agnostic or atheist are just as welcome as those of the Christian faith as well as other faiths: in the past, members of the Sunday Assembly have undertaken the course. Participants meet downstairs in the church hall for dinner, following which an introductory presentation is made, aiming to stimulate discussion in smaller groups. Over the course, themes include: \\"What meaning do we give our lives?\\", \\"Where do people look for meaning?\\", \\"What evidence is there that true meaning can be found?\\" and \\"What difference does true meaning make?\\" alongside others. The course also includes an optional weekend away.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the M√∂rschbach in the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest) in the Hunsr√ºck, on the boundary with the Saarland. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Gimbweiler is the outlying homestead of Heidehof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 19 (PDF) History The oldest forms of Gimbweiler's name are Gumbweiler (1397), Gompwiler (1480) and Gympwiler (1480). Gimbweiler may be of Roman origin, as the now vanished hamlet of Frudesweiler may have been, too, but this cannot be proved. Gimbweiler's history unfolded much like neighbouring Wolfersweiler's (nowadays an outlying centre of Nohfelden). Gimbweiler always belonged to that village's high court and parish, while the lords through the Middle Ages were the Bishops of Verdun, the Counts of Veldenz and the Dukes of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken. In the 13th century, the Lords of Oberstein tried to gain a foothold in the villages that lay between Wolfersweiler and Baumholder. They renewed these attempts in the centuries that followed, bolstered by their enfeoffments from the Duchy of Lorraine. The Obersteins had had holdings in Gimbweiler from days of yore. The Veldenzes and the Zweibr√ºckens, though, held some lordly rights and ownership, too, jealously guarding and forcefully expanding them. In 1397, for instance, Count Friedrich von Veldenz bought from the Lords of Broich, besides landholdings, interests and rights at Eckelnhusen (Eckelhausen, nowadays an outlying centre of Nohfelden), Hanwilre (Hahnweiler), and Moysberg, an estate and some paupers at Gumpwiler. After 1432, Gimbweiler and Frudesweiler, along with the neighbouring villages of Freisen, Hoppst√§dten, Hahnweiler and Reitscheid (nowadays an outlying centre of Freisen), belonged to the Obersteins‚Äô great Lotharingian fief; the enfeoffment document laying out this arrangement was first put into force in this year, and was continually renewed until 1667. The Lotharingians, as well as their fiefholders, the Obersteins, always held on to their claims to Gimbweiler, even after the Oberstein-Falkensteins further enfeoffed the Lord of Schillards of Feigniss with the village in 1599. In reality, however, Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken hegemony over Gimbweiler was not questioned. In Napoleonic times, Gimbweiler and neighbouring Wolfersweiler belonged to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Nohfelden, which in turn belonged to the canton of Baumholder. In 1640, it seems that Frudesweiler was still in existence, but by 1740, the historical record reports that it was in decay. The people of Gimbweiler and Weiersbach exercised grazing rights here, the legal disputes over which continued into the 19th century. The question was settled with a compromise: Weiersbach got two fifths of Frudesweiler's area, mostly woodland, while the other three fifths, mostly cropland and meadow, went to Gimbweiler.according to Prof. H. Baldes Religion Most of the residents belong to the Wolfersweiler Evangelical Church.

PC3 cells are useful in investigating biochemical changes in advanced prostate cancer cells and in assessing their response to chemotherapeutic agents. PC3 cells are also used to study viral infection in mammalian cells that exhibit an immune response PC3 cell cultured in plastic plate Actin (Phalloidin) and Nuclei (DAPI) staining Description The PC3 cell line was established in 1979 from bone metastasis of grade IV of prostate cancer in a 62-year-old Caucasian male. These cells do not respond to androgens, glucocorticoids or fibroblast growth factors, but results suggest that the cells are influenced by epidermal growth factors. PC3 cells can be used to create subcutaneous tumor xenografts in mice to investigate the tumor environment and therapeutic drug functionality. PC3 cells have high metastatic potential compared to DU145 cells, which have a moderate metastatic potential, and to LNCaP cells, which have low metastatic potential. Comparisons of the protein expression of PC3, LNCaP, and other cells have shown that PC3 is characteristic of small cell neoendocrine carcinoma. PC3 cells have low testosterone-5-alpha reductase and acidic phosphatase activity, and do not express PSA (prostate-specific antigen). Furthermore, karyotypic analysis has shown that PC3 are near- triploid, having 62 chromosomes. Q-band analysis showed no Y chromosome. From a morphological point of view, electron microscopy revealed that PC3 cells show characteristics of a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma. They have features common to neoplastic cells of epithelial origins, such as numerous microvilli, junctional complexes, abnormal nuclei and nucleoli, abnormal mitochondria, annulate lamellae, and lipoidal bodies.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the edge of the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest) in the Hunsr√ºck. =Neighbouring municipalities= Gollenberg borders in the south on Birkenfeld, and Ellenberg, in the west on Rinzenberg and in the north on Oberhambach. History In 1415, Gollenberg had its first documentary mention under the name Gulderberg. By 1440 this had become Golderberg, by 1540 Guldenberg. By 1580, this had become the form still used today, Gollenberg. The village belonged to the \\"Hinder\\" County of Sponheim. Gollenberg's history is tightly bound with Birkenfeld's. That town's church books and official records contain many references to Gollenberg. The years 1642, 1650 and 1686 brought the villagers disaster. The hardship during the 17th century can perhaps be best seen in the sharp drop in the number of households in Gollenberg. In 1615 there were 19 of these, but by 1655, this had fallen to 5. It is likely that it was at this time that the village of H√∂hweiler, which once lay within what are now Gollenberg's limits, vanished. Gollenberg is among the villages whose municipal areas were carved out of what was once Birkenfeld's municipal area. It is known that there were boundary disputes in 1766 with Rinzenberg, Schwollen and Hambach, and in 1770 with Birkenfeld and Schmi√überg as well, suggesting that municipal separation from Birkenfeld was complete by this time. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna assigned the Birkenfelder Land to the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, who took charge of his new holding on 16 April 1817, naming it the Principality of Birkenfeld. On 1 April 1937, under the Greater Hamburg Act, the old principality was absorbed into Prussia, which was still a distinct entity during the Third Reich. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate. On 17 March 1945, Gollenberg once again suffered. Anti-aircraft batteries (\\"Flak\\") left over from an otherwise destroyed regiment set themselves up around Gollenberg. Along with them came a mortar detachment and many small-calibre anti-aircraft weapons. Advance detachments of infantry and military engineers arrived as well. Gollenberg soon resembled an army camp. Towards 16:00, when artillery bombardment began on the municipal woodlands, in which the detachments and all vehicles were located, as was a supply depot that had not yet been emptied, it was decided to shift the combat vehicles to a new position in another wood, the Sch√∂nenwald. Well into the afternoon, the weather thwarted any Allied air attacks, but when the clouds broke up, Allied fliers were already there. The combat vehicle drivers who already found themselves in the village, simply drove up to the houses to take cover. This resulted in a 20-minute-long fighter-bomber attack in which eight Allied aircraft dived at their targets, both dropping bombs and firing their on-board weapons. All too many times, they hit the village's houses instead, and it was not long before flames were leaping up from them. Jerrycans and munitions were also exploding, aggravating the already dangerous situation. By nightfall, five properties lay in rubble and ashes. At two properties, the commercial building burnt down, and two sheds fell victim to the flames. Luckily, no lives were lost. At four properties, the fires were put out in time. Even the livestock was saved. On 22 May 1952, the double municipality of Gollenberg- Ellenberg, which had been in existence since 1 April 1934 was dissolved, and the two separate municipalities of Ellenberg and Gollenberg were reconstituted.Gollenberg's history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Gollenberg‚Äôs mayor is Ralf Simon, and his deputies are Holger Sander and Karin Fetzer Fuchs.Gollenberg‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister chequy gules and argent, and vert issuant from base a mount of three Or.

To its east is the Kyrbach valley. G√∂senroth is a linear village (by some definitions of the word, a thorpe). =Neighbouring municipalities= G√∂senroth's neighbours are Laufersweiler, Schwerbach, Rhaunen and Weitersbach. All but Laufersweiler, which lies in the Rhein-Hunsr√ºck-Kreis, lie within the Birkenfeld district. History The oldest archaeological finds that yield evidence of settlement within what are now G√∂senroth's limits come from the first and early second century AD. These finds were made in 1936 by the Landesmuseum Trier (Trier State Museum) on the road between G√∂senroth and Schwerbach (bordering on Laufersweiler). While some woods were being cleared, seven barrows were discovered. Unearthed by digs at these barrows were, among other things, an iron hatchet, several amphorae, pots, urns, a spindle whorl, a pair of fibulae, two coins (one with Emperor Nero‚Äôs effigy from sometime between AD 64 and 68) and a bronze armband. In the latest of these graves (2nd century AD), an iron stylus was found. It was also believed that some of the finds were from an abode of some kind. In the local speech, G√∂senroth is known as Gesad, and indeed, over time, the name has undergone shifts from Gossenroth to Goesenrat, Goisenrait, Gossenrait, and finally G√∂senroth. About the name‚Äôs meaning there is only speculation. The ending ‚Äîroth is of Frankish origin and points to a foundation about the turn of the second millennium as a clearing (Rodung in German) in the forest. On 5 May 1367, the Lords of Senheim were mentioned as the village‚Äôs lords. On 14 June 1464, Wilhelm, Vogt of Senheim and his sister Eva von Senheim, who was married to Werner von L√∂wenstein, ceded the village of Goisenrait to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. On the old track between Rhaunen and Hochscheid (in the cadastral area known as Gonsenbach), remnants of a long-vanished village could still be made out as late as 1938. According to oral history, this village‚Äôs name was Batzenroth, it had 16 houses, and in 1642 it burnt down. Not long thereafter, it was stricken by the Plague. The oldest building still standing in the municipality is the estate of Giehl, built by Rhinegrave Ludwig Wilhelm in 1654. The so-called Fu√üm√ºhle (\\"Foot Mill\\"), which in the last few years has been restored and is now fully functional, once belonged to Castle Dill. The basic material of today's building may go back to 1830. The Evangelical church was built in 1844 and 1845 on the site where once stood a smaller chapel, and was consecrated in 1848.

It stars Imanol Arias, Victoria Abril and Francisco Rabal. Set in the 1940s, in the early days of the Franco‚Äôs regime, the plot follows the story of an ambitious doctor who is accused of killing a woman while he tried to save her life after a botched abortion. The film is an intriguing tale of sex, death and alienation with philosophical overtones. Plot The story is set in Madrid in the late 1940s early 1950s during the first years of Franco‚Äôs regime. Pedro Mart√≠n, a young ambitious doctor, is studying the effect of cancerous cells on mice, but he has run out of mice in his laboratory, since they do not breed there, and he has no funds to purchase more of these expensive laboratory animals from the United States. Nevertheless, his assistant, Amador, informs him that he gave some of the mice to an old rag dealer, nicknamed \\"el Muecas\\", who lives in precarious conditions in a shanty town outside Madrid, and that this poor man has successfully bred them with the help of the natural heat of his daughters. The incredulous scientist goes to the shanty town to obtain the mice. There, Pedro meets Muecas, Muecas's wife Ricarda and their two daughters Florita and Conchi. With the warmth of the women's breasts, as the flirtatious Florita shows Pedro, the mice are able to reproduce. Pedro himself lives in a modest boarding house run by a military widow and her daughter Dora, who also has a vivacious daughter, Dorita. The owner of the boarding house tries to encourage the doctor to fall in love with his granddaughter, Dorita, so that his medical career may release them all from a life of squalor and penury. During her birthday reunion, Dorita clearly shows Pedro that she is interested in him. Pedro and his rich friend Mat√≠as discuss literature and painting in a caf√© and later they go out for a night of heavy partying in a house of prostitution in which Mat√≠as gets involves with a prostitute that closely resembles his own mother. Returning to his boarding house, Pedro goes to Dorita's bed. He excuses himself for being drunk, but she welcomes his advances and they make love, starting a relationship. Pedro is awakened at dawn by Muecas who needs his help as a doctor and begs him to save the life of his daughter, Florita, who is severely hemorrhaging after a botched abortion. Pedro tries to do what he can to save the girl's life, but she dies in spite of his efforts. With the horrific death of her sister, Conchi reveals that Muecas was the father of the dead child in an incestuous relationship with his own daughter. Cartucho, a low life tough guy, boyfriend of the butchered Florita, is jealous of the doctor and after talking to Amador, extracts a false confession. Amador makes him wrongly believe that Pedro is guilty of having aborted the child and killed the mother. Later that day, Pedro is sought by the local police. Dorita warns him and Pedro hides in the local brothel run by Do√±a Luisa. Meanwhile, Matias begs Amador to tell the police the truth of Pedro's innocence, but Amador refuses to cooperate. The police finally apprehend Pedro, who surprisingly confesses rather than admit the truth because of the absurdity of the situation. Ricarda, Florita's mother, follows the remains of her deceased daughter to the place where the autopsy is performed. She can not calm down and is arrested for interrupting the medical examiners. Meanwhile, Pedro's girlfriend, Dorita and Matias try to help him using Matias's influences in order to set Pedro free, but they do not succeed. However, in the commissary, Ricarda, realizing that the doctor has wrongly been accused of her daughter's death, tells what has happened. Her testimony saves the doctor from prison. To celebrate his freedom, Pedro and Dorita go to a funfair. They have been followed by Cartucho, who jealously watches Pedro dance with Dorita. Still believing that Pedro is guilty of Florita's death, Cartucho takes advantage of a moment in which Pedro is away buying some sweets and stabs Dorita. When Pedro returns just a moment later, Dorita is already dead. Cast The role of Dorita was significantly expanded from the novel to take advantage of Victoria Abril, marketability as an actress, to add explicit sex scenes and to contrast the passivity of Pedro's character with Dorita vivacity. *Imanol Arias as Pedro *Victoria Abril as Dorita *Francisco Rabal as Muecas *Juan Echanove as Matias *Charo L√≥pez as Charo/ Matias‚Äô mother *Joaqu√≠n Hinojosa as Cartucho *Francisco Algora as Amador *Diana Pe√±alver as Conchi *Blanca Apil√°nez as Pilar *Enriqueta Claver as Luisa Themes Incest, death and alienation, are the three major themes of the film. Aranda added a literary and philosophical dimension to the screenplay.Schwartz, The Great Spanish Films, p. 73 The film is about government failure; individual loss of responsibility, and urban poverty. The story is framed in the post civil war years under the shadow of Franco's regime and the yearning for freedom and enlightenment. Analysis Tiempo de Silencio is an accurate representation of Spain post civil war period, a denunciation of the reality of Franco's Spain in the 1950s, from which Aranda himself emigrated in 1952, the same period in which the action takes place. The film adheres to an unforgiving neorealist aesthetic. The nightmarish scene of the abortion Pedro performs on the dying Florita famously includes the chilling sound of the scalpel scraping her womb. The intrusive shots at the autopsy are extremely harsh, in keeping with the explicit portrayal of sex and violence that characterizes Aranda's filmography. Aranda transformed Mart√≠n Santos's linguistically suggestive time of ‚Äòsilence‚Äù into a visually expressive time of ‚Äòentrapment‚Äù; furthermore the almost complete absence of music on the soundtrack has been more literally related to the novel's title. The film opens with images of caged dogs, bandaged from injuries sustained during experiments in the laboratory. The recurrent images of entrapment is not just a playful prefiguration of Pedro's literal imprisonment, but a sober portrayal of Francoist Spain as a figurative society of imprisonment. The final sequence resembles the murder scene in Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs Strangers on a Train (1951) as Cartucho stalks his victim, and like Hitchcock, points to the incongruity between the jaunty fairground music and the brutal murder. The film, unlike the novel that was based upon, brings out the oppressive atmosphere of Spain's post-civil war years. When Spain was seeking enlightenment and freedom but was strangled in the vortex of darkness, ignorance and day to day survival. There is no let-up to the pessimism. Aranda's work is bleak, ugly, beautiful; and unrelenting. The final voice over of Pedro in his laboratory regarding his sense of futility and oppression both underscores the meaning of the title of the film and lends it an air of literariness of the original narrative.Deveney, Cain on Screen, p. 259 Just as Mart√≠n Santos's novel portrays a Spain that is backward and repressed, with its intellectuals trapped in a time of silence, so too does the cinematographic adaptation by Vicente Aranda. Aranda's version of the absurd world in which Pedro lives does not depend on the subtle ironies of the literary text, however; instead some scenes elicited overt laughter from the audience. Reception Tiempo de Silencio was criticized for failing to match the highly regarded novel on which it was based. The novel written by Mart√≠n Santos has a labyrinthine fragmented structure and an ironic narrator. It has been described as \\"a novel written by an intellectual, about intellectuals and intended to be read by intellectuals\\". However, there is general recognition in contemporary reviews and subsequent scholarly criticism that Tiempo de Silencio is one of the most artistically successful literary adaptations of the 1980s in Spain's filmography. DVD release Tiempo de Silencio was released on a region 2 DVD on June 19, 2007. The film is in Spanish only. There are no English subtitles. The extras include an interview with director Vicente Aranda and actors Imanol Arias and Juan Echanove.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies in the Hunsr√ºck at the southwesternmost end of the Birkenfeld district and the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder. In the south it borders on the Saarland. With its 218 inhabitants ‚Äì which includes those who hold only a secondary residence here ‚Äì (as at 31 January 2011), Hahnweiler is the third smallest municipality in the Verbandsgemeinde. By land area ‚Äì the municipal area measures only 228.5 ha ‚Äì it is the smallest. Its elevation ranges between 450 and 552 m above sea level.Geographical data =Neighbouring municipalities= Hahnweiler borders in the northeast on R√ºckweiler, in the south on Freisen in the Saarland, in the west on Gimbweiler and Nohfelden-Wolfersweiler, also in the Saarland, and in the north on Leitzweiler. History Hahnweiler, or Hanwilre as it was known in the Middle Ages, belonged to the comital House of Tholey holdings in the Moselgau (a territory that stretched along the Moselle). The Vogtei rights over the Moselgau were granted Count Gerlach V in 1235 by the Bishop of Verdun. By 1397, Count Friedrich von Veldenz had bought from Geretrud Broich, her son Emmerich and his wife the estate, along with its serfs, interests and rights at Hanwilre and Moysberg (now Mosberg, part of Mosberg-Richweiler, itself an outlying centre of Nohfelden) for 50 Rhenish guilders. In the time that followed, the village belonged to the Amt of Nohfelden and thereby to the Oberamt of Lichtenberg. After the Nohfelden Gerichtsweistum (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times; Gericht means ‚Äúcourt‚Äù), the rightful judges of the high court were deemed to be the Counts Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken. Hahnweiler was part of the great fief given Wirich II of Oberstein in 1432 by the Duke of Lorraine. The 1480 Bede register (the Bede was a kind of taxation) lists for Hahnweiler two inhabitants who had to pay the May Bede and three who had to pay the autumn Bede. Wendel Gelzenleichter, his wife Agnes, son Nickel and daughter Elisa from Hahnweiler were Oberstein serfs in 1603. Wendel performed ‚Äúalong with the thresher at Hanwiller and his fellow heirs at Ber√üwiller a goods transport for the Count of Oberstein. As to further compulsory service, the said Wendel yearly gave the Count some money, about 1 Thaler. What else he yearly gave in money and produce in levies has not been determined.‚Äù The 1675 description of the Oberamt compiled by D. K√∂nig after the Thirty Years' War counted two families in Hahnweiler, while 115 years later, there were 18 families in the village. In 1816, 13 houses, 14 families and 94 souls were counted. The village‚Äôs Reformed parishioners were parochially bound with Wolfersweiler before French Revolutionary times, and thereafter with Berschweiler. The Catholics belonged to the parish of Freisen. Until 1793, Hahnweiler was part of the Zweibr√ºcken Amt of Nohfelden. The municipal boundary between Hahnweiler and R√ºckweiler was also the old boundary between the Rohrbach and Nohfelden court regions. During the French occupation, the village belonged to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Nohfelden in the canton of Baumholder. Beginning in 1819, after the Congress of Vienna, it was part of the B√ºrgermeisterei (also ‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Berschweiler. In 1819, Hahnweiler had 13 families and 107 souls; by 1843, these figures had grown to 21 and 131 respectively.Hahnweiler‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayors= Hahnweiler‚Äôs mayor is Dietmar Schmitt, and his deputies are J√ºrgen Loch and Heiko Bier.

They have performed over 1,500 shows in 13 countries and 43 US states. The band have released three albums and four singles since their first release in 2001. They have also signed with multiple record companies including Blue Hand Records, 33rd Street Records During time on tour, the band was introduced to another rock band, Bowling For Soup. Later, both bands became the co co-creators of the Get Happy Tour, that launched in 2006. As a result of the Global Financial Crisis, the band suffered with finding a record label that would sign them. However they took matters into their own hands with seeking additional crowd funded projects including acoustic EPs, writing and film production. History =Early years (1997‚Äì2000)= Following his graduation from Lower Cape May Regional High School in Cape May, New Jersey, Chris Jay moved by himself to Ventura, California with the goal of starting a band. Having written hundreds of songs, Jay started out playing solo acoustic at local open mics and coffeehouses. Jay officially formed Army of Freshmen at the end of 1997 with Owen Bucey, Aaron Goldberg, Dan Clark, One' Nielsen, Mike Rini and Jon Blackburn all of whom he met at a Ventura coffeehouse he performed at regularly. Jay's new bandmates were all recent graduates of Buena High School and Ventura High School. The band initially performed as Chris Jay and the Army of Freshmen but after a few months of local shows, they began going by just Army of Freshmen. Initially Goldberg and Clark played trumpet and trombone while Jay played guitar but the band moved Clark to keyboard and Goldberg to guitar which created the dual keyboard-driven pop punk that the band is known for. In 2000 the band went on their first tour, 2 weeks on the east coast, in the same minivan Jay left home in. The tour was booked completely independent of any manager, label or agent. =Army of Freshmen (2001‚Äì2003)= On the strength of a 3-song demo and a large Ventura area fan base, in 2000, the band was discovered by music manager, Rod Ensminger, who signed them to his label, Blue Hand Records. In 2001 the band released their self-titled debut which was produced by Jay Ferguson, a member of the 60's rock band Spirit. To support their debut full-length release, Army of Freshmen toured in the summer of 2001 on the Moto Music Madness Tour, a freestyle motocross meets music tour that played over 50 dates across the USA including a handful of dates on the Warped Tour. At the end of 2002, Nielsen left the band and was replaced by Kai Dodson, a Ventura musician who was close friends with the band. Around the same time, the band was signed to a label in Japan who released their self-titled album in that country in 2003. To support the release Army of Freshmen was invited to play Summersonic, a major music festival in Japan alongside major artists like Radiohead and The Doors. This led to Army of Freshmen's first international attention when, despite being the least known act at the festival, their set received rave reviews in the Japanese music press. While on a few random dates of the 2003 Warped Tour, Army of Freshmen met Bowling For Soup who would become close friends and collaborators. Bowling For Soup invited Army of Freshmen on their 2003 fall tour. Initially just booked to be on a few shows, Bowling For Soup, insisted that Army of Freshmen stay on for the entire tour, an act that Jay described as, \\"An above and a beyond act of kindness that totally changed our band's career.\\" =Beg, Borrow, Steal (2004‚Äì2005)= The band signed with 33rd Street Records, an indie label which was owned by Tower Records and entered the studio to record their second album, Beg, Borrow, Steal in late 2003. The album included the single \\"Get Um Up,\\" which spent 5 weeks in the top 20 on the U.S. Alternative radio specialty charts. Following the release of Beg, Borrow, Steal in 2004, the band returned to Japan supporting The Living End. While on the Warped Tour in 2004, drummer Mike Rini left the band abruptly at one of the tour's Canadian dates. Mike Milligan, a drummer from Chicago whose previous band had played several shows with Army of Freshmen, joined shortly thereafter. After the Warped Tour, the band toured the United Kingdom for the first time. A compilation by Brand New Hero Records featuring Army of Freshmen songs, entitled Casino Chips and Sunset Strips, was released in the UK to coincide with the tour. The tour ended with Army of Freshmen being asked to open for Bowling For Soup for 3 of that band's tour dates in the United Kingdom.Review of Casino Chips and Sunset Strips. Punknews.org Staff Review, July 13, 2004. In 2005 the band did a headlining summer tour still in support of Beg, Borrow, Steal and returned to the United Kingdom that fall for a sold- out tour opening for Bowling For Soup. In support of the tour, they released an EP, At the End Of the Day, which was recorded in Texas and produced by Jaret Reddick of Bowling For Soup. =Under the Radar (2006‚Äì2007)= In 2006, the band released their third album, Under the Radar, which featured the single, \\"Juliet\\". The dodgeball themed video received moderate play on United Kingdom music channels like Kerrang and Scuzz TV. The record would be their first with their longtime producer, Jay Ruston. In the summer of 2006, Army of Freshmen and Bowling For Soup created and appeared on the Get Happy Tour,Review of Above the Atmosphere. The Skinny, October 3, 2008. (Cached copy) a popular package tour that traveled the United States in 2006 and 2007, The United Kingdom twice in 2007 and also did a short European run in 2017. The tour featured fan interaction events and a family-friendly show. Other bands that appeared alongside AOF and BFS on the various Get Happy Tours included The Bloodhound Gang, Zebrahead, Wheatus, Son of Dork, Punchline, Lucky Boys Confusion, Quiet Drive and Melee. 2007 proved to be Army of Freshmen busiest year with multiple tours in the United Kingdom, their first UK festival appearance at the Download Festival, their first trip to mainland Europe supporting Reel Big Fish and the previously mentioned Get Happy Tours which played to sold-out venues in the United Kingdom. =Above The Atmosphere (2008‚Äì2009)= The band's fourth album, Above the Atmosphere, was released in 2008 and the single \\"No One's Famous\\" again received airplay on UK Television. The band did their first ever headline tours of the United Kingdom in the spring and fall and again appeared at the Download Festival. They did a headline tour that summer in the United States. After years of touring independently and surviving primarily on merchandise sales, just as Army of Freshmen was set to sign to a major label, the global economic crisis hit. The label they were negotiating a deal with froze all signings for the remainder of the year and the A&R; man who was negotiating the deal was laid off shortly thereafter. In addition, a new indie label the band had just begun working with folded suddenly leaving the band responsible for debt the label incurred in the band's name. In May 2009, the band toured China for the first time where they played to the biggest crowds of their career appearing at the Midi Festival and Zebra Festival where they were the only artist from the US to perform. =Close Encounter EP (2010‚Äì2011)= The band released the Close Encounter EP in 2010. The EP was available for download for a pay-what-you- like model. The video for the EP's single, \\"Body Parts\\" received minor airplay on United Kingdom video channels. The band returned to the United Kingdom for a short headline tour and an appearance at the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth, England. In the spring of 2011, Army of Freshmen opened the main stage at the Groezrock Festival in Belgium. In addition to Groezrock, they performed at the Artefacts Festival in France, the Paaspop Festival in the Netherlands and headlined a week of shows in the United Kingdom.Review of UK show. Alter The Press, April 16, 2011. At the end of 2011, the band returned to the United Kingdom for their 10th visit, this time touring with Zebrahead.Zebrahead & Army of Freshmen Meet & Greet. Alter the Press, October 2011. =Happy To Be Alive (2012‚Äì2016)= The band's fifth record, Happy To Be Alive, was self-released in 2013 and was crowd-funded. Fans who contributed to the making of the record received an acoustic EP, Campfire Classics. Despite Happy To Be Alive receiving the best reviews of their career which cited the record's lyrical maturity and less pop-punk direction, the record failed to sell well or receive much attention outside of the band's most hardcore fans. Army of Freshmen only toured once in support of the record, with a 2014 tour in the United Kingdom with Lit. After the Lit tour, the band went on hiatus for the first time since their inception, though it was not officially announced. During this time, band members engaged in a variety of side projects, including Jay and Goldberg writing, co-producing, and releasing the independent comedy film, The Bet. =20th Anniversary (2017‚Äìpresent)= In a surprise announcement on September 22, 2017, Army of Freshmen released the news that they would be celebrating their 20th Anniversary in February 2018 with the return of the Get Happy Tour in the United Kingdom. Army of Freshmen once again joined Bowling For Soup and special guests, The Aquabats for the first Get Happy Tour in 11 years. The band also played an anniversary show in their hometown (Ventura, CA) in October 2018. In late 2019 and early 2020, the band released three new singles, \\"Well May Her World Go Round,\\" \\"Everything is Beautiful,\\" and \\"Promise.\\" Recorded by John Sveiven at Arkive Studios in Ventura, these recordings marked the first release of new Army of Freshmen music since 2012's Happy to Be Alive.

Beach Boys Lawsuit Chris Jay is a frequent contributor to the VC Reporter, a weekly newspaper in print and online in Ventura County and has interviewed hundreds of artists. In 2003 he was sued for 10 million dollars by Mike Love of the Beach Boys over an article he wrote on Love and his fronting current line up of the Beach Boys despite having no original members. The case never went to trial and was settled out of court, but all the members of Army of Freshmen had to give depositions during the discovery period of the case. Most Army of Freshmen fans and even Beach Boys fans are unaware that the lawsuit ever existed as it was settled out of court by before any media was made aware of the suit.

Akha man in Thailand smoking opium pipe An opium pipe is a pipe designed for the evaporation and inhalation of opium. True opium pipes allow for the opiate to be vaporized while being heated over a special oil lamp known as an opium lamp. It is thought that this manner of \\"smoking\\" opium began in the seventeenth century when a special pipe was developed that vaporized opium instead of burning it. The configuration of the typical opium pipe consists of a long stem, a ceramic pipe-bowl, and a metal fitting, known as the \\"saddle\\", through which the pipe-bowl plugs into the pipe-stem. The pipe-bowl must be detachable from the stem due to the necessity to remove the bowl and scrape its insides clean of opium ash after several pipes have been smoked. The stems of opium pipes were usually made from bamboo, but other materials such as ivory and silver were used. Pipe-bowls were typically a type of ceramic, such as blue and white porcelain. Sometimes opium pipe-bowls were carved from more valuable materials such as jade. Because of its design, the opium pipe needed an opium lamp in order to function. The lamp was as highly specialized as the pipe, and was designed to channel the required amount of heat upon the pipe-bowl so that the opium would vaporise and allow the smoker to inhale the vapors. Due to opium eradication campaigns in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, genuine opium pipes are now extremely rare. In the early 20th century, opium pipes were often called dream sticks. Something that is a \\"pipe dream\\" is a metaphorical reference to an unattainable or fanciful hope or scheme.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the east side of a ridge between the Idarbach and the Siesbach in the Vorderhunsr√ºck and borders directly on the town of Idar- Oberstein. The municipal area measures 532 ha, of which some 120 ha is state forest. The actual village itself covers 29 ha. The municipal area has a rather odd shape, which has given it its unusually long municipal limit of roughly 20 km. The village centrepoint has an elevation of 410 m above sea level, and the municipality's highest point, the fort near Kirschweiler, lies at 623 m above sea level. Hettenrodt lies on the Deutsche Edelsteinstra√üe (‚ÄúGerman Gem Road‚Äù) and within both the Naturpark Saar-Hunsr√ºck and the Wildenburg hiking area. History Of protohistoric times in what is now Hettenrodt, very little is known. It is likely, however, that running over the ridge set north-south between the Idarbach and the Siesbach (two small rivers), from the Silberich towards the Steinkaulenberg (two mountains) was a Roman road. Since the Romans used, cared for and even guarded all springs that lay near their roads, it can be assumed that at that time ‚Äì about the year 1 ‚Äì there was already a small settlement, or perhaps a fort, on the ‚ÄúKremel‚Äù. There is no doubt that the Sielburg, a site lying in the cadastral area known as Flur 1, within Hettenrodt's limits, which is sometimes mistakenly called the Kirschweiler Festung (‚ÄúKirschweiler Fort‚Äù), is a prehistoric ringwall that, as archaeological finds have shown, was also used in Roman and Carolingian times and on into the Early Middle Ages. The name ‚ÄúHettenrodt‚Äù, though, with the ending ‚Äîrodt (‚Äúclearing‚Äù), shows that the village arose at the time of the third Frankish settlement period. Professor Dr. Baldes writes in his local history of the Birkenfeld countryside: ‚ÄúIn 1262, Ritter (roughly ‚ÄúSir‚Äù) Wilhelm von Schwarzenberg had serfs there, because of whom he had disagreements with the Count of Sponheim, whose vassal he was.‚Äù Beginning in 1321, the village cropped up under the names Hettelrodt and Hettenrodt in feudal bonds of the Idarbann (a feudal domain), and shared fate with its outlying village, Idar. To this day, Hettenrodt‚Äôs mother church stands in Idar, and no other places in the old Idarbann show such conformity in their local speech as Idar and Hettenrodt. Even in the Middle Ages, Hettenrodt was already no longer purely a farming village. The areas that could be used for cropraising were small and with their sparse soil on slopes yielded less than ample harvests, especially for big families. Cloth and stocking making thus became prevailing livelihoods alongside agriculture among the villagers, until the important upswing brought by the gem-cutting industry in the Idar- Oberstein area in the 18th century. Since the Steinkaulenberg was right nearby, only a half hour‚Äôs walk from the village along a path, it could be that some tried their luck as quarrymen in the galleries there. Others built gem-cutting mills on the Idarbach. Chroniclers report that most mill owners whose mills were Am Katzenloch (a prepositional expression, but used as a proper name; it means ‚ÄúAt the Cat Hole‚Äù) were inhabitants of Hettenrodt. After the Second World War, Hettenrodt changed for the better. The gem industry was once again the basis of the local economy, as well as full employment in all other fields of business. Ethnic Germans driven out of Germany's former eastern territories sought housing and work in Hettenrodt, too, as they did throughout Germany. This need for housing kept growing. In 1952, the municipality built a house in which four refugee families found shelter. In 1953, two Schwedensiedlungen (‚ÄúSweden settlements‚Äù; so-called because the wooden houses had been donated by the Swedish government) were built on the village's outskirts, and two refugee families who had been driven out of their land moved in. These two new centres and a third one built in 1960 took the meadows and fields forsaken by smallhold farmers and put them to work. The village's appearance changed quickly. Barn gates, which in the late 1940s were to be seen on almost every house, were replaced with garage doors; stables and barns became modern dwellings. Streets were tarred to handle the ever growing motorized traffic using them. Between 1965 and 1975, the whole village was provided with sewerage and street lighting was modernized. Several new building developments were opened (Birkenweg, Struthwiese, Karrenweg, Unter dem Karrenweg, Am Dicken Stein). Meanwhile, a few children's playgrounds were also laid out. Even the graveyard underwent an overhaul. Work began on a mortuary in 1969. The graveyard itself was expanded in 1973, and a belltower was added in 1980. In 1984, Hettenrodt became the first municipality in Rhineland-Palatinate to own its own grocery shop. After buying out the Keppler business in the village centre in 1972, the municipality had the house torn down in 1983, from whose rubble arose the shop. It was acquired by the municipality the following year. In 1965, the former village pond on the ‚ÄúKremel‚Äù was expanded into a swimming pool, and at the same time served as the fire pond. In the late 1980s, the complex was converted into a biotope. In 1974, some of the inhabitants expressed a wish for Hettenrodt to be amalgamated into the town of Idar-Oberstein, but this never came to pass. A pilot project in 1983 saw all 300 households in the village hooked up to cable television. Hettenrodt's population was then some 700. Since then it has risen to almost 800. German reunification in 1990 spurred the establishment of a partnership with a municipality in the former East Germany, Kleinneuhausen in Thuringia.Hettenrodt‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Hettenrodt's mayor is J√ºrgen Thom, and his deputies are Hans-G√ºnter M√ºller and Bernhard Koch.Hettenrodt‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per bend chequy gules and argent and vert a lime tree eradicated Or. =Town partnerships= Hettenrodt fosters partnerships with the following places:Hettenrodt‚Äôs partnership with Kleinneuhausen * Kleinneuhausen, S√∂mmerda, Thuringia References External links * Municipality‚Äôs official webpage Category:Birkenfeld (district) ","title":"Hettenrodt"},{"id":"11881711","text":"The diocese of ƒê√† N·∫µng () is a Roman Catholic diocese in central Vietnam.

The municipal area measures 4.68 km¬≤, of which 54.3% is wooded. The municipality's elevation is 338 m above sea level.Statistics for Hintertiefenbach History In 1338, Hintertiefenbach had its first documentary mention under the name Inredyfinenbach.

On 14 October 1560, the monastery sold the four villages to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim. The village's name changed over time from the original form to Heredifenbach, Niederdiffenbach, Unterdefenbach and Underdiffenbach. By 1776, the village belonged to the Margraviate of Baden, and in 1783, serfdom was abolished. Shortly thereafter came the French Revolutionary Wars and then Napoleonic times, when Hintertiefenbach was grouped into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Fischbach in the canton of Herrstein under French rule. After Napoleon's downfall, the Congress of Vienna assigned Hintertiefenbach to the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. In 1824, a school system was introduced in the four ‚Äúabbey municipalities‚Äù. In 1879, after the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Fischbach was dissolved, the village once again belonged to the Amt of Herrstein. A new school was built in 1880. In 1908, watermains were laid, and in 1913 came electricity. In the time of the Third Reich, after the Reich Law was enacted on 26 January 1937, Hintertiefenbach was transferred from Oldenburg (which then still existed as a territorial unit) to Prussia (which likewise still existed within Germany) with effect from 1 April 1937. On 19 March 1945, the village was occupied by the United States Army, although by July of the same year, they had yielded their authority to the French. Since 1946, Hintertiefenbach has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.Hintertiefenbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayors= Hintertiefenbach's mayor since 14 July 1999 has been Alexander Ebels, and his deputies are Gerd Conzelmann and Peter Brust.Hintertiefenbach‚Äôs council The mayoralty has since 1949 been held by the following persons: * 1949‚Äì1952 Albert Brust * 1952‚Äì1964 Paul Mayer * 1964‚Äì1965 Otto Bernhard * 1966‚Äì1969 Albert Brust * 1969‚Äì1979 Jakob Franzmann * 1979‚Äì1999 Ewald Brust * 1999‚Äì Alexander Ebels =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per bend sinister sable an ear of wheat bendwise sinister surmounted by a miner's lamp, both Or, and chequy gules and argent issuant from base an abbot's staff of the first.

Unearthed in the Vierherrenwald (‚ÄúFour-Lord Forest‚Äù) was a stone axe from the New Stone Age (about 3500‚Äì1800 BC). Most archaeological finds, though, come from Roman times. As the Hottenbach church was being torn down in 1903, Roman brickwork was discovered along with sandstone blocks and a hypocaust, which all point to a Roman villa rustica. On Langmes, not far from the old long-distance path from the Nahe to the Moselle, a burying ground with 60 to 70 cremation pits was found. At the municipal limit with Oberhosenbach once stood a small temple. Roman life is believed to have ended when the Germanic invaders came in AD 275 and 276. The village that stands now had its first documentary mention in 1181 under the name Hattinbach. The name itself comes from the personal name Hatto, which has been linked with the Hattonids, a comital house in Carolingian times whose influence stretched through the years 756 to 843. The seeds from which the village sprang were the two lordly estates down from and up from the church, which were held by the Hunsr√ºck noble family of Wiltberg, who also had at their disposal the local lordship and the church patronage. In the 14th century, a number of sales led to a change in fiefholders at the two estates to which lordly rights to the village were also attached. Hereafter, the village had four lords: the Archbishop of Trier, the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves, the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim and the Lords Cratz von Scharfenstein. After this last named noble house died out in its male line in 1718, the Electorate of Trier took over their share of the lordship. In the 18th century, many families emigrated from Hottenbach. Their destinations were the United States, West Prussia, East Prussia and later Galicia. Beginning in 1794, Hottenbach, along with the rest of the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, was occupied by the French. On 17 December 1795, during fighting between French and Austrian troops, the village was plundered. In 1800, the former Unterschulthei√üerei of Hottenbach was raised to seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) made up of not only Hottenbach but also Hellertshausen, Asbach, Weiden, Schauren, Bruchweiler, Kempfeld, Breitenthal, Wickenrodt and Oberhosenbach. After Hottenbach was transferred to Prussia as a result of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, it became part of the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Rhaunen in the newly formed Bernkastel district in the Regierungsbezirk of Trier. In 1867, Hottenbach's population figure peaked, at 917 inhabitants. However, the nearby Asbach Ironworks was shut down in 1872 and this led in the years that followed to migration to the Saarland and further emigration to the United States. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969 and 1970, Hottenbach passed along with the Verbandsgemeinde of Rhaunen to the Birkenfeld district. =Church= The parish of Hottenbach, to which the villages of Hellertshausen, Asbach and Weiden also belonged, had its first documentary mention in 1247. In the Middle Ages it belonged to the rural chapter of Kirn within the Bishopric of Mainz. The church patronage was first held by the family von Wiltberg, who in 1290 built a new parish church. On 21 October 1342, Volker von Wiltberg ceded his rights to the church to Archbishop of Trier Baldwin. At first, the right to name the parish priest seems to have alternated between the two estates. The Reformation came relatively late to Hottenbach because of the denominational rift in Hottenbach: the Electorate of Trier and the Lords Cratz von Scharfenstein clung to the old belief (Catholicism), the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves were Lutheran and the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim was Reformed. About 1600, there is known to have been a Lutheran pastor in the village. It also seems that in these years the church was renovated after a fire. About 1608, the Electorate of the Palatinate, over resistance from the other local lords, posted a Reformed preacher in the village. No later than 1621, though, Hottenbach was once again Lutheran. Twice during the Thirty Years' War there were attempts at a counterreformation: from 1625 to 1629 and from 1636 to 1640, Hottenbach had a Catholic pastor. In 1701, more pews were added to the church and the galleries were expanded. Furthermore, the church received an ornate pulpit and a Baroque church door with a porch. In French times, the parish of Hottenbach belonged to the Wirschweiler consistorial church. This was united in 1817 along with the Trarbach consistorial church with the Trier District Synod. When the Synod was deemed to have become too big, it was sundered in 1825, and the parishes in the Bernkastel and Trier districts then formed the Wolf District Synod, whose name became Trier District Synod in 1843, after the biggest place within its limits. The branch parish of Weiden was separated from Hottenbach in 1817 when the terms of the agreements made at the Congress of Vienna came into force, putting Weiden in the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. In 1819, the parishes of Hottenbach and Stipshausen were bound to each other. In 1903, the church's old nave, which had fallen into disrepair, was torn down, while the former quire tower from 1290 was left standing. On 1 August 1904, the new church building, designed by architect August Senz, was consecrated. The new central structure combined the traditional with the modern, incorporating many parts of the old building while also meeting Protestant requirements. =Jewish life= Historical records show that so-called Schutzjuden (‚ÄúProtected Jews‚Äù) had settled in the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate as early as the 14th century, which also explains the relatively high Jewish populations in some Hunsr√ºck villages. Before 1700, the Jews of the Amt of Wildenburg ‚Äì more than 20 families ‚Äì lived exclusively in Hottenbach. When the new, more liberal spirit set in under French rule, the Jews were given leave to build a synagogue with a mikveh. The place of worship was also used as a cheder. Moreover, there was a Jewish graveyard outside the village.Bericht und Bilder bei Alemannia- Judaica.de In 1808, there were 116 Jewish men, women and children living in Hottenbach, giving the village the biggest Jewish community in what is now the Birkenfeld district. In 1880, Hottenbach's Jewish population amounted to 17% of the village's inhabitants. Hottenbach and Stipshausen together formed a qahal. In 1875, the Jews of Bruchweiler, Sensweiler and Wirschweiler also belonged to the synagogical region, which was overseen by the Chief Rabbi of Trier. In the late 19th century, many of the Jews emigrated to the United States or joined the Idar-Oberstein jewellery industry. When the Jewish community was dissolved in 1932, sixteen Jews were still living in Hottenbach. On 3 March 1940, the village's last Jewish family fled the country for the United States. The memorial book Opfer der Verfolgung der Juden unter der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft in Deutschland 1933‚Äì1945 (‚ÄúVictims of the Persecution of Jews under the National Socialist Dictatorship in Germany‚Äù) in the German Federal Archives lists 16 names of Jewish citizens who either were born in Hottenbach (14) or lived there (2), and who were lost in the Holocaust.Gedenkbuch des Bundesarchives The former synagogue is today a privately owned house. The Jewish graveyard is administered and maintained by the municipality of Hottenbach. Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The 12 seats are shared between two voters‚Äô groups. The 2004 municipal election was by majority vote.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Hottenbach's mayor is Horst Kreischer, and his deputies are Rudi R√∂per and Brigitte R√∂per.Hottenbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess gules a stone argent with a figure representing Mercury of the same on a background sable, the whole surmounting a fess abased of the second, and Or issuant from base a lion rampant of the first armed and langued azure. The main charge in the upper field is a simplified depiction of a Roman Vierg√∂tterstein (‚Äúfour-god stone‚Äù) found in 1903 while the old church was being torn down. The silver fess (horizontal stripe) on the red field recalls the Sponheim and Electorate of Trier colours, a reference to two of the village's former lords. A third one is recalled by the composition in the lower field, namely the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. Together these three lordships formed the high court of Hottenbach-Hellertshausen. After these two villages were separated, the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves were left with the greatest share of Hottenbach.Description and explanation of Hottenbach‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Evangelical parish church, Hauptstra√üe ‚Äì former quire tower, possibly from the latter half of the 13th century, pyramid roof possibly from the 16th century; octagonal quarrystone building with tent roof, additions laid out in a cross shape, marked 1904, architect August Senz, D√ºsseldorf; porch about 1700; equipment from the former building; three bells: 13th century, 1595, 1628; Roman Vierg√∂tterstein (‚Äúfour-god stone‚Äù); characterizes village's appearance (see also below) * Ringstra√üe, at the graveyard ‚Äì warriors‚Äô memorial, pedestal with relief, soldier sculpture, 1920s by F.

Many archaeological finds substantiate this, foremost among which is the Vierg√∂tterstein (‚Äúfour-god stone‚Äù), whose four faces feature Juno, Minerva, Hercules and Mercury. Unique in the Hunsr√ºck are the Late Romanesque ceiling paintings with multiple Christian motifs, in the middle of which stands Jesus. They can be found in the Early Gothic vault of the east tower, and are an anonymous master's work. A further decorative element in the church is the organ, built in 1782 by the Stumm family of organ builders from neighbouring Sulzbach. Oberhof The most important secular building in Hottenbach is the Oberhof (‚ÄúUpper Estate‚Äù), built in 1792. In 1797, after the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank passed to France, it became the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù), to which eight villages belonged as of 1800. The now restored building is today under private ownership. Economy and infrastructure The village, which is characterized by agriculture, is with its gemstone and jewellery processing operations a good starting point for hikes into the nearer and farther surrounding area, which is rich in points of interest of all kinds. =Transport= Serving nearby Idar-Oberstein is a railway station, which as a Regional-Express and Regionalbahn stop, is linked by way of the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) to the Saarland and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. The Rhein-Nahe-Express running the Mainz-Saarbr√ºcken route serves the station hourly. Every other train goes through to the main railway station in Frankfurt with a stop at Frankfurt Airport. Formerly, fast trains on the Frankfurt-Paris route had a stop at Idar-Oberstein. To the north lie Bundesstra√üe 50 and Frankfurt-Hahn Airport.

The meaning of Nashaway is \\"river with a pebbled bottom\\".NIAC Publications ~ Nipmuc Place Names - Maine & Massachusetts The Nashua River in Groton, MA. The tribe took its name from this tributary of the Merrimack River.The Nashaway's principal settlement was Waushacum (possibly meaning \\"surface of the sea\\"), a parcel of land in what is now Sterling that was located between two ponds of the same name. The territory of the Nashaway was bounded downstream (to the north) on the Nashua River by the Pennacook, a powerful tribe with which numerous alliances were formed, to the east by tribes related to the Massachusett, to the south of the headwaters by Nipmuc bands and to the west by the Connecticut River where the Pocomtuc settled.Connole, Dennis A (2000), Indians of the Nipmuck Country in Southern New England, 1630-1750: An Historical Geography, McFarland Publishers. Sholan Farms, named after Chief Nashawhonan (Sholan), and located in Leominster, MA. It was one of the many Nashaway lands seized from the Indians to pay off their trading debts.The first reports of the peoples of Massachusetts' interior were scant. The sub-divisions had their own sachems and functioned independently of each other. Although they shared the similar L-dialect and other common customs, very little evidence is shown of any confederation except for the various skirmishes with English colonists that ultimately led to King Philip's War.Willard, Joseph (1853), \\"Address on the Commemoration of the Two Hundredth Anniversary of the Incorporation of Lancaster, Massachusetts\\", Bibliolife, LLC. The bands made alliances and were possibly confederated with the Pennacook. The tribes of the interior posed a problem for John Eliot, as the tribes were too far to visit and the area was still very much a frontier region. At the time of the first visits by John Prescott, the minister appointed to the tribe by the colony, power had been passed from Sachem Nashawhonan (Sholan) to Nanomocomuck (Monoco), a Pennacook chieftain descended from Passaconaway. Court records indicate that this sachem was charged for debts incurred for goods bought on credit and the high prices charged to them for the colonists' goods. This ultimately led to the loss of land and tensions that resulted in King Philip's War. The fate of the Nashaway is not known. The remnants of the tribe fled the area and merged with other tribes, such as the Pennacook or the Nipmuc proper, intermarrying. The Nashaway tribe is now extinct, although their descendants live among the Native Americans. Many of the Nashaway died while exiled on Deer Island in Boston Harbor.Connole, Dennis A. (2000) Their descendants can be found among the Abenaki of New England and Canada or the Schaghticoke. Legacy The Nashaway have left their imprint in many hydronyms and topographical features, such as the Sholan area of Leominster, the city and river known by \\"Nashua\\", and Mount Wachusett. During King Philip's War, the Nashaway sachem (chief) Monoco kidnapped a Lancaster villager, Mary Rowlandson. She later wrote a best-selling narrative about her captivity, forced journey from Lancaster northwest to the Connecticut river, and eventual release at Redemption Rock in present day Sterling, Massachusetts. It was of the genre called captivity narratives. Often writers would refer to their spiritual journey prompted by the captivity experiences.Bourne, Russell (1990), The Red King's Rebellion: Racial Politics in New England, 1675-1678, Atheneum Publishers, pg 163 ff.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the Deutsche Edelsteinstra√üe (‚ÄúGerman Gem Road‚Äù) in the southern Hunsr√ºck between the Idar Forest in the north and the town of Idar-Oberstein in the south. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Kempfeld are the hamlet of Katzenloch and the outlying homesteads of Auf dem Steinberg, Herrenflur and Wildenburg.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 20 (PDF) Village‚Äôs name Kempfeld was originally settled by a man named Campo. On the other hand, other researchers derive the name from the Latin campus, meaning field (and since Feld means the same, the name would therefore mean ‚ÄúField Field‚Äù). This hypothesis is, however, contradicted by the dialectal name ‚ÄúK√§felt‚Äù and the mediaeval name cempinvelt from 1319.Kempfeld‚Äôs name History In a copy of the Liber Aureus (St. Maximin's Abbey's ‚ÄúGolden Book‚Äù), which came into being about 1200, Kempfeld had its first documentary mention. Matched by the extensive network of paths was relatively heavy settlement in individual homesteads, which belonged mostly to local people, but in almost every municipality in the Kempfeld area, traces of habitation from Roman times (roughly 50 BC to AD 375) can be found. The Romans built their houses from stone, put their dead in stone chests and built memorials to them, and monuments to their gods, out of stone. In 1901, one of these cist graves was unearthed 500 m south of the village on the way to Katzenloch. This, however, yielded no further knowledge. About 950, the Emichones sat as the Graugrafen (‚ÄúGau Counts‚Äù) in the Nahegau. They were related to the Salian Imperial house. In the 11th century, they already held the Gau in hereditary ownership, and also, they were naming themselves after castles: in 1107 the Counts of Schmidtburg, in 1098 the Counts of Flonheim, in 1128 the Counts of Kyrburg and in 1103 Comites silvestres, later the Waldgraves (or Wildgrafen in German). Towards the late 12th century, three lines of the Emichones had arisen as two new ones split away from the main one: the Counts of Veldenz in 1129 and the Raugraves in 1140. In 1263, the Waldgraviate was partitioned, with the Schmidtburg and Kyrburg going to Emich, and Dhaun and Grumbach to Gottfried. The so-called Landgraviate, however, remained undivided and in common ownership. Only nineteen years later, in 1282, came another partition between members of the house's main line: Konrad kept Schmidtburg while Gottfried got Kyrburg and the paternal rights to Bruchweiler, Kempfeld, Breitenthal and Oberhosenbach. High jurisdiction and woodlands remained commonly held. In 1319, the communal high jurisdiction over Raide (Veitsrodt), Horbure (Herborn), Bruchwilre (Bruchweiler), Schuren (Schauren), Kempvelt (Kempfeld), Huisinbach (Niederhosenbach), Breidendail (Breitenthal) and three villages that have since vanished, Dudinsbach (Diedesbach), Vockinhusen (Fuckenhausen) and Dyfenbach, was documented. In 1330, the last count of the Schmidtburg line died. He had been in a longstanding feud with his cousin Friedrich von der Kyrburg. So that Friedrich could not get the inheritance to which he was entitled by lawful, written documents, the late count had arranged for Archbishop of Trier Baldwin to be enfeoffed with the Schmidtburg (castle) and its appurtenances, and also Bundenbach. In 1328, Friedrich had built a castle of his own, the Wildenburg, but by 1330 he was forced to enfeoff Archbishop Baldwin with this. Kempfeld formed together with Veitsrodt in the Middle Ages a lordship of St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. A letter of enfeoffment from 1483 for the Waldgraves of Dhaun still exists. Within Kempfeld's municipal limits lie two sites on which once stood now vanished villages. Schalwen, or Schalben, lay below the road leading to Wildenburg and Katzenloch. On the other side of this road once lay the execution place, where the gallows could be set up as needed. After the 1574 boundary-defining Grenzweistum (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), not only Kempfeld's municipal area along with the Wildenburg belonged to the High Court of Wildenburg, but so did Asbach, Herborn, Veitsrodt, the woods of Wenzel and Vitsruth, the now vanished village of Fuckenhausen and part of Kirschweiler. The local hangman, who was also a knacker, lived outside the village of Schalben. The hangman played a role in the people's lives and thoughts. As a knacker he handled, among other things, hides, skins and leather. Both trades were regarded as dishonest, and their practitioners as unclean, hence the reason for his living outside the village rather than in it. He also had to set up his sales stall at markets apart from the rest. The other vanished village within Kempfeld's municipal limits was Baalsbach, or Badelsbach. Bearing witness to this place is a cadastral name ‚ÄúAuf Baalsbach‚Äù. A report from the time after the Thirty Years' War about Kempfeld mentions both Schalwen and Baal√üpach, but by that time, they had both already been forsaken, and their lands conceded to Kempfeld. At that time, though, there were still remnants to be seen of both villages. Even as early as 1514, a Weistum had described Baalsbach as vergangen (‚Äúpast‚Äù or ‚Äúbygone‚Äù), meaning that it was no longer there. The last Amtmann of the Wildenburg, Johann Karl Ruppenthal (1767‚Äì1798), managed to get himself into the villagers‚Äô bad books. As Ruppenthal rode through the village late one evening with his riflemen, the night watchman apparently blew the wrong signal on his horn. As punishment, the watchman was made to practise the right signal the whole night long, which almost drove the Kempfelders to uncontainable fury. They complained about this inconsiderate disturbance of their usual nighttime quiet at once in Kirn, but nothing was done about Ruppenthal's behaviour. Another time, the Amtmann happened upon the Kempfelders as they were arguing with a tithe official. Ruppenthal flew into such a rage over the peasants‚Äô supposed stubbornness that without further ado he had his riflemen lock them all up in the church. This, however, only angered the imprisoned men's wives and, arming themselves with brooms and threshing flails, they then drove Ruppenthal out of the village. This scene is still remembered today by a fountain at the square on Allenberger Weg. In 1529, a church was built in Kempfeld, which was renovated in the 18th century. On 25 August 1911, the church was utterly destroyed in a great fire in which the bells also melted. The plan for reconstructing the church was delivered by the Mayor of Cologne at that time, Senz, who had also headed reconstruction efforts for the church in Hottenbach in 1903. The whole village was stricken by the fire. It broke out in the afternoon in the Stumm Brewery's stables. That summer's drought made the fire impossible to contain. Within half an hour, all houses and barns near the source of the fire were in flames. Besides the church, five houses, six barns, the brewery and one slaughterhouse were burnt down. The fire came almost exactly a century after another, similar great fire raged in the same place in August 1811. On 1 August 1914, after the First World War had broken out, 11 Landsturm personnel, 10 Landwehr men, 10 reservists from Kempfeld had to go to war, and 15 recruits from the village found themselves in training. Even by early August, four men from Kempfeld had fallen; by Christmas it was seven. On Sunday 17 October 1926, a memorial was dedicated at the village graveyard to the 21 who had fallen in the Great War. During the Second World War, too, Kempfeld suffered heavily, and many local men fell. Moreover, several bombs fell on the village, in which 200 evacuees had taken refuge. On 30 August 1975, yet another great fire struck Kempfeld, destroying, once again, the church, and also three houses. It broke out in a small house on Hauptstra√üe towards 10:45. Despite a large contingent from the fire brigade, the fire could not be stopped from spreading to the neighbouring house. A house once owned by a lordship and two, smaller servant's houses burnt right down. Most of the household belongings could be removed before the fire consumed the houses, but these were then kept ‚Äúsafe‚Äù in the church, as had been done during the 1911 fire. The householders then had to watch helplessly as their chattels, too, went up in smoke along with the church when the fire reached it.Kempfeld‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Kempfeld's mayor is Wolfgang Wannemacher, and his deputies are Horst Albohr and Antje Louis.Kempfeld‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: In schr√§ggeteiltem Schild vorn in Gr√ºn ein goldener gezinnter Turm auf einem silbernen Dreiberg, hinten in Gold ein blaubewehrter und -gezungter roter L√∂we.

Krummenau is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Birkenfeld district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies in the Hunsr√ºck north of the 746 m-high Idarkopf in the Idar Forest. The municipal area is 61.6% wooded. The Idarbach flows through the village. =Neighbouring municipalities= Krummenau borders in the north on the municipality of Niederweiler, in the east on the municipality of Laufersweiler and in the west on the municipality of Horbruch. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Krummenau is the outlying homestead of Weylandsm√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 20 (PDF) History =First documentary mention= On 20 November 1086, Krummenau had its first documentary mention in a donation document From Archbishop Wezilo. A manuscript from the late 18th century ‚Äì kept at the archive of the Museum of Wasserburg-Anholt of the Prince of Salm- Salm in Isselburg-Anholt in Westphalia ‚Äì is the only record of this. The original was a donation document whereby Wezilo granted Saint Christopher's Church at Ravengiersburg an estate in the village of Lindenschied and also three mansos in Runa und Crummenauwe in pago Nachgowe (‚Äúoxgangs‚ÄúOxgangs‚Äù is used here as a rough translation of the German Hufen. in Rhaunen and Krummenau in the County of the Nahegau‚Äù). Such pious gestures to the church were not unusual in mediaeval Germany, but they did come with conditions. This particular donation, for instance, required the recipient to say a Mass each Friday for the donor's salvation and also to sing a Requiem for him when he died. There is some question as to whether the manuscript writer, J. G. F. Schott, falsified the document just so that he could earn money by selling it, but whatever happened in the 18th century, it is highly likely that Krummenau is older than 900 years anyway. =Roman times to the Middle Ages= The Romans could never feel altogether safe in the Hunsr√ºck in what they called Germania Superior. Beginning in the mid 4th century AD, Germanic peoples were thronging into the region. Before the Franks cut a swath of destruction along their path and took the land along the Moselle and on the Hunsr√ºck into their ownership about 475, Roman colonist families left the area and withdrew along with Roman troops. Only the higher areas of the Hunsr√ºck were left more or less untouched. A new settlement process began with farmsteads, clearings, village foundings and the division of the land into Gaue. Throughout the Middle Ages, the old Roman road and a ‚Äúgrey cross‚Äù at the crossing of this road with the path from Krummenau to Hirschfeld formed important reckoning points for the borders of the sovereign area to which Krummenau belonged. ‚ÄúAus dem kroen Kruytz in die Steynstra√ü immer dann die Steynstra√ü hin‚Äù reads one of many border descriptions from 1509 (‚ÄúFrom the grey cross onto the Stone Road and then always down the Stone Road‚Äù). Furthermore, a 1508 Weistum likewise mentions the ‚Äúgrey cross‚Äù as part of a border description (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times). Even as late as 1711, a map marked a cross on the old Roman road at that spot, even though protocols from as early as 1461 had noted that it had long ceased to be there. There was, however, a ‚Äúgrey stone‚Äù. Krummenau belonged to the High Court Region of Rhaunen, within which the Waldgraves of Schmidtburg, later those of Dhaun, sat as the lords of the high court, which as a high court had the power to hand down death sentences. On 29 September 1399, Johann and Friedrich, Waldgraves at Dhaun, enfeoffed Count Palatine Ruprecht (who the very next year became Rupert, King of Germany) with the court and people at Krummenau, for which they received a charter of protection for this and other villages. In 1461 and 1469, the Waldgraves of Dhaun and Kyrburg were mentioned as lords of the high court. In 1493, 1508 and 1558 it was the Waldgraves of Dhaun. The court passed in 1633 to the Dhauns, who had now become the Rhinegraves of Dhaun. Beginning in 1789, sovereign rights passed to the Princes of Salm-Salm. In each case, the villagers were under serfdom. =French Revolutionary and Napoleonic times= Immediately affected by the French Revolutionary Wars in the late 18th century was the Hunsr√ºck. Great havoc was wrought as French, Prussian and Austrian troops marched on through, taking their toll by demanding supplies and by encamping. The winter of 1794‚Äì1795 must have been hard for the local people as well as for the French soldiers, many of whom were ill. The French did not stay long in any one place, not even in the winter, preferring to move elsewhere in search of supplies once they had depleted those nearby. The local schoolteacher in Krummenau, Korb, recorded plundering in the village by French soldiers. The French swept the old feudal order away and the nobility was stripped of its powers and its holdings. Serfdom was abolished. A new administrative order was set up on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank after the French Revolutionary model. Krummenau now belonged to the Department of Sarre, the arrondissement of Birkenfeld, the canton of Rhaunen and the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Rhaunen. In 1801, with the Treaty of Lun√©ville, the Rhineland officially became French territory and all French laws came into force. The Code civil des Fran√ßais was introduced in 1804. =Prussian times= French rule was brought to an end in 1814 with the victory over Napoleon. At the Congress of Vienna the following year, the Rhineland was awarded to Prussia. Krummenau found itself in the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Rhaunen in the Bernkastel district, which in turn was in the Regierungsbezirk of Trier. In Prussian times, the village's population began to swell, until it reached a point that was not sustainable. This forced some of the poorer people to take the risk of emigrating. From 1846 to 1851, nobody emigrated, at least not with official approval. Thereafter, however, history mentions 13 emigrants from that time. =Imperial Germany= In the last third of the 19th century, a few people from Krummenau moved to the industrial areas that had arisen by then, and the population began to shrink. In this time, Krummenau was rather literally off the beaten track. No road led through the village. The Rhaunen- Weitersbach-Horbruch sealed road ran by the village through the ‚ÄúCrummer-Wald‚Äù (forest), not through the village. Nevertheless, the villagers were expected to pay for the upkeep of the stretch near the village. There were dirt paths leading to nearby villages such as Wahlenau, Niederweiler and Laufersweiler, but they were only passable by freight cart. There was also only one bridge across the Idarbach/Altbach in the village centre, built of stone and dating most likely from 1806. Another bridge was eventually built in 1912. The schoolhouse was dedicated in 1913. The Bernkastel district was lucky enough to see work on its electrical supply begun at just the right time; it was far enough along before the outbreak of the First World War for there to be no need to suspend work. By 1915, it was working. The neighbouring Simmern district, on the other hand, saw all preparations for such a project stop for the duration. The Mobilization Order on 1 August 1914 shook Krummenau badly, for nobody had seriously expected a war. The quiet village was thereafter affected more and more by the war. The problem of supplying food for the war effort had already been foreseen at the outbreak of the war, but it was not until 1915 that a system was introduced for this purpose. From one year to the next, Krummenau had to contribute ever greater amounts of grain and potatoes, as well as vegetables, straw, hay, oil-bearing crops, butter and eggs. It did not help matters that so many men were called into the forces to fight for the Kaiser; the bulk of the work thus fell to women, children and the elderly. Schools gave schoolchildren time off classes to help with the work (indeed, in 1915 school was out for 7¬Ω months after the schoolteacher was conscripted). The workload was eased somewhat by help from Russian and later also French and British prisoners of war, who were housed at the old schoolhouse, and guarded by a man from Horbruch. One of the Russians escaped. There were 10 prisoners of war in Krummenau in 1918. That same year, the Kaiser was overthrown, the monarchy was abolished and the Great War came to an end with Germany's defeat. Four times Krummenau had to put up with German soldiers lodging in the village on their way home from the front. The village was choked with people, horses and carriages. The soldiers made themselves at home anywhere: on farms, in barns, in stables, in meadows. Only the odd Frenchman and American showed up in the village looking for food. Krummenau lost four men in the war; they were either killed or missing in action. =Weimar Germany= A new republican constitution brought Germany democracy, and the first election for the National Assembly on 19 January 1919 drew great interest in Krummenau. Sixty- nine votes were counted in the village: 44 for the Democrats, 11 for the Socialists and 14 for the Centrists. The French occupied the Rhineland, and thereby the Hunsr√ºck too, until 1930. They took a particularly heavy toll on the Hunsr√ºck by felling an extraordinarily great number of trees. This was part of the war reparations imposed on Germany. In 1932 and 1933, there was a great roadbuilding project in Krummenau together with water supply and sewerage projects. The district road was built through the village at last, changing the village centre forever. The old bakehouse had to be torn down to make way for the road. By 1929, the political situation in Germany had become ominous. The National Socialists under their leader Adolf Hitler were gaining in popularity, and this would soon usher in a new era. =Nazi Germany= The National Socialist movement reached the Hunsr√ºck rather later than it did other parts of Germany, namely about 1930. It appealed mainly to younger people. By 1932, a great deal of the Hunsr√ºck's inhabitants had chosen the Nazis as their party. With Hitler's seizure of power in 1933, terror was legalized and racism became a political principle. In Krummenau, unlike in many Hunsr√ºck villages, the mayor, Adolf Zirfa√ü, was allowed to remain in office, while his peers elsewhere were removed by decree and replaced with mayors who were more receptive to the Nazis‚Äô way of doing things. He held the office until 1945. The nearest Party Ortsgruppe, to which Krummenau belonged, was in Horbruch. There was no open opposition to the Nazi r√©gime in Krummenau. A few villagers were brave enough to continue business with Jews, as they had always done, even after the Nazis forbade it. It was also during the Third Reich ‚Äì in 1935 ‚Äì that Flurbereinigung was begun. This was, however, interrupted when the Second World War broke out. Once again, prisoners of war were detailed to work in Krummenau. They were French, and were housed at the old rectory in Horbruch and were guarded by a man from that village. They were to be kept away from the locals, and were forbidden even to eat at the same table. Shortly after war broke out, the schoolroom was seized by the military authorities. Schooling was for a while held at a private house. School had been reduced to three days each week by 1941 because the teacher had to fill in for another in Weitersbach. School was reduced even further once the teacher himself was called upon for military service. It was irregular until 1946; for a while, children attended school in Horbruch. Beginning in 1944, the Hunsr√ºck was subject to air raids. In March 1945, the Idar Forest was carpet-bombed by the Allies, with about 200 to 300 bombs falling within Krummenau's limits, mainly in the woods, damaging 10 to 12 hectares of forest. It is to this day a puzzle as to why this was done, for there were no military facilities in this part of the Idar Forest at this time. There may have been a link with the munitions offloading railway depot at Hochscheid, whose very existence may have led to the supposition that there was a munitions storage facility in the Idar Forest. There were five forestry workers in the danger zone at the time of the bombing, but nobody was wounded. As Germany's looming defeat in the war became ever more obvious, enthusiasm for the Nazi r√©gime sank ever deeper. The Volkssturm was organized in March 1945 as a last-ditch effort, and two tank traps were built in Krummenau, but on the night of 16 March, German troops retreated through the village on their way to Rhaunen and the river Nahe. Soon thereafter, on the morning of 17 March, the Americans marched in from Trarbach and Wahlenau, but did not stay, moving onwards. There was luckily no fighting in the village, as there was in Schlierschied. For Krummenau, the war was over. Six men from Krummenau had fallen or gone missing. =Allied occupation= Krummenau was occupied by United States forces. Adolf Zirfa√ü asked to be released from his mayoral duties in early April 1945, but was not replaced until August, when Otto Bonn was made commissary mayor. By this time, French forces had relieved the Americans of their occupational duties about a month earlier. In 1946, Krummenau became part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It was grouped into the Amt of Rhaunen, the district of Bernkastel and the Regierungsbezirk of Trier. Democracy was reintroduced after 12 years of Nazi dictatorship, but participation at the first elections for the Bundestag was very low. It took a long while before all the German prisoners of war came home. One local man, Heinrich Bartenbach, did not get home until October 1949. Also arriving in Krummenau, as elsewhere in Germany, were refugees. The population had risen from 118 in 1948 to 129 in 1950. Town and city dwellers also came into the countryside seeking food. =Recent times= Beginning in the mid-1950s, the villagers‚Äô economic situation improved generally, and the village's economic structure underwent a shift. Older buildings were modernized inside and out. Widespread rental accommodation leased by the Americans stationed here also brought such modern conveniences as sanitary facilities, electric cooking appliances and so forth. One loss for Krummenau was the old, stately Kroll house, a timber-frame house that had been the only one in the village with a mansard roof. It was torn down in 1977. In 1958, there were 8 cars in Krummenau. Given the dearth of public transport in Krummenau, cars were viewed as a necessity, and through the years, their numbers rose. By 1984, there were 48. The rise in popularity of motoring spurred improvements to the local roads. Work on tarring roadways to neighbouring villages, however, was not finished until the late 1960s. In the wake of the Second World War, the Allied occupiers established many military facilities in the Hunsr√ºck, and Krummenau was affected by this process, too. The French built a munitions depot covering 127 ha of the Idar Forest, ten to twelve hectares of which lay within Krummenau's limits (the rest was in neighbouring Weitersbach). The depot was taken over in 1963/1964 by the Bundeswehr. The depot contributed to the local economy as an employer, and a few local civilians were employed there as watchmen. The depot has since been converted into a storage facility for military replacement parts. Military manoeuvres, which were common throughout rural areas in the Bonn Republic, were also undertaken in the woods near Krummenau, and in 1963, there was a nasty accident. Some children from Krummenau who were playing in the woods found some ordnance in the forest that had been left behind by soldiers and lit some of the powder that they had gathered together from it. Nine-year-old Berthold Weiskopf sustained burns to both his hands and his face. The valley road to Bernkastel was finally opened in 1972, after first being proposed in 1920. Its construction required some realignment of roadways through Krummenau. One stretch of road was straightened so that it no longer had two right angles in it, right near each other, and another stretch now goes through an underpass right in the village. The river also had to be channelled through a steel pipe (owing to a contingency that the planners had failed to foresee), and the old Bauernm√ºhle (‚ÄúFarmer‚Äôs Mill‚Äù) downstream from Krummenau had to be torn down to make way for the new road. The road's construction also involved blasting in several places. The road has been a double-edged sword for Krummenau. On the one hand, traffic through the village has increased, but on the other hand, it has also increased tourism, for the road is quite scenic and affords good views of the valley. Despite opposition expressed at a citizens‚Äô meeting in 1968 to having Krummenau transferred from the Bernkastel district to the Birkenfeld district, the state administrative reformers got their way and the whole Amt but for Lindenschied and Woppenroth was transferred to the Birkenfeld district in the Regierungsbezirk of Koblenz in 1970. The Amt administration in Rhaunen became a Verbandsgemeinde administration. A new building development was opened in Krummenau in 1983 called ‚ÄúIn der Spie√üwiese‚Äù.Krummenau‚Äôs history =Monastery= It is far from certain whether there was ever a monastery at Krummenau, but according to oral tradition, there was one called Saint Lawrence‚Äôs here once, which stood until the Reformation was introduced in 1555. It is furthermore said that it was a popular pilgrimage site. The people of Laufersweiler, according to this oral tradition, have now stolen this monastery and it is now in Laufersweiler.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the Leiselbach at the Idar Forest in the Hunsr√ºck. The municipal area is 65% wooded. =Neighbouring municipalities= Leisel borders in the northeast on the municipality of Siesbach, in the southeast on the municipality of Wilzenberg-Hu√üweiler and in the southwest on the municipality of Schwollen. History In 1180, Leisel had its first documentary mention as Lucei in a document dealing with legal relationships in the Archbishopric of Trier, under whose sovereignty Leisel lay at that time. In 1328, Archbishop of Trier Baldwin acknowledged the Sponheim lordship over the Birkenfelder Land (the country around Birkenfeld). The countercompony base (that is, with two rows of squares of alternating tinctures) in the municipality's coat of arms recalls this time, for the Counts of Sponheim bore arms that were chequy (completely covered with squares of alternating tinctures). With regard to administration, Leisel belonged to the Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) of Brombach. Together with other nearby places it formed a unified administrative region, both in ecclesiastical and secular matters. Together with the Pflege of Birkenfeld, this formed the Sponheim Amt of Birkenfeld, whose northeast border was for centuries the Siesbach. The Amt administrators had their seat at Birkenfeld Castle, while the municipalities themselves were each led by a Reihe-B√ºrgermeister (Reihe means ‚Äúrow‚Äù or ‚Äúseries‚Äù in German), who changed every year. Standing above them, mostly for several villages each, was a Gerichtssch√∂ffe (roughly ‚Äúlay jurist‚Äù) appointed by the Amtmann. In 1437, Lussel, as it was then known, found itself under a condominium, ruled by both the Margraves of Baden and the Dukes of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken of the House of Wittelsbach, who were the heirs to the Sponheims‚Äô holdings once that noble house had died out. In 1776, the two rulers chose to divide their joint holdings between themselves, and Leussel or Leischer passed to Baden. Only twenty years later, though, the political landscape changed drastically with the French Revolutionary Wars. France annexed the Rhine‚Äôs left bank in 1797. In 1801, Leisel became the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù), which persisted until 1840, well after the end of French rule. It comprised the villages of Siesbach, Leisel, Schwollen, Hattgenstein, Rinzenberg, Hambach, B√∂schweiler and Heupweiler. The political alignment changed once again with Napoleon's downfall and the Congress of Vienna, which grouped Leisel into the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, or rather Oldenburg's local exclave, the Principality of Birkenfeld; most of Oldenburg's territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. Oldenburg sovereignty is commemorated in the road name Peterstra√üe in the Leisel Forest. Grand Duke Peter had it built so that he did not have to travel through the Kingdom of Prussia, with whom he had ongoing border disputes, whenever he visited the Birkenfelder Land. Oldenburg still existed as a state even through Imperial and Weimar times, but Nazi Germany finally put an end to it in 1937 on the basis of the Greater Hamburg Act; the Birkenfeld exclave, along with Leisel, as it was now called, was incorporated into Prussia's Rhine Province. After the Second World War, Leisel became part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1980, it celebrated its 800th anniversary of first documentary mention.Leisel‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayors= Leisel's mayor since 2009 has been Wolfgang Sch√º√üler, and his deputies are Karl Heinz Bittig and Wolfgang Helm.Leisel‚Äôs council His predecessors since the Second World War have been: * 1945-1969: Emil Hey * 1969-1976: Walter Sch√º√üler * 1976-1988: Werner Jung * 1988-2004: Karl-Heinz Bittig * 2004-2009: Klaus Bohrer =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: √úber rot-silbern geschachtem Schildfu√ü in Gr√ºn ein silbernes Hirschgeweih mit Grind, darin eine goldene Krone.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= Leitzweiler lies near the state boundary with the Saarland, roughly 3 km southeast of Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach and 9 km west of Baumholder. The municipal area measures 3.02 km2, of which 30% is wooded. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Leitzweiler is the outlying homestead of Lindenhof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 18 (PDF) Municipality‚Äôs name Leitzweiler was founded in the 8th or 9th century by nobility. At that time, all the places ending in ‚Äîweiler were founded as a result of the growth in population. In Leitzweiler's case, the leading syllable would give a clue as to the founder's name. It was likely Leudoin, for this was a very common name in the Early Middle Ages. History In 1440, Leitzweiler belonged to the County of Veldenz, and the Counts of Dhaun held it as a fief. This time is recalled in Leitzweiler's civic coat of arms; the lion in the upper half of the escutcheon is drawn from the arms formerly borne by the Counts of Veldenz. Leitzweiler ‚Äì older forms of the name were Leide√üweiler, Leydesweiler or Laitzweiler ‚Äì was certainly very small at this time, not so much a village as a farm, and with few inhabitants. In 1444, the tiny centre passed by inheritance to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, and within this was assigned to the Oberamt of Lichtenberg. In 1533, the Lords of Oberstein were enfeoffed with Leitzweiler, along with Mettweiler, Fohren and Linden. A 1539 agreement between the Oberamt of Lichtenberg and the Lords of Oberstein set forth clearly that authority in civil, personal and practical matters lay with the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. The Lordship of Oberstein, however, did not hold with the arrangement very long, for it was out of force by 1559, and thereafter Leitzweiler was a fief held by the Lordship of Wertenstein. At first, the Lordship comprised Leitzweiler, Heimbach, Weiersbach, Namborn, Ellweiler and Bleiderdingen. Near the last-named place stood the Wertensteiner Schloss, the Lordship's seat. In 1570, Leitzweiler burnt down utterly, although by 1587, Laitsweiler der Hof (Hof means ‚Äúfarm‚Äù in German) once again boasted four houses. In 1620, a new agreement between Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and Wertenstein came into force. This one set forth that authority in civil, personal and practical matters lay with the Lordship of Wertenstein, but high jurisdiction was reserved to Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. Among other things dealt with in the agreement was the question of appearances at the weekly market in Baumholder by the villagers of Leitzweiler. These were compulsory, and failure to show up there on market day was punished, even if the villagers were bound to do compulsory labour in Wertenstein that same day. The new agreement rectified this, and after it came into force, failure to appear at Baumholder Market was no longer punishable, as long as a Wertenstein official could show a certificate indicating that there was compulsory labour to be done that day. The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) brought plundering, devastation and destruction to Leitzweiler and its surrounding area. In their wake came hunger and sickness and the resulting unending decimation of the population. In 1635, Leitzweiler and Heimbach burnt down utterly. According to one account, people from Leitzweiler fled to Castle Birkenfeld. It was 1664 before there were once again inhabitants in either Leitzweiler or Heimbach ‚Äì two each. The man in Leitzweiler, according to an oft-told story, was not even German, but rather a French soldier named Werle, and indeed, the first families listed in the Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach Family Book with the surname Werle were all in Leitzweiler. Since then, the name has spread, so that there is now hardly a village in the local area in which the name Werle is not amply represented. The new village that sprang up after the Thirty Years' War was built on Leitzweiler's current site, but the village had thereby shifted its location somewhat from where the old one had been. It is believed that the old Leitzweiler lay some 100 or 200 m nearer Heimbach. In 1667, Lorraine finally managed to gain control over the Lordship of Wertenstein, thus ending the centuries-long squabbles with Oberstein or Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. Under Lorraine, Leitzweiler was grouped into the Upper Amt of Schaumburg. The last Lord of Castle Wertenstein died in 1745. In the years that followed (1748 to 1754), his offspring sold the lordship to Tholey Abbey, which thus acquired the tithing rights. Moreover, the Abbey exercised low jurisdiction, while high jurisdiction, as had been so before, lay with the Duke of Lorraine. Appeals, therefore, had to be heard in Lorraine's capital, Nancy. In 1766, the last Duke of Lorraine died, and France came into the Duke's inheritance. Only a few years later, though, the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken brokered a deal with France whereby Zweibr√ºcken traded certain places in Alsace for the villages of Freisen, Heimbach, Weiersbach, Bleiderdingen and Leitzweiler. The Duke thereby managed to fill some of the territorial gaps in his holdings in 1783. In November 1792, three years after the French Revolution, French Revolutionary troops descended on the Leitzweiler area. The French burnt Leitzweiler down, but this might have been a case of ‚Äúmistaken identity‚Äù. It seems that the French soldiers were to have burnt Eitzweiler, another village a few kilometres away, today a constituent community of Freisen in the Saarland. To offset Leitzweiler's loss, Eitzweiler was ordered to deliver to Leitzweiler oakwood so that the mistakenly burnt village could rise from its ashes. This, however, was not what Leitzweiler got. Instead, the wood delivered to the village was ash, which was not as popular as oak, for house borers found it quite appetizing. With the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797, the Rhine‚Äôs left bank was ceded to France. All lordly holdings were seized by the state and French law was imposed. Leitzweiler was part of the Department of Sarre and in the canton of Birkenfeld. The French campaign went further, putting an end to the thousand-year-old Holy Roman Empire in 1806. It was only in 1813 that Napoleon actually suffered a decisive defeat in the Battle of Leipzig (‚Äúthe Battle of the Nations‚Äù), which sent the French army fleeing to Paris, with the Prussians right behind them all the way. The Rhine's left bank was thus freed of French rule, and by a treaty concluded in May 1814, it was placed under a joint Imperial-Royal Austrian and Royal Bavarian ‚ÄúState Administrative Commission‚Äù (Landesverwaltungskommission). Leitzweiler lay in the Birkenfeld district in the canton of Baumholder in the Amtsbezirk of Berschweiler. Representatives from Europe's powers gathered in 1814 and 1815 at the Congress of Vienna to decide the Continent's political shape in the post-Napoleonic era. In April 1815, great parts of the now leaderless lands out of which the French had been driven passed to Prussia. The newly formed cantons of Sankt Wendel, Grumbach and Baumholder ‚Äì within which lay Leitzweiler ‚Äì were, however, given by the concluding act of the Congress to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld as compensation for having helped the allies in the Napoleonic Wars. In September 1816, Saxe-Coburg took charge of its new territory with its 25,000 souls and area of 8.25 square miles. Beginning in 1819, this territory, which went by the name Principality of Lichtenberg, had its seat of government in Sankt Wendel. Meanwhile, Weiersbach, which lay (and still lies) to Leitzweiler's north, was, along with great parts of today's Birkenfeld district, assigned to the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. Leitzweiler thereby became a border village between these two principalities. In 1832, the Hambach Festival was held, attended by 20,000 people who demonstrated for freedom, democracy, and national unity. At the same time, riots broke out in Sankt Wendel, leading the Duke to decide to sell the Principality of Lichtenberg to Prussia. The agreed price was 2,100,000 Thaler, and thus, in 1834, Leitzweiler remained a border village, but now in Prussian territory, while the Weiersbach side was, as it had been before, the Principality of Birkenfeld in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. Prussia grouped the new acquisition as the Sankt Wendel district into the Regierungsbezirk of Trier. Even today, an old border stone stands as a reminder of this time. The great stone bears the letters ‚ÄúKP‚Äù (for K√∂nigreich Preu√üen ‚Äì ‚ÄúKingdom of Prussia‚Äù) on the Leitzweiler side, and ‚ÄúGO‚Äù (for Gro√üherzogtum Oldenburg ‚Äì ‚ÄúGrand Duchy of Oldenburg‚Äù) on the Weiersbach side. As a result of Germany's defeat in the First World War and the subsequent 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the Sankt Wendel district was split: 26 of the 94 municipalities within it were grouped into the Saar, a League of Nations mandate. Leitzweiler was excluded from this cession ‚Äì by a couple of kilometres ‚Äì and thenceforth formed along with the other 67 excluded municipalities the ‚ÄúRestkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder‚Äù, with the first syllable of Restkreis having the same meaning as in English, in the sense of ‚Äúleft over‚Äù. The ‚Äúleftover‚Äù district's seat was in Baumholder. Oldenburg and Prussia still existed in one form or another right through Imperial and Weimar times, but the Third Reich put an end to the former in 1937 by merging it with the latter. Together with the Restkreis, a new Prussian Birkenfeld district was established, to which Leitzweiler belongs to this day. Prussia itself was abolished as any kind of political entity after the Second World War with the onset of Allied occupation. Since 1946, Leitzweiler has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Ecclesiastically, Leitzweiler was long part of the Catholic parish of Bleiderdingen. Until 1932, Leitzweiler's dead were even buried in Bleiderdingen. Only then did Leitzweiler get its own graveyard. In 1947, the municipality was transferred from the parish of Bleiderdingen to the parish of R√ºckweiler. The inhabitants undertook a campaign to collect signatures, but to no avail. Many villagers registered their protest by attending church in Bleiderdingen; some even went to Heimbach.Leitzweiler‚Äôs history =Population development= The following table shows Leitzweiler's population figures for selected dates since 1609:Population figures for Leitzweiler { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"width:100px;\\" - style=\\"background:#eee; text- align:center;\\"  Year  Population - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1609  37 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1623  28 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1635‚Äì1663  0 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1664  2 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1816  93 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1819  105 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1843  111 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1861  118 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1871  153 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1895  130 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1926  153 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1950  180 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1958  174 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1961  166 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  1978  132 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1990  110 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  1992  124 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  2004  130 - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  present  ‚âà115 } Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Leitzweiler's mayor is Peter Ley.Leitzweiler‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess argent a demilion azure armed and langued gules, and azure a garb of rye Or.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies west of the river Nahe in the Hunsr√ºck. The municipal area is 64.6% wooded. To the southeast lies the town of Idar-Oberstein. History Mackenrodt has not always been the smallest municipality between the Idarbach and the Siesbach. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the village had more inhabitants than, for instance, Hettenrodt or Kirschweiler. Unearthed within Mackenrodt's limits have been a few archaeological finds from Treverian (the Treveri were a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived) and Roman times. However, this does not mean that today's village is as much as 2,000 years old. Beginning about AD 500, the old settlements in the area were forsaken owing to the throngs of warlike Germanic peoples who were flooding in from the east. Only relatively late did people ‚Äì as it happens, the Franks ‚Äì once again settle on the upper Nahe. Before anyone could settle, though, land had to be cleared. This can even be seen in placenames like Mackenrodt, Hettenrodt and Algenrodt. The ending ‚Äîrodt refers to clearing woodland (German still has a verb roden that means ‚Äúclear‚Äù in the sense of removing trees). The whole area was throughout the Middle Ages part of the local feudal territory known as the Idarbann, both politically and ecclesiastically. One of the first measures undertaken by these new settlers was the establishment of churches; the ones in Birkenfeld and Brombach (see Niederbrombach, Oberbrombach) were already being mentioned in documents dating from about 700. The old greater parish of Idar might originally have been co√´xtensive with the judicial region of the Idarbann. The execution place of this region was found at the point where Mackenrodt's, Algenrodt's and Idar's limits all met each other, a spot that even today in the official cadastral nomenclature still bears the name Galgenberg ‚Äì ‚ÄúGallows Mountain‚Äù. To the parish of Idar, the Reformation came quite early on, before 1544. No later than 1320 or 1321, the Idarbann belonged as a subfief to the Imperial Lordship of Oberstein. Mackenrodt had its first documentary mention in the enfeoffment document as a result. The village shared its fate with the rest of the Idarbann in a political and economic sense. Thus, Mackenrodt passed along with the rest of the Idarbann to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim in 1766, and then in 1771 to the Margraviate of Baden, and soon thereafter to the French Republic ‚Äì as of 1804 the Empire. In 1814, the area found itself under a joint Imperial-Royal Austrian and Royal Bavarian ‚ÄúState Administrative Commission‚Äù (Landesverwaltungskommission) before the Congress of Vienna awarded it to the Kingdom of Prussia, who in turn ceded it in 1817 to the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. In 1918, Oldenburg became a ‚Äúfree state‚Äù within Weimar Germany. The Third Reich finally merged Oldenburg with Prussia in 1937. Since 1948, Mackenrodt has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The discovery of agate at the old execution place, the Galgenberg, set the course for the whole region's economic development. Over the centuries, Idar ‚Äì now merged with Oberstein ‚Äì became a world centre of the gemstone industry. Mackenrodt farmers found extra work as stone miners and agate grinders, as well as, later, as goldsmiths, grinding machine operators and diamond grinders. Nevertheless, agriculture and livestock raising for feeding the population remained until the end of the 19th century the more important industry. In 1833, Mackenrodt was described as ‚Äúa village feeding itself by cropraising and livestock raising, lying one hour from Idar, with which it is parochially united.‚Äù At the time, the village had 178 inhabitants, 176 of whom were Evangelical, while the other two were Catholic. The municipal area measured 1,810 Morgen (490 ha). The village was made up of 27 private buildings and one schoolhouse. One hundred and fifty years later, there were about 100 buildings, among them a church, administered as a branch church of Idar, and a sport clubhouse, which was also used as a community centre. With 400 or so inhabitants, Mackenrodt is still well behind most of the other smaller communities around Idar-Oberstein's periphery. The marked growth seen in, for instance, G√∂ttschied, Kirschweiler or R√∂tsweiler- Nockenthal, where ample building development areas have attracted people from Idar-Oberstein who could not find property in their own town, simply is not replicated in Mackenrodt. Another factor that may explain the weak growth in Mackenrodt is the village's lack of a main road running through it. There are only six businesses in the village, all dealing with gemstones, but each one employs only one or two persons. Most people in Mackenrodt must commute to their jobs, mostly in Idar-Oberstein. This is easy enough for those with cars, but public transport links are bad, especially in the evening. Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Mackenrodt's mayor is Reiner Mildenberger, and his deputies are Klaus Gans and Gerd Nilius.Mackenrodt‚Äôs mayor and his deputies =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per bend chequy argent and gules, and vert a spade blade argent. Mackenrodt's arms are unusual in that they have a ‚Äúchequy‚Äù field whose tinctures begin in dexter chief with the metal rather than the colour. This, at least, is what can be seen in this article, at the municipality's own website and at the Verbandsgemeinde‚Äôs website.website showing arms with metal first While this arrangement is usual under English heraldic rules, it is rather unusual in German heraldry.

It was re-founded as a secular community on 6 December 1768 by Count Philipp Ferdinand of Limburg Stirum. History The Order of the Old Nobility was founded by the German king Henry VII, the first from the House of Luxembourg, upon his election in 1308. A hundred years later, his descendant Sigismund, then King od Hungary, established the Catholic Order of the Dragon. In the aftermath of his defeat against the invading Ottoman forces, he aimed at strengthening Christian and knightly virtues and appealed to Saint George for his protection. With Sigismund's death in 1437, the line of Luxembourg emperors became extinct. When in 1769 Count Philipp Ferdinand re-established the community as a dynastic order of the House of Limburg-Stirum, he also wished to honour the four emperors from the Luxembourg dynasty, namely Henry VII (reigned 1308‚Äì1313), Charles IV (1347‚Äì1378), Wenceslas (1378‚Äì1410), and Sigismund (1410‚Äì1437). Twelve commanderies with incomes of 500 gulden were attached to the Order. Knights and Commanders gave at their nomination, a substantial amount of money or a territory as commandery to the Order. They could still enjoy the revenues of such territories, but left it to the Order afterwards. In 1806 the Lordship of Stirum was mediatized and the counts lost their rule over their estates. The Order was re-organized in 18138, however, Ackermann in his guide, published in 1855, listed it as extinct. Similarly, Archbishop H.E. Cardinale, wrote, that the Order ceased to exist. An examination of the Dutch High Council of Nobility (Hoge Raad van Adel) in 1886 gave the result that the Order is extinct. During a 1926 convent in Hanover, the Order was again re- organized as the \\"Ancient Chivalric Order of Saint George called Order of the Four Roman Emperors\\", then under the governorate of the comital House of Stolberg and the princely House of Liechtenstein. It was relocated to Salzburg, Austria in 1935 after the Nazi seizure of power and finally dissolved during the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938. Refounded in 1951, it exists up to today and held annual meetings. Description of the Order Knight's Cross The Order has three grades: * Grand Cross * Commander * Knight (picture) The eight-pointed cross patt√©e (Maltese cross) is covered with white enamel and in the light blue medallion is a gold representation of St George on his horse, fighting a golden dragon. On the arms are written the letters \\"H-C-W-S\\" in gold, in honour of the four Luxembourg emperors. The ribbon is grey-blue with yellow borders. In J√∂rg Nimmerguts catalogue another model of Knight cross can be found with flames on the arms of the cross, an Imperial Crown and the letters \\"P-P-D-E\\". In the medallion is an angel with a child in the hand.

From March 2002 to December 2011 he was a member of garage rock band, The Vines. Craig Nicholls, who founded the group, realised while touring for the promotion of their debut album, Highly Evolved (July 2002), that they needed an additional guitarist. So Nicholls asked his longtime friend and schoolmate Griffiths to join. As a member of The Vines he appeared on four of their studio albums, Winning Days (March 2004), Vision Valley (April 2006), Melodia (July 2008) and Future Primitive (June 2011). During his tenure Griffiths provided guitars (acoustic, rhythm or lead), keyboards, percussion and backing vocals before leaving, along with their drummer, Hamish Rosser, in December 2011. Biography Ryan Griffiths was born on 14 February 1978 and grew up in Sydney. Griffiths and Craig Nicholls (founder of garage rock band, The Vines in 1994) attended the same school. Nicholls later remembered attending his first concert with Griffiths, \\"I went with Ryan [to see The Screaming Jets] and I remember we were pretty young and I couldn't really see much because I was small and we were near the back\\". By March 2002 Nicholls had asked Griffiths to join The Vines, to tour and promote their debut album, Highly Evolved, which had been recorded by February. Alongside Griffiths and Nicholls, The Vines line-up was Patrick Matthews on bass guitar and Hamish Rosser on drums. Initially Griffiths played acoustic guitar, eventually he provided rhythm guitar, lead guitar, keyboards, percussion and backing vocals. As a member of The Vines he appeared on their studio albums, Winning Days (March 2004), Vision Valley (April 2006), Melodia (July 2008) and Future Primitive (June 2011). When playing on stage, Griffiths prefers his instruments mixed at lower levels. In 2005, as The Vines prepared for their third album, Vision Valley, Rosser indicated that he had written tracks with Griffiths but \\"it's likely only Craig Nicholls's work will show up on the new album\\". Griffiths co-wrote \\"Gimme Love\\" with Nicholls and Rosser, which appeared on their fifth studio album, Future Primitive and was issued as its lead single in mid-2011. The track was also used for the feature film, The Inbetweeners Movie (2011). In May 2011, Griffiths reflected on working in The Vines, \\"we were always a pretty tight unit, you know? We‚Äôre all good mates and we play music together really well. There was never any sort of point where we found it difficult to continue making music. It was just something that we all did so naturally together\\". In December that year The Vines appeared at the Homebake music festival without Griffiths or Rosser. In March 2012 Rosser joined heavy rockers, Wolfmother, while Griffiths contemplated a solo career. =Solo work= According to The Vines official fan club, from 2007, Ryan Griffiths wrote songs intending to release a solo album. Tracks that were written had influences from The Dandy Warhols, Brian Jonestown Massacre and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. As of yet, no solo material has surfaced. Ryan Griffiths is currently planning a tour through Europe, playing a solo acoustic set at smaller venues and festivals in summer 2014. Concerts in Australia have not been confirmed yet.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on a bend in a dale on the road between Birkenfeld and Idar-Oberstein. Indeed, four dales meet at Niederbrombach, one each coming from north, south, east and west. Also coming down three of those dales are streams, the Hambach, the Schwollbach and the Rothenbach. All three flow together at the hollow formed by the junction of the four dales and thereafter flow as one stream, called the Schwollbach, down to Kronweiler, where the Schwollbach empties into the river Nahe. Set above the dales are some peaks. North of Niederbrombach are the H√∂melskopf and the Heidkopf, to the east are the Pferdsh√∂he and the Brombacher H√∂he, to the south are the Rothenbachberg, the Winnenberg and the Hochkastell and finally, to the west are the Kleb and the Bauterskopf. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Niederbrombach are the outlying homesteads of Fischerhof, Haus Manzenbach, L√§rchenhof and Robinienhof.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 19 (PDF) History The oldest forms of the village's name found in documents are Brambach and Branbach. Only in more recent times has Niederbrombach been distinguished from Oberbrombach. Branbach, along with its subjects and its church, passed from Duke-Archbishop Liutwin's ownership to Saint Paulinus's Foundation in Trier about 700. Almost three centuries later, in 981, it passed to the Archiepiscopal Foundation of Trier. Brombach was the main centre of the Electoral-Trier holdings (later Sponheim holdings) south of the Idar Forest, and within the high court region and the Amtsbezirk, Brombach had become and remained the main centre of its own feudal domain (Gro√übann), its own Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) and its own parish. Secular and ecclesiastical holdings matched one another so fully that in the 18th century, the term ‚Äúparish‚Äù was also used to designate the administrative region. As the Middle Ages wore on, the Gro√übann underwent increasing disintegration due to continuing settlement. First, in the Early Middle Ages, came a partition into two, which was then followed much later ‚Äì in the 18th century ‚Äì by an ecclesiastical partition along the same lines. Under French rule from 1797 to 1814, the former ‚Äúadministrative parish‚Äù became a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù). From 1815 to 1817, the Brombach Pflege was Prussian, from 1817 to 1937 part of Oldenburg, and for the rest of the Third Reich's time in power, Prussian again. This ended with the onset of Allied occupation after the Second World War. Since 1946, Niederbrombach has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.Niederbrombach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2014, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Niederbrombach's mayor is Bernd Brombacher, and his deputies are Christoph Ruppenthal and Volker R√∂hrig.Niederbrombach‚Äôs mayor and his deputies =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Unter rot-silbern geschachtem Schildhaupt in Gold zwei rundbogige schwarze Arkaden.

The arches represent the village's old parish church. This was donated by Archbishop Liutwin of Trier to Saint Paulinus's Foundation in Trier, which quite likely founded the church.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the Hambach in the Hunsr√ºck, roughly 6 km northeast of Birkenfeld. =Constituent communities= Niederhambach's Ortsteile are B√∂schweiler, Burbach and Heupweiler. The municipality also includes an outlying centre known as the Burbacher Siedlung. This is three farms established in 1936. History In the Heupweiler cadastral areas known as ‚ÄúGeiersh√ºbel‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeiligenh√ºbel‚Äù, archaeological finds from pre-Roman times have been made. In another area, the ‚ÄúBeel‚Äù, two sandstone lions from a Roman tomb were unearthed. They can now be found at the Birkenfeld Museum. On the path over the B√∂schweiler H√∂he (heights) on the way to Wilzenberg, bronze rings from about 1000-500 BC were found in two barrows. Standing in B√∂schweiler was a complex known as the Widdemhof, which belonged to the Brombach priest. It was made up of two buildings. Before the Reformation, the estate had to make payments to the priest. The local lore has it that the Widdemhof was once a monastery. Whether this is true or not, the Widdem, as it is called, is under church ownership to this day. In 1338, Burbach had its first documentary mention. Count Johann III of Sponheim enfeoffed Prince- Archbishop-Elector Baldwin of Trier with his holdings at Burbach, whereupon he accepted from Baldwin the whole village as a fief. Johann III was the audacious Countess Lauretta's son. In the 14th century, the Oberstein church owned a farm within Burbach's limits. B√∂schweiler's first documentary mention came in 1438. The Salingshof was built by Lord Saling from Oberstein after he had earned money from building the Nahe Valley Railway and had bought land from what was then the self-administering municipality of Burbach. Lord Saling later sold this estate to Lord Scherer from Br√ºcken who, having just come back from the United States, was used to a life of solitude. The family later gave this up and moved to Rimsberg. Downstream from Burbach, on the Hambach's left bank, once lay a village called Klaffweiler, which is believed to have been devoid of any inhabitants by 1438. Its land was divided between Burbach and Brombach. At the turn of the 20th century, a bark mill stood downstream from Heupweiler, while in B√∂schweiler, a thriving tannery supplied the local farmers with sole leather. The current municipality of Niederhambach came into being on 1 October 1933 through the merger of B√∂schweiler and Heupweiler. This was a result of a bill passed by the Free State of Oldenburg for the purpose of simplifying administration. Flurbereinigung began even before Oldenburg was merged with Prussia in 1937, but the new Prussian administration delayed the project, and then the outbreak of the Second World War brought the whole endeavour to an end, at least for a while. The project was finally completed in 1955. A steady rise in the number of workers moving into other sectors of the economy, however, has led to a shift in Niederhambach's economy away from agriculture. In 2000, a new building area was opened up in B√∂schweiler, and nine new houses have been built there. Niederhambach participates in the project Unser Dorf hat Zukunft (‚ÄúOur village has a future‚Äù), and has placed first in the main class. Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"   SPD  CDU  WG 1  WG 2  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  2  2  2  2  8 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  1  3  2  2  8 seats } =Mayor= Niederhambach's mayor is Peter Schwarzbach. =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Unter rot-silbern geschachteltem Schildhaupt in gr√ºn die Darstellung der goldenen Skulptur eines links schauenden L√∂wen, der einen Widderkopf zwischen den Vorderpranken h√§lt. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Vert an image of the sculpture of a lion, the head turned to sinister and a ram's head between his forepaws, all Or, the chief countercompony gules and argent. The chief is a reference to the villages‚Äô former allegiance to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim, which bore arms chequy gules and argent. B√∂schweiler, Burbach and Heupweiler were in the Sponheim Oberamt of Birkenfeld. The field tincture, vert (green), stands for the agriculture in the municipality. The charge on the green field refers to two such sandstone sculptures unearthed within the municipality's limits on the ‚ÄúBeel‚Äù. The arms have been borne since 1965. =Town partnerships= Niederhambach fosters partnerships with the following places: * Bulgn√©ville, Vosges, France, a commune in Lorraine Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district B√∂schweiler * Am Kissel 3 ‚Äì so-called ‚ÄúKloster‚Äù (‚ÄúMonastery‚Äù); house, window walling possibly from about 1600, roof frame 1725, commercial building less old * M√ºhlenweg 1 ‚Äì so-called Fettigsm√ºhle; Baroque Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), about 1800; technical equipment Burbach * At Hauptstra√üe 7 ‚Äì elaborate portal, marked 1767 Heupweiler * At Hochwaldstra√üe 1 ‚Äì door lintel with inscription, 18th century * Hochwaldstra√üe 8 ‚Äì former Schneidersfranzenm√ºhle; former gristmill with three-floor mill tower, essentially possibly from the 18th century (timber framing dendrochronologically dated to 1725) Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Running east of the municipality is Bundesstra√üe 41, which towards the south leads to the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier). Serving nearby Kronweiler is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). =Economy= In recent years there has been a considerable shift in the municipality‚Äôs economic structure. Many agricultural businesses have simply been forsaken because they did not have the financial wherewithal to modernize and expand. Furthermore, agriculture is not attracting much new blood. It would seem that few young people nowadays want to become farmers. Most workers today commute to jobs in nearby towns and villages. =Public institutions= In Niederhambach, an important part of the community is the fire brigade. The Freiwillige Feuerwehr Niederhambach (‚ÄúNiederhambach Volunteer Fire Brigade‚Äù) was founded in January 1966 out of the compulsory fire brigade that had hitherto existed. The Volunteer Fire Brigade‚Äôs thirtieth anniversary was celebrated from 4 to 7 July 1997 in conjunction with the Fire Brigade Day held in the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld. The fire brigade also has a promotional association, which actively supports the firefighters. =Education= Niederhambach schoolchildren attend the Birkenfeld/Niederbrombach Regional School, the Realschule in Idar-Oberstein or the modern-languages Gymnasium in Birkenfeld. The local kindergarten is in Niederbrombach, and offers all-day care. =Established businesses= Among the crafts and skilled occupations in Niederhambach are a roofing business, an automotive workshop, a below-ground construction firm, a tile-laying business, a goldsmith's workshop, an automotive parts and repair shop, a game speciality and beekeeping business, an energy system and solar technology business and a health food store. There are two inns in Niederhambach. The number of agricultural operations, including those run as secondary businesses, is 5, although there are also 6 hobby farmers.

History In 1324, Nockenthal had its first documentary mention as Nockendail, while R√∂tsweiler had its first documentary mention as Rezwiler in 1429. As part of the Principality of Birkenfeld, the two villages both belonged to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea (the Principality was an exclave). This had been set forth by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, in the wake of Napoleon‚Äôs downfall. The villages remained as part of Oldenburg for the rest of the 19th century, right through Imperial times, the First World War, Weimar times (although by now, Oldenburg had ceased to be a monarchical state) and even into the time of the Third Reich, when in 1937, the former Principality of Birkenfeld was merged into Prussia. By this time, the administrative merger of the two villages of Nockenthal and R√∂tsweiler had taken place. It happened in 1933, after the Nazis had come to power in Oldenburg, which itself had happened some months before Adolf Hitler himself had seized power in Germany as a whole.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Niederw√∂rresbach was shaped by the agate grinders' trade and the quarrying business. The local sport club's artistic gymnastics squad has earned international recognition. Geography =Location= View from the Kehrwald The village of the \\"clicker grinders\\" (Klickerschleifer ‚Äì see explanation under The tradition of \\"clickers\\") lies between the southern edge of the Hunsr√ºck and the mountain range of volcanic origin on the upper Nahe. It is part of the Fischbach valley, and on the municipal outskirts, the namesake river, the W√∂rresbach (also called the Hinterbach) empties into the Fischbach. =Neighbouring municipalities= Niederw√∂rresbach borders in the north on Herrstein. Somewhat farther west is the slate ridge known as the Wirschheck, which leads on into the neighbouring municipality of Oberw√∂rresbach. On Landesstra√üe (State Road) 160, Bundesstra√üe 41 can be reached, as can Fischbach some to the south, and indeed Idar- Oberstein's outlying centre of Weierbach. Also following this stretch of road is the Deutsche Edelsteinstra√üe (\\"German Gem Road\\"), which in Niederw√∂rresbach's west follows Landesstra√üe 175 towards Herborn and Vollmersbach. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Niederw√∂rresbach are the outlying centres of Birfink and Hainbuch, and also the outlying homestead of \\"Auf Faustert\\".Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 20 =Geology= Niederw√∂rresbach is built on conglomerates from the Upper Rotliegend. This is permeated with igneous rocks such as porphyry and melaphyre. Going eastwards, the material changes over into the Devonian slate that characterizes the Rhenish Massif. Also worth mentioning here are the limonite stones on the \\"Wart\\" and a sandstone quarry on the \\"Klink\\". To this day, the firm F. L. Juchem & S√∂hne maintains, among other construction-related operations, a quarry along the road to Fischbach. =Climate= Niederw√∂rresbach, which is part of the greater Nahe valley, has a relatively mild climate that, in principle at least, would even allow winegrowing, although the vineyard that once lay between Niederw√∂rresbach and Oberw√∂rresbach is now no longer under cultivation. Yearly precipitation in Niederw√∂rresbach amounts to 718 mm, which falls into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 44% of the German Weather Service's weather stations lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in November. In that month, precipitation is 1.4 times what it is in April. Precipitation varies only slightly, and is quite evenly spread throughout the year. Only at 1% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded. History In 1047, when Niederw√∂rresbach belonged to the Nahegau, it had its first documentary mention as a holding of the Counts of Sponheim. It was then that Count Eberhard von Sponheim endowed two farmsteads at Werngisbach. These were owned by the Sponheims until 1427, although from time to time they were pledged or redefined. Thereafter, the joint rulers were the Electorate of Trier, Baden and Palatinate-Simmern, until 1559. Baden then became the sole ruler, although for a time it was also jointly ruled along with the Princes of Zweibr√ºcken, until in 1792, the French annexed the Rhine's left bank to their country. During this time, the village belonged to the Department of Sarre and the Canton and Mairie (\\"Mayoralty\\") of Herrstein. When German troops marched into France in 1814 and put an end to Napoleon's rule, Duke Peter Friedrich Ludwig of Oldenburg acquired the two exclaves of L√ºbeck and the Birkenfelder Land. The latter, in which Niederw√∂rresbach lay, persisted right through Imperial times until the First World War, and although it then ceased to be the Principality of Birkenfeld within the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, it nonetheless persisted as a \\"Free State\\" in the Weimar Republic. This came to an end on 1 April 1937 when the Nazis merged the exclave with Prussia within the framework of the Greater Hamburg Act in exchange for Wilhelmshaven. =Church= Church at Niederw√∂rresbach As early as 1560, the village had a parish seat with a branch in Fischbach. Later, Niederw√∂rresbach became, like the whole surrounding area, Evangelical-Lutheran. The church that stands today was consecrated on 26 January 1833 by the Reverend Karl Phillip Daniel Koch. However, it turned out that masonry work on the tower had been botched by the builders, and in 1865, the tower had to be torn down. In its stead, a somewhat funny-looking cupola was built. This was, however, replaced with a new tower, which can still be seen today. The church is equipped with a Stumm organ. =The child and youth home= Portal The 1830s and 1840s in the Birkenfelder Land were characterized by livestock plagues and bad harvests, leading to rising food prices and hunger. The Principality of Birkenfeld had to enact a law in 1842 dealing with public care of the poor to supply the poorest with their most basic needs. Soup kitchens were set up, wood was given away for free and potatoes were sold below the usual price. The child and youth home's original house On 16 October 1846, the Reverend Friedrich Adolf Koch, a clergyman at Herrstein, originally from Niederw√∂rresbach, established an educational home at his parents' house, a small farmhouse on the way towards Herrstein. He himself organized the financing for the home's necessary basic facilities by raffling donations in kind. Under the motto \\"Der Herr ist des Armen Schutz\\" (from Psalm 9:9, although this German translation literally means \\"The Lord is the poor man's shelter\\"), the first group of residents at the home were 18 girls. Maintenance costs were partly covered by the girls' handicrafts, which were raffled off, and collections, but there was always a debt of several hundred Thaler. The child and youth home's main house After the Reverend Koch's death in 1867, the only way to stop the home's closure in 1894 was by having the deaconess's Upper Rhine motherhouse take it over. The great, new main building was completed in 1905 and 1906, whereupon the original house was converted into a commercial building and communal dwellings. Moreover, in the 1980s a modern building with more dwellings and office space was built on the institute's grounds. Today the Deaconry of Kreuznach cares for youths at the home; former facilities for babies and the elderly have been given up to other institutions. The village's appearance nowadays is predominantly characterized by the village square created in the 1980s and the new street, Ortsgemeindestra√üe, built in 1997 and 1998. This remodelling was made possible by the realignment of Landesstra√üe (State Road) 160, which now bypasses the village. Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Niederw√∂rresbach's mayor is Arnold Weinz, and his deputies are Werner Dalheimer and Rudolf Peter Juchem.Niederw√∂rresbach's mayor and his deputies =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Schild schr√§glinks geteilt, linke Seite in Silber und eine nach oben ge√∂ffnete Kette mit roten Klickersteinen, rechte Seite rot-silbern geschacht, belegt mit einem schwarzen Dreiberg. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister argent a chain of clicker stones open to dexter chief gules, and chequy gules and argent issuant from base a mount of three sable. The chain of stones on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side refers to the local tradition of the \\"clicker grinders\\" (Klickerschleifer ‚Äì see explanation under The tradition of \\"clickers\\"), while the \\"chequy\\" field on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the County of Sponheim, and the mount of three ‚Äì a charge called a Dreiberg in German heraldry ‚Äì stands for the Amt within the County of Sponheim in which Niederw√∂rresbach lay, namely Herrstein (whose name literally means \\"Lordstone\\"). Niederw√∂rresbach even today lies in a Verbandsgemeinde of that same name.Description and explanation of Niederw√∂rresbach's arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate's Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Evangelical church, Hauptstra√üe 6 ‚Äì Classicist aisleless church, 1830‚Äì1833, architect Kondukteur Odernheimer; ridge turret 1907; Stumm organ 1850 * Near Hauptstra√üe 28 ‚Äì former bakehouse, open roof frame, possibly from the latter half of the 19th century * Hauptstra√üe 55, 57 ‚Äì children's home of the Rhenish Deaconry; no. 55 gatekeeper's house, partly timber-frame, possibly from the latter half of the 18th century, conversion marked 1845, gateway with bell turret 1905; no. 57 children's home, quarrystone building, 1904/1905, architect August Senz, D√ºsseldorf * Hohlstra√üe 37 ‚Äì day labourer's house, one-floor house with stable underneath, possibly from about 1850/1860 * M√ºhlenweg 4 ‚Äì so-called Litzenbergersche M√ºhle (mill); sandstone barn, 1877; three-floor brick mill building, 1910; stately house, 1914 Der K√§sschmierlecker =The tradition of \\"clickers\\"= Niederw√∂rresbach has a long tradition in the craft of \\"clickers\\" (called Klicker in German). These are ball-shaped, polished agate stones. Agate grinding was an arduous job. The raw stones had to be brought to the village from Idar on foot so that they could be processed the next morning in the grinder's workshop. The so-called Schleiferkrankheit ‚Äì \\"grinder's illness\\" ‚Äì caused by agate dust, lying before the grindstone, poor ventilation and schnapps, which was drunk to suppress the affliction, saw to it that Klickerschliffer ‚Äì \\"clicker grinders\\" ‚Äì did not get older than 40 years. Bearing witness even today to their craft is a charge in the municipal coat of arms depicting a chain of these clickers. =K√§sschmier= In bygone, harsher times, K√§sschmier (roughly, \\"cheese smear\\") was a tasty and cheap food that anyone could afford. It was a kind of quark mixed with herbs and sugar, and eaten as a spread or with jacket potatoes. Even today, people from Niederw√∂rresbach are still jokingly called Werzbacher K√§sschmierlecker by those from neighbouring places. A statue of the personification of the K√§sschmierlecker has immortalized this image of Niederw√∂rresbachers. It stands on the village square, which was remodelled in the 1980s. =Clubs= Sport club Activity centre for artistic gymnastics The sport club, founded in 1888, has already managed to make a mark at national and international levels. The artistic gymnastics squad won many German championship titles in the 1970s and 1980s under coach Marianne Reimann. The highlight of the successes was the regional 1983 Sportswoman of the Year title earned by Niederw√∂rresbach gymnast Heike Schwarm, along with her squad, which was recognized as Team of the Year. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, SV Niederw√∂rresbach ‚Äì the sport club ‚Äì furnished West Germany with one third of its squad in the persons of Heike Schwarm and Angela Golz. As part of a ceremonial act in Marianne Reimann's and her women gymnasts' honour at the Artistic Gymnastics Centre in Frankfurt on 20 January 1989, representatives of the Rhineland-Palatinate state government suggested building a \\"State Activity Centre for Artistic Gymnastics\\" in Niederw√∂rresbach, whose great sport hall was finished in the early 1990s. The work was a joint effort with the Verbandsgemeinde. The successes continue: in 1997, Wladimir Klimenko became German Youth Champion in artistic gymnastics. Multipurpose hall Among the club's footballers, the \\"A-Youth\\" team is worthy of mention. This squad managed to reach the Bezirksliga level and eventually became 1977 Vice-Champions. A year later, Niederw√∂rresbach's Michael Dusek moved to Bundesliga team 1. FC Kaiserslautern, with whom he stayed until the 1987/1988 season. Until 2006 he trained and coordinated the youth of \\"1. FCK.\\" Currently, the first team plays in the Bezirksliga Nahe. Music club Gasthaus Wei√ü (inn) The music club was founded on 9 September 1891 at the Gasthaus Wei√ü (inn) on the initiative of the first musical conductor, Emil Wei√ü. From 1911 until the end of the First World War, there was another music club in the village that called itself \\"Germania\\". Over its more than century- long history, the music club has set itself the task of fostering wind- instrument music and promoting culture in the municipality. In particular, its work with youth is worthy of mention. Other clubs Niederw√∂rresbach's oldest club is the men's singing club, which came into being as a result of a proposal by the teacher Christian Schmidt in 1860. He also directed it until his death in 1890. In 1928, a mixed choir was established, which is linked to the club. Niederw√∂rresbach also has a volunteer fire brigade, founded in 1933, a local chapter of the German Red Cross, the marksmen's club, founded in 1975, and an angling club (since 1990). The Wanderfreunde e. V. Niederw√∂rresbach (hiking club) split away from the sport club in 1992; it had formerly been a department of the sport club, founded in 1974.

He is best known for publishing the first description of the disease that would later be named Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Biography Hashimoto was born on 5 May 1881, in the village of Iga-cho, Ayama-gun, in Mie Prefecture as the third son of Kennosuke Hashimoto, a physician. Hashimoto's family traditionally served as physicians to the district's feudal lords for centuries. Hashimoto's grandfather, General Hashimoto, was the most famous physician in the prefecture in his time, after having studied Dutch medicine. Hashimoto began his primary education in 1886 and entered the in Kyoto, considered to be at the time a leading pre-university educational establishment. In 1903, he enrolled in Fukuoka Medical College in Fukuoka, a branch of the newly-established Kyushu University. He was amongst the first medical graduates when he graduated in 1907. He then entered the First Surgical Bureau and studied medicine under the direction of Professor (1867‚Äì1945), the first Japanese neurosurgeon. While working on his M.D. thesis, he examined four histology samples from surgically excised thyroids and described his findings as 'struma lymphomatosa'. He published his findings in the German journal Archiv f√ºr Klinische Chirurgie as German was considered the lingua franca of academia during this time. Hashimoto also published two further papers on erysipelas and on penetrating chest wall injuries. Hashimoto circa 1912 In 1912, Hashimoto traveled to University of G√∂ttingen in Germany to study pathology under the training of Professor Eduard Kaufmann, with particular emphasis on tuberculosis of the urinary tract. In 1915, Hashimoto returned to Japan via England as the First World War was underway. In 1916, he came back to his hometown, Igamachi, and became the town doctor, setting up his own surgical clinic. As a surgeon and general practitioner, Hashimoto would frequently visit patients in their homes, often utilising a rickshaw, regardless of distance. In critical patients, he would perform surgery at their homes with only trained nurses accompanying him. He was also known to not charge fees to his poor patients. During this time, Hashimoto was often seen studying medicine late in the evening and was regarded as a lifelong student. In December 1933, Hashimoto fell ill with typhoid fever and eventually died at home on 9 January 1934 at the age of 52. Scientific activities In 1912, he published a paper, K≈çj≈çsen rinpa-setsu shush≈ç-teki henka ni kansuru kenky≈´ h≈çkoku or Zur Kenntnis der lymphomat√∂sen Ver√§nderung der Schilddr√ºse (Struma lymphomatosa) or (Report on lymphomatous goiter) in \\"Archiv f√ºr klinische Chirurgie\\", Berlin, 1912:97:219-248. Years later, this paper was evaluated by English and American researchers, and the disease it described was recognized as an independent illness. In American medical books, it was named Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Personal life Hashimoto Street Hashimoto married Yoshiko Miyake, the daughter of a naval doctor who studied Japanese literature at the Nara' Women's Higher College for Education. The couple had 4 children; one daughter (Hanako) and three sons (Ken'ichi, Haruo, Kazuo). He was a devout Buddhist and was head of the Buddhist association at Kyushu University during his time as a student.

Structure  Tpr-Met was generated following a chromosomal rearrangement induced by the treatment of a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line with the carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitronitrosoguanidine. The genomic rearrangement fuses two genetic loci,translocated promoter region, from chromosome 1q25 which encodes a dimerization leucine zipper motif, and MET, from chromosome 7q31 which contributes the kinase domain and carboxy-terminus of the Met RTK. The resulting 65 kDa cytoplasmic Tpr-Met oncoprotein forms a dimer mediated through the Tpr leucine zipper. The Tpr-Met fusion protein lacks the extracellular, transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of c-Met receptor, and has gained the Tpr dimerization motif, which allows constitutive and ligand-independent activation of the kinase. The loss of juxtamembrane sequences, necessary for the negative regulation of kinase activity and receptor degradation, prolongs duration of Met signalling.  Experimental evidences  = Effects in muscle =  Skeletal muscle  Specific expression of Tpr-Met in terminally-differentiated skeletal muscle causes muscle wasting in vivo and exerts anti-differentiation effects in terminally differentiated myotubes. Constitutive activation of MET signaling has been suggested to cause defects in myogenic differentiation, contributing to rhabdomyosarcoma development and progression.  Cardiac muscle  In a transgenic model, cardiac-specific expression of Tpr-Met oncogene during postnatal life causes heart failure with early-onset.

History Nohen's beginnings can be traced back to a time when the location was favourable to transportation because it lay on one of the few fords in the river Nahe's upper valley. As an indication of how important Nohen was geographically in those early days, one need only observe that it was then the only place along the river Nahe that was named after the river (the names ‚ÄúNohen‚Äù and ‚ÄúNahe‚Äù have a common heritage). It was here that one of the oldest north-south trade roads crossed the Nahe. This Bronzestra√üe (‚ÄúBronze Road‚Äù) from the Glan by way of Nohen to the Moselle was expanded in Roman times into a crosslink between the Mainz-Trier and Mainz- Metz roads. The military-strategic importance of the road link with the ford, or later bridge, was great. On the night of 23 and 24 September 1635 and the following morning, a Swedish-French army under Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar‚Äôs leadership went slogging by across the river after their defeat at N√∂rdlingen in the Thirty Years' War on their retreat by way of Birkenfeld to Wallerfangen, even as they were being pursued by the far superior, victorious Imperial army under Count Gallas.

The Lords of Hachenfels are said to be the village's namesake. In 1112, Cuno de Hachenfels cropped up in a document about an exchange of holdings between Disibodenberg Monastery and Provost Richard von Liebfrauen in Mainz. Named as an occupant of the Hachenburg (an old castle near the Hachenfels) in 1128 was Adalbero de Hachenfels, who also cropped up in a donation document from Archbishop of Mainz Adalbert I to Disibodenberg Monastery. In 1140, Emicho VI's two sons formed the lines of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves (Konrad) and the Raugraves (Emich VII). It was in this time that a new castle, the Naumburg, was built near B√§renbach, within whose domain lay Schmidthachenbach. In 1172, Emich VII transferred ownership of the Naumburg to his brother Gerlach. In 1323, Raugrave Conrad sold Archbishop of Trier Baldwin the Naumburg for 1200 Heller, whereupon Baldwin enfeoffed Conrad with the very castle that he had just sold. The year 1361 is important in Schmidthachenbach's history, for this date was to be found on the lintel over the old town hall's door. In 1393, the castle and the Amt of Naumburg fell under the lordship of the Counts of Sponheim, whom the Counts of Oberstein owed allegiance. The Obersteins themselves held the patronage and tithing rights at the parish church at Becherbach, within whose parish lay Schmidthachenbach. This put the village in the ‚ÄúFurther‚Äù County of Sponheim. In 1439, Wyrich von Dune, Lord of Oberstein, was enfeoffed by the Archbishop of Trier with the castle. In 1557, the Reformation was introduced into the County of Sponheim. In 1572, Schmidthachenbach had its first documentary mention under the name Hachenbach. In 1599 came the first documentary mention of the Junkerhof within Schmidthachenbach's limits. The owner at the time was Junker Hans Jakob von Dietz, Lord at Mittelreidenbach. In 1618, the Thirty Years' War broke out, and locally, it gave rise to ‚ÄúThe Legend of the Sunken Rider‚Äù.Text of ‚ÄúThe Legend of the Sunken Rider‚Äù (in German) In 1707, the Amt of Naumburg was taken over by the Margrave of Baden. Beginning in 1795, Schmidthachenbach lay under French rule and became a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) in the canton of Grumbach, the arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre. Beginning in 1798, Schmidthachenbach belonged to the French Republic; in 1800 there were roughly 300 inhabitants. That same year, Johannes B√ºckler, commonly known as ‚ÄúSchinderhannes‚Äù, attacked the Antesm√ºhle, an outlying mill in Schmidthachenbach in the Antes valley. In 1815, in the wake of Napoleon‚Äôs downfall and the Congress of Vienna, French rule ended and Schmidthachenbach found itself in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld while remaining a mairie ‚Äì although now called a B√ºrgermeisterei, the German word for the same thing ‚Äì within the constituent territory of the Principality of Lichtenberg with Sankt Wendel as its capital. In 1834, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld sold the Principality of Lichtenberg to the Kingdom of Prussia, and it became the Sankt Wendel district. At the time when the German Empire was founded in 1871, Schmidthachenbach had 466 inhabitants. The ‚ÄúPeace Oak‚Äù was also planted near the church this year on the occasion of the end of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1937, in the time of the Third Reich, unlike its two neighbouring municipalities, Schmidthachenbach was grouped into the Birkenfeld district. In 1950, Schmidthachenbach had 498 inhabitants, and this year also marked the end of winegrowing in the municipality. In 1957, Flurbereinigung began. In 1958, a memorial was built and dedicated to those who fell or went missing in the First World War and the Second World War.

The former is canting for the first syllable in the municipality's name (Schmidt comes from the base of Schmiede, meaning ‚Äúsmithy‚Äù). It is said that Schmidthachenbach was founded by eight blacksmiths. The latter of the two charges, the oakleaf, represents the natural environment within Schmidthachenbach's limits. The countercompony (that is, two rows of squares of alternating tinctures) pattern is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Counts of Sponheim, who for centuries ruled the area, and bore arms that were ‚Äúchequy‚Äù (similar, but with more than two rows).

History  The organized participation of Bulgarian scientists in space research started in 1969 with the creation of a Scientific Group of Space Physics (SGSP) at the Presidium of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.Kutiev, I., Bulgarian Geophysical Journal, 2008, Vol. 34, p. 55, (in Bulgarian) In 1974, based on the SGSP, the Central Laboratory for Space Research (CLSR) was founded. The Space Research Institute (SRI) at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences succeeded the Central Laboratory for Space Research in 1987. Under the reform carried out at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, by a Resolution of the General Assembly of the BAS of 23 March 2010, the SRI and the Solar-Terrestrial Influences Institute (STII) merged to form a new unit ‚Äì the Space and Solar- Terrestrial Research Institute at the BAS (SSTRI‚ÄìBAS) renamed in 2012 to Space Research and Technology Institute (SRTI). Bulgarian scientists from SRTI-BAS successfully participated in the Intercosmos program, preparing experiments and designing equipment for several satellites and rockets. In 1979, the first Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov flew in space on board of Soyuz 33. In 1981 two satellites were launched - Bulgaria 1300 and Meteor-Priroda 2-4 (Meteor 1-31), furnished entirely with Bulgarian equipment, aimed at studying the ionospheric-magnetospheric relationship and remote sensing of the Earth from space. In 1984 teams from SRTI-BAS took part in the international projects \\"Vega 1 and 2\\" (1984) ‚Äì for realization of the project \\"Venus-Halley's Comet\\".

World energy consumption, 1970‚Äì2025. Source: International Energy Outlook 2004. The mitigation of peak oil is the attempt to delay the date and minimize the social and economic effects of peak oil by reducing the consumption of and reliance on petroleum. By reducing petroleum consumption, mitigation efforts seek to favorably change the shape of the Hubbert curve, which is the graph of real oil production over time predicted by Hubbert peak theory. The peak of this curve is known as peak oil, and by changing the shape of the curve, the timing of the peak in oil production is affected. An analysis by the author of the Hirsch report showed that while the shape of the oil production curve can be affected by mitigation efforts, mitigation efforts are also affected by the shape of Hubbert curve. For the most part, mitigation involves fuel conservation, and the use of alternative and renewable energy sources. The development of unconventional oil resources can extend the supply of petroleum, but does not reduce consumption. Historically, world oil consumption data show that mitigation efforts during the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks lowered oil consumption, while general recessions since the 1970s have had no effect on curbing the oil consumption until 2007. In the United States, oil consumption declines in reaction to high prices. Key questions for mitigation are the viability of methods, the roles of government and private sector and how early these solutions are implemented. The responses to such questions and steps taken towards mitigation may determine whether or not the lifestyle of a society can be maintained, and may affect the population capacity of the planet. Alternative energy The most effective method of mitigating peak oil is to use renewable or alternative energy sources in place of petroleum. Nuclear power, considered by some to be a viable alternative source, can be substituted for petroleum in some cases. China is preparing for the post-peak oil future by building pebble bed reactors configured to produce hydrogen fuel from the electrolysis of water. The use of nuclear power is often a highly contentious issue because of questions of the future availability of fuel and the dangerous nature of nuclear waste. Some current research projects are focused on neutron-free fusion power, in which hydrogen and boron are heated to over 1 billion degrees, though technical and economic barriers still exist. In its October 2009 peak oil report, the Government- supported UK Energy Research Centre warned of the risk that 'rising oil prices will encourage the rapid development of carbon-intensive alternatives which will make it difficult or impossible to prevent dangerous climate changeUKERC Report Finds ‚ÄòSignificant Risk‚Äô of Oil Production Peaking in Ten Years , October 08, 2009, UK Energy Research Centre and stated that 'early investment in low-carbon alternatives to conventional oil is of considerable importance' in avoiding this scenario.Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production , page xi, August 2009, published October 08, 2009, UK Energy Research Centre, Iceland was the first country to suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy, using hydrogen for vehicles and its fishing fleet, in 1998, but the actual progress has been very limited. Transportation fuel use Because most oil is consumed for transportationEIA - International Energy Outlook 2007 - Figure 33 most mitigation discussions revolve around transportation issues. =Fuel substitution= While there is some interchangeability, the alternative energy sources available tend to depend on whether the fuel is being used in static or mobile applications. Biofuel The use of biofuels, which are fuels derived from recently dead biological material, reduces dependence on petroleum and enhances energy security. Biofuels also play significant roles in the \\"food vs fuel\\" debate, mitigation of oil prices, and energy balance and efficiency. Ethanol is a biofuel produced from crops high in sugar (e.g., sugar cane, sweet sorghum)ICRISAT: Sweet sorghum balances food and fuel needs or starch, (corn/maize). Biofuels can also be produced from plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, such as oil palm, soybean, algae, switchgrass, or jatropha. These oils can be burned directly in certain designs of diesel engines, or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel. Wood and its byproducts can also be converted into biofuels such as woodgas, methanol or ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be difficult to accomplish economically. Biofuels are most commonly used in vehicles, and in heating homes, and cooking. Biofuel industries are expanding in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Several firms have successfully created petroleum products in the lab using either solid catalysts or genetically modified microorganisms.Grow your own - The biofuels of the future will be tailor-made, The Economist, June 19th 2008For Future of Biofuel, Secret of MPG Ooze Lies in Mutant Bacteria , Popular Mechanics, June 24, 2008 As of July, 2008, such firms are producing petroleum products in very small quantities, but hope to increase production over the next few years.Biogasoline: The Greener Alternative to Ethanol? Static installations The substitution of oil with other fossil fuels is theoretically relatively easy when static installations are concerned, as in the case for electricity generation. Reserves of coal are substantial, and the technology to use it is well established. Increasing the use of coal, however, would lead to higher carbon emissions which is likely to be politically unacceptable in many countries due to the implications of global warming, although carbon capture and storage may provide a solution. Natural gas is another alternative, and combined cycle power generation using natural gas is the cleanest source of power available using fossil fuels, producing about 30% less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45% less than burning coal. The major difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation and storage because of its low density. Natural gas pipelines are economical, but are impractical across oceans. Mobile applications Due to its high energy density and ease of handling, oil has a unique role as a transportation fuel. There are, however, a number of possible alternatives. Among the biofuels the use of bioethanol and biodiesel is already established to some extent in some countries. The use of hydrogen fuel is another alternative under development in various countries, alongside, hydrogen vehicles though hydrogen is actually an energy storage medium, not a primary energy source, and consequently the use of a non-petroleum source would be required to extract the hydrogen for use. Though hydrogen is currently outperformed in terms of cost and efficiency by battery powered vehicles, there are applications where it would come in useful. Short haul ferries and very cold climates are two examples. Hydrogen fuel cells are about a third as efficient as batteries and double the efficiency of gasoline vehicles. Electric vehicles powered by batteries are another alternative, and these have the advantage of having the highest well-to-wheels efficiency rate of any energy pathway and thus would allow much greater numbers of vehicles than any other methods. In addition, even if the electricity was sourced from coal-fired power plants, two advantages would remain: first it is cheaper to sequester carbon from a few thousand smokestacks than it is to retrofit hundreds of millions of vehicles, and second encouraging the use of electric vehicles allows a further pathway for scaling up of renewable energy sources. Currently the cost of batteries capable powering electric vehicles for a range (comparable to the range of many gasoline vehicles) is prohibitively high, though producing batteries for plug-in hybrids with a range could be done with current technology and current pricing models within the reach of the average person. A plug-in hybrid with a range would have the advantage that it uses no gasoline or diesel at all for the first 40 miles (a distance covering 80% of all vehicle commutes). Unfortunately there are currently no production models of plug-in hybrids or alternative fuel vehicles (other than flex fuel) available from big manufacturers, though both Toyota and General Motors have promised versions around 2010. Fully electric vehicles are available from Tesla Motors for their high priced sports car and also a small city vehicle from Th!nk in Norway, in limited production runs in Norway and the UK. Alternative aviation fuel The Airbus A380 flew on alternative fuel for the first time on 1 February 2008. Boeing also plans to use alternative fuel on the 747.Boeing announce plans to accelerate bio-jet fuel development Because some biofuels such as ethanol contains less energy, more \\"tankstops\\" might be necessary for such planes. The US Air Force is currently in the process of certifying its entire fleet to run on a 50/50 blend of synthetic fuel derived from the Fischer-Tropsch process and JP-8 jet fuel. =Conservation= When alternative fuels are not available, the development of more energy efficient vehicles becomes an important mitigant. Some ways of decreasing the oil used in transportation include increasing the use of bicycles, public transport, carpooling, electric vehicles, and diesel and hybrid vehicles with higher fuel efficiency. More comprehensive mitigations include better land use planning through smart growth to reduce the need for private transportation, increased capacity and use of mass transit, vanpooling and carpooling, bus rapid transit, telecommuting, and human-powered transport from current levels. Rationing and driving bans are also forms of reducing private transportation. The higher oil prices of 2007 and 2008 caused United States drivers to begin driving less in 2007 and to a much greater extent in the first three months of 2008. In order to deal with potential problems from peak oil, Colin Campbell has proposed the Rimini protocol, a plan which among other things would require countries to balance oil consumption with their current production. Unconventional oil Unconventional oil is oil produced or extracted using techniques other than the traditional oil well method from sources such as oil sands, oil shale and the conversion of coal or natural gas to liquid hydrocarbons through processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Currently, unconventional oil production is less efficient and has a larger environmental impact relative to conventional oil production. Compared to conventional oil, much more energy is required to extract oil from non- conventional sources, so increasing costs and carbon emissions. Technology, such as using steam injection in oil sands deposits, is being developed to increase the efficiency of unconventional oil production. Synthetic fuel, created via coal liquefaction, requires no engine modifications for use in standard automobiles. As a byproduct of oil embargoes during Apartheid in South Africa, Sasol, using the Fischer-Tropsch process, developed relatively low-cost coal-based fuel. Currently, about 30% of South Africa's transport- fuel (mostly diesel) is produced from coal. With crude-oil prices above US$40 per barrel, this process is now cost-effective. Masdar, an experiment in mitigation One government which is moving forward with mitigation plans is the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The United Arab Emirates economy minister stated in 2007 that the UAE do not believe that relying on oil revenues is sustainable, and so are moving to diversify their economies. Besides allotting land for solar power plants and partnering with Massachusetts Institute of Technology to build an alternative energy research institute, a new city is being constructed east-southeast of the city of Abu Dhabi, which will rely entirely on solar energy, with a sustainable, zero-carbon, zero-waste ecology. Known as Masdar (Arabic for source), the initiative is headed by the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (ADFEC) The project is estimated to take some 10 years to complete, with the first phase complete and habitable in 2009, and a goal of housing 50,000 people and 1,500 businesses. The city is intended to cover , with no point further than 200 m from a solar powered personal rapid transit link, housing energy, science and technology communities, commercial areas, a university, and the headquarters of the Future Energy Company. By relying on sustainable energy sources, keeping cars out of the city, returning to older architectural conventions (such as reducing air conditioning costs with large tents and narrow spaces between buildings), using sewage to produce energy and create soil, taking advantage of all recycling opportunities (including for and from construction), and reusing gray water, Masdar is designed to be a city which will consume no oil. Bioplastics Another major factor in petroleum demand is the widespread use of petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, corn starch, hemp plants, pea starch, Development of a pea starch film with trigger biodegradation properties for agricultural applications or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles. US government debate over mitigation strategies Part of the current debate revolves around energy policy, and whether to shift funding to increasing energy conservation, fuel efficiency, or other energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear power. At congressional peak oil hearings, Rep. Tom Udall argued that while rising oil prices would encourage alternatives (both on the supply and demand side), the costs and impacts of other issues involved with petroleum based personal transportation (such as pollution, the economic effects of global warming, security threats caused by sending vast amounts of money to the Middle East, and the costs of road maintenance) should also be taken into account. \\"Because the price of oil is artificially low, significant private investment in alternative technologies that provide a long-term payback does not exist. Until oil and its alternatives compete in a fair market, new technologies will not thrive.\\" In 2005, the Congressional Budget Office suggested that, \\"the federal government could more effectively increase the efficiency of the nation's automotive fleet by raising gasoline taxes, imposing user fees on the purchase of low-mileage-per-gallon vehicles, or both.\\" This would give automakers more incentive to research alternative fuel technology and increased efficiency (through lighter vehicles, better aerodynamics, and less wasted energy). Hans-Holger Rogner, a section head at the IAEA, warned in 1997 that the level of incentive required for market driven research and development will actually rise. Because production costs are not expected to decrease and because of the continued emphasis companies give to short-term profits, \\"a regional breakdown for 11 world regions indicates that neither hydrocarbon resource availability nor costs are likely to become forces that automatically would help wean the global energy system from the use of fossil fuel during the next century.\\" The problems of privately funded research and development are not unique to peak oil mitigation. Bronwyn H. Hall, graduate economics professor at the Haas School of Business, points out that, \\"even if problems associated with incomplete appropriability of the returns to R&D; are solved using intellectual property protection, subsidies, or tax incentives, it may still be difficult or costly to finance R&D; using capital from sources external to the firm or entrepreneur. That is, there is often a wedge, sometimes large, between the rate of return required by an entrepreneur investing his own funds and that required by external investors.\\" The severity of the problem for energy is echoed in the International Energy Agency's latest report In the US, transportation by car is guided more by the government than by an invisible hand. Roads and the interstate highway system were built by local, state and federal governments and paid for by income taxes, property taxes, fuel taxes, and tolls. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is designed to offset market imbalances. Municipal parking is frequently subsidized. Emission standards regulate pollution by cars. US fuel economy standards exist but are not high enough to have effect. There is also a gas guzzler tax of limited scope. The United States offers tax credits for certain vehicles and these frequently are hybrids or compressed natural gas cars (see Energy Policy Act of 2005). In order to be profitable, many alternatives to oil require the price of oil to remain above some level. Investors in these alternatives must gamble with the limited data on oil reserves available. This imperfect information can lead to a market failure caused by a move by nature. One explanation for this is Hotelling's rule for non-renewable resources. Even with perfect information the price of oil correlates with spare capacity and spare capacity does not warn of a peak. For example, in the early 1960s (10 years before oil production peaked in the United States), there was enough spare capacity in US production that Hubbert's predicted peak of 1966-1971 was \\"at the very least completely unrealistic to most people,\\" preventing the necessary steps being taken to mitigate the situation. The absence of accurate information about spare production capacity exacerbates the current situation. Lester Brown believes this problem might be solved by the government establishing a price floor for oil. A tax shift raising gas taxes is the same idea. Opponents of such a price floor argue that the markets would distrust the government's ability to keep the policy when oil prices are low. In 2007, a Pentagon Report, \\"Space-Based Solar Power: An Opportunity for Strategic Security\\" proposed Space-Based Solar Power as a macro solution to peak oil and fossil fuel depletion. Recently a proposal for US leadership in SBSP won the SECDEF D3 competition. Engineer Keith Henson discussed the scale in \\"Dollar a Gallon Gasoline\\". Mike Snead has recently assessed prospects for US fossil fuels and SSP in \\"US fossil fuel energy insecurity and space solar power\\". Snead and Henso recently put out a video. Implications of an unmitigated world peak Oil depletion scenarios According to the Hirsch report prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy in 2005, a global decline in oil production would have serious social and economic implications without due preparation. Initially, an unmitigated peak in oil production would manifest itself as rapidly escalating prices and a worldwide energy crisis. While past oil shortages stemmed from a temporary insufficiency of supply, crossing Hubbert's Peak means that the production of oil continues to decline, so demand must be reduced to meet supply. If alternatives or conservation (orderly demand destruction) are not forthcoming, then disorderly demand destruction will occur, with the possible effect that the many products and services produced with oil become scarcer, leading to lower living standards. *Air travel, using roughly 7% of world oil consumption, would be one of the affected services. The energy density of hydrocarbons and the power density of a jet engine are so necessary for aviation that hydrocarbon fuels are nearly impossible to replace with electricity, to an extent beyond any other common mode of transport. *A US Army Corps of Engineers report on the military's energy options states *Shipping costs Shipping costs are particularly relevant to a country like Japan that has greater food miles. *Increasing cost of oil for importing countries ultimately reduces those countries' purchase of non-oil goods abroad. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco discusses oil and the US balance of trade: US indications of economic volatility have manifested themselves in the largest increase in inflation rates in 15 years (Sept. 2005), due mostly to higher energy costs. *Significant oil producing countries will have a national purchasing advantage over similar countries with no oil to sell. This can result in larger militaries for oil producers or inflation of the price of whatever commodities they purchase. Saudi Arabia purchased US$40 billion worth of arms from the US between 1990 and 2000. *The United States averaged of gas per person in 2004. Therefore, increased gasoline cost will likely make gas reducing alternatives increasingly necessary and common for lower income US residents. Those who feel that much more drastic imminent social and cultural changes will occur from oil shortages are known as doomers.

The part of the village on the W√∂rresbach's left bank was held by the County of Sponheim, to which the Amt of Herrstein also belonged, and the part over on the right bank was held by the V√∂gte of Hunolstein. Both these noble houses are reflected by today's civic coat of arms. An important event in the village's history came to pass in 1933 after the Nazis came to power in the Free State of Oldenburg (this was even before Adolf Hitler‚Äôs official seizure of power that same year). One of the new government‚Äôs first initiatives was administrative reform for Oldenburg, which was followed on 27 April 1933 by the similar Gesetz zur Vereinfachung und Verbilligung der Verwaltung (‚ÄúLaw for simplifying administration and reducing its cost‚Äù) for the Landesteil of Birkenfeld (Oldenburg's exclave in the Hunsr√ºck; most of Oldenburg's territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea). Through this new law, 18 formerly self-administering municipalities were amalgamated; this included Oberw√∂rresbach, which hitherto had been a self-administering municipality. Nonetheless, it was unceremoniously made part of the municipality of Herrstein. After the Second World War, in 1950, Oberw√∂rresbach's householders petitioned for ‚Äúindependent municipal administration, as it was in the years before 1933.‚Äù Their wish was granted, and with effect from 1 May 1952, Oberw√∂rresbach once more became a self-administering municipality.Oberw√∂rresbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Oberw√∂rresbach's mayor is Heidemarie Juchum, and her deputies are J√ºrgen Schneider and Mathias Druglat.Oberw√∂rresbach‚Äôs mayor and her deputies =Coat of arms= Hunolstein arms Sponheim arms The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per bend sinister Or three blocks gules and chequy gules and argent, issuant from base a mount of three sable.

They advanced to the first division Oberliga Nord in 1955, with their best result coming as a third-place finish there in 1959. After the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's first top flight professional league, in 1963, VfR found itself in the second division Regionalliga, but quickly slipped from the professional ranks. During the late 50s and early 60s, until the formation of the Bundesliga, the club's amateur side played second-division football in the Amateurliga Schleswig-Holstein. In the mid-90s the team returned to the Oberliga Nord (IV) and finished as vice-champions in 2002‚Äì03.

Geography =Location= The municipality lies at the southern edge of the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald, a self-contained forest within the Hunsr√ºck. The municipal area measures 1 133 ha, of which somewhat more than half is state forest, and indeed 76.5% of it is wooded. The area makes Rinzenberg the district's seventh biggest municipality by land area. Only the three towns (Birkenfeld, Idar- Oberstein and Baumholder) and the municipalities of Allenbach, Hoppst√§dten- Weiersbach and Br√ºcken have larger municipal areas.

History In 1269, Rinzenberg probably had its first documentary mention as Ritzeberg, and thereafter belonged to those villages that were bought back by the Counts of Sponheim after they had enfeoffed Wilhelm von Schwarzenberg with them. Rinzenberg had its heyday in the 16th century when the village profited from business earned by the Hambacher Sauerbrunnen ‚Äì a mineral spring from which flowed acidic water ‚Äì which allowed the village to become a spa. The wealth in Rinzenberg manifested itself in stately stone buildings. In the war-wracked times of the 17th century, few people travelled to Rinzenberg for its waters, and the village's star faded. Sponheim rule came to an end with the French Revolutionary Wars. Beginning then, Rinzenberg lay under French rule. After the Wehrmacht was defeated and the Third Reich fell as the Second World War drew to an end in 1945, Rinzenberg had to share the burden of the war's consequences. A whole army of French forestry workers ‚Äì for Rinzenberg was in the French zone of occupation ‚Äì descended on the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald and built a sawmill, and whole forest districts were then clearcut. This went on for years. According to precise plans, usable, high-quality stands of trees were felled, sawn and shipped to France for reconstruction efforts. The formerly gentle contours of the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald became cleft-filled and jagged against the sky in the background.

Despite honest, hard work, things only ever got worse for him, and it became ever harder to keep himself and his loved ones fed. One night, he had an odd dream: at his bed stood a man who said ‚ÄúYou go to too much toil and trouble! To Koblenz with you, onto the bridge. There you will find your luck.‚Äù The dream recurred, and after the third time, he told his wife about it. She thought it would do no harm to go there once and have a look. So, the man set off from the Hochwald to the Rhine, hardly bothering to stop for food or sleep along the way, for he did not want to miss out on his luck. :When he arrived in Koblenz, he went straight to the old bridge on the Moselle to seek his luck. He left no stone unturned, he looked in every crack of the bridge‚Äôs old stonework, but nowhere could he find any luck. For three long days he sought his luck on the bridge, but in vain. He became annoyed with himself and called out ‚ÄúWhat an ass I am, believing in dreams! May the devil take the Koblenz Bridge together with its luck!‚Äù :Then, a rather serious-looking man came up to him. Giving him a puzzled look in the face, he said, ‚ÄúYou may well not be very bright to believe so in dreams. How on earth can one seek luck on the Koblenz Bridge? If I were as simple as you, I would long ago have sought out the little nest of Rinzenberg, which I have seen three times in dreams.‚Äù :At this, the Hochwald man pricked up his ears, and, curious, he asked, ‚ÄúWhat is this about Rinzenberg?‚Äù :‚ÄúAh,‚Äù began the Moselle man, ‚Äúthere, deep in the village well has lain for centuries a chest full of gold, supposedly. What one can make of such dreamt-up treasures, though, you now ought to see quite clearly for yourself!‚Äù :No sooner had the Rinzenberg man heard this than he sped off like lightning. As quickly as he could, he hurried up the Rhine and the Nahe to his little Hochwald village. Then, at night, when the world was asleep, he climbed into the village well and there found an iron chest full of gold, which he fetched out. Thus, he had found his luck on the bridge at Koblenz.The Legend of Old Rinzenberg This story has even found its way into the municipality's coat of arms, which shows a golden well, meant to represent the one in the story. Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Running east of the municipality is Bundesstra√üe 269, which to the south leads to the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier). Serving nearby Neubr√ºcke is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). =Economy= Rinzenberg's 300 or so inhabitants no longer earn their livelihoods mainly from agriculture and forestry, which once characterized the local economy.

The Hfq protein (also known as HF-I protein) encoded by the hfq gene was discovered in 1968 as an Escherichia coli host factor that was essential for replication of the bacteriophage QŒ≤. It is now clear that Hfq is an abundant bacterial RNA binding protein which has many important physiological roles that are usually mediated by interacting with Hfq binding sRNA. In E. coli, Hfq mutants show multiple stress response related phenotypes. The Hfq protein is now known to regulate the translation of two major stress transcription factors ( œÉS (RpoS) and œÉE (RpoE) ) in Enterobacteria. It also regulates sRNA in Vibrio cholerae, a specific example being MicX sRNA. In Salmonella typhimurium, Hfq has been shown to be an essential virulence factor as its deletion attenuates the ability of S.typhimurium to invade epithelial cells, secrete virulence factors or survive in cultured macrophages. In Salmonella, Hfq deletion mutants are also non motile and exhibit chronic activation of the sigma mediated envelope stress response. A CLIP-Seq study of Hfq in Salmonella has revealed 640 binding sites across the Salmonella transcriptome. The majority of these binding sites was found in mRNAs and sRNAs. In Photorhabdus luminescens, a deletion of the hfq gene causes loss of secondary metabolite production. Hfq mediates its pleiotropic effects through several mechanisms. It interacts with regulatory sRNA and facilitates their antisense interaction with their targets. It also acts independently to modulate mRNA decay (directing mRNA transcripts for degradation) and also acts as a repressor of mRNA translation. Genomic SELEX has been used to show that Hfq binding RNAs are enriched in the sequence motif 5'-AAYAAYAA-3'. Hfq was also found to act on ribosome biogenesis in E. coli, specifically on the 30S subunit. Hfq mutants accumulate higher levels of immature small subunits and decreased translation accuracy. This function on the bacterial ribosome could also account for the pleiotropic effect typical of Hfq deletion strains. Electron microscopy imaging reveals that, in addition to the expected localization of this protein in cytoplasmic regions and in the nucleoid, an important fraction of Hfq is located in close proximity to the membrane.  Crystallographic structures  Six crystallographic structures of 4 different Hfq proteins have been published so far; E. coli Hfq (), P. aeruginosa Hfq in a low salt condition () and a high salt condition (), Hfq from S. aureus with bound RNA () and without (), and the Hfq(-like) protein from M. jannaschii (). All six structures confirm the hexameric ring-shape of a Hfq protein complex. See also *RNA-OUT References 11\\\\. Mol Cell. 2002 Jan;9(1):23-30.

The Straumann Group also offers services to the dental profession worldwide, including training and education, which is provided in collaboration with the International Team for Implantology (ITI) and the Instituto Latino Americano de Pesquisa e Ensino Odontol√≥gico (ILAPEO). Altogether, the Straumann Group employs approximately 6,000 people worldwide and its products and services are available in more than 100 countries through a broad network of distribution subsidiaries and partners.  History  The history of the Straumann Group has three distinct eras and spans more than half a century. It began in the Swiss village of Waldenburg in 1954 with the foundation of a research institute bearing the name of its founder, Dr Ing. Reinhard Straumann. = 1954-1970 = Between 1954 and 1970, the company specialized in alloys used in timing instruments and in materials testing. Among Straumann's renowned inventions in this period were special alloys that are still used in watch springs today. A breakthrough in the use of non- corroding alloys for treating bone fractures prompted Dr Fritz Straumann to enter the fields of orthopedics and dental implantology, which began the second phase of the company's history. 1954 In the small town of Waldenburg, at the foot of the Swiss Jura, Reinhard Straumann founds the \\"Dr Ing. R. Straumann Research Institute AG\\". 1960 The Swiss Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) is looking for a company that is capable of providing materials for internal fixation implants - Dr H.C. Fritz Straumann, son of the company's founder, gets in touch. = 1970-1990 = Between 1970 and 1990, Straumann became a leading manufacturer of osteosynthesis implants. A management buy-out of the osteosynthesis division in 1990 led to the creation of Stratec (subsequently Synthes) as a separate company. 1990 thus marked the beginning of the Straumann Group as it is known today. Thomas Straumann, grandson of the founder, headed the remaining part of the firm, which employed just 25 people focused exclusively on dental implants. Another major milestone in the company's history was in 1980 when Straumann established a partnership with the International Team for Implantology. The 1980s also marked the company's geographic expansion, with subsidiaries in Germany (1980) and the US (1989). The following are examples of achievements: 1974 The first dental implants are developed at the Institut Straumann and undergo successful clinical testing at the University of Berne. 1980 Under the aegis of Dr Fritz Straumann, Waldenburg, and Prof Schroeder, University of Berne, the International Team for Implantology, the ITI, is founded. 1990 After a management buy-out of the internal fixation division, Thomas Straumann focuses the activities of the Institut Straumann AG on the area of implant dentistry. = 1998‚Äìpresent = In 1998, Straumann Holding AG became a publicly traded company on the Swiss exchange. Through the acquisition of Kuros Therapeutics (2002) and Biora (2003), Straumann entered the promising field of oral tissue regeneration. 1998 The Straumann Holding AG goes public and is listed on the Swiss stock exchange. 2000 With the opening of the production site in Villeret, located in the Berne Jura, and the Technology Center in Waldenburg, new dimensions open up for the international Straumann group. 2002 Straumann acquires Kuros Therapeutics AG and extends its activities into the field of biomaterials. 2003 Straumann acquires the Swedish company Biora, a pioneer in the area of biologically based regeneration of dental tissue. 2004 Straumann moves into its new headquarters in Basel. 2011 Investment in Dental Wings, a developer and provider of CADCAM software and scanning technology, based in Canada. 2012 Straumann acquires Neodent from Brazil and extends its activities into the value Market. 2013 Straumann invests in Medentika and Createch ‚Äì both companies are active in prosthetics. 2016 Straumann acquires Equinox, in the fast-growing value segment in India. The company also invests in the French implant maker Anthogyr to address the non- premium segment in China. 2017 Straumann took a controlling interest in Medentika. 2018 Straumann invests in botiss biomedical and fully acquires Createch. The Group also gains control of T-Plus in Taiwan. Additionally, the Straumann Group entered the orthodontics field and strengthened its digital capabilities through acquisitions and alliances: full acquisition of Dental Wings; acquisition of ClearCorrect (US-based provider of clear-aligner tooth correction solutions); investment in Geniova (based in Spain and specialized in developing innovative hybrid aligner solutions); investment in Rapid Shape (3D-printing systems); increased investment in Rodo Medical; acquisition of Loop Digital Solutions; partnership with 3Shape (scanning and software solutions). 2019 The Group takes over French implant manufacturer Anthogyr.

Lying at an altitude of , with an area of , it is the highest and largest artificial lake in Serbia. It was created in 1947‚Äì51 when the peat bog Vlasinsko blato (Vlasina mud) was closed off by a dam and submerged by the waters of incoming rivers, chiefly the Vlasina.  Location  The lake lies at on a plateau called Vlasina in the municipalities of Surdulica and Crna Trava. The lake is most easily accessible from the southwestern side, by a long section of the M1.13 road from Surdulica, which itself lies east of the Ni≈°-Skopje motorway on the E75 European Route. The road extends west, towards the Bulgarian border crossing at Strezimirovci, some away. Along the west shore, the regional road R122 leads across the dam towards Crna Trava in the north.  Geography  Veliki Stre≈°er (1875m), mountain peak, seen from the Vlasina Lake plateau. Vlasina River sources are below the peak. The plateau is surrounded by the mountains of ƒåemernik, Vardenik and Gramada. Geological and hydrological surveys showed that lake used to existed in this area in distant history. The lake runs North-South for a length of about and has a maximum width of approximately . Its average depth is and its maximum depth is , near the dam. The central part of the lake is wide and deep. Its eastern coastline is jagged, with two bays: larger Biljanina bara and smaller Murin zaliv separated by Taraija peninsula. The southern part of the lake, between Bratanov del peninsula and the mouth of Bo≈æiƒáki kanal is shallower (), with swampy coasts and peat. The \\"working level of reservoir\\" is projected between the altitudes of and . = Islands = There are two permanent islands on the lake, along its eastern coast: Dugi Del () and Stratorija (). Both islands are covered with green areas and forests. Along with those islands, one of the lake's most famous features are the floating islands. They didn't exist in the former peat bog and began appearing after 1948, when the lake was created. They are formed when at high water level, loose chunks of peat thick break off the shore. It is estimated that the peat chunks took 5,000 years to form. There are up to 30 floating islands at the time. Driven by the wind, they float from one shore of the lake to another, carrying the flora and fauna, and serving as shelter and a food source for fish. For that reason, they are an attractive target for fishermen, however it is forbidden to visit them or disturb them because of the unique animal and plant ecosystems, though walking on them is practically impossible since they don't have solid ground. The largest such island has an area of , it is referred to as \\"Moby-Dick\\" by the local population, and is the largest such formation in the Balkans. It is overgrown with dense vegetation, including birch trees. Carried by the water currents and strong winds, in 2016 \\"Moby-Dick\\" almost reached the shore near the \\"Vlasina\\" hotel, softly attaching itself to the bank and becoming a major tourist attraction. Previous such occurrence happened in the mid-1990s. During the extremely low water level, it was reported in August 2018 that the island was partially stranded on dry ground. Another major storm and strong wind, detached Moby-Dick on 15 August 2020, which after four years continued to float on the lake surface. = Water = The temperature of the water reaches in the summer months, making for refreshing swimming. It freezes in the winter and the ice crust can be as much as thick. The temperature also varies with location and depth. In the village of Topli Dol south of the lake, there is a water factory \\"Vlasinka\\", producing high-quality mineral water called \\"Vlasinska Rosa\\", a renowned brand in Serbia. It was purchased by The Coca- Cola Company in 2005. There are some 70 natural water springs in the lake area. The best known kladenac (cold water spring), noted for its cold water and most visited by the tourists, is the Sveti Nikola (Saint Nicholas) spring.  Dams  Vlasina Lake The dam is located in the northwestern part of the lake. It is an embankment dam, built of a concrete core with an earth-filled cover. First plans for the power plant were made in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, during the Interbellum. Construction ran from 1946 to 1948, when the reservoir was first filled. It is long, wide at the base and at the top, and high (of which is above the ground). The reservoir it creates has a volume of around . Of these, is usable for hydroelectric exploitation. The system of 4 hydroelectric plants called Vrla (I-IV) lies downstream of the lake, on the Vrla River, with a total capacity of . A part of the hydroelectric system is the pump station \\"Lisina\\", which pumps in water from the nearby Lisina Lake, chiefly in summer months. Vlasina Lake is also fed by numerous streams, descending from the surrounding mountains. The water level varies, depending on the water influx and drainage of the dam. Two artificial canals enter the lake near the dam: ƒåemerniƒçki kanal from the west and Strvna from east. The construction of the entire Vrla complex of 4 power plants was finished in 1958. The water from another artificial lake, Lisina, on the Bo≈æiƒçka Reka, is being partially rerouted into the lakes watershed. As the Bo≈æiƒçka Reka is the longer headstream of the Dragovi≈°tica, which in turn flows into the Struma in Bulgaria which empties into the Aegean Sea in Greece. As the lake, via its outflow Vlasina, belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, this way the artificial bifurcation was created.  Biodiversity and protection  Protected areas of the nature preserve \\"Vlasina\\" Flora and fauna of the lake, and the entire surrounding Vlasina region, are rich, and include several endemic species. It features over 850 species of flora and over 180 species of vertebrates, including rare species of mammals, reptiles and amphibians. = Plants = The lake's surroundings are a mixture of meadows and high-altitude forests, especially birch, beech, pine and juniper (the former two indigenous, and the latter chiefly introduced by afforestation of the western shore). The indigenous trees downy birch and yellow beech (characteristic for its ever- yellow leaf color) stand out among the species of trees. Sundew is the only carnivorous plant in Serbia and is unique to the Vlasina region. It is estimated that over 300 herbal species in the region are medicinal. = Animals = The lake is home to 16 species of fish. These include: Brown Trout, Ohrid trout, Rainbow trout, European perch, European eel, Eurasian minnow, Mediterranean barbel, grass carp, common carp, crucian carp, Prussian carp, tench, roach, common chub, pumpkinseed and others. Ohrid trout was stocked and it successfully adapted to the environment, making it a popular for fishing. Birds includes gray heron, mallard, tufted duck and cormorant. Mammalian species include wild boars, wolves, foxes, hares, roe deer and feral horses. = Protection = By the decision of Government of Serbia in 2006, the Vlasina region is protected as a nature preserve of special interest at category I. The total protected area is , of which are in the 1st level of protection (islands of Dugi Del and Stratorija), in the 2nd level and in the 3rd level of protection. = 2018 water level fluctuation = In the summer of 2018, both the citizens and the tourists, so as the administration of the Surdulica municipality reported the record low water level in the lake. Municipality issued a statement saying that the sudden water discharge at the dam may destroy the part of the plan and animal life in the lake. Numerous boats and barges were stranded, so as the \\"Moby-Dick\\", the largest floating island on the lake. It is estimated that the level fell for up to . The Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS), a state-owned electric utility power company admitted that they are forced to discharge larger amounts of water from the lake because of the repairs on one of the four Vrla hydro power plants, but that no harm will be done. The reconstructed power plant, Vrla I, was built in 1955 and it was stated that the renovation \\"was necessary\\" and that the works will be finished by October 2018. By October other floating islands got stranded, the boat traffic was made more difficult and the water level dropped by . In the shallower bays the water receded significantly and they have been described as \\"desolate\\". The EPS claimed that the works will last for only 30 days and that water level has to be reduced to but continued to claim that no harm will be done. University of Belgrade Geography Faculty contradicted the company's claim. The longer floating island are stranded, the greater is the chance that they will not \\"unhinge\\" from the bank when the water rises. Head of the local protection enterprise accused EPS of lowering the water level to produce more electricity rather than to renovate the plant. The EPS stated that \\"in the period to come\\", they will start to pump the water from the Lisine Lake into the Vlasina.  Tourism  Vlasina Lake Current tourist capacity includes around 300 beds in hotels \\"Vlasina\\" and \\"Narcis\\", offering a modest range of services. Along with regular tourists, they often host sporting teams from Serbia and abroad, as the lake is a popular destination for summer training due to its high altitude. Sporting grounds include a large football field, small sports field and weightlifting room. An ambitious project for development of tourism is planned for the Vlasina area by the country's Development plan and the Ministry of Tourism, and it is included in the \\"21 projects for the 21st century\\" plan. The planned facilities include a new tourist center Novi Rid, with 1000 beds and shopping center, tourist center Krstinci with 350 beds, center \\"D≈æukelice\\" for summer sports, a marina for sailboats (motorboats are forbidden on the lake), a number of ski lifts and facilities for Nordic skiing. Touristic attractions could include the numerous churches from the 19th century in the area. Also, the region is known for many popular local legends, which include myths of the giant water beasts, fairies and the now submerged bridge which was allegedly built by the Crusaders on their way to Jerusalem.

It was originally built in 1931 by duck farmer Martin Maurer in nearby Riverhead, and used as a shop to sell ducks and duck eggs. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It is a principal building on the Big Duck Ranch, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description The Big Duck is a prime example of literalism in advertising. The building measures wide, long and tall to the top of the head. The duck's eyes are made from Ford Model T tail lights and the interior floor space is confined to by . The wood frame, wire mesh/concrete surface building was designed in the shape of a Pekin duck in order to house a retail poultry store.

The builders Smith and Yeager completed the concrete finish work on the Big Duck which was featured in Atlas Cement's 1931 calendar. Merlin Yeager noted that most of the duck is actually finished with Portland Cement, but they ran out and finished with Atlas Cement. The Big Duck was also featured in Popular Mechanics magazine. In 1937, Martin Maurer moved the building four miles (6 km) southeast to Flanders, where it occupied a prominent location near the duck barns and marshes of Maurer's new duck ranch. The entire area, including Flanders and Riverhead, was the center of Long Island's well-known duck- farming industry. By 1939 there were about 90 duck farms in Suffolk County.Determining the Facts Reading 1: Representational Architecture, Roadside Attractions, National Park Service.

In this sketch, the duck was named Moby, and two sailors were enlisted on a voyage to search for the duck, although it was right behind them the whole time. As of November 2017, for the past 29 years at Christmas time, the Big Duck has been lit up with Christmas lights placed along a giant wreath which hangs around the duck's neck. Local residents hold a Christmas lighting ceremony each year when the lights are turned on, and the ceremony is covered by local news.

However, in architecture the term \\"duck\\" is used more specifically to describe buildings that are in the shape of an everyday object to which they relate. According to the Long Island newspaper Newsday, \\"The Big Duck has influenced the world of architecture; any building that is shaped like its product is called a 'duck'.\\"Newsday (Feb. 21, 2007): \\"It Happened on Long Island\\" (column): \\"1988: Suffolk County Adopts the Big Duck\\", by Cynthia Blair Edward Tufte's The Visual Display of Quantitative Information uses the term \\"duck\\", explicitly named after this building, to describe irrelevant decorative elements in information design. The Big Duck was the target of widespread criticism during the 1960s and early 1970s but the building did have its architectural defenders. Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown said that since the building combined functional and symbolic aspects of architecture it was noteworthy. It was Venturi and Scott Brown who coined the term \\"duck\\" to describe a building in which the architecture is subordinate to the overall symbolic form.

He, ' appointed a very considerable army to rendezvous upon the borders, under the command of Sir Robert Bowes, one of his wardens, the Earl of Angus, and his brothers. James had nominated the Earl of Huntly to command his army on the borders, consisting of 10,000 men; and his lieutenant was Sir Walter Lindsay of Torphichen, who had seen a great deal of foreign service, and was esteemed an' excellent-ofÔ¨Åcer. Huntly acquitted himself admirably Well in his commission, and was so well served by his spies, as to have certain intelligence that the English intended to surprise and burn Jedburgh and Kelso. The English army, under Bowes and the Doug lases, continued still on the borders; and the Scottish nobility and gentry had resolved ‚Äônot to attack them on their own ground, nor to act offensively, unless their enemies invaded Scotland. Huntly being informed that the English had ad advanced, on the 24th of August, to a place called Haddonrig, and that they had destroyed a great part of‚Äú the Scottish and debatable lands, resolved to engage them; and the English Were astonished when they saw the Scottish drawn up in order of battle about day-break. Neither party could now retreat without Ô¨Åghting; and Torphichen, who led the van. consisting of 2000 of the best troops of Scotland, charged the enemy so furiously, that Huntly gained a complete and easy victory. Above 2,000 0f the English were killed, and 600 taken prisoner among whom Were their General Bowes, Sir William Mowbray, and about sixty of the most distinguished northern barons; the Earl of Angus escaped by the swiftness of his horse.

Total electron content (or TEC) is an important descriptive quantity for the ionosphere of the Earth. TEC is the total number of electrons integrated between two points, along a tube of one meter squared cross section, i.e., the electron columnar number density. It is often reported in multiples of the so-called TEC unit, defined as TECU=1016el/m2. TEC is significant in determining the scintillation and group and phase delays of a radio wave through a medium. Ionospheric TEC is characterized by observing carrier phase delays of received radio signals transmitted from satellites located above the ionosphere, often using Global Positioning System satellites. TEC is strongly affected by solar activity. Formulation The TEC is path-dependent. By definition, it can be calculated by integrating along the path ds through the ionosphere with the location- dependent electron density ne(s): : TEC = \\\\int n_e(s)\\\\,ds The vertical TEC (VTEC) is determined by integration of the electron density on a perpendicular to the ground standing route, the slant TEC (STEC) is obtained by integrating over any straight path. To first order, the ionospheric radio effect is proportional to TEC and inversely proportional to the radio frequency f. The ionospheric phase delay reads: :\\\\tau_p^\\\\mathrm{iono} = -\\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{TEC}}{f^2} while the ionospheric group delay has the same magnitude but opposite sign: :\\\\tau_g^\\\\mathrm{iono} = -\\\\tau_p^\\\\mathrm{iono} The proportionality constant Œ∫ reads:, eq.(25.5) :\\\\kappa = q^2 / (8 \\\\pi^2 m_e \\\\epsilon_0) = c^2 r_e / (2\\\\pi) where q, me, re are the electron charge, mass, and radius, respectively; c is the vacuum speed of light and œµ0 is the vacuum permittivity.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies in the Hunsr√ºck just north of Idar-Oberstein. =Neighbouring municipalities= Vollmersbach borders in the north on the municipality of Veitsrodt and in the east, south and west on the town of Idar- Oberstein. Vollmersbach also meets the municipality of Niederw√∂rresbach at a single point in the northeast. History In the 1st century BC, the region between the rivers Nahe and Meuse was inhabited by the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, who crossed the Rhine quite early on and settled in the area where Vollmersbach now lies, and from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. Until Drusus's time ‚Äì shortly before the Christian Era ‚Äì they lived fully independently, even while recognizing the Roman Empire‚Äôs hegemony in the region. They were grouped into the Roman province of Germania Superior. Unhindered, Roman influence made itself felt in the Vollmersbach area, and the Empire‚Äôs borders spread beyond the Rhine. Still preserved from that time are parts of the extensive road network that the Romans built for transport through their conquered provinces. Such a road ran near where Vollmersbach now lies. The stretch within municipal limits, which is still used today, is known to the local inhabitants simply as the Strohs, a dialectal form of the German word Stra√üe (‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúroad‚Äù), thereby giving it the meaning that it actually bore fifteen centuries ago when it was the only road that linked the inhabitants to neighbouring centres and the main roads. In the 4th century, the Alamanni were thrusting their way into Roman territory on the Rhine's left bank, and may even have settled in what is now Vollmersbach. With the partition of the Frankish Empire negotiated in the 843 Treaty of Verdun, the three Gaue (roughly ‚Äúshires‚Äù) on the Rhine's left bank, the Wormsgau, the Speyergau and the Nahegau, passed to Louis the German‚Äôs inheritance. The Nahegau‚Äôs nearby border villages were Hammerstein, Enzweiler, Idar-Algenrodt (all three of which are nowadays part of Idar- Oberstein), Mackenrodt, Hettenrodt and Kirschweiler. The border led on up the Idarbach to its source and to the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest). From this time forth, Vollmersbach is witnessed continuously, but for a brief interruption in the 13th century, in historical records. Vollmersbach was settled quite early on. It is among the district‚Äôs oldest populated centres. In 902, Vollmersbach had its first documentary mention, although it is likely somewhat older. In 990, Vollmersbach was mentioned by the name Folemarisbach along with the Saint Maximin‚Äôs Abbey holding of Siemora (Simmern and Dhaun). The village was also mentioned as belonging to Saint Maximin‚Äôs in a 1044 document that used the slightly different spelling Folemaresbach. It is unknown how this name developed into the modern name Vollmersbach. Moreover, what is also unknown is whether these documents are genuine. They could be among the many so-called Saint Maximin‚Äôs Abbey forgeries. Whatever the truth about the documents is, the fact that there is also a brook with the name Vollmersbach (Bach is German for ‚Äúbrook‚Äù) implies that the village must have lain either near or right on this brook. In ascertaining where the oldest part of the village lay, two local cadastral names are important: ‚ÄúIn der Hubstatt‚Äù and ‚ÄúAm Hofgarten‚Äù (the latter literally means ‚Äúat the estate garden‚Äù, while the first syllable of the former is a corruption of Hof ‚Äì estate ‚Äì with the full name meaning ‚Äúin the estate place‚Äù). A further estate area seems to have sprung up in the 14th century, early in the time when Vollmersbach belonged to the lordship of Oberstein, in the upper part of the village. It is to this place that the cadastral name ‚ÄúAm Hofgarten‚Äù, used until 1822, refers. Thereafter, the estate or the manor house would have stood on the plot nowadays known as the D√∂rn‚Äôsches Grundst√ºck, which is where the ancestral seat of the now widespread family Dreher stood until a few years ago, as likewise did the tithe barn, which was Vollmersbach's oldest building. It was from this site that reconstruction began after the widespread destruction wrought by the Thirty Years' War. The old upper village formed Vollmersbach's core until the early 19th century. Here were found an old public well, the first watermain, a winepress, and, built in 1856, the ‚Äúspringing well‚Äù. Along with Oberstein, which had hitherto been under Prussian administration, Vollmersbach passed on 9 April 1817 to the newly formed Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. Vollmersbach, which had always belonged politically to Oberstein, passed upon the formation of the Stadtb√ºrgermeisterei (‚Äútown mayoralty‚Äù) of Oberstein in 1902 to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Idar-Land. This mayoralty was abolished with effect from 9 October 1933 by the Nazis, and on the same day, Vollmersbach was grouped into the B√ºrgermeisterei of Herrstein. The Second World War came home to Vollmersbach on the night of 9‚Äì10 August 1943 when an RAF Handley Page Halifax piloted by Jim Pestridge crashed in a meadow in the municipality. It had been shot down during an attack on Mannheim by German night fighter pilot Oberleutnant Johannes Engels over Idar-Oberstein. Three of the four crewmen died in the wreck, but Pestridge managed to save himself by bailing out. He came down near Nahbollenbach (now an outlying centre of Idar-Oberstein) and was later captured at Birkenfeld railway station.Vollmersbach‚Äôs history =Population development= Vollmersbach's population grew from the end of the Thirty Years' War to the onset of the Third Reich thus (all figures but the first are rough estimates):Vollmersbach‚Äôs population development { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"100\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  Population - align=\\"center\\"  1648  11 - align=\\"center\\"  1679  40 - align=\\"center\\"  1751  90 - align=\\"center\\"  1815  152 - align=\\"center\\"  1832  218 - align=\\"center\\"  1845  244 - align=\\"center\\"  1855  271 - align=\\"center\\"  1933  442 } Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Vollmersbach's mayor is Hans Dieter Petsch, and his deputies are J√ºrgen Christmann and Hartmut Gutendorf.Vollmersbach‚Äôs executive =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per pale argent a lion rampant gules armed and crowned Or, and azure a fess wavy between a saltire humetty and Saint Andrew's Well in trian aspect, all of the first. The charge on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side, the lion, is the device formerly borne by the Oberstein Estate, the feudal lordship that once held Vollmersbach. The wavy fess (that is, horizontal stripe) on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side stands for the village's namesake river. The saltire (that is, X-shaped cross) is Saint Andrew‚Äôs attribute, and the trough below the fess is Saint Andrew‚Äôs Well (Andreasbrunnen). The arms have been borne since 27 November 1963.Description and explanation of Vollmersbach‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland- Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Flurstra√üe 5 ‚Äì prefabricated house; cube-shaped clapboard building with hipped roof, 1925 Saint Andrew‚Äôs Well Saint Andrew‚Äôs Well (Andreasbrunnen in High German, or Ennerschbure in the local speech) lies towards the west end of the municipal area. In bygone times, healing effects were always ascribed to the well‚Äôs water. Those seeking health were still coming here, and giving thanks for their healing in the form of at least three white things: an egg, a silver coin and a white child‚Äôs shirt. =Gemstones= Vollmersbach lies on the themed tourist route called the Deutsche Edelsteinstra√üe (‚ÄúGerman Gem Road‚Äù), and is also 1992-1994 German Gemstone Queen Kerstin Huth's home village. =Clubs= Vollmersbach has always been known for two sports in particular. As early as about 1900, tennis and field handball were being played. Today, TV Vollmersbach (TV here stands for Turnverein ‚Äì ‚Äúgymnastic club‚Äù) plays tennis with many youth teams and a strong men's team. Since 2000, TV Vollmersbach has been playing team handball in a combined effort with the gymnastic club in Idar in the Rhineland Handball League. In the 2010/2011 season, the men's team was playing in the State League. Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Running through Vollmersbach are bus routes 346 and 351 run by ORN (Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe) within the RNN (Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund), which runs at least every two hours to Idar-Oberstein's railway station, which as a Regional-Express and Regionalbahn stop, is linked by way of the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken) to the Saarland and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. The Rhein-Nahe-Express running the Mainz-Saarbr√ºcken route serves the station hourly. Every other train goes through to the main railway station in Frankfurt with a stop at Frankfurt Airport. Formerly, fast trains on the Frankfurt-Paris route had a stop at Idar-Oberstein. The bus trip to the station takes 12 minutes. Outbound buses go into the Hunsr√ºck, to Rhaunen, Herrstein and Wickenrodt, although some go through to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. This trip takes roughly 45 minutes. There are three bus stops in Vollmersbach, Ort, Klepp and T√ºrmchen, although the last one is served only once daily by a school bus. Within the framework of ‚Äúvillage renewal‚Äù in 2009 and 2010, the whole village thoroughfare was redeveloped. =Gemstone industry= Cropraising and livestock raising must have become secondary occupations quite early on, for in the days of the earliest known gemstone cutters, names from Vollmersbach crop up. The art of engraving in Vollmersbach was famous within professional circles. The local merchandise was and still is shipped to customers all round the world. A few firms in the village today process industrial stones for a great variety of different purposes.Vollmersbach‚Äôs gemstone industry =Public institutions= With the opening of the new community centre in 1987, people in Vollmersbach had for the first time an opportunity to pursue cultural and sporting interests at facilities designed with them in mind. The floor plan inside is well subdivided. Besides a modern sporthall, there is also an inn.Vollmersbach‚Äôs history References External links * Category:Birkenfeld (district) ","title":"Vollmersbach"},{"id":"11882177","text":"Gerach is an Ortsgemeinde ‚Äì a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality ‚Äì in the Birkenfeld district in Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany.

Four draft constitutions existed: one belonging to the National Liberal Party, written with contributions from Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu; one composed by R. BoilƒÉ at Cluj, under the influence of the Romanian National Party; one by Constantin Stere, representing the views of the Peasants' Party; and a fourth by C. Berariu. Except for Stere's proposal, which involved a unicameral legislature, proportional representation and popular consultation through the plebiscite, the other three were inspired (when it came to political organisation) by the 1866 Constitution. The Liberals came to power in 1922 and managed to push through their own draft, which was approved 247-8 (with two abstentions) in the Chamber of Deputies on March 26, 1923, and the next day in the Senate, 137-2 (with two abstentions). It was published in Monitorul Oficial and came into force on March 29. The constitution had eight titles and 138 articles, of which 76 came in their entirety from its predecessor. It enshrined the principles of popular sovereignty (exercised through representatives), separation of powers in the state, rule of law and decentralisation. Rights and freedoms for all citizens were recognised, regardless of ethnicity, language, religion or social class; the right to own property was guaranteed and, for the first time, the nationalisation of mineral deposits was provided for. The Kingdom of Romania was defined as a ‚Äúunitary and indivisible national state‚Äù, with an inalienable territory. The state guaranteed freedom of expression and assembly, of conscience and of religion, and declared that ‚Äúas the Romanian Orthodox Church is the religion of the great majority of Romanians it is the dominant church in the Romanian State, while the Greek- Catholic Church has primacy before other faiths‚Äù. Regarding state organisation, legislative power was entrusted to Parliament (Senate and Assembly of Deputies) and the King; executive power to the King, who delegated it to the Council of Ministers; and judicial power to the central and local judicial organs. The right to vote was expanded beyond the 1866 regulations: it was universal for all males, equal, direct, compulsory and secret, based on majority representation. The Assembly of Deputies was elected through universal suffrage, while the Senate comprised members elected by different electoral bodies (the Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Labour, and professors, all divided into separate colleges), and members by right: the heir to the throne; Metropolitan bishops; diocesan bishops of the Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches; heads of state-recognised religious bodies; the president of the Romanian Academy; former presidents of the Council of Ministers; former ministers with at least six years‚Äô seniority; former presidents of either legislative chamber who held this function for at least eight ordinary sessions; former senators and deputies elected to at least ten legislatures, irrespective of their duration; former presidents of the High Court of Cassation and Justice; reserve and retired generals; former presidents of the National Assemblies at Chi≈üinƒÉu, CernƒÉu≈£i and Alba Iulia, which proclaimed their respective provinces‚Äô union with Romania in 1918. A special section discussing the King provides that the throne should remain with the House of Hohenzollern, \\"from male to male in order of primogeniture and with the perpetual exclusion of women and their descendants\\". The King's person was declared inviolable. As with the 1866 document, while the king was vested with executive power, he was not personally responsible for exercising it. Rather, responsibility rested with the ministers; all acts of the sovereign had to be countersigned by a minister, who then became responsible for it. Although the constitution was very advanced and democratic in many respects, it also contained imperfections in the functioning of state institutions that made it easy to subvert democracy. For instance, the King appointed the president of the Council of Ministers, who then organised elections. The government was thus in a position to ensure that its party won a majority in the legislature. In a well-functioning democracy, a government represents the will of parliament and not vice versa, as generally happened in the interwar period. The 1923 Constitution was abrogated when its February 1938 successor came into force. It was then partly revived after the King Michael Coup of August 23, 1944, and definitively abrogated when Romania became a republic on December 30, 1947. During this latter period, in July 1946, the Senate was abolished--the only significant modification to the document. References * Stoica, Stan (coordinator).

In the early 16th century, the village belonged to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves and together with the neighbouring village of Wickenrodt formed a court region (Gericht). In 1515, Sonnschied was split from Wickenrodt by the second Waldgravial-Rhinegravial partition treaty. In the early 18th century, Sonnschied was held by the Counts of Sahn-Kyrburg, who were an offshoot of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. In the 1727 contribution and taxation register, the number of names listed implies that there were only seven houses or households in the village then. These inhabitants, though, were the ones who built the Evangelical chapel in 1727-1729, which even today is still parochially bound to the parish of Wickenrodt. In 1844 and 1845, the village underwent its first precise measurement. The surveyor noted that Sonnschied had at least three wells: one communal well and two private well facilities, each used by four or five families. As early as 1900 or thereabouts, households were supplied with running water, which flowed from an adit lying above the village. In 1916 came electric light. Archival records also show that there was a small substation maintained in Sonnschied at that time by the local electric company, the Oberstein-Idarer Elektrizit√§tsgesellschaft.

History In 1051, Hausen had its first documentary mention, although the village may be even older, for even then, it had a church. With this church, this village set on top of a cliff terrace overlooking a great bend in the Kyrbach was already earning considerable importance in the Middle Ages as the hub of a great parish, to which, among others, Laufersweiler, Woppenroth, Lindenschied, Oberkirn and Schwerbach belonged. While Laufersweiler split away from the parish quite early on, Woppenroth entered into parochial ties with Dickenschied beginning in 1976, after the 1969 administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate. Within the same framework, Lindenschied had its own parochial ties transferred from Hausen to Dickenschied. Both municipalities thus also switched from the Trier church district to the Simmern-Trarbach church district. The Hausen Evangelical parish now encompasses the villages of Hausen, Oberkirn (which has its own church) and Schwerbach. The church, originally consecrated to Saint Remigius, still has its Romanesque quire tower with its four tapering floors. The aisleless three-sided structure behind it was built on only in 1747 after the mediaeval nave had fallen into disrepair. The historical village centre can be found tightly grouped about the church, but there is a newer centre in the village over on a slope. Running from there from the place where the dale broadens out is a farm lane leading to the outlying farmsteads (Aussiedlerh√∂fe) and then on towards G√∂senroth, which follows an old Schmidtburg Ritter- und Pfaffenstra√üe (‚Äúknight and parson road‚Äù ‚Äì those two social classes were then particularly mobile), which likely was already used in Roman times, and which later served as one of the most important transport links between the castles on the Nahe and the Moselle. Besides agriculture, forestry and mills, of which the Hausener Bauernm√ºhle on the Idarbach can still be seen, slate mining also held great importance right up to the mid 20th century. In the heavily wooded Kascheckt√§lchen (a small dale) between Hausen and Oberkirn, great waste heaps and various other relics from the Layen quarry can still be seen.

The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per pale Or a lion rampant sinister gules armed and langued azure and gules a house argent masoned sable with two windows and one door of the same. The German blazon does not mention that the lion is supposed to be sinister (that is, facing heraldic left, which is the armsbearer's left and viewer's right). The lion on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves. The house on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is a canting charge for the municipality's name, Hausen, derived from the word Haus (‚Äúhouse‚Äù).

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies 8 km west of Idar-Oberstein and 10 km northeast of Birkenfeld. History In 1324, Oberbrombach had its first documentary mention. Ten or perhaps as many as twelve families lived here then. It can be assumed, though, that the village had existed long before that as a permanently populated place. In the document in question, twelve men are mentioned by name as having to vouch to Countess Loretta of Sponheim that they would prevent any flight from the land. Oberbrombach was thereafter a relatively important place for those days. It was at the time favoured by its location at the crossing of two ancient travel routes. The road from Metz by way of Birkenfeld to Oberstein crossed the way from the Moselle by way of Allenbach to the Frauenburg (castle) and on to the river Glan. A good hundred years after the first documentary mention, the village was bereft of any villagers. Quite likely, those that had lived in Oberbrombach in the latter half of the 14th century had fallen victim to the Plague, which was rife in those days. In the 1438 Sponheim taxation book listing payments in kind, it was noted that ten considerable farmsteads were to be found in Oberbrombach, but that nobody dwelt there any longer. In 1465, four farmsteads were once more occupied. In 1563, twelve families were counted in the village; by 1607, this had risen to 27. In the Thirty Years' War, Oberbrombach, like other villages in the area, was hit hard. After the war had ended, the village boasted only seven families. Only slowly did the population recover from this blow over the decades that followed. In 1723, seventeen farmsteads were once more occupied, and there were 81 inhabitants in the village. This had risen to 34 families and 160 inhabitants by 1777. The area of land available for farming was not quite enough to feed the population. Many times the reeves had to avail themselves of help from the Amt administration in Birkenfeld to defend the ancestral municipal and grazing rights boundaries against livestock herds from R√∂tsweiler and those belonging to the tenants of the lordly Winnenberger Hof (farming estate). About 1780, the first municipal land distribution came into force; that is to say, land owned by the municipality was shared out to private owners to boost agricultural production. In 1817, Oberbrombach passed as part of the Principality of Birkenfeld to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. From 1830 to 1890, 91 persons emigrated from the village, most out of pure need, to seek better economic conditions elsewhere, mainly in North and South America. About the middle of the 19th century, the agate- grinding trade gained a foothold in the village. Anyone who did not own enough land to feed his family had to look around for extra work. These people went mainly to the grinding mills on the Schwollbach, and a few went to the ones on the river Nahe. There was only ever one such mill within Oberbrombach's limits. It was built about 1850, but was torn down only several years later, in 1856, to make way for the new Rhine-Nahe Railway. The farming population's burden of work was greatly lightened when the municipality acquired a steam- powered threshing machine. In 1884, the local farmers founded a Dampf-Dresch- Actiengesellschaft (‚ÄúSteam Threshing Corporation‚Äù). Over the years that followed, Oberbrombach's steam threshing machine found itself in service in many of the surrounding villages, too; it could be hired at hourly rates. Standing in contrast to the general poverty suffered by most people in the village in the latter half of the 19th century was the municipality's own wealth. No other municipality for a great distance in any direction could boast such riches as Oberbrombach could. Over decades the Sch√∂ffen (roughly ‚Äúlay jurists‚Äù) and the municipal council had ancient woodlands felled, mainly oak and pine, in rank overexploitation, using the proceeds to fill the municipal coffers. Tree bark sales, too, brought good earnings until 1890. Municipal councillors in those days behaved like bankers. The earnings were lent out to interest-paying borrowers in the area and partly also invested in fixed-interest bonds. In 1825, the municipality made a building ‚Äì a herdsman's house ‚Äì available as a Schullocal (roughly ‚Äúbranch school‚Äù) for the first time. In 1842, the first new schoolhouse was built. In 1887 the municipality established a graveyard. In the years that followed, there was much talk about building a central waterworks. It was not until 1908, however, that work was finished on the watermain, which was fed by two springs more than 6 km away from Oberbrombach, up above Leisel. At the same time, a newer schoolhouse was being planned; it was completed in 1911. In 1912, Oberbrombach was connected to the electrical grid; even the old steam threshing machine was converted to electrical operation that same year. Moreover, electricity made work much easier for the gemstone grinders. Instead of having to trudge daily down to the mill on a river several kilometres away to work at their trade, they could now set up grinding and polishing shops right in their houses. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, the municipal bell was melted down for war requirements, and the municipality ploughed a substantial amount of its wealth into war bonds. In four years‚Äô time, of course, history showed what a poor investment this was. When Germany lost the war, Oberbrombach lost all its wealth. After many years of making loans to borrowers, the municipality itself had to become a borrower. Beginning in the late 1920s, diamond grinders quickly rose in importance in Oberbrombach. In the years between the world wars, more than half the village's families were ‚Äúgrinder-farmers‚Äù. Next to the gemstone-grinding trade, craftsmen and -women in other trades in the village were numerically insignificant. In 1937, in the time of the Third Reich, Oberbrombach passed to Prussia‚Äôs Birkenfeld district. After the Second World War, the village belonged to the French zone of occupation. Since 1946, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Also after the war, an even swifter economic shift came about in Oberbrombach. Agriculture quickly lost much importance, and gemstone grinding temporarily enjoyed an economic boom, but its heyday only lasted until the 1960s. Since 1973 Oberbrombach has belonged to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld. After school services were permanently moved to the Mittelpunktschule (‚Äúmidpoint school‚Äù, a central school, designed to eliminate smaller outlying schools) in Niederbrombach, the municipality converted the two schoolrooms in Oberbrombach into a community centre in 1981. In the 1990s, the sewer system was overhauled and the village streets were cobbled or paved with asphalt. Today the workforce is all but exclusively made up of those who work at jobs outside the municipality. Of the once more than 40 primary and secondary agricultural operations in the village, only three are left.

Fort Maurepas was designated temporarily as the capital of Louisiana (New France) in 1719. The capital was moved from Mobile (in present- day Alabama) westward to Biloxi (present-day Mississippi} then to New Orleans in 1722 on the Mississippi River. Government buildings in the latter city were still under construction. Toponymy The name Biloxi in French was spelled Bilocci, in a transliteration of the name of the local Native American tribe. The military camp was also known in French as Fort Maurepas to honor Louis Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Maurepas from the city of Maurepas. It appeared as \\"Fort Bilocci\\" on English maps updated circa the years 1710/1725. \\"Pas-Kaart Van de Golff van Mexico\\" (map from Amsterdam/1710), Edge of the Map Incorporated, 2007, webpage: [http://www.raremaps.com/cgi-bin/gallery.pl/archivedetail/3176 Raremaps-Archive-3176]. \\"A New Map of as much of North & South America\\" (London/1725), Edge of the Map Incorporated, 2007, webpage: [http://www.raremaps.com/cgi-bin/gallery.pl/archivedetail/7278 Raremaps- Archive-7278]. French Louisiana (part of New France) was known in French as La Louisiane in colonial times. In modern times it is referred to as La Louisiane fran√ßaise to distinguish it from the modern state of Louisiana (also \\"Louisiane\\" in French).\\"La Louisiane fran√ßaise\\" (in French), by Virginie Tanlay, from book Histoire de la Louisiane, webpage: [flfa.free.fr/enquete7.htm flfa-enquete7]: states that Iberville chose \\"le site de Bilocci\\" (or Biloxi). History The fort was completed on May 1, 1699 under direction of French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville, who sailed for France on May 4. He appointed his teenage brother Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville as second in command after the French commandant Sauvolle de la Villantry (c.1671‚Äì1701). Vieux Biloxi (Fort Maurepas) on the Biloxi Coast (site B on the map) M. d'Iberville originally intended to establish a French colony along the Mississippi River. However, because of its flooding, he had been unable to find a suitable location during his first voyage of discovery up the Mississippi in March 1699. He returned from his river journey on April 1, and spent another week in searching the shores adjacent to Ship Island, where the fleet had been anchored. On Tuesday, April 7, 1699, d'Iberville and Surgeres observed \\"an elevated place that appeared very suitable\\". This spot was on the northeast shore of Biloxi Bay. They had found the bay was 7‚Äì8 feet (2 m) deep. They decided to construct the fort there, as they \\"could find no spot more convenient, and our provisions were failing, we could search no longer\\". On Wednesday, April 8, they commenced to cut away the trees preparatory for construction of the fort. All the men \\"worked vigorously\\", and by the end of the month, the fort had been finished. They also carved what is known as the Iberville stone, claiming the site for France. This is now held by the Louisiana State Museum.Online Exhibits: The Cabildo: Two Centuries of Louisiana History, \\"Colonial Louisiana\\", Louisiana State Museum, 2017; accessed 30 May 2017 The expedition journal reported: The best men were selected to remain at the fort, including detachments of soldiers to place with the Canadians (the French also had a colony in what is now Quebec and along the upper Mississippi River) and workmen, and sailors to serve on the gunboats. Altogether about 100 people were left at Fort Maurepas while Iberville sailed back to France on May 4, 1699. Those remaining included: * M. de Sauvolle de la Villantry, lieutenant of a company and naval ensign of the frigate Le Marin, was left in command as governor. * Bienville, king's lieutenant of the marine guard of the frigate La Badine was next in command. * Le Vasseur de Boussouelle, a Canadian, was major. * De Bordenac was chaplain, and M. Care was surgeon. * Also: two captains, two cannoniers, four sailors, eighteen filibusters, ten mechanics, 6 masons, 13 Canadians, and 20 sub-officers and soldiers who comprised the garrison. Few of the colonists were experienced with agriculture, and the colony never became self- sustaining. The climate and soil were different than they were familiar with. On the return of d'Iberville to Old Biloxi in January 1700, he brought with him sixty Canadian immigrants and a large supply of provisions and stores. On this second voyage, he was instructed: > to breed the Buffalo at Biloxi; to seek for pearls; to examine the wild > mulberry with the view to silk [silk worms on leaves]; the timber for > shipbuilding, and to seek for mines. Expeditions in search of gold, jewels > and valuable furs were the main goals of the colonists. They made thorough > explorations of the Mississippi River and the surrounding country. In 1700, Le Sueur was sent to the upper Mississippi with 20 men to establish a fort in the Sioux country. His government intended to take over the copper mines of the Sioux Indians in the interests of France. Meanwhile, the French had established forts and settlements in the Illinois country. Learning of the French colony at Old Biloxi, Canadians came by the boatload down the Mississippi from the upper country (today's Quebec). Fathers Davion and Montigny, accompanied by a few Frenchmen, were th first visitors at the fort, having made the journey downriver in canoes. In May 1700, the settlers were visited by M. Sagan, a traveler from Canada. He carried a request from the French minister to the governor M. de Sauvolle, asking that Sagan be furnished with 24 pirogues and 100 Canadians in order to explore the Missouri River and its branches, a major tributary of the Mississippi that has its confluence at what later developed as Saint Louis. During the absence of d'Iberville, his young brother Bienville made further expeditions to try to secure the prosperity of the colony. But the colonists suffered from tropical diseases of the region: many died from yellow fever, including the governor, M. de Sauvolle, who died in the summer of 1700. Bienville became ranking chief in command, and acted as commandant. On September 16, 1700, a party of Choctaw warriors arrived at Biloxi, asking for French troops to help them fight against the Chickasaw, their traditional enemies among native groups. The Choctaw during this period had 40 villages, with more than 5,000 warriors. On October 25, 20 Mobile natives arrived at Fort Maurepas. They were said to have about 400 fighting men. On December 18, 1700, a shallop arrived from the Spanish settlement at Pensacola to the east, with the news that d'Iberville and Serigny had reached there with the king's ships, the Renomm√©e of fifty guns, and the Palmier of 44 guns. This was welcome news to the garrison, which had been living for more than 3 months on little more than corn. They had lost more than 60 men due to disease, leaving only 150 persons in the colony. Bienville was ordered to evacuate Biloxi, and move to a settlement on the Mobile River. On January 5, 1701, Bienville departed for the Mobile River, leaving 20 men under the command of M. de Boisbriant as garrison at the fort. At Dauphin Island, Bienville met with his brothers de Serigny and Chateaugue, who had arrived with a detachment of sailors and workmen. They were to build a magazine for storage of goods and provisions which had been brought from France. On the Kith, he commenced to build the Fort Louis de la Mobile, about 12 leagues above the present city of Mobile, on the right bank of the river. It was the official center of the Gulf Coast colony for the next nine years, until the new Fort Conde was built. (Mobile city developed around it.) In 1717, when the channel at Dauphine island (present-day Dauphin Island) had become choked with sand, \\"Fort Maurepas\\", Mississippi Genealogy, 2002-2008, webpage: [http://www.mississippigenealogy.com/history/fort_maurepas.htm Mgenealogy-maurepas]. de l'√âpinay and de Bienville decided to make use of the harbor at Ship Island. They ordered a new fort to be constructed on the mainland opposite, selecting a place one league west of Old Biloxi for a site across Biloxi Bay. The transport ship Dauphine, commanded by M. Berranger, had arrived with many carpenters and masons. They built the new fort, known as New Biloxi (Nouveau-Biloxi) and also as Fort Louis. In 1719, Fort Maurepas (at Old Biloxi) was burned; it was never reconstructed by the French. Another fort and magazines were also constructed on Ship Island, in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1719, the administrative capital of French Louisiana was moved to Old Biloxi from Mobile (or Mobille), during the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718‚Äì1720) against Spain. Due to hurricanes and shifting sand bars blocking harbor waters during the early 18th century, the capital of French Louisiana was moved from Mobile to Nouveau-Biloxi (present-day Biloxi), across Biloxi Bay. However, later in the same year, Fort Maurepas (at Old Biloxi) burned. It was never reconstructed. Later, during June‚ÄìAugust 1722, the capital was moved again, by colonial governor Bienville, from Biloxi to deeper waters in the Mississippi River at a new inland harbor town named La Nouvelle-Orl√©ans (New Orleans), built for the purpose during 1718-1722. In modern times, a replica of Fort Maurepas was built at the site, then within the town of Ocean Springs, Mississippi. It was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, when all coastal areas of Mississippi were devastated by a storm tide exceeding 30 feet (9 m), with waves even higher. =During Hurricane Katrina= A replica of the wooden Fort Maurepas was built at the historic site in the 20th century and was open to the public. It was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, when coastal Mississippi was devastated by a storm surge exceeding 30 feet (9 m) plus higher waves. Within a few hours, all coastal towns were flooded more than 90%. Residents who had not evacuated, survived by swimming to treetops or roof lines of taller buildings. A park has since been constructed at the site of the fort. It includes a playground, a splash pad, a stage, a two-story structure with a viewing platform overlooking the beach, public restrooms, and an eco-friendly parking lot. The construction included improvements of pathways along the beach, and to the sailors memorial, crosswalks, and fire pits. It provides access to parking on the opposite side of the Biloxi Bay Bridge. Problems in source documents Blueprint of Fort Maurepas Historical documents, reports and translated journals about Fort Maurepas sometimes contain conflicting dates, or other details. They were records of what people knew, and their understanding of time and context was limited. Often, such writings compress events to simplify the overall view. In summary, the French claim to La Louisiane (in New France) began at Fort Maurepas in 1699, moved to Mobile in 1702 (relocated in 1711), and returned to Fort Maurepas (Old Biloxi) in 1719. The main garrison moved to the fort at (New) Biloxi, then to New Orleans during June‚ÄìAugust 1722. Several source documents sometimes state \\"1723\\" for the founding of New Orleans as the capital, but this was in fact its first full-year as capital. The name Alabama (after a Native American tribe) was used by the French colonists as one of the nine military districts of the Province of Louisiana (in 1752): Biloxi, Natchez, Yazoo, Alabama, Mobile, New Orleans, Illinois, Arkansas and Natchitoches (French names of military districts; all but two were named after local Native American tribes).

H. Bergendahl (1968) Principal gold-Producing Districts of the United States, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 610, p.143. Gold discoveries in Colorado began around Denver; prospectors traced the placer gold to its source in the mountains west of Denver, then followed the Colorado Mineral Belt in a southwest direction across the state to its terminus in the San Juan Mountains. The Cripple Creek district, far from the mineral belt, was one of the last gold districts to be discovered and is still in production. Denver-area placers Clear Creek in Arvada. On June 22, 1850, a wagon train bound for California crossed the South Platte River just north of the confluence with Clear Creek and followed Clear Creek west for . Lewis Ralston dipped his gold pan into a stream flowing into Clear Creek and found about a quarter of a troy ounce (worth almost $5, equivalent to $ today) in his first pan. John Lowery Brown, who kept a diary of the party's journey from Georgia to California, wrote on that day: \\"Lay bye. Gold found.\\" In a notation above the entry, he wrote, \\"We called this Ralston's Creek because a man of that name found gold here.\\" Ralston continued to California, but returned to 'Ralston's Creek' with the Green Russell party eight years later. Members of this party founded Auraria (later absorbed into Denver City) in 1858 and touched off the gold rush to the Rockies. The confluence of Clear Creek and Ralston Creek, the site of Colorado's first gold discovery, is now in Arvada, Colorado.Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, A gold discovery in 1858 in the vicinity of present-day Denver sparked the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. In 1858, prospectors focused on the placers east of the mountains in the sands of Cherry Creek, Clear Creek, and the South Platte River. However, the placer deposits on the plains were small, and when the first rich discoveries were made in early 1859 in the mountains farther west, the miners abandoned the placers around Denver. Although the economic portions of the gold placers around Denver were quickly exhausted, producers of construction aggregate in the area sometimes recover small amounts of gold from their sand and gravel washing. The plains counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, Denver, Elbert and Jefferson are each credited with having produced small amounts of gold.Ben H.

Central City-Idaho Springs district Chinese-American miners in the Colorado School of Mines' Edgar Experimental Mine near Idaho Springs, circa 1920. On January 5, 1859, during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush, prospector George A. Jackson discovered placer gold at the present site of Idaho Springs, where Chicago Creek empties into Clear Creek. It was the first substantial gold discovery in Colorado. Jackson, a Missouri native with experience in the California gold fields, was drawn to the area by clouds of steam rising from some nearby hot springs. Jackson kept his find secret for several months, but after he paid for some supplies with gold dust, others rushed to Jackson's diggings. The settlement was later renamed Idaho Springs, after the hot springs.Robert L. Brown (1985) The Great Pikes Peak Gold Rush, Caldwell, Ida.: Caxton, p.26-32. In May 1859, John H.

Hardrock mining boomed for a few years, but then declined in the mid-1860s as the miners exhausted the shallow parts of the veins that contained free gold and found that their amalgamation mills could not recover gold from the deeper sulfide ores.A. H. Koschman and M. H. Bergendahl (1968) Principal Gold-Producing Districts of the United States, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 610, p.86. Nathaniel P. Hill built Colorado's first successful ore smelter in Blackhawk in 1868. Hill's smelter could recover gold from the sulfide ores, an achievement that saved hardrock mining in the district. Other smelters were built nearby. Through 1959, the district produced about , mostly from sulfide veins in gneiss and granodiorite. The early gold discoveries were at the northeast end of the Colorado Mineral Belt, a large alignment of mineral deposits that stretches northeast-southwest across the mountainous part of Colorado. From Idaho Springs, prospectors followed the Colorado Mineral Belt west along Clear Creek, then over the mountain passes to South Park and to the headwaters of the Blue River. Breckenridge district Remains of the Swan River gold dredge, 2007. Placer gold was discovered in the Breckenridge, or Blue River district, in 1859 at Gold Run by the Weaver Brothers, at Georgia, American, French, and Humbug Gulches on the Swan River, on the Blue River itself, and at the confluence of French Gulch and the Blue River. Harry Farncomb found the source of the French Gulch placer gold on Farncomb Hill in 1878. His strike, Wire Patch, consisted of alluvial gold in wire, leaf and crystalline forms. By 1880, he owned the hill. Farncomb later discovered a gold vein, which became the Wire Patch Mine. Other vein discoveries included Ontario, Key West, Boss, Fountain, and Gold Flake. Lode deposits were developed in the 1880s, as prospectors followed the gold to its source veins in the hills. Gold in some upper gravel benches north of the Blue River was recovered by hydraulic mining. Gold production decreased in the late 1800s, but revived in 1908 by gold dredging operations along the Blue River and Swan River. The Breckenridge mining district is credited with production of about of gold.A. H. Koschman and M. H. Bergendahl (1968) Principal Gold-Producing Districts of the United States. US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 610, p.116-117. The gold mines around Breckenridge are all shut down, although some are open to tourist visits. The characteristic gravel ridges left by the gold dredges can still be seen along the Blue River and Snake River, and the remains of a dredge are still afloat in a pond off the Swan River. South Park districts South Platte Dredging Co., Dredge No. 1 or the Fairplay Dredge. This bucketline gold dredge operated from 1941 until 1951. Capable of excavating 15,000 cubic yards of gravel per day, it produced 9,000 ounces of gold in its first year of operation, and a total of 120,000 ounces before dismantlement. Prospectors discovered rich placer deposits on the west side of South Park in 1859. The deposits were in valleys on the east side of the Mosquito Range. The principal districts were the Alma-Fairplay district on the headwaters of the South Platte River, and the Tarryall district along Tarryall Creek northwest of Como, Colorado. Important lode gold deposits were later discovered above Alma. A floating dredge worked the floor of the South Park valley east of Fairplay from 1941 to 1952, leaving the distinctive gravel ridges that can still be seen. Production from the Tarryall district was , almost all from placers. The Alma-Fairplay district produced , more than two-thirds of which came from lode deposits.A. H. Koschman and M. H. Bergendahl (1968) Principal Gold-Producing Districts of the United States, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 610, p.109-110. Leadville district The history of the Leadville district began in April 1860, with one of the richest discoveries of Colorado placer gold at California Gulch, the site of Oro City.Ben H. Parker Jr., Gold Placers of Colorado, Book 2, Colorado School of Mines Quarterly, Oct. 1974, v.69 n.4 p.17. Another rich discovery was made at McNulty Gulch along the headwaters of Tenmile Creek. The placers were exhausted within four years, but lode gold was discovered in 1868. The gold discoveries led to the discovery of the silver deposits in 1877, and the founding of the city of Leadville. The Little Johnny silver and lead mine, dating from 1879, was further developed in 1893, by John F. Campion and James Joseph Brown, which resulted in the production of large deposits of high-grade gold-copper ore. The Leadville district produced of gold, mostly as a byproduct of silver mining.Mark W. Davis and Randall K. Streufert (1990) Gold Occurrences of Colorado, Colorado Geological Survey, Resource Series 28, p.54-55. Summitville district Prospectors found placer gold in 1870 in the Wrightman Fork of the Alamosa River. Gold veins were discovered in 1871, and large-scale production started in 1875 after the construction of a mill. By 1880, the Little Annie vein helped make Summitville Colorado's largest gold producer. Over 100,000 ounces of gold were produced by 1890. Operations were continuous until 1906, then sporadic after that.Bruce Geller, Summitville, Colorado, Mining Record, 25 Feb. 1987, p.17. Gold production up to 1990 was .Mark W. Davis and Randall K. Streufert, 1990, Gold Occurrences of Colorado, Colorado Geological Survey, Resource Series 28, p.28. In 1985, Summitville Consolidated Mining Company, a subsidiary of Galactic Resources of Vancouver, British Columbia started open pit heap-leach mining at the Summitville mine. Mining ceased in 1992, and remediation started. However, Galactic Resources declared bankruptcy in December 1992, and the US Environmental Protection Agency stepped in to prevent releases of pollution from the property.Al Knight, ‚ÄòDisaster‚Äô at Summitville was after the EPA arrived, Denver Post, 28 Apr. 1996, p.1E. The EPA declared it a federal Superfund site in May 1993.US EPA: Summitville mine The total cost of environmental cleanup at the site has been estimated to be between $100 and $120 million (equivalent to between $ and $ million today).Environmental Considerations of Abandoned Mine Lands (1995) US Geological Survey, Bulletin 2220. In 1998, the general manager and the environmental manager of the mine pleaded guilty to federal pollution charges, and were each sentenced to six months probation and $20,000 fines (equivalent to $ today).Mike McPheee and Mark Eddy, Ex-mine managers sentenced, Denver Post, 19 Dec. 1998, p.4B. Sneffels-Red Mountain-Telluride district The Sneffels-Red Mountain- Telluride district, in San Miguel and Ouray counties at the southwest end of the Colorado Mineral Belt, was discovered in 1875. Thomas Walsh developed the Camp Bird Mine in 1896. The district is within and adjacent to a Tertiary volcanic caldera. Deposits are chimneys and veins in Tertiary volcanics and intrusives, and in older sedimentary rocks. Production through 1959 was of gold, as well as considerable silver, lead, and copper. Cripple Creek district Cripple Creek (Battle Mountain) Mines, 1906, red-phonolite dikes, red-basic dikes, yellow-veinsLindgren, W., and Ransome, F.L., 1906, Geology and Gold Deposits of the Cripple Creek District, Colorado, USGS Professional Paper No. 54, Washington: Government Printing Office \\"Part-time cowboy and full-time drinker\\" Robert Womack found gold float in 1879, which led him to digging countless prospecting holes in an attempt to find its lode, earning him the name \\"Crazy Bob\\". His efforts finally paid off in 1890, when he found the El Paso lode. Winfield Scott Stratton discovered what became his Portland Mine at the site of Victor. By 1893, 10,000 miners working the district produced one third of Colorado's gold output. Gold cyanidation was introduced in 1895, and used alongside chlorination in the mills for gold extraction. By 1895, half of Colorado's gold production of 660,000 ounces came from the district. In 1897, half a million Troy ounces of gold was produced, and in 1900, 900,000 troy ounces, two thirds of the US output. By 1920, 41 mines were active, and cumulative gold production was over 500 tons. Located a few miles southwest of Pike's Peak, the Cripple Creek district wasn't discovered until later in the \\"rush\\", which was known as the \\"Pike's Peak Gold Rush\\", because Pike's Peak was a landmark visible out on the plains. The towns of Cripple Creek and Victor were established to serve the mines and miners of the district. Among the principal mines were the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine at Cripple Creek and Stratton's Independence mine, at Victor, Colorado. Gold production up to 1990 was worth about US$17 billion at 2008 prices), making it the most productive gold-producing district in Colorado, and the third-most productive in the United States (after Carlin, Nevada and Lead, South Dakota). Many of the mines in the district were quite deep and difficult to drain. The almost Roosevelt Tunnel was a mine drainage tunnel dug between 1907 and 1919 below the Cripple Creek area to drain the mines and simplify ore haulage.R. L. Herrick, Roosevelt Tunnel, Mines and Minerals, Vol. XXIX, No. 9 (April, 1909), page 387.]J. E. Murphy, Tunnel Unwaters Famous Gold District, Popular Mechanics, Vol. 32, No. 5 (Nov. 1919); pages 742-743. The Cripple Creek mining district covers a Miocene volcanic caldera filled with quartz latite porphyry. The ore bodies are veins and replacement zones within the quartz latite. The ore minerals are gold and silver tellurides, with accessory fluorite. The Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company formed in 1976 as a joint venture to restart mining in the district. From 1976 to 1989, the company produced of gold by reprocessing tailings and mining two small surface deposits. The Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mining Company began the first large-scale open pit mining in the district in 1994.Keith Dyas and Jerry Marcus (1998) The Cresson project, Engineering & Mining Jour., 6/1998, p.32KK-32OO. The Cresson mine open pits are located a few miles north of Victor. Mining continues today under the ownership of Newmont Corporation, which boosted gold production from in 2014 to in 2017, and in 2019. Some miners who worked in this district died in different ways including flu, pneumonia, in the mine, at home, or suicide. A list of dead miners has been recorded in a small notebook labeled \\"Dead\\". A photocopy of the notebook is held by the Cripple Creek District Museum. Gold mining today Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine in 2006 Colorado gold production was 270,000 ounces in 1892, 660,000 ounces in 1895, peaked in 1900 at 1,400,000 ounces, and reached over one million ounces in 1916 for the last time. Gold production in 1922 was 300,000 ounces, and 200,000 ounces in 1928. The Gold Reserve Act helped increase production to 370,000 ounces in 1936. Production was 380,000 ounces, before the War Production Board limitation order L-208 stopped gold mining in 1942. Production restarted after World War II with 168,000 ounces in 1947. Gold production was 66,000 ounces in 1960 and 22,000 ounces in 1967. Production reached 37,000 ounces in 1972 and 72,000 ounces in 1978. Only one Colorado mine continues to produce gold, the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine at Victor near Colorado Springs, an open-pit heap leach operation owned by Newmont Corporation, which produced 322,000 troy ounces of gold in 2019 and reported 3.45 million troy ounces of Proven and Probable Reserves as at December 31, 2019.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies at the edge of the K√∂nigswald (forest) in the Hunsr√ºck. Almost half the municipal area is wooded. Three kilometres to the south lies Idar-Oberstein on the river Nahe. History In 1319, Herborn had its first documentary mention under the name Horbure. At that time it was held by the Waldgrave of Wildenburg. The Waldgrave held absolute power over both low and high jurisdiction. Soon, however, the Lords of Steinkallenfels and Wartenstein somehow managed to take over. Thereafter, the village belonged to them and they grouped it into the Amt of Weiden, whose fate it then shared. The Waldgraves and Rhinegraves later tried to take back at least the court jurisdiction over the village, but their attempt in 1500 led the Lords of Wartenstein to appeal to the ‚Äúold‚Äù Trier Lehnsferse, a body constituted for this purpose among others. They decided that Herborn belonged to the court district (Gericht) of Weiden. There was another claim to both low and high jurisdiction over Herborn in 1586 by Waldgrave and Rhinegrave Otto, and he tried again in 1603, taking advantage of a situation whereby the von Warsbergs had pledged the village to the Amt of Wildenburg. In neither instance, however, could he build a solid enough case for his claim. Even as late as 1685, the Metz Chambre des R√©unions was describing the question of high jurisdiction over Herborn as being disputed among the Electorate of Trier, the feudal lords of Warsberg and the Rhinegraves. Against Electoral Trier‚Äôs might, however, the Rhinegraves could not bring their claims to fruition. By the 18th century, the Warsbergs, too, no longer had any rights in the Amt of Weiden. They had been revoked by the Electorate of Trier, and the Rhinegraves‚Äô lordship extended to one subject, a man who had to bring his grain to the Fockenhauser mill to be ground. In Napoleonic times, Herborn was grouped into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Herrstein, whose fate it then shared until 1 July 1910 when it was grouped along with Veitsrodt into the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Idar-Land, which administered it until 1933. In that year, on 1 October, the B√ºrgermeisterei of Idar-Land was dissolved and Herborn was once again grouped into the B√ºrgermeisterei of Herrstein, to which it still belongs, although in the meantime, the old B√ºrgermeisterei has been restructured into a Verbandsgemeinde.Herborn‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Herborn‚Äôs mayor is Peter Remuta, and his deputies are Gerhard Dunkel and Susanne Lang.Herborn‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality‚Äôs arms might be described thus: Per pale sable a village pump with trough argent and argent a cross gules.

The Colorado uranium industry has seen booms and busts, but continues to this day. Not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate, Colorado is considered to have the third largest uranium reserves of any US state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico.J. Keller and others, Colorado, Mining Engineering, May 2006, p. 76. Uranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted a number of companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado.

There are no currently producing uranium mines in Colorado.Mark Jaffe, \\"Mine woes run deep\\", Denver Post, 4 December 2008, p. B1. Front Range province Hydrothermal uranium deposits are present through a widely spaced area in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, in Larimer, Boulder, Gilpin, Clear Creek, and Jefferson counties. The first uranium identified in the USA was pitchblende from the Wood gold mine at Central City, Colorado in 1871.F.B. Moore and C.R. Butler (1952) Pitchblende Deposits at the Wood and Calhoun Mines Central City Mining District Gilpin County, Colorado, US Geological Survey, Circular 186. Pitchblende orebodies were also discovered in the Calhoun mine, the Kirk mine, and some others. About 122,000 pounds (55 metric tons) of uranium oxide (U3O8) were shipped at irregular intervals from six gold mines in the Central City district from 1872 to about 1916.William L. Chenowith (1980) Uranium in Colorado, in Colorado Geology, Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, p. 217. The uranium boom of the late 1940s revived the search for uranium orebodies in the gold and silver mines of the Front Range. Again, uranium was produced from a number of mines, but the orebodies were small and discontinuous. Pitchblende was discovered in 1948 in the Caribou silver mine at the town of Caribou, Boulder County. A small amount of uranium ore was produced.F.B. Moore, W.S. Cavender, and E.P. Kaiser (1957) Geology and uranium deposits of the Caribou Area, Boulder County, Colorado, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1030-N. In 1949 janitor and weekend prospector Fred Schwartzwalder discovered uranium at an abandoned copper prospect in Jefferson County about northeast of Central City and north of Golden.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, Colorado Mineral Resources Board, p.349 The deposit consists of Tertiary hydrothermal veins filling fracture zones oriented predominantly NNW- SSE in gneiss, schist, and quartzite of the Precambrian Idaho Springs Formation. The chief ore mineral is pitchblende, which occurs with adularia and ankerite. Schwartzwalder could interest no one in his discovery, so he drove the first adit of the Schwartzwalder mine by himself, made the first ore shipment in 1953, and sold the mine in 1955.George R. Downs and Allan G. Bird, The Schwartzwalder uranium mine, Jefferson County, Colorado, Mountain Geologist, Oct. 1965, v.2, n.4, pp. 183‚Äì191. The Schwartzwalder mine was the source of more than 99% of the uranium produced from the Front Range province. The mine operated until 1995, producing 17 million pounds (7700 metric tons) of uranium oxide.J.W. Keller and C.J. Carroll, Colorado, Mining Engineering, May 2001, p.68. The mine is owned by General Atomics subsidiary the Cotter Corporation, which estimates that there are an additional 16 million pounds (7300 metric tons) of uranium oxide resource remaining in the mine. The Copper King mine, in Larimer County about northwest of Fort Collins and northeast of Red Feather Lakes contained a skarn deposit that was worked unsuccessfully for zinc in 1920 and 1936. Prospectors found uranium at the abandoned mine in 1949, and it was worked for uranium from 1951 until 1953. The uranium occurs as pitchblende in a hydrothermal vein deposit in Precambrian granite. Although the zinc skarn and the pitchblende vein are exposed in the same workings, the pitchblende appears to have been deposited much later.P.K. Sims, George Phair, and R.H. Moench (1958) Geology of the Copper King Uranium Mine, Larimer County, Colorado, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 1132-D. Other vein-type uranium mines in the Front Range were the Fairday A.

Uravan mineral belt Map of the Uravan Mineral Belt The Uravan mineral belt is an arcuate zone of uranium-vanadium deposits in San Miguel, Montrose, and Mesa counties, Colorado, and Grand County, Utah. It was the area most productive of uranium in the United States in the early 20th century. The mineral belt includes the Slick Rock, Gypsum Valley, Uravan, and Gateway mining districts.R.P. Fischer and L.S. Hilpert, Geology of the Uravan Mineral Belt, US Geological Survey, Bulletin 988-A. Uranium mining in southwest Colorado goes back to 1898, when a miner dug of yellow ore that tested high in uranium and vanadium out of a deposit at Roc Creek in Montrose County, Colorado, and shipped it to France, where M. M. C. Friedel and E. Cumenge identified the new mineral that they named carnotite. The mineral was mined for its vanadium, with uranium as a byproduct. Although radium had been discovered in 1898, it had been derived from pitchblende, and the radium content of carnotite was not known. Carnotite was suspected to contain radium as early as 1903, on the basis of the anomalously high radioactivity of carnotite ores.Herman Fleck and William G. Haldane, Preliminary report on the radioactivity of the carnotite of southwest Colorado, Quarterly of the Colorado School of Mines, Oct. 1909, v.4, n.3, p. 1. But it was not until 1911 that the radium content of carnotite was confirmed by the Marie Curie laboratory in Paris.A. W. Forstall (1913) Carnotite a supply of radium, in Twelfth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Mines of the State of Colorado, for the Years 1911 and 1912, p.48. Although no more than a trace of radium was present in the ore, newly discovered medical applications had made radium worth $100 per milligram (equivalent to $ per milligram today), making the radium in the carnotite ore worth much more than the vanadium or uranium. Once carnotite was known to contain radium, prospectors rushed to the Colorado Plateau of southwest Colorado and adjacent southeast Utah, and found carnotite-bearing sandstones of the Jurassic Morrison Formation in Mesa, Montrose, and San Miguel counties in Colorado. The carnotite was at first shipped to Europe for processing, but by 1913, the Standard Chemical Company had built a radium processing plant in Montrose County that had become the world's largest supplier of radium.Joseph M. Flannery (1914) Radium plant of the Standard Chemical Company, in Thirteenth Biennial Report of the Bureau of Mines of the State of Colorado, for the Years 1913 and 1914, pp. 113‚Äì116. The Uravan mineral belt of Colorado and Utah supplied about half the world's radium from 1910 to 1922, and vanadium and uranium were byproducts. The mines were forced out of business in 1923, when rich pitchblende deposits in the Belgian Congo forced down the price of radium. Mining revived in 1935 when the price of vanadium rose, and boomed after World War II when the government stockpiled uranium for nuclear weapons programs.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, State of Colorado Mineral Resources Board, pp. 330‚Äì331. The Uravan mineral belt contains what was the last producing uranium mine in the state, the Topaz Mine, part of the Sunday Complex near Uravan, Colorado, which was closed down on 18 March 2009 by then owner Denison Mines due to depressed uranium prices. Energy Fuels Inc. has applied for a permit to rehabilitate and begin pilot production at the Torbyn mine, a former uranium producer in Mesa County just east of Gateway.Energy Fuels, Inc., Tenderfoor Mesa, accessed 20 November 2009. South Park Prospectors examined copper-stained sandstone a mile south of Garo in Park County in 1903, but the copper content was too low to mine. In 1919, prospectors discovered that the sandstone contained uranium and vanadium, and about 40 tons of ore containing up to 1% uranium was mined from underground workings. The mine was reactivated as an open-pit uranium mine in 1951 and closed in 1952. The ore consisted of the uranium-vanadium minerals tyuyamunite, metatyuyamunite, and carnotite, along with the copper minerals covellite, chalcocite, azurite, and malachite, and the copper-vanadium mineral volborthite, in the Maroon Formation of Pennsylvanian-Permian age. The ore is associated with faulting-induced fractures in the sandstone.Verl R.

Uranium was discovered in outcrops of the Morrison Formation (Jurassic). Mineralization occurs in silicified (chalcedony and quartz) veins cutting the Morrison Formation and the subjacent Precambrian schist. The veins contain pitchblende, autunite and uranophane, with accessory marcasite and barite. Extraction started in 1954, by underground mining.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, Colorado Mineral Resources Board, pp. 353‚Äì357. Marshall Pass district Uranium was discovered near Marshall Pass in northern Saguache and southeastern Gunnison counties, in 1955. Although the initial discoveries were uneconomic, they attracted further prospecting, which located commercial orebodies along the Chester thrust fault of Laramide age. The deposits are about six-mile east of Sargents. The orebodies are primarily pyrite and pitchblende replacements of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks. Some uranophane and autunite are also present. Initial mining was by small open pits; underground mines were later developed.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, Colorado Mineral Resources Board, pp. 357‚Äì359. Maybell district The Maybell district in Moffat County was discovered in 1954 by an airborne radiation survey. Uranium was present as meta-autunite, uranophane, uraninite, and coffinite in tufaceous fluvial sandstones of the Miocene Browns Park Formation.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, State of Colorado Mineral Resources Board, p.343-347. Ore deposits are associated with faults, which are thought to have been pathways for reducing solutions from below. Ore was taken from numerous open-pit mines between two and three miles north of US Highway 40, between the towns of Maybell and Lay from 1953‚Äì1964 and 1976‚Äì1981. Ores were treated in a local ore mill, east-northeast of Maybell, during the 1953‚Äì1964 period; during 1976‚Äì1981, ore was heap- leached, and the eluate trucked to Wyoming for uranium recovery. Total production of the district was of uranium oxide.William L. Chenoweth (1986) Geology and Production History of the Uranium Deposits in the Maybell, Colorado, Area in, New Interpretations of Northwest Colorado Geology, Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, pp. 289‚Äì295. Tallahassee Creek Surface radioactive anomalies led to uranium discoveries in 1954 at Tallahassee Creek in Fremont County. Mining in the 1950s was by both underground and open-pit methods.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, Colorado Mineral Resources Board, pp. 359‚Äì361. Exploration in the 1970s by Cyprus Mines and Wyoming Minerals defined two orebodies: the Hansen orebody, estimated to contain 12 million pounds of U3O8, and the Picnic Tree orebody, estimated to contain 1 million pounds U3O8. Uranium is present as uraninite, coffinite, and meta-autunite in Eocene and Oligocene arkosic sandstone, conglomerate, and in sediments interbedded with Miocene volcanic flows. Uranium is associated with carbonaceous material, and pyrite. The source of uranium is thought to be the Oligocene Wall Mountain Tuff.K.A. Dickinson, \\"Geologic controls of uranium mineralization in the Tallahassee Creek uranium district, Fremont County, Colorado,\\" The Mountain Geologist, Oct. 1981, v.18, n.4, p. In December 2006, the Australian company Black Range Minerals bought rights to mine the Taylor Ranch property, which the company describes as a 30-million pound uranium orebody that had been discovered in the late 1970s, but abandoned because of low uranium prices. The company plans an extensive drilling program in 2008 to delineate the orebody.Black Range Minerals: Taylor Ranch Uranium Project, Colorado USA Denver Basin Relatively small amounts of uranium ore have been mined from the Dakota Sandstone along the western edge of the Denver Basin. The Mann mine, near Morrison, Colorado, produced 16,000 pounds (7.1 metric tons) of uranium oxide from 1955 to 1961.Robert J. Wright and Donald L. Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, Denver: Colorado Mineral Resources Board, p.363. The Mike Doyle mine in El Paso County produced 280 pounds (130 kg) of uranium oxide from Dakota sandstone in 1955. Also in 1955, a Dakota sandstone mine in Larimer County produced 8 pounds of uranium along with some vanadium.Robert M. Kirkham and L.R. Ladwig (1980) Energy Resources of the Denver and Cheyenne Basins, Colorado, Colorado Geological Survey, Environmental Geology 12, p. 131-132. The Leyden coal mine, north of Golden, Colorado, produced 4500 pounds (2.1 metric tons) of uranium oxide from 1954 to 1956, as a byproduct of coal mining in the Laramie Formation. Rancher Solomon Schlagel discovered uranium in Weld County, Colorado in 1969 when he noticed that cuttings from seismic shotholes were anomalously radioactive.Harold L. Reade (1978) Uranium deposits: Northern Denver Julesburg Basin, Colorado in Energy Resources of the Denver Basin, Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, pp. 161‚Äì171. Exploration in the 1970s defined a number of roll-front uranium deposits in the Upper Cretaceous Laramie Formation and Fox Hills Formation in Weld County. They all occur along the southern margin of the Cheyenne sub-basin of the Denver Basin. Wyoming Minerals Corporation operated a pilot in-situ leaching plant from June 1977 to May 1978, successfully extracting uranium from a deposit in the Laramie Formation near the town of Grover. The aquifer was then remediated.Robert M. Kirkham (1979) Promises & Problems of a \\"New\\" Uranium Mining Method: In Situ Solution Mining, Colorado Geological Survey, Environmental Geology 11, pp. 1, 18‚Äì19. Power Resources Corporation began in- situ mining the uranium deposit in the Fox Hills Formation at Keota, Colorado in 1980. The Keota deposit was estimated to contain 5 to 10 million pounds (2300 to 4500 metric tons) of uranium oxide, but the project was halted because of low uranium prices.Robert M. Kirkham, William O'Leary, and James W.

Powertech is currently evaluating the property for in-situ leaching using a leach solution of dissolved carbon dioxide and oxygen. The uranium occurs in a series of roll fronts in sandstones of the Fox Hills Formation aligned roughly north-south over 11 miles. A consultant for Powertech has estimated that the deposits contain identified reserves of 9.7 million pounds (4400 metric tons) of uranium oxide recoverable by in-situ and open-pit methods, with potential for another three to five million pounds.W. Cary Voss Updated Technical Report on the Centennial Uranium Project. Weld County, Colorado. (PDF). Powertech Uranium Corp. 25 February 2010. Retrieved on 19 March 2011. If all goes according to Powertech's proposed timeline, the process of obtaining government permits would extend through the end of 2009, after which the in- situ leaching would extract 800,000 pounds (360 metric tons) of uranium per year for ten years. The uranium would be stripped from the leachate using ion exchange resin. The loaded resin beads would be trucked to an off-site facility for reprocessing and precipitation of uranium concentrate. Solution mining would move progressively from north to south, with remediation following mining as each orebody is mined out. Powertech's mining plans are opposed by Coloradoans Against Resource Destruction (CARD), who point out that the Fox Hills Formation is an important water-supply aquifer.Colorado Department of Health and Environment: Permitting Status of Centennial Uranium ProjectColorado State University, Dept. of Environmental & Radiological Health Sciences: Uranium Mining and Recovery Operations Information Environmental issues Three former uranium mill sites in Colorado are current United States Environmental Protection Agency National Priorities List (Superfund) sites: * Denver Radium Site,Denver Radium Site, Superfund sites, EPA Denver * Lincoln Park,Lincoln Park, Superfund sites, EPA adjacent to the Cotter Corporation uranium mill at Canon City in Fremont County.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the Kehrbach southeast of the Idarkopf (746 m above sea level) at the edge of the Idar Forest in the Hunsr√ºck. The municipal area is 71.1% wooded. =Neighbouring municipalities= Stipshausen borders in the north on the municipality of Weitersbach, in the east on the municipality of Rhaunen, in the south on the municipality of Hottenbach, in the southwest on the municipality of Morbach and in the west on the municipality of Hochscheid. The last two named municipalities lie in the neighbouring Bernkastel-Wittlich district. =Constituent communities= Also belonging to Stipshausen are the ‚ÄúSiedlung Heck‚Äù development and the outlying homesteads of Stipshausener M√ºhle, Gerwertsm√ºhle and Lerchenm√ºhle.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Verzeichnis der Gemeinden und Gemeindeteile , Seite 21 (PDF) History =Name= At the time of Stipshausen's first documentary mention, the village's name was Stebeshusen. This changed over the centuries to Stibshusen, Steibshausen and, by 1850, Stiebshausen before settling on the current name. It seems likely that different spellings existed alongside each other at times, for although the first topographic map compiled by the Prussians in 1850 featured the spelling Stiebshausen, the Napoleonic French authorities only a few decades earlier had used the modern spelling.Stipshausen‚Äôs name =Prehistory and early history= Several barrows within municipal limits show that the area was settled quite early on. The most important archaeological finds, however, stem from Roman times. Where today the road leads out of the village ‚Äì near the playground ‚Äì once stood a villa rustica. Unearthed nearby was a Jupiter Column. =Middle Ages= In 1334, Stipshausen had its first documentary mention in a church document as Stebeshusen. In the middle of this old document is the granting of an indulgence, which apparently had something to do with the building of the new, but now vanished, Saint Anthony's Chapel. A first documentary mention nevertheless has nothing much to do with a village's actual age. A clearer indication of that is contained in the name itself. The ending ‚Äîhausen (originally ‚Äîhusen) dates the village's founding to the time about the year 1000 when the Franks were settling the land. In the Late Middle Ages, the village was made up of two centres: Stebeshusen lay on the Kehrbach's left bank and belonged to the high court region of Rhaunen, and over on the other side lay Smer(le)bach, which had its first documentary mention in 1325, and which formed together with the village of Asbach a court region of its own. Upon the 1515 partition of the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate, Smerlebach, which was also known as the court region of Stipshausen, passed to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg and thereafter belonged to the Amt of Wildenburg. Stipshauen, on the other hand, remained with the Amt and high court region of Rhaunen. The lordship was shared between the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Dhaun and the Electorate of Trier, with three-fourths to the former and one- fourth to the latter. In 1515, there were 15 families living in Stipshausen. =Modern times= Smerlebach was from 1619 to 1706 pledged to the family Schenk von Schmidtburg. It was later held as a pledged estate by the widowed Margravine Louise of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken (1686-1773). When the French reorganized the administration in the lands that they occupied in 1798, Stipshausen and Smerlebach were presumably united. In 1805, the population amounted to 206, reaching 336 by 1820. After Stipshausen passed to Prussia in 1815 as a result of the Congress of Vienna, it belonged to the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Rhaunen in the Bernkastel district, which in turn was in the Regierungsbezirk of Trier. In the village itself lived many day labourers and craftsmen, above all bricklayers. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969 and 1970, Stipshausen was grouped into the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen in the Birkenfeld district. =Ecclesiastical history= In 1334, Johann von Basenheim, Burgmann at the Schmidtburg, and his wife Getza endowed a chapel in Stipshauen. Saint Anthony's Chapel (Antonius-Kapelle) was at first tended by a rector from Rhaunen who was independent of any monastery or lordship. In 1504, Archbishop of Mainz Berthold split the chapel away from Rhaunen and raised it to parish church with all attendant rights. The right to nominate parish priests alternated between the family Schenk von Schmidtburg (later the Electorate of Trier) and the family Metzenhausen. After the Reformation had been introduced into Rhaunen in 1560, the parish priest there tended the flock at Stipshausen, preaching this new version of Christianity. The relationship was not altogether free of conflict. Indeed, in 1714, the subjects asked the Kollator (the holder of the altar benefice), Count Cratz von Scharfenstein, to be tended instead by the priest from Hottenbach. Besides the struggle between Rhaunen and Hottenbach over the priest's position at Stipshausen, the struggle between denominations, too, burdened ecclesiastical life. In the wake of the War of the Reunions, the French declared Saint Anthony's Chapel a simultaneous church in 1686. The Catholics, whose numbers had grown through marriage and migration to 20% of the population, were nonetheless only allowed to use the church for burials. Tension was relieved only in 1778 and 1779, when the Evangelical community built itself a new church on the site of the chapel, which by now had fallen into disrepair, and also gave the Catholic community land and money to build their own chapel. Saint Maternus's Chapel was finished in 1781, and replaced with a new building in 1953 and 1954. In 1819, the Prussian government in Trier ordered the merger of the Evangelical parishes of Hottenbach and Stipshausen. The parish is today independent and is part of the church district of Trier. The Catholic residents, whose share of the population has grown to 30%, belong to Saint Martin's parish in Rhaunen. =Jewish history= Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves had so-called Schutzjuden. There were major Jewish communities in Rhaunen, Laufersweiler and Hottenbach in the 18th century. In 1709, a Jewish inhabitant in Stipshausen is first mentioned. It is believed that the children attended the Jewish school in Rhaunen. About 1800, five Jewish families lived in Stipshausen, roughly 25 men, women and children. At the census in 1808, however, this had shrunk to 17 persons. In Prussian times, Stipshausen's Jewish inhabitants turned to Hottenbach for worship, for it was there in 1796 that a synagogue was built. Likewise, the Jewish children had to go there for school. In 1843 there were 32 Jews living in Stipshausen. This number, though, was steadily shrinking. After the Jewish community in Hottenbach was dissolved in 1932, the 14 Jews left in Stipshausen went to synagogue in Rhaunen. After Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), the last Jewish family left Stipshausen. All that bears witness to the former Jewish community today is the graveyard above the village. Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Stipshausen's mayor is Frank Marx, and his deputies are Manfred Witz, Frank Gr√§ber and Heidi Sauer.Stipshausen‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess Or a monster with a wolf's head and an eagle's body sans talons displayed gules, its breast charged with a cramp sable, and vert a stag's attires fixed to the scalp of the first, between which an oakleaf palewise argent.

In the past, Colorado called itself the Silver state. (Nevada also calls itself the Silver state. Idaho, however, actually produces the most silver in the US.) Central City-Idaho Springs district Silver veins were discovered in the Central City-Idaho Springs district a short time after gold was discovered there in 1859. However, mining the silver veins was delayed for the most part until smelters were built in the late 1860s. The veins of the district are zoned in a roughly concentric manner, with gold-bearing pyrite veins in the center, and silver-bearing galena veins more common in the outlying areas. Montezuma district The first silver discovery in Colorado was south of Montezuma in 1864. The discovery led to others in the Montezuma district, including those at Saints John.T. S. Lovering and E. N. Goddard (1950) Geology and Ore Deposits of the Front Range Colorado, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 223, p.123. Argentine district The discovery of silver in the Montezuma district led to the silver discovery at the Belmont lode in the Argentine district just northeast of the Montezuma district. Georgetown-Silver Plume district Prospectors found gold veins near present Georgetown in 1859. Silver, the main product from the district, was not discovered until 1864. John Henry Bowman (1850-1900) came to Silver Plume, Colorado, in 1883, then moved to Georgetown, Colorado, in 1885. A machinist, he worked as foreman of the Miners Sampling Works. Later, he was superintendent of the American Sisters Mine, a company in which he owned stock. American Sisters Mine was a consolidation of Two Sisters Mine and Native American Mine, silver mines located on Columbia Mountain in upper Clear Creek County, Colorado. In 1891-1892, John Bowman and his wife, Lavinia Potts Bowman (1848-1901) built what later became known as the Bowman/White House in Georgetown (a historical site today). There they raised two daughters, Iorria and Mary Ellen (\\"Mellie\\"). In 1899, Iorria married J.E. Carnal and moved to Ohio. For the most part, Mellie (1876-1969) stayed in the family home after she married John James (\\"J.J.\\") White (1870-1932) in 1901. She inherited half of her father's share in the American Sisters Mine and served on the Georgetown Library Association from 1911-1922. Mellie's husband, John James White, Sr., bought the remaining stock of what was now called the Two American Sisters Mine. He managed construction of a dam and power plant north of Georgetown, and built a new shaft house and mill at the mine site. White, an attorney, practiced law, served as the Police Judge and Mayor of Georgetown from 1900-1902, and was President of the Georgetown school board. The Bowman-White House still remains, and is registered as a historical site in Georgetown, Colorado.Bowman/White Family Papers, WH32, Western History Collection, The Denver Public Library. Leadville district grubstaked a pair of prospectors, and their silver discovery at Leadville turned him into a millionaire Despite the early silver discoveries, Colorado's largest silver district, Leadville, was not discovered until 1874. Leadville was the largest silver-producing district in Colorado. Cumulative production through 1963 was of silver, of gold, of lead, of zinc, and of copper.Ogden Tweto (1968) Leadville District, Colorado, in Ore Deposits of the United States 1933‚Äì1967, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.681-705 Aspen district Silver mines at Aspen, circa 1898‚Äì1905. In 1879, prospectors searching for another Leadville were led to the Aspen area by geological maps that showed outcrops of Leadville Limestone. They found silver ore on Aspen Mountain, but ore production was small until the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad reached the town in 1887 and provided economic shipment of ore to smelters. Ore occurs in the Mississippian Leadville Limestone and the lower part of the overlying Pennsylvanian Belden Formation. Ore minerals include galena, sphalerite, and native silver. Early production was almost all silver, but after 1900, lead and zinc became economically important. Major mining operations continued until 1952. Total production was 101 million troy ounces of silver, 294 tons of lead, and 11,000 tons of zinc.Bruce Bryant (1977) Mining at Aspen, in Exploration Frontiers of the Central and Southern Rockies, Denver: Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, p.451-455. Gilman district Silver was discovered in the Gilman mining district in 1878 or 1879. As the deeper sulfide ores were reached, the miners found that the ore contained so much zinc that the smelters refused to buy it. A roaster and magnetic separator were installed in 1905 to separate out the zinc minerals, turning the problem into an asset. The mining operations transitioned increasingly to zinc, although the Eagle Mine was still the leading producer of silver in the state in 1930. The New Jersey Zinc Company entered Gilman in 1912, and over a period of years purchased all the principal mines and the entire townsite. Zinc was the economic mainstay until 1931, when low zinc prices forced the company to switch to mining copper-silver ores. Production of the district through 1964 was 64 million troy ounces (1,990 metric tons) of silver, 348,000 ounces (10.82 metric tons) of gold, 578,000 metric tons of zinc, 114,000 metric tons of lead, and 92,000 metric tons of copper.R.E. Radabaugh and others (1968) Geology and ore deposits of the Gilman (Red Cliff, Battle Mountain) district, Eagle County, Colorado, in Ore Deposits in the United States 1933/1967, v.1, New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, p.641-664. Zinc production resumed in 1941, and remained the principal product of the mines until they were closed in the 1980s. Creede district The Creede district in Mineral County was discovered in 1887, but did not become a significant silver producer until 1891. The ore occurs as veins along north-south trending faults, and as replacement bodies in the Creede Formation, a Tertiary ash-flow tuff. Ore minerals are sphalerite, galena, acanthite, native silver, pyrite and chalcopyrite.Mark W. Davis and Randall K. Streufert (1990) Gold Occurrences of Colorado, Colorado Geological Survey, Resource Series 28, p.70-73. Production through 1983 totaled 80 million ounces (2,490 metric tons) of silver, 150 thousand ounces (4.7 metric tons) of gold, and considerable lead and zinc.Richard W. Robinson and David J. Norman, Mineralogy and fluid inclusion study of the southern Amethyst vein system, Creede mining district, Colorado, Economic Geology, May 1984, p.439-447. Current production The largest current source of silver in Colorado is as a byproduct of gold mining at the Cripple Creek & Victor Gold Mine, a large open-pit heap leach operation owned by Newmont Mining Corporation at Victor, Colorado (see Cripple Creek mining district). In 2006, the mine produced 4.0 metric tons (130,000 ounces) of silver.Burnell and others, Colorado, Mining Engineering, May 2007, p.76.> See also * Champion Mill * Coal mining in Colorado * Gold mining in Colorado * Silver mining * Silver mining in the United States * Uranium mining in Colorado Notes .

History Archaeological digs at several barrows within Weitersbach's limits have unearthed finely decorated ceramics, bronze weapons and pieces of jewellery. These are grave goods from the prevalent culture about the year 500 BC, when Celtic settlers of Early La T√®ne times used the favourable location on the Idarkopf's south slope as their dwelling and farming place. Finds of metal-bearing slag in the forest above the village also suggest that iron was being smelted here even in pre-Roman times. Just under 2,000 years ago, at the grove known as the Kaisergarten, where the forest road to Krummenau and the ancient trade road ‚ÄúStrut‚Äù fork away from each other, stood one of the biggest estates of Roman times in the Hunsr√ºck area. Among the buildings here, which were thoroughly excavated in 1953-1955, was the main building, a palacelike villa with a risalto, an ostentatious portico and corner turrets. This 26-room villa rustica had floor heating by hypocaust and a luxurious bathing wing with cold, lukewarm and hot baths. Near the main building stood drying ovens for grain and smoked foods: a clear hint that there were both extensive cropraising and significant livestock raising here.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies in the Hunsr√ºck, at Rhineland- Palatinate's boundary with the Saarland. The municipal area measures roughly 274 ha, and the elevation is 524 m above sea level. =Neighbouring municipalities= R√ºckweiler borders in the north on the municipality of Berglangenbach, in the east on the municipality of Rohrbach, in the southeast on the municipality of Freisen, in the southwest on the municipality of Hahnweiler and in the northwest on the municipality of Leitzweiler. R√ºckweiler also meets the municipality of Gimbweiler to the west at a single point, which is also shared with two other municipalities. All municipalities named here are in the Birkenfeld district but for Freisen, which is in the Sankt Wendel district in the Saarland. History Bearing witness to early habitation in the R√ºckweiler area are grave goods from the Iron Age going back as far as the 6th century BC. The people of the Hunsr√ºck-Eifel culture were Celtic, raised livestock, and were also already raising crops. They burnt their dead and buried them with their belongings. Their ‚Äúprinces‚Äù, however, were buried in great mounds under hefty stones. An extensive burying ground was discovered near R√ºckweiler on the western slope of the R√ºckeberg. This discovery and other burying grounds in Freisen and near Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach show that the region was already attracting settlers then. The R√ºckweiler burying ground comprised 12 graves sunk into the rock within an area of 3 000 m¬≤ at a sport field, which now no longer exists. Brought to light from these graves were handmade and thrown pots of various shapes. The way that the graves were laid out as a group suggested that the burying ground was a family plot, or perhaps one used by an estate. The graves were either elliptical or rectangular and more than a metre long. They lay as far down as 90 cm below the ground and were filled with dark earth coloured by charcoal remnants. The number of pots found in each grave varied from one to ten. For the voyage to the hereafter, some pots contained food, jewellery, items of clothing and other belongings. One peculiarity was the graves‚Äô superstructures, which had, of course, long since vanished. However, the upright posts of these structures had left dark soil where they had once been sunk into the earth. The superstructure remnants at two of the graves suggested that the superstructures might have been replicas of the dead's houses, further suggesting a Mediterranean influence from La T√®ne times. The superstructures served as remembrance to the dead and also were important in the care of the departed souls, for the builders believed that without such care, the dead were left to wander about without peace, bringing the living bad luck and harm. To ward off any such outcome, the dead were given food, drink and sacrifices. According to old documents, the R√ºckweiler area belonged in the 12th century to the Bishop of Verdun. Even the Counts of Veldenz, who as fiefholders ruled the land, named the Bishop as the actual landowner. Given this, it can easily be concluded that the whole area once belonged to a greater landhold, Tholey, which Deacon Adelgisel, known as Grimo, a great Merovingian landholder, donated to the Church of Verdun on 30 December 634. On 5 March 1332, R√ºckweiler had its first documentary mention under the name Rickwilre. In the villages of Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler, which belonged to the Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) of Rohrbach, the land was held, as it was in the neighbouring court district of Baumholder at that time, by enfeoffed lords. On the date in question, Dietrich Gauwer von Lichtenberg allocated 299 Mark Pfennige from his holdings in Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler for his wife as a dower. In 1386, Johann von Lewenstein paid Count of Veldenz Heinrich 100 Gulden (roughly equivalent to ‚Ç¨4000 or ‚Ç¨5000 in modern funds) for his villages, courts, paupers, water and meadowland at ‚ÄúRoirbach, Zingswilre und Rickwilre‚Äù along with three bondsmen outside these villages. In 1428, the Count of Veldenz awarded the court fief to the House of Winterbecher. Three years later, half of each of the two villages of Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler, along with their people, interest payments and earnings, were under Count of Sponheim Wolf's ownership. He in turn sold the rights along with other goods and sources of income for 487.5 Gulden to Count of Veldenz Friedrich. The other halves of the fiefs of Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler were held by the family Gauwer von Lichtenberg, and thereafter by Hildebrand von Boxberg. Owing to disputes between Count of Veldenz Stephan and Lord of Oberstein Wyrich von Dhaun, a judicial decision on 26 January 1440 stipulated that the Boxberg fief of Rohrbach, R√ºckweiler and W√ºrtzweiler was to be awarded in whole to the House of Veldenz. Four years later, when the House of Veldenz died out in its male line, R√ºckweiler passed to Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. In the Thirty Years' War, the region around R√ºckweiler suffered heavily. Subsequently, as a result of brutal Rhine campaigns by Louis XIV's troops in the Franco-Dutch War, in 1675 R√ºckweiler had only one family left. In French Revolution‚Äôs wake, R√ºckweiler, having formerly belonged to the Amt of Berschweiler, and for a short while to the Amt of Nohfelden, was assigned under French rule, beginning in 1793, to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Berschweiler in the canton of BaumholderR√ºckweiler‚Äôs history As such it was incorporated into the First French Empire under Napoleon. At the Congress of Vienna, R√ºckweiler was granted to Duke Ernest III of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld as part of a large estate of some 8.25 square miles, at first called the Herrschaft Baumholder; by a ducal decree of 6 March 1819, the area between Baumholder and Kusel was renamed the Principality of Lichtenberg. In 1834, however, due to political unrest and its great distance from the rest of his Duchy, Duke Ernest sold the Principality to Prussia for an annuity of 80,000 talers. Thereafter the village formed a part of the Prussian Rhine Province and from 1871 a part of the German Empire. Following the abdication of the last emperor in 1918, the province was included in the newly established Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic; in 1920 it was made part of the League of Nations protectorate known as the Saargebiet, until a plebiscite returned the territory to the German Reich in 1935. From the fall of the Reich in 1945, the area was part of the French occupied zone.

In the early stages of the war, they were the interface divisions fighting in rough terrain and foothills as well as urban areas, between the mountains and the plains. The J√§gers (meaning hunters in German) relied on a high degree of training, and slightly superior communications, as well as their considerable artillery support. In the middle stages of the war, as the standard infantry divisions were downsized, the J√§ger structure of divisions with two infantry regiments, became the standard table of organization. In 1943, Adolf Hitler declared that all infantry divisions were now Grenadier Divisions except for his elite J√§ger and Mountain Jaeger divisions. Organisation and history The division was originally formed in October 1936 in Breslau, Silesia, as the 28th Infantry Division (this lineage giving it the divisional nickname of the Eisernes Kreuz Schlesische Division, the 'Iron Cross Silesian Division'). After action in the Crimea, and taking heavy casualties in the siege of Sevastopol, it was reconstituted as the 28th Light Infantry Division in December 1941, and then as the 28th J√§ger Division in July 1942, with the following organisation: *J√§ger-Regiment 49 *J√§ger-Regiment 83 *Artillerie-Regiment 28 *Feldersatz-Battalion 28 *Pionier-Battalion 28 *Panzerj√§ger-Abteilung 28 *Aufkl√§rungs-Abteilung 28 *Divisions-Einheiten 28 The 28th J√§ger Division fought largely on the Leningrad front, as part of Army Group North. In July 1944 it participated in the unsuccessful attempt to break the encirclement of Fourth Army east of Minsk during Operation Bagration. In late 1944 and early 1945 it fought in East Prussia with the rebuilt Fourth Army, being largely destroyed or captured in the Heiligenbeil Pocket. After absorbing some elements of the destroyed 102nd Infantry Division the remainder surrendered to the Soviets in Samland. Commanding officers =28.

In the early 13th century, Veitsrodt had its first documentary mention in a directory of fiefs kept by Saint Maximin's Abbey in Trier. The village was then known simply as Rodt, which was descriptive of how it had arisen, namely as a clearing (Modern High German: Rodung) in the forest. Veit meant the same as Vogt (‚Äúreeve‚Äù), and it can therefore easily be assumed that the village's name stemmed from the Waldgravial V√∂gte (the plural of Vogt) within whose administrative holdings Veitsrodt found itself for centuries. On the other hand, the church in Veitsrodt was consecrated to Saint Vitus (called Veit in German), which would mean that the name meant ‚ÄúVitus‚Äôs Clearing‚Äù. Saint Maximin's Abbey held the church patronage rights and the tithes in Veitsrodt at the beginning of the 13th century. Whatever the name's origins, it is clear that by the time of first documentary mention, the village had already existed for quite some time. In 1319, Raide found itself under the lordship of the Waldgraves of Kyrburg. In a 1375 partition agreement, it was named as Rode. Enfeoffment documents from 1434 referred to it as Vogtei des Hofes Raide (Vogtei meant a reeve's office or responsibilities; des Hofes is genitive for der Hof, meaning ‚Äúthe estate‚Äù) Beginning in the late 15th century, the village was called by its modern name, Veitsrodt. Also from this time on, it always belonged to the Amt of Wildenburg, until French Revolutionary/Napoleonic times. For centuries, Veitsrodt had a Schulthei√ü and a clergyman. In 1798, Veitsrodt was grouped by the French occupational authorities into the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Herrstein in the canton of Herrstein. After Napoleon‚Äôs downfall and the Congress of Vienna, Veitsrodt became German again, but still remained in the same mayoralty, now known as the B√ºrgermeisterei of Herrstein. In 1815 the village passed to Prussia and in 1817 to the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea. From 1910 to 1933 it belonged to the B√ºrgermeisterei of Idar-Land, before being transferred back to the Mayoralty (now called Amtsb√ºrgermeisterei) of Herrstein. Judicially, Veitsrodt belonged to the Wildenburg high court. Veitsrodt itself formed a court district within this high court district at which the Rhinegraves were the low and high justices. According to the 1514 Weistum (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) of Vitrirode, three yearly things were to be held: the first on the Tuesday after the Schurer Kirbe (the fair in nearby Schauren, three weeks after Christmas); the second on the Tuesday after Walpurgis Night; the third on the Tuesday after Saint Bartholomew's Night. Dates and times for these meetings were not announced, so well known were they.http://veitsrodt.de/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=3&Itemid;=13 =Schinderhannes= Living in the village from 1795 to 1798 was the family of the notorious outlaw Johannes B√ºckler, commonly known as Schinderhannes. B√ºckler's father Johann worked as a field ranger and a day labourer. Schinderhannes lived with his family, at least in the earlier part of this time. He sometimes ran errands for the landlord, Mr. Koch from Veitsrodt. On 16 September 1798, Joseph B√ºckler, Schinderhannes's younger brother, was confirmed in Veitsrodt.

From 1804 to 1811, Friedrich Christian Laukhard was the pastor here, and during his time in Veitsrodt, he set some of his works to paper. The church also has a bell more than 500 years old, which came through both world wars without being seized and melted down. =Market= In Veitsrodt, markets, especially cattle markets, have been being held for more than 500 years. Bearing witness to this are two charges in the civic coat of arms, a bull's head and a pair of clasped hands, symbolizing agreement on a deal. For 175 years now, the market has borne the name Veitsrodter Pr√§mienmarkt. On the second weekend in July, it is held on the market lands near Veitsrodt. Offered each year is a broad array of merchandise at over 300 market stalls. Economy and infrastructure =Transport= Veitsrodt has two bus stops. While one is right in the village, the other one, Veitsrodt Markt (the outlying marketplace mentioned above), is to be found just under a kilometre from the village. Routes 346 and 351 stop in Veitsrodt. The termini are Herrstein/Wickenrodt and Rhaunen/Frankfurt-Hahn Airport respectively. German Gem Road The Deutsche Edelsteinstra√üe (‚ÄúGerman Gem Road‚Äù) runs straight through the village. In 1971, the German Gem Road's ‚Äústone guestbook‚Äù was laid out. This is a hiking trail edged with selected boulders from a nearby quarry.

History There was clearly a Roman presence in what is now Oberkirn, for the Evangelical church on the village's upper outskirts is built on the foundations of an old Roman villa rustica. The plain, Gothic church itself was built a few years before 1400 and houses the graves of the Schenken (roughly ‚ÄúStewards‚Äù) at Schmidtburg, a sideline of that great comital dynasty from the Hahnenbach valley.Oberkirn‚Äôs ancient history In 1335, Oberkirn had its first documentary mention as Overkehr. A legend has it that Oberkirn was once named Oberhausen, and that Oberhausen bei Kirn was then known as Oberkirn. Sometime over the course of the centuries, it is said, the two village's names were confused, and thereby exchanged, in a document. However, there is no scientific proof for this. Slate was long quarried within Oberkirn's municipal limits, first for building houses and then, beginning in the 19th century until the 1960s for making roof slates. Most men in the village earned their livelihood at the pits, and then also worked the land as well. When cheaper artificial slates appeared on the market, the slate pits went out of business, the last one closing in 1966.

According to a 16th-century record, Oberkirn belonged to the Amt of Schmidtburg.

Its name was Rummersberg then, and later Rymsberg. In the years after 1465, there were 15 families living in Rimsberg, but after the Thirty Years' War, only one family was left. The houses were deserted and bare, plundered by Spanish troops, and the fields, too, were bare, for nobody was there to work them now. From 1665 to 1792, the village's name was Reinsberg, and until the late 18th century, it belonged to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim. After this, the village was under French rule until 1830. At this time, Rimsberg was called Rimsbach. It was during the time of French rule that the notorious outlaw Johannes B√ºckler (1777‚Äì1803), commonly known as Schinderhannes, brought fear and dread to this part of Germany. Merchants with freight carts were ambushed in the woods by Schinderhannes's band of robbers and had everything stolen. In the end, though, Schinderhannes, together with his band, were caught, and in 1803 they were beheaded in Mainz by the French. In 1835, the school was built. Shortly thereafter a fountain was installed in the garden and the school was given a bell. It was also about this time that a graveyard was laid out, which ended the practice of Rimsberg burying its dead in Nohen. Before the school was built, classes were taught at people's houses. According to the school chronicle, classes were taught at the school building from 1796 to 1966, when the school was closed. It has since become a community centre. From 1750 to 1865, many families from Rimsberg emigrated. Two brothers with the surname Nagel went to Brazil to try their luck in 1835 after the agate pits began to become depleted. In 1865, a widow named Roth left for the United States in 1865 with her five children. Other families went to Hungary, Romania and Algeria. On 31 July 1896, Rimsberg was struck by a heavy storm whose hail wiped the local farmers‚Äô crops right out. Some houses lost their roofs, too. By contrast, the summers of 1911 and 1921 were so dry that there was a dearth of livestock fodder. Many young men from Rimsberg lost their lives in France and Russia in the First World War. Much the same befell the village in the Second World War. Those from Rimsberg who fell or went missing now have their names on a memorial plaque at the old school. Rimsberg was long a purely agricultural village. After 1945 only four farming families were left, all of whom worked the land as a secondary occupation. Until 1950, it was still done the time-honoured way, with oxen, cows and horses. Only then was work eased somewhat by tractors and threshing machines. In 1964, the village's first combine harvester was brought into service. In 1959, farming began on a rapid decline until in 2000, there were only four families who still worked the land. Some of the forsaken farmland, however, has been sold or let to those who still earn their livelihoods in agriculture. In 1931 and 1932, Rimsberg's watermain was completed, having been dug by hand. A smith from Birkenfeld named Weirich had set up a field smithy at the works to sharpen pickaxes and chisels. The field smithy was constantly at work with workers bringing their blunted tools to be sharpened. When the workers came up against particularly big or hard rocks, an explosives expert from Saarbr√ºcken was standing by specially. The waterpipes themselves were sealed using pieces of tar and molten lead. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, men from the Wehrmacht were stationed in Rimsberg. The winter that year was also bitterly cold. One night there came a loud bang as the water pressure canister at the pumphouse flew through the pumphouse roof, landing 15 m away from the pumphouse in the bushes on Bornwieserweg. The pressure had apparently built up to dangerous levels. For a week, Rimsbergers were forced to return to their old well while the Wehrmacht officer in the village saw to it that the piece of equipment in question was repaired and set back in its former place. In the 1960s, the volunteer fire brigade was founded. At first, it was rather primitively equipped, with a small, portable pumping unit, although eventually a fire engine with modern firefighting equipment was acquired, necessitating an expansion of fire station facilities. In 1970, the old pond was dredged and equipped to be a fire pond. The local fire brigade has won many prizes at contests within the Birkenfeld district for its speediness.Rimsberg‚Äôs chronicle, Part 1 Rimsberg‚Äôs chronicle, Part 2 Rimsberg‚Äôs chronicle, Part 3 Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Rimsberg's mayor is Werner Schmitt.

Among other grave goods was a coin from Emperor Antoninus Pius‚Äôs time (ruled AD 138-161). Furthermore, near the village stand three ruins from Roman times or somewhat later. These are called die Schanze am Schneidberg (‚Äúthe redoubt on the Schneidberg‚Äù), das alte Schlo√ü (‚Äúthe old palatial castle‚Äù) and das Franzosenlager (‚Äúthe Frenchman‚Äôs camp‚Äù or ‚Äúlair‚Äù). In 1037, Langweiler had its first documentary mention as Habschied. In 1237, the name lange willere cropped up for the first time in official deeds, and the form langewillre appeared in 1279. In feudal times the village belonged to the Amt of Allenbach in the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim. The village arose in the Habschied wooded district, which is why names for the village such as Habscheid, Habescheid or Habschied sometimes also crop up in old documents. The name was still in use as late as 1730. In the Middle Ages, the village's field area was made up of five Hufen (roughly ‚Äúoxgangs‚Äù), which were held by five farmers under a Schulthei√ü. The five Hufen were subject to payment of the Besthaupt (‚Äúbest head‚Äù, that is, best head of cattle) from a serf's estate upon his death to the lord. This levy was later changed to a payment in money, namely 10 Gulden to the Kellerei (feudal administration) of the Amt in Allenbach. There must however also have been at least one Waldgravial subject in the village. In 1515, this was a man named Vix Henne; he had to pay two capons yearly to the Amt of Wildenburg. The Counts of Sponheim, though, exercised both high and low jurisdiction. The dwellers of the forest region must either not have particularly liked living there and moved elsewhere, or have been compelled by sickness or other misfortune to leave their homes. This might explain the disappearance of Balsbach near Kempfeld, for instance. Nevertheless, when the Thirty Years' War laid waste to so many villages, people once again fled back into the forests. In this time, scattered soldiers and refugees in the Idar Forest supposedly built themselves cabins near Langweiler, H√ºttgeswasen and Tranenweier, among other places, and eked out their livelihoods as lumberjacks, charcoal makers, basket weavers and so on. Thus arose the new Langweiler. In censuses between 1607 and 1699, Langweiler was listed as having no inhabitants, but by 1772, there were once again 13 families who were Sponheim subjects. As subjects who were bound by oath to the Counts of Sponheim, they had free use of the Habschied woods for however many beechnuts they needed for their household swine. The children's home mentioned above was built by the town of Oberhausen and used as a convalescent home for the town's children. After the Second World War, the house changed hands and now belongs to a Catholic women's order, which runs it as a home for the elderly and an orphanage. After the Second World War, the village was part of the municipality of Wirschweiler, whose council decided in 1965 to abolish the arrangement and split the double municipality into two. The decision was overturned in the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969, but then Langweiler was amalgamated with another municipality, Sensweiler. On 1 January 1992, Langweiler finally became a separate, self-administering municipality. Because Langweiler is mainly Catholic, it has been given its own parish.Langweiler‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Langweiler's mayor, since 1992, is Alfred Reicherts.Langweiler‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: Schild, durch ein schmales, wei√ües Kreuz in vier Fl√§chen aufgeteilt. Das linke-obere, sowie das rechte- untere Viertel sind rot-silber geschachtelt. Im oberen-rechten Viertel ist auf goldenem Grund ein schwarzes Gef√§√ü, im unteren-linken ein brennender Kohlenmeiler auf goldenem Grund dargestellt. The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Quarterly, first and fourth chequy of nine gules and argent, second Or a baptismal font ensigned with a cross sable and third Or a charcoal kiln with fire and smoke proper. The German blazon speaks of a ‚Äúnarrow, white cross‚Äù separating the arms into its ‚Äúquarterly‚Äù division, but this is not in evidence in any execution of the arms available on the Internet, including the one on the municipality's own website. The writer has also reverses left and right in the blazon, for these are always told from the armsbearer's point of view in heraldry, never the viewer's. The two ‚Äúchequy‚Äù fields are a reference to the village's former allegiance to the ‚ÄúHinder‚Äù County of Sponheim. The charge in dexter base, the cutaway view of a charcoal kiln, refers to Langweiler's more recent history after the Thirty Years' War; Langweiler was then said to be the village of charcoal makers and lumberjacks. The charge in sinister chief is an old baptismal font, named in the German blazon simply as a Gef√§√ü (‚Äúvessel‚Äù). This once stood in the local church, and is about 150 cm tall. It can now be found standing in the local graveyard. During restoration work on the Haus Marienh√∂h, an old armorial stone was found in the main building's outer wall. The arms shown thereon have the same arrangement of two chequy fields as the municipal arms. The arms were designed by Michael Franz from Herrstein.Description and explanation of Langweiler‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Saint Nicetius‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Nicetius), Roter Weg ‚Äì aisleless church with ridge turret, 1856 * Warriors‚Äô memorial, northwest of the village ‚Äì terraces, stairway, small chapel, 1921-1931, design by Pastor Nikolaus Philipp A further site worth seeing is the restored Marienh√∂h Monastery, which nowadays houses a four-star hotel. =Regular events= Traditionally held every three years in Langweiler is the K√∂hlerfest, or Charcoal Makers‚Äô Festival, with its craft and farmer's market.

Detailed History  This regiment originally rendezvoused at Anna, Union County, May 16, 1861, for the 9th Congressional District, under the \\"Ten Regiment Bill.\\" On May 19 it was mustered into the state service for 30 days, by Ulysses S. Grant, then state mustering officer, and was on the 28th of the same month mustered into the U. S. service for three years. On June 24 it was moved to Bird's Point, Mo., where it remained, drilling, doing guard duty, working on fortifications, removing railroad buildings and track to keep the same from falling into the river, making new roads, etc., until Aug. 5, when it was moved into the swamp 8 miles west on the line of the Chicago & Fulton Railroad to guard it and protect workmen making repairs. On Nov. 3 it formed part of a force which was sent to Bloomfield, Mo., to rout Jeff. Thompson and his band, which was accomplished. On Feb. 6, 1862, it was in the advance in Gen. Oglesby's brigade at the capture of Fort Henry and was one of the first to enter the fort, but too late to meet the Confederates, who had flown. At Fort Donelson it occupied the right of Oglesby's brigade, on the right of the line of battle, and during the second day's fight lost 200 men in killed and wounded. 50 dying upon the field and 10 soon afterward. The regiment during the battle bravely and persistently maintained the position to which it was assigned in the early morning, and not until its ammunition was spent was the order to retire given. Its place that eventful morning was one commanding the road from the fort by which the Confederates essayed to escape, which daring attempt, however, was most signally frustrated by Oglesby's dauntless brigade. The regiment became early engaged in the battle of Shiloh, where the fight was fast became early engaged in the battle of Shiloh, where the fight was fast and furious. At the commencement of the battle the regiment had for duty 435 officers and men. The loss on the 6th was 10 killed, 63 wounded and 2 missing, but none were injured on the second day. The 3 color bearers who carried the flag in the first day's conflict were all killed while supporting the banner. The regiment was with the Army of the Tennessee during the advance upon Corinth, serving in a brigade commanded by Col. Lawler, in McClernand's division. On Nov. 28, 1862, one-half the period for which the regiment was mustered into service having expired, a statement was made showing that the original strength of officers and men, with the addition of new recruits, aggregated 1,166, and the regiment had lost through all causes 456, leaving a total aggregate on the rolls of 710. On Dec. 20 the regiment, with other forces, was marched out towards Lexington and Trenton to intercept the Confederates in a raid then being made against Union troops guarding the railroads, etc., and on Dec. 31 Cos. E and H were engaged in a fight with the Confederates under Forrest near Lexington, driving the enemy with considerable loss. On April 1, 1863, the regiment (250 mounted men) was moved toward Bolivar, Whiteville and beyond on the hunt of guerrillas and other Confederates said to be infesting the neighborhood, and a brush was had with a party posted in the road, the enemy being driven towards Danceyville, the regiment capturing some prisoners and horses. On April 11 it was ordered to Summerville, Tenn., where it investigated the place and surrounding country, routing guerrillas and securing a few prisoners. On June 4 the aggregate of the regiment, rank and file, was 369 on hand for duty, not including the teamsters, men in hospital and those absent on other service, but on July 27 the aggregate strength of those present and absent was 553, many of them being sick in hospital. On Aug. 31 the regiment was mustered and found to be so much reduced by sickness that less than 200 remained for duty, but on Sept. 11 those who were able advanced with the forces toward Little Rock, Ark., driving the enemy on both sides of the river and taking possession of the intrenchments and the city the same day. Soon after May 28, 1864, when the term of service of those originally mustered in expired, they were mustered out and the veterans and recruits were retained in the service until Dec. 16, 1865. Total strength and casualties The regiment suffered 6 officers and 99 enlisted men who were killed in action or who died of their wounds and 7 officers and 282 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 394 fatalities.http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unilinf2.htm#18th The Civil War Archive website after Dyer, Frederick Henry.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Baumholder, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on the like-named Rohrbach south of the Nahe at the foot of the 548.5 m-high W√ºschberg. =Neighbouring municipalities= Rohrbach borders in the north on the municipality of Berglangenbach, in the east on the municipalities of Fohren-Linden and Berschweiler bei Baumholder, in the south on the municipality of Freisen in the Saarland and in the west on the municipality of R√ºckweiler. History =Names= The villages of Rohrbach, R√ºckweiler, Hahnweiler and Leitzweiler bear the tag Auf der Heide, although it is unclear why this is so. As in English, the words for ‚Äúheath‚Äù, ‚Äúheather‚Äù and ‚Äúheathen‚Äù are similar to each other in German. Since Heidekraut (‚Äúheather‚Äù) was formerly written with an A in second position, doubt has arisen about that theory of the name's origin. It could also refer to Heiden (‚Äúheathens‚Äù). Nevertheless, the former theory is the likelier of the two, for the German word Heide formerly described a treeless, wild-growing area (as the English word ‚Äúheath‚Äù still does). Rohrbach's own name seems to have sprung from the bulrushes (Rohrkolben in German) and reeds (Schilfrohr) that once grew in abundance along the brook (Bach). These gave the brook its name, Rohrbach. This theory is easy to believe, for the lower valley of the Rohrbach is quite marshy and boggy, with soil in which such plants easily take root and grow. Later, the village was named after the brook. =Roman times= It can be said that Rohrbach does not find itself in the historical foreground, but on the other hand, there was a Roman settlement here, or somewhere nearby. Witnessing this are a number of archaeological finds of things such as gold and silver Roman coins and grave urns, which have been unearthed in the village during building work and in the local fields during digging. Iron Age cremation graves have also been found nearby in neighbouring municipalities. In the cadastral area known as Kr√§mel, it is said that a Roman army long encamped. Another cadastral area nearby, R√∂merm√§uerchen, whose name means ‚ÄúLittle Roman Wall‚Äù, further recalls a Roman past. =Middle Ages= When Rohrbach was founded is something that research has not yielded. Under Frankish rule, the land was carved up into Gaue, with each headed by a Gaugraf (Gau count). Rohrbach belonged, together with the other ‚Äúheath‚Äù villages, to the Moselgau. Under the Carolingians and Salians, the fiefdom developed. The villages of the Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) of Rohrbach had documentary mentions in 1428, 1431 and 1440. Belonging to this Pflege were Rohrbach, R√ºckweiler and Leitzweiler, while Hahnweiler and Wolfersweiler were affiliated. In 1586, the Pflege was in the Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken Oberamt of Lichtenberg. Each year, the Sch√∂ffe (roughly ‚Äúlay jurist‚Äù) was obliged to gather in the taxes and fines from the subjects and send them to his superior, the Amtsschulthei√ü in Berschweiler, or to the Oberamt at Castle Lichtenberg. Moreover, from time to time, he had to render certain official services, for example at executions. His remuneration was very slight, given the low population at the time, which amounted to some 115 persons. In 1112, Gerlach, who was Count of the Nahegau Emich's son, founded the County of Veldenz. In 1214, Count Gerlach IV founded Castle Lichtenberg. Count Gerlach V received from the Bishop of Verdun the Schirmvogtei (roughly ‚Äúblanket bailiwick‚Äù) over the Amt of Wolfersweiler, to which Rohrbach, among other places, belonged. Shortly thereafter, however, he had to forgo the greater part of his new acquisition, but Wolfersweiler, along with Rohrbach, the Count of Veldenz managed to keep. In 1386, Johann von Lewenstein paid Count of Veldenz Heinrich 100 Gulden (roughly equivalent to ‚Ç¨4000 or ‚Ç¨5000 in modern funds) for his villages, courts, paupers, water and meadowland at ‚ÄúRoirbach, Zingswilre und Rickwilre‚Äù along with three bondsmen outside these villages. In 1428, the Count of Veldenz awarded the court fief to the House of Winterbecher. Three years later, half of each of the two villages of Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler, along with their people, interest payments and earnings, were under Count of Sponheim Wolf's ownership. He in turn sold the rights along with other goods and sources of income for almost 500 Gulden to Count of Veldenz Friedrich. The other halves of the fiefs of Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler were held by the family Gauwer von Lichtenberg, and thereafter by Hildebrand von Boxberg. Owing to disputes between Count of Veldenz Stephan and Lord of Oberstein Wyrich von Dhaun, a judicial decision on 26 January 1440 stipulated that the Boxberg fief of Rohrbach, R√ºckweiler and W√ºrtzweiler was to be awarded in whole to the House of Veldenz. In 1444, the House of Veldenz died out in its male line. There was a daughter left, Anna. She wed Count Palatine Stephan von Zweibr√ºcken. Thus, ownership of the former Veldenz holdings, including Rohrbach, passed in whole to Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. During this time, Rohrbach belonged to the Amt of Nohfelden and the Oberamt of Lichtenberg. According to the 1477 Lichtenberg taxation book, levies for the Rohrbach court district payable to the lord amounted to 11.5 Malter of corn (it is not specified which grain this was), 23 Malter of oats and 12 Kappen. A Malter was something between 80 and 90 kg, while a Kappe was a small measure). On 15 October 1571, Count Palatine Johann, in his own, his brother Wilhelm's and his cousin Ruprecht's names, enfeoffed Wolfgang Blick von Lichtenberg with the Veldenz fief, which his parents had owned after Boxberg's death, together with, among other things, shares in the villages of Rohrbach and R√ºckweiler and tithing rights in Rohrbach. In 1580 and 1581, Duke Johannes I had some silver prospecting undertaken at ‚ÄúMichaels-Bergwerk‚Äù (‚ÄúMichael‚Äôs Mine‚Äù) near Rohrbach, to ease his subjects‚Äô poverty. The idea had to be given up, though, as it turned out there was no silver deposit. The village's poverty became all the more apparent a few years later, in 1586, when Rohrbach and Freisen were assigned a shared plot of meadowland measuring 150 Morgen: the village could not afford its share of the herdsman's wages. So, livestock from outside was also allowed to use the meadow, and the Brothers B√∂schhan, butchers from Baumholder, were given leave to graze their herd there, too. In 1620, at the Schaumburg Amtmann‚Äôs instigation, 74 sheep were pledged by the people of Freisen to the Brothers B√∂schhan. The Lorrainian Lord of Eberstein assigned the debt to the people of Rohrbach, because they had supposedly breached Lorrainian national custom. After the Brothers B√∂schhan had redeemed the herd at high cost, the Lord of Eberstein was satisfied. On 5 October 1620, the Schulthei√ü of Baumholder, named Eichhorn, issued a report about Rohrbach to the Oberamt in connection with the above dispute over the sheep-pledging arrangement. Among other things, he characterized the village as being very run down. Before he had become Schulthei√ü, most of the houses had been allowed to fall into disrepair. The smithy owner, Hans Storrer, was singled out for not only letting his own house go to rack and ruin, but also for tearing empty buildings apart to sell beams and other building materials to outsiders. Eichhorn's report ended with a request that the authorities grant him building wood so that he might build the village back up. =Early modern times= In 1675, after the Thirty Years' War, there were only two families left in Rohrbach. By 1790, however, there were 24 households. This war also took its toll on the local livestock: in 1635, the Imperial general Matthias Gallas conquered the Oberamt of Lichtenberg, leaving only one cow standing. In 1733, the land passed to the Birkenfeld-Bischweiler line. Also in the 18th century, many people emigrated out of economic need. In 1741, Jakob Meyer left with four children, and in 1766, Michel Danneck left with four persons. All went to America (the United States did not yet exist). In 1789, a new disagreement arose when Freisen was asked to plant coppices, and chose to do this in the cadastral area known as Hundklopp. Rohrbach protested because Hundklopp was meant to be commonly held grazing land, and the village was entitled, under an agreement on grazing land, to a livestock path that gave access to livestock watering. It was eventually decided that only a fourth of the land would be planted with coppice. =French Revolution and Napoleonic times= This problem, though, paled next to the one that began that same year, namely the French Revolution. In its wake, Rohrbach, having formerly belonged to the Amt of Berschweiler, and for a short while to the Amt of Nohfelden, was assigned under French rule, beginning in 1793, to the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Berschweiler in the canton of Baumholder. In 1819, there were 128 inhabitants in Rohrbach living in 19 houses. =Principality of Lichtenberg= With Napoleon‚Äôs downfall and the Congress of Vienna, Rohrbach and the surrounding area became part of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld as the Principality of Lichtenberg. This arrangement lasted until 1834 when, by treaty, the Principality was incorporated into the Prussian state as the Sankt Wendel district. Twelve years later, Rohrbach burnt to ashes in a fire of unknown origin. A smaller fire in 1891 claimed two houses. At the time the school was built in 1876, the village had 40 houses. Roughly one third of them had upper floors, while the rest were bungalows. All were roofed with either slate or tiles. Beside a house usually stood a stable, then the barn, and then another stable. =Imperial Germany= After the Franco-Prussian War in 1870/1871, some small farmers from Rohrbach moved to the neighbouring Saar area to work in the mines or ironworks. Before the First World War, some 30 men from Rohrbach were employed in the Saar area. The men spent the workweek at their jobs away from the village, sleeping in dormitories on site, and coming home only on weekends. This difficulty kept many from taking up jobs as miners, leaving them only with farming as a livelihood. Often this was not enough, and malnutrition was rife. It could be seen in schoolchildren's languor and pallor. In 1906, Rohrbach had a watermain, which came at a cost of 13,000 to 14,000 marks. Building work on the church began in 1907, and this cost roughly 48,000 marks. When the First World War broke out on 2 August 1914, 25 fighters left the village to go to war. Twelve fell in action; a further four were taken prisoner. =Weimar Germany= In 1922, Rohrbach was hooked up to the Baumholder district power station, although electricity was, given the financial difficulties at that time, quite dear. In 1923, the French franc was introduced as a currency. Along with other misfortunes in the 1920s, foot-and- mouth disease struck in 1926. The first radio made its appearance in Rohrbach in 1928. In 1930, there was a celebration when the French finally withdrew from the Rhineland in 1930. =Nazi Germany= In 1933, Adolf Hitler became German Chancellor, marking the birth of the Third Reich, and on 10 July of that same year, a Nazi named Johann Knop was installed as the head of the municipality of Rohrbach. On 1 March 1935, the Saarland was returned to German sovereignty, causing much excitement in the local area, as many believed that this event would alleviate unemployment. Also this year, Hitler introduced conscription. In 1939, the Second World War began. The war came home to Rohrbach: in 1940, a twin-engine bomber had to make an emergency landing on the Halterskopf, in 1943, there was an aerial engagement above the village, and of course, the village was occupied in 1945. This happened at about ten o‚Äôclock in the morning on 18 March, and the village did not fall without a fight. American tanks and German infantry engaged each other, resulting in four deaths on the German side. =Since the Second World War= Twelve OST- Arbeiter went home, and by 29 May 1945, the first men from Rohrbach who had gone to war came home. The last homecoming, though, did not happen until 21 July 1949. Under Allied occupation, there were many house searches. Refugees from the Saarland showed up. Nine men from Rohrbach had fallen in the war, and a further four had gone missing (a memorial to them was dedicated in 1961). In 1946, a census yielded a population figure for Rohrbach of 217, of whom 202 were Catholic and the other 15 Protestant. In 1948 came currency reform, and the Deutsche Mark became the currency. One Deutsche Mark was worth 10 of the old Reichsmarks. Also, sewerage came in 1952. A volunteer fire brigade was established in 1957. In 1958, there were six American families living in Rohrbach, and the number of cars in the village amounted to six. In 1959, there was one television set in the village, and in 1960, Flurbereinigung was completed. In 1969, Rohrbach expressed a wish to be amalgamated with nearby Freisen; its population at this time was 286. Rohrbach families have twice had triplets in recent decades, with one set born in 1984 (Diana, Christina and Jessica) and another in 1997 (Hannah, Marie and Lukas). In 1989, the municipality elected its first woman municipal councillor, Christine Niegisch. In 1995, ‚Äúpot patches‚Äù were discovered in Rohrbach.Rohrbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Rohrbach's mayor is Bernhard Sauer, and his deputies are Franz-Josef Ley and Ignatius Forster.Rohrbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess argent issuant from the line of partition a demilion azure armed and langued gules, and vert a bend sinister wavy abased issuant from which two bulrushes Or. The charge in the upper field, the lion, is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the County of Veldenz. The charges in the lower field are canting for the village's name, Rohrbach, which roughly translated means ‚ÄúBulrush Brook‚Äù. Culture and sightseeing The municipality of Rohrbach was featured on 10 September 2009 on the SWR3 programme Hierzuland, showing its lively village life and clubs. Along with clubs such as the ‚ÄúTell‚Äù shooting club, the volunteer fire brigade, the Auf zur Heide carrier pigeon club, the angling club, the Catholic women's association, ‚ÄûSchrillen Grillen‚Äú e.V. (dancing and Carnival) and the promotional association with its many unpaid helpers, there are also those who do their best to maintain the village's traditions. Economy and infrastructure Rohrbach has a village community centre. =Transport= Running south of the municipality is the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier). Serving nearby Heimbach is a railway station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). =Economy= In days gone by, Rohrbach was purely a farming village, with cropraising and livestock raising. Later, some people worked at the coalfields and ironworks along the Saar. In recent decades, though, the village has undergone a great shift in economic structure. There are no longer any full-time farmers. Those who work go to jobs in the surrounding area (in Baumholder, for instance), with a few even going as far as Ludwigshafen each day. Over the last few decades, the population figure has been shrinking as young people choose to move away after their studies or apprenticeship, seeing not much in the way of job prospects locally, and greener pastures elsewhere.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld, whose seat is in the like-named town. Geography =Location= The municipality lies in the westernmost part of the Birkenfeld district on the like-named river Meckenbach in a hollow at the edge of the Schwarzw√§lder Hochwald (forest) in the Hunsr√ºck. The municipal limit runs concurrently for more than 5 km with the boundary with the Saarland. The municipal area measures 378 ha, of which 220 ha is wooded, mainly with mixed forest, and it is also mostly privately owned. History In 1334, Meckenbach had its first documentary mention. On this occasion, a certain ‚ÄúCuno in den Gassen zu Birkenfeld‚Äù (‚ÄúCuno in the laneways at Birkenfeld‚Äù) vowed that he would ‚Äúimprove‚Äù his holding at the estate in Meckenbach and in future try harder to maintain it in a better state. The very name Meckenbach, though, makes it clear that the place was settled a few centuries earlier, for it is typical of placenames from the time when the Franks took over the land between the 6th and 9th century. The land had already been settled in prehistoric times, of course. A dig by Prof. Dr. H. Baldes before the First World War at a barrow 500 m southwest of the village in the cadastral area known as ‚ÄúAuf dem B√ºhl in Sangb√∂sch‚Äù yielded objects from early La T√®ne times (no later than 225 BC). Meckenbach's history is tightly bound with the Pflege (literally ‚Äúcare‚Äù, but actually a local geopolitical unit) and the parish of Achtelsbach, to which also belonged, among others, the villages of Br√ºcken (the part on the Traun's right bank only), Traunen, Eisen and Obers√∂tern, and an estate between Meckenbach and Obers√∂tern called Haupenthal. Beginning in 1480 the lordship and court were held by the Duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. The Counts Palatine of Birkenfeld, even though they were the Duke's kin, had no say in the village's affairs. The Lords of S√∂tern, and thereby the Duchy of Lorraine, had taxation rights in the Pflege of Achtelsbach, and also determined who the parish priest would be. This often complicated matters. For instance, in 1523, the Reformation was introduced into the Duchy of Zweibr√ºcken, but much to the Duke's displeasure, the priest in Achtelsbach kept preaching Catholic belief for some years thereafter, until the Reformation also took hold in S√∂tern. What is clear from the Achtelsbach church books is that 400 years ago, a milder climate must have prevailed in the area. In 1579, for instance, the clergyman deemed it worthy of mention that ‚Äúin the middle of October, a great cold fell, and the grapes froze on the vine‚Äù. Also from these books, it is known that in 1609, Meckenbach was a hamlet of seven houses and 29 inhabitants: 6 married couples, 12 children, 3 widows, 1 manservant and 1 maidservant. Prof. Dr. H. Baldes reports that in the 19th century, in and near Meckenbach, money, sometimes in great amounts, was sometimes found, presumably having been hidden in the Thirty Years' War. It may have been that since Meckenbach lay somewhat off the military road that led from Birkenfeld by way of Br√ºcken, Achtelsbach and S√∂tern to Tholey, it was considered a safe haven of sorts. On 25 September 1635, when the fleeing Swedish-French army under Duke Bernard of Weimar was using the said military road to retreat to France, Meckenbach escaped calamity. Br√ºcken, Eisen and Haupenthal were not so lucky and were burnt down; it was 30 years before they were once again settled. In June 1639, on the other hand, Meckenbach was the only village in the local area to be plundered by the Spaniards, who luckily did not also burn the village down. The municipality of Meckenbach took part in the contest Unser Dorf soll sch√∂ner werden (‚ÄúOur village should become lovelier‚Äù) from 1971 to 1975 with great success, as witnessed by several awards on the state level. The high point came on 23 November 1973 when Meckenbach won the Rhineland- Palatinate gold medal in the contest. This was presented at the Electoral Palace in Mainz amid great festivity, with the municipality's male singing club, M√§nnergesangverein 1896 Meckenbach, participating. Since that time, there have been infrastructure improvements in the municipality such as roadway upgrades, the building of a fire station and a community centre and sewerage. As of 2004, the contest commission began appraising Meckenbach again. In 2004, in the district contest, now known as Unser Dorf hat Zukunft (‚ÄúOur village has a future‚Äù), Meckenbach managed third place, and the regional commission currently ranks it as second in the main class.Meckenbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 6 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Meckenbach's mayor is Werner M√∂hlecke, and his deputy is Stefan Bill.Meckenbach‚Äôs council =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess vert a cramp fesswise between six mullets, three chevronwise above and three chevronwise reversed below, all argent, and sable issuant from base a demilion Or armed, langued and crowned gules.

Two Autobahnen also pass near Meckenbach: the A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier) to the south and the A 1 to the west. The Bostalsee and Oberhambach recreational areas are each about ten minutes‚Äô drive away. Saarbr√ºcken, Trier and Kaiserslautern can all be reached by Autobahn in roughly half an hour, as can the towns of Idar-Oberstein and Sankt Wendel over Bundesstra√üe 41. Serving nearby Neubr√ºcke and T√ºrkism√ºhle are railway stations on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken). Agriculture once characterized the village scene in Meckenbach, but in recent decades, the village's economic underpinnings have undergone a great shift. Nowadays, Meckenbach has only one full-time farmer tending a farm in the municipality. Meckenbach is a rather quiet village, despite lying right near two Autobahnen (which would usually make a place attractive to commercial interests), and to satisfy the demand for building land from both its own citizens and those from outside, the municipality had to open up a new building area.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= Sien lies between Idar-Oberstein and Lauterecken northeast of the Baumholder troop drilling ground. =Neighbouring municipalities= Sien borders in the north on the municipality of Otzweiler (Bad Kreuznach district), in the east on the municipality of Hoppst√§dten (Kusel district; not to be confused with Hoppst√§dten-Weiersbach), in the south on the municipality of Langweiler (Kusel district; not to be confused with Langweiler in the Birkenfeld district), in the southwest on the municipality of Unterjeckenbach (Kusel district) and the Baumholder troop drilling ground and in the west on the municipality of Sienhachenbach. Sien also meets the municipality of Schmidthachenbach at a single point in the northwest. History =Celtic times= The earliest traces of habitation in what is now Sien's municipal area go far back before the Christian era, bearing witness to which are two extensive fields of barrows. There are hundreds here, built by the Treveri, a people of mixed Celtic and Germanic stock, from whom the Latin name for the city of Trier, Augusta Treverorum, is also derived. Among the most important archaeological finds unearthed at one of the two barrows where digs have been undertaken is a beak-spouted clay ewer. Buried with Celtic princes in the time around 400 BC (La T√®ne A) were Etruscan bronze beak-spouted ewers, a luxury that few could afford. These were for serving Celts as festive wine vessels, even in the afterlife. Grave goods from ordinary people's graves, however, were humbler things, mostly made of clay. Nowhere had a clay imitation of a bronze Etruscan ewer ever been unearthed, which was somewhat against expectations, until 1972. That year, in Sien, a Celtic warrior's grave yielded up such a vessel. The humble potter had not merely slavishly copied the Etruscan model, but had also thrown the 29 cm-tall piece on his wheel in such a way that he gave it a thoroughly unique artistic form. The original is to be found at the Trier State Museum, while a replicas are on display at the local history museum in Birkenfeld and in Sien.Sien‚Äôs Celtic history =Roman times= Archaeological finds, of which there have been many, also establish that Sien's municipal area was settled in Roman times (2nd to 4th century AD). Most noteworthy among the finds from this era has been a well-preserved column made of light- coloured sandstone. Presumably it belonged to the portico villa of a Roman estate. The column, unearthed in 1973, was carved out of a single block of stone (a monolith). With the capital and the abacus, it measures some 2 m tall. It tapers slightly towards the top and has a diameter of roughly 36 cm. The column's surface is, given sandstone's characteristics, rough. In two places, just above the base and also just below the necking, is a fine groove turned on a lathe. On the whole, it could be an example of the Tuscan style. The column can nowadays be found being used as a support for the little porch at the entrance to the Evangelical church in Sien.Sien‚Äôs Roman history =Frankish times= Today's village of Sien was founded by Germanic, namely Frankish, settlers who made it their home after the Roman Empire had fallen. Bearing witness to this is the village's own name, Sien, which likely derives from the Old High German word sinithi (‚Äúgrazing land‚Äù). Since the parish of Sien is considered one of the oldest ones in the area, the village may well have been one of the earliest Frankish foundings in the time between the 6th and 10th centuries. Moreover, Sien was the hub of a high court district, witnessed as early as 970, and a fief granted by the Salian emperor to the Emichones, gau counts in the Nahegau, who later called themselves the Waldgraves and Raugraves. The Nahegau was divided into administrative zones called Hochgerichte (‚Äúhigh courts‚Äù). The one whose seat was in Sien was called the Hochgericht auf der Heide (‚ÄúHigh Court on the Heath‚Äù). The Hochgericht comprised a vast area (18 650 ha) between the Nahe and the Glan with all together 50 population centres, although some of these later vanished. Court was held at least once a year on the heath near Sien (hence its name). The count or the Schulthei√ü, as the king's representative, administered justice along with 14 Heidesch√∂ffen (‚Äúheath Sch√∂ffen‚Äù, or, roughly ‚Äúheath lay jurists‚Äù). Today the cadastral names K√∂nigsw√§ldchen (‚ÄúKing‚Äôs Little Wood‚Äù) and Galgenberg (‚ÄúGallows Mountain‚Äù) recall the former execution places.Sien‚Äôs Frankish history =Middle Ages= In 1128, Sien had its first documentary mention in the so-called Adalbert Document, in which it says that Archbishop of Mainz Ruthard had bestowed upon the Disibodenberg Monastery ‚Äì quite possibly as an economic hedge ‚Äì one Hufe of land (this was between 30 and 60 Morgen, and a Morgen itself could be between 0.2 and 1 ha) in Sien (‚Äú‚Ä¶et in Sinede hubam‚Äù). In this same document, the namesake Archbishop of Mainz Adalbert (1109-1137) confirmed his predecessor's donations to Disibodenberg. The donation of the Hufe of land might have taken place about 1108, for it was then that building work on a new Benedictine monastery began at the forks of the Nahe and Glan, after the old one had been destroyed in the 10th century and forsaken by the monks. The Adalbert Document is reproduced in the Disibodenberg Monastery's cartulary, now kept at the state archive at Darmstadt. Over the course of history, the village has been known as Sinede, Synede, Synde, Syende, Siende and Syne, among other names, before settling on the currently customary form, Sien. Divisions of inheritance and feuds led to an ever-greater splintering of the gau counts‚Äô formerly unified holding. Thus, Sien passed by way of inheritance in 1112 to the Counts of Veldenz, the Emichones‚Äô successors. From the 13th century, Sien itself was even divided. One part belonged to the Waldgraves of Grumbach ‚Äì and as of 1375 to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg ‚Äì while the other part was held by the Counts of Loon (a place nowadays in Belgium), who were offspring of the V√∂gte and prefects of the Foundation of Mainz, and thereby also possibly heirs to the Mainz church estate in Sien. In 1325, the Counts of Loon, who in the late 13th century built a moated castle on their part of Sien, enfeoffed the knight Kindel von Sien with the castle and half the village of Sien, as well as with further, considerable holdings. The small castle was known in documents as Festes hus (‚Äústeadfast house‚Äù), but for all its steadfastness, on 28 September 1504, it was destroyed in the Landshut War of Succession and was never restored. All that is left of it now is the former castle well. There is also a memorial plaque on Schlo√üstra√üe (‚ÄúCastle Street‚Äù) in the village. Two local cadastral names also recall the old castle: ‚ÄúSchlosswies‚Äù (‚ÄúCastle Meadow‚Äù) and ‚ÄúAm Weiher‚Äù (‚ÄúAt the Pond‚Äù ‚Äì meaning of course the former moat). The part of the municipal area where the castle once stood was officially known as Sienerh√∂fe (‚ÄúSien Estates‚Äù), but it was never locally known as anything other than the Schloss (‚ÄúCastle‚Äù), and accordingly, the inhabitants were called the Schl√∂sser. The Counts, though, ceded the feudal overlordship over their Sien holdings in 1334 to the Waldgraves of Dhaun. The then Count of Loon and Chiny, Ludwig, issued a writ releasing all his vassals and subjects who were part of the castle holding from any and all duty and loyalty to him, but in the same breath, Ludwig reminded them that they now owed their new overlord, the Waldgrave of Dhaun, Johannes, the same as they had owed their old overlord. The writ bore Ludwig's seal on the back. An enfeoffment document gives information about the fief. It apparently comprised the castle, half the village of Sien, half the village of Sienhoppst√§dten, the lordly rights as they pertained to the church and the tithes from Sien, Sienhoppst√§dten, Schweinschied, Selbach, Reidenbach, Oberhachenbach and Niederhachenbach. In 1431, the Knights of Sien died out in the male line. Schonetta von Siende, the last knightly feudal lord's niece, brought the Sien fief by marriage to Reinhard von Sickingen to the Lords of Sickingen, whose best known family member was her grandson, Franz von Sickingen. Schonetta von Siende was the last of the knightly house of Sien. Her first marriage was to the knight Hermann Boos von Waldeck, but he died young. A son that she bore in this union inherited parts of Dickesbach and Schmidthachenbach from the Sien fief. Schonetta married her second husband in 1449, and bore him a son, Schwicker von Sickingen, who later became Franz von Sickingen's father. Schonetta died on 1 January 1483 in Kreuznach. In the upheaval of the Reformation, her bones were transferred from Kreuznach to Ebernburg, where the family Sickingen kept its seat. Thereafter, however, the trail is lost, and the whereabouts of Schonetta's bones is now unknown. There is, however, still a stone to her memory at the parish church in Sien. It dates from roughly 1560.Sien‚Äôs mediaeval history =Age of Absolutism= In 1765, the Sickingens sold off their holdings in Sien to Johann XI Dominik Albert, Prince at Salm-Kyrburg (known as Prince Dominik) and owner of the other half of Sien, thereby ending the age of two lords holding the village as a condominium. One thing left over from that age, though, was the denominational split between Catholics and Protestants that had arisen from the two lords‚Äô different policies. On the other hand, under Prince Dominik's enlightened rule, trade and crafts blossomed, which was something sorely needed. Hardly needed, though, were some of the subsequent events, such as the Plague, the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) and the Nine Years' War (1688-1697; known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), which laid the land waste and sharply decimated the local population. According to one memorandum, in 1698, Sien comprised no more than 15 houses. Prince Dominik was one of the most important rulers among the Lords of Salm, to whom the Oberamt of Kirn passed after the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial line of Kyrburg died out. He was born in 1708 in Mechelen, nowadays in Belgium, and despite being orphaned at the age of eight, this Jesuit-educated boy lived what was at that time a relatively charmed life as an heir to the Salm estates. His father's death, of course, meant that he inherited his father's holdings, the lordship of Leuze in the County of Hainaut (nowadays mostly in the Belgian province of Hainaut, but with parts in the neighbouring French Department of Nord). Thus, even as a youngster, he could enjoy a carefree life of leisure in Vienna, the more so when he and his brother Philipp Joseph received the Oberamt of Kirn in 1743. This included the Schulthei√üerei of Sien, along with half the village of the same name. Two years later, both brothers were raised to princely status. Dominik now underwent a gradual shift in his ways of thinking and in his attitude towards life, which was helped along by various educational travels, whereafter he permanently moved house in 1763 to Kirn so that he could quite humbly live amongst his subjects. As an enlightened prince, he was very concerned about their welfare, and worried particularly about their education and religious upbringing. Prince Dominik built himself many lasting monuments, mostly ecclesiastical buildings. In Sien, he had the old church, which had fallen into disrepair, torn down in 1765, and on the same site, he had built a new church in plain, rustic Baroque style with a tower topped with an onion dome. Today, this is the Evangelical church. However, at the time it was built, Prince Dominik stipulated that it was to be open for use by both Catholics and Protestants, thus creating a simultaneum. The hunting lodge in Sien, now run as an inn, is also one of Prince Dominik's projects. In 1770 he had it built by his court master builder, Johann Thomas Petri. It features a triaxial middle risalto under a triangular spire light, a slated mansard roof and above the doorway a sandstone relief by Bernkastel sculptor Johann Philipp Maringer showing two wildmen bearing the princely coat of arms. When Johann XI Dominik Albert, Prince at Salm-Kyrburg, died on 2 June 1778, there was great and sincere mourning. His remains lie in the quire at the Evangelical Kirche am Hahnenbach (‚ÄúChurch on the Hahnenbach‚Äù) in Kirn.Sien‚Äôs history in the Age of Absolutism =Modern times= The 1789 French Revolution marked the end of princely rule in the little Principality of Salm-Kyrburg, to which Sien belonged. The ideals of Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√© were brought into the territorially splintered land of Germany by French Revolutionary troops. Soon, la R√©publique fran√ßaise stretched all the way to the Rhine‚Äôs left bank. On 10 March 1798 the liberty pole was put up in Sien. Sieners were no longer serfs, but rather free French citizens. The properties formerly held by the last Salm-Kyrburg Prince, Friedrich III, Prince Dominik‚Äôs nephew, who had already been put to death by guillotine in Paris by 1794, were confiscated and auctioned off to the highest bidder. Even the Prince‚Äôs hunting lodge got a new, untitled owner. Sixteen years French times lasted (1798-1814), during which Sien was raised to a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) for the surrounding villages of Sienhachenbach, Oberreidenbach, Dickesbach, Kefersheim, Illgesheim, Hoppst√§dten, Oberjeckenbach and Unterjeckenbach. The lands acquired by France on the Rhine's left bank were subdivided on the French model into departments, arrondissements and cantons. The Mairie of Sien belonged to the Canton of Grumbach, the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld and the Department of Sarre, whose seat was at Trier. Even after the German campaign that put an end to the War of the Sixth Coalition in the Napoleonic Wars, Sien remained a mayoralty in the Saxe-Coburg-ruled Principality of Lichtenberg with its capital at Sankt Wendel. This territorial arrangement was set forth at the Congress of Vienna. It retained the status when the Prussians took over in 1834. In Saxe-Coburg times, and Prussian times, too, the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Sien comprised Sien and Sienerh√∂fe (where the castle had been), Sienhachenbach, Schmidthachenbach, Mittelreidenbach, Oberreidenbach, Weierbach, Dickesbach, Zaubach, Kefersheim, Wickenhof, Ehlenbach, Wieselbach, Kirchenbollenbach, Mittelbollenbach and Nahbollenbach. In Prussian times, the Amtshaus (administrative centre for the Amt) was built. With the new lords, a gradual economic upswing set in, reaching a peak in the latter half of the 19th century. Many urban-style houses and the Gothic Revival Catholic church, upon whose consecration in 1892 the simultaneum ended, still bear witness to the wealth at that time. Sien's small Jewish community enjoyed a heyday in the 19th century, too, which found architectural expression in the synagogue, built about 1845. Despite the favourable economic development, however, many Seiners chose to emigrate, with most going to the United States. The economic upswing brought along with it a building boom. As well as the houses and the Catholic church mentioned above, the Evangelical parish built a new schoolhouse in 1838 out of its own financial resources. A Catholic schoolhouse followed in 1868. In 1871, Sien had roughly 600 inhabitants, of whom some 70 were of Jewish background. There was a vast array of retail businesses, as well as four inns and a brewery. A major knitting mill, a brickyard and a construction company also set up shop in the village. A full range of craft businesses was also available then. The late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw improvements in infrastructure. Streets were cobbled, and lit by lanterns at night, modern (for that time) firefighting equipment was secured, as well as a steam-powered threshing machine, and a watermain was built. In the 20th century, though, Sien suffered several unfortunate blows. The railways through the Nahe and Glan valleys bypassed the village, stripping it of its hitherto enjoyed status as an economic centre of sorts. This led in turn to the loss of the mayoralty, which had to be yielded to Weierbach in 1909. The structural shift in agriculture and the expropriation of land by the Third Reich for the new Baumholder troop drilling ground in 1938, displacing roughly 4,000 people and stripping Sien of a great deal of its outlying municipal area, led to a further loss for the municipality's position as an economic and political force locally. The once well attended markets held in the village died out, and the population figure began to shrink. On 1 April 1939, Sienerh√∂fe, which until this time had been a self-administering municipality, was amalgamated with Sien.Statistik des Deutschen Reichs, Band 450: Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis f√ºr das Deutsche Reich, Teil I, Berlin 1939; Seite 284 In the early 21st century, the economic downturn has been turned round somewhat with the location of modern industrial operations in the municipality. Jewish community The first written records of a permanent Jewish presence in Sien go back to the 18th century. In the Verzeichnis deren in dem hochf√ºrstlichen salm-kyrburgischen Ort Syen unter hochf√ºrstlichem Schutz wohnenden Juden (‚ÄúDirectory of Jews Living in the High- Princely Salm-Kyrburg Village of Syen Under High-Princely Protection‚Äù), dated 28 March 1760, five Jewish household heads are named. There were 42 Jewish inhabitants in 1808. Numerically, the peak was reached in 1852 when there were 72 registered Jewish inhabitants in Sien. This was out of a total population of 530. Although the Jewish population had been rising in the earlier half of the 19th century, in the latter half, it shrank. This trend continued after the turn of the century. There were 36 in 1895, and only 10 by 1925. Sien's last six Jews were deported by the Nazis in 1942 and murdered in the Holocaust. Sien's Jews belonged mostly to two families, Rothschild and Schlachter. To be sure, there were other surnames, but these two predominated. Recalling the former Jewish community and its culture today are very few things. Among these are the graveyard, a mikveh and a Jewish livestock merchant's account book.Sien‚Äôs modern history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Sien's mayor is Otto Sch√ºtzle, and his deputies are Burkhard M√ºller and Bernd Schuck.Sien‚Äôs executive =Coat of arms= The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess enhanced in chief party per pale Or five roundels, two, one and two, sable and gules two salmon addorsed argent, in base argent two scarps vert between which six oakleaves proper, one, three and two.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Herrstein-Rhaunen, whose seat is in Herrstein. Geography =Location= The municipality lies on a ridge in the southern Hunsr√ºck between Rhaunen and Herrstein. =Neighbouring municipalities= Sulzbach borders in the north and northwest on the municipality of Rhaunen, in the east on the municipality of Bollenbach, in the southeast on the municipality of Wickenrodt, in the south on the municipality of Oberhosenbach and in the southwest on the municipality of Hottenbach. History Sulzbach's church was consecrated by 1326, and its solidly built tower bears witness to its once having been a fortified church. Sulzbach's historical claim to fame stems from the birth of two industries of rather disproportionate importance to the village's size. Both also sprang from the same family. The Sulzbach village smith, Johann Nikolaus Stumm (born 1669), bought up several old Hunsr√ºck hammermills and ran them with such great success that he became the father of the Saarland‚Äôs smelting industry. The later ‚Äúiron barons‚Äù of the family Stumm dominated and characterized the Saar region's economic history for a good two hundred years. While Johann Nikolaus might have been said to concern himself with the ‚Äúrougher‚Äù things in life as an industrialist, his younger brother, Johann Michael Stumm (born 1683) was rather one who concerned himself with the finer things in life. Johann Michael was a skilled goldsmith and a music lover, and became the founder of the Stumm organ-building ‚Äúdynasty‚Äù. His last instrument, completed in 1746, is still in service at the church in his home village. The first Stumm organ ever built was installed in the church in the neighbouring village of Rhaunen in 1723. All together, Johann Michael Stumm and his descendants built roughly 370 organs in Sulzbach, installing them in churches in the region whose limits are marked by Saarbr√ºcken, Karlsruhe and the Middle Rhine. Right near Sulzbach lies the historical Heuchelheim marketplace at the fork in an ancient trade road between the Glan and the Moselle. This road was already in use in the Bronze Age, was expanded in Roman times and continued to be used on into the Middle Ages. One fork led by way of Rhaunen and B√ºchenbeuren to Enkirch, while the other ran straight over the Idarkopf to the Temple of Sirona in Hochscheid, and onwards to a junction in the Zolleiche district with the ancient Via Ausonia (or Ausoniusstra√üe in German), which itself runs between Bingen and Trier. Heuchelheim market was also the location of a Celtic-Roman worship centre, which later served as the mediaeval Rhaunen high court's thingstead (the court was an administrative body as much as it was a judicial one). In 1829, the plot was still known as Galgenfeld (‚ÄúGallows Field‚Äù). Sometime after 1870, its appearance was enhanced with the planting of some trees in a Kaisergarten (‚ÄúEmperor‚Äôs Garden‚Äù). Today it is a place for picnicking and recreation.Sulzbach‚Äôs history Politics =Municipal council= The council is made up of 8 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat =Mayor= Sulzbach's mayor is Horst Schm√§ler.Sulzbach‚Äôs mayor =Coat of arms= The German blazon reads: The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Per fess Or a monster with a wolf's head and an eagle's body sans talons displayed gules, its breast charged with a cramp sable, and azure a range of eleven organ pipes argent. The charge above the line of partition is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Waldgraviate-Rhinegraviate and indeed is the heraldic device once used in the Waldgravial-Rhinegravial court seal at Rhaunen. The charge below, the organ pipes, refers to the well known family Stumm, who came from Sulzbach.Description and explanation of Sulzbach‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing =Buildings= The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district * Evangelical church, Hinterdorfstra√üe ‚Äì aisleless church from the earlier half of the 18th century, east tower dendrochronologically dated to 1367 on the ground floor, 1473 on the upper floor; d√©cor, organ, marked 1746, by Johann Michael Stumm; two steel bells from the Bochumer Verein, 1924 * Hauptstra√üe 18 ‚Äì Genossenschaftsm√ºhle (‚ÄúCooperative Mill‚Äù); building with half-hipped roof; equipment * Kirchstra√üe, at the graveyard ‚Äì warriors‚Äô memorial, sandstone stele with relief, crowned with the Iron Cross, 1929, firm of F.

It was the last one that Johann Michael Stumm ever made, and he donated it to his home village. There are regular concerts staged by the Sulzbach Stumm Organ Club (Stummorgelverein Sulzbach). Economy and infrastructure Although the village has an agricultural character, it also lives off tourism (holidaymaking in the country or on the farm) and slate processing. Sulzbach does have its own slate mine, about a kilometre from the village, where underground mining was once done, but owing to slate imports, mainly from Spain, only the processing is done nowadays.

There are two separate and distinct sub- zones: Vinalop√≥, which extends along the banks of the River Vinalop√≥ in the southern area of the province, where the Monastrell grape variety and red wine production are predominant; and the smaller and newer sub-zone known as La Marina, along the coast in the northern area of the province, where the Moscatel grape variety and white wine production are predominant. Alicante is most renowned for producing a traditional sweet dessert wine known as Fondill√≥n, made from overripe grapes. History Alicante has a long history of grape growing and wine production, which was probably introduced by the ancient Romans. The Golden Age of Alicante wines was during the 16th and 17th centuries, when they were imported to northern Europe by English, Swedish and Flemish merchants. In 1510 a royal decree prohibited the importation of wine into the province of Alicante while local wine was produced there. The town of Mon√≤ver was internationally renowned in the 16th century for its Fondill√≥n wine. Soils The soils are mainly dark lime bearing soils on subsoils of sedimentary rock. By the Vinalop√≥ banks, they are quite loose and sandy with almost no organic material present. Climate The climate in the coastal Marina sub-zone is Mediterranean, while the climate in the Vinalop√≥ subzone starts off Mediterranean becoming progressively more continental further inland. In La Marina maximum temperatures in summer are around 30¬∞C and the average minimum in winter is around 13¬∞C, with occasional frost. In the Vinalop√≥, highs in summer are around 35¬∫C and lows in winter around 5¬∫C, with frequent frost. Rainfall is slightly above 500 mm/year in La Marina but scarce in the Vinalop√≥, only at around 300 mm/year. Grapes As in other grape growing regions in Valencia region, Monastrell is the predominant variety, though Garnacha and Merseguera are also present. Due to the heat in summer the vines are planted as low bushes (en vaso). The authorized grape varieties are: * Red: Monastrell, Garnacha Tintorera / Alicante Bouschet, Garnacha Tinta / Gironet, Bobal, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Petit Verdot, Syrah, Tempranillo. * White: Moscatel de Alejandr√≠a, Air√©n, Subirat Parent / Malvas√≠a, Chardonnay, Macabeo, Merseguera, Planta Fina de Pedralba, Sauvignon Blanc, Verdil.

Early life and education Chouteau was born in St. Louis, where his father, Jean Pierre Chouteau, was one of the first settlers and part of the ethnic French elite. His mother was Pelagie Kiersereau (1767‚Äì1793)., 18th c. Roots & Genealogy of Ancestors] One of his brothers was Auguste Pierre Chouteau. A half-brother (by his father's second wife Brigitte Saucier) was Fran√ßois Chouteau, a trader who became one of the first European-American settlers of Kansas City, Missouri. His son-in-law was John F. A. Sanford who later became one of Chouteau's business partners. Career Pierre Chouteau followed in the family footsteps by starting a trade with the Osage tribe at age 15. He also operated lead mines around Dubuque, Iowa until the War of 1812.Pierre Chouteau Jr. (Cadet) Chouteau was a member of Bernard Pratte and Company, the Western agent for John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company in 1827. He pioneered the use of steamboats on the Missouri River. In 1834, Pratte and Chouteau bought all the Missouri River interests of the Astor Fur company. (The northern portion of Astor's company went to Ramsay Crooks, who retained the \\"American Fur Company\\" title for his company.) It was reorganized in 1838 as Pierre Chouteau, Jr. and Company and continued until it dissolved in 1864.Pierre Chouteau In 1847 Pierre and his brother Auguste established Fort Benton in present-day Chouteau County, Montana as the last fur trading post on the Upper Missouri River. In the early days, the Chouteau interests supplied pelts for the beaver hat industry. When the industry began to collapse around 1850, they began a trade in buffalo hides. Chouteau also invested heavily in railroads, rolling mills, and mining. He was an influential contributor to US Senator Thomas Hart Benton. Benton was the namesake for Fort Benton when it was purchased by the US Army in 1865. Legacy and honors *Chouteau County, Montana, was named for him, as is the town Choteau in nearby Teton County. *He built Fort Pierre in South Dakota, which was named for him. Pierre, South Dakota, the state capital across the Missouri river from Fort Pierre, also is named for him. Papers A portion of the Pierre Chouteau and Family Papers are available for research use at the Minnesota Historical Society. They consist of original, photostatic copies from the Missouri Historical Society, and typed transcripts of letters between Pierre Chouteau, Henry Chouteau, Ramsay Crooks, George Davenport, Hercules L.

They were founded in 1978 by singer/songwriter Anthony McCartan from Belfast and multi-instrumentist Geoff Coombs from Essex (later a founding member of the band Kip Keano), after a band they had previously both toured with collapsed. Rosie Short joined soon after its formation having previously been playing in a London-based traditional Irish outfit. During the years that followed, the group frequently changed its line-up, as well as having many guest performers including reed maker Chris Apps. They group frequently toured East Anglia, before slimming down to a duo (McCartan and Short) in order to tour Europe and even Australia. In 1993 the duo moved to Brittany, and was joined by Short's brother Chris (fiddle, mandolin, whistle and musical saw), who had been in London playing in World, Irish and Bluegrass groups. In 1999, after 19 years of touring, they recorded their first studio album The Parting Glass in Vern-sur-Seiche. This was followed by Strange News in 2001 and the live album This Fine Night in 2003 taking tracks from their recent tour of France. From their base in Brittany they toured as a trio throughout France and Europe until McCartan's death from cancer on 4 September 2004. Shortly afterwards, Boris Lebret (double bass, homemade bass, six-string bass banjo, bing-bong-box and percussion) and Topher Loudon (vocals, bouzouki and guitar) joined the group. They have since produced four new albums: New Tales for Old (2005), Amazing (2007), Sing (2009) and Amongst the Green (2012). Topher Loudon left the band and Margaux Scherer (percussion, drums and backing vocals) joined Churchfitters for a new album Get Wise (2014).

Tanke (born 1960) is a Canadian fossil preparation technician of the Dinosaur Research Program at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta. Born in Calgary, Tanke became interested in natural history at an early age. In 1979, Tanke began working for Philip J. Currie in the paleontology department of the Provincial Museum of Alberta, originally as a volunteer. From 1979 until 2005 (when Dr. Currie left the Tyrrell to become a professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton) Tanke worked as a lab and field technician, a job he still holds today.National Research Council Canada Retrieved 2009-05-17. At the museum he is a senior technician in the preparation lab. He does not hold any formal post-secondary degrees, but is active in research and numerous writing projects. Senior editor of the 2001 book Mesozoic Vertebrate Life: New Research Inspired by the Paleontology of Philip J. Currie, Tanke appeared in the 1998 documentary film Dinosaur Park, and the 1993 educational film Messages in Stone. He recently appeared in one episode of Dino Hunt Canada (2015) and an episode of ABC Television's \\"Born to Explore\\" (2015). Lab and field work Tanke has authored papers on dinosaurs and dinosaur paleopathology; his recent work includes preparation of Pachyrhinosaurus fossils. He worked on a large monograph describing a new species (Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai), with senior co-authors Philip J. Currie and Wann Langston, Jr. Most of the material described therein was prepared by him. This monograph, 21+ years in the making, was released at Grande Prairie Regional College on October 1, 2008. This publication describes skull material from the extremely rich Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai bonebed on Pipestone Creek, southwest of Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada. Also with this publication are two other papers, one describing the site taphonomy and quarry map and another paper describing the endocast and brain structure of P. lakustai. Tanke has also authored papers on Tyrannosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Styracosaurus, Chasmosaurus, Stegoceras, Centrosaurus, Eoceratops, and various other hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, and tyrannosaurids. Tanke is presently the longest serving employee (36+ years) with the Royal Tyrrell Museum. On August 7, 2008 at the 33rd International Geological Congress meetings in Oslo, Norway, he was made a member of INHIGEO (International Commission on the History of Geological Sciences) and is now the Canadian editor for that organization. He is also a member of the PSP (Paleontological Society of the Peace; Grande Prairie, Alberta) and the APS (Alberta Palaeontological Society), where he regularly gives oral and poster presentations at their annual symposia in Calgary. The Cenomanian (early Late Cretaceous) marine bird Pasquiaornis tankei (Tokaryk, Cumbaa and Storer, 1997) from Carrot River, Saskatchewan, Canada was named in Tanke's honor. He also discovered the type specimen of the Late Cretaceous pachycephalosaurid dinosaur Texacephale langstoni. Darren Tanke has a number of jobs at Tyrrell, including fossil preparation, moulding and casting (in previous years), giving talks to the public or identifying fossils the public brings in for identification. In the field, he looks for, identifies, and collects fossils as well as training and supervising summer field staff and preparation laboratory volunteers. Tanke is interested in technical applications to dinosaur site preservation using quarry stakes (on- site metal markers embedded in concrete); GPS and historical information and garbage to relocate lost quarries (some dating back to 1913) using historical archaeology techniques. He is also interested in dinosaur paleopathology, dinosaur ontogeny, and all aspects of horned dinosaurs. He has been heavily involved in the paleontological activities in the Grande Prairie region since 1983. Much of his recent research focuses on various aspects of Alberta's early human history of paleontological discoveries and research in the province. These include biographies of some of the lesser-known paleontology workers in the province, relocating \\"lost\\" fossil specimens, the World War I sinking of the merchant ship SS Mount Temple and her Albertan dinosaur cargo, etc. He has worked in the field across western Canada and in Montana (1982), Utah (1997), and Texas (2008), mostly in middle and especially Late Cretaceous beds. Overseas fieldwork or history-based research has taken him to Australia (1991), Argentina (2000), China (2005), England (2005, 2008, 2009), France (2001), Mongolia (2005), and Norway (2005). He has also done fieldwork in British Columbia (1985) and Saskatchewan (1985). He has set up an annual ceratopsian (horned dinosaur) research scholarship for University-level students or academics under the Dinosaur Research Institute in Calgary, with whom he is on the board of Directors (beginning in 2008). $1500.00 CDN is awarded each year, the winner notified in May. His current lab work involves the preparation of a hadrosaur skull from near Maycroft, Alberta. Current research and writing projects include several articles on the use of helicopters in Alberta to collect fossils and lift heavy dinosaur skeletons in their plaster field jackets; relocation of a lost (1914) Basilemys turtle quarry and other fossil turtle sites in Dinosaur Provincial Park; and biographies of Albertan amateur fossil collector and artist Hope Johnson (1916‚Äì2010) and Jane Colwell-Danis (1941-), Canada's first formally-trained woman vertebrate paleontologist. Dozens of other writing projects on widely varying aspects of vertebrate paleontology and paleontology history are in various stages of completeness. Two of these are detailed histories of hadrosaur collection and research in Alberta, and a detailed 25+ year chronological history of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Drumheller, Alberta. Another project, done in his own time, was the 2010 reenactment of the 1910-1916 paleontological expeditions who used large flat-bottomed boats or scows in their search for Late Cretaceous dinosaur bones on the Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada. The project ran into medical and technical difficulties in 2010. Efforts were made to get the scow ready to refloat down the river in 2016, but water levels were too low to launch.

It is located in the Maelbeek valley between the Bois de la Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos and the Ixelles Ponds. The abbey church is a Catholic parish of the Archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussels and home to a community of Norbertine canons, while other parts of the monastery house the headquarters of the Belgian National Geographic Institute and La Cambre, a prestigious visual arts school. The abbey was founded around 1196. It was suppressed during the French Revolution. Most of today's buildings date from the 18th century; only the church, the refectory and the wing of the capitular hall maintain their medieval character. The simple abbey church houses Albert Bouts' early 16th-century oil painting The Mocking of Christ. History =Early history= The abbey was founded around 1196 by its , with the support of the monastic community of Villers Abbey (in present-day Walloon Brabant), following the Cistercian rule. Henry I, Duke of Brabant, donated the Ixelles Ponds, a water mill, and the domain of the monastery. The (\\"Abbey of the Chamber of Our Lady\\"), hence in short form, remained under the spiritual guidance of Villers, one of the most important Cistercian communities. La Cambre Abbey in the early 18th century Saint Boniface of Brussels (1182‚Äì1260), a native of Ixelles, canon of Saint Gudula (future cathedral of Brussels), who taught theology at the University of Paris and was made bishop of Lausanne (Switzerland) in 1231, lived for eighteen years in the abbey and is interred in the church. The mystic leper Saint Alix lived in the community at the same epoch. During the numerous wars of religion of the 16th and 17th centuries, the abbey was largely destroyed, but it was rebuilt in the 18th century in the French form it largely retains. It was suppressed during the French Revolution and sold as national property in 1796. =20th century‚Äìpresent= After the abbey closed as a monastic community, the buildings were used successively as a military hospital, a cotton manufacture, a poor house, and a military school. During the First World War, the premises were occupied by German troops. In 1921, the League of Friends of La Cambre moved into the abbey to preserve it. The terraced garden and formal clipped bosquets were restored in the 18th-century manner starting in 1924. La Cambre Abbey has been designated a historic site since 30 June 1953. Architecture and landscape On the Ixelles Ponds' side, La Cambre Abbey has two entrances. The cloister adjoins the Church of Our Lady of the Cambre and the refectory. The abbey church shows the transition between the primitive Gothic and the Flamboyant Gothic styles. Its northern part dates from the 15th century, whilst its southern part has retained its original roof and two windows from the early 14th century. It includes a single nave long and wide, covered with a shingle vault erected in 1603. The 18th-century abbesses' residence, with its cour d'honneur (main courtyard) in the neoclassical style and French formal gardens, has preserved the presbytery, the stables, and other dependencies.

Written and drawn by Jacques Devos, it first appeared in Spirou magazine in 1963 and lasted a quarter of a century, ending with Devos' retirement in 1988. The series consisted mainly of one-page gags and short stories which covered several pages. There were few full-length adventures. The strip was also notable for the puns and jokes in the text. Premise Olivier Delabranche (i.e. Olive Branch) is a scientific genius well ahead of his time and his own age. Super-computers, various types of transport, robots, lifelike holograms, even the elixir of youth, he has invented the lot and more. Be it chemistry or technology, science holds few secrets from him. He qualifies for a dozen Nobel Prizes in those subjects and he is not yet a teenager ! Olivier is in fact a little boy of about 10. Unfortunately, the efforts of this child prodigy go largely unappreciated by the adult world, including parents and teachers. Whereas he should perhaps be in an advanced school where his talents would be developed (as if they needed to be) or even a top university, Olivier is in fact still stuck in a normal, everyday primary school. The reason for this is that, science apart, in all other respects he is a dunce. In history, geography, spelling and grammar, Olivier is at the bottom of the class and the despair of his teacher, Mister Rectitude. The Pupil and the Teacher Most of the stories revolve around the relationship between the little genius and his more down-to-earth teacher, with whom he is engaged in a never-ending war of nerves (nerves being the operative word when it comes to the teacher). While Mister Rectitude tries desperately to maintain discipline, Olivier comes up with all kinds of inventions which cause chaos all over the school. (As if to emphasize the conflict between teacher and pupil, the series was renamed M. Rectitude et G√©nial Olivier when published in book form.) Olivier's greatest pleasure is to take an invention to school which he will use either to play pranks on Mister Rectitude and/or other pupils or members of staff, or come up with ways to cheat in the exams. This, plus his inattention in class or his tendency to chat with his friend Flafla, results in lines and after-school detentions. During these punishments, Olivier tries out some other invention which causes further agro for the teacher and his colleagues. This results in more detentions, more inventions and so on and so on... In the latter years of the series, Olivier became more and more malevolent and his inventions tended to be destined solely to drive the education establishment (and Mister Rectitude in particular) besides themselves with exasperation. Although not entirely a mad scientist himself, Olivier certainly knows how to drive other people crazy. But, as if perhaps trying to give the teaching profession its due, Devos did allow the ever-frustrated Mr Rectitude to get the last word on many occasions. Characters { border=0 Olivier Delabranche is a child prodigy and a brilliant inventor. His creations have included anti-gravity devices, fully-grown clones, time machines and even a faster-than-light spaceship. However, like most small boys, there is a mischievous side to his personality. A lot of his inventions are built in order to play jokes on other kids and grown-ups and he has, on occasion, turned the whole school into a testing ground. However, when it comes to other subjects, he is a complete dunce. This and his lack of attention in class results in a never-ending series of punishments, like lines to write and after-school detentions, which he tries to liven up by having fun with his latest gimmick, which, after a good laugh, is followed by yet more punishment. } { border=0 Mister Ars√®ne Rectitude is Olivier's primary school teacher. Like most of the adults, he does not fully appreciate his pupil's genius or the inventions he comes up with, especially when they are employed in upsetting his nerves, which they usually do. The result is Mister Rectitude dishing out one punishment and detention after another on the young prodigy, who employs more inventions in order to get back at him. Mister Rectitude often confers with his conscience over what is going on or the best way to deal with it. } { border=0 Flafla is Olivier's best friend and sits next to him in class. He sometimes calls on his pal's ingenuity to help out with girls and bullies. Flafla's attitude to Olivier's inventions tends to vary. He enjoys the humour and confusion that results from their use, but at other times predicts nothing but disaster. His predictions have a tendency to turn out right with Flafla sharing in the resulting punishments. Flafla has an eye for the ladies and Olivier sometimes blackmails him into helping test his inventions or else he'll tell Flafla's concurrent girlfriends about each other. ---- Absalon Biscoton is the muscle-bound school bully. He prefers flexing his brawn rather than his brain. An aggressive so-and-so, he will beat up the other pupils on just a whim and the brain-box Olivier in particular. Many of Olivier's inventions are therefore aimed at him. He wears a pink shirt and colourful, stripped trousers. He is the son of the P.E. teacher (originally a policeman) from whom he quite likely gets his thickness in muscles and intelligence. ---- Berthe is Olivier's girlfriend and as such can get jealous and possessive especially when he is looked at by the admiring eyes of other girls. She often calls on him to help make a new outfit or hairstyle or something else to improve her appearance. Needless to say, things don't always go according to plan and, instead of a grateful kiss, Olivier ends up with a slap from Berthe's hand or handbag. } { border=0 The headmaster and senior master can do little but look on at the tricks and chaos unleashed by Olivier and the resultant damage to their school, not to mention the fall in morale amongst their staff. This can get even more edgier when the inspector from the Education Ministry turns up for an unannounced visit. } { border=0 Alphonse, the school janitor, is a simple-minded man. It can take him a while to realise what is going on or who is responsible for the strange events that result from Olivier's inventions. This makes him an ideal target. It also befalls on him to clean up the resultant mess. A former lancer, he is married to another cleaner, L√©ocadie. } { border=0 Phil√©mon Delabranche is Olivier's father. He sometimes takes advantage of his son's inventions, even though they do not always give the results desired or have unexpected consequences. It was his brother, Uncle Alfred, who gave Olivier his first home chemistry set and although there are few details of what happened afterwards, Alfred was forced to share in the resulting cost and Phil√©mon would not talk to him for six months ! (Although some of the early strips refer to Olivier having a mother, she does not feature in them and the latter ones appear to indicate that Mr Delabranche is a single parent.) } Titles Olivier's adventures have not been published in English. Below is a list of the French book titles and their year of publication. Most of them are collections of one-page gags and short stories. Almost all the stories were written and drawn by Jacques Devos, with one being credited to Fr√©d√©ric Jannin. When the stories appeared in Spirou they were titled G√©nial Olivier, but the name was changed to M. Rectitude et G√©nial Olivier when published in book form. 1\\\\. L'√©cole en folie 1974 2\\\\.

After retiring as a player he became a coach, and has worked for various clubs and for the English Football Association. Playing career Born in Senghenydd, Glamorgan, Thomas moved to England to join Bristol Rovers as a youth player. He made his d√©but for their first team on 3 January 1977, as a substitute for Jim Eadie in the away match at Charlton Athletic. Thomas turned professional in September of that year, and went on to become Rovers' first-choice goalkeeper. He faced competition for his jersey with England youth goalkeeper Phil Kite before going on loan to three clubs during 1982‚Äì83, first Cardiff City, then Tottenham Hotspur and Southend United. He left Bristol completely in 1983 to join Newcastle United for ¬£50,000. Thomas appeared regularly for Newcastle as they won promotion to the top-flight in 1984. He was the club's first choice goalkeeper for the 1985‚Äì86 and 1986‚Äì87 seasons. During the 1985‚Äì86 season he was part of the Newcastle side that lost a club record away defeat to West Ham United 8‚Äì1 a game which saw centre back Alvin Martin hit his only first class hat-trick in English professional football, against a three different goalkeepers. In September 1986, he won his first and only international cap for Wales, in a European Championship qualifier against Finland. After a spell on loan to local rivals Middlesbrough, Thomas was sold to Division Two Birmingham City for ¬£75,000 in October 1988. The club suffered relegation in 1989, but returned in 1992. He was part of the side that won the 1991 Associate Members' Cup Final. In 1993, after loan spells to Aston Villa and Crystal Palace, Thomas joined non-league club Cheltenham Town. He made 80 league appearances for the club before retiring as a player in 1995. Coaching career Thomas earned a preliminary coaching certificate whilst playing at Newcastle, and supplemented this with further coaching badges during his time at Birmingham. He eventually earned the UEFA 'A' Coaching licence, taking a position within the Football Association in the early 1990s as a Regional Development Officer in the Midlands. On a part-time basis, Thomas, with other professional goalkeepers, including Steve Ogrizovic, Paul Barron, and Andy Poole, helped train players aged 12‚Äì16 from clubs across the Midlands, in a time when clubs did not have goalkeeping-specific coaches. In 1996, Thomas helped to coach England's under-16 goalkeepers, before joining the FA full-time in 1997, and has since remained part of the England youth coaching. In 1998 Thomas became part of the new Ray Clemence-headed goalkeeping department within the FA, which developed a structure for coaching goalkeeper coaches. He was part of the England U21 coaching staff which took the team to the semi-finals of the 2007 UEFA under-21 championships.

Malik Shah was held prisoner in Isfahan until 1110 when he returned to Anatolia to assume the throne. Shortly before his death he was defeated by the Byzantine emperor Alexios Komnenos at the Battle of Philomelion. Malik Shah then signed a treaty with the emperor, allegedly agreeing to let the Byzantines take back all their land in Anatolia, but the treaty was nullified after Malik Shah was deposed, blinded and eventually murdered by his brother Mesud, who succeeded him as sultan. The loss of prestige suffered by Malik Shah due to his defeat by the Byzantines probably precipitated his fall.Komnene, pp. 488-491Birkenmeier, p.79 footnote Malik Shah was described by Anna Komnena as a fool who often ignored the strategies of his more experienced generals, to the point where he mocked and criticized his generals.

They were largely created by Byron to accompany music composed by Isaac Nathan, who played the poet melodies which he claimed (incorrectly) dated back to the service of the Temple in Jerusalem. Background Nathan was an aspiring composer who was the son of a hazzan (synagogue cantor) of Canterbury, of Polish-Jewish ancestry, and was originally educated to be a rabbi. He had published an advertisement in the London Gentleman's Magazine in May 1813 that he was \\"about to publish 'Hebrew Melodies', all of them upward of 1000 years old and some of them performed by the Ancient Hebrews before the destruction of the Temple.\\"Ashton (1972), p. 6. At this stage, he had no words to go with the melodies which he intended to adapt from synagogue usage (although in fact many of these tunes had originated as European folk-melodies and did not have the ancestry he claimed for them). He initially approached Walter Scott, before writing to Byron in 1814.Ashton (1972), p. 9. Eventually Byron was encouraged by his friend Douglas Kinnaird to take up Nathan's proposal.Ashton (1972), p. 14. Many of the poems were written during the period of Byron's sessions with Nathan between October 1814 and February 1815; a few, including \\"She Walks in Beauty\\" and \\"I speak not ‚Äì I trace not ‚Äì I breathe not\\", predate their meeting.Ashton (1972), pp. 19-21. Nathan's motives were commercial ‚Äì he was hoping to cash in on a fashion for exotic folk music. (A critical review of the first edition, mocking the concept, commented, \\"If we should now see the melodies of Kamschatska, or of Madagascar, or of the Hottentots advertised, [...] we should know what to expect: ‚Äì minstrels, and languishing maidens, the bright tear, the dark blue eye [...]\\")Conway (2012), p. 93. To this end Nathan persuaded the well-known singer John Braham (who was also Jewish) to lend his name to the title page in return for 50% of any profits.Conway (2012), p. 95. Byron's motives for cooperating are less clear, but he seems to have been genuinely sympathetic to the cause of the Jews and he patronizingly enjoyed Nathan's company as a sort of court jester. Byron gave the copyright of the poems to Nathan, and also left him a ¬£50 note when the scandal of the poet's relationship with his half-sister Augusta caused him to flee England in 1816 ‚Äì an event which also boosted sales of the \\"Melodies\\".Conway (2012), pp. 95-6. Publication The first volume of twelve musical settings by Nathan for voice and piano was published in April 1815 by Nathan himself. In May of the same year Byron's complete lyrics were published as a book of poems by John Murray, and an edition containing 24 musical settings was published by Nathan in April 1816.Byron (1998), p. 9. This edition, which sold for a guinea, named Braham as a joint-composer in a frontispiece designed by Edward Blore, which also carried a dedication, by Royal permission, to the Princess Royal, Princess Charlotte, to whom Nathan had given some singing lessons.Ashton (1972), pp 210-11.Conway (2012), p. 95. To the 24 poems published by 1816 Nathan subsequently added six other poems in later editions, the last being \\"Bright be the place of thy soul\\", included in Nathan's Fugitive Pieces and Reminiscences of Lord Byron in 1829.Ashton (1972), pp. 29-30. The poems The poems were not intended to have a religious message, nor were they written from a consistent perspective. In Thomas Ashton's analysis, \\"First Byron gave Nathan the secular love lyrics he had written in [...] 1814. Then, warming to the composer, he provided some vaguely Jewish poems. Finally, after [his] marriage [...] he sent Nathan poems dealing directly with Old Testament subjects.\\"Ashton (1972), p. 66 Byron wrote to Augusta that the Hebrew Melodies were written \\"partly from Job &c.; & partly my own imagination\\". They reflected his general sympathy with the downtrodden: as he once wrote, \\"The Greeks [...] have as small a chance of redemption from the Turks as the Jews have from mankind in general.\\"Cited in Ashton (1972), p. 72. Thomas Ashton writes \\"Byron put together nationalism and Jews to write poems about Jewish nationalism, but in those poems he joined Jewish nationalism and a Calvinistically inclined understanding of the Old Testament to create metaphors of man and man's condition [..] In the plight of the exiled Jews, Byron found man's plight, and the tears he shed for fallen nationhood were shed for fallen man as well.\\"Ashton (1972), pp. 74-5. Nathan's music Not all of the music provided by Nathan can be traced to synagogue melodies; of the first book of twelve, two (\\"I saw thee weep\\" and \\"It is the hour\\") seem to have been composed by Nathan.Byron (1998), p. 13 Those that are from synagogue melodies are far more recent than the time of the Temple, many of them taken from European folk-tunes including Lutheran hymns which were adapted by Jewish congregations in Central Europe. Nathan's settings are of varying quality: for example \\"She Walks in Beauty\\" fits well with the synagogue hymn Adon Olam, whilst \\"On Jordan's Banks\\" is forced to fit the hymn Ma'oz Tzur by clumsily altering the natural stresses on the words.Conway (2012), p. 94. Burwick and Douglass identify four musical styles adopted by Nathan in his settings. \\"On Jordan's Banks\\" and \\"From the Last Hill\\" they classify as hymns. Five, including \\"The Destruction of Sennacherib\\" are executed as 'martial songs'. A third category, the largest (14 songs) they consider derived from German and Italian styles, with \\"My Soul is Dark\\" and its Italian ornamentation an example of the latter, and \\"My Soul is Dark\\" based on the German lieder style. Two of the songs in this category, \\"Thou whose spell\\" and \\"A Spirit Pass'd\\" (whose tripartite structure includes a trio, a recitative and an aria), are considered to be influenced by the tradition of oratorio. In eight of the songs they discern specific 'Jewish' characteristics, either because the music seeks to evoke \\"the stereotypical figure of the suffering Jew\\", or because the melodic line and 'orientalist' harmonies used by Nathan suggest the exoticism of his subject.Byron (1988), pp. 30-37. Reception In October 1814 Byron wrote to his fiancee Annabella Milbanke (whom he was to marry in January 1815, and was a strict Christian) on his writing on this unlikely topic. \\"It is odd enough that this should have fallen to my lot - who have been abused as an \\"infidel\\" - Augusta says they will call me a Jew next\\" - and indeed that came to pass in street ballads, with comments from reviewers of the Melodies such as \\"A young Lord is seldom the better for meddling with Jews\\". The British Review complained that \\"Lord Byron [...] may now be considered as poet laureate to the synagogue.\\" The Courier published parodies of some of the lyrics as English Melodies. These included a version of The Destruction of Sennacherib adapted to a Parliamentary vote (\\"Oh! Tierney came down like a wolf on the fold / And his phalanx of voters was boasting and bold [...]\\"), and a personal attack on the poet based on \\"Sun of the Sleepless\\": \\"Son of the faithless! melancholy rat!/ Whose circling sleeve still polishes thy hat / Offering at once thyself and it to sell [...]\\".Ashton (1972), p. 52 Many reviews were however positive; the Gentleman's Magazine called the verses \\"elegant\\", and they were also approved by the Edinburgh Review and the Ladies' Monthly Museum.Ashton (1972), pp. 45-47. The Christian Observer in August 1815 wrote \\"The present state of the Jewish people - expatriated - dispersed - trodden down - contemned - afforded the noble poet a very fine subject; and [...] he has not neglected to avail himself of it.\\"Byron (1988), p. 14. Influence The poems became popular not only in England but also throughout Europe. In Russia translations of some of the poems were made by Mikhail Lermontov and others. The German poet Heinrich Heine wrote his Hebra√Øscher Melodien (named as a tribute to Byron's work) as the last section of his 1851 collection, Romanzero.Byron (1988), p. 14. Many composers wrote settings of translations of Byron's words, including Felix Mendelssohn, Fanny Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Mily Balakirev and Modest Musorgsky.Conway (2012), p. 100.

Ross Mills of Tiro Typeworks, and Geraldine Wade of Monotype Typography. The name is a Welsh word meaning foundation. In 1997, Tiro was hired by Microsoft Typography to consult on the production of support materials for OpenType font development. Part of this project was producing a multi-script font used for displaying glyphs in Microsoft's cancelled Web Resource for International Typography (WRIT) database, which was a tool for establishing character and glyph requirements for given languages, geographical areas or scripts (or combinations thereof). The project included support for Latin, IPA, Cyrillic, Greek, Armenian, Georgian, and Ge'ez (Ethiopian) characters. Latin glyphs were designed by John Hudson, and the first script developed for Sylfaen. Cyrillic glyphs were designed by John Hudson. The design was reviewed by Maxim Zhukov, typographic coordinator for the United Nations. Greek glyphs were designed by Geraldine Wade, based on the Latin glyphs, with consultation from Gerry Leonidas. Only the glyphs used in monotonic orthography are available. Armenian glyphs were designed by Geraldine Wade, under the guidance of Armenian type designer Manvel Shmavonyan, and his Russian colleague Vladimir Yefimov at ParaType in Moscow. It includes 'classical caps', which are based on the tall capitals in Armenian manuscript. Georgian glyphs include khutsuri and mkhedruli letters. The development of the Georgian script came to a halt when Georgian type designer Anton Dumbadze was fatally struck by a car before being able to finish the design. As a result the font is incomplete. Ethiopic glyphs were designed by Geraldine Wade. The font shipped with Windows 2000 and XP only include a subset of the original designs. In particular, IPA, Polytonic Greek, Ethiopic glyphs are missing. It supports WGL4, Armenian script, and the minuscules of the Georgian alphabet. OpenType features include small caps, glyph substitution. Nyala In 2003‚Äì04, John Hudson completely re-drew the Sylfaen Ethiopic glyphs from the original Sylfaen, regularising them and making them suited to a wider range of publishing needs. This re-design was released by Microsoft in Windows Vista, under the name Nyala. The font name was named for the mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni), a species of great African antelope native to the highlands of Ethiopia. Latin glyphs were designed to harmonize with the Ethiopic glyphs to facilitate the typesetting of texts including un-transliterated foreign names, technical terms, etc. The Ethiopic characters were based on initial drawings by Geraldine Wade.

Veterans' Day was first observed in 2006. Although an official event, it is not a public holiday in the UK. The name was changed to Armed Forces Day in 2009. Armed Forces Day has so far been observed on the last Saturday of June. Origins Plans for a Veterans' Day were announced in February 2006 by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, who said the aim was to ensure the contribution of veterans was never forgotten. The day is marked across the UK by local ceremonies and the presentation of medals to living ex-servicemen and women. The date of 27 June was chosen as it came the day after the anniversary of the first investiture of the Victoria Cross, in Hyde Park, London in 1857. Veterans' Day was created as a permanent extension of Veterans' Awareness Week first held in 2005. Armed Forces Day generally focuses on celebrating living current/ex servicemen & women, whereas Remembrance Day focuses on honouring the dead. Although it used to be called Veterans' Day in the UK, it is not the same as the United States' Veterans Day which is more similar to Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth. On 25 June 2007 Jim Devine, the Member of Parliament for Livingston, tabled a House of Commons Early Day Motion calling for the day to be a public holiday, stating \\"that this House recognises the outstanding contribution that veterans have made to the country; and believes that Veterans' Day should be a national public holiday across the United Kingdom.\\" Veterans' Day  =2006= The first Veterans' Day in 2006 saw a series of events across the UK which included an event at the Imperial War Museum in London, which was attended by Lachhiman Gurung VC, a Nepalese recipient of the Victoria Cross, which was awarded for bravery in 1945 when he was a Rifleman in the 4th Battalion of The 8th Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army during World War II in Burma (Myanmar), and Corporal Christopher Finney GC of the Blues and Royals who was awarded the George Cross for bravery under friendly fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Parades were held in Dundee and Staffordshire as well as a service at Westminster Abbey. There was also an evening reception at 10 Downing Street for representatives of veterans associations. =2007= The 2007 national event was held in Birmingham as the start of a five-day event from 27 June to 1 July. In the morning there was a \\"Parade of Standards\\" which was led by The Central Band of the Royal Air Force, from the International Convention Centre (ICC) to the Hall of Memory in Centenary Square. The day also included celebrations in Victoria Square where a Spitfire aircraft was on display and the Minister for Veterans Derek Twigg presented five Veterans' Badges and met the families of service personnel who died in the line of duty. =2008= For the 2008 Veterans' Day, the national event was hosted in Blackpool as part of the resort's annual \\"National Veterans' Week\\" which ran from 21 to 29 June 2008. Events were held throughout the UK and the day was promoted by a nationwide television advert. The National Veterans' Day Service was held at Blackpool Cenotaph, a Grade II Listed building which had just been restored, by North Pier on central promenade. The service was led by the Bishop of Blackburn and was attended by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Derek Twigg and General Sir Richard Dannatt, the Chief of the General Staff, as well as Henry Allingham (at the time, he was the oldest surviving veteran of World War I). The service was followed by a \\"Schools Veterans' Day Thank You\\" performed by local school children. Various other events were held throughout Blackpool during the day including a \\"Badge Presentation ceremony\\" in the Tower Ballroom with the Duchess of Cornwall presenting veteran badges to among others, Martin Bell. There was also a Veterans' Parade along the promenade and a Falklands War veteran abseiled down Blackpool Tower. The weekly BBC Radio 2 programme Friday Night is Music Night was broadcast live from the Opera House presented by Ken Bruce with the BBC Concert Orchestra, Alfie Boe and Rebecca Thornhill.

The event was due to take place on 27 June 2020, but has been postponed until 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Protests Armed Forces Day is regularly challenged by pacifist and anti-war groups. The Peace Pledge Union described the introduction of Armed Forces Day in 2009 as an example of \\"everyday militarism\\" through which military attitudes and organisations become more involved in civilian life.https://ppu.org.uk/militarism/armed- forces-day There have been protests and vigils against Armed Forces Day in various towns and cities. In 2018, the Peace Pledge Union claimed there were protests in more places than at any time since Armed Forces Day was introduced in the UK in 2009.https://ppu.org.uk/node/1 There has been particular criticism of the involvement of children in Armed Forces Day events, with some objecting to situations in which small children are invited to handle real weapons.https://ppu.org.uk/node/1 In Northern Ireland, there is much support for Armed Forces Day from the unionist community. However, each year the flying of Armed Forces Day flags from council buildings has met with opposition, due to some of the actions of the British Army during The Troubles. The opposition has come from Irish nationalist/republican groups, and from the families of those who were victims of the British Army.\\"Statement by Sinn Fein on 'Armed Forces' flag at Belfast City Hall\\".

Released on September 15, 1989 by Epic Productions, the film was written by Spencer Eastman and directed by Peter Masterson. Plot A number of young women are found dead on or around the beaches of Galveston and the one thing they all have in common is that they were murdered when Houston Astros ace pitcher Silvio Baretto (an amalgamation of real-life pitchers Bob Knepper and Juan Agosto) pitches and wins a night game at the Astrodome. Additionally, each victim had her throat slashed by some sort of knife or hook. Scheider plays former minor league baseball player turned Galveston homicide detective Mike Seaver. Seaver is a staunch Astros fan and is the only person on the case who begins to realize the coincidence of the deaths coming after Sil Barretto's night game wins in the Dome. After 95 minutes of sleuthing, Seaver ultimately realizes that the murderer is a disgruntled former Astros pitcher named Floyd Epps. Epps had lost his pitching hand in a minor league bus accident and now wears a hook. He personally, if illogically, blames Sil Baretto for his misfortune and decides that his murders on the same night as Baretto's wins will steal the headlines from his former teammate. The penultimate scene features Seaver shooting and killing Epps at a Galveston beach front restaurant. Epps has been attempting to murder Seaver's fiancee, Roxy, but the swings of his hook prove to be as wild as his mental state, and he fails. The final scene of the film features Sil Barretto walking off the mound before the start of a game in the Astrodome to lead the entire stadium in a standing ovation for the newly married Seaver and Roxy who are standing behind the dugout. Cast * Roy Scheider as Mike Seaver * Karen Young as Roxy * Richard Bradford as Nelson * Matt Carlson as Diddee * Michelle Cochran as Cindy Baretto * Alex Garcia as Sil Baretto * Paul Gleason as Broussard * Carlin Glynn as Alma * Rex Linn as Epps * Alex Morris as Gries * Anthony Palmer as Mendoza * Lane Smith as Witty * Renee O'Connor as Lorraine Beasley *James Black as Dale Critical reception Upon its release, Night Game was neither a critical nor a box office success. The New York Times review of the movie on September 16, 1989 read, \\"Maybe Roy Scheider should go back to chasing sharks. His career has taken a long, slow dive from his days as the harassed police chief in Jaws and the tortured Broadway director in All That Jazz. In fact, it seems to have hit bottom in Night Game.\\" The review further stated, \\"It's hard to see what could have been done to liven up Night Game, short of having someone run into the Galveston Police Department yelling 'Shark!' Too bad no one does.\\" Notes The movie was filmed entirely in Galveston and Houston and features such landmarks as the Galveston Seawall, Galveston Cotton Exchange (which is seen as the fictional Galveston Police headquarters), the San Luis Hotel, the Balinese Room (where Epps is killed), Galveston County Daily News compound (including some of the police station scenes depicting the detective office space), the former Broadway Theater, and the Gulf Freeway. The poster for the movie features a shot of Tiger Stadium in Detroit during the 1984 World Series instead of the Houston Astrodome. Roy Scheider portrayed a Detroit player in a prior baseball film, Tiger Town. Behind the scenes The movie was covered in the July 1989 Houston Astros program on pages 58 and 59. An author is not listed. \\"Glenn Davis has proven repeatedly that he has a flair for the dramatic. With his consistent game- winning RBIs, one might say he almost performs on cue. And in August, he will prove it again, not only to Astros fans, but across America, when he belts a homer in the upcoming movie, Night Game. Parts of the movie were filmed in the Astrodome last year and director Peter Masterson says Davis proved to be the man he needed for a tricky plot twist. 'We needed an Astro to hit a home run and Davis was the one that hit it, so he got in the movie,' laughed Masterson in a call from his New York home.\\" \\"Night Game\\" was the first movie in years to be filmed in the Astrodome, joining \\"Brewster McCloud\\", a peculiar 1971 Robert Altman film largely shot in the stadium, \\"The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training\\", and \\"Murder at the World Series\\", an ABC-TV movie of the week that featured the Astros in a World Series before they had even won a division championship. This newest movie is also a murder mystery. Roy Scheider plays a Galveston detective who is cheering for the Astros in the midst of a tight pennant race. But one problem, he is assigned to track down a serial killer. And Scheider is discovering that the murders take place on the same night that Houston wins games. \\"Night Game\\" was originally scripted to be set in San Francisco, but Masterson, a Houston native, who has also made \\"The Trip to Bountiful\\" and wrote \\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\\", decided to bring the movie to Texas. 'It seemed more interesting to bring it to Houston. A lot of movies are made in San Francisco and not as many in Houston or Galveston,' the director said. 'I think it worked out better; it's a different kind of locale.' Critical to the movie was the availability of the Dome, he said. Filming during the games was limited to capturing crowd reaction, wide- angle shots of the teams and the occasional player at bat. Dodgers outfielder Mike Marshall was, like Davis, expected to hit a homer, Masterson said. But the director found that dingers in the Dome aren't all that common. 'We tried our best, but he didn't cooperate,' Masterson smiled, admitting that he had to resort to footage of a Marshall single and 'we cut real quick after the crack of the bat to crowd shots.' Much more Dome footage will involve players no one is familiar with though. Masterson said former Astro Norm Miller, now a team executive, arranged for squads of amateur players to imitate the pros. 'After games ended, we got the field. We simulated some on-the-field stuff and got the close ups we needed,' Masterson recalled. 'We worked until dawn every night. As soon as it got too light, we'd have to quit.' In addition to present and past Astro stars, Houstonians will also recognize one more local figure in the movie. Bob Allen, the sports director at KTRK-TV Channel 13 plays the Astros' play-by-play broadcaster. Masterson said the anchorman 'did a really good job.'

Born in Rip, Maba was a disciple of the Tijaniyya Sufi brotherhood and became the Almami of Saloum. A descendant of the Fulani Denianke Dynasty, from the branch of the B√¢ family in the region of Badibou, Maba Diakhou B√¢ combined political and religious goals in an attempt to reform or overthrow previous animist monarchies, and resist French encroachment. He is in a tradition of Fulani jihad leaders who revolutionized the states of West Africa at the time of colonialism. Maba Diakhou B√¢ founded the city of Nioro in Rip. The village of Keur Maba Diakhou near Kaolack is named for him. Resistance and conquest Maba Diakhou B√¢ mounted a fierce resistance to the French colonial invasions of Senegal. Under governor Faidherbe French forces had carried out a scorched-earth policy against resistance to their expansion in the Senegambia, with villages razed and populations removed after each victory. Throughout the founding of an Islamic state, Maba Diakhou B√¢ tried to unify the area north of the Gambia, while leading a war of conversion against the traditional states. After meeting El Hadj Umar Tall around 1850, Maba Diakhou B√¢ launched his jihad into Serer territory from his small state of Rip in 1861. While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century. There is much to suggest that Sine resistance was as much nationalist as religious, with Muslims and animists fighting on both sides of these struggles.Leonardo Alfonso Villal√≥n. Islamic Society and State Power in Senegal: Disciples and Citizens in Fatick. Cambridge (1995) . pp. 61‚Äì63. =Battle of Rip (1865)= On 30 November 1865, with the help of Lat Dior and his Cayor forces, Maba Diakhou B√¢ began the conquest of the states of Sine, Baol and Djolof. =Siege of Kaolack (1865)= Later at Kaolack, Maba and Lat Dior were checked by a combined force of French under Pinet-Laprade of 2000 cavalry and 4000 colonial infantry, allied with 1000 infantry and 500 cavalry from the states of Waalo, Ndiambour and Ndiander. Islamization and reform As well as converting traditional states to Islam, Maba Diakhou B√¢'s forces sought to abolish the traditional caste system of the Wolof and Serer aristocratic states. In unifying with other Muslim forces, West African Jihad states aimed to end the reign of small regional kingships who kept the area in a constant state of war, and the farming and artisanal classes in slave conditions. The Toucouleur Empire of El Hadj Umar Tall in Mali, which rose at about the same time had much the same goals, and Umar Tall himself was in contact with and recruited among Maba Diakhou B√¢'s forces.Bradford G. Martin. Muslim Brotherhoods in Nineteenth- Century Africa. Cambridge (2003), p.78 Lat Dior After Lat Dior, the young king of Wolof Cayor was defeated by the French at the Battle of Loro (1864), Maba Diakhou B√¢ offered him asylum, and converted Dior and his soldiers from the traditional Ti√®ddo animism to Islam. While his conversion may have been for reasons more political than spiritual, Lat Dior became a powerful ally even in exile, leading his forces alongside those of Sine. In 1867, Lat Dior and Maba Diakhou B√¢ reconquered Cayor from the king placed there by the French. Governor Pinet-Laprade had little choice but to accede to Lat Dior, confirming him as the French chef de canton. Death and legacy In 1867, Maba Diakhou B√¢ was killed leading forces against the animist Serer state of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof. By 1871, the Serer had re-instated their traditional monarchy, which was soon to be supplanted by the French. Maba Diakhou B√¢ is an important link in the tradition of Senegalese marabouts who trace their lineage to Umar Tall. This tradition has continued to the present, with such notables as El Hadj Saidou Nourou Tall (the former grand marabout of French West Africa) the Tivaouane-based Sy family of El Hadj Malik Sy (1855‚Äì1922), and the Niass family of Abdoulaye Niass (1840‚Äì1922) and his son Ibrahim Niass in Kaolack. Tivaouane in the north among the Wolof and Kaolack among the Serer have become the two centers of Tijaniyyah Sufi teaching in Senegal, and both were founded as a direct result of Maba Diakhou B√¢'s short-lived state. He was interred in the village of Fand√®ne (or Mbel Fandane), and his tomb, which has become a place of pilgrimage, is in the Diakhao Arrondissement, d√©partement of Fatick in Sine-Saloum, S√©n√©gal.

Its first stage was opened in September 1839 and is thus the oldest railway line in the German state of Hesse and one of the oldest in Germany. Today it is used by Regional-Express trains between Frankfurt and Wiesbaden and the trains of line S1 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn between Frankfurt-H√∂chst and Wiesbaden. Between Frankfurt Hbf (Frankfurt central station) and Frankfurt-H√∂chst, they run on the line of the former Hessian Ludwig Railway.  History  Location of the Taunusbahnhof on the western outskirts of the town of Frankfurt on an 1845 map The Taunusbahnhof in Frankfurt and its neighbouring stations around 1860 The building of the line was preceded by many years of negotiations between the three sovereigns states through which the planned line ran: the Free City of Frankfurt, the Duchy of Nassau (of which Wiesbaden was capital) and the Grand Duchy of Hesse for the section in Mainz-Kastel, a suburb of Mainz on the eastern bank of the Rhine. In particular the Grand Duchy opposed its building, because it feared a loss of traffic to the port of Mainz as a result of the connection with the other two states and demanded instead rail connections between Frankfurt and its own cities of Darmstadt, Mainz and Offenbach. In the end they agreed on the current route. A consortium to build the railway was established in 1835 under the leadership of the two Frankfurt banks Gebr√ºder Bethmann and Rothschild. The shares that it issued were immediately oversubscribed 40 times, enabling work to begin in 1837. Nevertheless, the final concession was not approved until 1838: by the City of Frankfurt on 8 May, by the Grand Duchy of Hessen on 11 May and by Nassau on 13 June. The private Taunus Railway Company (Taunus- Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) was established on 12 August 1838 in Frankfurt/Main. Paul Camille von Denis, a Bavarian, born in Mainz, who had worked on the first German railway, the Bavarian Ludwigsbahn between Nuremberg and F√ºrth (opened in 1835), designed the route. =Operations= The first stage was opened on 26 September 1839 from the Taunus station in Gallusanlage (now Willy-Brandt- Platz), Frankfurt, to the then small Nassau town of H√∂chst am Main by the Mainz masterbuilder, Ignaz Opfermann. The railway reached Hattersheim am Main on 24 November 1839 and Mainz-Kastel on 13 April 1840. The extension to the Wiesbaden Taunus station on the Rheinstra√üe was opened 19 May 1840. It was the ninth railway line opened in Germany. The new railway line immediately led to changes in transport flows, while the losers from this development ‚Äì especially in Mainz ‚Äì vigorously defended themselves in an incident called the Nebeljungenstreich‚Äî\\"fog-boyish-prank\\"‚Äîwhen Mainz merchants sabotaged the port at Biebrich. Carting companies and drivers of the region, fearing for their income undertook an attack in Mainz-Kastel, on the line and damaged the tracks. They were prevented at gunpoint from inflicting more damage. The director of the company from 1840 to 1852 was Johann Adam Beil, a Hessian privy councillor and former Frankfurt senator. The line was originally 43.4 kilometres long. A 6.6 kilometres branch from H√∂chst to Bad Soden (the Soden Railway) opened in 1863. Originally the railway operated six locomotives from the factory of George and Robert Stephenson, 87 carriages and 44 wagons. The first engine drivers were British. =Ownership change= The Taunus Railway suffered from competition from the Frankfurt‚ÄìMainz line (opened on the south bank of the Main in 1863) and it decided to sell its company to the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessischen Ludwigsbahn, HLB) in 1871. The HLB took over the enterprise with effect from 1 January 1872, but it sold it on to the Prussian state railways, which took it over on 3 May 1872. In 1888, the line in Frankfurt was shortened by about a kilometre when it was diverted from its old railway terminal to the new Frankfurt Central Station (Hauptbahnhof). The same happened in 1906 at the Wiesbaden end, where the current Wiesbaden Central Station replaced the old Taunus station. =Operations after the First World War= In 1920, the line was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. It attained great importance for long distance, regional and suburban passenger traffic and to a lesser extent in freight traffic. =Operation after the Second World War= The railway line was badly damaged in the Second World War, particularly in the area of the central stations in Wiesbaden and Frankfurt and in the Mainz-Kastel area. After its repair and the resumption of operations, it re-established its former importance, with increasing freight traffic on the line, especially on the section from Kostheim junction to Wiesbaden East station. By the end of 1970 the line had achieved considerable importance for long-distance traffic. The Deutsche Bundesbahn timetable in 1970 included a long-distance service from Wiesbaden to Bremerhaven-Lehe. With the introduction of the two-class Intercity (IC) network in 1979, every second IC train ran from Cologne to Frankfurt via Wiesbaden and the Taunus Railway. The time lost as a result of operating through the terminal station at Wiesbaden, which at the time still required the exchange of locomotives, and the increasing aspiration to integrate Frankfurt Airport in the regular- interval network of the IC movement led to a gradual depletion of the major connections on the line, as the route via Mainz did not need a change in direction and running times could thus be shortened. In the early 1990s, the long-distance traffic on the Taunus Railway was operated only by single IC commuter trains between Frankfurt and Wiesbaden, which was eventually discontinued for lack of demand. With the founding of the Frankfurter Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund (Frankfurt Transport and Fares Association), the line was included in its fare structure. Line S 1 of the Rhine-Main S-Bahn started operations on the line in May 1978, although this service does not run on the Taunus Railway runs between Frankfurt-H√∂chst and Frankfurt Central Station, instead it uses the Main-Lahn Railway. In addition, express trains operated on the route, in some cases to/from Koblenz. In 1980, services of S-Bahn line S 14 (called S 8 service since 1995) commenced on the section between Wiesbaden Ost and Wiesbaden Central Station. In 1995, the Rhein-Main- Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV) replaced the FVV, and simultaneously introduced the new Regional-Express line 90 (the former express trains were now rebranded as Regional-Expresses, abbreviated as RE), which used the Taunus Railway from Wiesbaden Central Station to Kostheim junction. At the timetable change in the summer of 2000, the RE-90 service was discontinued due to poor loadings and replaced on the same section by the new S 9 service. The RE 10 service (Neuwied‚ÄìKoblenz‚ÄìWiesbaden‚ÄìFrankfurt) now run largely hourly, even during peak hours, sometimes every half-hour. There are no longer any scheduled long-distance passenger services on the line, only the Wiesbaden Ost‚ÄìWiesbaden Hauptbahnhof section is still regularly used by long- distance trains. In 1970, Deutsche Bundesbahn presented a development program, which included two connecting curves from a new Cologne‚ÄìGross-Gerau line, connecting to Frankfurt, Mainz and Wiesbaden. During the 1992 regional planning process for the high-speed line between Cologne and the Rhine/Main, the so-called Eddersheim curve was proposed southwest of Eddersheim to connect the high-speed line with the Taunus Railway to/from Frankfurt. The curve, which would have had a radius of 975 m, was not ultimately built.  Infrastructure  = Frankfurt Taunusbahnhof (Taunus station)= Frankfurt Taunusbahnhof was the historical starting point of the Taunus Railway and was replaced in 1888 by the new Centralbahnhof (central station), now: Hauptbahnhof (main station). = Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof = Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof (line-kilometre 0.0) has been the starting point of the line since 1888 and is the point from which chainage is currently calculated. = Frankfurt main freight yard = The western entrance to the Frankfurt main freight yard (Hauptg√ºterbahnhof) was located at line-kilometre 6.1. After this was abandoned, the access route was closed. = Nied railway bridge = Nidda bridge of the Taunus Railway The Nied railway bridge (line-kilometre 8,5) is the second oldest railway bridge still in operation in Germany. = Frankfurt- H√∂chst = H√∂chst station, 1846 The second H√∂chst station, built in 1880 and in operation until 1914 In Frankfurt-H√∂chst (line-kilometre 9.3), the Main- Lahn Railway crosses the Taunus railway and the K√∂nigstein Railway and the Soden Railway branch off here. The latter is a 6.6-kilometre-long branch line to Bad Soden am Taunus, which was operated from its opening in 1847 by the Taunus Railway and taken over by it in 1862/63. = Frankfurt-H√∂chst Farbwerke = Frankfurt-H√∂chst Farbwerke (line-kilometre 10.4) is a part (Bahnhofsteil, Bft) of Frankfurt-H√∂chst station. When it was opened in 1967, it was designated as Farbwerke Hoechst, but after the dissolution of the Hoechst dye works, it was renamed Frankfurt-H√∂chst Farbwerke. = Frankfurt-Sindlingen = The halt of Frankfurt-Sindlingen (line-kilometre 12.2) serves the district of Frankfurt-Sindlingen. It was opened as Sindlingen-Zeilsheim in 1893. The original entrance building was replaced by a new one in 1968, which, however, was completely burned down after an explosion on 29 February 1984. = Schwarzbach bridge = The Taunus railway crosses the Schwarzbach (line- kilometre 14.8) about 100 metres northeast of the Hattersheim (Main) station on a rather nondescript two-arch sandstone bridge. The bridge dates from the origin of the railway from 1839 and is thus‚Äîlike the Nied railway bridge‚Äîone of the oldest still operating railway bridges in Germany. It was based on a design by Paul Camille von Denis. The bridge was renovated with concrete in 1911. It is heritage-listed under the Hessian Monument Protection Act. = Hattersheim (Main) = Hattersheim (Main) station (line-kilometre 14.9) was built with the line. The station building dates back to the beginning of 1842. = Eddersheim = The halt of Eddersheim (line-kilometre 18.9) serves the Eddersheim district of Hattersheim am Main. = Fl√∂rsheim (Main) = Fl√∂rsheim station Fl√∂rsheim (Main) station (line-kilometre 21.9) serves the town of Fl√∂rsheim am Main. The main entrance building, although rebuilt several times, dates from the first year of the line, 1839. = Fl√∂rsheim Taubertsm√ºhle = The Fl√∂rsheim tank farm of Deutschen Shell AG is connected by a siding from Fl√∂rsheim Taubertsm√ºhle junction (line-kilometre 25.0). = Hochheim (Main) = Hochheim (Main) station (line-kilometre 28.4) serves the town of Hochheim am Main. = Kostheim = Kostheim junction: the Mainz rail bypass is on the left and the Taunus Railway is on the right Mainz rail bypass meets the Taunus railway at Kostheim junction (line-kilometre 30.8). The associated signal box building has been preserved. It stands side-gabled to the south of the tracks and was put into operation in 1904 together with the Mainz rail bypass. A few metres east of the signal box was a listed building pedestrian bridge, also from 1904, that crossed the tracks. It was demolished with the building of Kommerzienrat-Disch Bridge, a road bridge that still connects the main street of Mainz-Kostheim with Hochheimer Stra√üe (L 119). = Mainz-Kastel = Kastel station, entrance building on 13 April 1840 to the right with the first train towards Wiesbaden Mainz-Kastel station (line-kilometre 33.4) is now the most southerly station of Wiesbaden. From here there were two connections to the centre of Mainz: a pontoon bridge and the Mainz‚ÄìKastel train ferry. The construction of a railway bridge was not possible. Therefore, the Taunus Railway in cooperation with the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) opened the Mainz‚ÄìKastel train ferry with three steam-powered ferries in 1861. This was closed after the opening of the Mainz South Bridge (Mainzer S√ºdbr√ºcke) in 1863 but continued to operate as a passenger ferry until the opening of the fixed Mainz road bridge on 30 May 1885. = Wiesbaden Ost = Branch line to the Rhine station in Biebrich and the Mainz‚ÄìKastel train ferry Wiesbaden Ost (east) station (line-kilometre 37.8) was originally called Biebrich Curve and 'was later called Biebrich Ost. After the incorporation of Biebrich into Wiesbaden, \\"Wiesbaden\\" was added to its name in 1927, but \\"Biebrich\\" was deleted in 1934 and only \\"Ost\\" was maintained in the station name. This led to a geographically incorrect name as the station is located in the south of Wiesbaden. From 18 September 1862, there was a connection from Curve station to Nassau Rhine Railway (Nassauische Rheinbahn), which since 1856 had run down the Rhine to R√ºdesheim in the Rheingau. This link is now in regular use only by freight trains. A brief period of operation with long- distance trains, which, in order to shorten the travel time, only stopped in Wiesbaden-Biebrich, bypassing Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof, was discontinued because of insufficient demand.Timetables of Deutsche Bundesbahn and Deutsche Bahn A branch line branched off in Wiesbaden Ost to Biebrich, later called Rheinbahnhof (Rhine station; see below). = Biebrich =  Branch line to Biebrich  On 3 August 1840 a 1.5 kilometre-long branch line was opened to Biebrich, which was operated by horse-drawn traffic until 14 May 1872. The line was shortened in 1908 and the station was relocated accordingly. From then on, the line was only used for freight traffic, as travellers to Wiesbaden, who arrived by ship, could be transported by the Wiesbaden steam tramway, operated by the South German Railway Company (S√ºddeutsche Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, SEG) from 1889. The branch still exists today as an industrial siding from the Kalle-Albert industrial park.  Biebrich / Rheinufer station  The terminal station of Biebrich (not to be confused with the current Wiesbaden-Biebrich station on the Right Rhine line), later called Rheinbahnhof (Rhine station), lay at the end of a branch line on the Rhine bank in Biebrich. It was particularly important in the early days for rail freight operations and was in the immediate vicinity of the customs office on the Rhine bank. The opening of the link triggered the so-called fog prank (Nebeljungenstreich) in 1841. With this act of sabotage Mainz merchants attempted to block access to the free port of Biebrich to remove the competitive advantage of the railway. The station's entrance building was rather simple: a two-storey building on a rectangular floor plan with a clock tower on the ridge. It resembled the central buildings of the main stations in Wiesbaden and Frankfurt, which had also been planned by Ignaz Opfermann. This first building was demolished in 1908 and replaced by a new building on today's Wilhelm-Kalle-Stra√üe, which today is being used by the employee health insurance company of the Chemische Fabrik Kalle. = Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof = The Taunus Railway has ended in Wiesbaden Hauptbahnhof (line-kilometre 41.2) since 1906. = Wiesbaden Taunusbahnhof = From 1840 to 1906, the Taunus Railway ended at the Taunus station (Taunusbahnhof; line-kilometre ca. 43), before it was replaced by today's Hauptbahnhof. Rail services VIAS service on line SE 10 near the entrance to Mainz-Kastel station Both regional and express services were operated with Silberling carriages, hauled by class 140 or 141 locomotives and occasionally by other classes, while long-distance services were hauled mainly by class 103, 110 and later 112 locomotives. The IC commuter trains in the late 1990s consisted of 2 to 3 carriages, hauled by a class 141 locomotive. As early as the mid-1970s, prior to the inauguration of the S-Bahn, trains were also operated by class 420 electric multiple units. After the conversion to S-Bahn operations, all S-Bahn services were operated with these trains. Class 420 sets are still used overwhelmingly on lines S 8 and S 9, while line S 1 has been operated since 2004 almost exclusively with class 423 multiple units. Line S 1 was thus one of the first lines to be operated by the new S-Bahn trains. These trains were put on the line so that commuters to Frankfurt could avoid extensive construction work on the autobahn to Frankfurt, using the most comfortable trains with the operator hoping to retain them as permanent customers. After the founding of the Deutsche Bahn in 1994, the class 140 locomotives were withdrawn from freight traffic, so that they were increasingly replaced, initially by locomotives of class 110 and later by class 143, which are currently used almost exclusively for RE services on the line. Since the timetable change in December 2010, Stadt- Express services have been operated on the route of the Taunus Railway and the Right Rhine Railway by the Frankfurt-based company, VIAS. 19 Stadler FLIRT low-floor trains are used on this line. These replaced the Regional-Express services operated by Deutsche Bahn, so that between Koblenz and Wiesbaden, all stops are served hourly. At peak times services between Frankfurt and Wiesbaden are operated every half hour.

His highest rank was sandanme 6. Career At 46 years of age, Ichinoya was the oldest man in professional sumo since the start of the Sh≈çwa era in 1926. When he began his sumo career in November 1983 his stablemate, former yokozuna Asash≈çry≈´ was just three years old. He was the oldest wrestler in sumo for 62 tournaments, from the retirement of Dairy≈´ in July 1997 until his own retirement in November 2007. Ichinoya was interested in sumo from a very young age. He grew up on Tokunoshima island, which was the birthplace of the 46th Yokozuna Asashio Tar≈ç III. He studied physics at Ryukyu University in Okinawa, and started up a sumo club there. Upon graduation he attempted to enter professional sumo but was turned away by a number of stables due to lack of height (at 166 cm he was below the minimum requirement of 173 cm). After help from Wakamatsu Oyakata (the former Fusanishiki) he moved into Wakamatsu stable and did chores there and worked on stretching exercises before making his official debut in the November 1983 tournament. In July 1989 he became the first graduate of a national university to win a y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship when he took the jonidan division title.\\"Ichinoya is 1st National University Grad to Take Yusho\\", Sumo World, September 1989. In 1990 his stable master retired due to ill health and was replaced by the former Asashio Tar≈ç IV. In 2002 Wakamatsu stable merged with Takasago stable. He never rose higher than the fourth sandanme division, but he was much admired simply for his longevity and his determination in fighting opponents more than twenty years his junior. At the tournament in May 2007, ranked at Jonidan 87, he fought back from 0-3 down to achieve a 4‚Äì3 score and kachi-koshi. In November 2007, having completed 1000 professional bouts, he announced that he was retiring after 24 years in sumo.http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/sports/20071126TDY20105.htm He also announced his intention to marry. Ichinoya remained as the general manager of Takasago stable, looking after its day-to-day running. He is also a keen computer enthusiast and keeps a regular blog on the heya's website. In February 2008 Ichinoya had his retirement ceremony, or danpatsu-shiki, at a hotel in Tokyo, along with his wedding reception. Asash≈çry≈´ was among the attendees. Interviewed in 2020 upon the occasion of his successor as oldest wrestler since the Showa era, Hanakaze, turning 50, Ichinoya (now known as Tetsuhiro Matsuda again) argued that although older wrestlers may not contribute much to sumo in sporting terms, they were important to the successful running of stables and the hosting of the tournaments.

HB-EGF-like growth factor is synthesized as a membrane-anchored mitogenic and chemotactic glycoprotein. An epidermal growth factor produced by monocytes and macrophages, due to an affinity for heparin is termed HB-EGF. It has been shown to play a role in wound healing, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart development and function. First identified in the conditioned media of human macrophage-like cells, HB-EGF is an 87-amino acid glycoprotein that displays highly regulated gene expression. Ectodomain shedding results in the soluble mature form of HB-EGF, which influences the mitogenicity and chemotactic factors for smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. The transmembrane form of HB- EGF is the unique receptor for diphtheria toxin and functions in juxtacrine signaling in cells. Both forms of HB-EGF participate in normal physiological processes and in pathological processes including tumor progression and metastasis, organ hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic disease. HB-EGF can bind two locations on cell surfaces: heparan sulfate proteoglycans and EGF-receptor effecting cell to cell interactions. Interactions Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor has been shown to interact with NRD1, Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16 and BAG1. HB-EGF biological activities with these genes influence cell cycle progression, molecular chaperone regulation, cell survival, cellular functions, adhesion, and mediation of cell migration. The NRD1 gene codes for the protein nardilysin, an HB-EGF modulator. Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 16 and BAG family molecular chaperone regulator function as co-chaperone proteins in processes involving HB-EGF.  Role in cancer  Recent studies indicate significant HB-EGF gene expression elevation in a number of human cancers as well as cancer-derived cell lines. Evidence indicates that HB-EGF plays a significant role in the development of malignant phenotypes contributing to the metastatic and invasive behaviors of tumors. The proliferative and chemotactic effects of HB-EGF results from the target influence on particular cells including fibroblasts, smooth muscles cells, and keratinocytes. For numerous cell types such as breast and ovarian tumor cells, human epithelial cells and keratinocytes HB-EGF is a potent mitogen resulting in evidenced upregulation of HB-EGF in such specimens. Both in vivo and in vitro studies of tumor formation in cancer derived cell lines indicate that expression of HB-EGF is essential for tumor development. As a result, studies implementing the use of specific HB-EGF inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies against HB-EGF show the potential for the development of novel therapies for treating cancers by targeting HB-EGF expression.  Role in cardiac development and vasculature  HB-EGF binding and activation of EGF receptors plays a critical role during cardiac valve tissue development and the maintenance of normal heart function in adults. During valve tissue development the interaction of HB-EGF with EGF receptors and heparan sulfate proteoglycans is essential for the prevention of malformation of valves due to enlargement. In the vascular system areas of disturbed flow show upregulation of HB-EGF with promotion of vascular lesions, atherogenesis, and hyperplasia of intimal tissue in vessels. The flow disturbance remodeling of the vascular tissues due to HB-EGF expression contributes to aortic valve disease, peripheral vascular disease, and conduit stenosis.  Role in wound healing  HB-EGF is the predominant growth factor in the epithelialization required for cutaneous wound healing. The mitogenic and migratory effects of HB-EGF on keratinocytes and fibroblasts promotes dermal repair and angiogenesis necessary for wound healing and is a major component of wound fluids. HB-EGF displays target cell specificity during the early stages of wound healing being released by macrophages, monocytes, and keratinoctyes. HB-EGF cell surface binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans enhances mitogen promoting capabilities increasing the rate of skin wound healing, decreasing human skin graft healing times, and promotes rapid healing of ulcers, burns, and epidermal split thickness wounds.  Role in other physiological processes  HB-EGF is recognized as an important component for the modulation of cell activity in various biological interactions. Found widely distributed in cerebral neurons and neuroglia, HB-EGF induced by brain hypoxia and or ischemia subsequently stimulates neurogenesis. Interactions between uterine HB-EGF and epidermal growth factor receptors of blastocysts influence embryo- uterine interactions and implantation. Studies show HB-EGF protects intestinal stem cells and intestinal epithelial cells in necrotizing enterocolitis, a disease affecting premature newborns. Associated with a breakdown in gut barrier function, necrotizing enterocolitis may be mediated by HB-EGF effects on intestinal mucosa. HB-EGF expressed during skeletal muscle contraction facilitates peripheral glucose removal, glucose tolerance and uptake. The upregulation of HB-EGF with exercise may explain the molecular basis for the decrease in metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes with regular exercise.

The 132nd returned to the United States and was demobilized on 31 May 1919 at Camp Grant, Illinois, and inactivated that same year. The unit reorganized between 1920-1921 in the Illinois National Guard at Chicago as the 2nd Infantry Regiment, while its regimental headquarters was federally recognized on 7 July 1921 at Chicago.

On March 6 it sailed again, arriving in New Caledonia, where it became an infantry component of the newly created Americal Division on May 24, 1942. The 132nd Infantry arrived on Guadalcanal on December 8, 1942, where it engaged in combat in the Guadalcanal campaign, including fierce fighting to capture Japanese positions in the Battle of Mount Austen. The Regiment was relieved and sent to Fiji with the rest of the Americal Division to rest and refit. The 132nd next fought in the Bougainville campaign. It arrived at Cape Torokina on January 9, 1944, and relieved the 3rd Marine Parachute Battalion, the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion, and units of the 145th Infantry, which then reverted to the 37th Division. The 132nd Infantry took over that portion of the perimeter paralleling the Torokina on the extreme right flank and engaged in patrolling and in strengthening defensive positions. On April 5, 1944, after establishing patrols along Empress Augusta Bay, the 132nd successfully launched an attack to capture Mavavia Village. Two days later, while continuing a sweep for enemy forces, the Regiment encountered prepared enemy defenses, where they destroyed some twenty Japanese pillboxes using pole charges and bazookas. Later, the 132nd secured the heights west of Saua River in fierce fighting that lasted until April 18, when the last of the Japanese defenders were killed or driven off.Gailey, Harry A., Bougainville, 1943-1945: The Forgotten Campaign, University Press of Kentucky (2003), , , p. 171 In 1945, the 132nd participated in the retaking of the Philippine Islands. On March 26, 1945, preceded by a heavy naval and aerial bombardment, troops of the 3rd Battalion, 132nd Infantry waded ashore across heavily mined beaches during an amphibious invasion of Cebu Island, at a point just south of Cebu City.

The foundation of much of the work was the use of computational infrastructure that was collaboratively provisioned and worked across organisational boundaries. Collaboration was key and the computational approach was commonly known as 'Grid Computing'. e-Social Science refers to the use of enhanced computer and information technology infrastructure and tools for social science. The role of NCeSS was to investigate specific applications of e-Social Science, develop tools to support them and to advise on the future strategic direction of e-Social Science and e-Science more generally. NCeSS also provided information, training, advice, support and on- line resources to help the social science research community adopt e-Social Science approaches. NCeSS developed a portal based e-Infrastructure based on Sakai to support e-Social Science, but it was short lived due to lack of resources for sustaining it. NCeSS was coordinated from the University of Manchester, and involved groups from various other UK universities. The NCeSS research programme included applications of e-Science in both quantitative and qualitative social sciences, and studies of issues relevant to promoting the wider adoption of e-Science.

Johan Peringski√∂ld (October 6, 1654 - March 24, 1720) was a Swedish antiquarian. Biography Johan Peringer was born at Str√§ngn√§s in S√∂dermanland County, Sweden. His father Lars Fredrik Peringer (1613-1687) was senior master at the gymnasium. His elder brother Gustaf Lillieblad (1651‚Äì1710) was a Swedish orientalist, professor and librarian. He began his studies at Uppsala University in 1677 and he was an ardent student of the national antiquities. In 1680, he received a position at the newly established college of antiquities. He advanced to the position of clerk at the college in 1682, and he could then accompany Johan Hadorph (1630-1693) on scientific excursions in the countryside, during which he listed and made drawings of runestones, hill forts, grave fields and other prehistoric monuments. In 1689, he was appointed deputy judge, and in 1693, he was knighted and received the surname Peringski√∂ld as a sign of his nobility. In 1693, he was also appointed secretary of the college of antiquities, a task which was added to his work as a translator of Icelandic sources. In 1711, he left the work as translator to his son Johan Fredrik Peringski√∂ld (1689‚Äì1725) and in 1719, he applied to be removed from his offices. The request was granted and he received instead the title of chancellor, and the following year, he died. He assiduously created an extensive collection on his country's history, but some of it was destroyed in the fire of Stockholm Palace in 1697. What remains of his work is stored in the Swedish national archives and library. Like that of most historians of his time, his work lacked the scholarly criticism of modern days. He died in Stockholm. References Other sources *Hofberg, H; Heurlin, F; Millqvist, V; Rubenson, O. (1909). Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon, tome II. p. 296 and p. 297.

The black swan is also of spiritual significance in the traditional histories of many Australian Aboriginal peoples across southern Australia. Metaphoric references to black swans have appeared in European culture since long before Europeans became aware of Cygnus atratus in Australia in the 18th century. The black swan is the official state emblem of Western Australia and is depicted on the flag of Western Australia, as well as being depicted on the Western Australian coat- of-arms. The symbol is used in other emblems, coins, logos, mascots and in the naming of sports teams.  Aboriginal history and lore  Aboriginal hunters and black swan, by Tommy McRae, v. 1865 Daisy Bates recorded a nyoongar man called Woolberr \\"last of the black swan group\\" of the Nyungar people of south- western Australia in the 1920s.Bates, D.M. 'Woolberr: the last of the black swan group', in the Australasian, 3 May 1927. Totemic ceremony of the black swan of the Bibbulmun group; the life story of native who was born during an initiation ceremony (AIATSIS)Aboriginal Pages The website of the Premier of Western Australia refers to Nyungar lore of how the ancestors of the Nyungar people were once black swans who became men.Western Australian Government The Dreamtime story of the black swans tells how two brothers were turned into white swans so they could help an attack party during a raid for weapons. It is said that Wurrunna used a large gubbera, or crystal stone, to transform the men. After the raid, eaglehawks attacked the white swans and tore feathers from the birds. Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came to the aid of the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers. The black swan's red beak is said to be the blood of the attacked brothers, which stayed there forever.THE BLACK SWANS (extracted from Australian Legendary Tales, by K Langloh Parker). Retrieved 10 February 2007. The moral code embedded in Aboriginal lore is evident in a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, he wanted to take the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the angry mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found that they had been changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.Hurley, P.J., In Search of Australia, Dymocks Book Arcade Ltd., Sydney 1943: 131  European myth and metaphor  The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote in AD 82 of rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno (\\"a rare bird in the lands, and very like a black swan\\").Morris, E.E. (Ed), Austral English, Melbourne 1898; facsimile as Morris‚Äôs Dictionary of Australian Words, John Currey O‚ÄôNeil Publishers, Adelaide 1982: 451 He meant something whose rarity would compare with that of a black swan, or in other words, as a black swan did not exist, neither did the supposed characteristics of the \\"rare bird\\" with which it was being compared. The phrase passed into several European languages as a popular proverb, including English, in which the first four words (\\"a rare bird in the land\\") are often used ironically. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination as a metaphor for that which could not exist. Willem de Vlamingh's ships, with black swans, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia, coloured engraving (1726), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696‚Äì97 The Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh made the first European record of sighting a black swan in 1697, when he sailed into, and named, the Swan River on the western coast of New Holland. The sighting was significant in Europe, where \\"all swans are white\\" had long been used as a standard example of a well-known truth. In 1726, two birds were captured near Dirk Hartog Island, north of the Swan River, and taken to Batavia (now Jakarta) as proof of their existence. Governor Phillip, soon after establishing the convict settlement some sixty years later and away at Botany Bay on the east coast, wrote in 1789 that \\"A black swan, which species, though proverbially rare in other parts of the world, is here by no means uncommon ... a very noble bird, larger than the common swan, and equally beautiful in form ... its wings were edged with white: the bill was tinged with red.\\" A contemporary, Surgeon-General John White, observed in 1790, \\"We found nine birds, that, whilst swimming, most perfectly resembled the rara avis of the ancients, a black swan.\\" The taking of black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds into contact with another aspect of European mythology: the attribution of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat. Black swans were considered to be a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.Scott, Sir Peter (Ed), The World Atlas of Birds, Colporteur Press, Balmain 1982: 200 While the European encounter with the black swan along Australia's west coast in the late 17th and early 18th centuries led to the shattering of an age-old metaphor, their contact on the east coast in the late 18th and early 19th centuries merely confirmed the new post-proverbial view, before turning to account for the black swan as just one more curiosity in the South to be utilised in developing the colonies. In Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, the sinister and seductive black swan, Odile, is contrasted with the innocent white swan, Odette.  Western Australia  = Heraldry = The coat of arms of Western Australia includes a black swan as the principal charge on the shield. A black swan on a gold plate or disk has been the official badge of the state since 1876, and is shown on the flag of Western Australia. The coat of arms of Australia (1912 version) shows, in its fifth quarter, the black swan on a gold field, representing the state as one of the original states in the federation. Image from a Western Australia Planning Commission document; the motto refers to black swans. Although the State Arms were granted in 1969, municipal heraldry had already been using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a charge in the first quarter and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms granted by the Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state. In the history of the Western Australian Government Railways ‚Äì the black swan emblem occurred between the 1920s to the 1980sRob Clark The History of the 'Mucky Duck' pp.7 ‚Äì 21, issue 263, 2009/10 - Several state authorities have also been granted arms showing a black swan: St George's College at the University of Western Australia (1964, charges), Fremantle Port Authority (1965, crest), and the University of Western Australia (1972, charges). The university had used an assumed version of these arms since 1913, and the university's student guild reaffirmed its assumption and use of a differenced version of the University Arms in 1991.Annual Report 1991, Guild of Undergraduates, University of Western Australia, Crawley 1992: 6 Authorities with assumed arms showing a black swan include Royal Perth Hospital (1936, charge), and the University of Western Australia residential colleges of St Thomas More (charge), Currie Hall (charge) and St Catherines (charge). Religious authorities have also used representations of the black swan in their heraldic emblems. Of the two largest denominations in the state, there are the Anglican dioceses of Kalgoorlie (1956, charge) and North-West Australia (1956, charge); and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth (charge). = Philately = 1954 Australian stamp commemorating the first Western Australian stamp which featured the black swan The Colony of Western Australia produced its first postage stamps in 1854, and in contrast to the usual practice within the British Empire, they featured, not a portrait of Queen Victoria, but an image of the black swan. The design of the stamp underwent several modifications over the next 48 years, until 1902, when the last design was produced, although the swan stamps continued in use until 1913, when Australian stamps superseded the colonial/state issues. The most famous of the series was the four-penny Blue Inverted Swan produced in 1855, in which the central image was printed upside down. The stamp is now an acknowledged philatelic rarity, with only fifteen known to have survived.Eastick, M., Comprehensive Colour Catalogue of Australian Stamps, Victoria Stamp Traders, Malvern 2003: WA1-WA4 Stamp issues in all of the other British colonies in Australasia, such as New South Wales, featured royal portraits rather than local symbols, apart from some one-off commemorative issues. = Decorative arts = Black swans feature as emblems and decorations on most important public buildings in Western Australia. An example is the tower of the Fremantle Town Hall. The Wembley Ware range of \\"fancy ware\\" was produced between 1945 and 1961 by HL Brisbane and Wunderlich Ltd/Bristile in Subiaco. The Wembley Ware range typified the spirit of post-war buoyancy in Western Australia during the 1950s, with art ceramics specifically for a local market using emblems of local Westralian identity. The majority of the works were decorative rather than functional to escape high taxes on purely decorative ceramics at this time and exploited highly coloured glazes and overtly Australian content in their designs. The majority of Wembley Ware was created with an apparent intended purpose such as vases, ashtrays or lamps, but these were usually superfluous to the designs. Some of the most sought- after and eccentric designs included the open-mouthed dhufish vase and black swan ashtray. A variety of swan-shaped ashtrays and vases were produced in a range of sizes, colours and glazes.Stateline ‚Äì Western Australia ‚Äì Australian Broadcasting Corporation = Literature = Explorers' journals, as a literary genre, often provide descriptions of black swans. For example, in December 1836, Lieutenant Bunbury of the 21st Fusiliers was the first European to travel overland from Pinjarra to Busselton, describing the mudflats of the Leschenault Estuary at sunset covered by \\"...immense flocks of brown ducks and teal, while the water was equally covered with swans and pelicans.\\"Bunbury, Lt. Col. W. St Pierre and Morrell, W.P. (Eds), Early Days in Western Australia: being the letters and journal of Lieut. H. W. Bunbury, 21st Fusiliers, Oxford University Press, London 1930: 72 The early colonist George Fletcher Moore included in his 1831 ballad \\"So Western Australia for Me\\" the lines: > :No lions or tigers are we dread to meet, :Our innocent quadrupeds hop on > two feet; :No tithes and no taxes, we here have to pay, :And our geese are > all swans, as some witty folk say.Durack, M., quoting Moore in 'The > Governor's Ball', in Bennett, B., & Grono, W., Wide Domain: Western > Australian themes and images, Angus & Robertson, Sydney 1979: 47 The final line recalls an old English saying: \\"All his swans are turned to geese\\", meaning all his expectations end in nothing; all his boasting ends in smoke, like a person who fancies he sees a swan on a river but finds it to be only a goose. The phrase is sometimes reversed (as Moore has done): \\"All his geese are swans\\", which was commonly applied to people who think too much of the beauty and talent of their children and derived from Aesop's fable \\"The Eagle and the Owl\\".Brewer, E. Cobham, Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, 1898. http://www.bartleby.com/81/7059.html In Gaito Gazdanov's short story Black Swans (1930) the protagonist commits suicide because he has no opportunity of moving to Australia, which he imagines to be an idealised paradise of graceful black swans. D. H. Lawrence wrote in the 1925 short story \\"The Heritage\\": > :Jack looked out at the road, but was much more enchanted by the full, soft > river of heavenly blue water, on whose surface he looked eagerly for the > black swans. He didn't see any. :\\"Oh yes! Oh, yes! You'll find em wild in > their native state a little way up,\\" said Mr Swallow.Lawrence, D. H., 'The > Heritage', in Bennet and Grono, Wide Domain: Western Australian themes and > images: 63 Mollie Skinner, Lawrence's co-author of The Boy in the Bush also wrote the novel Black Swans, published in 1925 by Jonathan Cape in London. She uses Juvenal's phrase \\"rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno\\" (\\"a rare bird in the lands, and very like a black swan\\") as its subtitle. It alludes to her heroine, Letty Granville. The potency of the image of the black swan as a signifier of Westralian nationalism can be seen in this passage from Randolph Stow's \\"The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea\\", published in 1965: > :Perth was ancient ... And it was a very special city, cut off from other > cities by sea and desert, so that there was not another city for two > thousand miles. Among all Australian cities it had proved itself the most > special, by a romantic act called the Secession, which the other cities had > stuffily ignored. :Cinderella State, he thought, feeling indignant. That was > the reason for the Secession. Because they had ignored his poor Cinderella > State, all one million square miles of it. :Maybe after this war there'd be > another war. Western Australia against the world, Black Swan flying. :'We > shouldn't have gone to Parliament House,' his mother had remarked, 'it seems > to have made you political.' ... :'When will Western Australia be free?' he > wondered. :'I don't know,' said his mother. 'Perhaps when Bonnie Prince > Charlie comes over.' :'Aww.' He grew disgusted at her flippancy.Stow, R., > The Merry-go-Round in the Sea, Penguin Books, Ringwood 1985: 135 = Place names =  Aboriginal languages  The black swan is likely to be well represented in the toponymy of the south-west. (Toponymy is the scientific study of place names.) One example is Kurrabup (Nyungar language), or \\"black swan place\\", being the local Aboriginal name for the Wilson Inlet upon which the town of Denmark is situated in the South West.Songs of the West  English language  The English-language place name \\"Black Swan\\" only occurs as a descriptive toponym once: the Black Swan Mine in the arid interior of the state near Laverton.Map Names of the State's interior, however see the naming of the Swan River in 1780 as the Black Swan River in The more generic toponym \\"Swan\\", invariably referring to black swans, has at least 34 examples in Western Australia, almost entirely in the state's south-west.Map Names of the State's south-west These range from rural locations, such as Jebarjup Swan Lake in the Great Southern region, to the iconic Swan River. The Swan River is the source of at least eight shift names, forming the largest swan place-name cluster in Australia: Upper Swan, Middle Swan, Swan Valley, Swan View, West Swan, Swan Estuary, Swan District, and the City (formerly Shire) of Swan.Map Names of the State (Swan River region) The Swan Land District is the major cadastral unit of the state, underlying much of the name cluster. There are at least twenty \\"Swan\\" street names in the Perth metropolitan area.Streetsmart Perth 1993 Street Directory, Dept of Land Administration, Perth 1993 There are no \\"White Swan\\" toponyms in the state, and the toponymist Reed lists only the Swan River as a \\"Swan\\" toponym in the state.Reed, A.W., Place Names of Australia, Reed Books Pty Ltd., Frenchs Forest 1973: 203‚Äì204 The rarer form of Cygnet (\\"young swan\\") only occurs in three places, all along the Kimberley coast, where they commemorate the passage of William Dampier and the mutineers on the Cygnet in 1688.Reed, Place Names of Australia: 76 = Shipwrecks = With one-third of Australia's continental coastline within Western Australia, the cultural associations reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named \\"Black Swan\\" is surprisingly small. A lone cutter was wrecked in May 1851 in the Peel-Harvey Estuary near Mandurah. The large estuaries of the south-west of the state are strongly associated with black swans. There are six records for the more generic shipwreck name \\"Swan\\" between 1869 and 1972 on the north- west and west coasts, three times more than any other state,National Shipwreck Database as well as the destroyer escort HMAS Swan, which was scuttled in Geographe Bay in 1997 as an artificial reef.  Eastern Australia  Drawing published in 1792. Entitled Black Swan, native name \\"Mulgo\\", it is attributed to the Port Jackson Painter. = Heraldry = The coat of arms of Canberra, granted in 1928, includes swans as supporters. One swan is the black Australian kind, and the other white (similar to a European mute swan), said to be symbolising the Aboriginal and European people of Australia. A different version of this appear in the flag of the Australian Capital Territory. No other state or territory arms in eastern Australia include a black swan. Some 77 municipalities across eastern Australia have received grants of arms from the Crown since 1908, but only four include a black swan: Lake Macquarie (1970, supporter) and Queanbeyan (1980, supporter) in New South Wales, and Springvale (1976, supporter) and Sale (1985, supporters) in Victoria. These all indicate the presence of black swans in the municipal area. Campbelltown, New South Wales, has a white swan in the crest of its arms (1969), alluding to the arms of its namesake Campbell family. There are three grants of arms to corporations that include a black swan. In 1931, the Bank of New South Wales (now Westpac) was granted arms with a black swan supporter alluding to the Bank's acquisition of the Western Australian Bank in 1927.Low, C., A Roll of Australian arms: corporate and personal, borne by lawful authority, Rigby, Sydney 1971: 11 In the same year, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons was granted arms with a black swan in the first and fourth quarters, apparently derived from the Australian Arms.Low, A Roll of Australian arms: 6 In 1965, the Australian Academy of Science was granted arms with a black swan as a crest, alluding to the Academy's \\"Australianness\\" and its location in Canberra.Low, A Roll of Australian arms: 5 The black swan has not been used in the arms of any university or residential college in eastern Australia. Two religious authorities in eastern Victoria, the Anglican Diocese of Gippsland and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sale, have a black swan as a charge on their diocesan arms. = Philately = The transfer of postage-stamp production from the states to the Commonwealth in 1913 has resulted in four issues being produced featuring a black swan design, three commemorating a Western Australian anniversary. In 1929, a stamp designed by Perth architect George Pitt Morrison, featuring a black swan taken from one of the colonial stamp designs, marked the state's centenary. In 1954, the centenary of the first Western Australian stamp was marked by a commemorative issue in a similar style to the original one-penny Black Swan. In 1979, the state's 150th anniversary was marked with an issue featuring the anniversary logo, a stylised black swan. A 1991 series of waterbirds included a 43-cent stamp showing a pair of black swans nesting with cygnets. This is the only philatelic recognition of the black swan's cultural values in eastern Australia as an emblem of estuarine and riverine environments characteristic of south-eastern Australia. Incidental philatelic illustrations of the black swan include the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games (held in Perth) stamp issue bearing the Arms of the City of Perth with black swan supporters and charge, a 1963 commemorative of Canberra's founding featuring the city's arms, with black swan supporter, and the 1990 series of rare colonial stamps that included a reproduction of the colonial 4d Blue Inverted Swan. The black swan appears in stamp issues illustrating the Australian Arms (as one of the charges on the shield) in 1948, 1951, 1975 and 1999; and in a 1981 Queen's Birthday commemorative illustrating Her Majesty's personal flag (which is banner of the shield in the Australian Arms).Eastick, M., Comprehensive Colour Catalogue of Australian Stamps, Victoria Stamp Traders, Malvern 2003: 11‚Äì183 = Decorative arts = Images of the black swan played only a minor role in the development of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, flannel flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain.'Detail of Public Park Fountain', in Stephen, Ann (Ed), Visions of a Republic: the work of Lucien Henry, Paris, Noumea, Sydney, Powerhouse Publishing, Sydney 2001: 220‚Äì221 A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.Fraser, H., and Joyce., R., The Federation House: Australia‚Äôs own style, Lansdowne, The Rocks 1986 In 1913, the sculptor William Priestly MacIntosh carved a \\"coat of arms\\" for each state on the pilaster capitals of the fa√ßade of the new Commonwealth Bank headquarters on Pitt Street, Sydney.Earnshaw, Beverley, An Australian sculptor : William Priestly Macintosh, Kogarah Historical Society, Kogarah 2004 He included a black swan on a shield for Western Australia, 56 years before the state was granted a coat of arms of a similar design. The Sydney Hospital fountain and the Commonwealth Bank fa√ßade are two uncommon examples of the use of the black swan in decorative arts in eastern Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. = Literature = Black Swan occurs rarely in literary titles. The State Library of New South Wales catalogue lists only ten fiction titles, one of which is an English-language translation of Thomas Mann's 1954 work The Black Swan (Die Betrogene in GermanDie Betrogene (in the German wikipedia)). Humphrey McQueen's book, The Black Swans of Trespass: The Emergence of Modernist Painting in Australia 1918‚Äì1944, takes its title from the final line of the poem \\"Durer: Innsbruck, 1495\\": > :In its ignorance the vision of others. I am still :The black swan of > trespass on alien waters. This poem, the first by Ern Malley to be published in Angry Penguins (1943), became a celebrated literary event.McQueen, H., The Black Swans of Trespass: The Emergence of Modernist Painting in Australia 1918‚Äì1944, Alternative Publishing, Sydney 1979 = Place names =  Aboriginal languages  The black swan is represented in the toponymy of eastern Australia. Several anglicised versions of local Aboriginal-language place names referring to black swans are known. Examples include Dunedoo (Wiradjuri language) on the Talbragar River,Reed, Place Names of Australia: 86 Berrima (Tharawal or Gundungurra language) in the Southern Highlands,Station names ‚Äì New South Wales Rail and Mulgoa (Gundungurra language) on the Nepean River,Penrith, New South Wales all in New South Wales; and Maroochydore on Queensland's Sunshine Coast (Yuggera language: Muru-kutchi ‚Äì meaning \\"red bill\\", the name of the black swan). Maroochydore is from Murukutchi-dha, the place of the black swan. This name was given by Andrew Petrie in 1842, who had two Brisbane River (Yuggera) Aboriginal men with him from whom he presumably heard the words. The local name for the swan is Kuluin. Barwon Heads, Victoria, is near Lake Connewarre, through which the Barwon River flows on its way to the sea. The name Connewarre is the local aboriginal name for the black swan, which was found in large numbers on the lake.Baron Heads, Victoria There are also instances of such names being newly applied today; for example, Hydro Tasmania has adopted Aboriginal names for some parts of its hydro-electric developments, such as Catagunya, meaning black swan.Hydro-Electric development, Tasmania  English language  The English-language place name \\"Black Swan\\" occurs as a descriptive toponym in four states, usually as a \\"name cluster\\". Queensland has a Black Swan Creek near Gladstone, together with nearby Black Swan Island and a Black Swan Rock further south near Shoalwater Bay; another Black Swan Creek near Maryborough; and a Black Swan Lagoon inland on the Darling Downs near Warwick. New South Wales has a Black Swan Anabranch adjoining a Black Swan Lagoon on the north side of the Murray River in the Corowa Shire. In South Australia's arid north, there is a Black Swan Swamp just north of Roxby Downs and a Black Swan Waterhole further north of the old Overland Telegraph line. Tasmania has a Black Swan Island near the wild South West Cape. Given the broad sweep of the black swan's natural habitat, the presence of only nine distinctive place names or name clusters within that range indicates the rarity of \\"Black Swan\\" as a toponym. New Zealand also has a Black Swan Stream in the South Auckland district. The more generic toponym \\"Swan\\" invariably refers to black swans. The Gazetteer of AustraliaMap names of New South Wales lists 57 examples in New South Wales, 32 in Tasmania, 20 in Queensland, 19 in Victoria, 10 in South Australia, 5 in the Northern Territory, and none in the other territories. Some idiosyncratic examples are Swan Hole (NSW), Swan Spit (Vic) and Swan Nook (Tas). The Gazetter also lists two \\"White Swan\\" toponyms: a mine and reservoir near St Arnaud, on the Victorian goldfields. A clear concentration is evident in New South Wales and Tasmania. By contrast, the toponymist Reed lists only three examples: Swan Hill and Swan Pond in Victoria, and Swan Point in Tasmania (all named by explorers after sighting black swans in large numbers).Reed, Place Names of Australia: 203‚Äì204 In Sydney, there are thirteen \\"Swan\\" street names and one \\"Black Swan\\" street name,2003 Sydney & Blue Mountains Street Directory, 39th edition, UBD, Macquarie Park 2003 in contrast to a lone \\"Swan\\" street name in Darwin.Darwin, includes Katherine & Nhulunbuy, 2004/2005 Phone Directory & Street Directory, PDC Directories, Darwin 2004 The rarer form of Cygnet (\\"young swan\\") occasionally occurs. The Gazetteer of Australia records eleven in Tasmania (the densest concentration), five in South Australia and one in Victoria, but Reed's only example is Cygnet, Tasmania, anglicised from Port des Cygnes, so-named by the French explorer Bruni d'Entrecasteaux in 1793 because of the large number of swans he observed there. = Shipwrecks = Another cultural association is reflected in the scattering of shipwrecks named \\"Black Swan\\". Tasmania has a wrecked schooner (1830) off Prime Seal Island in the Bass Strait and a wrecked fishing boat (1950) off Swansea on the east coast. New South Wales has two wrecks off its northern coast: a cutter near Newcastle (1852) and a paddle steamer (1868) near the Manning River. The name \\"Black Swan\\" probably refers to the aquatic characteristics of black swans such as buoyancy and a graceful style, even though the shipwreck record suggests the hope in the name association was not always well founded. There are five records for the more generic \\"Swan\\" between 1836 and 1934: one in Tasmania, and two each in Victoria and New South Wales, including torpedo-boat destroyer HMAS Swan, scuttled in 1934.  Sport  = Australian rules football = State of Origin guernsey In Australian rules football, the symbol of the black swan has been used prominently by the West Australian interstate teams since the state debuted in 1904. The black swan symbol has featured in the State of Origin series between 1977‚Äì1998 on the various guernsey designs (with some variations contrasting the swan depicted in the colours of the state emblem in reverse ‚Äì as yellow on a black background and others with a yellow outline).Western Australian Jumpers Retrieved 10 February 2007. The 1978 variation of the WA jumper was used one-off by the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League Heritage Round in July 2007.Heritage guernseys up for auction 5 July 2007. The names of two Australian rules football clubs illustrate a contemporary variation of the ways in which cultural references to the black swan have changed and been transformed over time. The Swan Districts Football Club was established in 1932 at Bassendean, near the industrial and railway hub of the Swan District and a large community of expatriate Victorians. The name associated the club with the place, as did its emblem of a black swan. The club has since played in the West Australian Football League. The South Melbourne Football Club was established in 1874 and was one of the founding clubs in the VFL/AFL. During the 1920s and 1930s, an influx of players from Western Australia led to the team becoming known as the \\"swans\\" within the VFL.Sydney Swans ‚Äì A Brief History Retrieved 10 February 2007. In 1982, South Melbourne transferred to Sydney, dropping its old place name but retaining its nickname as the Sydney Swans. The swan, however, is no longer a black swan but a white swan, derived from existing red and white colours of South Melbourne and the lake-bound white swans of Albert Park near its original home ground. The white swan is often combined with, or replaced by, a white Sydney Opera House-style logo. This is an apparently rare example of Western Australian swan symbolism being transferred eastward, then transformed to symbolise something else, retaining only an echo of its formerly symbolic values. None of the current AFL teams have taken a black swan emblem in allusion to any natural qualities of the bird, and its sole representation in the symbology of the league refers to the largely unresearched phenomenon of late 19th-mid 20th century migration between Western Australia and Victoria ‚Äì now borne by a club that has emigrated to New South Wales. It is an ironic transformation in the symbolism of a bird that was for so long thought to be non-migratory. = America's Cup = The tender to Australia II, the yacht that won the 1983 America's Cup at Newport, Rhode Island, was called Black Swan.  Music  Gian Carlo Menotti, in his opera The Medium, named one of his most famous arias \\"The Black Swan\\", which is a \\"dark lullaby\\" sung by the character Monica. BTS released the single \\"Black Swan\\" ahead of their 2020 album Map of the Soul: 7. Its lyrics refer to an artist's fear of losing passion in their art and was praised by critics. Perth rock group The Triffids released an album called The Black Swan in 1989. The American thrash metal band Megadeth released a song entitled \\"Black Swan\\" as a bonus track on their 2007 album United Abominations. This song was later re- recorded and re-released on their 2011 album Thirteen. Singer/songwriter Tori Amos released a song entitled \\"Black Swan\\" as a bonus track on her 1994 UK CD single \\"Pretty Good Year\\". Singer Thom Yorke of the band Radiohead released a song entitled \\"Black Swan\\" on the soundtrack of the 2006 film A Scanner Darkly and, three days later, on his debut solo album, The Eraser. The American alternative-rock band Chiodos released a song entitled \\"Lexington\\", which references black swans in the lyric, \\"All the water in the ocean couldn't turn this swan's legs from black to white.\\" The American avant-garde band The Blood Brothers released a song entitled \\"Giant Swan\\", in which a giant swan is used as a metaphor for society and war, until it is renamed in the lyric, \\"It's gonna sting like a raw sunrise when the Black Swan's gone.\\" Finnish power metal band Sonata Arctica included a song entitled \\"Fly With the Black Swan\\" on their 2007 album Unia. American band Story of the Year released an album entitled The Black Swan in 2008. The American ambient band Amber Asylum released a song entitled \\"Black Swan\\" on their 2000 album The Supernatural Parlour Collection. The German death metal/gothic rock band Lacrimas Profundere released a song entitled \\"Black Swans\\" on their 1999 album Memorandum. The Japanese noise artist Merzbow titled the eighth volume of his 2009‚Äì2010 box set 13 Japanese Birds Black Swan.  Modern philosophy  John Stuart Mill in the chapter \\"Of The Ground of Induction\\" in his A System of Logic (1843) cited the example of \\"all swans are white\\" as a case of incorrect induction based on genuine experiences with erroneous conclusions. \\"As there were black swans, though civilized people had existed for three thousand years on the earth without meeting with them...The uniform experience, therefore, of the inhabitants of the known world, agreeing in a common result, without one known instance of deviation from that result, is not always sufficient to establish a general conclusion.\\" Bertrand Russell cited the case of the 'black swan' in his chapter \\"On Induction\\" in his 1912 publication The Problems of Philosophy. Karl Popper used the black swan example in his argument on falsifiability in The Logic of Scientific Discovery invoking David Hume. Logik der Forschung 1934 The Problem of Induction The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable is the title of an influential 2007 book by Lebanese thinker Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The book expounds Taleb's theory that rare, unexpected, highly anomalous events are both more common and more momentous than previously imagined. This theory has since become known as the black swan theory.

He is noted for establishing the Dallas Symphony Orchestra in 1900 and for serving as its first music director.  Career  Hans Kreissig was born in Germany, the son of Gustav and Marie Kreissig. His early musical training was in Germany; this was followed by several years studying composition and conducting with Arthur Sullivan in London. Early in his career he was the accompanist for Jules Levy, a noted English cornet player. Kreissig first came to the United States in 1883, with a touring opera company, and in 1884 he settled in Dallas, Texas. There he taught piano and organ, and also directed choirs at several churches and synagogues. By 1886, he had been appointed conductor of the Dallas Frohsinn, a male chorus; he held that position until 1912. The Frohsinn was a prominent part of Dallas's musical life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: it was featured in local presentations of opera and symphonic music as well as its own concerts, and it made several performance tours throughout Texas. In addition to the Frohsinn, Kreissig organized and conducted a number of band and orchestra concerts in the 1880s and 1890s, and he later founded the Beethoven Trio and the Phoenix Club (a chamber ensemble). Kreissig's promotion of the arts in Dallas also included fundraising, which he did on foot among the city's merchants. In 1900, Kreissig formed the original Dallas Symphony Orchestra, which presented its first concert in May of that year. He conducted one more concert, in 1901, after which the orchestra suspended operations. Although the DSO has since evolved in numerous fundamental ways, including temporary name changes and several multiyear periods of dormancy, the present organization still traces its origins to Kreissig's 1900 ensemble, as it is stated in the notes accompanying DSO 100, a commemorative CD issued by the Dallas Symphony in 2000. Following Kreissig's 1912 retirement from the leadership of the Frohsinn, he taught piano privately in Dallas until his death in 1929.  Personal life  Kreissig married Louise Cretien, a native of the Texas French settlement La Reunion, in 1893. They had one son, Alfred Kreissig, and a daughter, Daisy Kreissig Jacoby.

History  It is one of the oldest villages in Cieszyn Silesia. It was first mentioned in the document of Pope Gregory IX issued in 1229 among villages belonging to Benedictine abbey in Tyniec, as Wierzbica. In 1268 it was bestowed (without an inn) by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolski to the newly established Benedictine abbey in Orlov√°. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz and Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

He was recaptured almost immediately. Biography Scott was born in Springfield, Kentucky. He was convicted of bank robbery and the possession of unregistered firearms in Lexington, Kentucky, and sentenced to thirty years in prison. John Paul Scott, Federal Prison Record, 1959 Alcatraz He was sent to Alcatraz Island in 1949 and given prisoner number #AZ 1403. On the evening of December 16, 1962, the 35-year-old tried to escape from the island, together with 31-year-old Darl Lee Parker (inmate #1413-AZ), a convicted bank robber and hijacker (sentenced to 50 years). While working on culinary duty, in a storage room below the kitchen, the two bent the bars of a window in the latrine of the cell block, climbed down a rope, and made it to the water. They then attempted to float to the San Francisco shore, a distance of 1.4 miles. For that purpose, they made water wings from stolen rubber gloves which they blew up. The escape was noticed at 5:47 a.m. Parker had to give up after a short time because he had broken his ankle during the escape. He was recaptured twenty minutes after the escape was discovered, on the rock formation Little Alcatraz, which lies 100 yards from Alcatraz Island. Although the Coast Guard was searching the bay, they failed to find Scott. At 7:40 a.m., the Presidio Military Police got a call from one of four teenagers who had found an unconscious man at Fort Point beneath the Golden Gate Bridge. That man proved to be John Paul Scott, suffering from hypothermia and exhaustion. Apparently he had been carried by the ebbing tide to this location, approximately 3 miles from Alcatraz. After recovering in the Letterman General Hospital, he was immediately returned to Alcatraz. It had seemed impossible to escape from Alcatraz by swimming. The seasonal water temperature in the Bay is about 53 ¬∞F (12 ¬∞C) in December and the current can exceed 6 knots. Citing these facts, as well as occasional visits from Great White Sharks and razor-sharp rocks, prison officers had discouraged most escape attempts. When Frank Morris and brothers John and Clarence Anglin had escaped and disappeared half a year earlier, prison officials had said that they had likely drowned (although the FBI just listed them as missing). Scott's escape shook this line of reasoning. For the first time it was proved that a prisoner could escape (if only temporarily) by swimming. =Later life= After the closing of Alcatraz, Scott was first transferred to Leavenworth and later to a prison in Marion, Illinois, where he made another escape attempt. From there he spent several years at the Oak Park Heights prison in Minnesota. He died in 1987 in the Federal Correctional Institution, Tallahassee, Florida.

Founded in 2002 by Michael Cooper, son of John Cooper, the racing car maker and tuner responsible for the original Mini Cooper. In 2007, German automaker BMW acquired the rights to the name and bought out the company in 2008. JCW Tuning =Cooper= The first ever JCW kit was a upgrade for the Mini Cooper. The kit consisted of the following components: *Flowed and ported cylinder head *Air filter *Cover injection tube *Uprated exhaust (from the catalytic converter back) *Remapped ECU *Decorative emblems Despite its price tag of over ‚Ç¨2000, this kit only offered a power increase of , a sportier exhaust note and a crisper throttle response. The main advantage was that these improvements, though fairly minor, could be made to the Cooper without jeopardizing the factory warranty. In 2004, JCW discontinued the Cooper kit and introduced a Sound Kit for the Cooper. The Sound Kit consisted of a unique air intake system, cat-back exhaust and an ECU remap. =Cooper S R52 and R53= The first JCW Tuning Kit to be made available for the Cooper S was an upgrade for the Cooper S, producing a total of . Released in 2002, the kit consisted of the following components:http://www.motoringfile.com/howto/JCW_MCS_install.pdf * Uprated cylinder head, gas-flowed and ported * 11% Reduction of the supercharger pulley size, making the same supercharger spin faster for a particular engine speed * 1-step colder, Colder Temperature Range spark plugs * Uprated exhaust system (maintaining the same header and catalytic converter) * Remapped ECU * Decorative badges, individually numbered engine plate and certificate signed by Mike Cooper At the time, the kit could not be factory-ordered, but had to be retrofitted at a Mini dealer, but from late 2005 the Cooper S could be ordered with the upgrade straight from factory. In 2005, an additional upgrade was launched that increased power further to , with the following components:http://www.outmotoring.com/images/how_to/MIN_JCWUPGRADE_gen1.pdf * Uprated injectors (380cc/min instead of 330 cc/min) * Remapped ECU for the injectors * Uprated air intake system and air filter A \\"JCW Sound Kit\\" was made available at the same time, consisting of the cat-back exhaust and the air filter, giving a sportier exhaust note and a power increase for around ‚Ç¨1100. =Cooper S R55, R56 and R57= In 2007, Mini released the JCW tuning kit for the new \\"R56\\" version of the car. This new version now being turbocharged as opposed to supercharged, the kit itself is very different from that of the previous Cooper S. Consisting of an uprated induction system, exhaust and ECU remap, this kit raises power to . The torque figure climbs 10 Nm to 250 Nm (270 Nm with overboost). Acceleration from 0‚Äì100 km/h (0-62 mph) is now 6.8 seconds, and a top speed of 232 km/h (144 mph) is now possible. This kit is commonly referred to as the \\"Stage 1 Kit\\", although this nomenclature has never been officially employed by JCW or by BMW. According to Mike Cooper, this kit would create \\"the fastest Mini ever produced\\"http://www.motoringfile.com/2007/07/31/r56-jcw-kit-stage-1-parts- list/ R56 JCW Kit above all due to the extra torque and in-gear acceleration, which in certain driving situations will be even faster than the Mini JCW GP. In 2011, the JCW tuning kit was updated for the Cooper S LCI (135 kW). The kit consists of an uprated exhaust (cat-back), intake system, exhaust manifold and an ECU remap. The tuning kit includes a small plaque with a unique serial number mounted on the engine, as well as front and rear JCW emblems. The power is increased 12 kW from the standard 135 kW to 147 kW. =Factory John Cooper Works R56= In mid-2008, Mini brought out a new addition to the JCW family - the Mini John Cooper Works. This is in fact not another power kit, but a whole new version of the R56 Mini Hatch, model code MF91 (MM91 in the Clubman version). This new version comes with major differences from the factory, compared to the power kit that can be supplied through the dealer network: *Maximum power of 155 kW (208 bhp) at 6000 rpm, and 260 Nm of torque (280 with overboost). This is achieved by means of a new, uprated turbocharger, larger- bore exhaust and a sportier ECU map. 0‚Äì100 km/h time is down to 6.3 seconds (6.6 in the case of the Clubman). Fuel consumption and emissions are also up, however, compared to the kit which has no change compared to the standard Cooper S. *Electronic limited slip differential (EDLC - Electronic Differential Lock Control). This is infinitely variable between 0% and 50%, as opposed to the permanent 30% of the optional LSD fitted to the R56 MINI Cooper S. *DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) as fitted as standard on all current BMW models. The John Cooper Works is the first variant of the Mini to come with DTC which, to date, is not available even as an option on other variants. The main difference between DTC and the existent DSC is the ability to \\"remap\\" the parameters for the traction and stability control systems, to allow a sportier drive while still employing these systems at the last minute, without fully deactivating them. *Brembo 4 pot caliper JCW brakes, consisting of: four- piston aluminium fixed front brake calipers finished in red with John Cooper Works logo, red painted single piston rear calipers, perforated and grooved ventilated front brake discs (316x22mm or 12.44x0.87in), rear brake discs (280x10mm or 11x0.39in) =2013 Factory John Cooper Works GP= Commonly referred to as the GP2, the 2013 John Cooper Works GP is a limited-edition, track-oriented version of the regular John Cooper Works hatchback based loosely on the JCW Challenge race car. Production was limited to 2000 units worldwide. The GP2 boasts a 218-hp (214 for US models) turbo-charged 1.6 L direct-injected four cylinder engine, giving it a 0‚Äì60 mph time of 6.1 seconds and a top speed of 150 mph. The engine is essentially identical to the N18 used in other 2013 John Cooper Works models, with a slight increase in compression accounting for the modest power gain. In keeping with its uncompromising roots, a 6-speed manual gearbox was the only transmission offered. The GP2 also features exclusive 17‚Äù wheels, high-performance tires designed in a special partnership with Kumho, adjustable coil over suspension with revised geometry unique to the GP, 6-piston Brembo¬Æ front calipers borrowed from the BMW 135i, a full valance tray and functional rear diffuser, a hatch-mounted spoiler with carbon fiber element, red mirror caps, brake ducts, signature badging, a pair of special-edition RECARO sport seats (complete with side-impact airbags), and deletion of the rear seats to save weight. The stability control suite features an additional \\"GP mode\\" exclusive to this model which permits a greater degree of wheel-slip while retaining function of the brake-based electronic limited slip differential. The 500 examples sold in the US originally retailed for $39,950 and were available in only one configuration. Notable racing history: *MINI has confirmed it lapped the N√ºrburgring-Nordschleife track in 8 minutes and 23 seconds - an improvement over the previous GP model by 19 seconds. *John Hume Sr won the 2014 Targa Newfoundland Grand Touring division in a GP2, and again in 2017. =2015 Factory John Cooper Works= MotorPress.ca reviewed the F56 JCW and gave it a rating of 8.3 out of 10, praising its driving characteristics and mighty engine. =Countryman= The John Cooper Works Countryman is the first 5-door JCW from Mini that unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show.

The renaming in July 1863 as Dover Priory led rival SER to adopt the name \\"Dover Town\\" for one of its Dover stations. Dover Priory is the only station still open in Dover.  Former stations  Besides Dover Priory, there have been five other stations in Dover, all of which are now closed. = Dover Harbour = Goods train from Eastern Dock running along Marine Parade in 1956 The name Dover Harbour has been used for two separate stations. The first was opened by the LCDR on 1 November 1861; this was closed in June 1863 when it was replaced by a new station named Dover Town and Harbour. This was renamed Dover Harbour on 1 July 1899 and closed on 10 July 1927. The LCDR constructed a tunnel through the Western Heights to allow continental traffic to access the Western Docks in 1861, and just south of the tunnel, on the current track to Folkestone, a station was built. Later an extension was also built onto Admiralty Pier. It was closed in 1927 by Southern as part of their rationalisation and modernisation of the Dover area. Although the platforms have been demolished as in March 2017 the station buildings still survive as offices. = Dover Town = The SER's original station opened on 7 February 1844 as Dover, and was situated on Shakespeare Beach just east of where the current line from Folkestone turns north towards Dover Priory. This was originally a terminus, but later the line continued onto Admiralty Pier. It was renamed Dover Town in December 1861, and was closed on 14 October 1914 as part of rationalisation and modernisation of the Dover area by SECR. After closure for passengers the track/platforms were in use for freight/engineers use until the 1990s. After the track was removed the area was used for car parking and in March 2017 some sections of platforms still survive. = Admiralty Pier = In 1860 SER started running trains on to the pier, the LCDR following in 1864. This exposed halt was extended and replaced by Dover Marine in 1909. The SER station at Dover Admiralty Pier opened on 30 August 1864 and closed in August 1914. =Dover Prince of Wales Pier= This station was opened in 1902 and closed in 1909. Dover Western Docks railway station in 2007 Dover Marine station, 1990 = Dover Marine/Dover Western Docks = Situated on Admiralty Pier for connection to ships, this was constructed on an expanded pier by SECR, finished in 1914, began to be used on 2 February 1915 but was not available for public use until 18 January 1919; in the meantime it had been renamed Dover Marine on 5 December 1918. It was a large terminus with four platforms covered by a full roof. Platforms were extended to take 12-car trains in February 1959.Railway Magazine March 1959 p. 211 It was renamed again to Dover Western Docks on 14 May 1979, and was closed by British Rail on 26 September 1994 with the demise of boat trains and the opening of the Channel Tunnel. It is now a cruise liner terminal. Regie voor Maritiem Transport used to run ferries until 1994 from here to Oostende railway station which connected into Belgian railway line 50A run by NMBS. There was a fast ferry service using the Jetfoil as well as conventional ferries. The Southern Railway opened a large locomotive depot at the site in 1928.

It was the ruling party from 1954 until 1958. The party supported the government of President Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes (1958-1963).Ameringer, Charles D.

Although they were not successful in the presidential election of 1964 their candidate in 1970, Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio, was elected President, in coalition with the Institutional Democratic Party. Victory was also secured in the 1974 election when Kjell Eugenio Laugerud Garc√≠a's candidacy was also endorsed by the PID.

Another faction of the party, the National Reformist Movement, split away after the coup although it never became a major factor in electoral politics. In the 1982 election, the MLN's candidate was former vice- president Mario Sandoval Alarc√≥n, who placed second in what was considered a fraudulent election, followed by a coup d'√©tat in 1982. For the 1984 elections to the Constitutional Assembly, the party allied with National Authentic Central, another right-wing party, and the 23 seats they won constituted the largest bloc in the assembly, albeit outnumbered by reformist parties. They renewed their alliance with the Institutional Democratic Party for the 1985 election. Once more, Mario Sandoval Alarc√≥n was its presidential candidate, and placed fourth in the race while the alliance won 12 seats in Congress. The party faded thereafter: it ran alongside the National Advancement Front in 1990 without much success, winning just 4 seats in Congress.

The group operated after the withdrawal of the Greek forces from the area (April 1941), against the invading Italians, Germans and both against the Albanian communist and collaborationist organizations. History In May 1942, the first Northern Epirote resistance groups appeared in the area of Delvina led by two locals and former officers of the Greek army: Spyridon Lytos and Ioannis Videlis. Soon several resistance groups were formed by the local Greek population all over southern Albania. They were operating in the regions: Pogon, Lunxh√´ri, Zagorie, Riza, Himara, Vlor√´, P√´rmet, Leskovik and Korce. In June 1942 these groups were organized under one leadership and the MAVI (also called EAOVI) was formed. The leading spirit was Vasilios Sahinis, a native from Douvian (Dropull).Ruches 1965: 156 The organization was a branch of the right-wing EDES that operated in Greece and its headquarters moved from place to place in southern Albania. =Italian occupation= Widespread action was taken by the Northern Epirote resistance in December 1942, when attacks on Italian controlled frontier posts and gendarmerie stations increased. In the regions of Zagorie, Pogon, Delvine, Sarande (Vourkos) and Rhize sectors guerilla activity by MAVI was increasing.

Epirote groups were able to take the initiative for a short-time period. During the period before Italy's surrender until the communist party prevailed (1943‚Äì1944) vicious fighting occurred between MAVI and combined armed groups of Germans and Albanian nationalists of Balli Komb√´tar (Ballists)Ruches 1965: 161 \\"The Ballist campaign of extermination...\\", 162 \\"fierce battles took place between Northern Epirotes and a mixed force of Balli chetas, Albanian fascist militia units and Germans.James Petiffer.

A group calling itself the \\"Northern Epirus Liberation Front\\" (MAVI) claimed responsibility for the incident. It accused the Albanian Government of violating the rights of the ethnic Greek minority in Albania and berated Athens for not doing enough to support the minority. MAVI also issued a pamphlet last fall announcing the commencement of an \\"armed struggle\\" against Tirana and demanding, inter alia, the cessation of the alleged \\"colonization\\" of \\"Northern Epirus\\" -- the Greek name for southern Albania, which has a large ethnic Greek population -- by Albanians from the north. MAVI was the name of an ethnic Greek resistance group in Albania during World War II that operated first against the invading Italians and then against the Communists. Press reports state that the group was disbanded in the 1940s, although responsibility for the 1984 bombing of the Albanian Embassy in Athens was claimed in its name. responsibility was claimed by a far-right paramilitary organization which had the same name. However, there is no clear link between the two organizations. According to press reports the World War II resistance organization, probably disbanded during the 1940s.https://fas.org/irp/threat/terror_94/euro.html#Albania ...press reports state that the group probably disbanded during the 1940s.

Chouteau was born in St. Louis, then part of Spanish colonial Upper Louisiana. His father was Jean Pierre Chouteau, one of the first settlers in St. Louis. His mother was Pelagie Kiersereau (1767-1793) One of his brothers was Pierre Chouteau, Jr. (who founded Fort Pierre in South Dakota). A half-brother (born after his father married Brigitte Saucier) was Fran√ßois Chouteau, who established a trading post and was one of the first settlers of Kansas City, Missouri. Auguste Chouteau was among the first young men from Missouri to be appointed to West Point by Thomas Jefferson. After graduating in 1806, he resigned the Army in 1807. He entered the family fur trading business, but he later served as captain of the territorial militia during the War of 1812. After the war, Chouteau was arrested in 1817 by the Spanish during a trading expedition on the upper Arkansas River, as they considered that area under their control and excluded others from its lucrative trading. He was imprisoned in Santa Fe, New Mexico. After being released, Chouteau continued the family trade among the Osage. He established his home in present-day Salina, Oklahoma, part of the western extent of their territory. In 1832, Washington Irving visited the post and described it in Tour of the Prairies. Choteau had children by at least four women who were at least partly Osage, fathering at least seven children by these women. He also married Sophie Labbadie, a cousin of French descent, whom he kept in St. Louis while he kept the other women on the frontier. He had at least nine children with his wife Sophie Choteau. The two other women he was most closely associated with were Rosalie Lambert, who he had two children by, and her sister Masina Lambert, with whom he had three children. The Lamberts' mother was Osage and their father was a Metis.

Dudley. Parties and Politics in Northern Nigeria, Routledge, 1968. p 88-90. In 1951, he contested and won a seat to the House of Assembly defeating the Waziri Mohammed. A year later at the inception of the Northern People's Congress, which later became the dominant party in the region, he was nominated as the party's secretary- general; he joined a large number of his colleagues from the regional house who enlisted on the political platform of the new NPC. As the general secretary of NPC, he became one of the party's prominent campaigners and was involved in political tours, traveling for thousands of miles while providing support for the extension of the party through the establishment of branches in various towns and cities in the region.

Subsequent years were spent in alternate periods of operations that included school ship duties at Yorktown, amphibious exercises along the coast of North Carolina, and mine countermeasures operations along the Eastern seaboard. Redesignated coastal minesweeper MSC(O)-13 in February 1955, Grackle was placed in service in reserve 16 September 1957 and was decommissioned on 11 October 1957 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He was the founder of the Columbia School of Linguistics, which is named after Columbia University, where he received his Ph.D. in comparative Indo-European linguistics. Although his background lay mainly in the linguistics of ancient languages, his approach to linguistics was uniquely modern and scientific. His lectures were sprinkled with references to the history and the methodology of science. He believed that science is explanation, not description or prediction, and he compared the explanatory power of the Copernican astronomical system with the explanatory weakness of the epicycles of the Ptolemaic system, both of which had equal descriptive and predictive power. He also believed that the purpose of language was chiefly communication, and his linguistic analyses reflected that orientation, along with that of human psychology and physiology. In other words, those orientations helped him to explain why languages take the forms they do. During Diver‚Äôs career, most popular schools of linguistic thought tended towards pure formalism, based on traditional categories and entities, such as the parts of speech and the sentence. While this schools rejected prescriptivism and the idealization of the standard language, Diver stood almost alone in rejecting traditional entities that had no specific function, such as the syllable and the mechanistic interpretation of \\"government\\" or \\"agreement.\\" He analyzed language as a form of human behavior, rather than as an idealized expression of truth. The article on the Columbia School of Linguistics has more details and successful application of Diver's methodology.  Life  Born in Chicago, Diver received his BA degree from Lawrence College in 1942, his MA in English literature from Harvard and his PhD in comparative Indo-European linguistics at Columbia. He served in the US Navy during World War II and earned the Legion of Merit. He taught linguistics from 1955 to 1989 at Columbia University.

In 1899 Collcutt designed the Lloyd's Register of Shipping Building in London, extensively decorated with allegorical sculpture by George Frampton and a major landmark of the New Sculpture movement. For Richard D'Oyly Carte, Collcutt designed the Savoy Hotel, which has been subsequently altered, and the Palace Theatre, London (1889) in Cambridge Circus, Charing Cross Road, which was built as the Royal English Opera House. Sir Arthur Sullivan's grand opera, Ivanhoe, was the first production at the theatre. Collcutt also designed the Bechstein piano showrooms at 40 Wigmore Street (1889) and the Wigmore Hall (1901).

General Forrest's target was Columbus, an attack which didn't eventuate. The regiment remained there and performed garrison duty until September 26. While stationed at Columbus, information was received that General Forrest and his confederate troops, would attack Paducah, Kentucky, and the regiment was ordered to march out and intercept Forrest's troops. On August 12, the expedition marched to Mayfield, Kentucky, but learned the confederate troops had changed direction and captured Memphis, Tennessee. Returning to Columbus, the regiment reenlisted for a further fifteen days. The regiment was ordered from Columbus to Chicago, however, en route to Chicago, General Sterling Price's troops were in the process of raiding Missouri, and the 136th was ordered to Missouri. Having arrived at St. Louis, Missouri, and camped at Benton Barracks, the regiment was divided and companies sent to various forts throughout St. Louis, until October 15. From Missouri, the regiment moved to Camp Butler, Illinois, and on October 30 was mustered out. The 136th Regiment was never in a regular battle, though performed occasional raids against guerrillas.

The central point about Lycrophron as attacked in the Politics of Aristotle, is that Lycrophron rejected the idea that the state exists to make people \\"just and good\\", instead holding the view that justice and law is about preventing people violating the bodies and goods of each other. This is the only reference to Lycrophron in the Politics. The details of his life remain obscure, other than a number of references in the works of Aristotle. Lycophron was probably among the students of Gorgias, and is mentioned as a sophist by Aristotle.Quarles (2004), pp. 135‚Äì136 He rejected the supposed value of an aristocratic birth, claiming that meaning that there is no factual difference between those well- born and those low-born; only words and opinion assign value to these different circumstances of birth.Diels, Dent Sprague (2001), pp. 68‚Äì69 This statement may indicate that Lycophron shared the beliefs of Antiphon, that (regardless of their ancestry) both Greeks and barbarians are born with the same capacities: An egalitarian belief that was a minority view in the 5th century BC.quoted in Mario Untersteiner, The Sophists, tr. Kathleen Freeman (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954), p. 252 He is also known for his statement (reproduced by Aristotle, in the latter's Politics, 1280b10), that \\"law is only a convention, a surety to another of justice\\".Mulgan (1979), pp. 121‚Äì128 Also translated as \\"a guarantor of men's rights against one another\\". He thus believed that law is a matter of agreement, a social convention and not a natural or universal standard (there is no evidence that Lycophron rejected the idea that law is a universal standard - indeed his view appears far more universalist than that of Aristotle, in that Lycophron proposes a single standard, what would now be called the non aggression principle, in relation to all states). In this respect his views on law are similar to those of Protagoras.Quarles (2004), pp. 121‚Äì122 This means that he treats law as a mere means, in the context of a (perhaps primitive) social contract theory, without considering it as something special, in contradistinction to, e.g., Plato but similar to both Thrasymachus and Callicles, albeit that their theories have ‚Äì as far as can be ascertained from the information available about them ‚Äì more specific characteristics. While Lycophron is considered one of the first proponents of a social contract theory, this is mostly a conjecture based on his theory of law. His few surviving quotes do not include a theory on the emergence of society from agreements. Such ideas did exist, however, in the works of his contemporary Protagoras. These 5th-century BC ideas viewed society and morality as human creations, both aiming to protect the lives and safety of the community members. The laws were subject to change, reflecting the changing views of a society. There was no \\"unchanging standard of righteousness\\". In other words, Protagoras and like-minded thinkers were precursors of Utilitarianism.Quarles (2004), pp. 128‚Äì129 In Metaphysics, Lycophron is quoted as claiming that \\"knowledge is a communion of knowledge and of soul\\". And also that the communion is the cause of the unity of knowledge and the soul. In Physics, it is mentioned that when Lycophron discussed \\"whether the part and the whole are one or more than one\\" he avoided using the singular form of the verb \\"to be\\".Aristotle, Physics, Book 1, Part 2 In Rhetoric, Aristotle examines several peculiar expressions used by Lycophron, such as \\"the many-visaged sky of the mighty-peaked earth\\", \\"the narrow-passaged promontory\\", calling Xerxes \\"a monster of a man\\" and Sciron \\"a human destroyer\\". The same work includes another reference to a Lycophron, though it fits poorly with what is known of the sophist. Aristotle reports that an opponent of Lycophron and Peitholaus stated in a law-court that \\"These men used to sell you when they are at home, and now they have come here and bought you.\\" There is no context given to this phrase, though modern scholars suspect this is a reference to a case involving Lycophron I of Pherae, a tyrant.Aristotle, Rhetoric, Book 3, Part 9 In Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle mentions Lycophron as an example of changing the subject of a conversation when one has nothing to state on the original subject. He reports that once Lycophron was compelled by certain persons to speak in praise of the lyre. He reportedly found himself at a loss for words on this subject. So he offered a few words on the musical organ and then switched the topic to Lyra, the constellation named after it. Being more knowledgeable in this topic, he had much more to say.

He played college football for Baylor University. Early years Dickson attended Waco High School before moving on to Baylor University, where he became a two-way right tackle and a two-year starter. As a sophomore, he was a part of the upset win (13-7) against the University of Tennessee in the 1957 Sugar Bowl. Professional career =Los Angeles Rams= Dickson was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the first round (9th overall) of the 1959 NFL Draft. The Rams used him as a backup offensive tackle. He was waived on September 13, 1960. =Dallas Cowboys= On September 14, 1960, Dickson was claimed off waivers by the Dallas Cowboys and played as an offensive right tackle (8 starts). The Cowboys traded its first round draft choice in the 1961 NFL Draft, as part of the deal to get Eddie LeBaron from the Washington Redskins, so on December 27, 1960, he was traded along with a first round pick (#4-Gary Collins) in the 1962 NFL Draft, in exchange for the Cleveland Browns first round draft choice (thirteenth overall) in 1961, in order to select future hall of famer Bob Lilly, the first draft choice in Cowboys franchise history. =Cleveland Browns= On September 12, 1961, the Cleveland Browns traded him along with Jim Marshall, Jim Prestel, Dick Grecni, Jamie Caleb and Billy Gault, to the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for a second-round choice (#17-Chuck Hinton) and an eleventh-round pick (#142-Ronnie Meyers). =Minnesota Vikings= In 1961, Dickson was one of the original players in the Minnesota Vikings inaugural season. Following the trade, he was switched from right offensive tackle to defensive tackle - a position he would play for the rest of his career. In practice, he was known for playing at full-speed, much to the irritation of his teammates on the offensive side of the ball. He was the regular starter at right defensive tackle and a key player from 1962 to 1967. In 1968, he was passed on the depth chart by future hall of famer Alan Page. The next year, although he was a backup, he was still considered a part of the Vikings' famous \\"Purple People Eaters\\" or \\"The Four Norsemen\\" defensive line, which consisted mainly of Marshall (DE), Page (DT), Gary Larsen (DT), and Carl Eller (DE). He played in Super Bowl IV at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana, losing to the Kansas City Chiefs. In 1971, he spent time on the team's taxi squad before being released. =St. Louis Cardinals= On November 10, 1971, he was claimed off waivers by the St. Louis Cardinals, where he was reunited with his former defensive line coach with the Vikings, Bob Hollway, then in his first season as Cardinals head coach. He Joined the team on November 20, after reconsidering his retirement decision. He was cut during the 1972 training camp. =Chicago Bears= On May 3, 1972, he was claimed off waivers by the Chicago Bears, but was released before the start of the season. Personal life Dickson returned to Minneapolis, after his one season in St. Louis, to live and work in sales, marketing and customer relations for computer companies. He was also a member and president of the Minnesota chapter of the NFL Alumni Association. He was nicknamed \\"Suitcase\\" because of his large hands and feet. In January 1971, he joined Viking teammate Marshall in a snowmobile excursion that ended in tragedy. Planning to travel across the Great Divide of the Rocky Mountains, a party of 16 became fragmented, and then got caught in a blizzard, having to spend a frigid night in the snow with few provisions. Dickson, Marshall and three others huddled together in a grove of trees, and lit all the cash they had on them -- \\"Hundreds, twenties, ones, they were all the same denomination: burnable,\\" Marshall said‚Äîin order to start a small fire to avoid freezing. Although everyone was rescued the next day, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Hugh Galusha died of hypothermia. On June 7, 2011, he died of a blood infection. He was survived by his second wife Maureen and his two sons Scott and Slade from his first marriage.

Life and career Firth was born in Frodsham, England. He spent much of his time at school writing songs and it was only a few weeks before going to Cambridge to read English that he attended an Arvon Foundation course in West Yorkshire. This was run by Willy Russell and whilst on it, Firth had to write dialogue. He wrote about the only thing he knew - two sixteen-year- olds trying to write a song. Another course participant optioned it for his production company and Firth decided to become a writer. While at Cambridge he joined the Footlights where his contemporaries included David Baddiel who later invited him to contribute music to The Mary Whitehouse Experience on BBC radio. His first plays at this time were all directed by Sam Mendes. On leaving Cambridge, he wrote and composed music for the award winning Radio Four series And Now In Colour but was soon invited to meet Alan Ayckbourn in Scarborough and commissioned to write a play for the studio at the Stephen Joseph Theatre. His one-act play A Man Of Letters was a success and led to the commissioning of a full-length play from Ayckbourn, Neville's Island, which later transferred to the West End, has been seen in translation all round the world and has been in almost continuous production since its premiere. It was revived in the West End in 2013 at the Duke of York's Theatre.

The participants are usually motivated to lose weight by a wedding or some other important upcoming event in their lives. The show stars Tom Europe, a former CFL star turned celebrity trainer, who plays the role of the drill instructor at the bootcamp. Europe is often accompanied by Nadeen Boman, who helps the participants on the show learn about nutrition. Format The show begins with short clips of bystanders, discussing where they would like to lose the \\"last 10 pounds\\". The last person interviewed is then introduced as the subject of the episode, with a voice-over from Tommy discussing her/his goals and issues. The participants on the show are predominantly female. This introduction is usually followed by Tommy and Nadeen bursting into a social event and introducing themselves to the participant. They start by recording her/his weight, measurements, and, occasionally, body fat percentage, then Nadeen is shown cleaning out their cupboards of junk food while Tommy helps the subject pick out a target outfit (which is usually then requested two sizes smaller than the one that was picked). Usually Nadeen, (sometimes Tommy) runs the participant through a five-course, portion-controlled meal plan on what they will eat for the next four weeks. Tommy begins the exercises by assessing the participant's fitness level with a \\"drill test\\". The remainder of the show details the participant's struggles as s/he tries to lose weight. A midpoint weigh-in is featured, along with graphical computer predictions of what s/he might look like in five to ten years if s/he does not change to a healthier lifestyle. Occasionally, a \\"butt kick\\" is included in the second half of the episode, especially if the subject has been caught cheating at her/his diet or slacking in her/his exercise. The \\"final challenge\\" is the last obstacle the participant must conquer. During the challenge, the participant carries a 10-pound \\"backpack of burden\\" filled with unhealthy food(s) that s/he enjoyed prior to enlisting in bootcamp.

Born in New Orleans, he moved with his family to Cincinnati, Ohio in his youth. As a boy during the Civil War he served the Confederate Army in Schoolfield's Battery as a \\"powder monkey\\", a boy who carried gunpowder. He later served as a courier for General John Hunt Morgan. His nicknames included \\"The Buckingham Boss\\" and \\"Napoleon\\". Theater owner Whallen moved to Louisville in the 1870s and became the manager of a vaudeville theater, The Metropolitan. He opened the Buckingham Theater in 1880, a Burlesque, on Jefferson between Third and Fourth Street. Although he tried a few legitimate theater ventures, his wealth came from more prurient interests, and he never had a respectable reputation in Louisville. He came to own several theatres in other cities, including two in Brooklyn, and produced the lavish show, The South Before the War, one of the most successful shows of its era. Political boss It became necessary for Whallen to establish political ties in order to protect his business interests from the family and religious groups that periodically protested Burlesque and its ties to prostitution and gambling. In 1885 he engineered the election of mayor P. Booker Reed and was rewarded with the position Chief of Police. From that point on he was known as the \\"Buckingham Boss\\" (after the theater where he had his office) and influenced every Louisville and statewide Kentucky election for the rest of his life. In addition to bribing officials and controlling assistance programs, at his peak Whallen controlled the awarding of 1,200 city patronage jobs. For many years, Whallen virtually ran Louisville from his \\"Green Room\\" at the Buckingham. Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Arthur Krock recalled Whallen's dominance of Louisville politics in his memoirs, describing Whallen's Green Room as \\"the political sewer through which the political filth of Louisville runs.\\" Whallen successfully executed an especially wild scheme in 1892, when he was convinced his choice for city chancellor would lose a fair primary. As primaries were exempt from most election laws, he was able to convince the party that a house-to-house canvass would be superior to any other form of primary election. This had both the effect of disenfranchising thousands of voters who couldn't be at home at the specified times, and ensuring that bought votes were cast the way they were supposed to be. Throughout his career, Whallen used nearly every method imaginable to manipulate elections. He had police intimidate black voters, and had voting locations in Republican-heavy precincts moved at the last moment or colluded to create impossibly long waits at them. He hired repeat voters, bought votes, threatened to take away patronage jobs, and even managed to annul a primary election in 1899 when it appeared his candidate was going to lose. In 1900 Whallen's machinations were investigated after the assassination of Governor William Goebel. Whallen had attempted to bribe a senator to oppose Goebel just weeks before the assassination. The massively corrupt 1905 Louisville mayoral election, eventually invalidated by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, was the beginning of the end of his machine's power to buy elections outright. Whallen's machine did manage to elect its chosen candidates in 1909 and 1913, relying increasingly on race-baiting tactics to insinuate that blacks would be given equal rights if a Republican was elected. The machine lost its power after Whallen's death. Whallen was popular amongst Catholics, immigrants and blue- collar workers, who were often at the center of his schemes. Death and honors Whallen was made a Kentucky Colonel and known by the nickname \\"Colonel Johnny\\". He was also given the Cross of Honor, the highest award of the Daughters of the Confederacy. He was buried in Louisville's St. Louis Cemetery. His estate, Spring Bank Park, became Chickasaw Park after his death. His home at 4420 River Park Drive was razed in 1947 and became the site of Bishop Flaget High School.

It has a population of 1,470 (August 2009).Population statistics of Bohum√≠n The village lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.  History  The village was first mentioned in a written document in 1428. It was heavily influenced by the industry. At the beginning of the 20th century rapid industrial development occurred, this led also to a rise of the village's population. According to the Austrian census of 1910 the village had 3,016 inhabitants, 2,865 of whom had permanent residence there. The census asked people for their native language, 1,761 (61.5%) were German-speaking, 992 (34.6%) were Polish-speaking and 112 (3.9%) were Czech-speaking. Jews were not allowed to declare Yiddish, most of them thus declared the German language as their native. The most populous religious groups were Roman Catholics with 2,733 (90.6%) followed by Protestants with 112 (3.7%).Ludwig Patryn (ed): Die Ergebnisse der Volksz√§hlung vom 31.

Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. Czech footballer Tom√°≈° Posp√≠chal was born here.

It is located in the Agen commune, in the Aquitaine region of France. Description The aqueduct is a dressed stone masonry structure consisting of 23 arches, each of 20m span, which at the time of its completion was the longest navigable aqueduct in France. It has a length of 539 metres, a width of 12.48m and a canal width of 8.82m. The width of the channel is insufficient to allow boats to pass each other whilst on the aqueduct. Boats must wait for oncoming traffic to clear the aqueduct before crossing. There is a lock and a canal basin downstream, and a canal basin upstream, of the aqueduct. Agen Aqueduct History The aqueduct was built entirely of stone blocks from Quercy, under the direction of the engineer Jean-Baptiste de Baudre. On 25 August 1839 Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans laid the first stone. In 1841 the building of the Bordeaux to Toulouse railway interrupted work on the canal and the aqueduct was rented to farmers for use as a short cut avoiding the Bridge of Agen. The tolls however, were too high to make this idea work. On 5 May 1846 the work was ordered to resume by a vote in favour of a government act. The aqueduct finally came into service in 1849.

He played his club football for Wrexham, West Bromwich Albion and Southampton. Club career =Wrexham= Williams was born in Wrexham and attended Acton Park School before moving to Grove Park Grammar School, who he represented at football. He also played football for the Victoria Youth Club whilst working for an insurance company. He joined Wrexham (where his father was a director) as an amateur in August 1949, making five league appearances before being signed by West Bromwich Albion in November 1950. =West Bromwich Albion= At West Bromwich, he made his debut as a centre-forward before switching, firstly to wing-half, before settling into the full-back position. In 1954, Williams helped West Bromwich to reach the runners-up position in the Football League and seemed certain to replace the injured Stan Rickaby in the FA Cup Final, but manager Vic Buckingham opted instead for the more experienced Joe Kennedy. Described as having \\"a first rate temperament, splendid positional sense and a sure kick\\", Williams later developed a \\"notable\\" full-back partnership with Don Howe. Williams remained at West Bromwich for 12 years, making 226 league appearances, scoring six goals. =Southampton= In September 1962, he joined Southampton for a fee of ¬£15,000; the \\"Saints\\" manager Ted Bates needed Williams's experience to help guide the club towards the First Division. Williams made his debut on 19 September 1962, in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Chelsea, when he took over at right-back from Roy Patrick. He rarely missed a match over the next four years, although in 1965‚Äì66, he switched to left-back with the right-back position being filled by several players, including Ken Jones and Tommy Hare, before the signing of David Webb in March 1966. Williams's final match for Southampton came on 22 April 1966, shortly before the end of the season which saw the Saints celebrate promotion to the top flight for the first time. International career Williams made his debut for Wales in a friendly against Austria on 9 May 1954. He played for Wales on 43 occasions, including all Wales's group stage matches at the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden where Wales met Brazil in the Quarter-finals, going out 1‚Äì0 to a goal from Pel√©. In his autobiography \\"My Life and the Beautiful Game\\", written in 1977, Pel√© says of this match: > I remember only too well some of the Welsh players I have faced; it will be > hard ever to forget . . . the World Cup [quarter-final] of 1958 in Sweden, > and the excellent play of men like Hopkins and Bowen, Stuart Williams and > Sullivan, or the truly inspired goalkeeping of Jack Kelsey.\\"Quoted in \\"In > That Number ‚Äì A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC\\" Later career After his playing career he held various coaching and management jobs including as a trainer with West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa, Morton and Southampton and brief spell as manager with Iranian club Paykan in 1970‚Äì71, and Norwegian club Viking FK in 1974. Williams settled in Southampton, and after leaving the game he became a tyre salesman, and later a financial controller for a transport company.

His mother was Prodoulia, who was ethnically Greek. He was a youth at the time of his father's death in 1246 and could do little to prevent the Mongol conquest of Anatolia. For most of his tenure as the Seljuq Sultan of R√ªm, he shared the throne with one or both of his brothers, Kilij Arslan IV and Kayqubad II. His mother was the daughter of a Greek priest, and it was the Greeks of Nicaea from whom he consistently sought aid throughout his life. Mongol commander Baiju threatened him and warned him of being late with paying tribute and requested new pastures in Anatolia for the Mongol cavalry. The Mongols defeated Kaykaus who then fled to the Byzantine Balkan in 1256. The Byzantine court detained him, though, they welcomed him as usual. So Kaykaus's brother Kayqubad appealed to Berke Khan of the Golden Horde. Nogai invaded the Empire in 1265 and released him and his men after Emperor Michael detained an envoy from Cairo to Berke. Berke gave Kaykaus appanage in Crimea and had him married to his daughter, Urbay Khatun.Bruno De Nicola, Women in Mongol Iran: The Khatuns (2017), p. 115 He died an exile in 1279 or 1280 in Crimea. According to Rustam Shukurov, Kaykaus II \\"had dual Christian and Muslim identity, an identity which was further complicated by dual Turkic/Persian and Greek ethnic identity\\". Legacy Though deposed and exiled, Kaykaus remained popular among the Turkmen of Anatolia and a threat to the stability of the fragile Seljuq-Mongol relationship. The vizier Fakhr al-Din Ali was imprisoned for a time in 1271 for corresponding with him. It was from Kaykaus that Karamanoƒülu Mehmed Bey in 1276 sought help in his uprising against the Mongols. Since Kaykaus was in no position to help, Mehmed Bey thought it best to have a representative of Kaykaus‚Äô line on his side, even if only an imposter, and named Jimri as head of the revolt. Kaykaus later dispatched several of his sons from the Crimea as pretenders, one of which, Masud II, was ultimately successful in winning the Seljuq throne in 1280. Some modern historians consider the Byzantine noble Athanasios Soultanos to have been the brother or son of Kaykaus, but this is unlikely due to the later age Soultanos lived in. However another branch of the Christianized aristocratic family of the Soultanoi was indeed begun by a close relative of Kaykaus, whence their name. In the Ottoman period the rebel Sheikh Bedreddin, who drew support largely from Turkmen migrants to the Balkans, claimed descent from Kaykaus II.

After immigrating to the United States, he began a significant musical career as a cornet soloist and was billed as The World's Greatest Cornetist. He was widely regarded as a foremost player, although the claim of World's Greatest has some challengers. He was a member of Patrick Gilmore's band for several years, performing with them at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. He was also a tester and promoter for C.G. Conn, manufacturer of musical instruments. Levy's performed many pieces, among the most famous were \\"Una Voce\\" by Rossini, \\"Carnival of Venice\\", \\"Grand Russian Fantasia\\", and his favorite \\"Whirlwind Polka\\". He was arguably the first cornetist to be recorded, having participated in an early public demonstration of Thomas Edison's tinfoil phonograph. He later recorded commercially for Victor Records and Columbia Records. His son, Jules Levy, Jr., was also an accomplished cornetist and trumpeter. He recorded from 1919 to 1932,The JAZZ Discography - by Tom Lord at www.lordisco.com often with groups led by Joseph Samuels.

He was a part of the freshman basketball team that included Cliff Hagan and Frank Ramsey. In 1950, he was named the starting offensive end as a sophomore and contributed to Kentucky's best season under Bryant, finishing with an 11-1 record and a 13-7 upset in the Sugar Bowl over the eventual national champions the University of Oklahoma, also ending the Sooners' 31-game winning streak. As a senior, he was moved to the offensive tackle position and earned his second straight third-team All-SEC honors.

The Software Alliance, also known as BSA, is a trade group established by Microsoft in 1988 to represent commercial software makers.

About 2006, the BSA came under fire for offering reward money up to $200,000 USD to disgruntled employees that report current or former employers for alleged violations of BSA member software licenses. According to an article in Mother Jones magazine, the BSA discovered in 1995 that Antel, the Uruguayan national telephone company, had copied $100,000 worth of Microsoft, Novell, and Symantec software. The BSA's lawyers in Uruguay quickly filed suit, but dropped the suit in 1997 when Antel signed a \\"special agreement\\" with Microsoft to replace all of its software with Microsoft products. This has led to accusations that the BSA is a front for Microsoft, with its other members being enlisted purely to disguise Microsoft's dominant role. The BSA supported the highly controversial US Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). This has led to calls from various online communities that BSA members should be boycotted as a result of their perceived attack on the Internet's underlying structure. Kaspersky Lab has left the BSA over this. =BSA annual software piracy study= BSA has been heavily criticized about the yearly study it publishes about copyright infringement of software. This study, produced in collaboration with the International Data Corporation, tries to estimate the level of copyright infringement of software in different countries, as well as the resulting losses for the software industry.Third Annual BSA and IDC Global Software Piracy Study, May 2006. See also http://www.bsa.org/globalstudy/ for general information about the study. The methodology consists in estimating the number of computers shipped in a given country, as well as the average quantity of software installed on these machines. Separately, an estimation of the quantity of legitimate software sold in the country is produced, and the difference between the total amount of software estimated to be in use in the country and the estimation of software sold is used as an indicator of the rate of unauthorized copying. An estimation of the total amount lost is produced by multiplying the estimator number of unauthorized copies by the price of the original software. These estimates have been criticized as being exaggerated and many flaws of the methodology have been pointed out; some of the figures seem to be guesses rather than solid data, and some data may not be representative. The calculation of the losses, in particular, assumes that each piece of copied software represents a direct loss of sale for software companies, a very contested assumption. Alt URL The study's assumptions have been described as erroneous in a way \\"that would get a first year student of statistics into trouble\\". These criticisms have been aggravated by the use of the BSA study to lobby for new, stricter copyright laws and to seek tougher penalties for people convicted of copyright infringement on software. In Britain, a judge cited the data provided by the BSA to justify a lengthy prison sentence for two people convicted of copyright infringement. Another study claiming that software patents are of the same importance to small and medium enterprises and large companies, has been described as misleading and as using a flawed methodology, but the results have nevertheless been quoted by politicians.

It was among scores of regiments that were raised in the summer of 1864 as Hundred Days Men, an effort to augment existing manpower for an all-out push to end the war within 100 days. Service The 139th Illinois Infantry was organized at Peoria, Illinois, and mustered into Federal service on June 1, 1864, for a one- hundred-day enlistment. It departed for St. Louis by steamboat on June 8, arriving there on the 10th. From there it moved to Columbus, Kentucky, for a week, and from thence to Cairo, Illinois, where it performed garrison duty. Around August 1, the regiment was directed by General Payne, commanding the Department of Northern Kentucky, to raid several nearby farms owned by Confederate sympathizers, to seize horses and cattle to make up for livestock stolen by guerillas. The raid was successful, resulting also in the capture of two of the raiders. The regiment returned to Cairo until September 25, when it was returned to Peoria to be mustered out of service. Although its initial term of enlistment had expired, the regiment was asked by President Abraham Lincoln to assist Federal efforts against General Sterling Price during his Raid into Missouri. When the men agreed to go, Lincoln sent them a letter, thanking them for their patriotism and willingness to serve. The 139th marched toward Franklin, Missouri, as part of the Union pursuit of Price in October of that year, but the Battle of Westport on 23 October forced Price to retreat southward and ended the need for the 139th Regiment's service.

The Sphere: An Illustrated Newspaper for the Home and, later, The Sphere: The Empire's Illustrated Weekly, was a British newspaper, published by London Illustrated Newspapers weekly from 27 January 1900 until the closure of the paper on 27 June 1964. Background The first issue came out at the height of the Boer War and was a product of that conflict and the public appetite for images. At the time, it was in direct competition with The Graphic and Illustrated London News, and evidence of this rivalry can be seen in the latter's publication shortly after of a new illustrated paper entitled The Spear in an attempt to confuse readers. During World War I, the weekly issues were called 'war numbers' and over two hundred appeared between 1914 and 1919. In all, it totalled 3,343 issues, plus a special supplement issued in January 1965, entitled Winston Churchill: A Memorial Tribute.

He is one of the greatest liturgical poets and hymnographers of the Eastern Orthodox Church, but as a poet he is often confused with Joseph, the Archbishop of Thessalonica and brother of Theodore the Studite, who were one generation older than he was. He is also known for his confession of the Orthodox Faith in opposition to Iconoclasm. He is called in certain sources \\"the sweet-voiced nightingale of the Church\\".  Life  He was born around 816 AD in Sicily of devout parents, Plotinus and Agatha.The exact year of birth is not known, but it can be roughly assumed between 812 and 818, most probably soon after 816. Joseph's family had to flee from Sicily due to the Arab invasion of the island.The exact place of origin varied among different hagiographers. He was likely from the Val Demone of Sicily, where most of the Orthodox communities were located. Tomadakis (1971) dates his family's depart from Sicily to 831, from the port of Palermo which he also regards as his birth town. Theodore Pediasimos on the other hand regarded Syracuse as his port and birth town. According to the hagiographer Theophanes they went to Peloponnese. At the age of fifteen he was tonsured a monk at the Latomos Monastery of Thessalonica. About 840 the bishop of Thessalonica ordained him a hieromonk (priest-monk). While visiting Thessalonica the distinguished Gregory of Dekapolis was so impressed with Joseph, because of his rare character, that he invited him to join his Stoudios Monastery in Constantinople. = Iconodule mission to Rome = With the resurgence of Byzantine Iconoclasm under Leo V the Armenian and Theophilos, Joseph was sent by Gregory to Rome following an invitation of Pope Leo III in 841. While en route, Joseph was captured by slave-trading pirates and sold as a slave in Crete. In slavery St. Nicholas appeared to Joseph and asked him to sing in the name of God. Nicholas then said to him: \\"Arise and follow me!\\" Joseph found freedom soon after his vision. He could finally return to Constantinople after more than one year in slavery in Crete.Later hagiographic legends, probably influenced by the inventions of Theodore Pediasimos, tent to prolong his stay as a prisoner to six years. The vision of Nicholas of Myra which is directly connected with Theophilos' death, ends with a direct exit from the prison's gates to Constantinople. They also regard the \\"Saracene\\" pirates as hired by the iconoclastic emperor. Berbers often acted as slave traders on their own behalf and they were particular interested in educated Greeks due to their high value on Mediterranean slave markets. According to hagiographic conventions, Joseph's adventurous journey to Rome was treated as a via purgativa. Theophanes is not clear, when Joseph returned to Constantinople, but he mentioned in one paragraph a triumphal return after the death of Theophilos and the restoration of the icons, but also after the recent death of Gregory of Decapolis.According to Tomadakes' interpretation of Theophanes' Vita Joseph was liberated after 28 January 842, and arrived at Constantinople by February 843, before the feast of Orthodoxy on March 11 (Stiernon 1973, 252). = Monastic foundations = According to the temporal reconstruction of the early vitae by Daniel Stiernon, Joseph founded a monastery dedicated to his deceased mentor, Gregory of Dekapolis, in 855. Joseph started with an inclosure together with his and Gregory's disciple John at St. Antipas. After the latter's death in 850, he spent some years in a kind of sanctuary dedicated to St. John Chrysostom, where he continued his ascetic labors and attracted followers. Joseph transferred the relics taken from Gregory's corpse, together with those from their disciple named John,The earliest hagiographic sources are not clear to which saint the relics do really belong. Gregory, Bartholomew, and John (in Georgian versions) are mentioned, but they probably do not refer to Joseph's circle, but to Joseph's own hagiographic synaxaries dedicated to Bartholomew the Apostle and John of Egypt (Stiernon 1973, 260). and placed them in a sanctuary of his monastery's church dedicated to St. Bartholomew the Apostle.Daniel Stiernon (1973, 252f) proposed the following datation: the enclosure with his disciple John at the hermitage St. Antipas (843-850), John's death (850), Joseph's stay at a sanctuary (œÉ·øÜŒ∫ŒøœÇ) of St. John Chrysostom (850-855), and the foundation of his monastery (855). = Exile and recognition as an anachorete and saint = In 858, he was exiled to the theme of Cherson after denouncing Caesar Bardas, brother of the Empress Theodora, for illicit cohabitation. Joseph returned again to Constantinople in 867, after Bardas had been assassinated.Ev. Tomadakes (Stierson 1973, 253) dates the exile during the first patriarchate of Photius (858-867). Through the favour of the Patriarch Ignatius I, he was appointed skeuophylax (keeper of the sacred vessels‚Äîi.e., the official responsible for the building containing the treasure of the church) in the Great Church of Constantinople. Joseph also stood high in the favor of Patriarch Photius the Great, the rival and successor of Ignatius, and accompanied Photius into banishment. He was among those who inspired the first missionaries to Russia. He reportedly possessed the \\"gift of discernment\\" because of which Photius appointed him the spiritual father and confessor for priests, recommending him as, \\"A man of God, an angel in the flesh and father of fathers.\\" He died 3 April 886 AD according to Theophanes. = Hagiography and Menologion = Joseph the Hymnographer appears as well in Latin as in Greek hagiography.About the hagiographic sources (BHG, p. 131) and their interpretation, see Daniel Stiernon (1973, 245-248). The earliest Vita was written by Theophanes who followed Joseph in his monastery as hegoumenos.See the edition by Athanasios Papadapulos-Kerameus (1901). There is a later synaxarion written by John the Deacon whose exact identity is still a controversial matter,It was likely to be written during the eleventh century. A summary of the controversy offers Stiernon (1973, 248). Godfrey Henschen's edition of the synaxarion was reprinted at PG (105). and a much later Vita written by Theodore Pediasimos during the early Palaiologan period.See the edition by Maximilian Treu (1899). According to the Greek tradition the feast of Joseph the Hymnographer is celebrated on April 3, according to the Slavic rite on April 4, and on June 14 in communities of the Roman Catholic Church.  The Hymnographer  Since Joseph's contribution to the Studites reform is often confused with the works of Joseph of Thessalonica, Theodore's brother, the exact attribution of poems \\"by Joseph\\" is still a controversial issue. Evtychios Tomadakes attributed 385 canons and 9 kontakiaSee the edition by Elpidio Mioni (1948). of the menaion, 68 canons of the parakletike, 6 complete canons of the triodion and 34 triodes-tetraodes, 2 canons and 24 triodes- tetraodes of the pentekostarion to the Sicilian Joseph. He also created more than 6 canons and 13 stichera‚Äîso-called apokrypha which were not included in the new chant books of the sticherarion created by the Studites.Evtychios Tomadakes (1971). See the review by Daniel Stiernon (1973, 244). This attribution regards Joseph more or less as the author or even inventor of the Parakletike, but earlier sources which had been recently discovered, do not confirm this view, it rather reframes the question, how the repertoire was changed and re-ordered by Joseph's initiative.  Reception  His hymns are still sung, not only by Eastern Christians, but by Western Christians as well. A number of his hymns have been adapted into popular Protestant hymns.

It meant that the village was supposed to pay tithe from 5 greater lans. The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century on the territory of what will be later known as Upper Silesia. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. At the beginning of the 20th century rapid industrial development occurred, leading to a rise of the village's population. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, the village became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. There is a Catholic church in the village.

Its native lines have been influenced by scenthounds of French breeding brought back to Switzerland by mercenaries. In 1882, a standard was established for each of the five varieties of the Swiss Hound. In 1909, those standards were revised and the total disappearance of the hound of Thurgovie was noted. On 22 January 1933, one single standard was established for the five varieties of the Swiss Hound. The most ancient variety, the St. Hubert Jura Hound, is very rare nowadays. This ancient variety is still used for hunting in some areas in France and Canada.

He scored 145 goals in the Football League from 396 appearances with five clubs. Internationally he won 13 caps and scored five goals, and was a member of the Welsh squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden although he did not play during the tournament. Leek started his career with Northampton Town aged 17 despite only playing football for three years. After six years, he earned a move to First Division Leicester City. He had three seasons at Leicester, and scored in every round of the FA Cup en route to the 1961 final. He was dropped from the final and soon moved on to Newcastle United. His stay with Newcastle was brief and he signed for Birmingham City before the end of the year, having had a loan spell in Canada with Montreal Concordia. He played more than 100 games with Birmingham, scoring nearly a goal every other game including two in the 1963 League Cup triumph against rivals Aston Villa. He returned to Northampton, helping them to promotion to the top flight before finishing his professional career with Bradford City. His career took him onto three Welsh non-league sides. Early life Leek was born on 26 July 1935 in Ynysybwl, South Wales, where he lived next door to Birmingham City and future Welsh international footballer Don Dearson. He attended two rugby-playing schools before taking up football himself at the age of 14. He also spent two years in national service. Club career As a teenager, Leek played football for Ynysybwl Boys attracting a number of club scouts. In August 1952, he signed for Third Division South side Northampton Town. He soon appeared for the first team and also won honours for the Welsh under-23 side. He scored for Northampton in their 1958 FA Cup triumph against First Division side Arsenal. In six years with Northampton, he had a strike-rate of one goal every three games, scoring 27 goals from 71 league games, and was also given a testimonial match. He left Northampton in May 1958 to join First Division side Leicester City for a fee of ¬£10,000 as an inside left or outside left. The same summer, he travelled with the Welsh national side to Sweden for the World Cup. He made his Leicester debut on 23 August against Everton, scoring once in a 2‚Äì0 victory. His goals ratio helped him to compete with Derek Hines for the centre forward position. He scored in every round of the 1960‚Äì61 FA Cup competition to help Leicester reach the final. However, after Leek's celebrations after the semi-final victory, manager Matt Gillies dropped his striker and replaced him with Hughie McIlmoyle for the final, which Leicester lost 2‚Äì0 to Tottenham Hotspur. He left Leicester just weeks later, having scored 43 goals in 108 appearances, with 34 of those coming in 93 league matches. He signed for Newcastle United for ¬£25,000 for whom he scored a hat-trick on his debut in a friendly against Danish side Aarhus. However, his stay with Newcastle was only a short one and he was loaned to Canadian side Montreal Concordia before returning to the Midlands by the end of the year, with Birmingham City, costing ¬£23,000. In three years with Birmingham, he scored 49 goals from 104 appearances in the league. He also scored two goals in the first leg of the club's League Cup victory against their local rivals Aston Villa in the 1963 final. Before Birmingham's appearance in the 2001 final, Leek said: \\"It was a very proud moment for me when we lifted the cup.\\" He returned to Northampton in 1964 at a cost of ¬£10,000, spending one season with the Cobblers and helped them win promotion from the Second Division. The following season, he scored the club's first goal in the top division to give them a victory against West Ham United. In November 1965, Leek joined Bradford City for a club record fee of ¬£10,000, becoming one of new chairman Stafford Heginbotham's first signings. He made his debut against Doncaster Rovers on 6 November 1965 and finished his first season as top scorer with 11 goals. He spent three seasons with City, also playing in midfield, scoring 25 goals from 99 league games, and adding a goal in the League Cup. He left Bradford in June 1968 to return to Wales as a player-coach with non-league side Rhyl. He played for other Welsh sides Merthyr Town and Ton Pentre before retiring in 1970. International career Leek was a non-playing member of Wales's squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden. It took another two years for him to win his first international cap for Wales in a 2‚Äì0 victory against Scotland during the 1961 British Home Championship. He followed it up with games against the other home nations, England and Northern Ireland, among six caps that year. He won another three caps in 1962, and played for a second time against England in 1963. It was another two years before he was selected again, winning three more in 1965, the latter two being both in 1966 World Cup qualifying matches against Greece. His goals included two in the final minutes of a 1965 British Home Championship game against Scotland to give his country a 3‚Äì2 victory, which Leek said was his \\"favourite memory\\" of Cardiff. Playing style Leek initially played as an inside or outside left forward but moved to centre forward early in his career. He was tall and said to be \\"effective in the air\\", had pace and was adept with both feet. He also suffered from injuries because of his robust style. Former Leicester teammate Gordon Banks said of Leek: \\"He was a terrific player ‚Äì a great centre forward. He was very elusive and caused a lot of problems for centre halves.\\" Personal life Leek was married to Janet, with whom he had two daughters and four grandchildren. After his playing career, the family settled in Daventry, with Leek working for the Ford Motor Company before retiring in 1995. He died in Daventry, aged 72, on 19 November 2007, after a short illness. His grandson Karl Darlow became a professional footballer as a goalkeeper.

Over decades of use by the Board of Education, the building became known for the entrenched bureaucracy and dysfunction of its occupants, and Michael Cooper of The New York Times stated that the building's name eventually came to symbolize the failings of the New York City school system, as \\"more than a location or a shorthand name for the institution it housed, the city's Board of Education.

She is considered the \\"Mother\\" of St. Louis, and was influential in its founding and development, in essence, helping lead to its becoming an important American town and the Gateway to the West.  Early life  She was born in New Orleans on January 13, 1733. She had a French father (Nicolas Bourgeois) and Spanish mother (Marie Joseph Tarare).Marie Ther√®se Bourgeois Chouteau (Madame Chouteau) Shortly after she turned six years old, her father died, leaving her mother, her two siblings, and herself. The following year, Marie-Ther√®se's mother remarried to a man named Nicholas Pierre Carco. She lived with her mother and stepfather until her marriage, and it is thought that she returned to their household when her marriage fell apart four years later. At the age of 15, Marie-Ther√®se married tavern keeper and baker Ren√© Auguste Chouteau, Sr., on September 20, 1748. This arrangement was made by her family, with everyone expecting that the marriage would be successful. According to commonly accepted histories, Ren√© deserted her after she gave birth to Ren√© Auguste Chouteau, Jr., in 1749. Upon being deserted by Ren√©, Marie-Ther√®se referred to herself as a widow as it gave her more legal and social rights. As a widow, she could own property and have custody over her children.  Relationship with Lacl√®de  She began a relationship with Pierre Lacl√®de around 1755. With him, she had four children: Jean Pierre Chouteau in 1758, Marie Pelagie (1760), Marie Louise (1762), and Victoire (1764). After Lacl√®de (along with his stepson and her son with Rene, Auguste Junior) established St. Louis, Missouri in 1764, Marie-Therese traveled with her other four children to the new, developing colony. At first, she lived with all the other settlers at the trading post. However, Lacl√®de is said to have built her a house in 1767. During this time, she kept busy, owning cattle, keeping bees, and conducting business. A few years later, the elder Ren√© Chouteau demanded that authorities return her to New Orleans. In 1774 Louisiana Governor Luis de Unzaga ordered her to return. However she did not and the order was ignored until the elder Chouteau died in 1776. Though this freed her from her marriage and allowed her to marry Lacl√®de, Marie-Therese refrained from doing so. At this time, Lacl√®de had fallen into a lot of debt, and though she loved him, she did not want to be legally responsible for paying off his creditors after his death, an event that happened soon after.  Legacy and Success in St. Louis  Lacl√®de died in 1778. Afterwards, Marie-Ther√®se remained in the stone house Lacl√®de built for her. From then until her death, she continued to be an influential, successful figure in the St. Louis colony. In addition, she helped her sons with controlling the fur trade; these sons later became leaders in St. Louis government and business for the years to follow, drawing from many of her key attributes. Her daughters as well were successful in their own right; given her large fortune at this time, Marie-Therese helped them marry well by giving them large dowries. Upon the death of Madame Chouteau on August 14, 1814, she was buried on the grounds of the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France (which is now on the grounds of the Gateway Arch National Park). However, when bodies were dug up in 1849 to move them to Calvary Cemetery and Bellefontaine Cemetery during a cholera epidemic, her remains could not be found.  Challenges to the legend  Virtually all contemporary histories of St. Louis attribute a founding role to her including The First Chouteaus: RIVER BARONS OF EARLY ST. LOUIS by William E Foley and C David Rice and Before Lewis and Clark: The Story of the Chouteaus, the French Dynasty That Ruled America's Frontier by Shirley Christian . However, there have been challenges to the story, including challenges by her descendants. Part of the challenge were considered efforts to show that she did not have a relationship outside of marriage. Other challenges were based on formal records. Records at the St. Louis Cathedral (New Orleans) indicate that all the Chouteau children were baptized there and indicated the elder Chouteau was the father. Further records indicate that Lacl√®de did not leave his inheritance to the Chouteaus while the elder Chouteau did.Chronicles of Oklahoma Volume 12, No. 2 June, 1934 The legend says that Lacl√®de and Marie had a common law marriage and that Lacl√®de signed away part of his property to them to protect them and maintain the appearance that Marie was in a proper civil law relationship with the elder Chouteau. However, one 1790s account, published in translation, by a French officer serving the Spaniards, Nicolas de Finiels, notes no founding role for Chouteau and even goes as far as to say there was already a hamlet at the site of St. Louis even before the founding of St. Louis. The tale of Chouteau's role in the founding of St. Louis does not appear in the historical introduction of the first St. Louis city directory in 1820, and his name was not mentioned at all at the first celebration of the town's past in 1847. A New Orleans militia census conducted after Laclede had departed New Orleans Archivo General Des Indies, Audiencia De Santo Domingo, Legajo 2515, published in translation in 1972 shows him still at home with his mother and brothers. The earliest St. Louis historian, Wilson Primm, dismissed the story. Auguste's role in the founding is based on his own testimony in a land dispute in the 1820s, and on an unsigned manuscript \\"Journal\\" attributed to him, announced found by his sole surviving son, Gabriel, in 1857.

The earliest record found of a person named Landry was in the 5th Century ca. 450 in the person of St. Landry, third Bishop of S√©es who died on March 4, 480 and whose feast day is July 16. Landry was the successor of Saint Sigibold, himself successor of Saint Latuin (Latuinus, Lain, or Latuin), first occupant of the episcopal see (from 400 to 440). He lived in great sanctity and was responsible for great progress of Christianity in his diocese. It appears that this was done in spite of great resistance, because in his legend, it is said that he was placed in a barrel filled with flax combs and rolled from the top to the bottom of a mountain. Nevertheless, this fact is not ascertained and he died at a great age on March 4, 480, in the arms of Saint Contest, Bishop of Bayeux, who happened to be in Seez at the time. Veneration He was buried in his cathedral dedicated to the Virgin. It is not the magnificent gothic building that can still be seen, because the one in which Saint Landry rested was destroyed in 878, during the invasion by the Saxons. His name appears in the Martyrology of Ainon and as soon as the eleventh century there was a saint's day for him on July 16. Focoal inserted in a Breviary a double service in his honor.

Previously an incorporated municipality, Clairmont dissolved from village status on January 1, 1946 to become part of the Municipal District of Bear Lake No. 740. Clairmont is located in the Peace Country, along Highway 2, approximately north of Grande Prairie and south of Sexsmith. Clairmont lies at an elevation of , on the western shore of Clairmont Lake. Initially the area was commonly known as Twin Lakes. The first use of the name \\"Clairmont\\" was in 1907 by the earliest surveyor of the township boundaries, JB Saint Cyr.  History  Clairmont circa 1917 Development of the townsite really got started once it was surveyed and after the arrival of the Edmonton, Dunvegan & British Columbia Railway in 1916. By the end of 1916, the townsite had a railway station, two or three grain elevators, an agent's house, the Buffalo Lakes Lumber Yard, Clairmont Hotel, a Union Bank, a butcher shop, several stores, a Baptist church, and a handful of residences. On September 10, 1915 the Clairmont Lake School District was opened. A post office was established in 1916. In 1922, a large fire consumed many Clairmont businesses, while a train station was built in 1923. Clairmont was incorporated as a village in 1917, but renounced the village status in 1946 after a downturn in economy caused by the great depression. It eventually became the location of the County of Grande Prairie No. 1's municipal office. A new school was built with municipal funding in 2007 and opened in 2008.

Located in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the house, which was designed by Priestley's wife Mary, is Georgian with Federalist accents. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) operated it as a museum dedicated to Joseph Priestley from 1970 to August 2009, when it closed due to low visitation and budget cuts. The house reopened in October 2009, still owned by the PHMC but operated by the Friends of Joseph Priestley House (FJPH). Fleeing religious persecution and political turmoil in Britain, the Priestleys emigrated to the United States in 1794 seeking a peaceful life. Hoping to avoid the political troubles that had plagued them in Britain and the problems of urban life they saw in the United States, the Priestleys built a house in rural Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, political disputes and family troubles dogged Priestley during the last ten years of his life. After the Priestleys died, their home remained in private hands until the turn of the 20th century, when George Gilbert Pond, a professor from what is now Pennsylvania State University, bought it and attempted to found the first Priestley museum. He died before he could complete the project and it was not until the 1960s that the house was first carefully restored by the PHMC and designated a National Historic Landmark. A second renovation was undertaken in the 1990s to return the home to the way it looked during Priestley's time. The home has been a frequent place of celebration for the American Chemical Society; they commemorated the centennial and bicentennial of the discovery of oxygen gas by Priestley as well as the 250th anniversary of Priestley's birth. Location Map of eastern Pennsylvania showing important locations for the history of Joseph Priestley and the area Following the French and Indian War (1755‚Äì63) and the forced migration of Native American tribes westward, German, Scots-Irish, and other European immigrants settled in the central Susquehanna Valley, including in the area that would become Northumberland, Pennsylvania.Hirsch, 25; Bell, 517‚Äì18. Northumberland was laid out around a central village green in 1772, on land originally purchased from the Iroquois by the Province of Pennsylvania in 1768, as part of the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix. During the American Revolution, the village was evacuated as part of the Big Runaway in 1778, and only finally resettled in 1784.McMinn, \\"[ National Register of Historic Places Registration: Northumberland Historic District]\\" (PDF). In 1794, when the Priestleys moved there, it included Quaker and Wesleyan meeting houses, a brewery, two potteries, a potash manufacturer, a clock maker, a printer (who issued a weekly newspaper), several stores, and approximately one hundred houses.Schofield, 346‚Äì47; Kieft, 7. Map of Northumberland, Pennsylvania showing the Priestley House at the confluence of the North and West branches of the Susquehanna Rivers The Priestley property, purchased in 1794 at a total cost of ¬£500 (¬£ in ) from Reuben Haines, who had secured the patent to the land for Northumberland,Schofield, 347; Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 21. comprised four lots of the original village plan (numbers 29‚Äì32). Currently, the house and grounds occupy 1 acre (4,000 m¬≤) at 472 Priestley Avenue. (The address of the house was originally \\"North Way\\", but the street was later renamed in honor of Joseph Priestley.Bell, 515‚Äì45.) This street forms the northwest boundary of the property; the other boundaries are Hanover Avenue to the northeast, Wallis Street to the southwest, and the North Shore Railroad to the southeast. Beyond the railroad line is a baseball field, and beyond that lies the Susquehanna River, which was the original southeastern boundary of the property. The confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the main (or North) branch of the Susquehanna is a short distance southwest of the property, which is at an elevation of 456 feet (139 m). The property's original area was 2 acres (8,000 m¬≤),Glazer, \\"Scientist Discovered Oxygen\\". but this was reduced by about half around 1830 when the Pennsylvania Canal (North Branch Division) was dug through the house's front yard, between the house and river. On May 31, 1860, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad opened with a train from Danville. This was the second railroad track in Northumberland, and ran behind the house.Kieft, 11; Bell, 531. The canal closed in 1902 and was later filled in. The modern railroad line approximates the canal's course through the front yard; the track behind the house no longer exists. Priestleys in America alt=Half- length portrait of elderly man with wispy brown hair. He is wearing a black jacket and a white shirt. =Emigration to Northumberland= The last three years the Priestleys spent in Britain were a time of political upheaval and the persecution they experienced led to their eventual emigration to the United States. During the Birmingham Riots of 1791, which began on the second anniversary of the storming of the Bastille in the wake of the conservative British reaction against the French revolution, the Priestleys' home, Joseph's church, and the homes of many other religious Dissenters were burned. The Priestleys fled Birmingham and attempted to live in London, but they could not escape the political turmoil.Schofield, 317‚Äì21. In 1794, they joined the tide of 10,000 emigrants who moved to America‚Äîit was the largest emigration from Europe to America until the end of the Napoleonic Wars.Hirsch, 25; Graham, 1. The Priestleys left Britain at the beginning of April on the SamsonThe ship's name was the Samson according to Kieft (7), but Schofield (324) has it as the Sansom. and arrived in New York City on June 4, 1794.Schofield, 324. Two of their three sons, Joseph, Jr. (eldest) and Harry (youngest), had already emigrated to the United States in August 1793, along with Joseph Priestley's friend, the radical activist Thomas Cooper.Graham, 29. Their middle son, William, had moved to America from France, probably early in 1793, following the September massacres of the previous year.Rail, 158; Kieft, 6. Although Europeans knew Priestley best as a scientist (he had discovered oxygen gas in 1774), Americans knew him best as a defender of religious freedom and as an advocate for American independence.Schofield, 326. Immediately upon his arrival, he was f√™ted by various political factions vying to gain his support. Priestley declined their entreaties, however, hoping to avoid the political discord that had embroiled him in Britain. He wrote to John Adams that he \\"made it a rule to take no part whatever in the politics of a country in which I am a stranger, and in which I only wish to live undisturbed\\".Qtd. in Graham, 39. (Priestley never became a citizen of the United States.Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 22) He also turned down an opportunity to teach chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania at this time.Schofield, 324‚Äì32; Graham, 39‚Äì40, 48‚Äì50, 64. On their way to Northumberland, the Priestleys stopped in Philadelphia, where Joseph gave a series of sermons that helped promote the spread of Unitarianism. According to J. D. Bowers, who studied Priestley's influence on Unitarianism in America, \\"[f]or a decade Priestley served as the inspiration and leading force in the spread of Unitarianism in America and the formation of numerous societies that followed his teachings on congregational formation, the education of youth, lay preaching, and espousing one's faith in the presence of opposition from (and to) both the Protestant majority and a competing liberal faction.\\"Bowers, 2. Through Priestley's influence, at least twelve congregations were founded in Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky, including the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia and Northumberland's Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Susquehanna Valley.Bowers, 3.Priestley Chapel History: The Beginning When he preached, Unitarians and non-Unitarians flocked to hear him and his sermons were published throughout the country. During his years in America, Priestley became increasingly convinced that the Millennium was approaching. His close study of the Bible, together with the happenings in France, persuaded him that he would see Christ's return.Garrett, \\"Priestley's Religion\\", 12. Mary Priestley, who designed the house, by alt=Quarter-length portrait, showing a woman in a brown and gray lace bonnet with a bow and leaning on her right hand. While Priestley enjoyed preaching in Philadelphia, he could not afford the expense of living there; he also disliked the city's opulent Quakers and feared the yellow fever epidemic that had recently decimated the city.Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 62, 67. He considered settling in Germantown, which had better access to transportation and communication than Northumberland, but Mary preferred the country and wanted to be near her sons. Joseph considered splitting his time between Northumberland and Philadelphia, but this plan became impractical. Determined to ensure the future economic stability of his family, Priestley bought land and settled in Northumberland by July 1794, which was \\"five days of rough travel\\" north of Philadelphia.Kieft, 7. There they hoped a larger community would eventually blossom.Schofield, 346; Graham, 60‚Äì61; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 62. =Settling in= Priestley seems to have yearned for a more cosmopolitan community than Northumberland provided, writing to his sister that it was \\"seemingly almost out of the world\\" and complaining that he had to wait a week for news. He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: \\"We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs.\\"Qtd. in Graham, 61; see also 64‚Äì65. In the winter of 1794‚Äì95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very \\"distant from my original views\\" and \\"my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England\\", yet he was \\"very thankful for such an asylum\\" and he attempted \\"to make the best of my situation\\".Qtd. in Graham, 68; see also 71, 76. In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home.Graham, 80. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: \\"I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as the place I now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners.\\"Qtd. in Kieft, 7. Priestley's son Joseph Priestley Jr. was a leading member of a consortium that purchased of land along Loyalsock Creek (between the North and West Branches of the Susquehanna River).Park, 14-24, 52-57. Shortly thereafter, Thomas Cooper, a friend of Joseph Priestley's, published a pamphlet in Britain titled Some Information Respecting America, meant to encourage others to settle in Pennsylvania and offering instructions on how to do so. It detailed a clear plan for establishing and financing a settlement. The French translation, Renseignemens sur l'Am√©rique,Cooper was, according to one scholar, \\"carefully phrased in legal terminology\\" and \\"lucidly outline[d] an ambitious financial venture\\".Kelly, 219. However, it is unclear whether Cooper's scheme was related to the lands that the younger Priestleys had purchased. alt=A photograph of a replica of a burning lens Apparently technically unrelated to either of these schemes, but influenced by Cooper's, poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, full of idealism and angered at Priestley's treatment in Birmingham, intended to emigrate to America and establish a utopian community which they called \\"Pantisocracy\\" (derived from the Greek for \\"equal rule of all\\").Kelly, 218‚Äì20. They assembled twelve couples who were interested not only in demanding physical labor but also in a life of the mind, but none of them had enough money to embark on the project, which required much capital. Therefore, the poets undertook a lecture tour of England to raise funds; however, they never generated enough money and never emigrated. The utopia was not built and few immigrants arrived in Northumberland as a result of Cooper's schemes.Hirsch, 20‚Äì21; see also Schofield, 329‚Äì30. After the failure of Cooper's endeavor, Priestley attempted to convince other friends to move to Northumberland, particularly those he had made in America, but to no avail.Schofield, 346; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 62. Priestley wrote in his Memoirs that \\"the settlement was given up, but being here, and my wife and myself liking the place, I have determined to take up my residence here, though subject to many disadvantages. Philadelphia was excessively expensive, and this a comparatively cheap place; and my sons, settling in the neighborhood, will be less exposed to temptation, and more likely to form habits of sobriety and industry.\\" =Last years= Priestley's attempts to avoid political controversy in the United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley and his friends were fomenting a revolution.Schofield, 329‚Äì38; Graham 53‚Äì54, 110‚Äì14. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.Priestley, Joseph. Letters to the inhabitants of Northumberland and its neighbourhood, on subjects interesting to the author, and to them. Parts I & II. Northumberland [Pa.]: Printed for the author by Andrew Kennedy, 1799. Family matters also made Priestley's time in America difficult. His youngest son Harry died on December 11, 1795, probably of malaria. Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; she was already ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death.Schofield, 348. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: \\"This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and now that it is far advanced and promises to be everything she wished, she is removed to another.\\"Qtd. in Kieft, 8. After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the Reading Advertiser to falsely accuse Priestley's son William, of trying to poison them with arsenic.RailSchofield, 405‚Äì06. alt=Photograph of a bedroom, showing two chairs and a tea table in front of a fireplace. The room is painted white and the furniture is of a dark wood. Priestley continued the educational projects that had been important to him throughout his life, helping to establish a \\"Northumberland Academy\\" and donating his library to the fledgling institution. He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with Thomas Jefferson, who used the advice when founding the University of Virginia. Jefferson and Priestley became close and when he had completed his General History of the Christian Church,Priestley, Joseph. A General History of the Christian Church. Northumberland: Printed for the author by Andrew Kennedy, 1803. he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that \\"it is now only that I can say I see nothing to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me.\\"Qtd. in Schofield, 339‚Äì43. Of all of the religious works Priestley published in the United States, and there were many, it was his four-volume General History that was the most important. Stretching from 475 CE to Priestley's present, he tracked and explained what he saw as the history of Christianity and its \\"corruptions\\", referencing his own An History of the Corruptions of Christianity (1772‚Äì74). However, he ended it by praising American religious toleration.Schofield, 390‚Äì92. Priestley attempted to continue his scientific investigations in America with the support of the American Philosophical Association. However, he was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending the outmoded phlogiston theory against the \\"new chemistry\\", he also did some original work on spontaneous generation and dreams. As Robert Schofield, Priestley's major modern biographer, explains: > Priestley published more scientific items during his decade in the United > States than during all his years in England: some 45 papers, not counting > reprintings, and four pamphlets, not counting subsequent editions, but in > general his science was now anticlimactic. Few of his papers contributed > anything significantly new to the field of chemistry; most were committed to > combatting the new chemistry.Schofield, 354. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific importance, he stimulated an interest in chemistry in America.Schofield, 352‚Äì72. By 1801, Priestley had become so ill that he could no longer write or experiment effectively. On February 3, 1804, Joseph started a last experiment in his lab but was too weak to continue it. He went to a bed in his library, where he died three days later. He was buried in nearby Riverview Cemetery in Northumberland.MacDermott, 43‚Äì44. Priestley's epitaph reads: Architecture and landscaping alt=A 19th-century architectural drawing, showing three views of the house: from the front, the back, and as a floorplan. Joseph and Mary lived with their son Joseph, Jr. and his family in a small house while theirs was being built. Mary Priestley was primarily responsible for the design of the couple's new home and her family inheritance may have helped finance it, but she died before it was completed.Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 63. By 1797, Joseph's laboratory was completed‚Äîthe first part of the home to be finished. It was the first laboratory that \\"he had designed, built, and outfitted entirely himself\\"Hirsch, 27. and was probably the first \\"scientifically- equipped laboratory\\" in the United States.Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 61. Joseph continued his scientific and scholarly work in his new laboratory, identifying carbon monoxide (which he called \\"heavy inflammable air\\").Suplee, Joseph Priestley: Discoverer of Oxygen .Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 20. In 1798 Joseph Jr., his wife, and their children moved into the new house with Joseph Priestley. The house also held Priestley's library, which contained about 1600 volumes by his death in 1804 and was one of the largest in America at the time. The Priestley family held Unitarian church services in the drawing room and Joseph educated a group of young men until the local Northumberland Academy that he helped found was completed.Hirsch, 40‚Äì41; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 61. The house proper was completed in 1798, with a Mr. Jones of Northumberland employed acting as master carpenter.This chronology follows Hirsch, Kieft, and Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", however McMinn gives the completion date for the whole house as 1797; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 63. Built in an 18th-century Georgian style, the \\"balance and symmetry\\" of the architecture signaled \\"subdued elegance\\".Hirsch, 28. The house was accented with Federalist highlights, such as \\"the fanlights over the doors and the balustrades on the rooftop belvedere and main staircase\\", marking it as distinctly American.Hirsch, 29. Douglas R. McMinn, in the National Register of Historic Places nomination for the Northumberland Historic District, calls it a \\"mansion\\" that is \\"probably the finest example of the Federal style in the region\\". As William N. Richardson, the site administrator for the Joseph Priestley House in the 1990s, notes, Priestley's American home did not resemble his \\"high-style Georgian town house\\" that was destroyed in Birmingham; rather, it was \\"plain\\" and built in the \\"American vernacular\\". The house has a two-and-half story central section, which is 48 feet (14.6 m) by 43 feet (13.1 m), and two one-story wings on the north and south sides that are each 22 feet (6.7 m) by 21 feet (6.4 m). The first and second floors have a total area of 5,052 square feet (469 m¬≤).If the cellar and attic are included, the total area of the house is 9,180 square feet (853 m¬≤). The north wing was the laboratory and the south wing (which had an attached woodshed) was the summer kitchen. The cellar, first, and second floors of the central section are each divided into four rooms, with a central hall on the first and second floors; the first floor also has an intersecting hall that leads to the laboratory. The attic has three rooms for servants and a larger room for storage. A paint analysis done in 1994 revealed that the house had no wall paper initially and that the walls and woodwork were painted \\"a brilliant white\\".Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 23. alt=A photograph of the main stairway and hallway of a house, painted white. The house is a frame structure, covered with white wooden clapboards, anchored to a stone foundation. The Priestleys built their home out of wood, dried in trenches on the site, because no stone or brick was available in the area. Joseph wrote a detailed description of the drying process, concluding: \\"A house constructed with such boards I prefer to one of brick and stone\\".Qtd. in Kieft, 8 This may have prompted journalist William Cobbett to caustically label the house a \\"shed\\" in one of his political tirades against Joseph.Hirsch, 30. The central section of the house has a slate gable roof with a railing-enclosed deck. The house has \\"three internal gable end chimneys, one for the main kitchen\\", and one each at the north and south ends of the central section.Greenwood, \\"\\". The house faces the Susquehanna River, and both the front and rear doors are \\"sheltered by a shallow portico\\". A circular carriage drive (originally gravel, now concrete) leads to the front door, which also has a fanlight. There are five windows on the second floor on both the front and rear sides of the house, with a dentil cornice above both sets of windows. The external details on the house also include a \\"frieze board with triglyphs\\". Originally, delightful panoramic views were visible from the home. It was built facing the Susquehanna River so that visitors arriving by boat could be welcomed by the family and because conventional 18th-century aesthetic theory held that countryscapes were more beautiful than townscapes. Priestley built a high wall blocking the view of Northumberland and added a belvedere to the top of his house to more easily survey the landscape.Hirsch, 30, 37. His plantings were \\"a much scaled-down version of the beautiful gardens\\" at Bowood, the estate of his former employer Lord Shelburne.Hirsch, 37. The lack of skilled craftspeople in Northumberland made the construction of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 64. Ownership and museum After the deaths of Mary and Joseph Priestley, Joseph Priestley, Jr. and his wife, Elizabeth Ryland, continued to live in the house until 1811, at which time they emigrated to Britain and sold the home. The house passed through various hands during the 19th century. Judge Seth Chapman purchased the house from Joseph Priestley Jr. on May 13, 1815 for US$6,250 ($ in ). Chapman died on December 4, 1835, and Rev. James Kay, pastor of the Northumberland Unitarian congregation, and his family lived in the house next. James Kay died on September 22, 1847 and his widow probably lived in the house until her October 2, 1850 death. Charles H. Kay, son of James, had purchased the house in 1845, a few years before his parents' deaths.Kieft, 11‚Äì12. In April 1865 Charles Kay's children sold the house to Henry R. Campbell for $2,775 ($ in ). Florence Bingham purchased the house from Campbell for $5,679.53 on January 18, 1868 ($ in ), and Bingham's heirs sold it to T. Hugh Johnson for $2,000 on October 7, 1882 ($ in ). Kate Scott bought the house for $3,000 on April 11, 1888Hirsch, 30; Kieft, 11; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 64. ($ in ). In 1911 the last private resident moved out of the house,Glazer, \\"Extensive Changes Underway at Priestley House\\". and it was sublet to the Pennsylvania Railroad for its workers (a large railroad yard was built in Northumberland at this time). This led to a general decline in the house and its grounds. alt=Photography of a library, showing a hutch with books in it and a table with various items on it. Professor George Gilbert Pond was the first person to make a significant effort to establish a permanent Priestley museum at the Priestley House.Hirsch, 31; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 64. After raising sufficient funds, he managed to purchase the home at auction for $6,000 from Scott's heirs on November 24, 1919 ($ in ). Pond believed that construction of a new railroad line would destroy the house, and so intended to move it to Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University). However, he died on May 20, 1920 before this plan could be enacted; the planned rail line was never built and the house proved too fragile to move. The college established a memorial fund in Pond's honor and retained the house as a museum, although Pond's children did not formally transfer the house to the college until April 14, 1932.Walker, 153‚Äì157. Some restoration of the house was done in the 1920s, and a small, brick building‚Äîintended as a fireproof museum for Priestley's books and scientific apparatus‚Äîwas built on the grounds and dedicated to Pond's memory in 1926.Hirsch, 31; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 65. In 1941 the state legislature tried to have the State Historical Commission administer the house as a museum, but Governor Arthur James vetoed the plan for lack of funding.Snyder. On December 14, 1955, the college donated the house to the borough of Northumberland.Hirsch, 31; Kieft, 13. From 1955 to 1959 the house served as both the borough hall for Northumberland and as a museum. The house proved too costly for the borough to maintain, and was acquired by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1961.Silverman, Joseph Priestley: Catalyst of the Enlightenment \\".Kieft, 13. Eventually, in 1968 the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) began restoring it and in October 1970 the museum was opened to the public.Hirsch, 31; Kieft, 13; Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 65. The renovations included a restoration of the laboratory, a removal of ornamentation added in the Victorian era, a return of doorways to their original locations, and a return of the shutters \\"to their original locations inside the windows\\".Kieft, 14; The main entrance to the house was also moved to the river side (the original front door) from the Priestley Ave. side (the original back door). The PHMC was supported by \\"The Friends of the Joseph Priestley House\\" (FJPH), who help with the visitor center, tours, special events, and outreach, as well as with clerical and museum work.Kieft, i. alt=Sketch for a stamp, which shows the head of an elderly man colored in an orange palette. Between 1998 and 1999 a renovation that was \\"one of the most extensive changes in the homestead's history\\" set out to \\"restore the grounds around the house to exactly the way it was when Priestley lived\\" there. This involved reconstructing exact replicas of the original carriage barn, hog sties, horse stalls, gardens, fences, and even the privy. These structures were based on T. Lambourne's drawings of the house and grounds that had been discovered in 1983, other records, and excavations.Hirsch, 26, 32. Priestley left no written description of his laboratory, but much is known of his experiments and late-18th-century laboratories. Extensive research on the laboratory within the house was completed in 1996, including excavations that revealed two underground ovens, as well as evidence of a primitive fume hood.Hirsch, 31‚Äì32. The 1998 renovations also included work to restore the laboratory to a condition as close to its original state as possible. After Joseph's death, Thomas Cooper sold a collection of some of his friend's apparatus and other personal belongings to Dickinson College in Carlisle,Paul, 19; for a more extensive discussion of the college's holdings, see Peter M. Lukehart, \\"The Early History of the Joseph Priestley collection at Dickinson College\\", Joseph Priestley in America, 1794‚Äì1804. Ed. Peter M. Lukehart. Carlisle, PA: Trout Gallery, Dickinson College (1994). which exhibits it each year when presenting the school's Priestley Award to a scientist who makes \\"discoveries which contribute to the welfare of mankind\\".Joseph Priestley Celebration Paul, 19. The house lost its original furnishings when Joseph Jr. and his family moved back to England. Since it is not known what was originally in the home, it is furnished and decorated with artifacts donated by descendants of the Priestleys and with ones similar to those listed in Priestley's testament of what was lost in the fire at his Birmingham home.Hirsch, 32‚Äì33. A number of items that belonged to Joseph and Mary during their lives both in Britain and America are on display throughout the house, including Joseph's balance scales and microscope.Hirsch, 41. Portraits, prints, maps, charts, and books have been carefully selected to replicate the Priestleys' holdings.Hirsch, 39. A bedroom on the second floor is dedicated to an exploration of the life of an 18th-century woman. On January 12, 1965, the Joseph Priestley House was designated a National Historic Landmark and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on October 15, 1966.\\"Joseph Priestley House National Historic Landmark Summary Listing \\".\\"National Register of Historic Places\\", Reference Number 66000673. On August 1, 1994, the American Chemical Society named it the second National Historic Chemical Landmark; the dedication ceremony was attended by 75 Priestley descendants.Hirsch, 31, 33; Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 20. In 1988, the Northumberland Historic District, including the Priestley House (which it describes as a \\"gem\\" and one of the finest Federal style buildings in central Pennsylvania), was listed on the NRHP. The district includes one other building already on the NRHP: the Priestley-Forsyth Memorial Library, which was built as an inn around 1820 and was owned by a great-grandson of the Priestleys in the 1880s. Today it serves as Northumberland's public library. The Joseph Priestley Memorial Chapel, which is a contributing structure in the historic district, was built in 1834 by his grandson, and is home to a Unitarian Universalist congregation that considers Priestley its founder.Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 21. Under the PHMC, the museum was open ten months a year, closing between early January and early March. In 2007 and 2008 the number of visitors held steady after recent declines.Bashore, 2. According to the PHMC, in fiscal 2007‚Äì08 \\"total visitation ... was 1,705 with a paid visitation of 1,100 generating $4,125 in program revenue and 2,406 recreational and non-ticketed visitors\\".Planning Our Future: Sustainability Committee Final Report The fiscal 2006‚Äì07 operations budget for the house and its two full-time staff was $142,901, with $6,900 (five percent) coming from FJPH and the rest from the state of Pennsylvania. Panoramic view of the interior of Priestley's lab in June, 2009 On March 4, 2009 the PHMC released a report examining its 22 museums and historic sites and recommended discontinuing operations at six, including the Joseph Priestley House. The proposed closure of the Priestley House was based on \\"low visitation and limited potential for growth\\".Dandes.Schulz. Despite public meetings, protest letters, and a general \\"public outcry\\" against closure,Scott.Hoffmann. on August 14, 2009 the state closed the Priestley House and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis.Rujumba. The sole remaining state employee at Priestley House was furloughed. That month the Friends of the Joseph Priestley House submitted a plan to the PHMC to operate the house on weekends from May to October with staffing provided by volunteers. The plan depended both on acquiring insurance for the volunteers, the house, and its contents, and on the state passing a budget.Laepple, \\"State budget impasse closes historic Joseph Priestley House\\". On September 24, 2009 the PHMC and officers of the FJPH signed an agreement to reopen the museum on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The house reopened on October 3, with volunteer staffing from the FJPH. The agreement can be renewed annually and lets FJPH \\"schedule programs, set fees and be in charge of all the business aspects of running the site\\".Laepple, \\"Friends group to reopen Priestley House\\". On November 1, there was a \\"grand reopening celebration\\" at the house with a dozen costumed volunteer guides and chemical demonstrations in Priestley's laboratory.Priestley House Museum to hold re-opening celebration On November 7, 2010 the brick Pond building was rededicated after an $85,000 renovation, as part of the museum's annual \\"Fall Heritage Day\\".Fall Heritage Day planned at Joseph Priestley HouseRovner, 63. The restoration, which had been planned for years,Hirsch, 47. was paid for by private donors and included \\"handicapped accessibility, new roofing, heating and air-conditioning and new interior walls, ceilings and lighting\\". The FJPH plan to install a timeline of Priestley's scientific work and times in the Pond building, as well as a video about his laboratory techniques and impact today. =American Chemical Society= The American Chemical Society (ACS) has used the Joseph Priestley House as a place to mark special celebrations. On July 31 and August 1, 1874, \\"seventy-seven chemists made a pilgrimage to the site to celebrate the centennial of chemistry\\". The date was chosen to mark the hundredth anniversary of Priestley's experiment producing oxygen by heating mercuric oxide with a magnifying lens and sunlight. These chemists came from 15 US states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and England, and their meeting at the house and a local school \\"is now recognized as the first National Chemistry Congress, and many ACS historians believe it led to ACS's formation two years later on April 6, 1876\\". On September 5, 1926, about 500 ACS members met again at the home to dedicate the small brick museum and to celebrate the meeting 50 years earlier (two survivors of that first meeting were present).Hirsch, 30‚Äì31; Kieft, 12‚Äì13; Richardson, \\"Current Interpretation\\", 20. Representatives of the ACS were present at the October 1970 dedication of the house as a museum.Kieft, 14. On April 25, 1974 around 400 chemists from the ACS Middle Atlantic Regional Meeting in Scranton came to visit the home. The Priestley Medal, the highest and oldest honor awarded by the ACS, was awarded to Paul Flory at the house that day. (A replica of the Priestley Medal is on display at the house.) On August 1, 1974‚Äîwhat has been labeled the bicentennial of the discovery of oxygen‚Äîover 500 chemists attending the third Biennial Conference on Chemical Education at State College traveled to the house to celebrate \\"Oxygen Day\\". In October 1976, the ACS celebrated its own centennial with a celebration in Northumberland. A 100-plus piece replica of Priestley's laboratory equipment, made by universities, corporations, and the Smithsonian Institution, was presented to the house for display. On April 13, 1983, ACS President Fred Basolo spoke at the house to celebrate Priestley's 250th birthday and as part of a first day of issue ceremony for the United States Postal Service's Joseph Priestley commemorative stamp.Kieft, 15‚Äì16. In 2001 the ACS again met at the house to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the society, and reenacted parts of the 1874 and 1926 celebrations, including a march to Priestley's grave, at which each participant left a red rose.Richardson, \\"Joseph Priestley's American Home\\", 61, 65.

In July 2016, researchers at the Education Policy Institute found that \\"at primary level the Harris Federation is the highest performing school group in England ‚Äì the improvement it has made is equivalent to pupils making around one and a half times more progress than average\\". In 2017, the Harris Federation was recognised by government league tables as being the top performing multi-academy trust (MAT) in England. Commenting on the new performance data, Schools Standards Minister, Nick Gibb, said that the Harris Federation is \\"leading the way\\" in delivering excellent results for its pupils. In 2018, the Department for Education published a league table comparing the performance of all multi-academy trusts. The Harris Federation was ranked the top performing large trust for the progress made by its pupils and for the progress made by its disadvantaged pupils.https://www.compare- school-performance.service.gov.uk/schools-by- type?step=default&table;=mats&for;=secondary&hasperfdata;=true Social Mobility In 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 research by the Sutton Trust found that the Harris Federation was among \\"The best academy chains (for) having a transformational impact on pupils‚Äô life chances\\".https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/20/academy-chains- underperforming-for-disadvantaged-children-study-finds The Harris Federation runs a cultural enrichment programme that aims to improve outcomes for their brightest students, with activities run with organisations such as LAMDA, the Royal Opera House and Christie's. In summer 2018, the musician Stormzy, who attended a Harris Academy, returned to his old school to launch a scholarship scheme for black students at Cambridge university.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-45206266 In 2014, the Harris Federation and Westminster School opened the Harris Westminster Sixth Form. The aim of the sixth form, which received 1,000 applications for 250 places, is to help students from London's state schools access top universities. In 2019, 37 students from this academy received offers to study at Oxford and Cambridge universities.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on- the-success-of-the-harris-federation-degrees-of-excellence-pkgtjrl0p In 2019, the Harris Federation opened the first completely free nursery in England. With 55 hours of free childcare per week for 51 weeks of the year for children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, the Federation said it \\"had been compelled to provide early years places to the most needy children because they miss out under the existing rules on free nursery places.\\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/academy-chain-to-open-free-nursery- for-poorest-children-mkpbdrhlt Harris Federation academies are the top school for progress in five of the nine boroughs in which the Federation operates and three Harris academies ‚Äì Harris Academy Battersea, Harris Academy Morden and Harris Academy Bromley ‚Äì are in the top 1% of schools in the country for pupil progress. The Harris Federation is the highest performing MAT in the country for pupil progress and EBACC qualifications for disadvantaged students. In 2018, Harris Academy Battersea received an 'Outstanding' rating from Ofsted. Previously known as Battersea Park School and Battersea Technology College, the school became a Harris Academy in 2014 after it was branded inadequate. In one year at the previous school, no pupils gained five or more GCSE passes. In 2003 three percent of children left with five A*-C GCSEs and in 2017 this figure was 83%. The school is now oversubscribed and the percentage of students applying to Russell Group universities has greatly increased. Ofsted said that teachers were proud to work at the academy, that morale was high and pupils of all abilities make \\"very strong progress\\".  Teacher Housing  In 2016, concerned that teachers were being priced out of London because of the cost of accommodation, the Harris Federation launched a campaign for academy trusts to be able to turn unused land on their school sites into affordable housing for teachers. Controversies Some of the schools within the federation were formerly run by local authorities, and forced by central government to become academies as part of the Harris Federation against the wishes of 94% of the parents and boards of governors. There was national media coverage over Downhills Primary School (now Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane), where it was reported that 94% of parents opposed the change to academy status. At the time, the government said it had decided to close Downhills Primary School and re-open it as a Harris Academy because of 'chronic underperformance' at Downhills. According to national news reports, standards of education at Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane quickly improved with the Federation's involvement. Having been in special measures before becoming a Harris academy, its first inspection report after opening found that it was now good with outstanding features. Reacting to the news that the Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane in the heart of Tottenham, had being unduly helping their pupils in their Key Stage 2 Sats tests, anti-academies campaigner Fiona Millar said \\"I‚Äôve scrutinised their data and wondered how they get these results with similar cohorts of pupils. Increasingly we see they do it by this unethical behaviour. \\" Year 6 pupils were given too much help in their English reading and maths reasoning Sats, according to the Standards and Testing Agency (STA). Thus, pupils‚Äô scores in those papers have been expunged and they will receive scores only for their spelling, punctuation and grammar tests. In a letter sent to parents on Monday, 6 August 2018, the academy's chair of governors, described the investigation findings as ‚Äúdeeply regrettable and disappointing‚Äù. However, the school was inspected by Ofsted after this and rated Outstanding, with the schools inspectorate judging that \\"The academy trust worked swiftly to investigate the maladministration of standardised tests and took appropriate disciplinary action. They have ably managed the school by brokering highly skilled leaders to provide the school with renewed focus and direction.\\"https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/21/138447 In 2018, the second primary school run by this academy chain had SATs results annulled. The Standards and Testing Agency cancelled some of the results of former year six pupils at Harris Primary Academy Kent House over fears of ‚Äúmaladministration‚Äù. In 2013 Roke Primary School joined the Harris Federation, against the wishes of some parents and governors who did not want to have academy status. Now known as Harris Primary Academy Kenley, the academy has since been judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted. As part of a local awards scheme, the Principal of the academy was nominated as a 'Croydon Hero' because of the improvements that took place. The Harris Westminster Sixth Form, which was scheduled to open in 2014, has been criticised for costing ¬£45 million of public money to establish. Before it opened, the former chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge, called it a \\"vanity project\\". However, Ofsted inspected the Sixth Form in autumn 2016, rated it \\"outstanding\\" in all areas and praised it for creating \\"a community of scholars\\". Its first set of A Levels were described as \\"outstanding\\" by The Times, which reported that \\"almost a third\\" of pupils \\"cannot afford to pay for school meals, but they achieved 12% A* grades and 42% A% to A grades\\". In 2015 it was reported that Harris Academies had some of the highest turnover of staff amongst schools in the UK, with the Guardian reporting that over a third of Harris teachers leave after just one year, with 1,000 teachers leaving the Federation in three academic years, underlined by 34 leaving Harris Falconwood in 2015 alone. The Anti-Academies Alliance put this high turnover down to poor working conditions, excessive workload and unreasonable pressure on teachers from senior leadership. In 2019 numerous Harris Academies were accused of 'gaming' the system through the practice of entering entire cohorts for the ESOL qualification, which is aimed at students who have English as an additional language (EAL), Harris Falconwood entered the whole of their Year 11 cohort (177 students) despite only having 15 EAL students. This was shown to be common practice across the Federation. .https://schoolsweek.co.uk/harris- schools-swamp-esol-exam-with-native-english-speakers/ =Challenging Ofsted= Harris educates about 25% of London school children, and considers itself experiences in increasing the social mobility of children of low income families. It has identified that these children do better with shorter Key Stage 3, and a three-year exam orientated Key stage 4. more colloquially this is spoken of as 'three years to do their GCSE'. Ofsted recognises that their GCSE result are outstanding but believes that the students are losing out on the wider Keystage 3 experience. Ofsted warned Harris, that schools that used the two plus thee method would lose their '√ìutstanding status'. Harris instructed its 27 secondary academies to switch back to the three plus two model in July 2019. In many schools, this will have accommodation and staffing cost and they may not transition until September 2020. In January 2020, Martyn Oliver, chief executive of Outwood Grange Academies Trust, told the Times that \\"New Ofsted inspections favour middle-class kids\\". Inspectors, fighting against schools who just teach to the test are take a far too simplistic a view on when GCSE teaching should begin. Many of the children in Outwood Grange Academies Trust schools need a three-year run up.‚ÄúThey don't have books at home and space for homework. All that has to happen in school time and disproportionately their life chances come from qualifications.‚Äù Moynihan backed him up, ‚ÄúFor many of our children qualifications are all they have in their hands at a job interview or college application and beyond. They have no networks, no contacts, no professional people in their family to help them on in life. Their GCSEs are crucial. Ofsted is valuing curriculum over qualifications. Ofsted denies that the have produced a middle class framework for Middle class kids, or that it has a view on two year key-stage three but it is the milage travelled not the length of the course that was being judged. =Remuneration debate= In 2017‚Äì18, the salary of the CEO of the Harris Federation was in the ¬£440-450,000 bracket which is higher than any other multi-academy trust.https://schoolsweek.co.uk/no-pay-rise-for-highest-paid- academy-chief-for-the-first-time-in-six-years/ References External links *Harris Federation *Dashboard of Harris Academy locations Category:Educational charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Founders of English schools and colleges ","title":"Harris Federation"},{"id":"11885125","text":"Irene Ighodaro (16 May 1916 ‚Äì 29 November 1995) was a Creole from Sierra Leone physician and social reformer who was the first Sierra Leonean woman to qualify as a medical doctor.

It is a hard maltose candy with sesame and ginger flavours. The sweet is made by first melting maltose, then adding to it various ingredients and continuously stirring the mixture. Before the mixture solidifies, it is put on a metal stick and pulled into a line shape, then coiled into the shape of a plate. In Cantonese, deuk means chiselling, breaking things into pieces. When street hawkers sold the candy, it was necessary for them to break apart its original shape with a pair of flat chisels, namely \\"deuk\\". Chiselling makes noise and attracts children to buy. Deuk Deuk Tong was thus named (T√≥ng means \\"candy\\" in Cantonese). Today, in order to cater to young people's tastes, different flavours of Deuk Deuk Tong are also made, including coconut, chocolate, mango, banana, and strawberry flavours.

Hays served multiple terms in the Virginia House of Delegates and one term as in the U.S. House of Representatives in a district that was eliminated as Virginia lost residents. Early and family life Hays was born in Harrison County near Clarksburg in what later became the state of West Virginia. He married Roanna Arnold in 1817. Following Roanna's death in 1841, Hays married twice more: first to Nancy Covert (died 1863) and then to Emma Fletcher. Career Hays moved to what was then Lewis County (later Gilmer County) to farm in 1833. Lewis County voters (and at times those in adjoining Braxton County and later Gilmer County) elected Hays many times to represent them (part-time) in the Virginia House of Delegates. Hays was elected as a Democrat to the 27th United States Congress, serving from 1841 to 1843, and made an unsuccessful bid for reelection in an adjoining district in 1842 when Virginia lost a congressman in as a result of losing population in the 1840 census. However, Hays again won election to the Virginia House of Delegates, this time representing Braxton and Lewis Counties. During his Congressional term, Hays sponsored the admission of Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson as a cadet to the military academy at West Point, and also urged the building of the Parkersburg-Staunton Turnpike. He laid out the town of Glenville in 1845. Hays, Joseph Smith, John S. Carlile and Thomas Bland also represented Randolph, Lewis, Barbour, Gilmer, Braxton, Wirt and Jackson counties as their delegates to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850, which gave more representation to the western counties. In 1857, Hays moved to Sauk Rapids, Minnesota Territory. President James Buchanan, a fellow Democrat, had appointed him Receiver of Public Moneys and Hays continued as such until Buchanan's presidency ended in 1860, at which time Hays resumed farming near what was then the administrative center of the new state of Minnesota. Death and legacy Hays died in 1871 and was interred at the Old Benton County Cemetery in Sauk Rapids.

Career counseling is a type of advice- giving and support provided by career counselors to their clients, to help the clients manage their journey through life, learning and work changes (career). This includes career exploration, making career choices, managing career changes, lifelong career development and dealing with other career-related issues. There is no agreed definition of career counseling worldwide, mainly due to conceptual, cultural and linguistic differences. However, the terminology of 'career counseling' typically denotes a professional intervention which is conducted either one-on-one or in a small group. Career counseling is related to other types of counseling (e.g. marriage or clinical counseling). What unites all types of professional counseling is the role of practitioners, who combine giving advice on their topic of expertise with counseling techniques that support clients in making complex decisions and facing difficult situations. Terminology There is considerable variation in the terminology that is used worldwide to describe this activity. In addition to the linguistic variation between US English (counseling) and British English (counselling), there are also a range of alternate terms which are in common use. These include: career guidance; career coaching; guidance counselling; personal guidance; career consulting and a range of related terminologies. This frequently leads writers and commentators to combine multiple terms e.g. career guidance and counselling to be inclusive. However, care should be exercised when moving from one terminology to another as each term has its own history and cultural significance. An alternate term is 'career guidance'. This term is sometimes used as a synonym for career counselling, but can also be used to describe a broader range of interventions beyond one-to-one counselling.  History and new approaches  Career counselling has a long history going back to at least as far as the late nineteenth century. An important defining work for the field was Frank Parsons' Choosing a Vocation which was published in 1909. Parsons was strongly rooted in the American progressive social reform movement, but as the field developed it moved away from this origin and became increasingly understood as a branch of counselling psychology. While until the 1970s a strongly normative approach was characterised for theories (e.g. of Donald E. Super's life-span approach) and practice of career counseling (e.g. concept of matching), new models have their starting point in the individual needs and transferable skills of the clients while managing biographical breaks and discontinuities. Career development is no longer viewed as a linear process which reflects a predictable world of work. More consideration is now placed on nonlinear, chance and unplanned influences. This change of perspective is evident in the constructivist and social constructionist paradigms for career counselling. The constructivist/social constructionist paradigms are applied as narrative career counseling that emphasizes personal stories and the meaning individuals generate in relation to their education and work. Postmodern career counselling is a reflective process of assisting clients in creating self through writing and revising biographical narratives taking place in a context of multiple choice from a diversity of options and constraints. The shift moves from emphasizing career choice to empowering self-affirmation and improving decision making.Peavy, R. V. (1996). Constructivist career counselling and assessment. Guidance & Counselling, 11(3), 8-14. Recently this approach is widely applied in Australia such as in Athlete Career and Education (ACE) program by Australian Sports Commission and Scope for artists by Ausdance. While career counselling has its origins in the USA and the English speaking world it has now spread to become a worldwide activity that can be found to some extent in all countries.  Related professional activities  Career counseling includes a wide variety of professional activities which help people deal with career-related challenges. Career counselors work with adolescents seeking to explore career options, experienced professionals contemplating a career change, parents who want to return to the world of work after taking time to raise their child, or people seeking employment. Career counselling is also offered in various settings, including in groups and individually, in person or by means of digital communication. Several approaches have been undertaken to systemize the variety of professional activities related to career guidance and counseling. In the most recent attempt, the Network for Innovation in Career Guidance and Counselling in Europe (NICE) ‚Äì a consortium of 45 European institutions of higher education in the field of career counseling ‚Äì has agreed on a system of professional roles for guidance counselors. Each of these five roles is seen as an important facet of the career guidance and counselling profession. Career counselors performing in any of these roles are expected to behave professionally, e.g. by following ethical standards in their practice. The NICE Professional Roles (NPR) are: *Career educators \\"suppor[t] people in developing their own career management competences\\" *Career information and assessment experts \\"suppor[t] people in assessing their personal characteristics and needs, then connecting them with the labour market and education systems\\" *Career counsellors \\"suppor[t] individuals in understanding their situations, so as to work through issues towards solutions\\" *Programme and service managers \\"ensur[e] the quality and delivery of career guidance and counselling organisations' services\\" *Social systems intervener and developers \\"suppor[t] clients (even) in crisis and works to change systems for the better\\" The description of the NICE professional roles (NPR) draws on a variety of prior models to define the central activities and competences of guidance counselors. The NPR can, therefore, be understood as a state-of-the- art framework which includes all relevant aspects of career counselling. For this reason, other models haven't been included here so far. Models which are reflected in the NPR include: * BEQU: \\"Kompetenzprofil f√ºr Beratende\\" (Germany, 2011) * CEDEFOP \\"Practitioner Competences\\" (2009) * ENTO: \\"National Occupational Standards for Advice and Guidance\\" (Great Britain, 2006) * IAEVG: \\"International Competences for Educational and Vocational Guidance\\" (2003) * Savickas, M.: \\"Career Counselling\\" (USA, 2011) Benefits and challenges = Benefits = Empirical research attests the effectiveness of career counseling. Professional career counselors can support people with career- related challenges. Through their expertise in career development and labor markets, they can put a person's qualifications, experience, strengths and weakness in a broad perspective while also considering their desired salary, personal hobbies and interests, location, job market and educational possibilities. Through their counseling and teaching abilities, career counselors can additionally support people in gaining a better understanding of what really matters for them personally, how they can plan their careers autonomously, or help them in making tough decisions and getting through times of crisis. Finally, career counselors are often capable of supporting their clients in finding suitable placements/ jobs, in working out conflicts with their employers, or finding the support of other helpful services. It is due to these various benefits of career counseling that policy makers in many countries publicly fund guidance services. For example, the European Union understands career guidance and counseling as an instrument to effectively combat social exclusion and increase citizens' employability. = Challenges = One of the major challenges associated with career counseling is encouraging participants to engage in the process. For example, in the UK 70% of people under 14 say they have had no careers advice while 45% of people over 14 have had no or very poor/limited advice. In a related issue some client groups tend to reject the interventions made by professional career counselors preferring to rely on the advice of peers or superiors within their own profession. Jackson et al. found that 44% of doctors in training felt that senior members of their own profession were best placed to give careers advice.Jackson et al, Informing choices: the need for career advice in medical training Furthermore, it is recognised that the giving of career advice is something that is widely spread through a range of formal and informal roles. In addition to career counselors it is also common for psychologists, teachers, managers, trainers and Human Resources (HR) specialists to give formal support in career choices. Similarly it is also common for people to seek informal support from friends and family around their career choices and to bypass career professionals altogether. In the 2010s, increasingly people rely on career web portals to seek advice on resume writing and handling interviews and to do research on various professions and companies. It has also possible to get a vocational assessment done online.  Training  There is no international standard qualification for professional career counselors, although various certificates are offered nationally and internationally (e.g. by professional associations). The number of degree programs in career guidance and/or career counseling is growing worldwide. The title \\"career counselor\\" is unregulated, unlike engineers or psychologists whose professional titles are legally protected. At the same time, policy makers agree that the competence of career counselors is one of the most important factors in ensuring that people receive high quality support in dealing with their career questions. Depending on the country of their education, career counselors may have a variety of academic backgrounds: In Europe, for instance, degrees in (vocational/ industrial/ organization) psychology and educational sciences are among the most common, but backgrounds in sociology, public administration and other sciences are also frequent. At the same time, many training programs for career counselors are becoming increasingly multidisciplinary.  Professional career guidance centers  There are career guidance and counseling centers all over the world that give advice on higher studies, possibilities, chances and nature of courses and institutes. There are also services providing online counseling to people about their career or conducting psychometric tests to determine the person's aptitude and interests.  Career assessment  Assessment tools used in career counseling to help clients make realistic career decisions. These tools generally fall into three categories: interest inventories, personality inventories, and aptitude tests. Interest inventories are usually based on the premise that if you have similar interests to people in an occupation who like their job, you will probably like that occupation also. Thus, interest inventories may suggest occupations that the client has not thought of and which have a good chance of being something that the client will be happy with. The most common interest inventory is a measure of vocational interests across six domains: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional. People often report a mixture of these domains, usually with one predominant domain. Aptitude tests can predict with good odds whether a particular person will be able to be successful in a particular occupation. For example, a student who wants to be a physicist is unlikely to succeed if he cannot do the math. An aptitude test will tell him if he is likely to do well in advanced math, which is necessary for physics. There are also aptitude tests which can predict success or failure in many different occupations. Personality inventories are sometimes used to help people with career choice. The use of these inventories for this purpose is questionable, because in any occupation there are people with many different personalities. A popular personality inventory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It is based on Carl Jung‚Äôs theory of personality, but Jung never approved it. According to Jung most people fall in the middle of each scale, but the MBTI ignores this and puts everyone in a type category. For example, according to the MBTI, everyone is either an extrovert or an introvert. According to Jung, most people are somewhere in between, and people at the extremes are rare. The validity of the MBTI for career choice is highly questionable.  In the United States  In the United States, the designation, \\"career counselor\\" is not legally protected; that is, anyone can call themselves a career counselor. However, CACREP, the accrediting body for counselor education programs requires that these programmes include one course in career counseling as a part of the coursework for a masters in counseling. The National Career Development Association (NCDA), the credentialing body for career counselors, provides various certifications for qualified career counselors. For those university-trained counselors or psychologists who have devoted a certain number of years to career counseling and taken specific coursework, it offers a Master Career Counselor (MCC) credential. The National Career Development Association is the only professional association of career counselors in the United States that provides certification in career counseling. In Australia  In Australia, career counselling may be provided by professionals from various disciplines (e.g., psychology, education, guidance, and counselling). The Professional Standards for Australian Career Development Practitioners provide guidelines about appropriate qualifications and competencies for career counselling. There are a range of postgraduate degrees (e.g., Master, Doctor) that are endorsed for career development practice according to the Professional Standards. The Career Industry Council of Australia (CICA) endorses career development programs in Australia. There are other relevant qualifications but these may necessarily not be endorsed under the provisions of the Professional Standards by CICA. A Diploma of Counselling and a Certificate IV in Career Development are offered at TAFE colleges and other registered training organisations throughout Australia.  In India  In India, career counselling is a vast area of professional service driven by factors like huge talent availability in the country and huge higher education network comprising Graduation, Post Graduation and multiple professional courses. Leading bodies in India that drive policy level initiatives for students and working professionals are: Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), https://mhrd.gov.in/ University Grants Commission (UGC),https://www.ugc.ac.in/ All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) https://nsdcindia.org/ among others.

It is within the diocese of Ely. Its population was estimated at 110 in 2001. At the 2011 census the population had fallen to fewer than 100. Nearby villages include Boxworth, Conington, Elsworth and the expanding new settlement of Cambourne. History The place-name 'Knapwell' is first attested in an Anglo-Saxon will of 1043-5, where it appears as Cnapwelle. It was referred to as Cnapenwelle in 1060, and was listed as Chenepewelle in the Domesday Book of 1086, when it was held by the Abbot of Ramsey. The name means 'Cnapa's well or stream'. 'Cnapa' may be the Old English cnapa meaning boy or servant, so the name might mean 'boy's well'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.281. It seems likely that Knapwell is named after the chalybeate Red Well in the wood just to the east of the village. The well was the only source of water for both the village and neighbouring Boxworth. Its waters were known for their medicinal properties. A mound to the north-east of the church is believed to be the motte of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. It would have been a small fortification, probably with a timber superstructure, and perhaps dating from The Anarchy under King Stephen. The village's manor house was established in Norman times, between the church and the motte, and traces of a building and moat remain in the wood (Overhall Grove) to the east of the church. Church The village has had a church, dating back to at least 1180. A church, dedicated to All Saints, was probably built in the early 14th century. The medieval church had a long, low chancel and a three-bay aisled nave, all under a single roof, and a west tower. In 1864 the medieval church was demolished, except for the tower, and rebuilt in a plain Gothic style. The original 14th-century tower is built of field stones dressed with limestone and is unbuttressed. The Knapwell elm trees Knapwell was once celebrated for its many ancient pollarded Field Elms, which marked the old boundaries, closes and lanes of the larger medieval village and which were locally called \\"the Dodds\\".Mabey, R. The Flowering of Britain, Hutchinson, 1980,p.97Rackham, Oliver Trees and Woodland in the British Landscape,Dent, 1976, p.1171 The trees grew both in the fields immediately bordering the main street and amongst the houses of the modern village. The name may have derived from \\"dodderel\\", a dialect word for a pollard. The trees succumbed to Dutch Elm Disease in the 1980s. Overhall Grove (not to be confused with Knapwell Wood) has a notably large number of surviving elm trees. Village life The village has no shops or pubs, though was home to the Three Horseshoes pub until its closure in 1880. The local primary school is Elsworth CE(A) Primary School in Elsworth.

It stars Dedee Pfeiffer, Teri Garr, Howard Hesseman, and Eric Close. Plot 28-year-old Emily Hall (Dedee Pfeiffer) is a bright and talented - but frustrated - novelist whose book constantly gets rejected by publishers. Her life goes into a tailspin when her boyfriend, Mike (Eric Close), breaks up with her; her best friend, Amber (Laura Leighton), suddenly packs up and moves to Mexico; and her psychic mother, Mona (Teri Garr), surprises her with the overwhelming news that her supposedly dead father is really an errant hippie photographer named Yogi (Howard Hesseman), who has just arrived in town and wants to meet her. Unable to get a decent job, surrounded by the success of her friends and further depressed by the approach of her 10-year high school reunion, Emily must confront the reality that she has fallen far short of the lofty goals to which she originally aspired. Her world continues in its downward spiral as she finds herself crossing paths with an ever-increasing variety of unusually eccentric people ranging from a chain-smoking Santa Claus (Chris Elliott) to an obnoxious literary agent (Sean Astin). Faced with the problem-laden reality of her unsuccessful life, Emily lets her imagination take her down the road of wacky and ineffectual ways to kill herself. But, before she can find an acceptable form of suicide, (no pain, no gore, no guts allowed), Emily finds herself thrown into a volunteer job at a local hospital where, with her faithful dog Sam, she visits sick and terminally ill patients. One such patient, the ever-negative Mr. Finch (Bert Remsen), seems to dislike Emily & Sam's constant intrusions into his solitary life, but with time and devotion Emily helps Mr. Finch to see the beauty and value in the world around him. Their new-found relationship proves to be the turning point for Emily, and, with Mr. Finch's help and support, Emily's faith in her own talent is restored.

The president is responsible for both the Chilean government and state administration.See Sentencia Rol 78-1989 of the Constitutional Court of Chile, relapsed on the Central Bank of Chile's Constitutional Act project (declarations N¬∫ 7 to 13). Although its role and significance has changed over the history of Chile, as well as its position and relations with other actors in the national political organization, it is one of the most prominent political figures. It is also considered as one of the institutions that make up the \\"Historic Constitution of Chile\\", and is essential to the country's political stability. Under the current Constitution (adopted in 1980), the president serves a four-year term, with immediate re-election being prohibited. The shorter period (previously the term was six years) allows for parliamentary and presidential elections to be synchronized. The official seat of the president of Chile is the La Moneda Palace in the capital Santiago. Since 2018, Sebastian Pi√±era is the current president. He won the 2017 Chilean general election and assumed the office on 11 March 2018 for the second term. Previously, he held the position for the first term from 11 March 2010 - 2014. Features of the office =Requirements= The Constitution of 1980 and its 2005 amendment establishes the requirements for becoming president. The president must be a natural-born citizen of the country, or else born overseas when one of his or her parents or grandparents is a Chilean national. The president must also be at least 35 years old. In addition, all the requirements for becoming a Senator apply. The president must meet all the requirements to qualify as a fully Chilean citizen with the right to vote: they must have reached the age of eighteen years and have never been sentenced to severe punishment, nor lost the right to vote on grounds of insanity, been tried for a crime attracting severe punishment or for terrorist conduct, or condemned by the Constitutional Court under Article 8 of the Constitution. =Election= Article 26 detail the electoral requirements. The president shall be elected by direct ballot, with an absolute majority of the votes validly cast. A two-round system is used. In order to win the election in the first round, the winning candidate's party must receive more than 50 percent of the valid votes leaving out of the count blank and spoiled votes. The election shall be held the third Sunday of November of the year immediately before the end of the administration of the president then holding office. Should there be more than two candidates in the presidential election, none of them obtaining more than half of the votes validly cast, a new election shall be held. The second election (\\"balloting\\"), in the manner determined by law, shall be held the fourth Sunday after the first election, limited to the two candidates with the highest relative majorities. Then, the candidate with the majority of valid votes in that round is elected president. =Term duration= Under the 1828 constitution, the president served for four years, without the possibility of immediate reelection for one more term. In 1833, the presidential period was changed to five years, with a possibility of immediate reelection for one more term, limited to two consecutive terms. Then by a constitutional reform in 1878, possibility for reelection became disallowed. Under the 1925 constitution, the president served for a six-year term, without the possibility of immediate reelection only. In the original text of the 1980 constitution, the president served for an eight-year term without the possibility of immediate reelection. Some transitory disposals, fixed during the government of the general Augusto Pinochet, allowed the exceptional possibility of his reelection in the 1988 plebiscite. Then, in the transition to democracy the 1989 referendum established a first transitional four-year presidential term (1990‚Äì1994), followed by common eight-year terms, without the possibility of immediate reelection. However, in 4 March 1994 (a week before Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle took office) the presidential period was reduced to a six-year term, without an immediate reelection. Under the 2005 constitutional reform, the president serves for four years without the possibility of immediate reelection for one more term. A former president may run for office once again after serving their initial term, but only in an election following their successor, as it is not allowed to run for consecutive terms. There is no limit to how many times a person can run for candidacy if they have not previously served as president. The incumbent president, in accordance with the constitution, completes their corresponding term on 11 March of the immediate year after the election. The president-elect takes office the same day. =Presidential symbols= Presidential sash President Sebastian Pi√±era receives the presidential sash from Senate President Jorge Pizarro at the National Congress of Chile on 11 March 2010. President Michelle Bachelet with presidential sash and the O'Higgins Pioche, 11 March 2014 President Sebastian Pi√±era receives presidential sash and the O'Higgins Pioche for the second time, 11 March 2018 The presidential sash, used initially by Bernardo O'Higgins, became a symbol of the authority of the first president with the assumption of office by President Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto in 1831. It is composed of three stripes with the colors of the Chilean flag, it is sewn by hand and measured approximately 75 cm long and 13 cm wide. From the nineteenth century a single sash was maintained that was transferred from president to president until 1915, due to the height differences between the outgoing Ram√≥n Barros Luco and the elected Juan Luis Sanfuentes, so a new sash had to be designed. Since that date, each president has had his or her own presidential sash, which is used only in official ceremonies. O'Higgins Pioche The O'Higgins Pioche, which is considered the symbol of presidential power and is placed at the lower end of the presidential sash, is a star of five ends of about 7 cm in diameter, enameled in red. It dates back to the medals of the Legion of Merit and remained intact until the coup d'etat of 1973, when it disappeared during the bombing of the La Moneda palace. During the military regime of Augusto Pinochet a replica of the pioche was created, based on photographs of the original. It is only used together with the presidential sash. Ford Galaxie presidential car Ford Galaxie 500 The ceremonial presidential vehicle in Chile is a 1966 black Ford Galaxie XL Convertible, given as a gift by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on her visit to Chile. It is used only for official ceremonies celebrating national days on 21 May, 18 and 19 September, and presidential inaugurations which take place on 11 March every four years. It has a normal license plate (EL-2801). =Succession= In the case when the president is unable to perform his/her duties, his/her powers are usually temporarily transferred to the Minister of the Interior under the title of \\"vice president\\"; however this is not a true vice presidential position, but rather a position of a designated acting president. If the president and minister of the Interior are both temporarily unavailable, the next minister of the government, in the order of succession, becomes the \\"vice president\\".

Khamisiyah is under the administration of the province of Dhi Qar. The area contains a few small towns, including Khamisiyah and Sahalat, with an estimated population of 8,500. It is probably most noted for the Khamisiyah Ammunition Storage Facility (also known as Tel Al Lahm Ammunition Storage Facility) built and used during the regime of Saddam Hussein. Persian Gulf War The Khamisiya Ammunition Storage Facility was a site approximately 25 square kilometres in area and consisted of two sections: one of 88 warehouses; the other of 100 hardened concrete bunkers surrounded by an earth berm and security fencing. The storage complex was in use by 1982. In March 1991, combat engineers and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) teams of the U.S. Army, conducted a demolition operation. The entire storage complex, containing massive quantities of munitions, was set to be destroyed. On 4 March, all explosive charges were detonated, and witnesses stated that the resultant explosion yielded an impressive mushroom cloud. It has not been confirmed how this explosion affected Iraqi civilians in the area, if at all. It was not known at the time, but destruction of ordnance at Khamisiya is thought to have consequently released nerve agents such as sarin and cyclosarin into the atmosphere. Computer-generated models based on atmospheric conditions project that clouds of nerve agents would have drifted south and reached allied troops. Records also show that Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) sensors monitoring the air soon reported traces of nerve agents. These NBC detection units were military units of several allied countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Poland. =Aftermath= It was unclear for a long time whether or not there had been chemical weapons at Khamisiya, partly because of an alternate name used by the Iraqi military (Tal al Lahm), and partly because there were other munitions storage locations in the area, including Talil Air Base and in the nearby town of An Nasiriyah. By 1996, it became clear to the Department of Defense that nerve agents were present at the Khamisiya storage facilities. In April 2002, the United States Department of Defense released two reports related to operations at Khamisiyah during the Gulf War. The first report is a final version of its case narrative U.S. Demolition Operations at Khamisiyah. The second was a technical report detailing the modeling and risk characterization of possible chemical-warfare- agent exposure in the Gulf War. Some Gulf War veterans that were in the area have reported symptoms that meet the definitions of Gulf War Syndrome, while others report no symptoms. The U.S. Department of Defense is continuing investigations or is funding independent studies, has kept up attempts to keep track of veterans and monitor changes in personal status, as well as informing veterans and the public of any research-related progress. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs continues to treat veterans who report symptoms related to or resembling Gulf War Syndrome.

(1997) The Gate City: A History of Omaha. University of Nebraska Press. p. 180 When he was young, Dennison traveled throughout the West as a prospector, saloon-keeper, gambler and robber. Dennison had owned and operated gambling houses such as the Opera House Gambling Saloon in Leadville, Colorado and the Board of Trade saloon in Butte, Montana.Leighton, G.R. (1939) Five Cities: The Story of Their Youth and Old Age. Ayer Publishing. p. 194 Arrival in Omaha Tom Dennison was thirty-four when he arrived in Omaha with $75,000 in cash.Menard, O.D. (1989) Political Bossism in Mid America: Tom Dennison's Omaha, 1900‚Äì1933. University Press of America. p. 11. Upon surveying the city, he found Omaha to be a \\"wide open town\\", meaning there was little legal control over gambling, liquor, prostitution and other criminal interests.Leighton, G.R. (1939) p. 194 Dennison soon became known as the city's \\"King Gambler\\" and first entered the political arena around 1900 as a way of protecting his interests. Dennison never actually held public office, instead buying influence through lavish campaign contributions and his ability to get out the vote.Beerman, B.J. (2004) Where the hell is Omaha? AmericanMafia.Com Dennison acted as a power broker between the business community and the local vice lords. His gambling operations were mainly located in Omaha's third ward. He actively worked with local temperance groups to eliminate half of the saloons in Omaha ‚Äî reputedly, the half he didn't control. Dennison operated a private bank at 1409 Douglas Street, the site of the current Union Pacific Center, loaning money and providing a discreet repository for those who shunned traditional banks.Camp, L.S. (2001) When Clerks Of The District Court Had Real Power: Robert Smith's Omaha, 1908-1950 . Nebraska Lawyer. April. p. 18. Retrieved 6/21/07. For more than 25 years, his power was such that no crime occurred in the city without his blessing, the police reported to him daily, and the mayor himself answered directly to him. Dennison once explained his law theory to the Omaha Bee, saying, \\"There are so many laws that people are either law breakers or hypocrites. For my part, I hate a damn hypocrite.\\"Camp, L.S. (2001) p. 18. Early in 1918 Dennison was the subject of a sensational trial. During the proceedings, Dennison himself admitted that one of his \\"roadhouses\\" operated for more than 10 years without a license. He explained he was making side payments to a county commissioner for \\"protection from the law.\\"Willbourne, S. (1999) \\"1919 Riots\\". Nebraska Lawyer. Retrieved 6/21/07. Dennison controlled Omaha politics throughout his reign. His approval to run for office was gained through payment of bribes and by supporting the rest of Dennison's political slate. In 1906, Omaha Republicans supporting the Progressive Movement nominated a reformer named Erastus Benson for Mayor, and Dennison was afraid that Benson would come out in favor of prohibition. Omaha Democrats nominated James C. \\"Cowboy Jim\\" Dahlman, a popular, first-time candidate. Dahlman seemed to be more tolerant of Dennison's \\"Sporting District\\", so Dennison supported him. Dahlman was elected mayor that year, and in eight out of nine subsequent campaigns for mayor between 1906 and 1930; Dahlman's losing the election in 1918 was part of the background to racial violence in Omaha. Lynching of Will Brown In 1916 Nebraska passed a state constitutional amendment allowing for prohibition,Larsen, L. and Cottrell, B. (1997) p. 183 and in the late 1910s, Dennison's political power waned. Omahans, fed up with Dennison's corrupt style, voted in Edward Parsons Smith, a reform-minded candidate committed to \\"cleaning up Omaha\\", as mayor in 1918.Davies, P. (2003) American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age. Owl Books. p. 104. Boss Dennison nursed a grudge against Mayor Smith that is ultimately attributed with leading to the Omaha Race Riot of 1919. That year the Omaha Bee newspaper, founded by Edward Rosewater in the previous century, luridly reported on fictitious assaults on white women by black men. Each new story questioned Mayor Smith's ability to run the city.Partsch, F. (2006) \\"Harvey Newbranch and the 1919 Omaha Courthouse Riot\\". Nebraska Humanities X. p. 10. This, along with economic conditions facing recent veterans returning from World War I, led to increased racial tension throughout Omaha. On September 28, 1919 a white mob launched a riot resulting in the brutal lynching death of African American civilian Will Brown, the death of two white rioters, the injuries of many Omaha Police Department officers and civilians (including the attempted hanging of Mayor Smith), and a public rampage that included the burning of the Douglas County Courthouse in downtown Omaha.(1994) A Street of Dreams. (Video) Nebraska Public Television. The systematic carnage in Omaha ended a day later, after 1,700 federal troops from nearby Fort Omaha and Fort Crook came to the city which restored order and peace throughout the area. Police compiled a list of 300 alleged participants, with Dennison's \\"right-hand man\\" Milton Hoffman high on the list. Hoffman was accused of leading the mob from South Omaha to the Douglas County Courthouse and whipping them into a frenzy. Dennison got Hoffman out of the city before he could be arrested.(nd) \\"Who Was to Blame?\\" NebraskaStudies.org. Retrieved 6/21/07. In the trials that followed, a turncoat from Dennison's machine said he had heard Boss Dennison boasting that some of the assailants were white Dennison operatives disguised in blackface. This was corroborated by police reports that one white attacker was still wearing the make-up when apprehended. As in many other Dennison-related cases, no one was ever found guilty for their participation in the riot.Partsch, F. (2006) p. 10. A later grand jury hearing corroborated this claim, stating \\"Several reported assaults on white women had actually been perpetrated by whites in blackface.\\" They went on to report that the riot was planned and begun by \\"the vice element of the city.\\" The riot \\"was not a casual affair; it was premeditated and planned by those secret and invisible forces that today are fighting you and the men who represent good government.\\" Prohibition era During the 1920s, the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act effectively ended the mainstream distribution of alcohol in Omaha and across the United States. Early in this period Dennison formed the Omaha Liquor Syndicate to monopolize the bootleg liquor trade in Omaha. Dennison also developed alliances with Al Capone in Chicago and Tom Pendergast in Kansas City. This led to violence among the city's bootleggers, culminating in the 1931 murder of Harry Lapidus, a local businessman and outspoken opponent of the Dennison machine. Police never solved the murder of Lapidus; however, in the wake of the murder public opinion turned against Dennison. It was during this time that Dennison most strongly exerted his influence in state politics. After vigorously opposing a plan to have a single election commissioner law for Omaha, in the 1920s Dennison also fought against statewide plan, leading state legislators to back off from their plan until after his death.Harris, J.P. (1960) Election Administration in the United States. Brookings Institution. p. 111. Dennison was also strongly in control of the city's political element; a survey in 1929 found more than 1,500 outlets in the city selling alcohol. A campaign by state officials, including several raids, drove several establishments underground; however, Dennison encouraged the transformation of the industry, leading saloons to become cocktail lounges and taverns. Because of him, Omaha remained a \\"boisterous town\\". During this period it was said that there was no crime that happened in the city without Dennison knowing about it beforehand. Dennison maintained several offices around downtown Omaha, connecting them by tunnels. His influence over the mayor helped Dennison install family members in city jobs all over Omaha. In this same time frame Dennison also ran Omaha's Flatiron Building at 1722 St. Mary's Avenue as a refuge for mobsters running from the law in Kansas City, Chicago and St. Louis.Palmer, J. (2006) \\"Omaha's Hidden History\\" Omaha World- Herald. 9/3/06. Retrieved 6/21/07. Final years In June 1932 Dennison suffered, and recovered from, a paralytic stroke. In August of that year Dennison and 58 of his associates went on trial for conspiracy to violate the Volstead Act. Tom Dennison was indicted in the liquor conspiracy case; however, the trial resulted in a hung jury and was declared a mistrial.(2007) \\"History at a Glance\\" , Douglas County Historical Society. p 90. Retrieved 5/13/08. That December he nearly died from pneumonia. In August 1933, Dennison was divorced by his 20-year-old wife, Neva Jo Truman Dennison. The political ticket Dennison was running was defeated in elections throughout Omaha later that year. Dennison and his associates were acquitted of conspiracy in January 1934. The following month, while visiting associates near Chula Vista, California in February, 1934, he was fatally injured in an auto accident. Dennison was 75. His funeral on February 20, 1934 at St. Peter's Catholic Church in Omaha was attended by more than a thousand people, reportedly representing Omaha's business, official and sporting interests. One hundred eight cars made up the procession to Forest Lawn Cemetery.
