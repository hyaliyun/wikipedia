Reasons for reissue =New audio formats= Recordings originally released in an audio format that has become technologically or commercially obsolete are reissued in new formats. For example, thousands of original vinyl albums have been reissued on CDs since introduction of that format in the early 1980s. More recently, many albums originally released on CD or earlier formats have been reissued on SACD or DVD-Audio. =Budget records= Beginning with Pickwick Records, which acquired the rights to reissue many of Capitol Records' non-current albums at a low price in venues other than record stores, several record companies started \\"budget\\" or \\"drugstore records\\" subsidiaries to sell their deleted items at lower prices. =New ownership= When one record label buys out another record label or acquires an individual recording artist's back catalogue, their albums are often reissued on the purchasing label. For example, Polydor Records reissued many of James Brown's albums which were originally released on his former label, King Records. King Records had itself previously reissued albums and singles by Brown that were originally recorded for its subsidiary label, Federal Records. =Strong or weak sales= Recordings are reissued to meet continuing demand for an album that continues to be popular after its original release. In other cases, albums are reissued to create interest in and hopefully revive the sales of a release which has sold poorly. For example, the heavy metal label Roadrunner Records is notorious for reissuing their artist's works' only months after releasing the original album. According to US music magazine Billboard, reissues target \\"casual consumers who hadn't picked up the album when it was originally released, as well as obsessives who need to own every song in an artist's catalog.\\" In the late 2000s to early 2010s, reissues of studio albums with expanded track listings were common, with the new music often being released as stand-alone EPs. In October 2010, a Vanity Fair article regarding the trend noted reissues and post-album EPs as \\"the next step in extending albums' shelf lives, following the \\"deluxe\\" editions that populated stores during the past few holiday seasons‚Äîadd a few tracks to the back end of an album and release one of them to radio, slap on a new coat of paint, and‚Äîvoila!‚Äîa stocking stuffer is born.\\" Examples of such releases include Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster (2009) following her debut album The Fame (2008), and Kesha's Cannibal (2010) following her debut album Animal (2010). =Special, Limited and Commemorative Editions= Some recordings are reissued to celebrate their popularity, influence, or an anniversary of the artist or the recording. =Track controversy and revisionism= Some recordings are reissued soon after their original release because one of the tracks was seen in a negative light. \\"Cop Killer\\" by Body Count was one such example. Some recordings are remixed and reissued in an effort to erase prior band member's contributions. Two such examples were Ozzy Osbourne‚Äôs Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman. British girl group Sugababes reissued two of their studio albums in a similar manner; Taller in More Ways following Mutya Buena's replacement with Amelle Berrabah, and Sweet 7 after Keisha Buchanan's replacement with Jade Ewen. = Sequel = Some reissued albums were released for making sequel of the promotion project. This is different to special or limited album, where both special and limited album were released for certain event like Christmas or group's anniversary. An example is Funky Town by T-ara, where this repackage album was released as the sequel of their previous EP, Black Eyes. The album was released for their drama video project where the video was released as the sequel of their previous drama video, Cry Cry from the previous EP. Another example is Twicecoaster: Lane 2 by Twice. The repackage album is the sequel of their previous EP, Twicecoaster: Lane 1 Alterations Common additions to reissued albums include: * Audio remastering * Inclusion of bonus tracks or multimedia content * New liner notes * New album art or packaging * Modifiers in the title such as \\"Special Edition\\" or \\"Expanded Version\\" Reissues and certification For the purposes of quantifying sales, an album's original and subsequent releases are counted together. For example, if an album sold 300,000 of its original release and 700,000 in subsequent reissues, it would be entitled to platinum certification. However, the musical contents of the original disc must remain the same on a reissue for it to count towards certification. Reissue labels Some record labels specialize in reissuing recordings originally released on other labels. Three of the biggest reissue labels are Rhino Records, Hip-O Records, and Legacy Recordings. Each of these companies reissues material from the labels of a major music conglomerate: Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony BMG, respectively. Collectables Records is another prolific reissue label that licenses recordings from other labels.

Because KBER AM was a daytime only station, its country music programming continued on KBER-FM into the night. In 1974, KBER-AM-FM were sold to Pacific Western Broadcasting. The call signs were changed to KQAM for the AM station and KSAQ for the FM station, also known as \\"Q-100.\\" The two simulcast a Top 40 format. In 1976, the AM station was sold to a Spanish-language broadcaster, while the FM station was sold to Radio Alamo. Radio Alamo switched the call letters to KZZY, initially keeping the Top 40 sound. But then it briefly tried a country format as KCCW. The country music lasted less than a year. =Klassy 100= In 1981, Radio Alamo flipped the format to adult contemporary music.Broadcasting Yearbook 1985 page B-271 Radio Alamo also acquired AM 930 in Terrell Hills (now KLUP) and simulcast both stations, as KLLS and KLLS-FM, \\"Klassy 100 FM.\\" In 1987, Newcity Communications acquired AM 680 and FM 100.3.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1988 page B-282 =Country KCYY= 680 KKYX had been owned by Swanson Communications, running a classic country format.

Another country station was 107.5 KBUC-FM, but its ratings weren't a factor, and it eventually flipped to Tejano KXTN-FM. Newcity thought there were enough country fans in San Antonio for two healthy FM country outlets. KCYY premiered by playing 10,000 songs in a row with no commercials. Backed by the commercial-free weeks and TV ads, KCYY became San Antonio's top country station in Spring 1988.Radio & Records Ratings Report, Fall '88, page 173 KCYY was also the top station in the 18-49 year old demographic and the 25-54 demographic, according to the Arbitron ratings.

Smooth jazz music can be heard on 101.9 HD-2 (HD Radio needed). Regional Mexican music can be heard on 101.9 HD-3 (HD Radio needed) and FM translator K289BN 105.7 FM. History For most of its existence, KQXT was known as EZ listening or adult contemporary \\"KQ-102\\". The station began in 1967 as KCOR-FM with its antenna at the sister KCOR AM towers at Abe Lincoln road in North West San Antonio. KCOR AM was an established Spanish-language station, going back to 1946. The FM was always separate from the AM. The station was sold (with KCOR) in 1975 to Harbenito Radio (later known as Tichenor Media) along with KCOR (AM). The FM moved from Abe Lincoln road to the Tower of the Americas site in downtown San Antonio in 1970. It was sold to Westinghouse' Group W Broadcasting in 1984. In 1990, KQXT moved away from their longtime \\"Elevator Music\\" image to a more mainstream AC playlist with the new slogan, \\"Continuous Soft Favorites\\" and was re-branded as \\"KQ-102\\". The station achieved great success in the early 1990s and, at one point was the top adult station in San Antonio. It was acquired by Clear Channel Communications in 1993 in a deal that involved other local stations. In 2000, KQXT was re- branded as \\"Soft Rock 101.9\\" in an effort to move to a more contemporary AC playlist. On January 2, 2007 the station underwent another change and is now known as \\"Q101.9\\". The format remains intact with the addition of more rhythmic songs. As with most iHeartMedia-owned adult contemporary stations and non-iHeart-owned adult contemporary stations like KKMJ-FM in Austin, KQXT devotes the month leading to Christmas to playing continuous holiday music.

He is featured in every game in the series, including as a player character in most of them. The character's critical reception was mostly positive as one of the more realistic ninja characters in video gaming and one of the earliest stealth game heroes. Character design Rikimaru was originally motion capture-portrayed by Sho Kosugi, a Japanese actor made famous by starring in a series of American ninja films in the early 1980s, whose son Kane Kosugi portrayed Rikimaru's nemesis Onikage. Rikimaru's characteristics include unusually white hair and a scar over his right eye yet maintaining the stereotypical hoodless ninja outfit including his long sleeved fishnet top under a vest, with baggy trousers and traditional ninja boots, while carrying a legendary sword named Izayoi granted to him by his master and mentor, Shiunsai. Compared to his female partner Ayame, Rikimaru's design did not change much through the series, with exception of the first sequel which featured the younger version of him and with no scar. Appearances Rikimaru is the current head of the Azuma Shinobi Ninja Clan and the series' primary protagonist. His master and predecessor as head of the clan was Shiunsai, who was killed by another member of the clan, Tatsumaru. Dedicated, honourable and withdrawn, Rikimaru is prepared to sacrifice his own life without hesitation,Tenchu 2 PlayStation manual, page 4. something he does at the end of Tenchu: Stealth Assassins only to reappear in Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven. His ability to retain his composure and sense of destiny allows him to undertake missions others would consider suicidal. He lacks speed in combat when compared to Ayame, but has greater strength and a greater control over his temper than his female companion. His primary rival in the series is Onikage, whom he fights in almost every game and usually defeats, only to have him coming back again due to his resurrection abilities and intense desire to defeat Rikimaru. Years before the events of the games, Shiunsai received an order to assassinate a particular samurai. Together with several fellow ninja, he infiltrated the home of the samurai and killed him. As he and the other ninja were preparing to leave, the dead samurai's wife and servant discovered the ninja. The others quickly dispatched the wife and servant, but as they moved to silence the baby clutched in the dead wife's arms, Shiunsai stopped them from killing the baby boy. Taking pity on the boy, Shiunsai brought the baby home with him and raised it as if it were his own flesh and blood. Shiunsai was already raising Tatsumaru to become a ninja and he decided that the new baby would follow the same path. After the baby had grown into a young boy and started his training as a ninja, it became apparent that he was something of a weakling. Rikimaru's personality was different before the events of Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins. He believed that he was already good enough to defeat any opponent and his misplaced self-confidence would eventually earn him many painful experiences once he finally left his village, but those experiences would also be the source of great mental and spiritual growth. Rikimaru had bonds with two other ninja: Shiunsai and Tatsumaru. Both were very important to him, and both were lost. Shiunsai was a father figure to him, but Rikimaru showed only his student connection to Shiunsai, while Tatsumaru was like his older brother and role model. Suffering from a memory loss, Tatsumaru kills Shiunsai. Upon the recovery of his memory, he kills himself. This event marked the death of Rikimaru's former personality. Upon his master's death, Rikimaru takes the role of leader of the Azuma Ninja Clan at the age of 18. Rikimaru wields the ancient sword Izayoi, which is passed on through the generations from leader to leader. Rikimaru took possession of the sword during the war with the Burning Dawn. Ayame defeated Tatsumaru, who had previously wielded Izayoi, and gave it to Rikimaru, effectively turning over leadership of the clan to him. Izayoi does have certain magical properties, and is also extremely strong and resilient to injury. The only time it has ever been damaged was during Rikimaru's duel with Dr. Kimaira in Wrath of Heaven, and it was promptly repaired by the clan's blacksmith, Ressai. When Tatsumaru killed Master Shiunsai, Rikimaru let his feelings take over and pursued the murderer. A fierce fight between the two took place, but eventually gaining the upper hand, Rikimaru hesitated. Tatsumaru takes that time to cut his right eye, leaving him scarred for life. Tatsumaru used to be Rikimaru's role model, but by now, Rikimaru has surpassed him in his spiritual and physical abilities. By the time of Tenchu Z, the Azuma Ninja Clan was reduced to being made up of only two ninja left: Rikimaru and Ayame, who treats Rikimaru only as a companion. Even though both of them show loyalty and respect towards each other, not much compassion is felt between them. In Tenchu Z, the Ninja MasterTenchu Z Xbox 360 manual, page 3. Rikimaru decides to train the next generation of Azuma Ninja and sends his newest ninja (the player's character and a companion of his choosing) to complete missions assigned to help the town of Gohda. He trained two young disciples before the events of the game, Kagemaru (male) and Shinobu (female). (Whatever the sex of the character the player chooses, the other new ninja will still die during the course of events.)

From 1965 to 1990, he taught at the University of Rochester, New York, retiring as the Joseph C. Wilson Professor of History Emeritus. Life and career Zagorin was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 29, 1920, to Solomon Novitz and Mildred Ginsburg Zagorin. He married the artist Honor√© Desmond Sharrer on May 29, 1947. They had one son, Adam Zagorin, who currently works for Time Magazine and has two sons of his own.Obituary, Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/05/24/AR2009052402804.html Zagorin's B.A. was from the University of Chicago; he earned both his M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1947 and 1952 respectively.Directory of American Scholars, 10th Ed., Vol 1, 559; see also Who's Who, sv Perez Zagorin. At Harvard, Zagorin was a student of Wilbur Kitchener Jordan, Charles McIlwain and others.Court, Country and Culture, viii. He taught history at Amherst College (1947-1949), at Vassar College (1951-1953), and reached the rank of full Professor at McGill University, Montreal, while teaching there (1955-1965). The move to Canada resulted in part because of difficulties he encountered finding a tenure-track position in the U.S.A. because of his political beliefs, as McCarthyism threatened academic freedom.Oral history interview with Perez Zagorin, 2007 Jan. 17-18  work=Archives of American Art  publisher=Smithsonian Institution  url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-perez- zagorin-13600 He then returned to the U.S., teaching briefly at Johns Hopkins University, before joining the faculty at the University of Rochester, New York, in 1965, subsequently chairing the History Department (1967-1969). He then held the Joseph P. Wilson Professorship of History (1982) until his retirement in 1990. From 1992 until his death, Zagorin was a research Fellow of the Edgar F. Shannon Center for Advanced Studies at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. He held fellowships at several other distinguished institutions, including the Folger Shakespeare Library, Guggenheim Fellowship, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and the Royal Historical Society of Great Britain.A brief recap of his career, including a partial list of academic awards, can be found in Court, Country and Culture, xvi-xvii, which also includes a list of his publications to date, 249-ff. Early work His revised dissertation became his first major publication, A History of Political Thought in the English Revolution.London: Routledge & Paul, 1954. His second monograph, The Court and the Country: the Beginning of the English Revolution (1969), explored the origins of the English Revolution by examining the split in the English governing class. He then moved to consider the nature of early modern revolution itself, publishing a European- wide comparative survey of his results in two volumes, Rebels and Rulers 1500-1600 (1982), a study of early modern European revolutions in particular, and especially differentiating them from the modern exemplar, the French Revolution. His next work Ways of Lying (1990) was in effect a counterpart study that looked at the effects on individuals as early modern states demanded various forms of loyalty oaths, often in pursuit of religious uniformity, and the emergence of counter-theories about the practice and acceptability of resisting such demands‚Äîthe roots of the American notion of the right against self-incrimination. Later work Zagorin then produced a series of monographs on particular participants in the troubles of 17th- century England, first Milton: Aristocrat & Rebel (1992), looking at the political beliefs of the poet John Milton. Next was Francis Bacon (1999), about the English philosopher and courtier, Sir Francis Bacon, that explored the dissonance between the soaring ideals of Bacon's philosophical ambitions and his life as courtier, politician, and lawyer serving in government. A final monograph on Thomas Hobbes, Hobbes and the Law of Nature, was published posthumously in 2009. Zagorin's last survey work, How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West (2003), returned to questions regarding individual belief ranged against those who claimed the right to enforce religious conformity by force if necessary, tracing the emergence of a particular and contested view of a right to freedom of conscience. It arose out of the religious conflicts of the 17th century, and informed the views of the American founders. In 2005 Zagorin published Thucydides: An Introduction for the Common Reader (2005), a non-specialist work on Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War. Zagorin argues the work is more than a mere chronicle of the conflict between Athens and Sparta, being also a story of politics, decision-making, the uses of power, and the human and communal experience of war. In his view the work remains of permanent interest because of the exceptional intellect that Thucydides brought to the writing of history, and to the originality and intensity of vision that inform his narrative.

It bemoans the plight of the Irish emigrants who so longed for home from their new lives in America. This song is sung by a man who longs for his home in Spancill Hill, County Clare, his friends and the love he left there. All the characters and places in this song are real. History Spancil Hill is located in County Clare, Ireland, just outside Ennis on the road to Tulla. Spancil Hill Fair is one of the oldest horse fairs in Ireland. It is held annually on 23 June. Spancil refers to the practice of \\"spancilling,\\" which was to use a short rope to tie an animal's left fore-leg to its right hind leg, thereby hobbling the animal and stopping it from wandering too far. Michael Considine of Spancilhill was born about 1850. In 1851, after the Great Famine, there were fewer than 20 houses, so its population was not recorded separately from the townland, whose total population had fallen from 278 in 46 houses to 174 in 34. Considine emigrated to the United States of America around 1870. He left intending to make enough money to send for his sweetheart so they could be married. Her name was Mary MacNamara, and she is mentioned in the song as ‚ÄòMack the Ranger's daughter‚Äô. Considine worked in Boston for two years or so before moving to California. In failing health, he wrote the poem in memory of the hometown he would not live to see again, and posted it to his young nephew in Ireland.\\"Singer whose 'Spancil Hill' was hailed as finest version\\", Irish Times, 29 December 2012. Michael Considine died in California in 1873 at the age of twenty-three. The rendition of the late singer/songwriter Robbie McMahon, who died in 2012 at the age of eighty-six, is widely regarded as the definitive version of Spancil Hill. The best known version of the song is that sung by the Dubliners and Christy Moore, which is highly abbreviated and makes a number of changes to the lyrics ‚Äì for example renaming the protagonist \\"Johnny\\" instead of \\"Mike\\", and describing his love as daughter of a farmer instead of the local ranger. Lyrics The below version is the one sung by Robert McMahon which is considered to be closest to Michael Considine's original poem. :Spancilhill :Last night as I lay dreaming, of the pleasant days gone by, :My mind being bent on rambling and to Erin's Isle I did fly. :I stepped on board a vision and sailed out with a will, :Till I gladly came to anchor at the Cross of Spancilhill. :Enchanted by the novelty, delighted with the scenes, :Where in my early childhood, I often times have been. :I thought I heard a murmur, I think I hear it still, :'Tis that little stream of water at the Cross of Spancilhill. :And to amuse my fancy, I lay upon the ground, :Where all my school companions, in crowds assembled 'round. :Some have grown to manhood, while more their graves did fill, :Oh I thought we were all young again, at the Cross of Spancilhill. :It being on a Sabbath morning, I thought I heard a bell, :O'er hills and vallies sounded, in notes that seemed to tell, :That Father Dan was coming, his duty to fulfill, :At the parish church of Clooney, just one mile from Spancilhill. :And when our duty did commence, we all knelt down in prayer, :In hopes for to be ready, to climb the Golden Stair. :And when back home returning, we danced with right good will, :To Martin Moylan's music, at the Cross of Spancilhill. :It being on the twenty third of June, the day before the fair, :Sure Erin's sons and daughters, they all assembled there. :The young, the old, the stout and the bold, they came to sport and kill, :What a curious combination, at the Fair of Spancilhill. :I went into my old home, as every stone can tell, :The old boreen was just the same, and the apple tree over the well, :I miss my sister Ellen, my brothers Pat and Bill, :Sure I only met my strange faces at my home in Spancilhill. :I called to see my neighbors, to hear what they might say, :The old were getting feeble, and the young ones turning grey. :I met with tailor Quigley, he's as brave as ever still, :Sure he always made my breeches when I lived in Spancilhill. :I paid a flying visit, to my first and only love, :She's as pure as any lilly, and as gentle as a dove. :She threw her arms around me, saying Mike I love you still, :She is Mack the Ranger's daughter, the Pride of Spancilhill. :I thought I stooped to kiss her, as I did in days of yore, :Says she Mike you're only joking, as you often were before, :The cock crew on the roost again, he crew both loud and shrill, :And I awoke in California, far far from Spancilhill. :But when my vision faded, the tears came in my eyes, :In hope to see that dear old spot, some day before I die. :May the Joyous King of Angels, His Choicest Blessings spill, :On that Glorious spot of Nature, the Cross of Spancilhill.

The county existed from 1855 to 1895. The county seat was at St. James on Beaver Island.  Before 1855: islands attached to mainland counties  Before the 1836 Treaty of Washington extinguished Native American claim to most of the land in the northwest part of Northern Michigan, the islands were nominally a part of Michilimackinac County (later renamed Mackinac County). In 1840, that portion of Mackinac County lying in the lower peninsula was divided into counties that remained attached for administrative purposes to Mackinac. The Manitou Islands were a part of Leelanau County, while the Beaver Island group was a part of Tonedagana County (quickly renamed Emmet County). In 1853 county government was organized in Emmet County and the administrative attachment of Leelanau County was changed to Grand Traverse County, Michigan. In 1847, James J. Strang, a leader in the Latter Day Saint movement, established a colony on Beaver Island. Strang crowned himself king of his church in 1850, and he was also elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in the 1853 and again in 1855. Due in large part to fear of and animosity towards Strang's religious sect, and concerns over the political strength his following gave him, petitions were presented to the legislature to detach Beaver and the Fox Islands from Emmet and form them into a separate county. This was granted in 1855. The Manitou Islands were included in the new county and gave it their name, despite being nearly unpopulated at the time. 1855-1895: organization of the county  In 1855 the Manitou Islands were organized as Chandler Township and the Fox Islands as Galilee Township, while the Beaver Islands became Peaine Township. The northern tip of Peaine Township later became St. James Township. \\"King Strang\\" was assassinated in 1856, and in what historian Byron M. Cutcheon would call the \\"most disgraceful day in Michigan history\\", Strang's nearly 2,600 Latter Day Saint subjects were driven forcibly from Beaver Island by non-Mormons.Weeks, Robert P. (June 1970).\\"For His Was the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory...Briefly\\". American Heritage 21 (4). With the Mormon population gone, the civil government of Manitou County was abandoned and Manitou was attached in 1861 to Mackinac County. In 1865, the attachment was changed to Leelanau County, which had organized in 1863. The attachment was switched back to Mackinac in 1869.  After 1895: islands reattached to mainland counties  The first attempt to disestablish Manitou County occurred in January 1877, when retiring governor John J. Bagley urged the Legislature to do so: ‚ÄúI submit herewith petitions and correspondence relative to the affairs in the county of Manitou. They show that the laws of the State and the United States are violated with impunity, and that there is no safety or protection to persons or property in portions of this county. No courts have been held for years. The county offices are vacant a large portion of the time, there is no jail, debts cannot be collected by process of law, nor are any of the forms of law complied with. I recommend the county organization be discontinued and the territory be attached to the county of Charlevoix.‚Äù No action was taken at the time, but when the issue came up again in 1895, the Legislature agreed and made the Beaver Islands part of Charlevoix County and the Manitou and Fox Islands part of Leelanau County. At the time of its extinction, the population of Manitou county was 917, with a total of 177 on the Manitou and Fox Islands, and 740 on the Beaver Islands. South Manitou Island became part of Glen Arbor Township, North Manitou was made part of Leland Township, and the Fox Islands were made part of Leelanau Township. The two Beaver Island townships still remain in existence.

His name appears in several spellings, including La Ramee, Laram√©e, LaRam√©e, La Ramie, La Rami, La Remy, and Laramie. La Ram√©e is credited as an early explorer of what is now called the Laramie River of Wyoming and Colorado. The city of Laramie, Wyoming, with an Americanized spelling, was later named for him. Early life Jacques La Ram√©e was born on June 8, 1784, in Qu√©bec, British Canada, to Joseph Fissiau dit Laram√©e and Jeanne Mondou. He has been described as M√©tis, or French-First Nation. Volume VI of the North West Company registry cites two Laram√©e brothers, Jacques and Joseph. A variant of the name La Ram√©e was first documented in the western United States in 1798, referring to a canoe man who worked until 1804. This may have been Francois Laram√©e, who is also listed in the registry of the NW company. This La Ram√©e had several sons, who ventured west into Wyoming and Idaho. According to Joachim Fromhold, one of the sons was Jacques La Rami, for whom the Laramie River is named. Jacques La Ram√©e organized a group of independent, free trappers, who set out in 1815 for the headwaters of the North Platte River in the United States Unorganized Territory of present-day Wyoming Fur trader and explorer According to historian C. G. Coutant, Jacques La Ram√©e worked as a voyageur and fur trader for the North West Company and John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. Employees of the North West Company and its rival, the Hudson's Bay Company, were in competition, and disputes at times turned violent. In 1821 the two feuding companies merged. La Ram√©e was known for his character and peaceful reputation. He organized a group of independent trappers, who set out, in 1815, for the headwaters of the North Platte River, in the United States Unorganized Territory of present-day Wyoming. Coutant writes that La Ram√©e and his band of trappers befriended many Native American tribes who would trade pelts to them for European goods. This enterprise established the free trapper rendezvous in Wyoming, where trappers represented themselves without middle-men or an umbrella company. According to journalist Jim McKee (citing Robert Stuart from 1812), free trappers would rendezvous each May on the Oregon Trail pathway along the shore of the North Platte River. La Ram√©e was a leader and considered the trappers' spokesperson. He assigned trapping areas among the free traders. LaRam√©e's rendezvous In 1815, La Ram√©e organized a free-trapper rendezvous at the junction of the North Platte and what is now named the Laramie rivers. Later fur trading companies held annual rendezvous here. For five years these events attracted more trappers and traders, and a trade market was established, in addition to routes to and from supply depots. In May, following the rendezvous, traders would arrange for transport of the pelts to Saint Louis, Missouri on bullboats via the Missouri river. Supplies were returned by keelboat or bullboat. La Ram√©e distributed supplies to the free trappers, and assigned their geographic trapping area for the coming season. Death La Ram√©e was known to have set off in 1820 to trap along what is now known as the Laramie River and its tributaries. He was never seen alive again. When he did not show up for the rendezvous, organizers initiated a search for him. Speculation on his disappearance and death vary. It was said that he slipped on ice and fell into the Laramie River; or that his body was found in a small cabin; or that he was found \\"stuffed under a beaver dam\\"; or that he was killed by rival trappers or traders, and thrown into the Laramie River. An alleged eyewitness account, from Pierre Lesperance, said that La Ram√©e's camp was attacked by Arapaho warriors, which the people vigorously denied. Legacy Several geographic sites in Wyoming were named for La Ram√©e (anglicized to Laramie), including the Laramie River, the city of Laramie, Fort Laramie, Laramie Peak, and Laramie County. In popular culture James A. Michener's 1974 historical novel, Centennial featured \\"Pasquinel\\", a French M√©tis coureur des bois from Montreal. He was portrayed as an early frontier mountain man and trapper in 1795 Colorado, then part of the Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory of Mexico. NBC television produced a mini-series adaptation of the same name, airing it in 1978-1979. Pasquinel was portrayed by American TV actor, Robert Conrad. Pasquinel is believed to be loosely based on La Ramee.

As a child, he was nicknamed \\"Gringo\\", because of his pale skin, and the artistic name \\"Guinga\\" comes from the way he pronounced the word.  Biography  His uncle taught him to play the guitar when he was eleven years old. Guinga began composing music at the age of 14. In 1967, when he was 17, his song \\"Sou S√≥ Solid√£o\\" reached the first eliminatory round in Rede Globo's second Festival Internacional da Can√ß√£o (International Festival of Song). At the age of 26, he began his five-year classical guitar studies with Jodacil Damasceno. During the 1970s, Guinga accompanied famous singers such as Beth Carvalho and Jo√£o Nogueira and recorded with samba legends Cartola and Clara Nunes. He also began a fertile songwriting partnership with the poet and lyricist Paulo Cesar Pinheiro. Their songs were recorded by important artists like Elis Regina, Nelson Gon√ßalves, Mi√∫cha, Clara Nunes, and Michel Legrand. During the same time, Guinga embarked on a parallel career in dentistry, which he practiced for nearly thirty years. His music career took off in earnest in 1990, when Ivan Lins and Vitor Martins formed the Velas label in order to release Guinga's first album, with a repertoire of songs he co-authored with lyricist Aldir Blanc. Guinga is known for his songwriting and his skill on the guitar. He is known for drawing on many musical genres, including choro, samba, bai√£o, frevo, modinha, waltz, foxtrot, blues, classical music, and jazz. His compositions are often harmonically and rhythmically complex, while being melodic.

The water is over 60 feet deep near the center of the bridge. The bridge is maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation. Originally conceived in the 1930s, planning work on the bridge began in earnest in 1950, and construction began in 1954. Four workers were killed in construction accidents on the bridge. The Norris Bridge is long, and provides a Mean High Water clearance of under the center span. Prior to the placement of the current traffic safety barrier, in its 50+ years there are two known fatal accidents involving cars flipping off the bridge into the water below. When first opened, the bridge was crossed by just over 1,000 vehicles per day, on average. The tolls were removed from the bridge in 1976, and by 1978 the average daily traffic had risen to over 2,500 vehicles per day.

(died 818)Regino of Pr√ºm refers to a Murmanus rex Brittonum (\\"Murman, king of the Bretons\\") who died in 837, but Regino's chronology is notoriously wrong. was a Breton chieftain who was declared king (rex) after the death of the Bretons' Frankish overlord Charlemagne in 814. He is the first person known by name to be described as a Breton \\"king\\". He probably ruled a warband with members drawn from throughout Brittany.Smith, 73-74 and 116. He had a stronghold defended by ditches, hedges and marshes.Smith, 21 n54. Morman had been a faithful follower of Charlemagne, having sworn oaths to him and performed the giving of hands, probably becoming his vassus, although the Bretons rose up in rebellion in 811.Smith, 68 and n34. Morman's rebellion against Frankish lordship in 814 threatened the integrity of Charlemagne's empire, recently inherited by Louis the Pious. While the Bretons may have viewed the elevation of Morman as king on the death of Charlemagne as legitimate, the Frankish writers Astronomus and Ermold the Black saw it as a usurpation.Smith, 65. Louis sent Abbot Witchar to negotiate with Morman. According to Ermold, the abbot asked, \\"Do you not remember your sworn fealty, or your right hand to the Franks / often given, and to Charles the service you showed?\\"Smith, 65 and 68 n34 (\\"Non memorat jurata fides, seu dextera Francis / Saepe data, et Carolo servitia exhibita?\\"). After failing to bring Morman to accept Frankish rule through diplomacy, Louis prepared to invade Brittany. In the spring of 818, Louis's army, composed of forces from all the Frankish regna (literally \\"kingdoms\\", but actually subkingdoms), assembled at Vannes, the westernmost point of actual Frankish control, and marched to Priziac in the far west of the county of the Vannetais on the bank of the river Ell√©. The Franks launched a series of attacks on various Breton fortresses. After Morman was killed in battle, resistance collapsed. According to the Chronicle of Moissac, Louis returned with a \\"triumph of victory\\", although the Bretons revolted again in 822 under Wihomarc.Smith, 66. Notes References *Smith, Julia M. H.

Yamaha produced the road going two-stroke motorcycle, loosely based on the TZ250 Yamaha racing bike. Parallel-twin, reverse cylinder and finally 90¬∞ V-twin variants were produced. It evolved as a natural replacement for the popular RD 250/Yamaha RD350LC series of the 1980s. It has the Yamaha Power Valve System 'YPVS' which raises and lowers the exhaust port depending on the rpm of the engine. The YPVS servo motor starts to open at about 6,000rpm. In standard form it produced 45 hp due to the restrictive standard exhausts and ignition boxes. Racing The TZR250 was still raced in the Yamaha Past Masters race series with the British racing club (BMCRC) as of 2018. Racing engines are currently claiming about at 11,000 rpm. Racing fuel ratios typically 1:30. Standard exhausts are difficult to improve on in terms of power and torque, but they are very large and impede ground clearance. Jolly Moto (Italian after market exhaust maker) exhausts are popular replacements as they are lighter, produce similar performance while improving ground clearance. An F3 racing kit was produced for a few years which included ignition boxes, carbs and exhaust, helping increase maximum revs, power and torque. History Production started in June 1986. At a cost of around $6,000 new on release it was seen as an expensive bike for a 250cc, but given that places such as Japan, Italy and Australia had 250 licensing laws in place one can imagine the stir that something that could hassle 750s on a track caused. The parallel twin 2MA variant being the UK variant and the 1KT model being the domestic Japanese model that were also fitted with a more restrictive CDI to comply with Japanese laws which stipulated an upper limit of 45 hp for 250cc motorcycles. Variations between these two models being minimal, e.g. wording on the brake master cylinder in English or Japanese. Lighting arrangements were also different, to comply with UK type approval regulations, particularly the indicators were mounted on stalks rather than faired into the bodywork. In 1989, the parallel twin reverse cylinder version, 3MA arrived (3MA1). In 1990 the 3MA version received upside-down forks as well as a different shaped expansion chamber for more mid-range power at the expense of a bit of top-end power (3MA3). Then in 1991-1996 the V-twins 3XV. The 3XV came out in 8 variants with different carbs, ignitions, wet & dry clutches, three versions of power valves, cylinders and each depicted by different colour number boards on the side panels and front fairing. The versions names being 250R; 250RS; 250RSP; 250SP and 250SPR. The variants closely followed the configuration of motor of the racing TZ250 of the time, sharing the same engine casings, frames and in some models the cylinders, carbs and power valves.

The Club has had some well-known players come to play for them in the past. Some include Ole Mortensen and English Internationals, Devon Malcolm and Wilf Slack. The home-grown legends include Bill \\"Chook\\" Fowler, Martin Pringle and current 1st class Umpire Barry Frost. Ellerslie Cricket Club has 9 Senior Men's sides and 1 Ladies side and a roster of over 150 junior players. The club's mascot is the great racehorse Bonecrusher (known as the Pride of Ellerslie). The club colours are Black and Gold. The playing season is from October to March. The clubrooms are located above the YMCA on Michaels Avenue and are shared with Ellerslie Soccer Club.  Current  Until the 2005/2006 season Ellerslie's first team played in the First Grade of the Auckland Cricket Club Competition. As a part of restructuring of the Auckland Club Cricket, Ellerslie first grade team merged with Auckland University Cricket Club's first grade and collectively had two teams playing in Premier and Premier Reserve Grade respectively. This merge of Ellerslie first grade with Auckland University's first grade was for a 4-year lock in period. Ellerslie now has stand alone sides in both the Premier and Premier Reserve grades.  Junior cricket  Over the years Ellerslie has always suffered from a moving population which made it hard to gain junior cricketers and keep them through to senior level. Going by photo's taken of teams in the 1920s the club had real strength and again in the 1950s. In the 70's a new influx of youth joined the club as it was critical by ACA rules that all clubs must foster junior cricket. It is usually left up to a few keen parents to ensure the kids are looked after and coached properly and the club has been lucky to have them. People like Roy Schnauer, John Molesworth, Dave Cosgrove, Harold Butler, Wayne Young and many more were assisted by regular club members over the years. During the 90's Kevin Williams took over the mantel and has run the Junior section without fault. He has raised the junior membership to figures never realised in the past and has gained sponsorship for all teams. As a result of all his hard work the club is now seeing the youth moving into the grades and staying with the club. Also the Junior Club has never had so many reps in both the district squads and playing for Auckland, this can only be a plus for the club in the future.  Ladies cricket  Like junior cricket it has always been a tough assignment to get a Ladies Team to be associated with the club but with winning comes recognition and in the early 80's Ellerslie gained a ready made team from ALHA made up of some very good cricketers including past NZ & Auckland reps. This team played in the top Auckland grade and were very competitive as well as a lot of fun in the social aspect of the club with the guitar playing evenings etc. The current plays in the Women's First grade. They have won the championship in 2004/2005 season. In 2005/2006 season they came close but lost in the final which saw them being placed second.  Jubilees  Ellerslie Cricket Club has celebrated two anniversaries over the past 20 years: the 60th in 1982 and 75th in 1997. Both occasions were special for the club bringing past members together and talking over past times and exploits. Probably the most celebrated occasion was in 1982 when the Auckland Racing Club named a race after the club and the winner's photo is still displayed in the clubrooms. The 75th was also a special night with past members coming from as far a field as Australia and The South Island.  Representatives  Over the years the club has had its share of players making representative level. The following are/were the rep players from Ellerslie (Apologies if anyone or the teams they have played in are missed): * Kevin Williams: Club legend and former Wellington rugby player * Shona Gilchrist: Auckland and New Zealand * Rob McKinlay: Auckland and New Zealand Under 20 * Sean Tracey: Auckland and New Zealand * Martin Pringle: Auckland and New Zealand A * Bill Fowler: Auckland * Martin Bradley: Auckland * Emily Drumm: Auckland and New Zealand. * Dean Bartlett: New Zealand Under 19 and Auckland Aces There were also many others who made grade rep teams for Auckland over the years.  Club professionals  When Ellerslie Cricket Club made the premiership grade they decided they needed a boost in player strength and coaching so it was decided to draw on the English County Professionals to help the club. The following is a list of the players (and a profile on their ability) who have graced the Ellerslie Club: * Wilf Slack, Left Hand Batsman & Medium Pace Bowler. Wilf played for Middlesex and England. * Ian Gould, Right Hand Batsman and Wicket keeper. Ian played for Middlesex, Auckland & England. *Harry \\"Bhuna\\" Bliss: English Club player and future international hopeful. * Iain Anderson, Right hand Batsman. Iain played for Derbyshire. * Ole Mortensen, Fast Right Arm Bowler. Ole played for Derbyshire & Denmark. * Tim Watts, Right Hand Batsman Tim played in the Yorkshire League * Bernie Maher, Wicket Keeper, Right Hand Batsman. Bernie played for Derbyshire. * Bill Fowler, Left arm spin bowler & batsman. Bill played for Derbyshire, Auckland & Northern Districts. * Devon Malcolm, Fast Right Arm Bowler. Devon played for Derbyshire and England. * Harshad Patel, Right Hand Batsman. * Bradley Parker, Right Hand Batsman. Bradley played in the Yorkshire League There are of course many others who paid their own way out to play for Ellerslie during their off season.  Personalities  Over the years the club has had many personalities through its ranks but some were to become or were more famous than just cricketers. * Roger Douglas: Politician, Minister of Finance * David Curtis: Pop Star * Doug Cowie: NZ Cricket Umpire. *Avi 'Beam' Singh: The heart and sole of Ellerslie Cricket Club in the 2010s. It is rumoured that Avi once batted for 5 hours in 30 degree heat to save a crucial two-day match, declining to have any water at each drinks break as he \\"hadn't earned it\\". One thing about this club over the years is it has had many personalities, not as famous as those mentioned above but real personalities in their own right. Unfortunately for the readers' sake it is not possible to pass on the reasons.  Club history  As far as records show and from photos of earlier teams The Ellerslie Cricket Club was up and running in the early 1920s playing in the Auckland City & Suburban competition. There proof that there was a wicket at the Ellerslie Gardens, now the Auckland Racing Club and an All England Eleven played an Auckland Twenty Two in 1877, so the club says if there was a wicket why not a cricket club? The name of such a club is not known but the money is on it being \\"The Ellerslie Cricket Club\\". The Roaring Twenties Given all the facts, it is known the club existed in the 1920s and was very strong playing in the City & Suburban Competition. One famous name that appears in the photos is Charlie Kerr. Charlie was a great spinner and many say if he had played in the ACA competition he would have played for Auckland and maybe New Zealand but Charlie was a loyal C&S; man and later played for the Greenlane Cricket Club up until the mid Nineties which made him a very mature cricketer indeed. Not much more is known about the club in those days but there are photos and a picture speaks a thousand words. The Fifties & Sixties The next era there is any history on, starts in the 1950s and this to is made up of photo's and some history related by some old time residents in Ellerslie but it is all very sketchy. The club did cater for some very useful schoolboy cricketers in the late Fifties namely Rex Hooton who later went on to play for Northern Districts, Auckland and in later years coached Auckland. There is also John Wiltshire who went on to play for and captain Auckland. The Club played out of The Ellerslie Domain in those days as Michaels Ave was just a gorse covered swamp but hard work and dedication by a loyal team helped by the Ellerslie Borough Council transformed it into an excellent sports field over many years. It was and still is shared by the Ellerslie Football Club and between them they purchased and located an old US Army building which became their clubrooms until 1979. During these years the club had just two Saturday Teams plus a Junior Team playing in the ACA within the Eastern Districts Association and enjoyed a good competition with clubs like Panmure, Mt Wellington, St Heliers and Parnell. They also had a very social Sunday team and every Sunday saw a huge picnic atmosphere at the Ave with cricket being the secondary fixture. Stalwarts of the club were John and June Molesworth and through their hard work the clubs Saturday Teams flourished and later in the Sixties the club gained much needed new blood & went from strength to strength into the 1970s. The Seventies This decade saw the club move from a mid grade club playing good cricket through to the ACA Premiership Competition in just 9 seasons. Ellerslie Cricket Club started the Seventies with a strong committee dedicated to getting to the top and each year its overall player strength built up with players like Ross Hackett and Steve Chapman: two very good players from Australia. Ross played for NSW Juniors in his early years. Other players to strengthen the club in the early 1970s were Alan & John Verral, Ian Rout, Graeme Atkinson and many others. In the 1973/74 season Ellerslie won the ACA Major Club Championship for clubs with 4 or more teams in their ranks which was a great feather in its cap because from then on everyone sat up and respected Ellerslie as a club of the future. That same year Ellerslie gained the services of Malcolm Beach from the Eden Roskill club and Stu McKay both very good spin bowlers and along with the talents of Steve Chapman and Blain Mahood both medium/fast bowlers. Ellerslie was starting to make heads turn. During the 1976/77 season the then Secretary of the ACA Mr Quinton Baddelly introduced promotion relegation twice a year and this timed in very well with Ellerslie's performances on and off the field and by winning each grade Ellerslie entered both at Christmas and at season's end they were knocking on the Premiership door. This was starting to upset some of the old boys in the ACA but too late because in the 1978/79 season Ellerslie won its way into the ACA Premiership Competition and its First A side won their way into the ACA Senior A Competition. Ellerslie was the first club to actually win its way into the premiership in decades as other clubs like Takapuna & Howick Pakuranga were installed in the premiership purely on club numbers. Ellerslie won its way in by winnings and were proud of it. The Eighties The club really started to grow & with the promotion to the Premiership competition. Ellerslie gained the services of two outstanding English professionals, Wilf Slack, a stylish left hand opening batsmen and medium pace bowler who was West Indian and Ian Gould an excellent wicketkeeper and right hand batsman. Both Wilf & Ian hailed from the Middlesex County Cricket Club 2nd XI but in future years would both move on and play for England. Ellerslie took the field in their first Premiership match against Suburbs New Lynn in a one-day match up against current Auckland and New Zealand players Peter Webb & John Reid. Ellerslie won that match and this was the start of some very good years in the 1980s. Under the captaincy of, first, Malcolm Beach and then Bill Fowler, the team progressed into a formidable cricket team gaining respect within the cricket community. Even though Ellerslie struggled some seasons while in their building stages, it never finished last in either the One or Two Day Competitions. The 1983/84 season was the turning point for the club when it finished * 2nd in the Major Club Championship, * 1st in the HEC MEMORIAL ROSEBOWL (best premier run rate) * 3rd Grade won THE OPOTIKI CUP winning the grade, * 4th and one day 1 pennant winners for 1st round wins * and the highlight of the season when the Premiers won the * LION BREWERIES CUP for the ONE DAY FINAL win over Papatoetoe on the last ball of the day at Eden Park No 1. This was the year of big, mean Ole (Stan) Mortenson: Ellerslie's English professional from Derbyshire. Stan was a fast bowler and hailed from Denmark; he terrified many a batsman and umpire alike. Other notable players of the day were the old sea dog Alan Hill and the young brigade of Martin Pringle, Martin Bradley, Mark Sumich, John McGregor & Mark Keogh who were to be the nucleus of the team for many years to come under the captaincy of Bill (chook) Fowler. This was not to be the last of Ellerslie's successes as they went on to win the ACA 2 DAY PREMIERSHIP title in the 1985/86 season and probably the main reason for this was a good all round team spearheaded by Devon Malcolm a very fast right arm bowler and another West Indian playing out of the Derbyshire County Club in England. Devon also moved on to play for England and took many wickets at test level. This win was very exciting as once again Papatoetoe were Ellerslie's main rival with only 4.28 points separating the two teams going into the last match of the season but an outright victory over University saw Ellerslie through to its first major premiership title. As well the Senior A also won the PRESIDENTS CUP as winners of the Senior A competition making the 1985/86 season the most successful in the history of the Ellerslie Cricket Club. Other One Day Championship titles were collected in 1986/87 over Takapuna, 1989/90 over Suburbs New Lynn and 1991/92 over Cornwall. Ellerslie also played in the Premiership final against Grafton in a 3-day match at Eden Park but were outclassed on this occasion but finishing 2nd was no mean feat. Sadly a number of Ellerslie's premier players retired in the early nineties leaving a big gap to fill but it has had many fine performances since, with still many more to come. As well as the contribution given by all the players over this period to gain such successes it would not have been possible without the undying presence of Frank (Bomber) Lancaster: the Premier Teams scorer. Bomber has hardly missed a game and is still turning up wet or fine to score for the team he has cared for, for over 20 years. Now that is dedication. The Nineties This decade started well but as mentioned, the retirement of some of Ellerslie's established players saw the club go back into a rebuilding mode and even though it had not gained great heights, the club has been steady. Financial woes affected the club like many other sports clubs in the later part of the decade. The ongoing committees have worked hard to fix the problems. The Millennium As is, of most sports, the success of the club is gauged on the top team and unfortunately due to a restructure by the ACA the Premier Team was relegated in early 2000s to a new grade called 1st grade with promotion relegation. Ellerslie is now (2006/2007 season) back in the Premier grade after Ellerslie's top team merged with Auckland University's first grade. Going into season 2010/11 thanks to hard work from the committee the club is now once again a stand-alone Premier Club.

History =Original building= Planning for the original Bensalem Township High School (Bensalem High School or BHS for short) began in 1920 with the acquisition of land adjoining the school property known as the Cornwells Heights Elementary School, at 2400 Bristol Pike. A. Oscar Martin, registered architect, of Doylestown, Pennsylvania, was selected to design a building along the lines and scope established by the Board of Education. Mr. Martin had years of experience in designing school buildings. The architect prepared drawings in 1920, using the existing two-story stone building of two classrooms as a nucleus. He developed a progressive planning system of which one unit was constructed that same year. It consisted of one classroom and one end of the central corridor. After final installments and improvements, the building was formally dedicated and opened in March 1930. At the time, only 212 had enrolled in the school. =Second building= During the 1940s Bensalem Township had begun an accelerated rate of growth which produced serious over-crowding in the existing schools. By 1945, it was clear that a new high school building was needed. The board purchased a site of of ground from Minnie Hansell on August 31, 1946 for the sum of $18,000. The first plans for a new high school called for a two-story building to accommodate about six hundred students. These plans were formulated under the leadership of Dr. A. Kurtz King, who succeeded Samuel K. Faust as superintendent of schools. The school board and Dr. King weathered the storm of the rejection of funds from the State School Building Authority and the discarding of plans and drawings by H. F. Everett and Associates of Allentown, Pa., architects, in 1947. Planning started from the very beginning again, this time for a one-story school building to house twice the original school population. It involved Dr. King, succeeding superintendents William B. Shellenberger and Robert K. Shafer, and the school directors, who formed the first municipal authority in Bucks County for the erection of school buildings, with the help of the Township Board of Supervisors. Contracts for construction of the new high school were placed in March 1953. Groundbreaking ceremonies were on May 5, 1953, and cornerstone laying, on November 9, 1954. Flag raising exercises took place on November 18, 1954. The new high school, located at Street Road and Asbury Avenue, Cornwells Heights, was finally occupied on September 8, 1954, with 975 students in attendance. The cost was $2,685,000. The building contained these instructional facilities: twenty - five general classrooms, five science rooms, three commercial rooms, three homemaking rooms, two industrial arts rooms, four health and physical education rooms, two arts and crafts rooms, two music rooms, seven administrative offices, two faculty rooms, a student activity room, auditorium, cafeteria, and library. Within a few years this building was nearing its peak for pupil capacity. Population growth of the area continued, and by mid-1963, the Board of School Directors was faced with another building problem. =Third building= Bensalem High was built in two phases over multiple years with the northernmost wing and central portion containing the auditorium known as the \\"old\\" building or the \\"north-end\\" and the southernmost wing known as the \\"new\\" building or \\"south- end.\\" Not coincidentally, the gymnasium in the older wing is known as \\"Gym 1\\" while the gymnasium in the newer wing is \\"Gym 2.\\" Similarly, the older cafeterias are known as \\"Cafeteria A\\" and \\"Cafeteria B\\" and the newer \\"Cafeteria C.\\" The former high school building became the Neil A. Armstrong Middle School. An arena-style basketball gymnasium was not built at Bensalem High School (it was to be phase 3) until 2011. Until then, the school's varsity boys' basketball team continued to play its home games in the much larger gym at the former BHS, Neil A. Armstrong Middle School nearby. The Bensalem School Board closed Armstrong due to declining enrollment throughout the school district in grades 6 to 8, with students subsequently able to enroll in the district's two other middle schools. Nevertheless, the high school boys' basketball team still uses the Armstrong gym throughout the winter season. The BHS campus also includes an outdoor football/soccer/track and field arena, Bensalem Township Memorial Stadium. The bowl-style design features a below-grade playing surface and concrete stands on both the home and visitors sidelines. Underneath the home stand are fully enclosed locker rooms for both the home and visitor teams, with full shower and plumbing facilities, and coaches rooms. The locker rooms can be accessed directly from field level, allowing a constant separation of athletes from spectators throughout any event. In addition, both the home and visitor stands have full concessions facilities along the exterior spectator concourses. At the time of its erection in the 1970s, the stadium was considered state-of-the art, with the vast majority of schools throughout Pennsylvania still using metal or wooden grandstands. Even today, it is rare for a high school to have locker room and shower facilities within its stadium. Despite its obvious age, Bensalem Township Memorial Stadium is still considered one of the top high school football facilities in the football-rich state of Pennsylvania as evidenced by its selection in 2004 to host the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class AAAA (large school) Eastern Championship game (also statewide semifinal) between Neshaminy High and Easton Area High School. Over the years, the stadium has also hosted the Philadelphia region's premiere high school outdoor track and field meet, the District One Championships, on numerous occasions. In the early 1980s, the stadium was the first in Bucks County and one of the first in Pennsylvania to employ a synthetic track. At the time, other large public schools in Lower Bucks County including Nesahminy, William Tennent, Harry S Truman, Pennsbury and Council Rock all used antiquated cinder tracks. Another asset to the Bensalem Township track facility is its Olympic-style eight-lane width. Because of space limitations and high resurfacing costs, many high schools feature narrower tracks, which do not meet the requirements of true championship-style meets. =Renovation= Dating back at least to the 1980s, rumors had circulated periodically that the school district was considering erecting a \\"field house\\" facility on open land near the student parking lot. During the 2009 summer break, construction of a full sized multi - purpose field house began with its groundbreaking ceremonies taking place sometime in July. The 45,000 square foot, 3 court spectator gym can seat up to 1,700 people and will be used for community events along with Bensalem sports related activities. The project is being largely funded with $10 million from a 2007 $30 million school district bond. The township, which was looking to build a community center, added $2 million, and another $2 million comes from a state matching grant making the total budget somewhere around $14 million. In December 2011 the Gym was officially dedicated and hosted basketball games shortly thereafter. As of August 2017, Bensalem High School welcomes in a newly formed interior from a $78 million renovation. It includes: modern classrooms with StarBoard Software technology, a new performing arts center, a new cafeteria, a new library, an internet cafe, two new softball fields, a new natatorium, a new STEM laboratory area, and a \\"track\\" course selection system to increase college readiness. Cafeterias and gyms have also been consolidated. =Dual Enrollment= The high school does offer a Dual Enrollment program for some courses. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions.Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement. site accessed March 2010. http://www.patrac.org/ Notable graduates *Aaron Jay Kernis, Class of 1977 *Ruth Matlack, Class of 1949 ‚Äì All-American Girls Professional Baseball League player *Ralph Tamm, Class of 1984 ‚Äì Member of two Super Bowl Champion teams (1991 season and 1994 season) *Ellen Voorhees, Class of 1976 valedictorian, computer scientist References External links * School home page * School band home page * Bensalem Alumni Association Category:Public high schools in Pennsylvania Category:1920 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:School buildings completed in 1959 Category:Schools in Bucks County, Pennsylvania Category:Educational institutions established in 1920 ","title":"Bensalem High School"},{"id":"6602615","text":"Professor Anthony John \\"Tony\\" Stockwell, FRAS is a British academic.

Cantwell presiding. The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RSHM), an international apostolic institute of religious women, were commissioned to teach at the new institution. Through their emphasis on liberal arts education and respect for all cultures, the Sisters worked to promote the growth of the human person by creating an environment which enabled young women to work for their own spiritual, educational, and personal development.Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School - Campus Ministry In 1946, the Most Reverend John J. Cantwell, Archbishop of Los Angeles, established Cantwell High School. At the time of its founding, the school was temporarily located on the top floor at St. Alphonsus Grade School, in East Los Angeles. On October 23, 1946, the school relocated to the campus it still occupies on a picturesque seventeen-acres in Montebello, California. Based on his respect for their teaching abilities, the archbishop invited the Christian Brothers of Ireland to staff the school. The school was dedicated by Archbishop Cantwell on April 13, 1947. As the flag was raised over the ‚Äúlargest addition to the Archdiocesan school system,‚Äù tribute was paid to the teaching qualities of the Christian Brothers who constituted the initial Cantwell faculty. The Irish Christian Brothers had long influenced Bishop Cantwell as he attended the Patrician Brothers Monastery National School in Fethard in his early childhood years. On-going changes occurred over the years and with the closure of nearby Sacred Heart of Mary High School in 1990, the girls attending that high school were incorporated into Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School, thus extended the dream of Archbishop John J. Cantwell‚Äôs vision to provide an opportunity of a Catholic education for all God‚Äôs children. =1950s thru 1980s= In 1956, a beautiful new building was completed at 441 North Garfield Avenue, and in September, 1957, 450 girls enrolled at the new Sacred Heart of Mary High School. The Sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary became the focal point of all religious activities. In 1961, ground was broken for an 800-seat auditorium, and a chapel was constructed adjacent to the convent. Both were completed in 1962. Just the chapel and convent remain today, as the rest of the property was sold. Under the watchful eyes of the Sacred Heart of Mary sisters, the Catholic boys of Cantwell High came no closer to the girls during school hours than a lingering glance through the chain-link fence. \\"The sisters were very restrictive,\\" recalled an alumnus whose wife attended Sacred Heart of Mary while he was at Cantwell. \\"Though we used to look at the girls from afar, the best we could do was cruise by, (until after school).\\" =Consolidation= Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary as an entity began when Sacred Heart of Mary High School, an all girls school administered by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and Cantwell High School, an all boys school administered by the Irish Christian Brothers, consolidated into one lay administered coed school in 1991. For many, especially the alumni of both schools, the consolidation meant the end of an era. Since the merger, enrollment is at about 600 students. Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, CSHM is a coeducational, college preparatory institution. The school's spiritual patrons are St. Philip of Jesus, and the Sacred Heart of Mary, Mother of Jesus. With the advent of young women moving to the young men's campus, the Cantwell former school motto for the conjoined schools was changed from the Latin for \\"Act Manfully\\", \\"Viriliter Age\\", to \\"Act with the Character of Christ\\", \\"Age cum Anima Christi\\". The girls all became \\"Cardinals\\" and their mascot \\"Scooter\\" was laid to rest without ceremony. Demographics The majority of the CSHM families reside in communities surrounding the East Los Angeles area. 95% of the students are Roman Catholic. Economically, the families are characterized as blue collar/skilled labor workers and managers of small privately owned businesses. 52% of the students live below the government designated ‚Äúpoverty‚Äù line and would qualify for the federal school lunch program if they attended a public school. CSHM has a very generous financial aid program and close to a fourth of the students work jobs after school to supplement their tuition. As a school it is completely self-supporting with the exception of support from foundations and many donors, including the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and support from the archdiocese of Los Angeles for the physical plant of the school, and its property. Athletics The co-curricular program encourages students to develop mental and physical skills, a healthy competitive spirit, teamwork, and self-discipline.

History Established in 1993 following a perceived need to examine New Zealand's international relations and situation more closely, the Centre has had four directors. Terence O'Brien, who was a former New Zealand diplomat with a career as New Zealand Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, the European Commission in Brussels, and the United Nations in New York, was appointed as Director when the Centre was first established.

The Centre put out a number of publications and thought pieces related to New Zealand security and defence issues. David Dickens, the former Deputy Director of the CSS, took over when Mr O'Brien's term finished in 2001 but he was controversial as a 'National Party' hack and there was a Select Committee enquiry into his appointment which issued a critical report and Dickens lasted less than two years until 2002.

Plot  To√±o (Juan Manuel Bernal) is being held for questioning by police agent Gardu√±o (Dami√°n Alc√°zar), a murder has been committed and Gardu√±o is determined to get to the bottom of this; To√±o starts then telling his story: A few weeks before, he and his wife, Ana (Elena Anaya) and their daughter, decided to come back to settle down in To√±o's hometown, after living for a long time in Mexico City. But things get complicated when To√±o re-encounters Andrea (Patricia Llaca), a woman for whom he had lusted since adolescence and who's now married to Nicol√°s (Mario Iv√°n Mart√≠nez), To√±o's best friend from high school. Soon, the unfulfilled and repressed desires of both To√±o and Andrea are passionately released with their sexual encounter. Hiding from To√±o's wife and Andrea's husband, they are helped by To√±o's brother (Jos√© Mar√≠a Yazpik), who runs a hotel in the town, and whose blue room is lent to the lovers (hence the name of the film, \\"The Blue Room\\").

Controversy  The film was quite controversial due to its erotic advertising, most advertising materials showed Patricia Llaca fully nude lying on a bed and looking at the camera. Billboards and ads on public transport and in magazines, etc., showed the same or a similar picture, raising controversy thanks to Llaca's nudity. In some media, her buttocks were then digitally covered with a blanket to calm the sensitivities of offended Mexicans. The film itself was indeed highly erotic, showing full nude scenes of both Patricia Llaca and Juan Manuel Bernal. In this sense, the advertising was true to the film. Llaca, however, declared that the film producers deliberately \\"used\\" her nude body to advertise the film.  Awards  In 2002, the film received the Silver Precolumbian Circle at the Bogota Film Festival in the category of best film and was nominated in the same year to receive the Golden Spike at the Valladolid International Film Festival.

This tale has several parallels in the literature and folklore of various cultures. Synopsis A baron who was a magician learned that his son was fated to marry a girl born to a poor peasant. He went to that peasant and, when he lamented that he could not feed six children, offered to take the littlest one. He threw her into the river, and she floated to a fisherman's house, and the fisherman raised her. She was beautiful, and one day when the baron was hunting, he saw her and his companion asked who she would marry. To cast her horoscope, he asked when she was born, and she told her story. He sent her to his brother, with a letter telling his brother to kill her.This trope, sometimes called a \\"bellerophontic letter\\", receives a classic version in the Greek myth of Bellerophon. She fell among robbers, who altered the letter to say she should be married to his son, and his brother had the wedding held at once. The baron came and learned this, and took his daughter-in-law for a walk along the cliff. She begged for her life, and he did not push her in, but he threw a golden ring into the sea and told her that she should never show him or his son her face again without the ring. She went off and got work in a kitchen. The baron came to dinner at that house, and she was preparing fish. She found the ring in it. The guests were so taken with the fish that they wanted to meet the cook, and she went with the ring. The baron realised that he could not fight fate, and announced she was his son's true bride and took her back with him to his home, where she lived happily with her husband. Variations =Self-fulfilling prophecy= The main plot of the story follows the common fairy tale plot of a child of lowly birth predicted to marry someone of high birth, usually royal.Stith Thompson, The Folktale, p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977 Because of the very actions undertaken to prevent this, the marriage takes place. Other variants include the Russian The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars, the German The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs, and the Indian The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate. It is unusual among tales of this type in that the lowly child is a girl; most variants feature a boy of lowly birth and a bride of much higher birth. While such tales normally include attempts to kill the child in infancy, a letter ordering the child's death altered to order the wedding,Joseph Jacobs, \\"The Fish and the Ring\\", English Fairy Tales and difficult tasks imposed on the child, the specific one of the ring is not common. =Returning ring= One of the early sources or inspirations, could be the Greek tale of Polycrates or Polykrates, ruler of Samos. According to Herodotus, Polycrates was making a treaty with Amasis the king of Egypt, when Amasis told Polycrates to dispose of some of his most valued possessions, explaining that even he must experience hardships and sorrow, or his life will end in tragedy. Polycrates's, taking Amasis's advice throw away some of his possessions including his most prized, emerald ring. The loss of the ring weighed heavy on Polycrates; one day a fisherman brought a great fish as tribute, and as is the custom, had the fish gutted. When the fish was cut open, Polycrates was surprised and delighted to see his old emerald ring. The Sanskrit drama of ≈öakuntalƒÅ, as written by KƒÅlidƒÅsa, is also a parallel. A king had fallen in love with ≈öakuntalƒÅ, whom he married and gifted an emerald ring, with his name engraved upon it. However, when he returned to his capital, he forgot about ≈öakuntalƒÅ until one day a fisherman was seen selling such a ring in the marketplace and had been arrested. The fisherman told the king that he had found the ring in the belly of a fish. The king thus remembers Sak√∫ntala and they are reunited. Another early variant, could be the Talmudic tale of the biblical Solomon, who recovers his signet ring in a similar manner. A similar Talmudic tales is the tale of a wealthy and irreligious man who hearing from an astrologer that all his worldly goods shall one day belong to his neighbour Joseph, a poor and religious man, sold all his wealth and bought a large diamond which he attached onto his turban. One day while trying to cheat the stars again, by leaving his old home he embarked on a ship for a distant port. On the deck a great wind blew, taking his turban and diamond with it into the depth of the sea. Shortly after this event Joseph was preparing his fish for cooking on sabbath eve, when inside the fish's innards he saw a large diamond, all that remained of the wealthy man's riches.'Popular Tales and Fictions: Their Migrations and Transformations' By W. a. Clouston, Published by Kessinger Publishing, 2003 , An Irish variation is found in Tain Bo Fraich, in which Ailill gives his daughter Findabair a ring, which she then gives to her lover Fraech, who is hated by Ailill. Ailill discovers the ring among Fraech's things, and throws it into the river, where it is swallowed by a salmon. Fraech sees this, commands a servant to catch the salmon and cook it. When Ailill demands the ring, Findabair sends a servant to deliver the fish with the ring on top. Ailill demands that Fraech tell where the ring came from, and Fraech lies, saying he found it in the salmon and not before. Despite the lie, Fraech and Findabair are able to depart for their own lands. There are also two somewhat similar tales found in British literature. In Jocelyn's Life of St. Kentigern, King Rederech of Strathclyde discovers Queen Languueth's affair with a soldier, to whom she gave a ring. The king steals the ring from the sleeping soldier, and demands the queen produce the ring in three days or else face death. Languueth confesses her sin to St. Kentigern, who then commands a messenger to go fishing in the Clyde; a salmon is caught, gutted, and the ring is found. The queen then produces the ring for the king, and escapes death. A similar version is found in Elis Gruffudd's Cronicl (16th century), though in this instance the story is attached to Maelgwn Gwynedd, and the queen is innocent, having lost the ring while walking. Another connected story is one of the Marian miracle stories, dating to no later than the 1200s, about a grocer whom a man is determined to trick. His gives a ring as security to the grocer, secretly steals it, and then demands it from her. He accidentally drops the ring into the river and meanwhile the grocer prays to Mary. The grocer's daughter buys a fish and they find the ring inside. Another connected story is the Northern German folktale of The Three Gifts. One day three wealthy students find a poor weaver and give him one hundred dollars. The weaver hid the money in some rags; however, his wife sells them to a rag and bone man. The students return to find the weaver poorer than before, and give him another hundred dollars, this time they tell him to be more careful; so the weaver hides it in a dust-tub; however, his wife sells the dust-tub, losing the money a second time. When the students returned a third time they angrily give him a piece of lead stating that they would more foolish than he if they gave him money a third time. One day a fisherman came to the weaver's home, asking if he could use the lead as a weight for his net, promising the weaver the first big fish he catches. The weaver agrees and the fisherman brings him his fish. When gutting the fish the weaver finds a large shining stone and sells it for one thousand dollars making him a wealthy man. There is a near exact cognate of the German tale in an Arabian tale, though the man is a ropemaker not a weaver. In Belgium there is the story about the foundation of the Abbaye Notre-Dame d'Orval. According to this, the widowed Mathilda of Tuscany was visiting the site, when she lost her wedding ring in a spring, to her great distress. When she prayed for the return of the ring, a trout appeared on the surface of the water with the ring in its mouth. She exclaimed \\"Truly this place is a Val d'Or\\", from which the name \\"Orval\\" is derived, and in gratitude made available the funds for the foundation of the monastery here. The abbey arms show the trout and ring. The spring still supplies water to the monastery and its brewery.

Originally, a total of 27 ships were planned, but due to programme delays and overruns, only six were eventually ordered. Their construction began in the early 2000s, and by 2009, all six were in active service. The six vessels are named after Malaysian states. Classification While their size and tonnage implies the Kedah-class ships to be corvettes, they are classified as offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) by the Royal Malaysian Navy, a category more common with law enforcement or coast guard vessels, not naval warships. This is rooted in the fact that the Kedah class was delivered in a condition named for but not with, meaning that certain weapon systems were not included in the original purchase, but all provisions to install and use them, including sensors and electronics, are already present in the ships. The weapons themselves can be easily \\"plugged in\\" with little delay as soon as the Royal Malaysian Navy has purchased them. These purchases however have not yet been made. Currently, the Kedah-class vessels are armed with guns only (76 mm gun on the bow, 30 mm gun on the aft), making them quite lightly armed and fairly vulnerable for naval ships of their size, thus justifying their listing as OPVs rather than proper corvettes.Hooten, Ted (1 August 2013): Corvettes and OPVs: Offshore Investments . Asian Military Review. Development In the 1990s, the Royal Malaysian Navy identified the need to replace their ageing patrol boats. These 31 m long vessels built by Vosper Ltd with a displacement of 96 tons had been in service since the 1960s. After receiving government approval, the Malaysian Navy ran a competition for the design in 1996, planning to purchase 27 vessels over 15 years. The specifications aimed for a design with a displacement of 1,300 tons and an overall length of 80 m. It was already noted at that time that this resembled full-fledged corvettes rather than patrol vessels, but the eventual winning bid would turn out to be even larger. The Australian bid proposed a Joint Patrol Vessel, to be designed by Australian Transfield Shipbuilding and subsequently purchased by the Malaysian Navy as well as the Royal Australian Navy. Other contenders were the German Naval Group consortium as well as British shipyards Vosper Thornycroft and Yarrow Shipbuilders. In October 1997, the German Naval Group consortium, headed by Blohm + Voss, was declared the winner with their design based on the modular MEKO family of warships, and a contract for six vessels was signed by the Malaysian Navy and PSC-Naval Dockyard on 5 September 1998, with a unit cost of 270 million dollar per vessel. Progress delay The shipbuilding has been plagued by financial and technical problems and delays. The first setback occurred when the first hull completed by PSC-Naval Dockyard failed to pass pre-delivery sea trials due to technical problems and quality issues. The crisis continued until the Malaysian government replaced the management team. The programme resumed, but the scandal discouraged the Malaysian Government from further investments. In June 2006, after a total of 18 months of delays, the Royal Malaysian Navy commissioned KD Kedah, followed by a second hull, KD Pahang in August of the same year, and a third hull, KD Perak on 12 November 2007. By July 2009, six vessels had been launched. Characteristics The Kedah class is based on the MEKO 100 corvette. It is designed to have low radar detectability, low noise, low heat dissipation, and have an economical cruising speed. The main radar, TRS-3D/16-ES is a fully coherent multi-mode phased array C-band radar capable of fully automatic detection, track initiation, and classification of various types of targets. It is capable to track 400 air and surface targets with the detection range up to 200 km and the corresponding update times between 1 and 6 seconds. An advanced control system known as Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) is used to monitor and control the platform machinery of the ships, including propulsion, electrical, damage control, and auxiliary machinery and systems. Due to the small ship complement, the design relies on a high degree of automation for improved operational effectiveness and survivability of the ships. The design uses intelligent electronics and sensors interconnected by data buses. This enables monitoring and control of machinery from several shipboard locations. The ship has redundant systems to improve survivability. All Kedah-class vessels are fitted for but not with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) surface-to-air missile and the Exocet MM40 Block 2 anti-ship missile. It also can fitted with BrahMos cruise missile if it was purchased. Once the weapons themselves were purchased, it would reportedly take only one day for them to be installed, after which they could be immediately used with full functionality. Improved Design and Next Order In Defence Services Asia 2018 (DSA 2018) BHIC unveiled the new improved design of the Kedah-class to fulfill the Royal Malaysian Navy modernization program,15 to 5 program. Under this program 12 more Kedah-class will be order to complement the six existing Kedah-class makes the total of 18 Kedah-class will be in service with Royal Malaysian Navy. The design incorporated improvement in stealth design where the ships will have low radar cross section then before. This new design also modular where the end user can choose whether to armed this ships with guns only or to fitted for but not with missiles and torpedo.http://www.malaysiandefence.com/bns-ngpv-concept- dsa-2018-shorts/ Major Operation KD Pahang involved in Anti-piracy measures in Somalia in 2008.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2008/09/05/three-navy-vessels-to- protect-malaysian-ships-in-gulf-of-aden/ KD Perak involved in naval blockade in 2013 Lahad Datu standoff.

The short documentary, which is now in the public domain, explains what an atom is, how nuclear energy is released from certain kinds of atoms, the peacetime uses of nuclear power, and the by-products of nuclear fission. The film is Sutherland's most-decorated film, having won numerous honors at film festivals. The film also received a theatrical release, opening at the Pantages and Hillstreet Theatres in Los Angeles on July 2, 1953.The Hollywood Reporter, July 3, 1953, pg. 13 The distributor was Al O. Bondy, who made the short available for free.Boxoffice Barometer, Jan. 30, 1954, pg. 145 A is for Atom was re-released by General Electric in 1964. John Sutherland Studios was contracted by GE to modernize the film. Changes include included tighter editing, new music, new narration (Bud Hiestand did the voice-over on the original) and a focus on nuclear power as opposed to nuclear bombs. Plot A narrator is relating what is an atom and how atomic energy can be harnessed by man to produce \\"limitless\\" energy. Dr. Atom (a caricature with an atom for a head) then explains the similarities between the solar system and atomic structure. He then goes on to relate how the atom is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. After this, the narrator explains how there are more than 90 elements with many possible isotopes for each. The history of atomic energy is then over viewed beginning with the discovery of artificial transmutation. This then led to the discovery of nuclear fission and eventually nuclear weapons and nuclear energy using the chain reaction of radioactive material. The Oakridge uranium factory is then discussed as well as the first nuclear reactor and the first uses of plutonium. The future of fantastical nuclear power plants is then explained. The short ends on the uses of radio isotopes in medicine and agriculture. The film includes a blue \\"nuclear giant\\" character, very similar to Dr. Manhattan from the graphic novel Watchmen.

Opened in 1921 as a vaudeville house, the Capitol later served as a movie theater, and then as a venue for rock concerts. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the 3,200-seat theatre was a popular stop on many major rock artist's tours. The venue was known for its in-house video system which resulted in a number of good quality, black and white video bootlegs. After it closed, the building fell into disrepair and it was demolished in April 1991. A shopping center known as Capitol Plaza occupies the site now.  History  = Vaudeville and films = The Capitol Theatre opened on October 7, 1921 with sold-out a concert by the U.S. Marine Band, which helped raise funds for a pipe organ in the city's high school. By the 1960s, it was known as the Capitol Cinema, and by 1970s the theater was showing adult films. = Rock venue = On June 27, 1971, the popular Fillmore East theater in Manhattan closed, ending owner and rock promoter Bill Graham's stipulation that acts who played at his venue were prohibited from performing at any theater within 75 miles for the following four months. John Scher, a young rock promoter from West Orange, New Jersey, seized on the closure of the Fillmore East by taking over the Capitol Theatre and transitioning it into a rock venue. The first concert at The Capitol Theatre was by The J. Geils Band and Humble Pie on December 16, 1971. The theater closed in 1989 due to a variety of factors, including the changing music industry and the 1981 opening of Brendan Byrne Arena at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. John Scher had transitioned to also promoting concerts at the arena, enabling much of the Capitol Theatre staff to obtain employment there when the theater closed.  In popular culture  The Marshall Tucker Band concert from February 18, 1977 was released on December 4, 2007 as a 2 CD/DVD package called Carolina Dreams Tour '77, marking the 30th anniversary of the concert.

Smith played saxophone for a number of prominent band leaders including Duke Ellington and Earl Hines as well as vocalist Ella Fitzgerald. He recorded his only album as leader in 1959 and despite intending to record a follow-up, he was injured in an accident and nothing else was released. Biography =Early life= Smith was born and raised in Alsdorf, Texas, a small township near Telico in the outskirts of Dallas, where he attended school as a child. Smith earned the name \\"Buster\\" from his parents as a baby, as he was born as an overweight child. Buster was the third of five boys and had no sisters, though both of his older brothers died in childhood of measles. Smith's early musical influences were his mother, and his father, who played guitar. At the age of four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ because he believed it would only direct Buster to a life of sin. =Early career= In 1919, Smith picked cotton for a week to earn himself the money to buy a $3.50 clarinet. Smith learned to play several instruments by the time he was eighteen years old. In 1922, Smith and his family moved to Dallas. He joined the Voodie White Trio, playing Alto saxophone and clarinet. In 1923, he began his professional music career playing alto saxophone with the medicine shows, though he had to play very loudly to draw in more customers. This experience led to Smith defining his own musical style, known for being loud. The time with the medicine shows also led to Oran \\"Hot Lips\\" Page inviting Smith to join his group, the Oklahoma City Blue Devils, in 1925. Over the next few years, Smith wrote much of the group's music, learning from banjo player Johnny Clark, writing lyrics with co-workers from the bank that he worked in. =Peak success= When Smith joined the Blue Devils, the line-up consisted of Walter Page, Oran Page, Lester Young, Count Basie, Jimmy Rushing, and Emir \\"Bucket\\" Coleman. They toured the Kansas City area and the Midwest, playing jazz for a year, bringing all of its members into prominence. Basie and Page both left the group; however Smith decided to stay on, though this was very short lived and soon after he left also. After leaving the group, he and Basie formed the Buster Smith-Count Basie Band of Rhythm, where the two innovated a louder style of Jazz. Buster's contribution to the unique sound was by using a tenor saxophone reed in his alto saxophone to achieve a louder, \\"fatter\\" sound. Lester Young also joined the band and, to complement Smith's louder sound, he also opted for a harder reed, using a baritone saxophone reed on his tenor saxophone. This sound was later labelled the Texas Sax Sound. Smith gained a great amount of influence in the Texan music community and industry. Smith mentored legendary saxophonist Charlie Parker during the 1930s, developing a \\"father- son relationship\\" through mentoring Parker. In 1941, Smith decided to return to Dallas and to cease touring, though he remained active in the local music scene. In the following years, he wrote for jazz and blues bands, played often, and taught many young Texan musicians, including Aaron \\"T-Bone\\" Walker and Red Garland among others. He also performed session work with artists such as Pete Johnson's Boogie-Woogie Boys, Eddie Durham, Leo \\"Snub\\" Mosley, Bon and His Buddies, and the Don Redman Orchestra. =Solo career= In 1959, Buster led his first solo recording session in Fort Worth, as prompted by Atlantic Records. From these sessions, released by Atlantic with the title The Legendary Buster Smith, Smith's notable songs included \\"Kansas City Riffs,\\" \\"Buster's Tune,\\" \\"E Flat Boogie,\\" and Kurt Weill's \\"September Song.\\" For the sessions, Buster enlisted his brother Boston Smith to play piano, along with musicians spanning his career to date. =Later life= In the 1960s, Smith was involved in an auto accident, in which he was injured and no longer able to play the saxophone. In order to continue playing music, he started to play the bass guitar throughout Dallas and continued to participate in the Dallas musical community. Buster led a dance music band until 1980, and played in the Legendary Revelations in the mid-1980s. Smith died in Dallas on August 10, 1991, of a heart attack.

Automating the scheduling of employees increases productivity and allows organizations with hourly workforces to re-allocate resources to non- scheduling activities. Such software will usually track vacation time, sick time, compensation time, and alert when there are conflicts. As scheduling data is accumulated over time, it may be extracted for payroll or to analyze past activity. Although employee scheduling software may or may not make optimization decisions, it does manage and coordinate the tasks. Today's employee scheduling software often includes mobile applications. Mobile scheduling further increased scheduling productivity and eliminated inefficient scheduling steps. It may also include functionality including applicant tracking and on-boarding, time and attendance, and automatic limits on overtime. Such functionality can help organizations with issues like employee retention, compliance with labor laws, and other workforce management challenges. Purpose A theoretical underpinning of an employee scheduling problem can be represented as the Nurse scheduling problem, which is NP-hard. The theoretical complexity of the problem is a significant factor in the development of various software solutions. This is because systems must take into account many different forms of schedules that could be worked, and allocate employees to the correct schedule. Ultimately, optimization of scheduling is to minimize costs, but also often requires a reciprocal approach from management instead of complete reliance on software.  Transitioning to employee scheduling software  Prior to employee scheduling software companies would use physical mediums for tracking employee hours and work schedule. This then gave rise to data storage forms that later by the 80s were compatible with computer programs and software. These forms however never actually scheduled the employees, it just kept track of the employees work week, hours, and prior work schedules. This then gave way to the idea of employee scheduling software, which would be an all-inclusive system that would store and track employee work history, along with actually scheduling the employee's work week. =Punch cards= The earliest form of automated employee scheduling and managing of employee hours was the punch card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. Herman Hollerith improved the design.Trogemann, Georg (eds.); et al. (2001). Computing in Russia. Verlag. pp. 47‚Äì49. The article is by Gellius N. Povarov, titled Semen Nikolayevich Korsakov- Machines for the Comparison of Philosophical Ideas IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.Essinger, James (2004). Jacquard's Web: How a hand-loom led to the birth of the information age. Oxford: Oxford University Press. . =Magnetic tape= During the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape, as better, more capable computers became available. Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful, but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage, and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well.Aspray (ed.), W. (1990). Computing before Computers. Iowa State University Press. p. 151. . However, their influence lives on through many standard conventions and file formats.Lubar, Steven (1993). InfoCulture: The Smithsonian Book of Information Age Inventions. Houghton Mifflin. p. 302. . =Auto-scheduling and intelligent rostering= In the 2010s, the wide adoption of mobile devices and the rise of 3G, 4G, and 5G networks worldwide has made it possible to approach the task of scheduling differently. In the last decade, many software solutions have sprung up to make the lives of business owners and managers easier and less burdensome. The first wave of solutions helped small business owners to schedule, manage, and communicate with their employees in a more streamlined way. The newer way of solutions go a step further, leveraging machine learning and are being built on even newer cloud technologies. The need for automation and intelligent rostering in workforce management will continue to grow as society's heads into a gig economy.  Complexity  Algorithms are used within the employee scheduling software in order to determine not only who is working, but also the specific jobs and tasks required of the workers. The system still must be monitored, and any further issues with assigning of specifics is done manually. Within the context of roster problems and models, there are three main factors to work out the differences: the integration of days off scheduling with line of work construction and task assignment, roster construction, and demand type. These complexities thusly require that each and every workplace must optimize employee scheduling software based on their own unique set of rules, issues and needs. Additionally, it is difficult to determine optimal solution that minimize costs, meet employee preferences, distribute shifts equitably among employees and satisfy all the workplace constraints. In many organizations, the people involved in developing rosters need decision support tools to help provide the right employees at the right time and the right cost while achieving a high level of employee satisfaction. Due to constant change within work environments, new models and algorithms must be created in order to allow for flexibility as needs and demands arise. For example, when a large number of new employees are hired, as in the total workforce is increased, the scheduling software likely will need to be updated in order to allow for such a change. Features Although employee scheduling software won't necessarily improve business practices by itself, it does automate typically tedious business administration. It can also have positive effects on aspects of the business indirectly, including employee engagement, employee retention, and lowered labor costs. By providing management with large amounts of data, this software can assist management in making decisions and automatically create a work schedule that fits as many constraints as possible. Also, the software may be a part of an ERP package or other human resource management system. Features vary depending on software vendor, but some typical features include: *Gantt chart or calendar view of the schedule *Approve employee requests for time off * Reduce unproductive workforce due to over scheduling * Use weather forecasts to predict staffing needs * Days off scheduling * Allow employees to swap shifts. * Templates to roll out shift plans over medium term * Interface to payroll and/or management accounting software * Ability to easily identify unassigned shifts. * Ability to create reports for invoicing and payroll. * Manage the task of automation and data collection. * Workplace analysis * Mobile application integration * Interface agents  Future trends  As the modern workplace becomes more complex, it is likely that rostering will need to be more flexible to cater to more individualistic preferences. Artificial intelligence also looks to play a bigger role in scheduling software, requiring less oversight by management to correct issues.

He was the last-born child of Margaret Lea Houston and Sam Houston, the first elected president of the Republic of Texas. Biography Coat of Arms of Temple Lea Houston Temple Lea Houston was the only one of the Houstons' eight children to be born in the Texas governor's residence in Austin. By the time he was seven, both his parents had died. He lived with an older sister and her family in nearby Georgetown, Texas. At the age of 13, Houston left home to join a cattle drive and later worked on a riverboat on the Mississippi River. Aided by a friend of his father's, he gained an appointment as a page in the U.S. Senate and worked in Washington, D.C. for three years. Houston returned to Texas in 1877 at the age of seventeen to attend the Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Texas A&M; University). He transferred to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he graduated in 1880 with honors in law and philosophy. He \\"read the law\\" with an established firm and was admitted to the bar. He was the youngest attorney in Texas when he opened his practice. That year he was appointed as the attorney for Brazoria County near Houston, Texas. In 1882, Houston was appointed as the district attorney of the 35th Judicial District of Texas, which then covered a large part of the Texas Panhandle, based in Mobeetie, Wheeler County. Houston carried a Colt revolver, which he named \\"Old Betsy\\", always strapped to his waist. Some called him \\"the best shot in the West.\\" He wore buckskin attire from Mexico and a sombrero with a wide brim and a silver eagle. Like, his father he was more than six feet tall. He had gray eyes; his auburn hair was usually shoulder-length. His knowledge of the Bible and classical literature was all-encompassing. He easily commanded the attention of any audience. Marriage and family Established in his career, on February 14, 1883, 23-year-old Houston married Laura Cross, the daughter of a planter. They lived near Fort Elliott, which protected the border against American Indians, as well as the important cattle drives. The couple had seven children, only four of whom lived past infancy. Political career Chicago Tribune, June 21, 1896 Houston was elected in 1884 to a single term in the Texas State Senate from District 19. He concentrated his law practice on the Santa Fe railroad (the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway). He spoke French and Spanish, as well as seven Indian languages. In 1888, he gave the dedication address for the opening of the Texas State Capitol, which is still in use after several renovations.Texas Capitol Building Dedication , Texas Bob website Houston participated in the Oklahoma Territory's Land Run of 1893. In 1894, Houston moved his family to the cattle town of Woodward in Oklahoma Territory. He was legal counsel of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway; its Woodward depot became one of the most important points in the territory for cattle shipping to the East. Houston became widely known and popular for his courtroom dramatics. He was charged with murder in the shooting of a brother of the outlaw Al Jennings, after an argument in the Cabinet Saloon, and was acquitted. Houston won a reputation as a brilliant trial lawyer. In 1899, he delivered his \\"Soiled Dove Plea\\" in a makeshift courtroom in Woodward's opera house. The argument on behalf of Minnie Stacey, a prostitute who worked at the Dew Drop Inn, became famous for winning her acquittal after ten minutes' consideration by the jury. The historian William T. Hagan described Houston as \\"a flamboyant figure in his black frock coat and shoulder-length auburn hair topped off with a white Stetson. He liked to lace his arguments with literary allusions and could enthrall a courtroom or legislative chamber.\\"William T.

(AKA Foley / Cobra / The Chris / Chris Himself) (born 1974) is an American radio host. He has hosted radio shows in several cities since 1998. KiddChris currently host the KiddChris show on WEBN in Cincinnati OH. The radio show originated in his home town of Syracuse, New York. His controversial radio show made way to Wichita, Kansas ( KICT T-95FM, KDGS Power 93.9FM, KANR FLY 92.7FM) which raised the ire of local church groups. Many religious organizations attempted to band together and remove KiddChris from the airwaves, but he remained on the air. Chris then moved on to Sacramento, California where he hosted a morning show on a hip-hop station KSFM. After several months, he moved into an evening show on sister FM talk station KXOA . KiddChris's four-hour talk show was one of the highest-rated radio shows on the Pacific coast. While in Sacramento, Chris gained national attention by sending a series of prank phone calls made to O.J. Simpson to the popular Opie and Anthony and Howard Stern nationally syndicated shows and Thomas Kitajima eventually joined the show in Sacramento. In the fall of 2002, KiddChris took a hiatus from radio and retired to upstate New York. There, he rejuvenated himself and prepared for his return, which occurred on the morning of January 5, 2004, in San Antonio, Texas. He hosted a highly rated show at San Antonio's KSRX K-Rock until early August 2005. Philadelphia developments KiddChris signed with Philadelphia rock station WYSP and The KiddChris Show began broadcasting on Monday, August 29, 2005. While Chris has made remarks that the show is \\"gay\\" and that \\"it'll be gone in six months,\\" that incarnation show lasted for over two years, and the station exercised their right to extend his contract for one more. On August 21, 2006, it was announced that The KiddChris Show had been syndicated to a rock station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The show entered syndication on August 28, 2006. On September 13, 2007, the Philadelphia station announced a format change from all talk to a rock/talk hybrid. The official change, which left KiddChris on during the drive-time hours of 3pm-7pm, was announced during the KiddChris Show. Moments before the announcement, Chris, with Opie and Anthony in-studio, commented that \\"It would be a hoot if they fired us live right after the big announcement.\\" After announcing the format change, the station dropped to music and The KiddChris Show did not return to the air, causing confusion on multiple listener-run message boards as to their fate. On September 14, 2007, Chris appeared on The Opie and Anthony show and there was no mentioning of a firing. The show returned to the air on September 17, 2007, but with old recordings in-between music, leaving fans of the show confused as to its fate. Soon after, Chris stated that they needed to \\"establish the rock first. The show WILL be back\\", which confirmed the statements made by other sources that the show will be returning to its original form. On the Howard Stern Show on October 22, 2007, KiddChris called in to discuss Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel. Howard quickly turned the topic of conversation to Chris' employment at the station, claiming a \\"pretty good source\\" told him Chris would take over the morning slot from Opie and Anthony relatively soon. Chris had no comment on the rumor. On October 23, 2007, the Philadelphia rock station ended their syndication of Opie and Anthony's morning show. There was no mention of it on- air by Chris. KiddChris ended his show that night unexpectedly with Journey 's \\"Don't Stop Believin'.\\" He has stated on-air in the past that if anything were to \\"go down\\" in regards to the show, he would play that song (though he originally claimed the song would play in the background and he would continue on as if nothing was happening). No morning or afternoon show aired for about a month. On November 6, 2007, KiddChris was called by possible evening DJ Tic- Tac about his future with the station. In so many words, he stated that he \\"will be back\\", but claimed not to know when or in what time slot. Callers asked whether he was joining the Howard Stern Show staff and he said that would be impossible since he is staying in Philadelphia. He reminded fans that if he was fired, he would no longer be featured on the website. During the week of November 18, 2007, Chris's website was changed to a countdown with the tagline \\"Are You Ready?\\", set to end on Monday, November 26 at 6 AM. The countdown also appeared on his MySpace page. Prior to this, the station began to air short recordings featuring the \\"Are You Ready?\\" tagline, as well as the opening of \\"The Game\\" by Mot√∂rhead (the theme song of The KiddChris Show). The recordings varied; they included short clips from the show, clips from Brad the Cripple interviews, recordings of callers asking what happened to the show and if he was going to return in mornings and Howard Stern discussing the future of KiddChris in morning drive. However, there was no official voiceover to these clips, no direct mention of \\"The KiddChris Show\\" or any date of return. The KiddChris Show officially returned to the airwaves on Monday, November 26, 2007, at 6 AM EST. \\"Philadelphia Inquirer\\" reporter Michael Klein reported in his Sunday column of the return of the Kidd Show. The show's move to the morning slot was notable for a few reasons. It replaced the Opie and Anthony Show. In January, the show was second to rival Philadelphia morning show hosts Preston and Steve among men ages 18‚Äì34. In May 2008, KiddChris was fired over the guest's racist parody song 3 months after it was aired. Also fired was program director John Cook. Post Philadelphia developments After Foley's firing, he then hosted his own internet radio show for several months in 2009 until his transfer to KUFO in Portland, Oregon. KiddChris announced in May 2011 on the Howard Stern Show that he was bringing his morning show to WKLS \\"Project 9-6-1\\" in Atlanta. Project 9-6-1 was discontinued in August 2012. In October 2012, he began to host mornings at WEBN in Cincinnati. As of August 2020, he remains at WEBN and it is his longest tenure in any city/station.

It was inspired by the American label Simple Machines and was run by Walter Forsyth, Lee Ann Gillan, Shawn Duggan, Colin MacKenzie, Robert Jeans and Miroslav Wiesner. Born out of an influx of local alternative music being created in Halifax during the early 1990s, Cinnamon Toast Records released a number of limited 7-inch singles, each in a different colour. Cinnamon Toast Records' first single was a 7-inch pressing of the Halifax band Bubaiskull in 1992. Other notable releases are the first Jale single and a split pressing of Sloan and Eric's Trip in 1993, a Rebecca West CD in 1995, as well as a number of full length Plumtree CDs.  Halifax pop explosion  In the summer of 1993, the Halifax music scene had reached its ‚Äúpeak excitement.‚Äù. The city saw the launch of the weekly alternative arts and news publication, The Coast, providing a print platform and an accessible voice to the city's growing demographic of artists and performers. That summer there were more than thirty bands playing and competing for attention, compared to roughly ten bands the summer prior. The first Halifax Pop Explosion was held that September, and included a roster of bands on the Cinnamon Toast label, such as Jale, Plumtree, Strawberry, Eric's Trip, Bubiaskull, Thrush Hermit, Leonard Conan, Quahogs and Cheticamp as well as a number of acts associated to the Seattle based label, Sub Pop, including Velocity Girl and Sebadoh frontman Lou Barlow. Alternative super group Redd Kross also played the first annual year of the festival. By the following fall of 1994, Cinnamon Toast Records had released a wide array of singles, cassettes and other releases, Halifax Pop Explosion gained national notoriety, and its second annual lineup also included a variety of Sub Pop Records acts/bands such as, Sunny Day Real Estate, The Spinanes, Zumpano, and Six Finger Satellite. During that summer, Sub Pop had just released Eric's Trip's Gordon Street Haunting, a short EP that would bide time until their sophomore LP, Forever Again was released that fall. Jale's debut album Dreamcake would also be released on the label that year. Cinnamon Toast's Hardship Post would sign to Sub Pop during the 1994 Pop Explosion. All three of these bands had been releasing music on the local label, and within one year rose to the international stage with their respective signings to Sub Pop; ‚ÄúThe trickle of scene releases had turned into a flood.‚Äù In a 1994 Much Music television special highlighting Halifax Pop Explosion 1994, members of the Toronto band Treble Charger can be quoted as saying ‚Äú...if you can make it here (in Halifax) you can make it anywhere.‚Äù In anticipation of the second Halifax Pop Explosion, Cinnamon Toast Records released their first compilation CD ‚ÄúTrim Crusts If Desired.‚Äù This CD featured fifteen tracks by eleven bands. Each track featured on the CD was a re-release from each of Cinnamon Toasts previous 7-inch releases, as well as one unreleased single and one track from the ‚ÄúSkreech flexi disc release. In 1995, this compilation was also released in an LP version as well as a cassette. The cover image of the compilation features an old fashioned toasting rack, ‚Äú...one of those ones that held eight slices.‚Äù The inner sleeve of the CD included a listing of the band‚Äôs members, and featured illustrations depicting historical toasters. This CD release served the purpose of allowing a new generation of listeners to have access to these singles, as many younger fans did not own turntables to play 7-inches on. Capitalizing on the anticipation of the 1994 Halifax Pop Explosion, which had gained national recognition, allowed for the label to promote these local bands to a much wider, even global audience.  Notable label productions  Cinnamon Toast Records became known in Halifax for mobilizing the local music scene. This included the release and promotion of local bands, but was not limited to that action. During the Halifax Pop Explosion music festival, the label held an annual brunch of cinnamon toast which accompanied shows at local cafes and venues. In the Much Music Canada coverage of Halifax Pop Explosion 1994, operators of the label can be seen serving plates of toast to the audience of the band Rebecca West at the restaurant Cafe Mokka. In addition to food and music the Cinnamon Toast Records' brunch featured the only act of protest against the 1995 Halifax Pop Explosion festival's sponsor, the Export A tobacco company. The label was widely known for their colourful 7-inch releases and widespread promotional materials of their artists. Much of the Cinnamon Toast Records promotional ephemera such as stickers and leaflets, posters and CD inserts featured personal language uncommon among larger labels. Cinnamon Toast Records followed a DIY approach, characteristic of local scene releases of the 1990s. Rob Benvie of Thrush Hermit is quoted in the Halifax Pop Explosion 1994 television special as saying ‚Äú...the important thing is not that... people from Geffen, or Capitol (records) are hanging around here, it's more important that Murderrecords, and Cinnamon Toast exists... Halifax is bound to self destruct once all this attention gets put on us, which it will.‚Äù  Notable releases  Preceding the fall of 1994, when the Halifax Pop Explosion began to command national acclaim, Cinnamon Toast Records had released a small variety of 7-inch singles by Halifax bands. Notable bands signed to Cinnamon Toast Records include Jale, Thrush Hermit and The Quahogs. As well, Cinnamon Toast put out the music of bands in the Halifax scene known more for their live performances; such as Bubaiskull. Notable releases of the label include: = CT002: Jale, \\"Aunt Betty\\" 1992 = After forming a relationship during their studies at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University, Jale ‚Äú...discovered they could all sing in key and harmonize, divided up who would play what, and Jale (an acronym of their first names) was born.‚Äù No member of the band had any previous musical experience except Jennifer, who sang on ‚ÄúSmeared‚Äù, the DGC record label debut by fellow Halifax band Sloan. Jale was not one, however, to simply revel in their charming lack of proficiency like so many other bands who float by on their good looks. They quickly became known as the hardest working band In Halifax, practicing sometimes seven nights a week and working days to pay off their equipment. This information comes from the label Sub Pop, who would eventually sign them to a contract after their initial success with Cinnamon Toast. = CT003: Quahogs, ‚ÄúGlaze‚Äù 1993 = Recorded by Terry Pulliam at Soundmarket Recording, the ‚ÄúGlaze‚Äù single is considered to be one of the ‚Äúbest Halifax singles of all time‚Äù by the Halifax newspaper The Coast. Quahogs guitarist Todd Calder describes the project: > ‚ÄúWe saved the money we made from playing shows (mostly at the Double Deuce) > and decided to record some songs. At some point the Cinnamon Toast people > got in touch with us and asked if we'd put it out on their label. I think > this was before the recording. They said, If you do the recording we'll do > everything else including promotion.‚Äù The release of the record was also performed at the Double Deuce venue. Calder describes the show; > ‚Äú...I can't remember who we were playing with, but it was a good time. I > remember that the Cinnamon Toast people were making cinnamon toast in the > back of the bar and every time they pushed down the toaster the power went > out. We didn't know what was going on for a while. It caused some chaos.‚Äù The Coast also picked up on this technical glitch, citing it in their article on best Halifax singles as a key reason for their selection of this project for their list. = CT010: Eric's Trip / Sloan split single, 1993 = By far the best selling release of the Cinnamon Toast Label, this release attracted attention from UK based label Cargo Records which began a distribution relationship abroad. Colin Mackenzie, a founder of Cinnamon Toast recalls ‚ÄúThe folks at Cargo records in the UK went nuts for it (and) ordered all sorts and we were stuck stuffing seven-inch singles late into the night‚Ä¶many, many nights.‚Äù Sloan frontman Chris Murphy describes the project as > ‚Äú...a benefit for CKDU in Halifax. It was a co-production with Murder and > Cinnamon Toast and Sappy and maybe even one more label. I forget now. Our > version of ‚ÄòSmother‚Äô was done with a drum loop that Jay made with reel-to- > reel tape, which required that we hold a chopstick to keep it spinning. I > think the drum loop was from the band Can. I don‚Äôt remember the song. I am > happy this split seven-inch was made because Eric‚Äôs Trip is so legendary and > great.‚Äù This 7-inch featured each band covering one song of the other's catalogue. Eric's Trip covered Sloan's ‚ÄúLaying Blame‚Äù While Sloan covered the Eric's Trip song ‚ÄúSmother.‚Äù = CT015: Plumtree, ‚ÄúWater Had Leaked in my Suit‚Äù 1994, and CT017a/b: ‚ÄúMass Teen Fainting‚Äù 1995. = Formed in 1993 when sisters Carla and Lynette Gillis met up with Amanda Braden, Plumtree quickly established themselves during their mid-teens as one of the most original young bands in Canada. With the addition of Catriona Sturton on bass, the band quickly developed a highly collaborative songwriting method which combined catchy melodies, a serious approach to writing music and solid instrumentation. Their first release on Cinnamon Toast was a split 7-inch with the Prince Edward Island-based band Strawberry (CT009) also in 1994. By the end of that year, Plumtree had released their debut single ‚ÄúWater Had Leaked in my Suit,‚Äù which debuted on the charts of the radio station CFRC-FM at number 2. The next week, the single reached the top of the CFRC-FM's chart where it stayed for four consecutive weeks. The band's debut album ‚ÄúMass Teen Fainting‚Äù was recorded in Ottawa and released the following year, and earned recognition from YTV network as the ‚ÄúBest Canadian Band Under 20‚Äù in 1996.

Whilst Turkey recognised Armenia (in the borders of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) shortly after the latter proclaimed independence in September 1991, the two countries have failed to establish diplomatic relations. In 1993, Turkey reacted to the war in Nagorno-Karabakh by closing its border with Armenia out of support for Azerbaijan. In 2008‚Äì2009, the countries experienced a brief thaw in bilateral relations and in October 2009 the sides signed the normalization protocols.Turkey, Armenia to sign diplomatic deal next month, says official. H√ºrriyet. September 27, 2009. However, the protocols were never ratified, and in the following year, the rapprochement came to a close; the protocols were formally annulled by Armenia in March 2018. History = Turkic migration to Anatolia from Central Asia and the rise of empire = In 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantine Empire and captured its emperor at the Battle of Manzikert. In the resulting chaos, the Turks easily overran much of the Byzantine Anatolia. Despite Byzantine reconquests and occasional western incursions in the form of crusading armies, a series of Turkish states were established in Anatolia. These Turkic tribes came around the south end of the Caspian Sea for the most part, and hence absorbed and transmitted Islamic culture and civilization in contrast to other Turks who, such as the Cumans, became partially Westernized and Christianized. With some superiority in population and organization, regional power naturally came to rest in the hands of the Turkic speaking population. Many Turkic people came into the region fleeing from the Mongol invasions, and others later came in as soldiers fighting in the ranks of Mongol armies. Turkic Islamized populations also absorbed large numbers of the older inhabitants of Asia Minor, including Greeks and Armenians, who went over to the Islamic religion and Turkic language, creating a frontier society. Armenian communities continued to flourish under relatively tolerant Ottoman rule for centuries, either as minority populations in urban areas or as exclusively Armenian towns in rural areas. In cities such as Istanbul and ƒ∞zmir, Armenians played particularly important roles; an 1851 report in The New York Times, for instance, indicates that Armenians comprised nearly one quarter of the population of Istanbul at that time, with over 200,000 residents. Abandoned since 1915, the tenth-century Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross on Akhtamar Island underwent a controversial restoration in 2006, paid for by the Turkish Ministry of Culture. =Armenian‚ÄìTurkish relations during the decline of the Ottoman Empire= Hamidian rule For a half century leading up to World War I, the Armenian populations of Anatolia became increasingly politically active, and in turn endured increasingly more brutal persecution under Sultan Abdul Hamid II. As the Ottoman Empire declined, its political leadership either authorized or tolerated increasingly violent and reckless attacks on the Armenian population, attracting harsh criticism from various Western nations whose missionary communities in Anatolia witnessed several wide scale massacres of Armenians. From 1894 to 1896 the Sultan ordered the deaths of up to 300,000 Armenians, resulting in at least 50,000 Armenian orphans, in the Hamidian massacres, which were later described by BBC correspondent Chris Morris in The New Turkey (Granta Books, 2005) as \\"a portent of the grim events of 1915\\". Following the Hamidian massacres, the seizure of the Ottoman Bank by Armenian revolutionaries later that year, apparently a naive plea for Western intervention on behalf of the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire, contributed to stoking Hamidian persecution of Armenians. Those who stormed the bank were eventually granted safe passage out of the empire, but the Armenian population found itself subject to intensified violence as the sultan made no distinction between the revolutionaries who had stormed the bank and the Christian populations at large. The ensuing violence prompted condemnation from several heads of state, including American President Grover Cleveland, who condemned the \\"bloody butchery\\" in Anatolia. While it was unclear to what extent the violence against Armenians was governmentally organized, Cleveland's speech noted that \\"strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work of destruction and robbery.\\"Cleveland, Grover (1896-12-08) \\"MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT; Belief Expressed that Christendom Will Not Much Longer Tolerate Atrocities in Armenia.

Armenian national movement, also known as the \\"Armenian revolutionary movement\\", was the Armenian national effort to re-establish an Armenian state in the historic Armenian homelands of eastern Asia Minor and the Transcaucasus. The decline of the Ottoman Empire in part was the result and in part the cause of rise of nationalism among various groups that made up the multi-ethnic and multi-religion Empire. The Russo- Turkish War, which resulted in the independence of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, provided a model for other aspiring nationalists and revolutionaries. The Hinchak and Dashnak, Armenian revolutionary committees, were formed in Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire following the Berlin Treaty, which were very much under direct Russian threat.Louise Nalbandian, \\"The Armenian Revolutionary Movement\\", 1963 Yet, this is contrasted by F√¢'iz el-Ghusein, who stated, \\"I have enquired of many Armenians whom I have met, but I have not found one who said that he desired political independence.\\"el- Ghusein, F√¢'iz, Martyred Armenia, (George H. Doran Co., 1918), 3. Zaven, the Armenian Bishop in Istanbul had already declared, before the war started, to the reporter of Msak, the organ of the Armenian nationalist-liberals, that \\"the radical solution of the Armenian Question would be the unification of all Armenia (including the Eastern Anatolia of Turkey-M.P.) under Russian sovereignty with which Armenians' fate was historically linked.

Agitation for improvement of living conditions in the Ottoman Empire among Armenians had started much before the events of World War I, as reported in The New York Times, 1894, July 29: In 1894, Zeki Pasha, Commandant of the Fourth Army Corps, was decorated for his participation during the Sassoun massacre.Robert Melson, \\"Revolution and Genocide\\" (1992), 60.W.

The Armenian Genocide The Armenian Genocide was the forced deportation\\"Lord Bryce's report on Armenian atrocities an appalling catalogue of outrage and massacre\\", The New York Times, Lord Bryce on Armenian Atrocities Fashions Drama, Page X2, October 8, 1916. and extermination of the majority of the Ottoman Armenian population between 1915 and 1917, when between 800,000 to 1,500,000 (per the government of France) Armenians were killed.Bevan, Robert. \\"Cultural Cleansing: Who Remembers The Armenians\\", The Destruction of Memory, Reaction Books, London. 2006, pp. 25‚Äì60 According to Rafael de Nogales, Ottoman commander of the artillery at Van Resistance, \\"the Armenians‚Äô posture was defensive and in response to the massacres being committed in villages surrounding Van\\".Balakian, Peter, The Burning Tigris (New York: HarperCollins, 2003), 208. Also, Armenians were being forcibly relocated from Zeitun in March 1915, months before the Tehcir Law was passed.Hartunian, Abraham H., Neither to Laugh nor to Weep (Boston: Beacon Press, 1968), 54. Further massacres and deportations occurred during the closing stages and immediate aftermath of World War I. The modern Turkish government has always denied the fact that the massacres of the Armenians during the Ottoman period constituted genocide, inflaming Armenian resentment in Armenia and around the world.Balakian, Peter. The Burning Tigris In recent years the Armenian Genocide of 1915 has been increasingly discussed in Turkey, at conferences and universities, since the law does not prevent debates on the topic. Even though freedom of speech and freedom of thought are guaranteed by Turkish law due to the nature of Article 301, people claiming an Armenian Genocide can be accused of calling the nation \\"killers\\" and thus \\"insulting Turkishness\\".Bostom, Andrew G. (2007-08-26) \\"Congress Must Recognize the Armenian Genocide \\", American Thinker. Accessed 2008-08-15. Over eighty authors have faced prosecution for \\"insulting Turkishness\\"; Kemal Kerin√ßsiz, an ultra-nationalist lawyer, is responsible for at least forty of them, and his group B√ºy√ºk Hukuk√ßular Birliƒüi (\\"Great Union of Jurists\\" or \\"Turkish Lawyer's Union\\") for most of the rest. The Turkish educational system continues to mandate teaching of Armenian genocide denial in its public schools and through many of its governmental websites. First Republic of Armenia The 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk established three independent states in the Caucasus, including the First Republic of Armenia. Within two months of its signing, the Ottoman Empire reneged on the treaty by invading the nascent Armenian state, being stopped at the Battle of Sardarabad. The invasion culminated in the Treaty of Batum in June 1918. =The interwar period, and the Soviet era= The interwar period was marked by the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire; Anatolia became the Republic of Turkey in 1923. Turkish revolutionaries waged the Turkish War of Independence against Ottoman loyalists and neighboring countries, and engaged in continuing conflict with the Democratic Republic of Armenia. On September 24, 1920, Turkish forces invaded and advanced unto Sarighamish and Kars resulting in the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian War. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk sent delegations to Moscow; the DRA would ultimately become the Armenian SSR of the Soviet Union. The Treaty of Kars, identical to the previously concluded Russo-Turkish Treaty of Moscow, was signed on October 23, 1921, between the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and representatives of Bolshevist Russia, Soviet Armenia, Soviet Azerbaijan and Soviet Georgia (all of which formed part of the Soviet Union after the December 1922 Union Treaty). The Soviet Union and Turkey remained officially neutral after the Treaty of Kars, and there was no hostility between Turkey and the Armenian SSR. The land border was closed except for the Kars‚ÄìLeninakan railway. Capital tax and A≈ükale During World War II, an extremely high tax burden was imposed on Armenian, Greek and Jewish citizens of Turkey, and tax assessors had a free hand in determining the amount, often amounts that could not be paid. In the winter of 1942, hundreds who could not pay, including elderly men, were brought to the town of A≈ükale, with very harsh winters, and made to shovel snow continually for as much as five months. Some were able to pay locals to perform the labor for them, and some succumbed to the cold and conditions, sleeping in barns, coffeehouses, or anywhere else they could get shelter.Yalcin, Kemal. \\"You Rejoice My Heart\\", Gomidas Institute, London. 2007, pp. 78‚Äì89 The book \\"You Rejoice My Heart\\" by Turkish author Kemal Yal√ßƒ±n includes a visit by the author to A≈ükale in the 1990s to learn first hand about the tax and the labor camps, the conditions and the victims at a time when this incident was dangerous and taboo to discuss in Turkey.Yal√ßƒ±n, Kemal. You Rejoice My Heart Istanbul Pogrom The Istanbul Pogrom was launched in Turkey against ethnic minorities residing in Istanbul, in particular Greeks and Armenians during the year September 1955.Speros Vryonis, The Mechanism of Catastrophe: The Turkish Pogrom of September 6‚Äì7, 1955, and the Destruction of the Greek Community of Istanbul, New York: Greekworks.com 2005, Paramilitary activity ASALA, the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia, was a Marxist-Leninist organization of Lebanese extraction, that operated from 1975 to 1991.Hayutyan, Vasn. \\"Vasn Hayrenyats\\", ASALA, 1995 In the 1980s it launched a series of assassinations against Turkish diplomats in several countries, with the stated intention to compel the Turkish Government to acknowledge its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, pay reparations, and cede territory. The territorial claim related to the 1920 Treaty of S√®vres and a Woodrow Wilson- era plan for an Armenian homeland. The group planned attacks worldwide, though it experienced internal splintering after its 1983 Orly Airport attack incurred non-Turkish casualties. The attacks, which were routinely condemned by Armenian church leaders, as well as the international community, were famously protested by an Armenian named Artin Penik in 1982, who self- immolated in Istanbul's Taksim Square to demonstrate the force of his opposition to ASALA tactics. The Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who visited the badly burned Penik in the hospital shortly before his death, described him as \\"a symbol of Armenian discontent with these brutal murders.\\" A similar organization, Justice Commandos against the Armenian Genocide, at times known as the Armenian Revolutionary Army, was responsible for at least an additional six killings. In the 1983 Turkish embassy attack in Lisbon, gunmen deliberately \\"sacrificed\\" themselves by setting off a bomb in the building, such that none of them survived. Amidst a spate of attacks in 1985, U.S. President Ronald Reagan asked Congress to defeat a resolution recognizing the \\"genocidal massacre\\" of Armenians, in part for his fear that it might indirectly \\"reward terrorism\\". According to the MIPT website, there had been 84 incidents involving ASALA leaving 46 people dead, and 299 people injured. Modern relations =Armenian independence 1991= The Khor Virap monastery, which dates to the 7th century, lies on the closed Turkish-Armenian border. Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia's independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ankara, however, refused to establish diplomatic relations with Yerevan, as well as to launch the two Turkish-Armenian border gates, such as Alijan ‚Äì Margaran and Dogukap ‚Äì Akhurik. Turkey put forward two preconditions: Armenia must recognize the Turkish-Armenian border, which was established under the Treaty of Kars in 1921, that is, waive territorial claims, as well as put an end to the process of international recognition of the Armenian Genocide. =Diplomatic freeze= Nagorno-Karabakh War Turkey was an active member of the OSCE Minsk Group created in 1992 by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to mediate an end to the conflict between Armenia and Turkey's ally Azerbaijan over the disputed autonomous oblast of Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been raging since the oblast's parliament had voted to unify with Armenia on February 20, 1988, but the group made little progress and full-scale fighting quickly re- erupted. Armenia‚ÄìTurkey relations gradually worsened as the Armenian military continued to make gains in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and the May 9, 1992 capture of Shusha by the Armenians resulted in Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel coming under intense public pressure to intervene. Demirel opposed such intervention, saying that Turkey's entrance into the war would trigger an even greater Muslim‚ÄìChristian conflict. Turkey did not send troops to aid Azerbaijan, but provided Azerbaijan with military aid and advisors. Subsequent ethnic cleansing of Nagorno-Karabakh of all of its Azerbaijani population which culminated in the Khojaly Massacre in February 1992 and of the ethnic cleansing of Armenians living in other regions of Azerbaijan, as was the case during the Baku Pogrom, further aggravated relations, which have never really recovered. United Nations Security Council Resolution 822 Turkey cosponsored UN Security Council Resolution 822 affirming Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and demanding that Armenian forces withdraw from Kelbajar. Later in 1993 Turkey joined Azerbaijan in imposing an economic embargo on Armenia and the border between the two states was closed.William M. Hale. Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774‚Äì2000, Routledge, 2000, , p. 273 In mid-August, 1993, Armenians massed a force to take the Azeri regions of Fizuli and Jebrail, south of Nagorno-Karabakh proper and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu √áiller responded by sending thousands of Turkish troops to the border and demanding that Armenia pull out of Azerbaijan's territories. Russian Federation forces in Armenia however countered their movements and thus warded off any possibility that Turkey might play a military role in the conflict. Memories of the Armenian Genocide were re-awoken during the conflict by claims of ethnic cleansing and in November 1993 American historian Bernard Lewis entered the debate by saying in an interview that calling the massacres committed by the Turks in 1915 a genocide was just \\"the Armenian version of this history\\".\\"... que la qualification de g√©nocide, attribu√©e aux massacres perp√©tr√©s par les Turcs en 1915, n'√©tait que 'la version arm√©nienne de cette histoire.'\\" Herzberg, Nathaniel. Bernard Lewis condamn√© pour avoir ni√© la r√©alit√© du g√©nocide arm√©nien (\\"Bernard Lewis Censured For Having Denied the Reality of the Armenian Genocide\\"), Le Monde, p. 11, June 23, 1995: Copy of article on private website . He was subsequently prosecuted and fined by French authorities for the comment.Civil judgment finding Lewis at fault, 21 June 1995 ; English-language translation of judgment on private website . Ongoing blockade Turkey does not recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (Republic of Artsakh) that has emerged from the May 16, 1994, Russian mediated cease-fire to the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and has set Armenian withdrawal from the disputed oblast and seven surrounding districts as a precondition for establishing diplomatic relations and reopening their joint border.Gerard J. Libaridian. Modern Armenia: People, Nation, State, Transaction Publishers, 2004, , p. 245 Armenia claims that Turkey has used the ongoing blockade that resulted from the unresolved Nagorno-Karabakh conflict to isolate the country with projects such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum natural gas pipeline and the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku railway, all of which directly bypass Armenia despite the economic logic of incorporating Armenia. A rail line from Kars to Baku already existed in fact, but had been closed by Turkey, as it passes through the closed Turkey‚ÄìArmenia border. Armenia, which has no coal, natural gas or oil of its own and scant wind and water resources, had long been suffering from severe energy shortages and now blockaded by neighbouring Turkey and Azerbaijan, from whom it used to import nearly all its fuel, was forced to announce that it would restart the second of two VVER reactors in the Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant. Armenian Environmental Committee Chairman Samuel Shahinian explained the decision; \\"Our people are so cold we cannot explain anything to them, they just want to be warm.\\" The reactors, which had been commissioned by the Soviet authorities in 1979 and had long been considered dangerously out-of-date, were shut down in 1988 over safety concerns following the nearby Spitak earthquake. The announcement prompted uproar in Turkey whose border is just 17 km from Metsamor. \\"There are certain risks\\", confirmed Armenian Deputy Speaker Ara Sahakian, \\"but we should realise and everyone should realise we have no other choice.\\" Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant Metsamor re-commissioning Metsamor unit-2 was recommissioned in 1995 after an estimated $50m had been spent on safety improvements but this did little to alleviate safety concerns in Turkey and the Turkish Atomic Energy Agency (TAEK) along with the Turkish Environment and Forestry Ministry, Kafkas University and various institutes and foundations formed a tight infrastructure of control in the region across the border from the reactor and set up the RESAI early warning system to take constant measurements of airborne gamma radiation levels and sample analyses of local soil, plant, and food to give advance warning when levels rise above threshold limits. TAEK Deputy Chairman Dr. Erdener Birol confirms, \\"As the radiation level increases, Ankara is notified about it immediately.\\" Further safety concerns arose when it was revealed that the ongoing blockade of the country by its neighbours Turkey and Azerbaijan meant that nuclear fuel for the plant was flown onboard Antonov and Tupolev airplanes from Russia into Yerevan Airport in secret shipments which Alexis Louber, Head of the EU delegation in Yerevan, likened to \\"flying around a potential nuclear bomb.\\" Elie Wiesel affirmation of the Armenian Genocide On June 9, 2000, in a full-page statement in The New York Times, 126 scholars, including Nobel Prize-winner Elie Wiesel, historian Yehuda Bauer, and sociologist Irving Horowitz, signed a document \\"affirming that the World War I Armenian Genocide is an incontestable historical fact and accordingly urge the governments of Western democracies to likewise recognize it as such.\\"Armenian Genocide denial: The case against Turkey, By Alan S. Rosenbaum, Jewish News, 2007 According to Stephen Kinzer the reshaping of the national consciousness in the first years of the new century \\"allowed [the Turks] to open their minds to alternative views of the 1915 tragedy,\\" and, \\"more than a dozen books touching on this subject were published in Turkey, bearing titles like Armenians in Our Neighbourhood and The Armenian Taboo.\\"  ALTAY operation  According to the news website Nordic Monitor, Turkey planned a military invasion of Armenia code-named ALTAY. The operation plan was finalized in 2001. Details leaked in 2019, when it was also mentioned that the plan is still valid. Metsamor deadline Shortly after Armenia became a member of the Council of Europe in 2001 authorities in Yerevan stated that they expected EU assistance in the construction of a gas pipeline linking Armenia to neighbouring Iran and in the lifting of Turkish and Azerbaijani blockade. Armenian Deputy Energy Minister Areg Galstyan indicated that the plant, which provides 40 per cent of Armenia's energy and sells excess power to neighbouring Georgia, should remain running until 2016 and possibly 2031 as, \\"It was a big mistake to shut the plant in 1988; it created an energy crisis and the people and the economy suffered. It is impossible for the government to cause the same problem again by closing the plant.\\" Professor Hayrettin Kilic of Ferrara University speaking at a conference jointly organised by the Kars City Council and Kafkas University responded that, \\"The risk is tremendous. Metsamor nuclear power plant is not a problem of Kars, Aƒürƒ±, Igdir, Yerevan and Nakhichevan but a problem of Turkey, Georgia and all Armenia. This is a regional problem.\\" Igdir Mayor Nurettin Aras stated, \\"We are in danger of a disaster. We will apply for the closing down of the nuclear plant,\\" and Kars Mayor Naif Alibeyoglu confirmed that, \\"We are doing everything to close this plant, but not everything is in our power. It is essential that state authorities attend to this matter closely,\\" and, \\"The Turkish government should start an initiative for the closure of the plant. Both Turkish and Armenian people should be aware of danger.\\" Galstyan dismissed safety concerns stating that it is more important to Armenians \\"to keep the electricity on,\\" whilst Jeremy Page, writing in The Times pointed out that, \\"The mostly Christian nation is also reluctant to rely on imported energy because of its history of hostility with its Islamic neighbours.\\" A final agreement had been achieved with the EU and other involved international organisations to prolong the exploitation of the plant at least until 2016. Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission The Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission was launched on 9 July 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland with ten individuals from Armenia, Turkey, Russia, and the United States mostly consisting of former high-ranking politicians renowned for their past achievements who aimed \\"to promote mutual understanding and goodwill between Turks and Armenians and to encourage improved relations.\\" Armenian Assembly of America (AAA) Chairman Harair Hovnanian stated, \\"This is the first multi-disciplinary, comprehensive attempt to reconcile differences between two neighbors, separated by bitterness and mistrust, and as such, it is a major advance\\", and AAA President Carolyn Mugar added, \\"We believe that the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission will benefit and build on the experiences of other similar international efforts.\\" AK Party comes to power in Turkey The Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in Turkey, following the 2002 Turkish general election, under Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and Abdullah G√ºl with a foreign policy formulated by Ahmet Davutoƒülu that postulated \\"zero problems with neighbours\\" leading to new hope for Armenian‚ÄìTurkish relations. Restrictions on Armenians entering Turkey had been lifted in January 2002, and although the border between the two countries remained closed, Armenian workers were reportedly entering the country via Georgia and remaining illegally after their 30-day non-resident visa expired. An undeclared official Turkish policy developed to keep the illegal immigrants relatively comfortable with Turkish Prime Minister Erdoƒüan later announcing, \\"they could not sustain themselves in their homeland, and we opened our doors. We could deport them but we are not doing so.\\" Gazi University professor Mehmet Seyfettin Erol confirmed that, \\"This is soft power for Turkey,\\" of the policy credited with improving bilateral relations, \\"Treating them as ‚Äòothers‚Äô does not serve any purpose and it will in all likelihood push Armenians away from Turkey.\\" The International Center for Transitional Justice was asked by the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission to provide a report on the applicability of the Genocide Convention to the controversy. This report ruled that the term \\"genocide\\" aptly describes \\"the Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915‚Äì1918\\", but added, in an effort to ease adverse Turkish reaction, that the modern Republic of Turkey was not legally liable for the event. The issue of Turkey‚Ä≤s accession to EU Some European Union politicians pressured Turkey into formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide as a precondition for joining the EU.Danielyan, Emil (2005-06-03) \\"Turkey, Armenia Miss Opportunity for Rapprochement\\", Eurasia Insight These efforts to exploit Turkey's vulnerability in its attempted accession into the EU have been widely criticized within Turkey. Among the fiercest critics of this method of pressuring Turkey was the late Hrant Dink, who accused Angela Merkel of sponsoring legislation acknowledging the Armenian Genocide to undermine Turkey's EU ambitions. Dink suggested that anyone sincerely interested in the welfare of the Armenian and Turkish peoples would sooner pressure Yerevan to finally replace the Metsamor reactor, or press Turkey to finally open the Armenian‚ÄìTurkish border, or even just generally \\"help economically and diplomatically and support the moderates who exist on both sides.\\" According to former Armenian President Robert Kocharyan, \\"Armenia has never been against Turkey's accession to the European Union.\\"Tapan, Noyan (2006-06-20). \\"House Members Call On Eu To Encourage Turkey Reform And Recognition Of Genocide, ArmeniaDiaspora.Com Armenia itself is a member of the EU's New Neighborhood group, which may one day lead to EU membership. Former Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan, while conceding that \\"genocide denial hurts\\", insists that the Turkish viewpoint does not necessarily \\"impede the normalization of our relations\\". As of 2005 Turkey opened its airspace to Armenia in a limited capacity with the resumption of Armavia flights between Yerevan and Istanbul; land trade however continued to be diverted through Georgia. Proposed joint historical commission on events of 1915 In 2005 a group of Turkish scholars and opinion makers held an academic conference at which, it was vowed, all points of view about the Armenian massacre would be respectfully heard. According to Stephen Kinzer, \\"Some commentators objected to parts of what was said at the conference, but nearly all welcomed the breakthrough to open debate on this painful subject.\\" The International Association of Genocide Scholars affirmed that scholarly evidence revealed the \\"Young Turk government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its Armenian citizens ‚Äì an unarmed Christian minority population. More than a million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation, torture, and forced death marches\\" and condemned Turkish attempts to deny its factual and moral reality. The idea of the establishment of a joint commission composed of historians from Turkey and Armenia, which would examine both countries‚Ä≤ national archives and disclose the findings of their research to the international public was approved by the Turkish Grand National Assembly. However, the Armenian president's letter as of April 2005 to prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said, In 2006, after years of campaigning by French citizens of Armenian descent, the French National Assembly, in what Stephen Kinzer calls \\"an astonishing victory\\" officially declared that Ottoman Turks committed genocide in 1915, and voted it a crime for anyone to assert otherwise. In February 2007, Armenia's president Robert Kocharian while on a visit to France said that the \\"normalization of bilateral relations is the responsibility of governments, not historians.\\" In April 2015, Armenia's president Serzh Sargsyan said \\"It becomes obvious that the Turkish proposal of establishing the so-called commission of historians has only one goal, which is to delay the process of the Armenian Genocide recognition, and divert the attention of international community from that crime. That is not only our view but also the view of the international community that goes on recognizing and condemning the Armenian Genocide.\\" =Post-2007 diplomatic thaw= Hrant Dink assassination The January 2007 assassination of Hrant Dink, a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, brought the issue of Armenian‚ÄìTurkish relations into the national consciousness of modern Turkish citizens. Dink was instrumental in getting Turks to discuss the Armenian Genocide, an effort for which he found himself the target of criminal prosecution on three separate occasions. Nonetheless, Dink also reserved some criticism for the Armenian diaspora, for its insistence on enforcing a claim of genocide without engaging the modern Turkish people. Shortly after the arrest of Og√ºn Samast, the 17-year-old nationalist suspected in the murder, pictures surfaced of the assassin flanked by smiling Turkish police and gendarmerie, who were posing with the killer in front of the Turkish flag while he was in police custody. The pictures triggered a spate of investigations and the removal from office of those involved. At Hrant Dink's funeral, tens of thousands of Turkish citizens marched in solidarity with Dink, many bearing placards reading \\"We are all Hrant Dink, we are all Armenians\\" sounding a hopeful note in the development of Armenian‚ÄìTurkish relations. Nobel Laureate genocide re-affirmation In 2007, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity produced a letter signed by 53 Nobel Laureates re-affirming the Genocide Scholars' conclusion that the 1915 killings of Armenians constituted genocide. Then Turkish Foreign Minister, Abdullah G√ºl, responded by reaffirming calls for a committee of Turkish and Armenian historians to re-examine the events of 1915, as first suggested in 2005, but Armenians showed no interest in the suggestion with a 2007 public opinion survey quoted by Stephen Kinzer indicating that, \\"only 3 percent of Armenians believe that forcing Turkey to admit genocide should be their government's top priority,\\" and, \\"Only 4 percent even placed it on their list of priorities.\\" Efforts by Americans of Armenian descent to have the US Congress pass a resolution recognising the Armenian Genocide, however, continued through what Stephen Kinzer calls \\"their superbly effective lobby in Washington\\" and \\"almost passed the House of Representatives in 2007, thanks to the influence of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, in whose home state of California many prosperous Armenian-Americans live,\\" until Condoleezza Rice and Robert M. Gates signed an open letter to Congress, warning that formally recognizing the Armenian Genocide \\"could harm American troops in the field\\" by \\"antagonizing\\" Turkey. Metsamor replacement On September 7, 2007, Armenian Energy Minister Armen Movsisyan announced that Metsamor unit-2 was to be replaced with a new nuclear power plant built on the same site at a cost of $2 billion. \\"The project's feasibility study is being carried out by Armenia, Russia, the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The old nuclear power plant is to be rebuilt within four-and-a-half years\\", he stated, clarifying that \\"many foreign countries now understand that Armenia must have a nuclear power plant.\\" TAEK, which had recently denied claims in Today's Zaman that its latest protest to the IAEA was made in response to the RESAI early warning system indicating \\"an increase in radioactive leakage in the region,\\" stating, \\"None of the radioactivity analyses or RESAI station measurements done up until now have uncovered radioactivity or radiation levels above normal,\\" confirmed that it would be involved in following related developments and taking the necessary precautions from the Turkish side. 2008 Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day On April 24, 2008, during Armenia's annual Genocide Remembrance Day, a Turkish flag was stomped on during an official demonstration in Yerevan. The Turkish Foreign Ministry reacted by issuing the statement: \\"With the meaning that it carries, the Turkish flag symbolizes freedom and all the fundamental values and beliefs of the Turkish nation. The flag is accepted as synonymous with our nation's existence. The importance attributed by the Turkish nation to these values and its flag is widely known. In this regard, the related news reports led to great sadness, upset and indignation in our society.\\" 2008‚Äì2009 Georgia‚ÄìRussia crisis Following the 2008 South Ossetia war, which prompted concerns over stability of energy routes in the Caucasus, normalisation of ties with Armenia became a priority for the Turkish government. =Attempted rapprochement= Turkish Presidential visit to Armenia and subsequent negotiations In September 2008, Turkish President Abdullah G√ºl became the first Turkish head of state to visit Armenia after he accepted the invitation of Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan to attend a FIFA World Cup qualifier football match between the Turkish and Armenian national football teams. Talks during the game focused on bilateral relations and Karabakh, and did not touch upon the Armenian Genocide, though Foreign Minister Ali Babacan raised the issue soon afterward. Both of the presidents and their countries‚Äô respective press reflected positively on the visit setting the ground for a thaw in diplomatic relations that was expected to have made great progress in time for Sargsyan's reciprocal visit to Turkey in October to watch the return match. On the eve of the 2009 US presidential visit to Turkey by Barack Obama sources in Ankara and Yerevan announced that a deal might soon be struck to reopen the border between the two states and exchange diplomatic personnel. A research conducted on the Armenia-Turkey border reopening has shown that closed borders between Armenia and its neighboring countries have a negative impact on the Armenian economy. It is not argued that a re-opening of the borders (especially with Turkey) will bring many benefits to the Armenian economy. Armenian Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan confirmed, \\"Turkey and Armenia have gone a long way toward opening the Turkey-Armenia border, and they will come closer to opening it soon,\\" but dismissed any connection to the Nagorno- Karabakh dispute. The International Crisis Group (ICG) issued a report on the normalisation stating, \\"The politicized debate whether to recognize as genocide the destruction of much of the Ottoman Armenian population and the stalemated Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh should not halt momentum.\\" Stating that whilst, \\"The unresolved Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh still risks undermining full adoption and implementation of the potential package deal between Turkey and Armenia\\", the, \\"Bilateral d√©tente with Armenia ultimately could help Baku recover territory better than the current stalemate.\\" Announcement of provisional roadmap and reactions On 22 April 2009, it was announced that high-level diplomatic talks underway in Switzerland since 2007 \\"had achieved tangible progress and mutual understanding,\\" and that \\"a road map has been identified,\\" for normalizing diplomatic relations between the two countries, although no formal text had yet been signed. Today's Zaman concluded that the cautious approach by Turkish authorities was intended to minimise criticism from Azerbaijan and nationalist Turks who would complain of \\"submission to Western pressure\\" but went on to quote an unnamed Western diplomat who speaking to Reuters confirmed that, \\"All the documents have been agreed in principle,\\" and that, \\"We are talking about weeks or months.\\" The Armenian Dashnak Party responded to the announcement in an April 26 closed-door meeting with a decision to withdraw its 16 deputies, who held three ministries in the Armenian Cabinet, from the coalition government. Reaction to the announcement within Turkey was more muted with opposition MHP leader Bah√ßeli complaining that, \\"Armenia knows what is going on; Switzerland knows what is going on; Turkish officials involved in the process know. That means the Turkish nation and Parliament are the only ones who have no information about the process,\\" before going on to conclude that, \\"It would be beneficial if the prime minister or the minister for foreign affairs would inform Parliament. We will follow developments, but for the moment we don‚Äôt know the depth of the agreement. Taking the explanations made so far into account, we are monitoring whether any further steps are being taken in the issue of opening the border.\\" International reaction to the announcement was positive, despite concerns that adverse reaction from Azerbaijan could affect European energy security. United States statements on Armenian Remembrance Day The 2009 statement by U.S. President Barack Obama on Armenian Remembrance Day claimed that, \\"reckoning with the past holds out a powerful promise of reconciliation,\\" before going on to state that, \\"the best way to advance that goal right now is for the Armenian and Turkish people to address the facts of the past as part of their effort to move forward,\\" and reaffirming his strong support for \\"efforts by the Turkish and Armenian people to work through this painful history in a way that is honest open and constructive,\\" but although, as previously indicated, US President Obama did not use the word ‚Äògenocide‚Äô his use of the Armenian term Meds Yeghern, translated as \\"Great Crime\\" or \\"Calamity\\", managed to offend both sides of the dispute. Armenian groups felt betrayed at the reversal of promises of recognition made during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election whist Turkish authorities felt that Obama had gone back on promises made during the recent 2009 US presidential visit to Turkey. Despite not saying the word genocide, Obama made it clear that he had not changed his views about the Armenian Genocide in the statement, saying \\"I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view of that history has not changed.\\" Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan said, \\"Turkey is not a country that can be flattered and then fooled,\\" before going on to conclude that, \\"Turkish- Armenian relations will be normalised, historical matters will be enlightened and the road will be paved for peace if countries that have nothing to do with the issue stop getting involved.\\" Turkish opposition leaders were equally critical with MHP leader Bah√ßeli stating, \\"Looking at the entire statement, one will see that it is unacceptable,\\" and, \\"If the U.S. sacrifices Turkey for the sake of Armenian votes, everyone, including most notably Armenia, will have to suffer the consequences,\\" and CHP leader Baykal clarifying that, \\"Obama's statement shows that efforts to please outsiders by giving concessions are not yielding any result, and we have managed to alienate Azerbaijan, too.\\" 2009 Turkish Presidential visit to Azerbaijan and Russia Armenian authorities responded to comments made by Turkish Prime Minister Erdoƒüan during his official visit to Baku that, \\"There is a relation of cause and effect here. The occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh is the cause, and the closure of the border is the effect. Without the occupation ending, the gates will not be opened,\\" with a statement from the office of Armenian President Sarksyan that read, \\"The president said that, as he repeatedly pointed out during Armenian-Turkish contacts, any Turkish attempt to interfere in the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem can only harm that process.\\" Armenian Foreign Minister Nalbandian reiterated that, \\"Concerning the Armenian-Turkish normalisation process, over the past year, following the initiative of the Armenian President together with our Turkish neighbours and with the help of our Swiss partners, we have advanced toward opening one of the last closed borders in Europe and the normalisation of our relations without preconditions. The ball is on the Turkish side now. And we hope that they will find the wisdom and the courage to make the last decisive step. We wish to be confident that the necessary political will can eventually leave behind the mentality of the past.\\" Erdoƒüan flew on from Baku to Sochi, Russia, for a 16 May \\"working visit\\" with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at which he stated, \\"Turkey and Russia have responsibilities in the region. We have to take steps for the peace and well being of the region. This includes the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, the Middle East dispute, the Cyprus problem.\\" Putin responded that, \\"Russia and Turkey seek for such problems to be resolved and will facilitate this in every way,\\" but, \\"As for difficult problems from the past‚Äìand the Karabakh problem is among such issues-a compromise should be found by the participants in the conflict. Other states which help reach a compromise in this aspect can play a role of mediators and guarantors to implement the signed agreements.\\" 2009 signing of accord Nalbandyan and Davutoglu signing the accord An accord between Armenia and Turkey was signed by the foreign ministers of the two countries, Ahmet Davutoƒülu and Eduard Nalbandyan, on 10 October 2009. The signing took place in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Armenians worldwide had protested against the deal because of the controversial concessions that the Armenian leadership was preparing to make, most notably in regards to the Armenian genocide and the Turkish-Armenian border. The deal followed more than one year of talks. It was designed to allow the opening of borders and to set up a formal diplomatic relationship. The signing was attended by Bernard Kouchner, Sergey Lavrov and Hillary Clinton, the foreign ministers of France, Russia and the United States, respectively. Suspension of the ratification process Those diplomatic efforts to normalise the relations initiated by Armenia eventually faltered. In Armenia, before sending the protocols to the parliament, it was send to the Constitutional Court to have their constitutionality to be approved. The Constitutional Court made references to the preamble of the protocols underlying three main issues. One of them stated that the implementation of the protocols did not imply Armenia‚Äôs official recognition of the existing Turkish-Armenian border established by the Treaty of Kars. By doing so, the Constitutional Court rejected one of the main premises of the protocols, i.e. ‚Äúthe mutual recognition of the existing border between the two countries as defined by relevant treaties of international law\\". This was regarded by the Turkish Government as effectively revising the protocols and thus the reason to back down from the process. The ruling Armenian coalition decided to propose a suspension of the ratification process to the president after the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan announced multiple times that the Turkish ratification depended on a peace deal in Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. On the same day President Sargsyan suspended the ratification process although announcing, that Armenia does not suspend the process of normalisation of relationships with Turkey as a whole. =Events after the failed thaw=  Possible territorial claims by Armenia On July 5, 2013, during a forum of Armenian lawyers in Yerevan on the 100th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide organized by the Ministry of Diaspora, Armenia's Prosecutor General Aghvan Hovsepyan made a \\"sensational statement\\". Hovsepyan stated: According to ArmeniaNow news agency \\"this was seen as the first territorial claim of Armenia to Turkey made on an official level. The prosecutor general is the carrier of the highest legal authority in the country, and his statement is equivalent to an official statement.\\" In response, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on July 12, 2013: During his visit to Baku on July 17, 2013, Turkish Foreign Affairs Minister Ahmed Davutoglu described Armenian land claims as \\"product of delirium.\\" Since 2015 The signing, on 23 December 2015, by Russian defence minister Sergei Shoygu and his Armenian counterpart Seyran Ohanyan of an agreement to form a Joint Air Defense System in the CaucasusRussia, Armenia unite air defenses, create regional system in the Caucasus RT, 23 December 2015. that followed the Armenian minister's statement that the ceasefire with Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh virtually no longer existed, provoked concern on the part of Turkey's government. The Armenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a statement which condemned the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, \\"which would lead to deterioration of regional security, losses among civilians, mass displacement and eventually to a new humanitarian crisis.\\" Outstanding issues =Armenian Genocide denial= Tensions stemming from the Armenian Genocide, the systematic murder of an estimated 1,500,000 Armenians by the authorities of the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, are a bitter point of contention, with most historians defining the killings as a genocide,Ferguson, Niall. The War of the World: Twentieth- Century Conflict and the Descent of the West. New York: Penguin Press, 2006 p. 177 A Letter from The International Association of Genocide Scholars June 13, 2005 a term whose applicability the Turkish state rejects.The Psychological Satisfaction of Denials of the Holocaust or Other Genocides by Non-Extremists or Bigots, and Even by Known Scholars , by Israel Charny, \\"IDEA\\" journal, July 17, 2001, Vol.6, no.1 Most historians maintain that it was a deliberate and intentional attempt to exterminate the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire. This view is also the position of the Republic of Armenia.Letter from the International Association of Genocide Scholars to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, June 13, 2005Kamiya, Gary. Genocide: An inconvenient truth. Salon.com. October 16, 2007.Jaschik, Scott. Genocide Deniers. History News Network. October 10, 2007. The Republic of Turkey rejects the 1.5 million figure for the final death toll, insisting that the deaths were closer to the range of 200,000‚Äì300,000, and insists that they were the result of disease, famine and inter-ethnic strife during the turmoil of World War I, saying that the Armenian Dashnak and Henchak rebels had sided with the Russian Army which invaded eastern Anatolia during the war and committed massacres against the local Muslim population (Turks and Kurds) in that area. Merely to speak of the Armenian Genocide in Turkey is to risk \\"insulting Turkishness\\", a criminal offense for which various Turkish intelligentsia have been brought to trial, as mentioning the word genocide itself infers its occurrence. In response to Turkey's calls for a further impartial study, Israel Charny and the International Association of Genocide Scholars responded in an open letter to the Turkish prime minister, Numerous international organizations have conducted studies of the events, each in turn determining that the term \\"genocide\\" aptly describes \\"the Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915‚Äì1916.\\" Among the organizations asserting this conclusion are the International Center for Transitional Justice, the International Association of Genocide Scholars,Letter to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , International Association Of Genocide Scholars, 2005-06-13 and the United Nations' Sub- Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. Several nations and U.S. states, have passed formal legislative condemnations of the Armenian Genocide, despite intense Turkish diplomatic and economic pressure.\\"Turkey Recalls Envoys Over Armenian Genocide \\", International Center for Transitional Justice Switzerland has adopted laws that punish genocide denial. =Border dispute= Mount Ararat was in ancient and medieval times at the center of Armenia. Today, it is located in Turkey, though still towering over the Armenian capital of Yerevan. Armenia-Turkey border, Ani, Shirak Province. In the post-Soviet climate of irredentism, Turkey was particularly wary of hard-line Armenian sentiment laying claim to the territory of \\"Historic Armenia\\" within Turkey. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation, an Armenian political party, continues to insist on a reversion towards the Treaty of S√®vres territorial boundaries. After the Ottoman Empire signed the treaty, it was rejected by Turkey after it succeeded in the Turkish War of Independence and succeeded the empire.Current History, Volume 13, New York Times Co., 1921, \\"Dividing the Former Turkish Empire\\" pp. 441-444 (retrieved October 26, 2010) Armenia has officially stated that it has always recognised the current border with Turkey and, in the words of its former Foreign Minister Vardan Oskanyan, \\"Armenia has never made a problem of validity of the Treaty of Kars, as Armenia remains loyal to all agreements inherited from the Soviet Union.\\"\\"In Vartan Oskanian's Words, Turkey Casts Doubt on Treaty of Kars with Its Actions\\" These ongoing border disputes threatened to derail the negotiations between Armenia and Turkey prior to the announcement of the provisional road map in April 2009 with a group of Azerbaijani journalists reportedly refused permission to travel to Turkey to view renovation work on the border gate and Turkish journalist Servet Yanatma and four colleagues later being detained by Armenian authorities after attempting to film the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian border without permission. Yanatma, writing in the English- language Today's Zaman, however states that they were treated cordially and released after two hours and quotes an unnamed official as confirming that Armenia would adhere to the 1921 Treaty of Kars and renounce any territorial claims implicit in the national constitution's description of the Turkish territory of Eastern Anatolia as Western Armenia with the statement, \\"We are talking about the opening of a border. Can a border be opened if it is not recognized?\\" It was in response to this issue following the announcement that the Dashnak Party decided to withdraw from the coalition government feeling that renunciation of Armenian territorial claims would be an unacceptably radical change in the country's foreign policy.

The commercials starred a piece of pizza named Pizza Head, who had a face made out of different toppings and his pizza cutter nemesis named Steve who would try to cause him as much harm as possible. These advertising campaigns were from San Francisco's Goodby Silverstein & Partners were directed by Walter Williams in a style similar to his \\"The Mr. Bill Show\\", an early series of Saturday Night Live skits. A normal commercial would begin with Pizza Head saying something about the promotion, then Steve would somehow get involved demonstrating the promotion, with the help of an offscreen narrator.

Each commercial would open with a picture of a Pizza Hut restaurant having the words \\"The Pizza Head Show\\" appear over the picture. Pizza Head then would appear, talk to the audience, and get into a jam. The host of the commercials was a voice represented by a hand (similar to \\"Mr. Hands\\" from the Mr. Bill shorts). The hand would say \\"Hey Pizza Head, here's your friend, ...\\" as in \\"Hey Pizza Head, here's your friend, Doctor Steve\\" or \\"Hey Pizza Head, here's your friend, Coach Steve\\". Similar to Mr. Bill, when he saw his nemesis, Sluggo, Pizza Head would respond with \\"Oh, that's great! Wait a minute, he's not a real (Doctor, Coach, etc.)\\" and then would identify Steve through Steve's disguise. The hand would reassure Pizza Head (\\"Sure he is!\\"), but Steve then would humorously harm Pizza Head (i.e. hitting Pizza Head with a meteor or dropping him from an airplane). Some of the commercials ended with the destruction of a model of a Pizza Hut restaurant typically by whatever harmed Pizza Head. The narrator would then say, \\"See ya next time!\\" then followed by a promotion sometimes announced. The commercials ran from 1993 to 1997.

It consists of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County and the Philadelphia Municipal Court. Although the title of the district is assigned by the Pennsylvania Unified Court System, the court operates under the county of Philadelphia. All judges serving on the bench are elected to serve their terms by registered voters in Philadelphia, rather than appointed by the executive branch of government. The First Judicial District's respective courts preside over all state and local jurisdiction civil and criminal matters that occur within the county of Philadelphia's borders. Court of Common Pleas The Court of Common Pleas is led by a President Judge and Administrative Judges, Common Pleas is further broken down into three divisions: trial, family and orphans' court division. As of March 2019, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas is the Honorable Idee Fox, and the current trial division Administrative Judge is the Honorable Jacqueline F. Allen. There are 70 commissioned judges in the trial division, supplemented by senior judges. Of the commissioned judges, 41 sit in the criminal section of trial division and 29 sit in the civil section of the trial division. The civil and criminal sections each have their own supervising judge (being, respectively, the Honorable Arnold New and the Honorable Leon Tucker as of March 2019). The family division is broken down into the Juvenile Branch and Domestic Relations, and has 25 assigned judges. The family division has its own Administrative Judge and Supervising Judge (being the Honorable Margaret T. Murphy and the Honorable Walter J. Olszewksi as of March 2019). As of March 2019, there are four judges assigned to the Orphan's Court Division, including its own Administrative Judge (the Honorable Matthew D. Carrafiello). Through a 1999 Order of then Administrative Judge John Herron, the Commerce Case Management Program was created within the trial division's civil section, effective January 1, 2000. The program is generally known as the Commerce Court. It is a specialized Business Court hearing only business and commercial cases that fall within specifically defined categories. There are three assigned civil section judges who exclusively hear Commerce Court cases, one of whom serves as the Commerce Court's Supervising Judge (the Honorable Gary Glazer as of March 2019). The Commerce Court has three case tracks: (1) Expedited (trial in 13 months); (2) Standard (trial in 18 months); and Complex (trial in 24 months). Since the Commerce Court's inception, its design has required that opposing counsel, and often the litigants themselves, participate in mandatory settlement conferences facilitated by Judges Pro Tempore (JPTs). These JPTs are not judges, but seasoned commercial and business lawyers with training or experience as mediators and neutrals. The Commerce Court or the Philadelphia Bar Association‚Äôs Business Law Section, Business Litigation Committee can nominate JPTs. The Commerce Court has also posted over 1,000 judicial opinions on its website since 2000. In providing guidance to litigants and their lawyers, the Commerce Court makes these opinions searchable by topic as well. The trial division holds all criminal proceedings, as well as proceedings for civil matters where more than $10,000 is being challenged. The family division is discharged with resolving domestic relations and juvenile cases. The orphans' court is responsible for processing and resolving disputes of, trusts, wills, and estates. The Adult probation and parole services for Philadelphia are under the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas court. The Intake and Interstate Units are located in the Basement of the Criminal Justice Center, while all other units are located at 714 Market Street. Criminal dockets would be CP-51-CR-*-2007. CP denotes the court, in this case, Common Pleas. 51 is the county code, in this case Philadelphia County. CR denotes the type of case, criminal. The * represents the case number and the last four digits are the year the case was created. Municipal Court All criminal cases in Philadelphia initially go through Philadelphia Municipal Court, with 27 judges. The Municipal Court maintains jurisdiction over criminal cases where the maximum punishment possible for an offender is less than five years imprisonment. The Municipal Court's traffic division handles all traffic court matters arising within City limits. The Municipal Court also has jurisdiction over civil cases with an amount in controversy less than $12,000 (or $12,500 for fines and most debts owed to the City of Philadelphia, or $15,000 for delinquent real-estate taxes owed to the City and certain tax debts owed to the School District of Philadelphia). The civil division of the Municipal Court also has jurisdiction over all landlord- tenant disputes, residential or commercial, irrespective of the amount in controversy. Appeals from the Municipal Court remain within the First Judicial District by becoming a matter of the Court of Common Pleas. Philadelphia is one of two counties in Pennsylvania that has a Municipal Court (the other being Pittsburgh). Criminal dockets would be MC-51-CR-*-2007. Summary offenses are heard in Community Court, the usual punishment from a summary offense is a small fine and/or community service. The summary dockets would be MC-51-SU-*-2007.

In addition to MPEG/2 broadcasting, the Champion Teleport is also capable of two-way satellite broadband and is connected by multiple fiber optic lines to several terrestrial backbone providers of Internet connectivity. We have the ability to transmit up to 500 TV stations and thousands of audio and radio channels over satellite on Ku, C, and Ka bands (when available) and VSAT connections directly to North and South America, Europe, The Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Located in Oxford, Connecticut, the Champion Teleport is one of only about a dozen such facilities in the world. The FCC licensed the teleport in 1996 and the teleport cannot be replicated without spending tens of millions of dollars and considerable time to obtain zoning permits and construction, creating an immediate barrier to entry. The teleport was upgraded in the last two years to become a unique platform for broadband applications combining a satellite earth station, fiber hubs, television, video and audio post and pre-production studios with control centers and conditional access. Champion Teleport was originally AlphaStar Digital Television, which was one of the original four Direct-To-Home (DTH) satellite television broadcast companies that included DirecTV, EchoStar, PrimeStar, and AlphaStar. Champion now specializes in Internet and intranet broadband content origination, aggregation, multimedia data storage, streaming and digital media services that can then be distributed by a combination of fiber and live 24/7 satellite broadcasts or on demand. Originally built as a part of President Reagan's \`\`Star Wars program, the Champion Teleport was designed according to military specifications including‚Äîcomplete redundancy, climate controls, secret rooms, and the ability to withstand a direct attack. It was intended to protect the US by tracking the former Soviet Union's satellites and missiles.

Biography Rav Pam began his career at Yeshiva Torah Vodaas in 1938, when was appointed maggid shiur (Talmudic lecturer) there. At that time secularism was on the rise in the United States, even amongst Orthodox Jews. In 1943, he married Sarah Balmuth.Kamenetsky, Rabbi Mordechai. The majesty of man, Jewish World Review, August 16, 2002. His teachers included Moshe Rosen (Nezer HaKodesh) and Dovid Leibowitz. During Rav Pam's sixty-plus years at Torah Vodaas, he held many positions. He even taught mathematics in the Yeshiva, utilizing his degree from the City College. For many years in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s he delivered the semicha class to students studying toward rabbinic ordination. Rav Pam's dress was unassuming: he preferred modern short jackets and Fedora hats to the more traditional long frock coats and Homburg hats, generally worn by heads of Yeshivas. While Rav Pam was respected as a great talmudic scholar within Yeshiva circles, he was also widely admired for his humility and soft- spoken style. Rav Pam was a vocal supporter of yeshiva education for non- religious Russian immigrants to Israel through the work of his organization called Shuvu. At the keynote session of the annual 1990 Agudath Israel convention, Rav Pam spoke impassionedly about the influx of new Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union and his concern that their children were growing up oblivious to their religious heritage. He argued that a network of schools should be set up in Israel for those emigrants and organized a convention meeting with wealthy and influential patrons to facilitate his vision. He appointed Avraham Biderman as the chair of Shuvu, the organization founded at that meeting. After Pam's death, the organization was renamed Shuvu: Chazon Avraham, in his memory.

It was recognized by the FIBA in 1936 until 2007 when the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas or SBP was recognized as the new governing body of basketball in the country. It had sanctioned mostly amateur and minor commercial leagues such as the NCRAA, UCAA, Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association and the National Basketball Conference with the BARECOM as its referees.  Leadership crisis  The Basketball Association of the Philippines leadership crisis worsened after a lengthy feud between the group of Graham Lim and Tiny Literal and the group of Freddie Jalasco and Lito Puyat in 2001, which resulted in FIBA's suspension of the basketball NSA. The squabble had been going on since 1995. However, a few months after, FIBA stepped-in and ordered an election that resulted in Literal's victory as the President of the BAP. The suspension was quickly lifted and the Philippines was able to compete in the Southeast Asian Games in Malaysia.The politicization of Philippine basketball. Retrieved on November 6, 2006. Philippine basketball crisis In 2005, the BAP-formed Cebuana-Lhuillier Philippine national team, made up of little-known amateur players, lost to the Para√±aque Jets, owned by city vice mayor and comedian Anjo Yllana in the 2005 National Basketball Conference pre-season tournament. The Jets were bannered by actors and showbiz personalities, while the BAP team was supposed to have been sent to represent the country in an international tournament. This led to calls from Philippine Olympic Committee President Jose \\"Peping\\" Cojuangco to reform the BAP's programs and send a national team made up of professional players from the Philippine Basketball Association. However, disagreements became bitter in mid-2005 as both groups wanted to have their own groups represent the country to the SEABA Men's Basketball tournament in Malaysia. The BAP also replaced Quintellano \\"Tiny\\" Literal with former Philippine senator and Laguna governor Joey Lina as President of the basketball body. As the dispute continued, other National Sports Associations of the POC expelled the association as the National Sports Association for basketball in the country and created the Philippine Basketball Federation, Inc. as the new basketball governing body. The FIBA, meanwhile, continued to recognize only the BAP and instructed its leaders to sort out the issue. In July 2005, FIBA suspended the country from all-FIBA sanctioned events, denying an opportunity to defend the SEABA crown, a qualifying round for the FIBA Asian Championships. Talks of unity would resurface as major basketball stakeholders the PBA, PBL, UAAP and NCAA and Joey Lina, then-BAP President to represent the BAP to form another new association, which materialized in March 2006, and was eventually known as Pilipinas Basketball. However, the talks stalled when Lina backed out from the formation of the group. It was reported that several members of the BAP were not willing to cooperate with the limited power sharing with Pilipinas Basketball. Pilipinas Basketball tried its luck to gain FIBA recognition from FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann but was denied, urging them to \\"keep the course\\". After another dispute between POC and Lina in forming Pilipinas Basketball in March 2006, both groups agreed to a joint communique to form a new cage body, later named as the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, in order to resolve the conflict. However, resurfaced disagreements led to Lina quitting as BAP head after 1¬Ω years at the helm, claiming POC's intervention in the formation of the SBP. Secretary-General Graham Lim also resigned in the SBP Board. After Lina's resignation, Philippine senator Jinggoy Estrada, son of former Philippine president Joseph Estrada, became the new president of the BAP. One of the first moves he tried to make was to request for the padlocked BAP office at the Philippine Sports Commission building to be reopened and to convince the POC to reinstate the BAP. However, those requests were denied, but Estrada was given explanation by POC President Jose Cojuangco about the reasons for the BAP expulsion. Estrada would later work with the SBP on an agreement to unify the two organizations. The BAP board became irate and fired Estrada as its president. Once again, several members of the BAP were not willing to cooperate with the limited power sharing with the SBP. Estrada stayed with the SBP as a special consultant. Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association president Go Teng Kok was named as the association's interim president. FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann, however, fast-tracked the form the SBP, saying that the BAP cannot back out of the \\"Joint Communique\\" which stated that the BAP had to cooperate, and be merged with Pilipinas Basketball to form the SBP. The association was intended to be dissolved and merged with Pilipinas Basketball to form a new basketball body. On February 5, 2007, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas which is intended to be a merger of the two. BAP remains an extant organization and is a member of the Federation of School Sports Association of the Philippines. Criticisms In its final two decades, observers criticized the said association for sending weak basketball teams in international competitions. It became evident when the country placed 15th out of 16 teams in the 2003 FIBA Asia Championships, their lowest ever finish in the tournament. Outrage against officials such as Secretary-General Graham Lim also became prevalent, as it is believed that he had much to do with the sending of the weak teams, while using politics to keep himself in power of the BAP. Leadership squabbles were not an uncommon occurrence, the most notable of which was one the split the association in two, stemming from the BAP elections on August 14, 1995.Fireworks erupt anew in BAP war. April 8, 2001 It was also criticized back in the 1970s by team owners of the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association for its rough treatment of some member teams. This led to 10 companies bolting out of the league in favor of forming the Philippine Basketball Association in 1975.

Born in Washington, D.C., while his father, Henry Clay, was serving in the United States Congress, James Brown Clay was named for the husband of his maternal aunt, James Brown. His brothers were Henry Clay, Jr. and John Morrison Clay. Clay attended a boys' school associated with Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio (founded by family friend Bishop Philander Chase). Later, Clay attended Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky. He worked at a countinghouse in Boston from 1832 to 1834 before studying law and being admitted to the bar. He practiced law with his father in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1843, Clay married Susan Maria Jacob, the daughter of Louisville's first millionaire and sister of its later mayor, Charles Donald Jacob. The couple eventually had ten children. Clay served as Charg√© d'Affaires to Portugal from August 1, 1849, to July 19, 1850. He farmed in Missouri in 1851 and 1852 before returning to Lexington. Clay had been a lifelong member of the Whig Party ‚Äî the party of his father. But when the Whig Party disintegrated following Henry Clay's death, and due to the controversy surrounding the Kansas-Nebraska Act, James B. Clay joined the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-fifth Congress (March 4, 1857 - March 3, 1859). Clay did not run for renomination in 1858 and declined an appointment by President James Buchanan to a mission to Germany. Clay served as a member of the Peace Conference of 1861 held in Washington, D.C., an attempt to prevent the impending American Civil War.

Wenger, Paul White and W. K. Davidson. In the mid-west, Sandy's was the ancestor of the Hardee's chain. History =Beginnings= In 1956, the four men set out to start one of the first McDonald's franchises outside the McDonald brothers' home state of California. Ray Kroc had just begun selling McDonald's franchises outside California, and the four friends partnered to buy the right to open McDonald's restaurants in central Illinois. In June 1956, they opened their first restaurant in Urbana, Illinois, only the third McDonald's restaurant to open outside California. The Urbana store proved popular with students, professionals, and young families at the University of Illinois. It did so well that the group decided to open additional stores in Decatur, and Peoria, Illinois. However, Ray Kroc notified them that Peoria and Decatur were not included in the central Illinois territory, and furthermore that changes to the terms of the franchise meant they would owe a higher percentage of their profits to McDonald's. Having invested heavily in the Peoria location, including erecting the building, Lundberg and his partners decided instead to open their own restaurant, and settled on the name Sandy's. The chain adopted a Scottish-based theme to combat the Scottish-rooted McDonald's, even though the latter was not based on a cultural theme of any kind. Lundberg was named president. =Early success= The menu of the first Sandy's restaurant included a 15¬¢ hamburger, a 20¬¢ milkshake, and a 10¬¢ bag of french fries, much like McDonald's. However, none of the four founders were interested in expanding their local chain. Lundberg, in particular, viewed the enterprise as a chance to build a \\"people-oriented organization whose members worked hard but also had some fun while earning a legitimate profit.\\" Note: a new version of the reprint appears at http://anbhf.org/laureates/gust-e-brick-lundberg-2/ . Sandy's was different in a number of ways from other fast food chains of the time: * Operators of most restaurants owned their stores and did not lease from the corporation. * Operators were not required to buy supplies from the corporation, instead being permitted to \\"shop around\\" as long as the supplies met company standards. * Lundberg visited every store periodically and became personally acquainted with every employee. Ray Kroc did not act indifferently. He filed an ongoing series of lawsuits which finally ended with an out-of- court settlement in 1965. Despite this distraction, Sandy's grew from seven stores in Illinois in 1959 to 121 in five states in 1966. In 1961, insurance man Jack Laughery was so impressed with Lundberg and his business approach that he left a successful practice to join Sandy's, becoming president in 1967. Bill Schelly in his memoir Sense of Wonder reminisced about visits in the mid-1960s when in downtown Pittsburgh he made to \\"a handy hamburger joint named Sandy's (a McDonald's imitator) for greasy cheeseburgers, mounds of salty fries, and massive sodas\\". In 2009 Schelly posted further comments on a Sandy's fan website: =Takeover by Hardee's= By the end of the 1960s, Sandy's, though still successful, was short of cash, a major handicap with the pricey new television advertising being actively employed by its competitors. Meanwhile, the successful Hardee's chain in the Southern U.S. (founded by Wilbur Hardee) had money and was looking to expand its operations. The solution was a merger. On November 30, 1971, a Hardee's purchase of all of Sandy's stock was announced, and Sandy's plaid berets were soon to be seen no more. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Sandy's had expanded to Belgium and Canada before its dismantling. Originally, Sandy's was only to merge with Hardees and maintain its own identity, but in 1973, ninety percent of the locations agreed to switch to Hardee's; the other ten percent remained Sandy's. In 1979, the last Sandy's location in Muscatine, Iowa, became a Hardee's. Any remaining locations went under independent ownership and changed their names to avoid infringing on the Sandy's name. These locations included Zandy's in Great Falls, Montana until it closed in January 2009 after a break in and declining profits, Sandee's in Billings, Montana, Andy's in Cincinnati, Ohio and Bucky's in Lawrence, Kansas until it closed down on December 14, 2007.

Off-Road Motorsports Hall of Fame is located inside Terrible's Hotel & Casino in Jean, Nevada. History In 1966, Ed Pearlman cofounded the first exclusively off-road racing organization, called the National Off-Road Racing Association (NORRA). The first event by NORRA (1967) was called the Mexican 1000 Rally, which was later renamed the Baja 1000. Pearlman stopped promoting the series in 1976, so he decided to recognize contributors to the sport. He inducted the first sixteen members in the hall of fame in January 1978. He inducted a second group in 1980. He was unable to come up with a site to host the hall of fame. Pearlman sold the series in 1995 to Rod Hall. While looking through Pearlman's boxes, Hall noticed Pearlman's notes about the hall of fame. Hall talked with Gordon Horsley of the National Automobile Museum, and the Hall of Fame became a resident in the National Automobile Museum.

Classes were held on one floor of the University library building until the College of Law moved to a separate facility in 1953. Because of increasing class size, the College of Law relocated to its current building in 1977. Considerable library space and a variety of other rooms were added to the building in 1993. The building contains three classrooms, a large moot courtroom, a small moot court room, two seminar rooms, a student lounge area, lockers for every student, the law library (which include yearly study carrel), and faculty and staff offices.AHC Finding Aid for the University of Wyoming. College of Law Records Moot Court Rooms Entrance to Large Moot Court RoomInside Large Moot Court RoomIn 2009, the University of Wyoming College of Law finished construction on a large addition to the college of law that expanded the main lecture hall and added two technologically advanced moot court rooms. The main moot court room is the main lecture hall, but includes a retrieving class room wall that opens up into the large moot court room. This court room has become so useful that since it was finished, the Wyoming Supreme Court and the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals have both used it to hear oral arguments.

The form of the styling of this case‚Äîthe defendant being an object, rather than a legal person‚Äîis because this is a jurisdiction in rem (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar in personam (over persons) case. In current US legal practice, in rem is most widely used in the area of asset forfeiture, frequently in relation to controlled substances offenses. In rem forfeiture cases allow property (in this case, $124,700 in cash) to be directly sued by and forfeited to the government, without either just compensation or the possessor (and presumptive owner) being convicted of a crime. Background The defendant currency was seized on May 28, 2003, from one of the claimants, Emiliano Gomez Gonzalez. According to testimony adduced at trial, Gonzalez was driving west on Interstate 80 in a rented Ford Taurus when a Nebraska State Patrol Trooper, Chris Bigsby, stopped Gonzalez for exceeding the posted speed limit. Trooper Bigsby testified that he asked Gonzalez to sit in the front passenger side of his patrol vehicle during the stop. At Bigsby's request, Gonzalez presented a Nevada driver's license and a rental contract for the car, but the rental contract was not in Gonzalez's name and did not list Gonzalez as an additional driver. Trooper Bigsby did not speak fluent Spanish, but he testified that Gonzalez responded to his questions, which were mostly in English, in a combination of English and Spanish. Bigsby asked Gonzalez where he was going, and Gonzalez responded that he had been in Chicago for three days. Gonzalez indicated that a person named \\"Luis\\" had rented the car for him, but the name \\"Luis\\" did not match the name on the rental agreement that he presented to Trooper Bigsby. Trooper Bigsby also twice inquired whether Gonzalez had ever been arrested or placed on probation or parole, and Gonzalez said that he had not. Before Trooper Bigsby had completed the traffic stop, another officer, Jason Brownell, stopped to ask if Bigsby needed any assistance. When Trooper Bigsby found out that Trooper Brownell had some Spanish-speaking ability, Bigsby asked if Brownell would stay and assist. Trooper Bigsby testified that with Brownell's assistance, he completed a warning citation and returned Gonzalez's license and paperwork. Having learned through his dispatcher that Gonzalez had been arrested in 2003 for driving while intoxicated, Bigsby then asked, through Trooper Brownell, if he could \\"ask a few more questions,\\" and Gonzalez answered yes. Again through Trooper Brownell, Bigsby asked if Gonzalez had ever been arrested for driving while intoxicated, and Gonzalez answered that he had. Bigsby and Brownell also inquired whether any alcohol, guns, marijuana, methamphetamine, heroin, or large amounts of cash were in the car, and Gonzalez answered no. Brownell then asked for and received consent to search the car. Trooper Bigsby went directly to the rear passenger side of the vehicle and opened a cooler that was in the back seat, where he found a large plastic bag that contained seven bundles wrapped in rubber bands inside aluminum foil packaging. These bundles contained a total of $124,700 in currency. Gonzalez and the vehicle were then taken to the Nebraska State Patrol office in Lincoln. Lawsuit The district court concluded that the government had not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was a substantial connection between the money and a drug trafficking offense. The court noted that large sums of unexplained currency can be evidence of drug trafficking, and that in this case the money was bundled in an unusual manner. The court also concluded, however, that the claimants had given a \\"plausible and consistent explanation for [the money's] origin and intended use,\\" (Add. at 12), and that \\"the bundling is consistent with an attempt to sort the currency by contributor and conceal the currency from would-be thieves,\\" and not just to evade law enforcement. (Id. at 13). In addition, the court observed that the government had not presented any expert testimony about \\"whether the manner the bundles were wrapped either increased or decreased the likelihood of the currency's use or connection with a drug trafficking offense.\\" (Id.) Opinion of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Steven Colloton wrote the majority opinion for himself and Judge Arnold. Colloton wrote, \\"The United States initiated civil forfeiture proceedings against $124,700 in United States currency, alleging that the money was subject to forfeiture as the proceeds of a drug transaction or as property used to facilitate the possession, transportation, sale, concealment, receipt, or distribution of a controlled substance. See 21 U.S.C.¬ß 881(a)(6). Three individuals filed claims opposing the forfeiture, and after a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of the claimants. The government appeals, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\\" Dissenting opinion Senior Circuit Judge Donald P. Lay, a Lyndon B. Johnson appointee to the Eighth Circuit, dissented, concluding \\"I cannot agree that the government has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, the requisite substantial connection between the currency and a controlled substance offense.\\" See also *United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit *List of United States courts of appeals cases *Asset forfeiture *War on Drugs *United States v.

As with other forms of capital, sexual capital is convertible, and may be useful in acquiring other forms of capital, including social capital and economic capital.  Origins  The term erotic capital was first used by British sociologist Catherine Hakim in the early 2000s. Hakim defined it as separate from and building upon French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of economic, cultural and social capital. She says erotic capital is independent of class origin and therefore enables social mobility, and argues that this makes erotic capital socially subversive, which results in the prevailing power structures devaluing and trying to suppress it. In the manosphere, the parallel term sexual market value or its abbreviation SMV is often used.Boysen, Benjamin. \\"Houellebecq's Priapism: The Failure of Sexual Liberation in Michel Houellebecq's Novels and Essays.\\" Canadian Review of Comparative Literature 43.3 (2016): 477‚Äì497. Definition =Economic= One economic-related definition is based on the human truth capital theory of Gary Becker, and predicts that people invest rationally in exhibiting their sex appeal when they can expect a return on their investments. He defines this as a form of health capital, which is itself a form of individual capital. Another definition, comes from Capital Portfolio Theory, in which Green argues that sexual capital is part of an individual's overall capital portfolio. An individual can transfer their sexual capital to other forms of capital within Capital Portfolio Theory. From an economic perspective, having high sexual capital is advantageous, since it can help an individual in multiple aspects of their lives. For example, multiple studies have shown that increased physical attractiveness is correlated with higher incomes after eliminating other factors. =Sociology= The sociological definition is based on Bourdieu's idea of fields. This definition builds on Bourdieu's concept of capital. Green defines sexual capital as accruing to an individual or group due to the quality and quantity of attributes that he or she possesses which elicit an erotic response in another, including physical appearance, affect and sociocultural styles. Some of these attributes may be immutable, such as an individual's race or height, while others may be acquired through fitness training, or artificially, through plastic surgery or a makeover, etc. There is no single hegemonic form of erotic (sexual) capital. On the contrary, currencies of capital are quite variable, acquiring a hegemonic status in relation to the erotic preferences of highly specialized social groups that distinguish one sexual field from another. Importantly, this means that erotic capital is best conceived as a property of the field, and not an individual form of capital. A second definition is developed by Hakim, treating erotic capital as the fourth personal asset. This definition is a multifaceted combination of physical and social attractiveness that goes well beyond sexual attractiveness that is the focus of the 'fields' perspective. Unlike Green's conception of sexual capital, Hakim's erotic capital is an individual capital with no necessary referent to a field. Extensive supporting evidence for the concept of sexual capital, defined as beauty, physical attractiveness, and good looks, is provided in Daniel Hamermesh's latest book, Beauty Pays, where he reviews the research evidence on the economic benefits of being attractive in all contexts, including higher education teaching, politics, sales and marketing, and everyday social interaction. Hamermesh assumes these economic benefits must be due to unfair discrimination, a position he takes from Deborah Rhode's book, Beauty Bias, a feminist lawyer's critique of the social benefits that accrue to attractive people, and the disadvantages experienced by unattractive people, most particularly the obese. Importance Catherine Hakim argues that erotic capital matters beyond the sexual field, and beyond private relationships. Her research suggests that erotic capital is important in the fields of media, politics, advertising, sports, the arts, and in everyday social interaction, and consists of six elements: # Beauty # Sexual attractiveness # Social attractiveness # Vivaciousness and energy # Presentation # Sexuality Catherine Hakim's theory of erotic capital argues that erotic capital is an important fourth personal asset, alongside economic capital, cultural/human capital and social capital; that erotic capital is increasingly important in affluent modern societies; that women generally have more erotic capital than men, and that erotic capital has social benefits and privileges that benefit the female gender. This definition of erotic capital has been contested by some sociologists who reject the idea that erotic capital / sexual capital is something individuals possess, like a portable portfolio of resources, with no implicit link to the particular sexual field in which such characteristics are deemed desirable.For more, see Sexual capital may be related to both sexual and mental health, as when individuals with low sexual capital show diminished ability to talk about or negotiate condom use with a partner possessing greater erotic capital, and develop negative emotional states as a consequence of feeling unattractive. In broader theoretical terms, sexual capital is important for social theory insofar as it is one among other types of capital, including social capital, symbolic capital, and cultural capital which influence the status accorded individual members of the larger society. Sexual capital is convertible to other forms of capital, as when actors parlay sexual capital into financial capital or social capital (e.g. Marilyn Monroe), or when attractive employees get raises and social connections from bringing in more customers by virtue of their looks.  Cultural and contextual factors  =Race= Several studies suggest that sexual capital is closely associated with race or racial stereotypes of sexual attractiveness. Some studies show a more complex relationship between erotic capital and race. For example, some black men are afforded high sexual status because they appeal to the fantasies of some heterosexual white women. Susan Koshy argues that Asian women have gained sexual capital in the West through glamorous accounts of western male ‚Äì Asian female sexual relationships in the media and arts. James Farrer argues that white men living in China have enhanced sexual capital arising out of associations of whiteness with modernity, sexual openness and mobility. = Culture = Idealized traits can vary greatly between cultures, although there are a few beauty standards that are almost universal. Facial symmetry, for example, is a physically-desirable characteristic that is near universal. However, many physical characteristics, like height and weight, have different ideals based on an individual's culture. Not having a culture's desired physical traits can lead to a loss of sexual capital, which would likely decrease an individual's overall capital portfolio. This phenomenon is especially apparent when individuals relocate to an area with different beauty ideals, as there may be a large change in an individual's sexual capital. = Religion = Sexual capital can be present in both secular and religious settings. Willey has shown that in an Evangelical youth group, sexual and erotic capital still play a role in partner selection. Young adults often find a romantic interest in their church groups, often by choosing a partner who has sought-after traits, or a desirable personal capital portfolio. Within the Evangelical youth groups studied, sexual capital was displayed as virginal capital, in which an individual was considered more romantically desirable by the group when they had not engaged in sexual activity. Additionally, some studies point out how adolescents may reduce their religious involvement around their sexual debut. Pentecostal adolescents in Cape Town were shown to reduce their church attendance in early adulthood, with some resuming their previous attendance after finding a long-term partner. These studies show some of the effects of religion on influencing sexual behavior norms of a community. While limited studies have been conducted on the effects of sexual and erotic capital within other religious communities, much has been written on how religion has shaped human sexuality. =Class and gender= Scholars suggest that sexual capital is closely tied to social class. Groes-Green argues that sexual capital and other forms of bodily power become important resources among disenfranchised young men in Mozambique when their access to economic capital and jobs is diminished. Groes-Green further argues that the emergence of sexual capital is linked to gender relations, e.g. when poor young men build sexual capital by grooming their looks and improving sexual performance in order to satisfy female partners This puts the young poor men in competition with middle class peers and older so-called \\"sugar-daddies\\". Thus sexual capital reinforces masculinity in the face of male disempowerment, and it often develops as a response to conflict between hegemonic and subordinated masculinity. = Sexuality = Riggs has cited several studies of gay men's behavior on Grindr, which showed that white users had received more attention on the app than users who did not identify as white in their biographies. Other studies have shown that men who report a taller than average height, a more muscular body, have more traditionally masculine characteristics, and self-identify as white receive more attention from other members than those who lack these characteristics. Receiving more attention on Grindr, measured by taps or messages from other users, has been used by researchers to find the number of individuals who viewed a profile as sexually desirable. This measure could signify higher levels of sexual capital. Within the lesbian community, gender non-conformity has been thought to increase an individual's sexual capital. However, the reasons behind this are often the product of society's views on gender non-conformity and lesbianism. Many butch lesbians may have higher sexual capital within lesbian communities, since they actively subvert gender stereotypes, a trait often celebrated within the community. Conversely, femme lesbians may lack sexual capital in queer spaces. However, feminine presenting queer women may receive sexual capital outside of lesbian communities, particularly among heterosexual men. Capital portfolios Because desirability in a sexual field may depend on more than merely sexual attractiveness, Green (2014) develops the concept, capital portfolio, to capture the particular combination of capitals that make an individual or group more desirable than others. Capital portfolios typically involve a combination of sexual capital with economic, cultural and social capitals. As an example, to the extent that women, on average, value financial resources (i.e., economic capital) in their male partners more than sexual capital, and men value sexual capital more than economic capital in their female partners, so one may conclude that heterosexual women and men seek out distinctive capital portfolios that include a different, gendered balance of capitals.  Criticism  As sexual capital and related theories by Catherine Hakim have gained public exposure, there has been criticism from several researchers. The arguments have focused largely on how Hakim's theory disproportionately impact women, even though she considers it a universal theory. Female sexuality varies to a greater extent across culture and socioeconomic status than male sexuality. Women from racial, socioeconomic, sexual, or gender minority groups may face additional pressures in what is considered attractive depending on their environment. Additionally, Hakim's theory of sexual capital, including the idea that an individual can change their level of capital, is limited through these considerations. While Hakim argues that sexual capital can be exchanged and modified by an individual, this is only possible for the average person in certain sociopolitical contexts. An individual is bounded by their society's views on sex, sexuality and social norms. In some cases, like in a neoliberal secular society, individuals have a wider freedom of choice in how they present their sexuality and eroticism. Bay-Cheng argues that in neoliberal societies, an individual's motivation for their behavior, along with the behavior itself, is used to evaluate their sexual capital.

The stinger of a stingray Venomous fish are species of fish which produce strong mixtures of toxins harmful to humans (called venom) which they deliberately deliver by means of a bite, sting, or stab, resulting in an envenomation. As a contrast, poisonous fish also produce a strong toxin, but they do not bite, sting, or stab to deliver the toxin, instead being poisonous to eat because the human digestive system does not destroy the toxin they contain in their body. Venomous fish do not necessarily cause poisoning if they are eaten, as the digestive system often destroys the venom.Poisonous vs. Venomous fish: What‚Äôs the difference? Reef Biosearch. Retrieved 17 July 2009. There are at least 1200 species of venomous fish, Smith WL and Wheeler WC (2006) \\"Venom Evolution Widespread in Fishes: A Phylogenetic Road Map for the Bioprospecting of Piscine Venoms\\" Journal of Heredity 97 (3):206-217. with catfishes alone possibly contributing 1250-1625 species to that total. The former number accounts for two-thirds of the venomous vertebrate population. There are more venomous fish than venomous snakes and indeed more than the combined total of all other venomous vertebrates. Venomous fish are found in almost all habitats around the world, but mostly in tropical waters. Encounters with these species injure over 50,000 people every year.Venomous Fish Outnumber Snakes, LiveScience, 22 August 2006. Venomous fishes carry their venom in venom glands and use various delivery systems, such as spines or sharp fins, barbs, spikes and fangs. The most common venom delivery system is via dorsal spines. Venomous fish tend to be either very visible, using flamboyant colors to discourage predators from attacking them, or skillfully camouflaged and possibly buried in the sand. Apart from the value of improved self defense or capacity to kill prey, venom helps bottom dwelling fish by killing bacteria that could otherwise invade their skin. Few of these venoms have been studied. They are a yet-to-be tapped resource for bioprospecting to find drugs with medical uses.Grady, Denise Venom Runs Thick in Fish Families, Researchers Learn New York Times 22 August 2006. Examples * The most venomous known fish is the reef stonefish.\\"The Stonefish ‚Äì The Deadliest Fish in The World\\", Virginia Wells, Petplace.com. It has a remarkable ability to camouflage itself amongst rocks. It is an ambush predator that sits on the bottom waiting for prey to approach. Instead of swimming away if disturbed, it erects 13 venomous spines along its back. For defense it can shoot venom from each or all of these spines. Each spine is like a hypodermic needle, delivering the venom from two sacs attached to the spine. The stonefish has control over whether to shoot its venom, and does so when provoked or frightened. The venom results in severe pain, paralysis and tissue death, and can be fatal if not treated. Despite its formidable defenses, stonefish have predators. Some bottom feeding rays and sharks with crushing teeth feed on them, as does the Stokes' seasnake. Reef Stonefish, Synanceia verrucosa (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) Australian Museum. Retrieved 21 July 2009. * The lionfish is a venomous coral reef fish. Unlike stonefish, a lionfish can release venom only if something strikes its spines. Although not native to the U.S. coast, lionfish have appeared around Florida and have spread up the coast to New York, possibly due to a hurricane washing captive specimens into natural waters. Lionfish can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture their facemask with their venomous spines. * The stargazer buries itself and can deliver electric shocks as well as venom. It is a delicacy in some cultures (cooking destroys the venom), and can be found for sale in some fish markets with the electric organ removed. They have been called \\"the meanest things in creation\\" * Stingrays can sting and cause an injury with their stinger, with such envenomations frequently occurring when people wade in shallow water and tread on them. Such encounters can be avoided by shuffling through the sand or stamping on the bottom, as the rays detect this and swim away. The stinger usually breaks off in the wound, and as it is barbed it can easily penetrate the skin but is difficult to remove once lodged into the victim. The stinger causes local trauma from the cut itself, pain and swelling from the venom, and possible later infection from bacteria. Occasionally severed arteries or death can result. *Another very well-known venomous fish is the fang-tooth blenny. They have venom that contains the opioid-like enkephalin, phospholipase, and neuropeptide Y.Losey GS. 1972. Predation protection in the poison-fang blenny, Meiacanthus atrodorsalis, and its mimics, Ecsenius bicolor and Runula laudandus (Blenniidae). Pac Sci 26(2): 129-139. Enkephalin and phospholipase both produce inflammatory responses and neuropeptide Y induces a severe drop in blood pressure to the effected area. Blennies inject their venom via hollow, mandibular fangs.  Antivenom  Striped poison fang blenny can deliver a quick and painful blow.Venomous fish are very often involved in human injury, usually by accident, but few studies have been done to investigate the constituents of fish venom. Even fewer studies have been done to create antivenom. The only commercially available antivenom is for the Indo-Pacific stonefish, Synanceja trachynis Stonefish Antivenom (SFAV).  Biological and pharmacological importance of fish venoms  It has been found that the mucous and sting venom of Potamotrygon cf. henlei, a species of stingray that is found in Brazil, is toxic to mice that have nociceptive, edematogenic, and proteolysis activities. Two peptides were isolated from the stingray venom, orpotrin, which causes vasoconstriction, and porflan, which causes inflammation. Knowing how these peptides are structured could lead to the development of a neutralization technique that could effectively act as an antivenom. Of all the piscine venoms studied, they all produce profound cardiovascular alterations, both in vivo and in vitro. These changes stimulate the release of nitric oxide from the endothelial cells, smooth muscle contractions, and other effects of the atria. Piscine venoms also produce neuromuscular activity effects- depolarization of nerve and muscle cells. In addition, piscine venoms have strong cytolytic activity. In experimental models and in Western immunoblotting analysis, all tested piscine venoms showed structural similarity, which could lead to the advent of an overarching antivenom or other novel uses.

Later in his career Carlsen expanded his range of subjects to include landscapes and marines as well.Dayton Art Institute Catalog, p. 82 During his long career he won many of the most important honors in American art and was elected to membership in the National Academy of Design. For more than forty years he was also a respected teacher in Chicago, San Francisco and New York. Early career Study in Grey, 1906, Dallas Museum of Art Emil Carlsen was born and raised in the Danish capital of Copenhagen. He came from an artistic family. His mother painted,Newlin Price, \\"Emil Carlsen: Painter, Teacher\\", International Studio, July 1922, p. 301 and by some accounts, his cousin, who was an influence on him, later became the director of the Danish Royal AcademyGerdts, Painters of the Humble Truth, p. 228 and Price disagree on whether this was his brother or cousin, but Price's account came from Carlsen himself. He studied architecture at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen for four years and then emigrated to the United States in 1872, settling in Chicago, United States. Interested in art, he first worked as an architect's assistant and studied with the Danish marine artist Lauritz Holst. However, Holst returned to Denmark, leaving his studio to Carlsen.Connecticut Impressionism Catalog He made rapid progress and was appointed the first teacher of drawing and painting at the Chicago Academy of Design,It is often incorrectly stated that Carlsen taught at the Art Institute, but the Chicago Academy of Design was founded in 1866, modeled after the NAD in New York, only in 1882 did the name change to the familiar A.I.C. See wikipedia entry on the Art Institute. Carlsen sought more training and embarked for Paris in 1875, where he came under the influence of the French still life painter Jean- Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin.Morseburg's Carlsen Introduction When he returned to the United States, he set up a studio in New York and began to painted tonalist still lifes that were somewhat reminiscent of those of Chardin. However, selling work was still a struggle. After moving to Boston he had a short period of good sales. He returned to New York and again struggled to sell his paintings. In 1879 he held an auction to help ease his financial situation but ended up selling only a few paintings. This compelled him to give up his studio and take up engraving with which he found some success despite his frustration at not being able to paint full-time.F. Newlyn Price, Emil Carlsen: Painter Teacher, International Studio, July, 1922, 300-301 These often depicted copper pans, game, or flowers. The acceptance of a still life in the exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1883 was the first noteworthy event in his career. In 1884 he returned to Europe, painting commissions of floral still lifes for the dealer, Theron J. Blakeslee, to support his studies. Eventually he turned his back on the demand for pretty flowers.Gerdts, p. 228 In 1885 Carlsen had two works accepted for the Paris Salon. Returning to New York he opened a studio on 57th Street. However, finding that it was still difficult to sell paintings he moved to San FranciscoPrice, Emil Carlsen, p. 301 where between 1887 and 1889 he held a position as director of the California School of Design. He became friends with Arthur Mathews, who taught at the School of Design and was the leading figure in the Bay Area Arts and Crafts Movement.Richard Boyle, American Impressionism, p. 136-137 He then moved on to teach privately at the San Francisco Art Students League until 1891. During those years he influenced a number of young students, among them were M. Evelyn McCormick and Guy Rose, who both became leading Giverny Impressionists.Jeffrey Morseburg, Emil Carlsen.com In 1891, just prior to his departure, Carlsen created a firestorm by openly declaring in one of San Francisco‚Äôs leading newspapers that art education was wasted on women who were inferior pupils without self-confidence and who were expected to become school teachers and marry.San Francisco Examiner, 19 July 1891, p. 14. Arthur Mathews published a spirited rebuttal that provoked further debate. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website. Return to the east Carlsen moved back to the east from California in 1891 and began a long career of teaching in the East. He taught at the National Academy of Design, at the student-founded Art Student's League, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Gradually, through his relationship with other New York-based painters and teachers such as John Twachtman and Julian Alden Weir, he became interested in painting landscapes and marines.Gerdts, American Impressionism, p. 229 Carlsen sketched in Connecticut in the early 1900s, visiting his friend Julian Alden Weir in Branchville, Fairfield County, Connecticut. This became the famous \\"Weir Farm\\" where many American Impressionists painted landscape en plein-air. The Carlsens and their young son Dines spent several summers living in a cottage on the farm. The artists would paint during the day and socialize in the evening. Carlsen purchased a home in Falls Village, Connecticut in 1905 and the Carlsen family spent most of their time there when Carlsen did not have teaching commitments in New York. Falls Village is in the Berkshire Foothills and Carlsen painted the rolling foothills and the forests of the Berkshire Mountains.Connecticut and American Impressionism, p. 155 Success and respect Although he was considered to be one of the most respected American painters, Carlsen struggled financially for the first several decades of his career. The Macbeth Gallery in New York was the first gallery that specialized in the work of American artists. After Carlsen joined the gallery, which represented many of the American Impressionism artists, his sales improved and for the first time he was able to live comfortably without constant financial stress. He had solo exhibitions at Macbeth in 1912, 1919 and 1921 and 1923.Carol Lowrey, A Legacy of Art: Paintings and Sculpture by Members of the National Arts Club, p.68-69 He received the Samuel T. Shaw Purchase Prize at the National Academy of Design. Teaching career Emil Carlsen was a sought after teacher and financial necessity drove him to teach more than he wanted, taking time away from his painting. As he became more financially successful, he cut back on his teaching commitments. He taught the life class at the National Academy of Design from 1905 to 1909. He commuted from New York to Philadelphia to lecture at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for many years.David Bernard Dearinger, Paintings and Sculpture in the National Academy of Design, p.87 Among his pupils was the miniaturist Rosa Hooper. Personal life Emil Carlsen married Luela Mary Ruby in 1896 and the couple moved into his 59th Street studio, where they made their home for the remainder of their lives. They had a single child, Dines Carlsen in 1901 who was home schooled. His mother taught him scholastic subjects and his father instructed him in art. Dines Carlsen began his own exhibition career in 1914, exhibiting a still life at the National Academy of Design when he was thirteen. Dines Carlsen was made an Associate National Academician in 1922, when he was 21, and a full Academician in 1942. Dines Carlsen exhibited alongside his father at the Grand Central Galleries in New York. He had three solo exhibitions at that gallery. After Dines Carlsen died in 1966, Grand Central Galleries held a dual retrospective exhibition to honor both artists. Carlsen was close friends with Julian Alden Weir, John Twachtman and Childe Hassam. Artistic philosophy In 1908, Carlsen published an article on still life painting for the now obscure art journal Palette and Bench where he wrote of the low status of still lifes: > ... still life painting is considered of small importance in the Art > schools, both here and abroad, the usual course being drawn from the > antique, the nude, and painting the draped figure and from the nude. ... > Then why should the earnest student overlook the simplest and most thorough > way of acquiring all the knowledge of the craft of painting and drawing, the > study of inanimate objects, still life painting, the very surest road to > absolute mastery over all technical difficulties.Emil Carlsen, \\"On Still- > Life Painting,\\" Palette and Bench (October 1908): p. 6-8. Critical responses Professor William Gerdts wrote extensively of Carlsen and his aesthetic sensibility in his book on American still life painting \\"Painters of the Humble Truth\\" and he describes the objects in the paintings as > ...often lacking in traditional beauty, What makes the paintings beautiful > is Carlsen's sensitivity in arrangement - large shapes are juxtaposed with > small flat forms and tall ones, their outlines are often united in refined > harmonious curves. and are placed backward and forward on their limited > support surface to allow for \\"breathing room,\\" for slow movement in > space.Gerdts, William, Painters of the Humble Truth, p. 230 The art historian Richard Boyle also noted Carlsen's craftsmanship, in his book American Impressionism, states: > Carlesen's special concern was still life, and his paintings are beautifully > crafted and delicate of surface, reminiscent of Whistler and especially > Dewing. Carlsen was concerned with \\"ideal beauty\\" as well as the beauty > inherent in the subject, in texture and color; as in Dewing's works, the > placement of the objects on his canvas is extremely important ...Richard > Boyle, American Impressionism, p. 147 The art writer Arthur Edwin Bye featured Carlsen most prominently in his survey of American Still life painting in 1921 and wrote of him: > Emil Carlsen is unquestionably the most accomplished master of still-life > painting in America today. ... It is evident that Carlsen has lifted his art > to a height it has never reached before.\\"Arthur Edwin Bye, Pots and Pans or > Studies in Still Life Painting (1921), p. 213-214. In American Impressionism, William Gerdts wrote about Carlsen's transition from still life artist to landscape painter: > Carlsen was attracted to the beauties of the rolling hills and interpreted > them in soft, pastel tones. Carlsen's landscape mode, however, is more more > completely of this century, and it developed in the more decorative, > somewhat naturalistic manner that characterized later Impressionism.Gerdts, > American Impressionism, p. 229.

Background Brick Lundberg was born in 1920 in Kewanee, Illinois. He attended the University of Illinois and immediately after graduation received a commission in the Air Force. During the war Lundberg was an adjutant with the 387th bomb group and after the war he partnered with the group's flight surgeon to buy Culligan Soft Water franchises in Kewanee and Macomb, Illinois and Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 1948, after the death of his older brother, Brick returned to Kewanee to be near his father. He opened a store, Kewanee Rite, to market some of his father's inventions and became actively involved in the town's civic organizations, so much so that the Kewanee Junior Chamber of Commerce named him Outstanding Young Man of the Year in 1951 and in 1955 (he received the same award for the State of Illinois that year). Lundberg was known for his ability to inspire people to operate as part of a team and achieve more than they thought possible, as demonstrated by his success in revitalizing the local National Guard unit and achieving the building of a new armory for the town. Career In 1956 he partnered with three friends‚ÄîPaul White, Robert C. Wenger and W.K. Davidson‚Äîto buy one of the first McDonald's franchises outside the state of California. Although their restaurant was successful, differences with McDonald's founder Ray Kroc led the group to open their own regional restaurant chain which they called Sandy's. The Sandy's restaurants were a smaller, less-corporate and more-personal chain; Lundberg made it a habit to visit every single Sandy's personally on a regular basis and get to know every employee. His warmth and encouragement made everyone he encountered feel valued and inspired. :In working with the board, I used to have to do cash flow, project sales, percents of increases‚Ä¶and I really didn't think I could do it...(but) Brick came down and talked to me one day, and I thought (afterwards) I could do six times more than what he wanted me to do...He gave me the determination and made me feel that I was a chosen one; I really, really (felt) chosen. (Anne Bower, secretary) :They'd see other people come in big Cadillacs and Lincolns, and not talk to 'em, then there would come Brick Lundberg, Chairman of the Board and President of Sandy's in his little Rambler. He'd pull in the lot, get out, pick up a cup, pick up a wrapper, come in the store, dispose of the paper products he found in the lot that shouldn't have been there (and he'd get a message across without saying a word: your lot's dirty!), and he'd walk in and shake everybody's hand; he was really happy to see 'em all! (unknown employee) The Sandy's chain grew from just 7 stores in 1959 to 121 in 1966, at which point Lundberg opted to step down (remaining Chairman of the Board) and spend more time with his family. He also returned to his community responsibilities, raising $200,000 towards establishment of a community college in Kewanee and persuading Black Hawk College, a two-year school, to open a campus there. In recognition of his efforts, the new college named its library after him (now the Gust E. Lundberg Learning Resources Center). Brick returned to active duty with Sandy's briefly in the early 1970s to revitalize it and then oversee its merger with Hardee's. After the merger Lundberg retired permanently, but Jack Laughery, CEO of Sandy's, accepted a position with the new expanded Hardee's, giving Lundberg the satisfaction of seeing many of his management principles adopted.

Regarded as a good-luck charm, Faust helped the New York Giants win the 1911 National League championship. Major League Baseball career Faust was born in Marion, Kansas, in 1880. In July 1911, he went to St. Louis and visited John McGraw, the manager of the New York Giants. Faust told McGraw that a fortuneteller said he would help the Giants win the championship. As a joke, McGraw gave Faust a tryout, and he was eventually allowed to stay due to the team's sudden winning streak that commenced after his arrival. The Giants had a record of 36‚Äì2 that season when Faust was in uniform; when he was not there, they struggled. Faust wanted to pitch in a real game, but having little athletic ability, he was relegated to warming up with the team on the field. After the Giants clinched the pennant, Faust pitched in the ninth inning of two games, allowing one run and stealing two bases.Schecter, Gabriel. \\"Charlie Faust\\". sabr.org. Retrieved December 3, 2015. The following season, the Giants started 54‚Äì11 with Faust. He still wanted to pitch, however, McGraw grew tired of him. Faust was permanently dismissed from the team. Without him, the Giants saw their hot streak end, but they did win the pennant again. Later life Faust moved to California and then to Seattle. In 1914, still intent on rejoining the Giants, he walked to Portland and was sent to a mental hospital, where he was diagnosed with dementia. Later that year, he was sent to the Western State Hospital. He died there of tuberculosis in 1915. Faust's story was revived in the 1960s, when one of his Giants teammates, Fred Snodgrass, talked about him in an interview for The Glory of Their Times. Faust is also mentioned in E. L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime.

It was performed entirely in a public house. It was a sequel to O.T.T., itself a spin-off from Tiswas. From these previous shows were regulars Bob Carolgees and Helen Atkinson-Wood, as well as newcomer to television Tony Slattery. Guest appearances included Frank Carson and making his TV debut, impressionist Phil Cool. O.T.T. had been a critical disaster for Central, and had angered the Independent Broadcasting Authority (the commercial television watchdog), so instead of automatically granting a second series, they decided to slash the budget and insisted on pre-recording instead of the show going out live. This decision so enraged producer/presenter Chris Tarrant, who had been largely responsible for the success of Central's Tiswas, that after the meeting with management, he slammed a door so hard the glass shattered. Due to the low budget circumstances and keen to keep a laddish air about the format, the decision was made to film from a local pub, and portray it as though they were in an illegal after-hours drinking session. This gave the show the name 'Stayback', which was included in the opening titles and break bumpers, but by the time Central were ready to transmit it, it was decided to be referred to as 'Saturday Stayback', despite this name never being used in the programme. Tarrant's friend from Tiswas and O.T.T. John Gorman was used on this show for writing, keeping himself off-screen. Ex-Tiswas presenter Sally James (another friend of Tarrant) was a guest in one show. Kevin Seisay wrote and performed some of the comedy songs. Musical guests included Roy Wood, who also contributed the theme tune, heavy rockers Gillan and two appearances by Thin Lizzy. The show ended after its initial six episode run.

It began operation in 1908 and through the merger of several companies became the largest interurban railway operator in the South before its demise in 1948. History In 1901 the Denison and Sherman Railway opened as the first interurban rail line in Texas, connecting the towns of Denison and Sherman with ten miles of track. This line was purchased in 1911 by the Texas Traction Company, who had constructed a sixty- five-mile line of their own from Dallas to Sherman and began operation in 1908. Seeing a need to expand in other directions, the owners of the Texas Traction Company purchased a twenty-eight-mile line from Dallas to Waxahachie in 1912. Built by the Dallas Southern Traction Company, the company became known as the Southern Traction Company and the rail line extended to Waco in 1913. A separate fifty-six-mile line from Dallas to Corsicana was also completed. In 1917 the Texas Traction Company and the Southern Traction Company merged to form the Texas Electric Railway Company and became the largest interurban railway in the South with more than 200 miles of track. The interurban became a vital link for communities until the popularity of the automobile caused a decline in revenue. The Dallas-Corsicana branch was discontinued in 1941 and the Dallas-Waco and Dallas-Denison branches closed in 1948.Robert A.

It is the first professional military education that enlisted Air Force members encounter. ALS focuses on developing leadership abilities, the profession of arms, and building effective communication. ALS was established in the 1990s, replacing the Non-commissioned Officer (NCO) Preparatory Course and NCO Leadership School. Eligibility Senior Airmen with 36 months time in service or those with a promotion line number for Staff Sergeant are eligible to attend the School. The member must also have at least six months of retainability from the projected class graduation date before being enrolled. Awards in ALS * Noncommissioned Officer Development Ribbon - Mandatory award and wear upon successful completion of ALS. * John Levitow Award - The highest award presented at Airman Leadership School, the Levitow award is presented to the student that demonstrates the most outstanding leadership and scholastic qualities. Selection for the Levitow award is based on academic performance and assignment of points by peers and instructors (although it is unclear what weight each category carries in determining the winner). * Commandant Leadership Award - Presented to the student who has displayed all the characteristics of an effective leader, but is not solely based on academic standings. Depending on class size, one or two students from each flight in the class are selected by their peers and must meet with the Commandant. The commandant is the final determining factor in who is awarded the honor. * Academic Achievement Award - Presented to the student with highest overall average on all academic evaluations. * Distinguished Graduate Award - Presented to the next (10% of graduates) person with the highest overall average in all graded areas, and demonstrated a high level of leadership skills. Supervision without SSgt Promotion Upon completion of ALS, the graduate receives the ability to write performance reports on subordinates. This allows the graduate the ability to supervise regardless if he or she currently holds the rank of Staff Sergeant. Topics Covered Airman Leadership School covers Combat Leader, Military Professional, Supervisor of Airmen, verbal and written communication, and group dynamics.

The web frame forms a divider between drawers and provides a mounting point for the drawer runners. In some cabinets, a thin sheet of plywood is inserted into a groove in the web frame to serve as a dust cover between drawers. A basic web frame consists of a front rail which is usually visible from the front of the cabinet and two side rails which extend from the front to the rear of the cabinet. In many web frames, these side rails also serve as the drawer runners, on which the drawer itself slides. An optional rear rail may also be included. In fine cabinet work, the front rail is connected to the sides of the cabinet, or to vertical frame members, using sliding dovetails. In solid timber carcases, the side rails are housed in a dado in the cabinet sides and fixed only at the front to allow for seasonal movement. A screw in an elongated hole is used at the rear in such cases to hold the rail in position, whilst allowing for movement.

YMCA Jerusalem History Many of the UNSCOP sessions to decide the fate of Palestine were held at the YMCA In 1924, Archibald Clinton Harte, General Secretary of the International YMCA, raised the sum of one million dollars towards the construction of the building. Harte developed a vision for a permanent Y building and worked tirelessly planning every detail. For years, he cultivated donors who shared his vision of a ‚ÄúSermon in Stone.‚Äù After seven years of construction, the new Jerusalem YMCA was dedicated in 1933 with the words ‚ÄúHere is a place whose atmosphere is peace, where political and religious jealousies can be forgotten and international unity be fostered and developed.‚Äù Harte retired to his home on the shores of Galilee, which he bequeathed to the Jerusalem International YMCA as an international conference facility. The cornerstone was laid in 1928 by Lord Plumer, the British High Commissioner for Palestine, on a plot of land in the West Nikephoria section of Jerusalem, purchased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.YMCA history When the building opened on April 18, 1933, the event was attended by YMCA leaders from around the world. Details of the building, with its elegant arches, domes and tower, was described in the world press, which hailed it as a wellspring of cultural, athletic, social and intellectual life. Until 1991, the YMCA stadium was the only soccer stadium in Jerusalem. The building was designed by the American architect Arthur Loomis Harmon of Shreve, Lamb and Harmon, who designed the Empire State Building. The Jerusalem YMCA housed the city's first heated swimming pool and first gymnasium with a wooden floor. The first concert broadcasts of the Voice of Israel radio station were transmitted from the YMCA auditorium.History: Jerusalem International YMCA In 1947, the YMCA was the venue of the UNSCOP talks leading up to the UN Partition Plan.The Consul General at Jerusalem (Macatee) to the Secretary of State The stadium YMCA Stadium (Hebrew: ◊ê◊¶◊ò◊ì◊ô◊ï◊ü ◊ô◊û◊ß\\"◊ê, Itztadion Yimka) was the city's only sports stadium until 1991.

The site in the province of Sk√•ne is an area of considerable biodiversity supporting a number of rare species and has been designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) in Sweden as well as a Special Protection Area (SPA). The terrain is dominated by steep cliffs rising from the sea and rocky outcrops on the ridge above, the highest elevationLars Pahlsson, Kullaberg Naturteservat, AmuHadar Prepress, Malm√∂ (1997) being Mount H√•kull at 188 meters. Ridgetop vegetation includes a mixed hardwood broadleaf forest consisting of birch, beech, oak and pine trees with an understory of hawthorn, juniper, wild honeysuckle and blackthorn. Among the notable rare plants are spring vetchling, Lathyrus sphaericus.C.Michael Hogan, Kullaberg Nature Reserve, Sk√•ne, Sweden, Lumina Technologies Press, Aberdeen (2004) Inhabited as early as the Stone Age, there are extant stone circles, grave mounds, ancient village remains and other archeological features. Kullaberg is administered by the H√∂gan√§s Forestry Board and the Gyllenstierna Krapperup Foundation. Kullen lighthouse, designed by architect Magnus Dahlander in 1898, is considered the brightest in Sweden, situated at the westernmost point of the reserve, guiding ships through this busy part of the Kattegat. Within this 75 square kilometre (18,500 acre) reserve are extensive hiking paths that criss-cross the ridge and provide access to dozens of beach coves nestled at the bottom of the cliff formations. History Kullens fyr at the tip of Kullaberg Stone Age inhabitants were in southern Sweden at least as early as 7000 BC, from archaeological evidence on the mainland as well as the large island of √ñland. At Kullaberg clear evidence of habitation is found from tool findings, gravefields and stone circles. Later Iron Age peoples are also known to have inhabited the Kullaberg. The first written information about Kullaberg derives from about the year 1740 AD when Swedish naturalist Carl von Linne visited the area and recorded biological notes.Carl von Linne, Works and Notes (1742) In the early 18th century a private group almost acquired the Kullaberg with the intention of quarrying the rich stone resource. Foresighted early environmentalists intervened for a period of trustee years until a formal trust was created to own and manage the preserve. AB Kullabergs Natur was established in 1913 and acquired a portion of the lands on the peninsula. In 1968, a portion of the site was owned by the Krapperup Estate (owners of nearby Krapperup Castle), and, at that time, the tenant in tail, Gustaf Gyllenstierna, consigned the balance of Kullaberg to the Gyllenstierna Krapperup Foundation. Habitats and vegetation Grazing cattle on the seaside fell meadows The principal habitats include broadleaf deciduous forest and coniferous forest, specialized cliff habitat and marine habitat including intertidal zone. In the clear sea waters can be found crustaceans, sea urchins, mussels, snails and a variety of ocean fishes.Hoganas kommun, Database for Kullaberg, Administrative offices: Stadshusen, Centralgatan 20, 263 82 (2006) The rocky shoreline creates a natural environment for numerous tidepools that form at the cliff bases. In addition, freshwater marshes cover approximately five percent of the peninsula. Principal broadleaf trees include elm, ash, birch, beech and oak. The habitats are particularly varied since each direction of cliff face into the ocean (about 270 degrees in all) generating a slightly different microclimate exposure and hence a unique habitat. Not surprisingly then there are a number of rare plants present including keeled garlic and wild marjoram; the rare plant, grass pea or varvial (Lathyrus sphaericus) occurs only within Sweden at Kullaberg and one other location. Birdlife Coastal cliffs It is the rich avafauna that have primarily been responsible for the designations of IBA and SPA. Part of this IBA is a recognized international IBA. A variety of pelagic birds as well as terrestrial birds find their homes at Kullaberg. The preserve is a significant wintering and passage area for a number of seabirds and seaduck, including common eider (Somateria mollissima), common scoter (Melanita nigra), velvet scoter (Melanita fusca), common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), and black guillemot (Cepphus grylle).BirdLife On-line World Bird Database, BirdLife International, Kullaberg, SE056, Cambridge, UK (2005)BirdLife Important Bird Area Factsheet (2005) The rare red kite (Milvus milvus) finds good habitat for one or two breeding pairs (as of 1996) in this specialized coastal habitat of Kullaberg and causes the site to meet IBA criteria B3 and C6. The common guillemot, (Uria aalge), is found here, with the 1996 census recording 50 to 500 pairs, but not as a breeding location; although the habitat is considered marginal for this bird, criteria B1ii and C3 are nevertheless met. Further in the 1996 census 20 to 30 pairs of red-backed shrikes were noted at Kullaberg; while this shrike breeds here, with habitat value rated as medium, item C6 is met of the listing criteria. Practical information A paved road exists between the town of M√∂lle and a car park near the western tip of Kullaberg in the vicinity of the lighthouse. Along this road there are several other car park opportunities and a variety of trailheads leading to the numerous cliff paths and beach coves. Alternatively one may access hiking trails from the town of Molle itself or take a small boat from the harbour in Molle. Trivia * In the 1980s controversial wood sculptures called Nimis were constructed from driftwood, situated in one of the cove areas. While some people consider this an artistic addition to the nature reserve, others consider it unappealing and the sculptures were the subject of legal dispute over their removal. This dispute resulted in the founding of the micronation Ladonia. * The Swedish family of Kullenberg takes its name from Kullaberg, where the first known member of the family lived in the 16th century.

Their name was a paean to \\"white magic\\", contrary to the \\"black magic\\" of groups like Black Sabbath. As the band announced before their shows: \\"To bring good where there once was evil, to bring love where there once was hate, to bring wisdom where there once was ignorance; this is the power of White Witch\\". The group was inducted into the Florida Musicians Hall of Fame's Florida Music Honor Roll. History White Witch formed in 1971 in Tampa. The band originally featured lead singer Ronald \\"Ronn\\" (or \\"Ron\\") Goedert, guitarist Charles \\"Buddy\\" Richardson, keyboardist Hardin \\"Buddy\\" Pendergrass, drummer Robert \\"Bobby\\" Shea and bassist Loyall \\"Beau\\" Fisher. Several of the band members had belonged to a popular late-60s Tampa-area band called The Tropics. After touring small venues around the southeast for almost a year, White Witch signed with Capricorn Records, a label that included outfits such as the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall Tucker Band. Though somewhat uneasy about being the only non-southern rock performers signed to the label, the members agreed to the contract without a manager or any legal representation and quickly recorded their self-titled debut album in Capricorn's Macon, Georgia studios. The band toured extensively to support the record, opening for established acts such as Alice Cooper, Grand Funk Railroad, Billy Preston, and others. Fisher left the group sometime after the first album and was replaced by Rabbi Barbee, who left before the group went back in into the studio in 1974. Bassist Charlie Souza and drummer Bill Peterson also joined the band before the second album. Due to displeasure with their record label's lack of promotion and its interference in the band's recording sessions, Buddy Richardson left the group immediately after the second album (A Spiritual Greeting) was completed. He was replaced by guitarist George Brawley, who had spent the previous year as a session guitarist in Los Angeles after leaving the southern rock group Brother from Columbia, South Carolina. Drummer Bobby Shea stayed with the group as percussionist and back-up singer. White Witch did a bit more touring and recorded four tracks on demo, but broke up in the late 1970s before a third album was recorded. After White Witch, Goedert made some solo recordings, Pendergrass wrote commercial jingles and opened a recording studio, and Richardson played in other bands (\\"Revolver\\"). Some of the original group members began planning a reunion in the late 1990s which became impossible when lead singer Ron Goedert died of cancer on July 16, 2000. Pendergrass also became a victim of cancer on March 16, 2003. Music Though primarily known as a hard rock band, White Witch's music cannot be easily classified into a single genre. Songs on each album ranged from progressive rock and psychedelic to honky-tonk to southern boogie to pop rock. The band has also been described as \\"a prototype hair metal band\\". The common threads through their work were lyrics with a new age/spiritual theme and the use of an early moog synthesizer. Most of the songs on their first album were written by Goedert and Pendergrass, with contributions from the other band members. All of the songs on the second album were written by Goedert, Pendergrass, and Richardson. Both albums were released on CD in 1999. White Witch lead singer released Ron Goedert \\"Breaking All The Rules' in 1980 on Polydor Records and Frank Fenter record company, featuring Riff West on bass, Jack West on drums and Jerry Runyan on guitar the group toured with major acts Toto, Joe Perry, ZZ Top, and Mountain, before disbanding in late 1980. Intended to be the third White Witch LP, Polydor execs would not allow the use of the name owned by Capricorn, so the record was released under Goedert's name. It has never been distributed on CD and is available only on vinyl.

Lower frequency drivers or subwoofers are designed to move more air and have more excursion than those of higher frequency. If a speaker is pushed beyond its limits, overexcursion, or \\"bottoming out,\\" can occur as the voice coil either slips out of the magnetic gap or hits the bottom of it. Often, large speakers such as those used in clubs and in professional audio actually allow little cone excursion and/or they have fairly stiff surrounds that do not allow them to fluctuate greatly without high power. This is because they would otherwise overdrive and have a much shorter lifetime because it doesn't take much power at very low frequencies to cause even a large and \\"powerful\\" loudspeaker to overfluctuate.

The area has the largest hot springs in the commonwealth, and the resort is also known for its championship golf courses, which have hosted several national tournaments. The resort also includes an alpine ski resort; founded in 1959, it is the oldest in Virginia. The resort has been designated a National Historic Landmark; it has a history extending more than two and a half centuries. The Omni Homestead Resort is a member of Historic Hotels of America the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History The Homestead in 1903 Old wing of the resort in 2016 Lobby of the resort in 2016 In 1766, Thomas Bullitt built a lodge on the site, which is considered the founding of The Homestead. In 1832, Dr. Thomas Goode (physician) purchased the land from the Bullitt family and expanded the medical therapies, establishing a European style of spa treatment and hydrotherapy. It has hosted vacationers ever since, including twenty-three U.S. presidents. The modern resort dates from 1888-1892, when a group of investors headed by J. P. Morgan bought the business and started rebuilding it from the ground up. The original hotel buildings burned down in 1901 caused by a fire in the bakery. The main Homestead hotel was constructed afterwards, one wing a year, with the main lobby reconstructed in 1902. Many American Presidents and influential people were Homestead guests. William Howard Taft spent July and August, 1908 at the Homestead, working and relaxing before the final campaign push, as did outgoing President Theodore Roosevelt, for a short period of time.D.K. Goodwin, The Bully Pulpit, pp. 547-548, 558 Other notable guests included cartoonist Carl E. Schultze of Foxy Grandpa fame. From December 1941 until June 1942, following the United States' entry into World War II, the Homestead served as a high-end internment camp for 785 Japanese diplomats and their families until they could be exchanged through neutral channels for their American counterparts.\\"The Homestead: A Great Hotel Entertains Jap Diplomats as a Patriotic Duty,\\" Life Magazine, 1942-02-16, at p. 68. The diplomats were later transferred to the Greenbrier Hotel in West Virginia. In 1943, during World War II, The Homestead hosting a very important conference of the United Nations in which was implemented the foundation of Food and Agriculture Organization... In 1993, The Homestead was purchased by Club Resorts, the same company which owned the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina. In 2006, Club Resorts and its parent company ClubCorp, Inc. were acquired by a private-equity group led by KSL Capital Partners, LLC. KSL Resorts assumed management of The Homestead at this time. KSL sold the resort to Omni Hotels in 2013 and it was renamed The Omni Homestead Resort. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Associated with The Homestead are the Homestead Dairy Barns, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Golf Cascades Course logo The Homestead features two golf courses. The club is sometimes referred to as Virginia Hot Springs Golf & Tennis Club. The Old Course started as a six-hole layout in 1892, and the first tee is the oldest in continuous use in the United States. It was expanded to 18 holes by 1901, and Donald Ross redesigned it in 1913. The course has been modified at various times since, and the current course has six par 5s and six par 3s. The Cascades Course is the most famous of the two, and is usually ranked among the top 100 U.S. courses by both Golf Digest and GOLF Magazine. The Cascades is the course used when hosting national tournaments, including seven United States Golf Association championships. It was designed by William S. Flynn (who was also a main architect for Shinnecock Hills), and opened in 1923. There was formerly a third course, the Lower Cascades, which was designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. in 1963. It hosted qualifying rounds for the U.S. Amateur tournament. It was closed following the 2012 season. Famed PGA Tour champion Sam Snead lived in or near Hot Springs all of his life, and served for decades as the Homestead's golf pro. =Tournaments= * 1928 U.S. Women's Amateur, won by Glenna Collett * 1932 National Intercollegiate Championship, won by Yale (team) and Johnny Fischer (individual) * 1966 Curtis Cup, won by the United States over Great Britain & Ireland 13-5 * 1967 U.S. Women's Open, won by Catherine Lacoste * 1980 U.S. Senior Amateur, won by William C.

There are also a number of formal and informal dining options available on premises. Ski resort The ski area at The Homestead was opened in 1959; it is the oldest ski resort in Virginia. The resort's main and only northwest-facing slope is serviced by three lifts, including a double chairlift which accesses the intermediate and advanced terrain at the top of the hill, and two surface lifts which serve the beginner terrain at the bottom and at the tubing hill. The chairlift has a mid-mountain drop-off station which accesses intermediate terrain. The resort offers a variety of other winter activities including snow tubing. = _Statistics:_ = Elevation * Summit Elevation: * Base Elevation: * Vertical Rise: Terrain * Skiable area: * Runs: 10 total  35% beginner  55% intermediate  10% advanced * Longest run: * Annual snowfall: Resort capacity * Lift system: 3 lifts total  1 double chairlift  1 rope tows  I conveyor * Uphill lift capacity: 1,143 skiers/hour * Snowmaking: 100% of trails Ice skating rink The resort originally featured an Olympic sized skating rink that closed when the Zamboni became unusable. In 2008, the Homestead built a new 30 X 20 foot ice skating rink in time for the 2008-2009 winter season. In 2013, the ice rink was relocated to Allegheny Springs, adjacent to the outdoor pool. March 2009 shooting On March 21, 2009 two resort employees were shot and killed in the hotel kitchen; the community of Hot Springs was briefly locked down under code red procedures as a security precaution. Authorities identified fellow employee Beacher Ferrel Hackney as a suspect in the killings. The slayings were the first homicides in Bath County since 1983. On September 2, 2012, Hackney's remains, clothing, some personal possessions, and pistol were found near the Homestead's Lower Cascades golf course. The cause of death has not been determined.

Howard's Hyborian Age. Contents *\\"The Reluctant Shaman\\" :Virgil Hathaway, an Algonquian Indian running a souvenir shop in Gahato, New York, is stuck with the task of babysitting a band of stone-throwing sprites from the Iroquois country. When they begin terrorizing the town in their efforts to be \\"helpful\\" he has to bone up quickly on Iroquoian magic in order to control them. *\\"The Hardwood Pile\\" :When Dan Pringle's Gahato sawmill processes a tree harboring a dryad, the spirit, having no other home, remains with the resulting pile of lumber, \\"haunting\\" it to prevent its dispersal.

After Ugaph is nearly caught attempting to rob the Temple of Ip, he and Gezun plot to con the Typhonians by pretending to represent a new god, Ka the Appalling, who requires offerings.

The two are separate municipalities. The first, a town that was settled in 1710 as a colonial English village in the Province of New Jersey, that in 1773 adopted a name change to \\"Chatham\\". There are numerous references to this village as \\"Chatham, New Jersey\\" dating from that time. The second, more southern, without a town center, and less densely populated, is the vestige of a regional government that was formed in 1806 as a township, a form of municipal government peculiar to the state of New Jersey. It had jurisdiction over a region including a large area of open space and several villages. One of those, the village of Chatham, dating from 1710, was the source for its name, Chatham Township. Chatham Township shares various joint public services with Chatham Borough: the school district, the library, the municipal court, the medical emergency squad, and recreation program.

On August 19, 1892, the citizens of Chatham reincorporated with another type of village government offered as an alternative within townships by New Jersey. The village of Chatham then reincorporated for governance as a borough by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 1, 1897 with complete independence from Chatham Township. Shared services Chatham Township shares various joint public services with Chatham Borough: the school district (created in 1986), the library (since 1974), the municipal court (created 2010), the medical emergency squad (since 1936), and the decades long, recreation program. =Public schools= Chatham Borough and Chatham Township held elections in November 1986 to consider joining their separate school districts.

Lum, bequeathed $30,000 upon his death in 1924 for the construction of the library as a memorial to his own father, John H. Eastwood, Sr., and Ralph E. Lum‚Äôs father, Frederick H. Lum, who were close friends. The building was dedicated as the Chatham Public Library, and it opened to the public in 1924. Residents of Chatham Borough were able to join. This location continues to house the library. As the population of Chatham Township began to grow in the 1960s, services were extended to students in the township elementary school. In 1974, a referendum was placed on the November ballot for Jointure, which was to form a library for both towns. The measure passed and the library began to serve all township residents as well. The library, renamed the Library of The Chathams, now serves both municipalities. The library is administered by six trustees, who are appointed jointly by the councils of both municipalities and their mayors (or their representatives), as well as a representative from the joint school district.Library of the Chathams ‚Äì History In 1985 the library joined the Morris Automated Information Network (MAIN), an electronic database linking together all the public libraries in Morris County. An expansion costing nearly $4,000,000 (with the governments of both Chatham Borough and Chatham Township contributing a combined $2,000,000) was completed and dedicated on January 11, 2004. The library also has a 9/11 memorial with 7 doves to represent the 7 citizens who lost their lives on that tragic day in New York City. =Municipal court= Chatham Township and Chatham Borough are members of the Borough of Madison Joint Municipal Court, which also has jurisdiction over Harding Township.

Career  Train with eyes by Tadanori Yokoo, 2005 Okanoyama museum Tadanori Yokoo, born in Nishiwaki, Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan, in 1936, is one of Japan's most successful and internationally recognized graphic designers and artists. He began his career as a stage designer for avant garde theatre in Tokyo. His early work shows the influence of the New York-based Push Pin Studio (Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast in particular), but Yokoo cites filmmaker Akira Kurosawa and writer Yukio Mishima as two of his most formative influences. In the late 1960s he became interested in mysticism and psychedelia, deepened by travels in India. Because his work was so attuned to 1960s pop culture, he has often been (unfairly) described as the \\"Japanese Andy Warhol\\" or likened to psychedelic poster artist Peter Max, but Yokoo's complex and multi-layered imagery is intensely autobiographical and entirely original. By the late 60s he had achieved international recognition for his work and was included in the 1968 \\"Word & Image\\" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Four years later MoMA mounted a solo exhibition of his graphic work organized by Mildred Constantine.Heller, Steven \\"Mildred Constantine, 95, MoMA Curator, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, December 16, 2008. Yokoo collaborated extensively with Sh≈´ji Terayama and his theater Tenj≈ç Sajiki. He starred as a protagonist in Nagisa Oshima's film Diary of a Shinjuku Thief.

As a descendant of an old Jewish family from medieval Toledo, Samuel (Sam) Toledano was a secretary-general and president of Spain's Jewish federation of Israelite communities from 1982‚Äì1994. For 36 years, he was one of the most prominent Jewish leaders in Spain. Early life Toledano was born in Tangier on August 15, 1929. He graduated with a law degree from the University of Paris and moved to Spain in 1959.  Career  In 1967, the Spanish authorities (represented by the Spanish ambassador in Cairo) √Ångel Sagaz, issued passports for about 1,500 Jews imprisoned in Egypt's Abu Zaabal prison. He obtained their liberation from Nasser's government in response to his request to the vice president of the Jewish community of Madrid and its president, Max Mazin (in office between 1961‚Äì1970), Freedom for non-Catholic faiths was achieved on June 19, 1967. As a political consequence in Spain of the Second Vatican Council decisions. Toledano then demanded that the Spanish State give full legal recognition for Spanish Jews and overturn the Spanish Inquisition expulsion order, which was decreed in 1492. On December 16, 1968, he received from Minister of Justice Antonio Oriol a government proclamation formally revoking the Catholic Monarchs' Alhambra Decree that ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews. That day, the Beth Yaacov Synagogue, the first official synagogue in Madrid since the 1492 decree, was inaugurated. In 1987 Toledano took part in negotiations between the Government of Spain and representatives of the Jewish and Protestant faiths to grant those faiths the same privileges as the Catholic Church. The agreement was signed in 1990. On March 31, 1992, he was among the Jewish leaders from around the world who welcomed King Juan Carlos I at his famous visit to a synagogue in Madrid. This royal reconciliation gesture came on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the Alhambra Decree. In June 1992, Toledano spoke in the name of the vast \\"tribe\\" of Toledano exiled Jewish families around the world and, together with some other 19 representatives, received a symbolic key to the town of Toledo in a historical public ceremony. Toledano was active in efforts to reconcile the Jewish and the Spanish nations, and in this context, Spain's official recognition in 1987 of the State of Israel and the institution of diplomatic relations at the embassy rank between the two Mediterranean states. He was a founding member of the Center for Judeo-Christian Studies in Madrid. He was also involved in business, serving as a board member and financial director of Jusan company in Madrid.  Personal life  He died of a heart attack in Madrid, Spain, on July 22, 1996. He was married twice and had two children, Danny and Mauricio Toledano, and three grandchildren. In his memory, the Samuel Toledano Prize was founded, which is awarded every year by the Misgav Yerushalayim Institute in Jerusalem to people from Spain, Israel, and other countries who contribute to the research of the Sefardic heritage and its Christian and Muslim context.

The acronym, NAME, originally stood for the Nuclear Accident ModEl. The Met Office has revised and upgraded the model over the years and it is now used as a general purpose dispersion model. The current version is known as the NAME III (Numerical Atmospheric dispersion Modeling Environment) model. NAME III is currently operational and it will probably completely replace the original NAME model sometimes in 2006. Features and capabilities of NAME NAME (in its current NAME III version) is a Lagrangian air pollution dispersion model for short range to global range scales. It employs 3-dimensional meteorological data provided by the Met Office's Unified National Weather Prediction Model. Random walk techniques using empirical turbulence profiles are utilized to represent turbulent mixing. In essence, NAME follows the 3-dimensional trajectories of parcels of the pollution plume and computes pollutant concentrations by Monte Carlo methods ‚Äî that is, by direct simulation rather than solving equations. NAME uses a puff technique when modelling dispersion over a short range which shortens the time needed to compute the pollutant concentrations at the receptors. The model has the capability to calculate: the rise of buoyant plumes; deposition of pollution plume components due to rainfall (i.e., wet deposition); dry deposition; plume chemistry focusing on sulphate and nitrate chemistry; plume depletion via the decay of radioactive materials; the downwash effects of buildings. The model can also be run 'backwards' to generate maps that locate possible plume originating sources. The Met Office's commitments to emergency response service The Met Office has international commitments Met Office Emergency Response Capability to provide emergency response dispersion modelling services for releases of hazardous gases and materials into the atmosphere. Such events include the release of radioactive materials and emissions from erupting volcanoes. Those commitments are met by an operational group known as EMARC who are supported by a Met Office team of dispersion modelling staff. That team is also responsible for the scientific development of NAME III which, combined with the Met Office numerical weather prediction model, is used to provide the dispersion modelling services needed to implement the listed commitments: *The WMO (World Meteorological Office) has designated the Met Office to operate one of the worldwide RSMCs (Regional Specialist Meteorological Centre) *The Met Office has also been designated a VAAC (Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre) which is part of the IAVW (International Airways Volcano Watch) set up by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). Over the years, NAME has been applied to radioactive releases, the Kuwaiti oil fires, major industrial fires and chemical spills, and two volcanic eruptions in Iceland.

He produced Australia's first comprehensive bird field guide What Bird is That?. In 1960 it was rated the all-time best seller in Australian natural history and remains a classic birding reference to this day. Early years Born in Yamba, New South Wales, in January 1886, he was the son of ornithologist and bird artist Neville Henry Cayley born Caley, and consequently signed his name as Neville W. Cayley in his professional years. Cayley's family moved to Sydney in the mid-1890s, where he studied art and was a pivotal member in the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club. In 1918, his first work, the booklet Our Birds was published. Our Flowers and The Tale of Bluey Wren followed, both published in 1926. In the same period (1925‚Äì26), Cayley began illustrating birds‚Äô eggs for the Australian Encyclopaedia. Groundbreaking work Cayley's big breakthrough came in 1931 when he published his most celebrated work: What Bird is That? It was the first comprehensive field guide to Australian birds and included full-colour paintings of each species, setting the benchmark for all Australian field guides to come. It remained the only available field guide from the 1930s (the first edition was issued in 1931) to the 1960s. Rather than create another book for birding's elite, Cayley wanted to create one that was accessible to beginners. To this end, he organised the birds by habitat, which made them easy to find and identify, and included concise information on bird distribution, behaviour and breeding.Cayley, Neville (2011) What Bird Is That? Sydney. Australia's Heritage Publishing, pv The book became a classic, has been reprinted and repackaged in many formats, and remains in print to this day. Following the success of What Bird is That? Cayley published a number of other bird titles as well as paintings for What Butterfly is That? (1932) and Furred Animals of Australia (1941). Cayley favoured watercolours and his vibrant pictures were steeped in sunlight and shadow. He often used bird specimens from the Australian Museum as reference, and noted on the back of artwork which particular specimen he had used.Boles, Walter. (2010).

Sadly, the project was incomplete at the time of his death, despite the illustrations being all but finished. In 1984, noted ornithologist Terence Lindsey picked up where Cayley had left off, incorporating these illustrations into a revised and expanded edition of What Bird is That?

It is published by Hakusensha in the magazine Young Animal and collected in 8 tank≈çbon volumes. The series has been adapted into a 24-episode anime television series by Nomad, airing in 2006 and released on 8 DVDs. It is also known as Chokotto Sister and Chocosis. Plot The story centers around a Christmas wish made by a young Haruma Kawagoe, who was eagerly anticipating having a baby sister, after his mother suffered a miscarriage followed by a hysterectomy. Several years later, when Haruma is a college student, a woman on a flying motorbike claiming to be Santa Claus delivers his wish, a younger sister. When he remarks that he made his wish a long time ago, \\"Santa\\" replies that making a little sister takes a lot more time than just making an android, takes his signature for delivery, and departs. Haruma now has a little sister, who comes with her own instruction manual ‚Äî a manual for how to be a little sister, that is. When she asks him to name her, he calls her Choko, which refers to the Japanese word for \\"manual\\". Characters ; : : The main character, who is the little sister that \\"Santa\\" delivers to Haruma. She is a sweet and very innocent girl who appears to be about 10 years younger than Haruma, making her anywhere from 10‚Äì13. As the series begins all of her knowledge of the world is derived from an instruction manual that she was given before her delivery to Haruma's home. The manual does not cover all situations and was not really written for someone of Choko's level of experience as some of the information is quite inappropriate for someone of her age. Choko is very fond of her new \\"onii-chan\\" (an affectionate term for an older brother), as she immediately calls Haruma. She is always trying to be number one in his affections but, over time, learns that she can not be her brother's favorite in all situations. She is accepting of Chitose as her brother's girlfriend and later, his wife, after she comes to this realization. :No mention is ever made of how Haruma explains or is going to explain the appearance of a younger sister to his parents. ; : : A young man who is going to university. When he was a child his mother miscarried and had to have a hysterectomy to save her life. He prayed to God that his mother would recover and made a wish to Santa that he would \\"stand in\\" for his mother and deliver him a little sister. Now, years later, his wish has been granted, leaving Haruma with a sudden addition to his meager household. He comes to care a great deal for his new sister and considers her to be extremely cute. He, himself, has a crush on Ayano Sonozaki, the owner of the local flower shop, but is heartbroken after she decides to return to her former love. In the manga he has a cousin named Konatsu who has a crush on him but gives up on him after learning that Chitose loves him. After Chitose goes to an omiai, a meeting between unmarried individuals, at her aunt's insistence, he realizes how much he cares for her and confesses his feelings for her. The anime never explicitly reveals whether they remain together but at the end of the manga Choko tells a new tenant that she is onii-chan and onee-chan's little sister, from which one can conclude that Haruma and Chitose are married. ; : : The granddaughter of the original landlady. She is a nice, but somewhat shy and accident-prone young woman who has no sense of direction. She also has feelings of insecurity due to having to wear glasses and is discontent with her appearance; she suffered a painful episode in school when she overheard the boy she liked calling her \\"an ugly girl with glasses\\". Several characters remark upon the impressive size of her bust. She develops a crush on Haruma after he says that her glasses suit her very well. In the end of manga, she is presumed to have married Haruma. ; : : A young woman who lives in Tsubaki manor, the same building where Haruma, Choko and Yasuoka live. She sports orange hair, enjoys liquor, teases Haruma with her (lack of) wardrobe and claims that he is interested in her body. Despite her penchant for inebriation, her laziness, her tendency to mooch any and all kinds of food off of her neighbors, her \\"adult\\" sense of humor and a somewhat scheming, manipulative nature, she seems to have a good character. She came to the original landlady's rescue after the latter took a spill down a staircase, spraining her ankle and waist. She has displayed a rather uncomfortable and intrusive interest in Chitose's bust. She is actually a gravure model and her professional name is Otokami Arisa (her real name backwards), but she keeps this knowledge from her neighbors. ; : : Haruma's neighbor in Tsubaki manor, a middle-aged man whose existence Haruma had forgotten about until they meet at a local shrine on the New Year's Day after Choko's appearance. Yasuoka is unemployed and appears to be struggling to find a new job after having lost his wife and daughter about a year before the present. In the manga, he eventually finds a job and everybody in the manor celebrates his good fortune. ; : : A woman who runs Ciel blue de fleur, a flower shop near Tsabuki manor (the literal French translation is \\"sky blue of flower\\" (although 'bleu' is misspelled). Given the poor grammar, it is uncertain exactly what the name is intended to mean; 'blue flowers the colour of the sky' or 'sky, the colour of blue flowers' are both valid interpretations, but 'sky-blue flower' is probably most likely). Ayano's dream has always been to open her own flower shop. Haruma has a crush on her, but has so far been unable to work up the nerve to do anything about it. She remains oblivious to Haruma's affections and sees him as no more than a good acquaintance. She was engaged to Kazuya until he broke it off, to her considerable distress. Haruma gives her advice which allows her to rekindle her relationship with Kazuya and they eventually marry, which leaves Haruma heartbroken. ; : : A young boy around Choko's age, who is somewhat shy. He unintentionally saves Choko from a nasty fall and soon develops a strong crush on her. He works at his family's public bath and lives on the premises with three older sisters. ; : : A young girl who appears to be around Choko's age or a little younger. She is from a rich family and lives alone in a big house with only a maid who tends to her since her father is often away on business. She is forced to take on many activities typically associated with the upper classes including: ballet, violin lessons, home schooling with a tutor, and conversational English lessons, all of which she dislikes. She meets Choko while playing hooky from her lessons. Even though she does not really like Choko at first, she comes to care for Choko as they get to know each other better. However, Yurika is unsure of how to show her feelings and often denies her affection for Choko. She initially objects to Choko's nickname for her, \\"Yuri-pyon\\", but eventually gets used to it. She has a crush on Kakeru but he is oblivious to her feelings. In the manga, it is revealed that her mother died after being hit by a car just before Christmas. She was on her way to buy a music box that Yurika wanted to give to her father as a present. Understandably, this caused her to hate Christmas, since if the holiday didn't exist, her mother wouldn't have died while shopping for a present. ; : : A young woman who is Haruma's \\"senpai\\" (upperclassman) both at school and in the club he belongs to. Tamami gives the impression of being quite free-spirited. She helps Haruma and other fellow students find part-time jobs (often on short notice) but Haruma is not fond of them as they tend to be \\"too busy\\" or not pay as much as he would like. ; : The original manager of Tsubaki manor, where Haruma, Choko, Yasuoka, and Makoto all live. She has no other name and is a kind-faced widow who is getting on in years and seems quite easy-going. She decides to retire from her duties in the building after her accident and goes live with her son and daughter-in-law, stating that the accident has shown her that she is getting too old for it. She gives over her duties to her granddaughter. She is the person who inspired Choko to start a pictorial diary. ; : :The man who was previously engaged to Ayano and used to hold a position as illustrator with a magazine. He was forced to return to the country to take over the family inn because his father died and there were no other heirs. He decided to cancel his engagement to Ayano because he didn't want to spoil her dream of owning a flower shop by asking her to come with him. This caused Ayano considerable heartache. Eventually he reconsiders and the two of them marry and look after the inn together. ; : : Claiming to be Santa Claus, she is a rather tough-looking woman who rides a flying motorbike with reindeer antler-style handlebars and who does not have much time for chitchat or objections. She makes Haruma sign for the big bundle of joy she brought him, wrapped up in a bag with a ribbon, then flies off, stating that he should present any and all complaints to God. She also makes a reappearance, in Haruma's nightmare where she comes to reclaim Choko and hands Haruma some gift certificates in exchange. In the final episode her real face is revealed before she goes off handing out Christmas presents on Christmas Eve. ; : : A mature woman whom Choko first encounters in the public bath where Kakeru lives and works. She is a woman of firm convictions about the proper way to behave in a public bath, among other things. Although she has a similar appearance to \\"Santa\\" they are not the same person. In the manga it is Kakeru's grandmother who taught her about bath etiquette.

History As Oakland Mayor, Jerry Brown continued his predecessor Elihu Harris' public policy of supporting downtown housing development in the area defined as the Central Business District in Oakland's 1998 General Plan. Brown believed that downtown area should attract people who leave it at the end of their workday. Since Brown worked toward the stated goal of bringing an additional 10,000 residents to Downtown Oakland, his plan became known as \\"10K.\\" It has resulted in redevelopment projects in the Jack London District, where Brown purchased and later sold an industrial warehouse which he used as a personal residence, and in the Lakeside Apartments District near Lake Merritt, where two infill projects were proposed and approved. The 10k plan has touched the historic Old Oakland district, the Chinatown district, the Uptown district, and Downtown. An Uptown Project, had been criticized in the press for diverting over $60 million in affordable housing to fund luxury housing units, built by Forest City Enterprises. In 2010, The New York Times reported that the 10K plan was still incomplete nearly 4 years after Brown left Oakland. At the time of writing, the city completed just 3,549 units from projects approved during the Brown years. In March 2014, Mayor Jean Quan announced her own 10K plan.

It originally aired on the Fox network on . It was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology, or overarching fictional history. \\"Soft Light\\" received a Nielsen rating of 8.5 and was watched by 8.1 million households. The episode generally received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, an ex-student of Scully's (Kate Twa) asks the agents to help her with her first investigation concerning a number of disappearances with very few clues. Mulder ponders the idea of spontaneous human combustion but rethinks it when they find a man, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub), who is afraid of his own shadow. Banton is a scientist researching dark matter, and his shadow has somehow developed the ability to disintegrate people who come across it. \\"Soft Light\\" was the first The X-Files episode written by Gilligan, who would go on to write several acclaimed episodes such as \\"Pusher\\", \\"Bad Blood\\" and \\"Memento Mori\\". \\"Soft Light\\" was one of the first episodes written by someone not on the main writing staff for The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow to be able to move independently, but it was rewritten to save on animation costs. In addition, the character of X (Steven Williams) was not in the script initially. His character was added to give Banton a legitimate fear of the government.  Plot  At a hotel in Richmond, Virginia, Chester Ray Banton (Tony Shalhoub) reaches a room and frantically knocks on the door while shouting the name ‚Ä≥Morris‚Ä≥. Banton's shouts attract the attention of Patrick Newirth, a guest in the room across the hall. When Newirth looks through his door's peephole, Banton steps back, causing his shadow to slip beneath Newirth's door. Newirth suddenly evaporates, leaving a strange burn mark on the floor. Banton realizes what has happened and flees the scene. The case of Newirth's death, the latest in several of its kind, is assigned to local detective Kelly Ryan (Kate Twa). She seeks help from Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), her former instructor at the FBI Academy. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) also takes part in the investigation, believing Newirth died from spontaneous human combustion. While searching the home of an earlier victim, the agents realize that both she and Newirth had recently traveled by train. Meanwhile, Banton sits in a train station, cautiously looking at the floor; because the room is lit by soft light, his shadow cannot be seen. After he leaves, Banton is confronted by two police officers patrolling the area. Despite Banton's warnings, the officers step into his shadow and disappear, leaving more burn marks. The following day, while reviewing the station's surveillance tapes, Mulder sees footage of Banton staring at the floor. After blowing up the frame, Mulder sees the logo for a company called Polarity Magnetics on Banton's jacket. At Polarity Magnetics, the agents meet scientist Christopher Davey (Kevin McNulty), who identifies Banton, a physicist conducting research into dark matter. Davey reveals that Banton disappeared five weeks earlier after an incident in his laboratory in which he was locked in a target room with an active particle accelerator and exposed to a large amount of subatomic particles. His account is enough for Scully to consider spontaneous human combustion, but Mulder is now doubtful of this theory. The agents find Banton at the train station, but he runs to a poorly lit area. He declares that walking into his shadow will kill the agents, so Mulder shoots out the overhead lights. Banton allows himself to be taken to a mental hospital, where he is put in a room with soft light per his own request. He tells the agents that the accident in his lab caused his shadow to behave like a black hole, splitting atoms into component particles and reducing matter into pure energy. Banton claims that the deaths were all accidents, and that the government wants to exploit him. Ryan and her superior stop the questioning and declare the case closed, despite Mulder's objections. Mulder contacts X (Steven Williams), who assures him that the government has no interest in Banton. However, X and two associates later attempt to remove Banton from the hospital by cutting the power. In the process, X's associates are killed when the emergency lights turn on and Banton's shadow falls upon them. Banton flees from the hospital. Banton returns to Polarity Magnetics and is confronted by Ryan, whom he reluctantly kills with his shadow when she tries to arrest him. Banton orders Davey to destroy him with the particle accelerator, but Davey reveals that he has been helping the government hunt him down. Davey locks Banton in with the particle accelerator, but is shot by X. Mulder and Scully arrive soon after, seemingly too late to save Banton from being vaporized by the accelerator; Mulder realizes that X has betrayed him, and tells X to never contact him again. The case is considered closed, but Mulder notes that Davey disappeared after the incidents. The episode ends as X enters a research facility where experiments are being performed on a despairing Banton.Lowry, pp. 219‚Äì21.  Production  Tony Shalhoub guest starred in the episode as Dr. Banton. \\"Soft Light\\" was written by Vince Gilligan and directed by James A. Contner. Prior to writing this episode, Gilligan, who had long been a fan of the show, learned that his agent was a relative of series creator Chris Carter. Thanks to this connection, he was allowed to meet Carter. During this meet, Carter asked Gilligan if he had any episode ideas, to which quickly noted that he had been observing his shadow and thought it would be \\"creepy\\" if it began moving independently. Carter asked Gilligan to develop a script based on the idea as a freelance project (although when the episode was finished, Carter offered Gilligan a job as a permanent writer). This episode was thus one of the first episodes to be written by someone from outside the main writing staff of The X-Files. Originally, the script called for Banton's shadow to be able to move independently; Carter and writer Howard Gordon rewrote the story to remove this aspect, which ended up \\"sav[ing] an enormous amount of money in animation costs\\", according to Gilligan.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 66. After reading the first draft, Carter also felt that Banton's fear of having the government control him should be \\"more than just paranoia\\".Lowry, p. 221. He thus wrote X into the story; writer Frank Spotnitz later noted, \\"It had been a long time since X had done anything and the character really needed to grow.\\" Gilligan himself inserted a reference to the villain Eugene Victor Tooms from the first-season episodes \\"Squeeze\\" and \\"Tooms\\" in a conversation between Ryan and Mulder.Edwards, p. 308. The episode guest stars Tony Shalhoub as Dr. Banton. Shalhoub, who had a recurring role on the NBC series Wings, was not familiar with The X-Files when he was offered the part because at the time he did not watch much television. However, after reading the script for \\"Soft Light\\", he enjoyed the story due to its The Twilight Zone-esque nature. When Shalhoub informed people that he had secured a part in The X-Files, he claimed that \\"the response was unbelievable\\". Shalhoub was impressed with the on-location filming that the series did; he noted, \\"Ninety-nine percent of our filming on Wings is done on a soundstage, while most of [The X-Files] is shot on location in and around Vancouver. It's an ideal city because it gives producers so many options.\\" Both the Pacific Central Station and the Pacific Marine Training Institute in Vancouver stood in for the train station featured in the episode. Initially, the Pacific Marine Training Institute would only give the series permission to film after 5pm, but the show's producers eventually talked the dean of the station into letting production begin at 2 in the afternoon. Because he was a fan of the series, Gilligan traveled to Vancouver and video recorded the filming of \\"Soft Light\\".Gradnitzer and Pittson, p. 77. Broadcast and reception \\"Soft Light\\" was originally aired in the United States on the Fox Broadcasting Company on May 5, 1995, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on February 13, 1996 on BBC One. In its original broadcast, it was watched by 8.1 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received an 8.5 rating and 15 share among viewers, meaning that 8.5 percent of all households in the United States and 15 percent of all people watching television at the time, viewed the episode.Lowry, p. 249. \\"Soft Light\\" received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\" and noted that the episode \\"gains points for the obscure subject matter\\" but \\"loses them for the strained conspiratorial element\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also gave it a \\"B‚Äì\\". He praised the cold open for its strangeness and X's involvement, but thought that the explanation for Banton's shadow was not satisfactorily fleshed out. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the episode's case, calling it one wherein \\"Mulder and Scully get to investigate properly, coming up with theories that they later build on or retract.\\" Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the episode's conclusion, noting that \\"there's no better illustration for distrusting the government than the brilliant closing scene\\" which features Shalhoub \\"fixed to a chair, bombarded with flashes of light, as one single tear rolls down his terrified face.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 52. Other reviews were decidedly more critical. John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Overall, this episode falls short due to a completely ludicrous central concept, only partially countered by an interesting resolution highlighting the more sinister side of Informant X. Much like last season‚Äôs final few episodes, this season is ending with plenty of hints that Mulder and Scully are pushing the wrong buttons.\\" Footnotes Bibliography  *  External links  *\\"Soft Light\\" at TheXFiles.com * * Category:1995 American television episodes Category:Television episodes written by Vince Gilligan Category:The X-Files (season 2) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Virginia Category:Spontaneous human combustion in fiction ","title":"Soft Light (The X-Files)"},{"id":"6604644","text":"Collins View is a neighborhood in the Southwest section of Portland, Oregon.

Prominent examples include 1819 and 1868, as well as the decades of the 1890s and 1970s ‚Äî the latter especially in North America ‚Äî and the 2010s in the United Kingdom. 1819 Quadracycle The first period which may be called a bicycle craze actually refers to a precursor of the bicycle which was pushed along by the feet on the ground as in walking, and did not have pedals. This machine was invented by Baron Karl von Drais in Germany, and was called variously a \\"draisine\\" (English) or \\"draisienne\\" (French) after his name, a \\"velocipede\\" from the Latin terms for \\"fast foot\\", a \\"hobby horse\\", or a \\"dandy horse\\", the last name being perhaps the most popular. Drais got a patent for his invention in 1818, and the craze swept Europe and the United States during the summer of 1819 while many manufacturers (notably Denis Johnson of London) either copied Drais's machine or created their own versions, then quickly died out as many pedestrians began to feel threatened by the machines and municipalities enacted laws prohibiting their use. During the next 43 years, chiefly in England, inventors continued to explore the concept of human-powered transport, but on vehicles with three or four wheels (called \\"tricycles\\" and \\"quadracycles\\" respectively), which were thought to be more stable, not requiring the balance that is necessary for two-wheeled vehicles. But none of these achieved much popularity.. 1860s and 1870s In the early 1860s the first true bicycle was created in Paris, France, by attaching rotary cranks and pedals to the front wheel hub of a dandy-horse. The Olivier brothers recognized the commercial potential of this invention, and set up a partnership with blacksmith and bicycle maker Pierre Michaux, using Michaux's name, already famous among enthusiasts of the new sport, for the company. They began the first mass-production of bicycles (still called \\"velocipedes\\") in 1868, as the first real bicycle craze had begun the year before, reaching full force all over Europe and America in 1868 and 1869. But exactly as with the dandy-horse, pedestrians complained about them, and the craze again faded quickly. Another factor in their demise was the extremely uncomfortable ride, because of the stiff wrought-iron frame and wooden wheels surrounded by tires made of iron ‚Äî this led to the pejorative name \\"boneshaker\\", which is still used today to refer to this type of bicycle. Again, England was the only place where the concept remained popular during the early 1870s. But the design changed drastically, with the front wheel becoming larger and larger, and with many other improvements making the ride more comfortable. This type of bicycle was known in its day as the \\"ordinary\\", but people later began calling it a \\"penny-farthing\\" because of the resemblance of its wheel sizes to the largest and smallest English copper coins of the time; it is also known as a \\"high-wheel\\". Front-wheel sizes quickly grew to as much as 5 feet (~1.5 meters), and the bicycles were considered by the general public to be quite dangerous. In addition, they were expensive, and thus riders were mostly wealthy young men who formed an elite brotherhood. However, bicycle races were staged and well-attended by the public, which spread interest for the high-wheeler worldwide because of the far-flung British colonies, by the end of the decade. Albert Pope purchased Lallement's original patent and created his \\"Columbia\\" bicycle in the U.S. in 1878, and went on to manufacture thousands of bicycles. 1890s The Mount Holly and Smithville Bicycle Railway - 1892-1898 The 1890s saw one of the biggest bicycle crazes of all, driven by several significant developments in bicycles: the invention of the \\"safety bicycle\\" with its chain-drive transmission, whose gear ratios allowed smaller wheels without a concurrent loss of speed, and the subsequent invention of the pneumatic (inflatable air- filled) bicycle tire. Experiments with chain-drive had been attempted in 1869 and 1879, but the first well known chain-drive bicycle was the \\"Rover\\" produced in 1885 by John Kemp Starley. Very quickly, the penny-farthing passed out of fashion, and multitudes of people all over the world began riding the \\"safety\\". September 13, 1892 saw the opening of a Bicycle Railroad between Mount Holly, New Jersey and the H. B. Smith Manufacturing Company in Smithville, NJ during the Mount Holly fair, with 3,000 riders its first week (for amusement instead of commuting). Coney Island wanted one, and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago featured one. Several others were built for amusement in Atlantic City, Ocean City and Gloucester City, NJ (the first two in 1893 and last in 1894). Overman Victor Flyer, a popular safety bicycle during the 1890s In the year 1896, there was simultaneously an increase in bicycle popularity and a severe economic depression. Bicycles were one of the few areas of the economy where sales were growing; people were buying bicycles \\"whether they could afford them or not\\". This attracted hundreds of manufacturers into the bicycle business. This increase in production resulted in a downward spiral of market saturation, over-supply and intense price competition. Many bicycle manufacturers, faced with excess inventory and prices too low to make a profit, went out of business. Several dozen bicycle companies consolidated into the American Bicycle Company in 1899. The application of the internal-combustion engine to the bicycle during the 1890s resulted in the motorcycle, and then soon after, the engine was applied to 4-wheel carriages resulting in the motor car or \\"automobile\\" which in later decades largely supplanted its unmotorized ancestor. 20th century Nishiki International Typical 1970s bike boom ten-speed road bike. U.S. bike boom of 1965‚Äì1975: The period of 1965‚Äì1975 saw adult cycling increase sharply in popularity ‚Äî with Time magazine calling it \\"the bicycle's biggest wave of popularity in its 154-year history\\" The period was followed by a sudden fall in sales, resulting in a large inventory of unsold bicycles. Seven million bicycles were sold in the U.S. in 1970. Of those, 5¬Ω million were children's bikes, 1.2 million were coaster brake, balloon-tired adult bicycles, and only 200,000 were lightweight 3-speed or derailleur-equipped bikes. Total bicycle sales had doubled by 1972 to 14 million ‚Äî with children's bikes remaining constant at 5¬Ω million, adult balloon-tired bicycles falling to about 1/2 million, and lightweight bicycles exploding fortyfold, to 8 million. Time magazine reported in 1971 that \\"for the first time since the 1890s, nearly one-half of all bicycle production\\" was \\"geared for adults.\\" The boom received a kick start in the mid-1960s with the advent of the Schwinn Sting-Ray and other wheelie bikes. Sales reached 4 million units per year for the first time. At the height of the boom, in 1972, 1973, and 1974, more bicycles than automobiles were sold in the U.S. Additional factors contributing to the U.S. bike boom included affordable and versatile 10-speed derailleur-geared racing bicycles becoming widely available,Bicycle Glossary by Sheldon Brown the arrival of many post-World War II baby boomers at adulthood and demanding inexpensive transportation for recreation and exercise, and increasing interest in reducing pollution. The 1973 oil crisis, which increased the cost of driving an automobile, making bicycle commuting a more attractive option, is commonly assumed to have propelled the bike boom, but in fact, bicycle sales had already peaked when the crisis struck in October, 1973. The United Kingdom experienced a mountain bike boom during the 1990s. Road bike customers were seen as reluctant to spend money, while the mountain bike market offered new features such as suspensions and materials such as carbon fibre, aluminum and titanium. The market began to implode by the time of the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. Since then it has barely recovered to the level of its prime years. 21st century As of 2008 some industry analysts see signs of surging bicycle popularity. The British press cite 2012 as a bike boom, fuelled by the successes that summer of UK cyclists in the Tour de France and at the London Olympics, Bradley Wiggins and Laura Trott in particular, and the subsequent success in the Tour by Chris Froome. In 2016, Simon Mottram of the cycling clothing brand Rapha traced the boom back to the after-effects of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, which closed parts of the Tube and encouraged many commuters onto bicycles. Two years later, the Tour de France started in London on the anniversary of the attack, and the following year Team GB dominated cycling at the Beijing Olympics. He also credits the financial incentive of the Cycle to Work scheme (introduced in 1999), and the increasing emphasis on health and congestion.\\" British Cycling, the sport's governing body, claimed that over \\"two million people across the country now cycle at least once a week, an all-time high\\". Halfords, responsible for a third of bikes sold in the UK, reported an increase of sales of 11% up to March 2015. Much attention has been given to the so-called mamils, middle-aged men in lycra, but many customers are younger men, and the most rapidly growing group is women. One of the older men, the architecture writer and cycle campaigner Peter Murray, described how business relationships are created and nurtured during longer rides; the BBC referred to cycling being \\"the new golf\\" in this sense.\\" With the development of technology, the 2010s also saw the rise of bicycle-sharing systems around the world, as well as a surge in popularity for electric bicycles, or e-bikes. 2020 saw a bike boom when the covid-19 pandemic took hold. People looked to bicycles for something to do during quarantine, exercise and as an alternative to public transportation that allows for physical distancing to minimize the risk of infection. In fact, the increase in demand and the impairment of bicycle production worldwide has led to shortages of the vehicles.

On the other side of the river was the smart beach resort known officially as Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, and unofficially as either Le Touquet or Paris-Plage. Le Touquet was in effect officers' territory, and pickets were stationed on the bridge over the Canche to enforce the separation. √âtaples was a particularly notorious base camp for those on their way to the front. The officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs) in charge of the training, the \\"canaries\\", had a reputation for not having served at the front, which created a certain amount of tension and contempt. Both raw recruits and battle-weary veterans were subjected to intensive training in gas warfare and bayonet drill, and long sessions of marching at the double across the dunes for two weeks. Initial camp disorder incident On 28 August 1916, a member of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), No.3254 Private Alexander Little, 10th Battalion, verbally abused a British Non-commissioned officer after water was cut off while he was having a shower.Kevin Baker, 2006, Mutiny, Terrorism, Riots and Murder: a history of sedition in Australia and New Zealand; Dural NSW: Rosenberg Publishing ()Anzac Heroes, 2014, Little, Alexander (1 October 2014) As he was being escorted to the punishment compound Little resisted and was assisted and released by other members of the AIF and the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). Four of these men were later identified, court-martialled, convicted of mutiny and sentenced to death, including Little. Three had their sentences commuted. While the military regulations of the AIF prevented the imposition of capital punishment on its personnel, that was not the case for the NZEF. Consequently Pte. Jack Braithwaite, an Australian serving with the NZEF's 2nd Battalion Otago Regiment, was considered to be a repeat offender, and after the death- sentence had been confirmed by the British Expeditionary Force's Commander-in- Chief, General Sir Douglas Haig, he was executed by a firing squad on 29 October 1916. His body was buried in Saint Sever Cemetery Extension in Rouen.Entry for Braithwaite's grave in Findagrave website (2019). https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/56260188/jack-braithwaite Mutiny On Sunday 9 September 1917, Gunner A. J. Healy, a New Zealander belonging to No. 27 Infantry Base Depot was placed under arrest after he and other men were observed to have deliberately bypassed the military police pickets at the bridges that gave access to Le Touquet, which was out of bounds to enlisted men. His son later recalled: :It was the practice for those who wished to visit the township to walk across the estuary or river mouth at low tide, do their thing and return accordingly. However in my father's case the tide came in, in the interval and to avoid being charged as a deserter, he returned across the bridge and was apprehended as a deserter by the \\"Red Caps\\" and placed in an adjoining cell or lock up. When news of this action reached the NZ garrison, the troops left in a mass and proceeded to the lock up. A large crowd of angry soldiers from the camp rapidly gathered near the \\"Pont des Trois Arches\\", and in a mob moved towards the town, failing to disperse, even after being told that Healy had been released. It was clear that the protest over the arrest was only the tip of an iceberg of ill-feeling and insubordination in the camp with a mob now seeking some form of confrontation out of it. The arrival of a detachment of military police upon the scene only made matters worse, and scuffles broke out between it and elements of the mob of soldiers. Suddenly the sound of shooting broke out, with Pte. H. Reeve, a military policeman, having fired at the crowd with a revolver, killing Corporal W. B. Wood, 4th Battalion Gordon Highlanders, and injuring a French civilian woman standing in the Rue de Huguet. Thereafter, the police detachment fled, in fear of a violent confrontation with the mass of soldiers. News of the shooting spread quickly; by 7:30pm over a thousand angry men were pursuing military police detachments, which withdrew away from the camp back into the town. The following morning measures were taken to prevent further outbreaks of disorder and police pickets were stationed on the bridges leading into the town. Nevertheless, at 4:00pm troops from the camp were in a state of disorder once more and had broken through the police pickets and moved into the town, where they held impromptu meetings, followed by sporadic protest demonstrations around the camp. On Tuesday 11 September 1917, fearing further outbreaks of disorder that were beyond the capability of the military police to handle, the Base Commandant requested reinforcements, as further mob protests gathered momentum. On Wednesday, 12 September 1917, in spite of a proclaimed order confining them to camp, over a thousand men broke out from its confines and marched through √âtaples. Later in the day reinforcements of four hundred officers and men from the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) arrived, armed with wooden staves along with their firearms. The HAC detachment was composed mainly of officer cadet material and was a unit on which complete reliance could be placed by the military authorities. The HAC were supported by an armed Section from the Machine Gun Corps, with several Vickers guns. The arrival of this security detachment was successful in quelling the unrest, with 300 men in revolt being subsequently arrested within √âtaples' precincts without further violence. Many of them were subsequently charged with various military offences, and Corporal Jesse Robert Short of the Northumberland Fusiliers was condemned to death on the charge of \\"Attempted Mutiny\\". He was found guilty of encouraging his men to put down their weapons and attack an officer, Captain E. F. Wilkinson of the West Yorkshire Regiment. Three other soldiers were tried by court martial and received sentences of 10 years' imprisonment. The sentences passed on the remainder involved 10 soldiers being jailed for up to a year with hard labour, another 33 men were sentenced to between seven and ninety days field punishment and others were fined or reduced in rank. Short was executed by firing squad on 4 October 1917 at Boulogne.http://www.gatesheadtimes.com/page%20shot%20at%20dawn.htm His body was buried in Boulogne Eastern Cemetery. In popular culture Poet/soldier Wilfred Owen, resting at √âtaples on his way to the line, described the context of the mutiny: :\\"I thought of the very strange look on all the faces in that camp; an incomprehensible look, which a man will never see in England; nor can it be seen in any battle but only in Etaples. It was not despair, or terror, it was more terrible than terror, for it was a blindfold look and without expression, like a dead rabbit's.\\" Siegfried Sassoon's poem \\"Base Details\\" expressed the contempt of infantry veterans for the officers and NCOs who staffed √âtaples: > If I were fierce, and bald, and short of breath, > I'd live with scarlet Majors at the Base, > And speed glum heroes up the line to death. > You‚Äôd see me with my puffy petulant face, > Guzzling and gulping in the best hotel, > Reading the Roll of Honour. 'Poor young chap,' > I'd say‚Äî'I used to know his father well; > Yes, we‚Äôve lost heavily in this last scrap.' > And when the war is done and youth stone dead, > I'd toddle safely home and die‚Äîin bed. > An Australian war-artist, Iso Rae, visited the camp during the war and depicted it in paintings. The English writer Vera Brittain served in the VAD at √âtaples at the time of the mutiny; she describes the atmosphere of rumour and secrecy in her book Testament of Youth. Female personnel \\"were shut up in our hospitals to meditate on the effect of three years of war upon the splendid morale of our noble troops\\". Meanwhile, \\"numerous drunken and dilapidated warriors from the village battle were sent to spare beds..... for slight repairs.\\" She says that it was mid-October before the mutiny ended. In a subsequent footnote she concludes that \\"the mutiny was due to repressive conditions......and was provoked by the military police\\". William Allison and John Fairley's 1978 book The Monocled Mutineer gave a very imaginative account of the life and death of Percy Toplis and of his involvement in the mutiny. It prompted questions in Parliament about the events of the mutiny when it was first published, which led to the discovery that all the records of the √âtaples Board of Enquiry had long since been destroyed. A BBC1 television series, also entitled The Monocled Mutineer, was adapted from the book, and caused some controversy at the time of its first transmission in 1986, being used by the press to attack the BBC for left-wing bias. Some advertising material issued to promote the series inadvisedly claimed that it was a \\"true- life story\\". Official records show that Toplis's regiment was en route to India during the √âtaples mutiny. No evidence exists to show that Toplis was absent from his regiment. Corporal Short's life was remembered in the song \\"Mutiny\\" by the English folk-rock band the Levellers on their album Static on the Airwaves.

He was best known as a former owner of the Milwaukee Bucks and the Golden State Warriors, both NBA teams. Early life Fitzgerald graduated from high school and attended Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio and Notre Dame in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, where he earned a bachelor's degree in naval science in 1947. He also holds honorary Ph.D.s from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater and Baldwin-Wallace College. He married Marilyn Cullen of Janesville on August 1, 1950 at Notre Dame's Old College Chapel. In 1952, he was called up for service in the Korean War as Navy paymaster on the USS Siboney (CVE-112), stationed in Norfolk, Virginia. Business career After graduating cum laude, from Notre Dame he briefly joined Standard Oil. In 1948 he began his business career with a partner, Fred Weber. They became the Shell Oil jobbers for Janesville, Wisconsin, opening their first gas station on North Parker Drive. The business grew quickly, adding gas stations and car washes. In the late 1950s, Fitzgerald began building shopping centers with his brother-in-law, J. P. Cullen. In the early 1960s, he built the first Holiday Inn in Janesville with other investors, including Cullen and the Ryan brothers, both owners of construction firms, and expanded to six other cities. The Fitzgerald group later bought into banks and cable television franchises in Janesville (Total TV, Inc.) and Madison, Wisconsin. The cable operations were eventually sold to Jones Intercable (now part of Comcast) and TCI. In the early 1980s, Total TV expanded throughout Wisconsin to include 40 cities. In 1975, Fitzgerald led a group of investors that bought Milwaukee Professional Sports and Service, Inc., the parent company of the NBA Milwaukee Bucks. Fitzgerald became chairman of the NBA's television committee. He and Bud Selig founded the pay-per-view Sportsvue cable channel in Milwaukee, which carried Bucks and Brewers games throughout Wisconsin. The network's failure after 10 months of operation was a major contributing factor in Fitzgerald's sale of the franchise. In the late 1990s, Fitzgerald was involved with SoftSpikes, a soft plastic replacement cleat for golf shoes. SoftSpikes was founded by Rob O'Loughlin, Fitzgerald's son-in-law. Fitzgerald was involved in several startup ventures, including LaserLink Golf, another O'Loughlin startup, and the manufacturer of a laser distance measuring device for golfers, run by O'Loughlin. Sports involvement Fitzgerald was chairman of the Bucks until 1985, when the team was sold to Herb Kohl. In 1986, Fitzgerald and Dan Finnane, who had also been involved with the Bucks, took over the Golden State Warriors, which they owned through 1995. At the time he owned each of these teams, Fitzgerald had only a \\"handshake agreement\\" with Don Nelson, head coach of both teams in turn, not a contract, an arrangement which reflected the friendship and trust between them. In an era of lawsuits and countersuits, this \\"contract\\" was unique in professional sports. In 1997, 50 years after Fitzgerald graduated from Notre Dame, the Fitzgerald family donated funds to build a new sports and communications center and press box at Notre Dame Stadium. Honors During the 1990s, he received several awards including being inducted to the Janesville Sports Hall of Fame, the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Wisconsin Business Hall of Fame. Personal life Fitzgerald and his wife, Marilyn, had six children. He died on June 4, 2012, aged 86, at his home in Janesville. Marilyn died on December 17, 2019.

Hales was born at Kent Town, Adelaide, the son of Frederick Greenwood Hales, a wood-turner, and his wife Sarah Leigh, n√©e Veal. He had the ordinary primary education of his time, and after being apprenticed to a carpenter began a wandering career by going to the country. For years he worked as a farm hand and rouseabout and became a magnificent rider. He occasionally contributed to country newspapers, never staying long in one place, until he came to Broken Hill, New South Wales, where he was a mining reporter for some years. There he wrote his first book, The Wanderings of a Simple Child, which was published in 1890. This went into a third edition in the following year. Hales then visited America and England and returning to Adelaide started the Adelaide Standard. He next went to the goldfields in Western Australia and started the Coolgardie Mining Review. A fire destroyed his plant and he was penniless, but after working for some time as a dry-blower he went to Boulder and with his brother Frank started the Boulder Star and later the Boulder Miner's Right. Hales stood as a labour candidate for parliament but was defeated, and when the South African war broke out became a war correspondent for the London Daily News. For a time he wrote fearlessly and critically of the way in which the British were conducting their operations, but was wounded and made a prisoner by the Boers, and was not released until the end of the war. Hales wrote a book on his experiences, Campaign Pictures of War in South Africa, (1900), and in the following year appeared his first novel, Driscoll, King of Scouts. He made a success with McGlusky, published in 1902, afterwards followed by a long series of stories with this Australian of Scottish descent as the hero. Foreign correspondents Alfred Hales and Boris L. Tageev in Ivan Tsonchev's band during the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising, 1903. Tsonchev is holdind the flag, Hales is kissing it, Tageev is under the flag Hales was not content to be merely a writer of fiction, he went to Bulgaria and fought in the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising against the Turks in 1903 in the band of general Ivan Tsonchev ‚Äì the leader of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee. This was followed by experience as a war correspondent in the Russo-Japanese War, and in the following years much lecturing in England, South Africa, Australia and South America. Wherever there was a mining field Hales visited it, and in South America he made a special study of the agricultural and pastoral possibilities of that continent. When World War I began he endeavoured to enlist but was too much over age. Hales worked as a war correspondent in France, and then went to Italy, where he met General Garibaldi and endeavoured to join the Italian army. Garibaldi, who was born in Australia, tried to help him without success, and Hales again worked as a correspondent. In 1918 he published Where Angels Fear to Tread, a series of able sketches on matters arising out of the war. After peace came Hales lived mostly in England and wrote a large number of novels, of which about 60 are listed in Miller's Australian Literature. Many of these had large circulations; of the McGlusky series of some 20 volumes about 2,000,000 copies were sold. Hales published a volume of verse, Poems and Ballads, in 1909, which is not important as poetry, and he also wrote some unpublished plays. He died in England on 29 December 1936. He was married twice; firstly to Emmeline Pritchard of Adelaide who died in 1911, and secondly in 1920 to Jean Reid. There were four sons and a daughter by the first marriage. Hales was a large man known to all as \\"Smiler\\" Hales. He took part in and was much interested in every form of sport. He was a good journalist and a good teller of tales, who believed in wholesome decent living and was not afraid to say so. His My Life of Adventure, 1918, and Broken Trails, 1931, show interesting adventures from his life.

Kouji Aiba ; From Earth, 16-year-old Kouji is brother to Yuki, childhood friend to Aoi, good friends with fellow piloting student and roommate Ikumi and an honest and good person. The main character, Kouji along with Yuki was raised by their mother after their parents divorced, and unconsciously acts as a patronizing guardian to his brother. He is an average student, ranking 26th on the piloting exams (compared to Yuki and Ikumi, who ranked first and second place respectively). Seemingly weak and spineless, Kouji is in fact very diplomatic and good at dealing with people. Yet for some reason Kouji cannot seem to get along with his own brother, Yuki, as fights, both verbal and physical seem to be inevitable whenever the brothers meet face-to-face. Outside of these domestic disputes, Kouji conducts his life with as little interaction with his brother as possible. Kouji also has an obvious attraction to Uranian aristocrat Fina S. Shinozaki, though how this relationship will proceed, and indeed if Kouji's feelings are even reciprocated, remains to be seen. With the Ryvius in turmoil, Kouji is the one who tries his best to keep the peace in a non-violent fashion, and possibly one of the very few who still retains vestiges of civilization in him. When he realized his own \\"cowardice\\"‚Äîhis wanting to satisfy everyone, which made him neglect his own feelings and values‚Äîhe finally brings his friends and the castaways back to civilization. Aoi Housen ; At 16 years of age and a childhood friend to Kouji, Aoi has known the Aiba brothers longer than anyone outside the Aiba family and acts alternately as an older sister and a mother figure to both boys, often going out of her way to check up on them. A flight attendant trainee aboard the Liebe Delta, Aoi often sticks her nose into Kouji's business. Neither Kouji nor Yuki appreciate her concerns; nor, it appears, do their respective girlfriends, Fina and Cullen. The manga adaptation of Infinite Ryvius is taken from Aoi's viewpoint, in contrast to the anime, which was mostly seen through Kouji's eyes. Outside of her dealings with the Aibas, Aoi is fast friends with her fellow flight attendant Kozue Izumi. She is also friends with classmate Reiko Ichikawa, though this relationship is not as close as the one with Kozue. All three flight attendant students roomed together on the Ryvius - although eventually Aoi is the only one left occupying that space. It is soon apparent that Aoi harbours feelings for both the Aiba brothers. However, building on her relationships with the boys was impeded by her lack of will to deal with her feelings. By the time Aoi realized what her feelings were (apparently, she prefers Kouji), Kouji was pursuing a relationship with his own crush, Fina S. Shinozaki, and Yuki's attitude made it impossible for any save the most foolish or most persistent to get close to him. By the end of the series, all relationships and emotions are resolved, and Kouji and Aoi return to the Ryvius as an official couple. Yuki Aiba ; With intelligence, strength, and intuitions superior to his brother's, 15-year-old Yuki Aiba has no need for his older brother Kouji, Kouji's friends or Kouji's patronizing - indeed, fights are inevitable whenever the Aiba boys meet face-to-face. A lone wolf, it is hard for him to live with others. Very athletic, and with outstanding piloting skills, Yuki ranks at the top of the Level 2 piloting class. Possibly the best pilot on the Ryvius after the Zwei, Yuki is one of the five main operators for the Vital Guarder, a giant mecha that acts as the primary weapon of the Ryvius. He shows himself to be the most skilled operator on a number of occasions. Aside from the above, he also has an interest in girls; he broke off with his first girlfriend, brunette Erina Rigby, aboard the Liebe Delta just prior to the station's collapse. His current girlfriend is Cullen Lucciora, a piloting classmate and fellow Vital Guarder main operator. Ikumi Oze ; At 16 years old, handsome, with good looks and a good fashion sense, the only thing Ikumi lacks is money. Although from Jupiter, an area associated with wealth and prestige, Ikumi claims to be poor and thus remained on the Liebe Delta for the Dive Break despite his friend Kouji's expectations that Ikumi would go home. Ikumi is an excellent piloting student and out of the entire Level 2 class, ranked second in the piloting exams (Kouji's brother Yuki took first place). Charismatic, Ikumi is the 'leader' of Kouji's circle of friends, and has taken notice of Kozue Izumi, his would-be girlfriend. He is Kouji's roommate, both aboard the Liebe Delta and the Ryvius, and the two are good friends. Ikumi is also the main operator for the Vital Guarder, coordinating the other four. Ikumi is the fourth and last in a successive line of captains aboard the Ryvius, following in the footsteps of such varied individuals such as Lucson Houjou, Aires Blue and - most recently - Juli Bahana. Despite his easy-going, good-humoured nature, Ikumi harboured a dark secret. During his time living a wealthy lifestyle on Jupiter, he fell in love with his own sister. As the current society forbade incest, Ikumi's sister committed suicide, and Ikumi himself relocated to the Liebe Delta soon after. Such a traumatic event in his past made Ikumi very protective of others, towards the point of insanity. This, combined with the increasing amount of violence aboard Ryvius and the brutal assault of his girlfriend, made him a coldhearted leader who cannot seem to distinguish between his allies and enemies, even going so far as to shoot his own friend. Kozue Izumi ; A 16-year-old girl from the moon, Kozue expresses her emotions easily and with clarity as she is honest about them. She wears her hair in twin side pigtails, making her seem younger than she is. In the flight attendant program, which she joined mostly because her friends were also enrolled in it, Kozue becomes good friends with Aoi, and by extension, Kouji and Ikumi. An honest girl, Kozue talks to Yuki without fear, despite his reputation. Kozue has a crush on Ikumi, and only stayed for the Dive Break because he was. She also seems to be somewhat spoiled, and often flaunts her relationship with Ikumi. Over time Kozue's spoiled behaviour led to several jealous girls, tired of Kozue's selfishness, to attack her. The result of this incident led to Ikumi Oze becoming unhinged. A secondary result was that Kozue requested to leave the dormitory she shared with Aoi and Reiko in favour of a private officer's room, a request that in the circumstances could hardly be refused. She spent most of the remainder of the Ryvius's voyage in that room, unwilling to leave or contact anyone except for Ikumi. Also, she wore her hair down for the last few episodes following her assault, as a testament to the childhood she lost and her newfound maturity; this also makes her resemble Ikumi's sister more. She seems supportive of Ikumi until the very end of the Ryvius's 1st voyage. She is also present on the second voyage, when she reconciles with Aoi, and her relationship with Ikumi is left open. Cullen Lucciora ; Note: This character is referred to in some material as Karen Luchiora. In a space school where girls tend to go into flight attendant classes while the boys become pilots and mechanics, 16-year- old Cullen is against the norm as one of the few female Level 2 piloting students aboard the Liebe Delta seen in the Ryvius. While quite capable, coming in fifth place on the piloting exams, Cullen can also be fickle and enjoys acting on her own rather than with a group of people. Seen as a background character in the initial episodes (she was the girl who returned Ikumi's music card to him in the premier), she eventually comes into prominence later on. When she sees something she wants, she often goes to great lengths to get it - be it a music card or a boyfriend. Cullen plays by her own rules, and only does what she wants, wandering around alone quite often. Her number one interest is music, and she is always in search of songs she likes. She sometimes chooses to sleep in a tent inside the ship rather than in the residential area, although this may be to listen to her music in peace and without crewmates asking she turn down the volume. Cullen is one of the five main operators of the Vital Guarder, and the current girlfriend of fellow lone-wolf and VG pilot Yuki Aiba. Fina S. Shinozaki ; Note: This character is referred to in some material as Faina S. Shinozaki. Having been born and raised on Uranus, where the harsh environment of the planet gave rise to a special form of religion, Fina has a unique sense of ethics based on the followings of her sect's founder, Mother Arne. At 16, Fina is extremely beautiful, but due to her aloof mannerisms stemming from her beliefs and her standing in the Uranian aristocracy, she is hard to approach. Rescued by Kouji Aiba and Ikumi Oze during the collapse of the Liebe Delta, Kouji was attracted to her at first sight, though Fina's unique sense of ethics may keep the two from getting closer. She has a pet ferret, Rafra, who becomes the unofficial mascot for the Ryvius. Fina's creed is \\"cut off the past with your own hands\\", which she sometimes takes too literally. Despite her initial appearance of being normal (and somewhat privileged), it is revealed Fina has a dark and disturbing secret. Not only does her beauty, charisma and demure mannerisms hide an unstable madness, but following her personal creed as mentioned above, Fina is also guilty of murder. She followed an extreme interpretation of her religious beliefs, stating that in order to cut off the past she had to literally cut it off. This unfortunately involved Fina killing with her bare hands anyone that reminded her of the past, including her former boyfriend McBain, and her friend Sandy Aren, who was strangled and her body disposed of under the cover of the celebrations of the Ryvius's party in episodes 10-11. A motive given for her first murder suggests her religious interpretation was a coping mechanism evolved after the fact. However, as Fina found out from Kouji and later Neya, the past will always linger. This and the fact she overhears Kouji declaring that their relationship is over, likely drove Fina into a complete mental breakdown - as if her actions in episode 25 were not indication enough, Fina does not return with the others to the Ryvius in the next episode. In the last episode Kouji, given the honour of deciding the Ryvius' new first destination, chooses to visit the Uranus vicinity because he has some things he wishes to discuss with her. Neya ; Note: This character is referred to in some material as Neeya. A strange person in an equally bizarre outfit, she murmurs the thoughts and words of others as if not understanding what they mean. She initially appeared before Kouji during the collapse of the Liebe Delta. As the series progresses and she gains strength, Neya encounters others aboard the Ryvius. Most notable of these is Nicks, who develops a sort of attraction to the eye-catching pink-clad young woman - he certainly doesn't forget her appearance. Hard to miss, Neya is often seen wandering through the halls or outside the ship unprotected. The latter is impossible, as anyone going out must wear a spacesuit or suffer a gruesome death. A notable exception to this rule is when the field is up: fairly early in the series, during repairs on the ship, a member was seen on the ship's hull without any garment but a towel. Furthering the rumours of a ghost, Neya was once perceived walking straight through solid walls by unsuspecting students. It was revealed that she is the biological core for the Ryvius (one of a series of sentient ships using creatures called Vaia). Although not human, she based her form on the body of a deceased young woman drifting outside in space by the Ryvius. That young woman was the daughter of Conrad Vicuss, the man in charge of hunting down the Ryvius. When Neya herself appears before Conrad in one of the last episodes, it is understandable that he should be shocked to see his own daughter acting as defender and guardian over the Ryvius. It is through Neya's intervention and assistance that those aboard the Ryvius survived their ordeal, and she continues to act in her capacity as the ship's Sphix - an alien defending the Ryvius and her young crew. Team Blue is the moniker for a martial arts group from Saturn featured in the sci-fi anime series Infinite Ryvius. The group functions almost like a street gang aboard the Ryvius, and uses violence to seize power and attempt to bring people under their control. For a time, they were the de facto leaders of the Ryvius, and after their fall some members regained power in successive regimes aboard the ship. The gang gets their name from Airs Blue (see below). = Airs Blue = ; Appearing much older than he really is, Airs Blue (age 15) is the leader of Team Blue, and at one point, Captain of the Ryvius. Skilled in martial arts himself, Blue intentionally puts himself in danger so as to feel alive. He was suppressing his violent side when on the Liebe Delta, but the Ryvius is a whole new environment and Blue sees the opportunity to unleash his natural aggression and take over the ship. The fact he owns the only firearm on the Ryvius, a needle-shooting pistol stolen from one of the saboteurs of the Liebe Delta, assists his coup significantly. He was also the brain behind the Ryvius's hated points system, which had all but the five Vital Guarder operators, Zwei, non-Zwei bridge crew and the Team Blue members earning points for food and essentials. The exceptions were those listed above, as they received unlimited points, and this unfair treatment was one of the reasons the crew revolted against Blue's regime and his gang. His entire gang captured, only Blue managed to escape by going into hiding in the bowels of the Ryvius. Blue's reign comes to an abrupt end thanks to Stein, who transmits part of a conversation throughout the entire Ryvius in the hopes that the others will get rid of Blue, who Stein sees as nothing but a barbarian and not good enough to be on the bridge at all, much less captain. In a fit of anger, Ikumi accuses Blue of plotting to take the Vital Guarder and abandon the Ryvius. As with Juli, Blue simply says, \\"What'll you do if I am?\\" It is not known if he was serious, or if he was saying it as an assertion of power, or purely as a hypothetical situation. He's later discovered by Kouji, who helps him by smuggling food to Blue's hiding place. Although initially suspicious of Kouji's motives, Blue has no choice but to trust him and even ends up giving Kouji his gun, claiming that, \\"I'm kinda interested to see how you'll use it.\\" It's interesting that despite their hatred of the points system, both his successors (Juli and Ikumi) decided to keep it going, even keeping unlimited points to the chosen few. His father is the Minister of Defence on Saturn, although nothing is known about his mother. At one point, Juli accuses Blue of planning to hand over the Ryvius to his father in exchange for safety (Blue doesn't confirm or deny this, saying simply and rather ambiguously, \\"What if I am?\\"). The implication that Blue's father wouldn't be willing to help his son or any of the others unless there was something in it for him indicates that the two aren't all that close (in fact, Blue's only comment upon hearing of the destruction of Hyperion and his father's death is, \\"What a way to go.\\") Blue appears to have an interest in Juli Bahana. While he seemed to find her views naive, he seemed fascinated with her feelings and emotions regardless. During the party, it is implied that Blue entered Juli in the beauty contest anonymously as he also ordered her to go to the party and gave her a dress to wear. His feelings for Juli are confirmed by Neya who speaks his thoughts aloud in which Blue mentions his desire for revenge and his hatred for his family is gone only to be replaced by thoughts of Juli Bahana. It is not known if Blue and Juli become an official couple; although both return to the Ryvius, they do so separately (Blue's presence is only confirmed by a shot of Yuki clutching his bandanna and laughing triumphantly, having obviously won the long-awaited rematch between them). Juli, on the other hand, is seen to be wearing a ring on her wedding finger, but it has never revealed whether or not it is actually an engagement or wedding ring or, for that matter, that it was Blue who gave it to her. = Fuu Nam Chai = ; A distant relative of Blue's, he is also from Saturn. At 16, Fuu is Blue's right-hand man and is in charge of executing Team Blue operations. Although very intelligent, this skilled fighter is hot- tempered and at times can be very ditzy. Along with the rest of Team Blue except for Blue himself, Fuu ended up in the Ryvius's brig when their coup was ironically overthrown in a revolt by the rest of the ship's crew. He was the one in the white tuxedo who acted as Master of Ceremonies during the Ryvius's party. = Criff Cay = The seductress of Team Blue, 15-year-old is good looking and knows it. The older, taller, and red-haired Kei girl, she came with her sister Michelle to Liebe Delta for nursing training. Criff is always in provocative outfits flirting, and she seduced information out of Charlie after beatings were found to be much less effective. When Team Blue fell from power, Charlie rushed to her aid despite her treatment of him, and after a brawl both were thrown into the same cell in the brig. Criff warmed to Charlie during their stay together, and when Michelle offered her a chance to escape with her, she ended up remaining with Charlie, and the two went into hiding. = Michelle Cay = A year younger than her older sister, looks nothing like Criff but has a slightly wild appeal of her own. Short, both of stature and of her green hair, Michelle laughs a great deal, often chews pink bubble gum, and seems airheaded. However, this is a front for her more dangerous abilities, and given the chance could prove even more dangerous than Airs Blue. She is one for holding grudges, and anyone who had happened to annoy her to that point have since paid a heavy price. Like her sister, Michelle is adept at seduction, and used her skills to obtain a new wardrobe and the freedom of her fellow Team Blue members from the brig. Unfortunately she was raped by several boys after being captured during the uprising. Although she falls for Stein's trickery and, along with the others on the Ryvius, becomes convinced Blue was going to betray them and is furious with him because of it, Michelle still retains a certain dependency on Airs Blue. This can be seen on the penultimate episode; when the soldiers have boarded the Ryvius and are firing at them, and Michelle starts screaming for Blue to help her. Zwei is the designation given to an elite class of second-year students aboard the Liebe Delta space station in the futuristic sci-fi anime series Infinite Ryvius - they are quite literally space cadets. Composed of 12 students, this class was given responsibility to steer the Liebe Delta into the Geduld as part of the station's regular system maintenance. This maneuver (called the Dive) was considered so routine it was entrusted to the Zwei, under supervision from their instructors. The Dive was sabotaged, and was ultimately a failure, with the instructors all dead and the Zwei, as the most advanced students in the Liebe Delta, forced to take control of the station and later, the Ryvius. Despite their elite status and being considered second only to the instructors, many of the Zwei are not that skilled. Their longer training gives them an edge on their shipmates, but they are still students too - a fact the resentful crew of the Ryvius often seem to forget. Zwei is the German word for two, signifying the group as the next or second generation of humanity's leaders. The German pronunciation for the word is , and original Japanese dub uses a Japanese approximation, . The American English dub uses an Anglicized pronunciation of . =Juli Bahana= ; A scholarship student, 16-year-old Juli is the top-ranking student and recognised leader of the Zwei. During Lucson's stint as \\"captain\\", she was the actual de facto exerciser of that role, and after the fall of Team Blue, was appointed the role by majority vote. Her parents are presumed to have died at an early age, as she grew up in an orphanage and thus tends to solve problems by herself. Calm and kind, with an inner fortitude, Juli lacks the charisma of a leader. She is very beautiful, and those around her (especially her mostly-male classmates) see it as a shame she lacks a sense of her own femininity. She helped take care of Pat when the Ryvius initially started up, and he looks up to her as a surrogate sister and mother. Juli realizes she had fallen in love with Airs Blue immediately after the end of his reign and wishes to see him again after he escapes and hides himself. At one point after her reign of the Ryvius, Juli is seen in her room wearing the dress Blue gave her while thinking about him. At the end of the anime, Juli returns to the Ryvius and is wearing an engagement ring. Although Blue also returns to the Ryvius, it is unclear whether he gave her the ring. =Lucson Houjou= ; Loud, blustering and generally ineffective, 17-year-old Lucson is the self-proclaimed captain of the Ryvius and leader of the Zwei (titles recognised only by Lucson, as the rest of the crew have other people in those positions). In the Zwei for training for entry to the National Defense Academy, Lucson has his family honor and pride to live up to; his father and three brothers are already in the service. This pompous boy's complete lack of leadership skills is obvious to everyone, that is, except Lucson himself. After a stint as the captain of the Ryvius, Lucson was demoted to ship's janitor and Pat's caretaker. Yet despite these indignities, he still has his pride. He's essentially good- hearted, and takes a beating towards the end of the series in an attempt to protect Pat. =Stein Heigar= ; Cool-headed and very smart, 17-year-old Heigar is studying general information technology in preparation for entry into the National Defense Academy. His father is a civil officer in the Defense Forces. As the second-ranked student in the Zwei after Juli, Heigar acts as an assistant and lieutenant to the leader and captain of the ship, whoever he or she may be (in other words, loyalty to the office and not its holder). His aloofness, combined with an ever-present poker face, has others believing he is emotionless. Cold, calculating and ambitious, Heigar somehow often has no problem persuading others to accept his decisions or grant him power. His desire for an utopian society on the Ryvius led to an increasingly harsh regime, to the point where he was willing to turn in even fellow Zwei cadets as so-called 'threats' to the order and control of the ship. =Charlie (Good Turtleland III)= , also known as ; Joining the Zwei at his parents' request, this chubby boy of 16 years is timid and sheepish despite his great name. He hops between the elite Zwei and the street gang Team Blue, whose members gave him the nickname 'Charlie'. He fell head over heels for Team Blue seductress Criff Kei, not realizing until much too late that she was only leading him on. During the coup that overthrew Team Blue, Charlie could have stayed safe as a member of the Zwei. Unwilling to forsake the girl he (still) loved, Charlie went out to Criff's defense and took the beating meant for her. This selfless act thawed out Criff's cold heart, and she became considerably warmer to him, even choosing to stay by his side when Michelle offered her a chance at freedom. The last episode seems them as a couple and Charlie is unrecognizable initially as he had lost weight. =Carabona Guinea= ; The second of three female Zwei cadets, she is the mousy-haired, slightly square girl who also appears to be the Ryvius' communications officer. She does the announcements from the bridge whenever Kouji and Fina are absent, and is a roommate of Juli, Pat and Ran. She seems to have a flair with designing and making clothes, as she made a number of outfits for the various students on the Ryvius to wear for the ship's party, and also created Ran's cheongsam dress. Ginny was rather put out that Ran didn't want to go to the party and wear the dress, until Ran abruptly changed her mind. Ginny also started going out with fellow Zwei cadet Chic Kraat after he asked her to should they survive what turned out to be the last of the Ryvius' many battles. =Ran Luckmolde= ; Cold and cynical, it is hard to tell who is more frigid‚ÄîHeigar or Ran. This 17-year-old girl is the third and last female member of the mostly-boys Zwei class. Ran develops some kind of attraction for Pat Campbell, even though he is half her age and prefers Ginny and Juli's more open company to Ran's. This attraction becomes apparent as the series goes on despite Ran's attempts to hide it. Indeed, it was insinuated by Heigar that Ran's emotions concerning Pat bordered on shota-con. Ran slapped Heigar by means of reply, and Heigar retaliated by demoting Ran from her elite Zwei status to a failing E student and had her thrown out of the bridge. =Pat Campbell= ; Although not a member of the Zwei per se, Pat is seen as such as he was brought into Juli's care. He came to the Liebe Delta to visit his father while the ship was diving. When the space station collapsed, Mr. Campbell perished attempting to save the lives of all the students aboard, and Pat went through the terrible experience of losing a parent. Handsome and with a bright future, Pat makes the best sandwiches and always wears his teddy bear backpack. The youngest child aboard the Liebe Delta at its collapse, at 8 years old Pat is also the youngest child on the Ryvius. In the end he seems to have transferred his dependency from Juli to Ran, holding an item given to him from Ran before she left. =Brian Brabb, Jr.= ; Brian is one of the older Zwei and a selfish, timeserving young man. When Team Blue was in control of the ship, he began a relationship with Michelle Kei, but disposed of her as soon as Blue lost power. He also is a vocal proponent of the point system, or whatever else gets him his way. Later, he is shot for opposing Ikumi's harsh rule on the Ryvius. =Kevin Green= ; The overweight member of the Zwei with short black hair and glasses. After disposing of Charlie, flirting with Eins and Brian, and attempting to seduce Stein, Criff dotes on Kevin. However, he rejects her when Blue's plan to abandon the Ryvius is revealed. =Eins Crawford= ; At 15, Eins is one of the youngest Zwei, along with Chic Kraat. Criff briefly flirts with him after dumping Charlie. =Chic Kraat= ; Initially, Chic seems to be bossy and cold. However, towards the end of the series, he expresses his feelings for Carabona. =Kreis Morate= ; Quiet and a bit nerdy, Kreis is the programming genius of the Zwei and designed many of the Solid programs. He helps Heigar initiate the rebellion against Team Blue. =Gran McDaniel= ; Gran is ambitious and prefers not to work with his fellow Zwei. He tries to convince Son Doppo, a member of Team Blue to help him escape from the ship while abandoning the other students in the process. However, he and Son are caught, beaten by the other male members of Team Blue and put into jail cells on the ship. Reiko Ichikawa ; This plain-faced flight attendant trainee was roommates with Aoi, Kozue, and (briefly) Fina. Timid by nature, Reiko proves to be selfish and cowardly in a hostile situation, when Kozue was ganged up on and attacked by several other girls for being the girlfriend of an \\"unlimited points user\\". Reiko, feeling unable to help and stunned by the fact that battles between women were even more ugly than men's, ignored Kozue's cries for help and fled. She was the last to move out of the dorm used by the four girls, the first being Fina, who in following her religious beliefs left in favour of a private officer's room, and the second being Kozue, whose injury had her hiding in another officer's room unable and unwilling to contact anyone. Before moving out of the dorm, she was scared to death by a raging Ikumi, who had gone and trashed the dorm and even threatening to kill her, pouring shampoo on her head and grabbing hold of it. She later joins Fina's \\"religious group\\" in hope that the past can be forgotten. When the Ryvius is under siege by Ikumi, she fears that he will come after her and kill her. Nicks Chaiplapat ; A hyperactive boy from Deimos, a moon of Mars, 13-year-old Nicks is a Level 2 Flight Class student. He was the boy who made it a point of rubbing in Ikumi's failure to retrieve a piece of debris in the first episode. When first exploring the Ryvius, Nicks discovered what became the Vital Guarder system and is one of its sub- pilots/operators. Nicks likes racing utility robots and slacking off, and on the Ryvius is the roommate of Kouji and Ikumi. Nicks also likes pretty girls, as evidenced when he used binoculars for up-close looks at the contestants in the Miss Ryvius beauty contest. Akihiro Miyabi ; A plump boy from Mars, Akihiro is meticulous and withdrawn. He and Nicks are childhood friends, and although at 16 he is older than Nicks by three years, Akihiro gets treated as a little brother by the overactive Nicks. Preferring on the whole to work in the background and do his best, Akihiro often has to keep Nicks from slacking and/or going out-and-out nuts. In addition with Nicks, Akihiro is also one of the VG's many sub-pilots and operators. He believes that Kouji is like Akihiro himself, a weak-willed person who would rather stay on the sidelines and let others do what they will. Kouji, however, proved Akihiro's assumption wrong, and Akihiro resolved to be a stronger person, a decision he told Kouji of in a letter Akihiro sent to Kouji during the last episode. Kibure Kikki ; Kikki constantly wears a dinosaur-like mascot-style costume and serves as a background character. She appears in passing or in crowds scenes at least once every episode, and many fans of the series have made a point of searching for her in the episode they are viewing. Aside from this, she usually a loner, but appears with a fellow costumer in Episode 11. Possibly the only exception to this is Cullen, whom Kikki accidentally clonked on the head with the headpiece of one of her other costumes when the gravity control on the ship failed. They were seen talking together in a few subsequent episodes, but this was likely just a casual acquaintance as Cullen did not appear to have anything to do with Kikki after the former became a Vital Guarder operator. Johnson Cole ; A 16-year-old boy, Johnny appears to be the clumsy nerd character of the show. He first appears in the third episode when, thinking that everyone was going to die, confessed his feelings for (), a fellow girl classmate in front of everyone, only to be embarrassed when she shot him down (although she did it gently). He then, to her annoyance, becomes her self-proclaimed stalker and is seen in many episodes trying to make advances on her. So much so that he even went as far as to try and capture her with a pair of clamps when the Ryvius's gravity went offline after the Vital Guarder first separated from the Ryvious in order to \\"secure\\" her safety. He was thwarted when the girl's best friend head butted him in the chest. Later on, at the end of the series he risks his life to save the girl earning her affection and admiration. They are seen together as an official couple when returning to the Ryvius. Radan ; Typically known as Pillow Boy, he is named in episode 11 as being Radan. He has become one of the funniest running gag characters on the show. He is always seen with nothing but a pillow covering his privates. Apparently having lost all his clothing when the Lebria Delta was destroyed in the sabotaged dive. He never once seems to have asked anyone for some extra pants and is constantly seen naked. Even scaring Kikki when she wondered onto him once. Like Kikki he is seen at least once every episode and many people have made it a game trying to spot him. Emerson Elby and Lilith Frau Emerson Elby („Ç®„Éû„Éº„ÇΩ„É≥„Éª„Ç®„É´„Éì„Ç£) and Lilith Frau („É™„É™„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•„Éª„Éï„É©„Ç•) are probably the only normal couple on board the Ryvius. First seen in episode three when the two sneak into a storage closet to make out, only to be \\"rudely interrupted\\" when the Zwei order everyone to evacuate when the Libra Delta begins to sink. They are seen a few more times in the show and they are always together. Despite this however as the series progresses, particularly after the points system is added, their relationship starts to degrade, with Emerson constantly trying to take his girlfriend's points in an attempt to bet on races that he keeps losing. By the end of the series he does not return to the ship because of fear, but Lilith does.

APSA acts as the Treasury and central bank of Vatican City and the Holy See. Both before and after the reorganization of its functions in 2014, APSA has been distinct from the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See.  Assets  The assets entrusted to the administration (previously in the care of what was its Extraordinary Section) were initially 750 million Italian lire (at that time equivalent to 8,152,000 pounds sterling) in cash and 1000 million Italian lire (at that time equivalent to 10,869,000 pounds sterling) in Italian State bonds, an amount less than Italy would have paid under the Law of Guarantees of 1871, if the Holy See had accepted this. A 2012 report from the Council of Europe identified the value of a section of the Vatican's property assets as an amount in excess of ‚Ç¨680m (¬£570m); as of January 2013, a papal official in Rome named Paolo Mennini manages this portion of the Holy See's assets‚Äîconsisting of British investments, other European holdings and a currency trading arm. The Guardian described Mennini as \\"in effect the pope's merchant banker [who] heads a special unit inside the Vatican called the extraordinary division of APSA ‚Äì Amministrazione del Patrimonio della Sede Apostolica ‚Äì which handles the so-called 'patrimony of the Holy See'.\\" History Pope Paul VI established APSA as part of his broader reform of the Roman Curia in the apostolic constitution Regimini Ecclesiae universae issued on 15 August 1967. The text is available in Italian and Latin. It is the latest in a series of bodies first established in 1878 and subject to periodic modifications in name and remit. APSA was composed originally of two sections: *The Ordinary Section continued the work of the Administration of the Property of the Holy See, a commission that Pope Leo XIII set up in 1880, initially as an advisory body, and to which in 1891 he gave direct responsibility for administering the property remaining to the Holy See after the complete loss of the Papal States in 1870. *The Extraordinary Section administers the funds given by the Italian government to implement the Financial Convention attached to the Lateran Treaty of 1929. Before the establishment of the APSA, these latter funds were managed by the Special Administration of the Holy See.Annuario Pontificio 2012 (), p. 1847. The same text is given on the website of the Holy See After World War II, the International Monetary Fund recognized the Administration of the Property of the Holy See, as the central bank of Vatican City.Pollard, 2005, p. 200. On 9 July 2014, the Ordinary Section of APSA was transferred to the Secretariat for the Economy. Only the Extraordinary Section remained within the purview of APSA. Since then APSA focuses exclusively on its role as a Treasury for the Holy See and the Vatican City State. Although Pope John Paul II's apostolic constitution Pastor Bonus specified that APSA is headed by a prelate with the rank of cardinal, Chapter II, Article 173. the custom of giving the president of APSA the temporary title of \\"Pro-President\\" in anticipation of his becoming a cardinal has falling into disuse; Pope John Paul and his successors have all given the title of President to prelates who were not yet cardinals.

It connects M-35 near Gwinn with the Marquette Bypass, an expressway carrying US Highway 41 (US 41) and M-28 in Marquette. M-553 connects Marquette with Sawyer International Airport at the unincorporated community of K.I. Sawyer AFB, the former site of a US Air Force base, in the Sands Plains area of Marquette County. The intersection with County Road 480 (CR 480) in Sands Township, known locally as the Crossroads, is the site of several businesses. North of this location, M-553 runs through some hilly terrain around a local ski hill. The trunkline was originally County Road 553 (CR 553) in Marquette County. CR 553 dates back to the 1930s, was fully paved in the 1940s, and a segment of the roadway was relocated in the 1950s. During the early 1990s, the City of Marquette extended one of their streets, McClellan Avenue, southward to connect to CR 553\\\\. The county road was transferred from the Marquette County Road Commission (MCRC) to the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) on October 1, 1998. MDOT assigned most of the former county road the M-553 designation after the transfer was complete. One section that was less than a mile (about 1.4 km) was given the M-554 designation. This related trunkline was unsigned by the state with only city street signs to indicate its existence. In 2005, control of various roadways was exchanged between the City of Marquette and MDOT, and M-553 was extended through the city. At the same time, M-554 was turned over to the city's jurisdiction. Route description alt=Photograph of M-553 begins as a two-lane rural highway east of Gwinn at an intersection with M-35 in the community of New Swanzy. From there it runs north through some commercial properties into the Sands Plains, a sandy area sparsely covered with Jack Pines. The highway runs through an intersection with M-94 near the west gate of the former K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base. In this area, the trunkline is parallel to a line of the Canadian National Railway which connects mines of the Marquette Iron Range to Escanaba. M-553 crosses over the rail line west of the runway at the Sawyer International Airport located at the former Air Force base. On the north side of the airport, M-553 intersects Kelly Johnson Memorial Drive, the airport access road named for Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson, who was a noted aviation engineer at Lockheed who helped design the SR-71 \\"Blackbird\\" reconnaissance aircraft and member of the International Aerospace Hall of Fame. The trunkline continues farther through woodlands and turns to the northwest. M-553 passes the Marquette County Fairgrounds and reaches CR 480 at the Crossroads area just north of the Sands Plains and the Blueberry Ridge ski trail; the area around the intersection has several businesses. alt=Photograph of North of the intersection, M-553 passes some residential subdivisions in the northern end of Sands Township. As the highway continues northward, the landscape transitions into hilly, wooded terrain. The trunkline descends through a series of curves, first to the northwest and then a steep downhill curve, known locally as Glass' Corrner, northeasterly alongside the Marquette Mountain ski area. The highway enters the city of Marquette and runs past the front of the ski resort's chalet before crossing the Carp River. North of the river, the roadway ascends part of the west side of Mount Mesnard before leveling off near the intersection with Division Street. Past that intersection, M-553 follows McClellan Avenue as a four-lane boulevard divided by a center turn lane through a residential area on the south side of the city. The trunkline passes between the Superior Hills Elementary School to the east and the Marquette Golf and Country Club to the west. There is a pedestrian bridge over the roadway adjacent to the school, and north of the overpass the center turn lane ends. With few exceptions, the adjacent properties in this area do not have direct access to the highway. M-553 descends one last hill and terminates at a Michigan left intersection with the US 41/M-28 expressway; McClellan Avenue continues north of the terminus through a business district to a residential area. alt=Photograph showing a Like other state trunkline highways, M-553 is maintained by MDOT. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that, on average, 3,615 vehicles between the M-35 and M-94 junctions, and 10,021 vehicles north of Division Street, used the highway daily. No section of M-553 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History =County road era= The first roadway along the route of the modern M-553 was a county road; it was first shown on maps by 1936. At the time, the northern half of this county road was \\"improved\\", meaning it was gravel or stone, while the southern half was an earthen road. The southern end started in downtown Gwinn at the time. The northern half was paved during World War II; a new road was paved immediately east of Gwinn, shifting the road out of town. The remainder of CR 553 was paved by the middle of 1946. At the time, CR 553 ran north from New Swanzy along what is now Marshall Drive to the county airport; the roadway continued north of the airport along the present course except through the Sands area, where it ran to the east, and ended at a terminus on the south side of Marquette at Pioneer Road and Division Street. In 1953, the county road commission relocated CR 553 near the county airport to eliminate a rail crossing and a pair of tight turns. The county entered into negotiations with the US Air Force to lease the county airport for use as an Air Force Base in 1954; a lease was signed on January 24, 1955, and the base was active the next year. In the mid-1960s, the rail line and roadway in the area were moved to go around a section of the runway complex's cargo ramps; this relocation also added a new rail line crossing to CR 553. In 1975, residents of a trailer park on Pioneer Road and city officials asked the county road commission to reconfigure the intersection between the county road, Division Street and Pioneer Road to reduce accidents. alt=Photograph In 1976, the MCRC shifted the southern end of CR 553 westward to its current alignment from K.I. Sawyer AFB to New Swanzy so the road crossed the railroad in a different location, using a bridge instead of the previous at-grade crossing. Later in the decade, another section of the roadway was realigned through Sands Township; this segment was moved by 1979 south of the Crossroads area. The southern end of this project was completed by 1981, and the roadway directly angled northwesterly instead of utilizing a long sweeping curve between the road to the south and the new road to the north. Later in 1986, the roadway carrying CR 553 over the Carp River was washed away during spring flooding; the county had to replace the culverts supporting the road with new ones, forcing a temporary road closure. The bridge over the rail line near the Air Force Base had weakened sufficiently by December 1988 that the MCRC had to lower the truck weight limits for the structure from for single-unit trucks and for double- or triple-unit trucks; repairs to the structure were planned for the following year. The City of Marquette started planning an extension of McClellan Avenue southward to CR 553 in the 1970s. When the projects were started in the 1990s, the goal was to reroute traffic and relieve congestion in town. By April 1994, the street had been extended south from the retail corridor along the business loop north of the Marquette Bypass to the Superior Hills Elementary School. Funding at that time was in place for the extension only as far as Pioneer Road. The last segment between Pioneer Road and CR 553 was held up over environmental clearances and funding; there were some wetlands in the path of the proposed construction. The US Congress initially denied funding for the extension in 1993, but they approved funding for this section of the McClellan Avenue project later in 1994 while the environmental assessments were being reviewed. In 1995, a passing lane was approved to run uphill southbound approaching Glass' Corner in a project funded by the federal government based on MDOT recommendations. The city and county continued to improve CR 553 and McClellan Avenue during 1996. The county closed the road between the Carp River and the Crossroads starting in June 1996. During the closure, they built the previously approved passing lane for southbound traffic headed uphill near Marquette Mountain; the project was completed on November 1, 1996. By the end of that month, the city had the necessary environmental approvals and cleared the land needed for the last southward extension of McClellan Avenue; construction crews were working on blasting rock, drainage and other earthworks for the project. alt=Aerial photo of Local business owners near the intersection between McClellan Avenue and the Marquette Bypass petitioned the city and MDOT in November 1996 to reconfigure the intersection, calling it \\"confusing\\", \\"dangerous\\" and \\"inconvenient\\". The intersection was configured as a Michigan left design when McClellan Avenue was extended southward past the expressway in 1994. Transportation planners defended the design, saying the intersection was actually safer than several others in the city, even if its unique status made it unfamiliar to local drivers. Michigan left intersections are common in the Lower Peninsula, but this intersection was the first in the UP built that way. In 1993, the federal government announced plans to close K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base in 1995. The after effects of the base closure were the impetus for a December 1996 study by UP counties on the designation of a north‚Äìsouth highway corridor in the region to help fuel redevelopment at the base; the study would help MDOT and the counties prioritize transportation funding. When the local study group completed its report in June 1997, CR 553 was included with M-35 and US 41 as part of the primary north‚Äìsouth traffic corridor in the Central Upper Peninsula. The group cited the redevelopment efforts at the former air force base for the designation. The McClellan Avenue extension was finished the following September, and CR 553 was realigned to flow into the south end of McClellan. Instead of curving to the northeast in the area, the county road turned northward and a T-shaped intersection was built to reconnect CR 553 with the remainder of its routing into South Marquette, requiring the county road to make a right-angle turn. =State trunkline period= alt=Photograph of the As part of Governor John Engler's \\"Build Michigan II\\" plan in the late 1990s, about of roadway were investigated as potential candidates for state maintenance as part of the Rationalization plan. Included in these queries were county roads 553, 460 and 462; the latter two roadways connected east‚Äìwest across the former base. Traffic to and from the base was increasing as a byproduct of economic redevelopment at K.I. Sawyer, and if the state took control of the roadways, they would be marked on the state map like other state trunklines, further benefiting redevelopment. Local officials were concerned at the time because at least one proposal included a total of of roads, one-third of the county's primary county road network. The MCRC manager was concerned that such a transfer could impact the level of funding the commission received for the maintenance of the roads that would remain under county jurisdiction. The three county roads were transferred to state jurisdiction on October 1, 1998. MDOT renumbered the two roads across K.I. Sawyer as an extension of M-94, and designated M-553 along most of CR 553\\\\. The latter highway designation then terminated at the southern end of McClellan Avenue in the city of Marquette; the remainder of CR 553 to the intersection with Pioneer Road and Division Street was given the M-554 moniker by the state. The city and local residents expressed safety issues concerning pedestrians at Marquette Mountain in 2000, and driveways access was consolidated by MDOT in a construction project while a specific pedestrian crossing was installed by the ski hill owner. The Carp River flooded on April 16, 2002, washing out the roadway where M-553 crossed the river. The washout sent \\"tons of sediment\\" into the river, impacting the fish habitat before the Central Lake Superior Watershed Partnership could assist MDOT to stabilize the banks. Before the event, the highway had crossed the water body using two , oval metal culverts. The flood waters overwhelmed these culverts and washed away a section of roadway. MDOT budgeted $750,000 (equivalent to $ in ) that May to rebuild the river crossing using a concrete bridge instead. alt=Previous rectangular marker In April 2005, the City of Marquette initially agreed to exchange jurisdiction over a number of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed former Business US 41 (Bus. US 41) and M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. One of the city's requests in negotiating the transfer was to have MDOT defer to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway access and snowmobile access. The transfers were made official on October 11, 2005, and signage was updated on November 9. Because of the transfer, MDOT initiated a speed study to determine what speed limits should apply on the extension. The McClellan Avenue section of M-553 was placed under a temporary traffic control order leaving the limit in place. A school zone was considered near the Superior Hills Elementary school. In 2009, the speed limit along McClellan Avenue was raised to . The school zone was implemented in December 2011, reducing the speed limit to for two 40-minute periods during the morning and afternoon. The reduced speed limit is indicated by a set of flashing lights installed in December 2011. MDOT started construction of a new 20-space commuter parking lot at the southern terminus of M-553 at M-35 on August 11, 2008, as part of an effort to offer expanded ride-sharing opportunities in Marquette County. Another carpool lot was added at the Crossroads when MDOT partnered with the restaurant there. The state paved the gravel parking lot, and the business allowed the installation of signs. Future alt=Photograph In 2012, MDOT identified a section of M-553 known as Glass' Corner as one of the more dangerous stretches of highway in the state. Short sight distances and the end of a southbound uphill passing lane immediately before the curve have resulted in serious accidents. In the short term, the department announced additional signage to warn motorists approaching this section. An audit also recommended the installation of street lighting by Sands Township. Another intermediate-term proposal is to reduce the speed limit from , an action that would require the involvement of the Michigan State Police. MDOT is seeking funding for a project to straighten some of the curves and decrease the roadway's grade. Work was expected to cost $5 million and be completed by 2017 at the time. No progress at funding the Glass' Corner project has been made, and it is not listed in MDOT's 2016‚Äì2021 five-year transportation plan nor the draft for the 2017‚Äì2022 plan. Major intersections Related trunkline M-554 was a short state trunkline highway in the city of Marquette that follows what is now a part of Division Street. The southern terminus was at the intersection with M-553 and McClellan Avenue. From there, the highway ran just under a mile (1.4 km) within Marquette in a tree-lined section of the city that is relatively flat; the roadway that carried the M-554 designation has a few gentle curves. At the intersection with Pioneer Road and Division Street, the M-554 designation ended, and the roadway continued as Division Street. The only signage present along the route to indicate the highway number was the street signs erected by the City of Marquette Department of Public Works; MDOT never posted the standard reassurance markers along the road, leaving M-554 as an unsigned highway, although at least one map manufacturer included the highway on its maps. When CR 553 was transferred from the county to the state on October 1, 1998, one segment was not included in the routing for M-553; that section between the McClellan Avenue and Pioneer Road intersections was numbered M-554 by MDOT. The City of Marquette approved a plan to accept jurisdiction of M-554 from MDOT in April 2005; the plan also affected two other roads (Bus. US 41 and M-553). On October 10, 2005, the city and the state exchanged jurisdiction of the three roadways in Marquette. The signage was changed on November 9, 2005, reflecting the changeover of M-554 and Bus. US 41 to the city's control and McClellan Avenue to the state's control. This change ended the existence of M-554. Since the transfer, the former M-554 is now part of an extended Division Street. ;Major intersections See also * Notes References External links * *M-553 at Michigan Highways *Former M-554 at Michigan Highwayss *Rationalization at Michigan Highways 553 Category:Transportation in Marquette County, Michigan ","title":"M-553 (Michigan highway)"},{"id":"6604800","text":"The Symphony No. 33 in B major, K. 319, was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and dated on 9 July 1779.

The battle was waged to complete the recapture of the central portions south of the archipelago and secure them from remaining Japanese forces. Background Within two weeks of ordering the seizure of Palawan and the Zamboanga peninsula, General Douglas MacArthur directed the capture of the isolated Visayan islands of Panay, Negros, Cebu and Bohol in the central Philippines. With Filipino guerrillas controlling most of the countryside in these islands, some thirty thousand Japanese troops held the vital coastal towns including Cebu City on Cebu island and Iloilo City on Panay, among the largest cities in the Philippines. Aside from fulfilling his desire and promise to clear the Japanese from the islands, Gen. MacArthur wanted these two port cities as vital staging points for the expected large numbers of troops scheduled for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. Earlier, the United States Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff had told him to be prepared to stage twenty-two divisions for the mainland operation at bases across the Philippines by November 1945, with another eleven to follow by February 1946. Battle =Operation VICTOR I= Two areas of operations were suggested to divide the entire region, given the mountainous terrain of Negros, a dominant terrain feature that ran north to south of the island, and the planners chose to seize the western portion, including Northwestern Negros and Panay island, which was named VICTOR I. Lt. Gen. Robert L. Eichelberger, the Eighth Army commander, appointed the 40th Infantry Division, a California National Guard formation and veterans of the recent fighting in Luzon under Maj. Gen. Rapp Brush, with the 503rd Parachute Regimental Combat Team in reserve. Panay Island was the first objective. On 18 March 1945, within two weeks of aerial bombardment on Japanese positions, the 40th Infantry Division, spearheaded by the 185th Infantry Regiment landed unopposed at Tigbauan district, several miles south of Iloilo City, where a 23,000 strong guerrilla force had secured most of Panay, under Col. Macario Peralta. Recalled Gen. Eichelberger: \\"Filipino guerrillas stood stiff, resplendent in starched khaki uniforms and ornaments and decked in battle gear\\". The regiment proceeded to seize the airfield at Barrio Tiring, Cabatuan, Iloilo. The Iloilo International Airport is currently located on the same area in Cabatuan, Iloilo. The regiment also proceeded to seize the airfield at Mandurriao district. The Japanese were holed up in Iloilo City, and the 40th Division easily swept these Japanese outposts in two days. Mopping up operations by the guerrillas and 2nd Battalion of the 160th Infantry Regiment continued, and at war's end, some 1,500 Japanese troops surrendered. Guimaras and Inampulagan islands, between Panay and Negros, were seized on the same day Iloilo fell, 20 March and the next day, respectively with no opposition. =Seizure of Negros= On 29 March, a reinforced platoon from Company F, 185th Infantry under 1st Lt. Aaron H. Hanson slipped ashore ahead of the main landings to be staged near Bacolod, seized the 650-foot steel truss Bago River bridge, which separated Pandan Point from the city itself, a vital link in supporting movement of heavy weapons and equipment. The Japanese guards were surprised, and the bridge was secured for several hours before reinforcements arrived. U.S. artillery in action on Negros island, April 1945 The sudden seizure of the Bago river bridge easily allowed the 185th Infantry Regiment to land at Pulupandan unopposed, then they advanced rapidly, seizing seven more bridges in turn, and finally captured Bacolod the next day 30 March, mostly because the Japanese did not contest the beach landings; with the use of artillery, they could have inflicted numerous casualties. The 40th Division pushed farther inland and toward Talisay, where Japanese forces tried to disrupt its advance with delaying actions, but the Americans simply overwhelmed these, and on 2 April, the coastal plain of Negros was in Allied hands. On 9 April, all three regiments of the 40th Division pushed east into the rugged, mountainous interior of the island. The Japanese resisted stubbornly, aided by booby- trapped terrain, defended their fortified positions by day, and conducted harassing attacks at night. Soon, the 40th Division started using small infiltrating units to creep past tank traps and minefields, then scrambled uphill across open fields of fire to attack Japanese positions. On 23 May, at Hacienda San Jose, San Carlos, Medal of Honor awardee, Staff Sgt. John C. Sjogren of Company I, 160th Infantry, led one such attack on a ridgetop entrenchment, and despite being wounded by gunfire, had accounted for some forty-three Japanese casualties, destroyed nine pillboxes, as he cleared the way for his comrades to follow. Sjorgen's unit, Company I, subsequently received a Presidential Unit Citation for its heroic action. By 4 June, the Japanese began a general withdrawal, retreating further into the unexplored mountains of Negros. Eight weeks later, the 40th Division overcame these final defenses and scattered the rest of the Japanese into the jungle. =Operation VICTOR II= About a week into the Panay and northwestern Negros operations, Operation VICTOR II, the seizure of Cebu, Bohol, and southeastern Negros, was underway. The Americal Division under Maj. Gen. William Howard Arnold was tasked by Gen. Eichelberger for the operation. Some 14,500 Japanese troops held Cebu, but 2,000 Japanese soldiers under Maj. Gen. Takeo Manjome were contained in northern Cebu by about 8,500 guerrillas under Lt. Col. James M. Cushing. One-third of the Japanese forces in Cebu were combat-ready, with an extensive network of formidable defensive positions around the city. Cebu City residents greet U.S. troops On 26 March 1945, at 08:28 on Talisay Beach, four miles (6.5 km) west of Cebu City, the 182nd Infantry and 132nd Infantry landed on the west and east, respectively, after an hour-long naval bombardment. Japanese resistance was light, but Japanese mines destroyed ten of the first fifteen landing tracked vehicles that moved ashore, effectively stopping the advance. Subsequent landing waves stacked up behind the first that created a large traffic jam, but the Japanese did not exploit this easy target. Some two hours later, the traffic lessened as troops cautiously picked their way through the dense minefield, and pontoons were later used to circumvent the mine barriers. The next day, 27 March, the Americal Division moved into already devastated Cebu City, as the Americans began a rapid advance. On 28 March, Lahug airfield, two miles northeast of Cebu was seized, as Arnold's troops began to confront two heavily defended Japanese positions in the outpost line, capturing one on the same day. The 182nd Infantry continued its attack the following day, then the Japanese detonated an ammunition dump on the second hill, with one 182nd company sustaining fifty killed or wounded in the explosion. In the succeeding days, savage resistance continued in the Japanese lines around the city, and as the Americal Division grimly assaulted individual positions with tank-infantry teams and with crucial fire support from offshore Seventh Fleet destroyers, the Japanese slowly gave ground. On 13 April, previously with a plan to envelop the Japanese right flank, Gen. Arnold secretly sent his returning regiment, the 164th Infantry, into night marches twenty-five miles (40 km) to the west, well behind the Japanese lines, and with all three regiments, the 182nd and 132nd in front and the 164th from the rear attacking simultaneously, the Japanese were forced to withdraw. With the continued presence of air and artillery fire, Gen. Manjome realized that his entire force would surely be annihilated, and he ordered a retreat into the mountainous northern reaches of Cebu on 16 April. Pursuit operations began on 20 April, and together with Cushing's guerrillas, killed any Japanese who turned to fight. Some 8,500 Japanese troops remained holed up in northern Cebu until the end of the war. =Capture of Bohol and Southeastern Negros= Japanese weapons collected, 1945 On 11 April 1945, well before the fighting in Cebu subsided, the Americal Division went to action elsewhere, as Bohol island and southeastern Negros became the next targets, when a battalion of the 164th Infantry landed on Tagbilaran City on Bohol's western coast. With the assistance of local guerrilla forces led by Major Ingeniero, the battalion pushed inland, located the defenders and cleared the island of Japanese resistance by the end of the month, at a cost of seven men killed. On 26 April, remnants of the 164th went ashore at Sibulan, some five miles (8 km) north of Dumaguete, rendezvoused with a Reconnaissance Troop of the 40th Division, and in two days, attacked the 1,300 strong Japanese force entrenched in forbidding hill positions surrounding Dumaguete. Major combat operations continued until 28 May 1945, when the Japanese positions fell and Filipino guerrillas assumed responsibility for mopping up operations. The 164th Infantry suffered thirty five men killed and 180 wounded in southeastern Negros, while the Japanese lost 350 men and fifteen were captured. Aftermath Overall, the Visayas operations of the U.S. Eighth Army suffered relatively light casualties in comparison to Japanese figures. The 40th Division in Panay and northeastern Negros suffered 390 killed and 1,025 wounded with the Japanese sustaining 4,080 killed with another 3,300 succumbed to disease and starvation. The American Division at Cebu and Bohol suffered 417 killed and 1,700 wounded, with Japan sustaining 5,750 killed and 500 wounded. Though some Japanese units had survived deep in the mountains, Gen. Eichelberger's units had clearly liberated the entire Visayas. Gen. MacArthur was particularly pleased with his subordinate's fast-moving and decisive operations against the slow, methodical fighting of the Sixth Army in Luzon. On 21 April 1945, he termed Eichelberger's Visayas operations on the congratulatory cable were a \\"model of what a light but aggressive campaign can accomplish in rapid exploitation.\\" See also *Military History of the Philippines during World War II *Military history of the United States *Military history of Japan *History of the Philippines *List of American guerrillas in the Philippines Notes References * The Fighting Fortieth in War and Peace (Hardcover) by James D.

The aim of the Act was to liberalise and deregulate the British broadcasting industry by promoting competition; ITV, in particular, had earlier been described by Margaret Thatcher as \\"the last bastion of restrictive practices\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22120480 The act came about after the finding from the Peacock Committee. It led directly to the abolition of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and its replacement with the Independent Television Commission and Radio Authority (both themselves now replaced by Ofcom), which were given the remit of regulating with a \\"lighter touch\\" and did not have such strong powers as the IBA; some referred to this as \\"deregulation\\". The ITC also began regulating non-terrestrial channels, whereas the IBA had only regulated ITV, Channel 4 and British Satellite Broadcasting; the ITC thus took over the responsibilities of the Cable Authority which had regulated the early non-terrestrial channels, which were only available to a very small audience in the 1980s. Effects of the Act An effect of this Act was that, in the letter of the law, the television or radio companies rather than the regulator became the broadcasters, as had been the case in the early (1955‚Äì1964) era of the Independent Television Authority when it had fewer regulatory powers than it would later assume. =In television= In television, the Act allowed for the creation of a fifth analogue terrestrial television channel in the UK, which turned out to be Channel 5, and the growth of multichannel satellite television. It also stipulated that the BBC, which had previously produced the vast majority of its television programming in-house, was now obliged to source at least 25% of its output from independent production companies. The act has sometimes been described, both as praise and as criticism, as a key enabling force for Rupert Murdoch's ambitions in Britain. It reformed the system of awarding ITV franchises, which proved controversial when Thames Television was replaced by Carlton Television, for what some felt were political reasons (see Death on the Rock), and when TV-am, admired by Mrs Thatcher for its management's defiance of the trade unions, lost its franchise to GMTV (the now-former Prime Minister personally apologised to the senior TV-am executive Bruce Gyngell). It also allowed companies holding ITV franchises to merge with each other starting in 1994, beginning the process which eventually led to all franchises in England and Wales coming under the control of ITV plc in 2004. =In radio= In radio, it allowed for the launch of three Independent National Radio stations, two of them on medium wave using frequencies formerly used by the BBC, and the other on FM using frequencies formerly used by the emergency services. It set out plans for many more local and regional commercial radio stations, generally using parts of the FM band not previously used for broadcasting, which have since come to fruition. Its plans for expanding community radio were only really developed in the 2000s. Controversy The Act passed through Parliament despite opposition from much of the Labour Party and from some members of the ruling Conservative Party, who saw it as representative of a decline in standards, and on occasions saw it as enabling what was, for them, an unwelcome Americanisation. Notably, Douglas Hurd has since criticised the Act's after-effects, describing it as \\"one of the less successful reforms of those years\\". These Conservatives would have described their position as paternalistic as a term of praise, while supporters of the Act would use it against them as a term of abuse. During Tony Blair's tenure as leader, the Labour Party's broadcasting policy generally shifted much more towards that expounded in the Act. The then Home Secretary, David Waddington, described the Act as heralding \\"a massive expansion in choice\\", and supporters of the multichannel age in British broadcasting have praised the Act, and later regulation influenced by it, for such reasons. Supporters of the previous, more regulated system have strongly criticised the Act, and some have blamed it for what they see as a \\"dumbing down\\" of British television and radio. Like many other reforms of the Thatcher years, it has a tendency to polarise opinion very strongly. One initially less-obvious effect of the Act was that technical standards ceased to be monitored and enforced by the regulatory body along with the programme content.

Hegarty is well known for her non-fiction novels that document her personal history as one of the Stolen Generation. Her first book, Is That You Ruthie?, is based on her experiences in the Cherbourg Aboriginal Mission where she lived until the age of 14. Her second novel, Bittersweet journey is her story from her early married life, her dealings with the Native Affairs Department, and her work in community politics and Indigenous organisations. Is That You Ruthie? won the 1998 Queensland Premier's Literary Awards, Unpublished Indigenous Writer - The David Unaipon Award. In 2010, Hegarty was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards. Life Hegarty and her mother, Ruby, were initially housed together in the dormitories at the Cherbourg Aboriginal Mission. When Hegarty was 4 years old they were separated, when Ruby was sent away to work. They only had intermittent contact from that time onwards. At the settlement Hegarty formed strong friendships with the other girls in the dormitories. They were constantly supervised, punished and whipped for minor misdemeanours. The girls in the dormatory stayed together for support and for protection. There was no natural justice, just strict discipline and punishment. She states: > We got whipped from babyhood - there was no age, you just got it. And this > is what we got whipped with [cat o'nine tails]. It was used in the prison at > the time, and they were using it on us as children. It isn't any different > from a prison - it is exactly like it, except that we weren't inmates; we > were children, and we'd done nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong at all. In 1943, Hegarty was sent away from the Cherbourg settlement to work as a domestic servant. Travelling to her new job, at the age of 14, she travelled alone for the first time in her life. She did not know the people she was travelling to work for and she felt very isolated and vulnerable. In the 1960s after accessing her records from Cherbourg, when she found that many of the letters she had written to her friends at the mission had not been delivered, Hegerty organised a reunion of the girls she grew up with at Cherbourg. Ruth married Joe Hegarty, whom she had known since childhood, and has a family of eight children. For more than 30 years Hegarty has volunteered on community projects in the areas of youth and aged services. In 1998 she was awarded the Premier's Award for Queensland Seniors Year for her services to the community. She is a founding member of Koobara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Family Resource Centre. In the 2007 Senate enquiry in Stolen Wages Hegerty was a member of the Queensland Stolen Wages Working Group. Bibliography *Is That You Ruthie? (UQP, 1999; 2003) ReviewReview *Bittersweet journey.

The two stations broadcasting on AM were allocated frequencies previously used by BBC Radio 3 (to be used by INR2) and BBC Radio 1 (to be used by INR3). Background The stations came about following the Broadcasting Act 1990 which allowed for the launch of independent national radio (INR) stations in the United Kingdom. The Radio Authority was mandated to award three INR licences. The FM licence (INR1) had to be for a 'non-pop' station and one (INR3) had to be for a predominantly speech-based service. The remaining licence (INR2) was to be open to 'all-comers'. The licences were to be awarded to the highest cash bidder, providing that the applicant met criteria set down in the Broadcasting Act. INR stations on air *Classic FM - 99.9 to 101.9 MHz, first air date 7 September 1992, owned by Global Radio. *Absolute Radio - 1215 kHz mediumwave in most areas, first air date 30 April 1993 as Virgin 1215, owned by Bauer Radio. *Talksport - 1053 kHz and 1089 kHz in most areas, first air date 14 February 1995 as Talk Radio UK, owned by Wireless Group. All three stations are also available nationally on DAB on the Digital One multiplex as well as on digital TV and online. Plans for a fourth station, using 225kHz long wave, were mooted in 1996 but were abandoned by the Radio Authority after consultation with the radio industry which found that there was no interest in launching a station on that frequency due to the costs involved, especially to cover all of the country given that the frequency would only provide partial-UK coverage. The frequency had originally been allocated to the BBC but it had never been used.

It came into existence on 1 December 1984 and took on its functions with effect from 1 January 1985. Its responsibilities were taken over by the new Independent Television Commission on 1 January 1991. The Authority consisted of a board of members appointed by the Home Secretary under the chairmanship of Richard Burton, former chairman of Gillette UK, and an executive staff headed by Jon Davey as Director General. The Authority had two main functions. The first was the grant of licences, following a competitive franchising procedure, for the provision of services over a new broadband cable system in a specified geographical area. Franchises were to be exclusive, and were granted after examination of the applicants' financial capacity and their plans, according to a series of criteria laid down in the Act of Parliament. By the end of the Authority's life, 136 cable franchises had been awarded, embracing about 15 million homes of the 22 million in the UK. The second main function was the regulation of the programme services carried by cable systems. To this end the Authority was required to draw up codes on programme standards (covering taste and decency, accuracy and impartiality of news, etc.), advertising practice and sponsorship, and then monitor programme services to ensure that the rules were kept. Although this was achieved through the licences granted to cable operators, they were usually just the local distributors of national broadcasts, and the Authority's dealings were in practice with those who provided the programme channels. So, for example, Sky Television publicly cited the Cable Authority as its regulator, even though no formal relationship existed between them. The Authority submitted annual reports to the Home Secretary, which were laid before Parliament and published.

The bridge measures long and carries four lanes of British Columbia Highway 11. The bridge is the only fixed road crossing between Maple Ridge and Agassiz. History Before the Mission Bridge was completed, the only link between the City of Abbotsford and the City of Mission was the CPR's Mission Railway Bridge which had wooden planks laid on the ties between the rails, and outside the rails, to allow the passage of automobile traffic. Due to floods in the 1940s and 1950s, the bridge and surrounding area were becoming inaccessible. This was causing damage to Mission's business centre because a large percentage of the revenue in Mission came from Abbotsford. In order to revitalize business, a more permanent solution was needed. The Mission Bridge project was put into action in May, 1969, with the dredging of the Fraser River's banks. The construction of the bridge was a large undertaking. Construction of the main span occurred between May 1969 and 1972. It included 19 piers, a four-lane highway and pedestrian/bicycle routes adjacent to the main roadway. The total cost of the project was approximately $13,000,000 (CAD). The Bridge was officially opened on July 11, 1973 by the Premier of British Columbia of the time, Dave Barrett. Seismic retrofitting Between 2012 and 2013, the bridge was seismically retrofitted, which included the strengthening of the bridge structure, the installation of a new seismic restraint system, installation of new deck joints, and painting of various components. New cycling railings and cycle approaches valued at $1.5 million were also completed as part of the superstructure improvements.

Early life Jack Edwards was born in Cardiff, Wales on 24 May 1918, in the suburb of Canton, joining the Territorial Army just before the outbreak of the Second World War. British Army career Edwards was an army sergeant in the Royal Corps of Signals when Singapore fell to the Japanese in February 1942. He was interned for some time by the Japanese in the notorious Changi jail before transported to Taiwan, then the Japanese colony of Formosa. Edwards was put into the Kinkaseki POW camp, a mountainous region near Jiufen, where he and 525 see also Appendix B for a named list of inmates. other inmates were forced to work the copper mine daily in tropical heat. To get to the mine, parties had to walk up 250 steps to top of a ridge, then down 831 more to sea, and then descend a further 800 steps inside the mine to the working face on the lowest levels.Edwards & Walter, 1994, pages 60‚Äì62 So ever day before, and then again after work, the men had to walk up and down 1,881 crudely cut steps (by way of comparison there are 1,665 steps to the small platform on the top of the Eiffel Tower).. His team was required to bring out 24 bogeys of copper every single day, if not, they were then beaten. As men died, or were transferred to other camps because they were too weak and ill to continue working, replacement contingents were drafted in to make up the numbers. From the initial contingent of 525 only 120 remained in Kinkaseki when the camp was abandoned between 16 and 30 May 1945. for the number; for the dates. Edwards was moved to a remote jungle camp called Kukutsu in the Taihoku Heights about from Shinten. He was in the first party to arrive on the 1 June 1945. Their first task was to construct the camp as the site was a derelict tea plantation with no facilities. All materials for the construction were carried by the prisoners who were forced to carry each. On the 28 August 1945 the USAAF started to drop food supplies on the camp and on the afternoon of 5 September American Marines arrived at the jungle camp. He and others were so emaciated that their eyes were sunken and their bodies mere skeletons of their former selves. photographs 10 and 11 After World War II Edwards spent a year recuperating in Britain, then in 1946 he returned to Asia to help in the apprehension of Japanese war criminals and to give evidence at their trials as part of the war crimes investigation team in Hong Kong. While visiting Kinkaseki he found Document No. 2701 ‚Äî the only surviving copy of the Japanese order to massacre all prisoners of war if the Allies landed on the Japanese home islands ‚Äî and an important piece of evidence at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. On his return to South Wales Edwards worked in local government. There, he felt an active discouragement from talking about the horrors he experienced as a POW. Unable to settle, he left for Hong Kong in 1963. Edwards took up a post as a housing officer in the housing department of the Hong Kong administration, later becoming a senior housing manager for Hongkong Land. There, he was actively involved in the Hong Kong Ex-Servicemen's Association as well as the Royal British Legion, becoming later on its chairman. He was also president of the St David's Society of Hong Kong. Life as a campaigner In 1989, after the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, Edwards started to help the Hong Kong people with British Dependent Territories Citizenship (BDTC), to fight for the recognition as British Citizens with the right of abode in the United Kingdom from the British Government. He was featured in the open forum \\"Hong Kong - A Matter of Honour\\" which organized by RTHK in Hong Kong and the BBC in Britain, during which showed a Union Jack flag which was hoisted in Hong Kong during 1945, and defended the contributions from the British Army and local veterans in the program. Through his efforts as the chairman of the Royal British Legion (Hong Kong and China branch), in 1991 Edwards succeeded in winning monthly pension awards from the British government to ethnic Chinese veterans and their widows. A greater triumph came in 1996 when Edwards fought and won the granting of British citizenship to wives and widows of those veterans. He spoke out for the many in Hong Kong who during the occupation, had been forced to sell their businesses as well as property to the Japanese in exchange for the worthless Japanese military yen. Personal life Edwards's first marriage ended because of the war. In 1990, he married Polly Tam So-lan, a former member of a Chinese People's Liberation Army dance troupe whom he met in 1974. They lived in a flat in Sha Tin in the New Territories. Both he and Polly loved dancing by practising to the tunes of Taiwanese songs in their small living-room. Edwards spoke fluent Cantonese. He was survived by his wife and her daughter by her first marriage. Trivia *It took him 45 years to write his book Banzai You Bastards!. *The first translator of his book, the Japanese journalist Shinji Nagino, was murdered in Montreal with two-thirds of the way to go. *After being requested by Diana, Princess of Wales to find the grave of Major-General Merton Beckwith-Smith, the father of Princess Diana's lady-in-waiting who had died as a POW in Japan, Edwards managed to locate it. *In 1981 the National Film Board of Canada released A War Story: Based on the Diaries of Dr. Ben Wheeler, docudrama produced, written, and directed by Anne Wheeler whose father was the Canadian doctor in the Kinkasekihe camp. Jack Edwards was a featured commentator in the film, along with several other former POWs who were interviewed in the documentary. *In 2000, a memorial was erected in Kinkaseki to which Edwards returned for the second time with the help of a grant of ¬£10,000 from the British Government. *Edwards and his other POW survivors escaped impending death at the hands of their Japanese captors by a mere two days due to the dropping of the two American atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. *When American aircraft began to drop supplies into Edwards' POW camp near the end of the war, several POWs and civilians were killed by the supplies which were dropped too low for their parachutes to work. Edwards was the only one to know flag semaphore in the camp as he had learned it in the Boys' Brigade. As Edwards frantically signalled \\"Don't Drop\\" the American aircraft circling overhead was about to drop supplies on top of him until the crew realised Edwards' signals. There was only one crew member on the aircraft who could read semaphore and he had learned it in the Boy Scouts of America.

It is a relatively common rockfish of the Pacific coast. It is very widespread in its distribution, known from the very northern reaches of the Gulf of Alaska, to the Pacific side of the Baja California peninsula, north of Guerrero Negro. The copper rockfish is also very widely distributed in depth, from the subtidal shallows of about . Copper rockfish are known to be highly variable in coloration, ranging from a dark reddish brown, with pale copper blotching along the sides, to a lighter pinkish brown with a yellowish white mottling on the flanks. At one time it was thought that these variations were two different fish: Sebastes caurinus and Sebastes vexillaris. It is now known however that it is simply one species. Males are known to mature between three and seven years, while females mature between four and eight years. Generally the larger a female is, the more young she will bear. Copper Rockfish are a viviparous fish giving birth to live young after a gestation period of around 10 months. They are a long-lived fish reaching ages of over forty years old with the oldest known individual being 55 years old. Copper Rockfish are a modest fish reaching a maximum size of TL and a weight of . Juveniles are almost exclusively found in kelp beds and shallow rocky areas. They begin life feeding primarily on planktonic crustaceans. As they grow they continue to feed on increasingly larger crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs as well as squid and octopus. Smaller fish also make up a large part of their diet. In turn copper rockfish are preyed on by lingcod and cabezone and even salmon. Sea birds and sea mammals also take their toll, and also man. Copper Rockfish are known for the table quality of their flesh and their willingness as a sportfish. The adult copper rockfish is found very close to the bottom often touching. They are almost always associated in and around rocks, and almost never on sand. This rockfish is known to be very faithful to its chosen home and numerous tagging studies have shown that these rockfish travel no more than a mile from their chosen location.

Career  Robert E. Vardeman was born in Mineral Wells, Texas, but is a longtime resident of Albuquerque, New Mexico. He graduated from the University of New Mexico with a B.S. in physics and a M.S. in materials science. He worked for Sandia National Laboratories in the Solid State Physics Research Department before becoming a full-time writer. He got his start in writing by writing for science fiction fanzines, and was nominated for the 1972 Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer. Vardeman is one of the founders of Bubonicon, a science fiction convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico. = Pseudonyms = The first volume in Vardeman's Keys to Paradise fantasy series was credited to the pseudonym \\"Daniel Moran\\", the publisher possibly being unaware of author Daniel Keys Moran, but the second book in that series then stated that Vardeman was \\"writing as Daniel Moran.\\" Vardeman started publishing two other series under pseudonyms in the late 1980s ‚Äì the fantasy series After the Spell Wars under the name F.J. Hale, and the Star Frontier science fiction series under the name of Edward S. Hudson. Both of these series were partially republished under Vardeman's own name. He also wrote Gateway to Doom (1983) from Tom Swift III, and The Microbots (1992) and Mutant Beach (1992), part of the Tom Swift IV series of books under the house pen name, Victor Appleton; as well as writing numerous westerns under the pen names Karl Lassiter and Jackson Lowry. He also wrote in the mid-1970s for Book Creations, Inc., under house pseudonym Paul Kenyon for The Baroness series, but the book was canceled before publication. Similar work includes eight novels written for the Nick Carter adventure series, the novel Sea Fire under the name Cliff Garnett, more than 100 novels written for a major western series, plus eight novels written for another western series that was less enduring.  Works  He is the author of more than fifty fantasy and science fiction novels.

He was also a central figure in the development of ecological psychology. Barker earned his PhD from Stanford University where his advisor was Walter Richard Miles. In the 1940s Barker and his associate Herbert Wright from the University of Kansas in Lawrence set up the Midwest Psychological Field Station in the nearby town of Oskaloosa, Kansas, a town of fewer than 2000 people. Barker's team gathered empirical data in Oskaloosa from 1947 through 1972, consistently disguising the town as 'Midwest, Kansas' for publications like One Boy's Day (1952) and Midwest and Its Children (1955). Based on this data, Barker first developed the concept of the behavior setting to help explain the interplay between the individual and the immediate environment. Possibly one of the most valuable developments of Barker's work was the examination of the way in which the number and variety of behavior settings remains remarkably constant even as institutions increased in size. This was explored in his seminal work with Paul Gump published as Barker, R. and Gump, P. (1964) Big School Small School, Stanford: Stanford University Press. They showed that large schools had a similar number of behavior settings to small schools. A consequence of this was that students could take many different roles in small schools (e.g. be in the school band and the school football team), while in larger schools there was a greater tendency to be selective. Barker died at his home in Oskaloosa, Kansas in September 1990.

Mackay graduated from the University of Sydney in 1904 and taught physics there from 1910 until 1914, when he joined the Australian Imperial Force shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. He served with the 4th Infantry Battalion at Gallipoli, where he distinguished himself in hand-to-hand fighting at the Battle of Lone Pine. In April 1916, he assumed command of the 4th Infantry Battalion on the Western Front and led it at the Battle of Pozi√®res, Battle of Bullecourt and Battle of Broodseinde. He was promoted to brigadier general in June 1918, and led the 1st Infantry Brigade at the Battle of Hazebrouck, the Battle of Amiens and in the attack on the Hindenburg Line. After the war, Mackay studied physics at the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford before returning to Australia and his old job as a lecturer at the University of Sydney. From 1933 to 1940 he was headmaster of Cranbrook School, Sydney. He remained in the Militia between the wars, and was a major general by the time the Second World War broke out. He was selected to command the 6th Division in 1940, and led it through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. Any doubts about his ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to the Western Desert Campaign. During the Battle of Bardia in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire. He was recalled to Australia in 1941 to serve as General Officer Commanding Home Forces. On 6 April 1942, he assumed command of the Second Army. During 1943 he twice commanded New Guinea Force in the fighting in the New Guinea campaign. His active service ended with his appointment as High Commissioner to India in November 1943. Early life and career Iven Giffard MackayThe G in Giffard is soft, as in \\"general\\". was born in Grafton, New South Wales, on 7 April 1882. The eldest of three children, he was the only son of the Reverend Isaac Mackay, a Presbyterian minister from Armadale, Sutherland, Scotland, and his Canadian wife Emily Frances, n√©e King. Iven was educated at Grafton Superior Public School, Newington College, and the University of Sydney, where he opened the batting for the university's cricket team, and won Blues for rugby union football and rowing. He graduated with his Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1904. Mackay had served in the Newington College cadet unit, reaching the rank of sergeant and winning a trophy in 1899 for being the school's best rifle shot. In 1911, he became a lieutenant in the Cadet Corps. On 20 March 1913, he transferred to the Militia as a lieutenant. In July he became the adjutant of the 26th Infantry Battalion, which was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Henry MacLaurin. As part of his training, he attended the School of Musketry in Randwick, New South Wales. He was promoted to captain on 1 June 1914. Mackay joined Sydney Church of England Grammar School in 1905, teaching various subjects and coaching the rowing and rugby teams. In 1910 he returned to the University of Sydney to teach physics. From 1913 to 1914, he studied for a Diploma of Military Science course at the University of Sydney. First World War Mackay joined the Australian Imperial Force on 27 August 1914 as adjutant of the 4th Infantry Battalion, with the rank of captain. On 4 September 1914, he married his fianc√©e, Marjorie Eveline Meredith, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel John Meredith, in a ceremony at St Philip's Church, Sydney. The couple had met while Mackay was on holiday in Paterson, New South Wales, in 1910. In October 1914, Mackay suffered a riding accident and was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with a punctured lung and broken ribs. The injury forced him to miss the scheduled embarkation of his battalion. He sailed for Egypt with the 1st Reinforcements of the 13th Infantry Battalion, departing Sydney on the transport on 19 December 1914, arriving at Alexandria on 31 January 1915. He was then posted back to the 4th Infantry Battalion as the Transport Officer. He observed the landing at Gallipoli from the transport SS Lake Michigan, but did not go ashore with the battalion, as his job was to take care of the horses. He re-joined the battalion on shore on 8 May 1915. Heavy casualties in the early fighting had depleted the officer ranks and Mackay was promoted to major on 14 July 1915, and given command of a company in August. =Gallipoli= On 6 August 1915, Mackay was involved in the Battle of Lone Pine. When the attack began, Mackay went over the top at the head of an attack. He ignored the first Turkish trench, taking a direct line to his objective. Firing from the hip, he shot and killed several Turks in the trenches below. Mackay positioned himself at the junction of two trenches, shooting down more enemy troops. When no others appeared, he came to the belief that the trenches were in Australian hands and ran across the junction into a wide bay. The first man who attempted to follow was shot dead, as were the next two after him. The rest decided not to follow. Mackay took up a position on a fire step, a raised part of the trench floor which allows men to fire over the top. Three Turkish soldiers appeared in the trench. Mackay attempted to fire but his magazine was empty. He lunged at the Turks, grazing one and making all three run. Mackay then instructed his party to fortify the position with sandbags. As the barricade was built up, it became possible for the rest of the party to join Mackay. The post became the north eastern corner of the new Australian position at Lone Pine. It was in an exposed position and came under hand grenade attack from Turkish troops. Mackay was slightly injured in one such attack. When Lieutenant Jack Massie was sent to relieve Mackay during the night, Mackay refused to leave the post. By the next day, Mackay realised that the position could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied with the security of the new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches. (Mentioned in Despatches ‚Äì Gallipoli) =Western Front= Mackay sailed for France on 20 March 1916 on the transport Minnewaska as part of the Advance Party of the 1st Division. On 18 April 1916, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the 4th Infantry Battalion. He led it at the Battle of Pozi√®res in July, where it was involved in the capture of the town. Here, a famous incident occurred: : For his part in the battle, Mackay was mentioned in despatches a second time. (Mentioned in Despatches ‚Äì Western Front) He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his gallantry at Lone Pine, his part in the capture of Pozi√®res, and his role in repelling a German counterattack at Mouquet Farm, near Pozi√®res. (Distinguished Service Order) alt=Two officers stand on the steps of a French Chateau. Mackay held the temporary position of commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade in January 1917, for the first of what would be five times totalling 92 days in 1917. He commanded the 4th Infantry Battalion in the advance to the Hindenburg Line, including the capture of the fortified town of Hermies. During the German counter-attack at Lagnicourt in April 1917 his battalion held its positions, repulsing the Germans with heavy casualties. Acting brigade commander again during the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May, Mackay was mentioned in despatches for the third time, (Mentioned in Despatches ‚Äì Bullecourt) and awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: : Along with Brigadier General H. Gordon Bennett and others, Mackay received personal congratulations from Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig. He later received his medals from King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Mackay led his battalion once more at the Battle of Broodseinde, earning a fourth mention in despatches. (Mentioned in Despatches ‚Äì Broodseinde) In March 1918, the four machine gun companies in each division were grouped into machine gun battalions. Mackay was given command of the 1st Machine Gun Battalion, the 1st Division's new battalion, which he led in the Battle of Hazebrouck. He was given the brevet rank of major in the 26th Infantry Battalion in the AMF back home on 3 June 1918. On 6 June 1918, Mackay was heading on leave to London to visit his wife, who had managed to reach England after a long battle with wartime travel restrictions, when he was stopped and turned back at Boulogne by British military police. He had been appointed to command the 1st Infantry Brigade and had to return at once. He was immediately promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general. Mackay commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade in the later stages of the fighting around Hazebrouck. In the operations east of there in June and July, his brigade was exceptionally active in the form of minor operations and patrolling that became known as the peaceful penetration. In August, the 1st Division moved south to the Somme sector to participate in the Battle of Amiens and later the attack on the Hindenburg Line. Through his \\"careful preliminary preparations and sound tactical knowledge\\", Mackay contributed to the successes of his brigade and was once more mentioned in despatches. (Mentioned in Despatches ‚Äì Amiens) For his service as a brigade commander, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1919 New Year Honours. (Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George) He was also awarded the French Croix de guerre for his service on the Western Front. (Croix de guerre) Between the wars alt=Formal portrait of a couple After the end of the war Mackay took advantage of Brigadier General George Long's education scheme to study physics at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford. His first child, Jean Margaret, was born in Cambridge in 1919. Iven and Marjorie later had two more children ‚Äì a son, Iven John, born in Sydney in 1920, and another daughter, Alison, born in Sydney in 1930. They returned to Australia aboard the transport Mantua, which reached Sydney on 19 February 1920. With the war over, the AIF was demobilised, and Mackay's appointment to the AIF was terminated on 4 April 1920. Mackay returned to lecturing in physics at the University of Sydney. Between 1922 and 1932 he was student adviser. From 1925 he was also faculty secretary. From 1932 to 1940 Mackay also worked evenings as a Commonwealth Film Appeals Censor. In 1933, he was appointed headmaster of Cranbrook School, Sydney. The school's constitution was changed to allow Mackay, a Presbyterian, to hold the post. As a result of a case of mistaken identity following the death of Major General James Mackay in 1935, Mackay got to read his own obituary in The Times, entitled \\"Athlete, Soldier and Headmaster\\". He normally avoided publicity, but this incident brought him to national attention. Mackay remained active in the Militia throughout the inter-war period. He held the rank of honorary brigadier general from 21 January 1920 to late June 1937, when he was promoted to that rank substantively. He commanded the 9th Infantry Brigade from 1 July 1920 to 30 April 1921; the 8th Infantry Brigade from 1 May 1921 to 30 April 1926; and the 5th Infantry Brigade from 1 May 1930 to 31 December 1932. On 24 March 1937 he took command of the 2nd Division. He was promoted to major general on 1 July 1937. Mackay was one of only four Militia officers to be substantively promoted to that rank between 1929 and 1939. His term of office at Cranbrook ended acrimoniously after Justice Kenneth Street and others blamed Mackay for the school's slow recovery from the Great Depression, and the school council voted to remove him on 25 October 1939. Mackay was given twelve months' notice. When, in December 1939, Mackay's daughter Jean married Lieutenant W. H. Travers, the grandson of Major General William Holmes; the reception was held at Cranbrook. Second World War Arthur Allen, Major General Iven Mackay, Brigadier Horace Robertson. Back row, left to right: Colonel Frank Berryman, Brigadier Stanley Savige, Colonel Alan Vasey At the outbreak of war in 1939, Mackay was ranked seventh on the army's seniority list. Following formation of a second infantry division for the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940, Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey was elevated to command of the newly created I Corps. Mackay was selected to command the 7th Division on the advice of General Sir Brudenell White but Cabinet, after consulting with Blamey, switched this appointment to the 6th Division. Mackay assumed command on 4 April 1940, receiving the serial number NX363, and sailed from Melbourne for the Middle East on the ocean liner RMS Strathaird on 15 April. The troops nicknamed him \\"Mr Chips\\", after the title character of the best selling 1934 novel Goodbye, Mr. Chips and the subsequent 1939 film, a reference to his peacetime profession, but also to the impression he gave of being cool, reserved and strict. Some of his staff had reservations about him. Colonel Alan Vasey, his Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General, asserted that Mackay lacked the ruthlessness to remove Militia officers who were not performing well. Vasey fumed about \\"that bloody schoolteacher who wants to dot every 'i' and cross every 't'\\". Many regular officers were embittered by years of slow promotion followed by Prime Minister Robert Menzies ordering that commands in the 6th Division be given to Militia officers. Colonel Frank Berryman considered this \\"a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We, the only people who really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows\\". Berryman, who worked closely with Mackay as his chief of staff, held him in high regard. \\"For moral and physical courage\\", said Berryman, \\"few equalled him‚Äînone ever surpassed him. He was an educated and most knowledgeable soldier ... and extremely patient\\". His Commander, Royal Australian Artillery, a reservist, Brigadier Edmund Herring, considered Mackay \\"a most competent and able commander in North Africa and Greece, but a bit old ... Modest, dignified, shy and scholarly ... In action he never knew the meaning of fear ...\\" =Libya= His appointment to command the 6th Division meant that Mackay led its‚Äîand the Australian Army's‚Äîfirst battles of the war. Doubts about Mackay's ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to Operation Compass. During the Battle of Bardia, in Libya in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. For this success, Mackay was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). (Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire) In a war of rapid movement over long distances, Mackay demonstrated careful planning and recognised the need to reinforce success. He also impressed others with the way he cared for soldiers' lives. \\"Not only do I want Tobruk quickly\\", he told his brigadiers before the battle, \\"but I also want it cheaply\\". The victory at Bardia was followed by successes at Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi. =Greece= alt=Four soldiers, dressed warmly with three of them wearing steel helmets, in front of a 2 pounder anti tank gun The 6th Division's next campaign was the failed Battle of Greece, a disaster for the British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi Pass at the Battle of Vevi. The Allies were forced to retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. As in Libya, Mackay shared the hardships of living in the field with his men, and impressed them by his coolness during air raids. They watched him sit in the open during attacks; on one such occasion on 19 April 1941, Mackay waited out a two-and-a-half-hour raid when his car was hit and his driver wounded. One staff officer \\"noticed Mackay moving in front of his tent quite unconcerned about the movement of enemy planes. He neither looked at the planes nor at the men dashing about, but they saw him, and those moving towards shelter stopped, and many of those who had gained shelter returned to their duties. Personal example is the only paying proposition in such circumstances\\". For his actions in Greece, he was mentioned in despatches a sixth time, (Mentioned in Despatches ‚Äì Greece) and awarded the Greek War Cross (First Class). (Greek War Cross) Casualties in Greece included Mackay's son-in-law, Captain W. H. Travers, who was captured in the Battle of Crete. Mackay resolved to reform the battalions that had been destroyed in Greece, and to rebuild his shattered division from the remnants that had been evacuated to Alexandria. He developed a training program in Syria in which he attempted to apply the lessons of the campaign in Greece. =Defence of Australia= alt=Formal portrait of a young man in Australian Army uniform One lesson of Greece was that modern war was a young man's trade. Brigadier Sydney Rowell recommended to Blamey that all generals over the age of 50 be retired. In July 1941, Ernest Turnbull, representing the motion picture industry, approached Menzies and several members of his Cabinet about the possibility of Mackay becoming Chief Commonwealth Film Censor. Menzies had a different post in mind. On 24 July 1941 the War Cabinet decided to appoint a General Officer Commanding Home Forces. In a cable to Blamey, Menzies stipulated that the War Cabinet wanted a high-ranking officer like Mackay with active service in the current war. Blamey replied that he considered \\"Mackay most suitable for the appointment\\". On 14 August 1941, Mackay handed over command of the 6th Division to Herring. Mackay departed Cairo for Australia by flying boat on 22 August. En route, he stopped in Singapore to confer with Bennett, now the commander of the 8th Division, which was based there, and had dinner at the Raffles Hotel with his son, Lieutenant Iven Mackay, an officer with the 8th Division's 2/18th Infantry Battalion. Mackay assumed command of Home Forces on 1 September 1941, with the rank of lieutenant general. His task was to prepare the Militia to repel a Japanese invasion. Official historian Dudley McCarthy noted that: : With the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, Mackay's son Iven became a prisoner of war of the Japanese. A Japanese invasion of Australia now became a real possibility, so Mackay submitted a contingency plan in which he outlined a defence strategy whereby the army would concentrate on the defence of the most vital areas of eastern and southern Australia. This later gave rise to the controversial but mythical \\"Brisbane Line\\". Regular officers took the opportunity to give Mackay petty snubs. Army Headquarters continually addressed him as \\"major general\\", although his promotion to lieutenant general had been gazetted, and his pay was only ¬£1,564 compared with Sturdee's ¬£2,269. His AIF serial number was taken away from him and he was sent a new recruit's papers to fill in. The Military Board even attempted to bring him before a medical board to decide his fitness for further service. Only the intervention of the Minister for the Army, Frank Forde, averted this. During a sweeping reorganisation of the army by Blamey, Mackay became commander of the Second Army on 6 April 1942. =New Guinea= alt=Two soldiers in khaki uniforms and slouch hats When Blamey relieved Rowell of command of I Corps in New Guinea, he nominated Herring as successor. Blamey proposed Mackay as a second choice but preferred Herring as he was much younger, and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate. When Blamey relinquished command of New Guinea Force on 30 January 1943, he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable Herring to go on leave. The period was a quiet one, with no major operations being carried out, and Mackay handed back to Herring and returned to command of the Second Army at Parramatta, New South Wales, in May 1943. On 28 August 1943, Mackay once again assumed command of New Guinea Force. This time, important operations were being undertaken in the Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Junior commanders felt that Mackay should have been more forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea. Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force. =India= In November 1943, it was announced that Prime Minister John Curtin, with Blamey's approval, had appointed Mackay as High Commissioner to India. Sir Iven and Lady Mackay sailed from Perth, on SS Tanda on 14 February 1944. Their arrival in Delhi marked the beginning of an Australian diplomatic presence in India. When Lieutenant Iven Mackay was liberated, the Supreme Allied Commander of South East Asia Command, Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had him brought to Delhi to be reunited with his family. With the war's end, Mackay retired from the army on 27 February 1946, and the post of High Commissioner gradually became a civilian one. India was not yet independent, but was about to become so, and Mackay met with future leaders Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Mackay and the Minister for External Affairs, Dr H. V. Evatt, supported Indian independence, while expressing the hope that India would remain in the British Commonwealth. Mackay also promoted trade between India and Australia, and fostered a plan for Indian students and technicians to study and train in Australia. His term as high commissioner ended in May 1948. Post war Mackay was approached to consider nomination as a Liberal Party of Australia candidate for the Australian Senate, but declined. Instead, he accepted a directorship of Australian Cotton Textile Industries. From 1950 to 1952, he chaired the New South Wales recruiting committee which was set up by the Federal government to increase enlistment in the armed forces. The University of Sydney appointed Mackay an honorary Esquire Bedell in 1950 and awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in 1952. When Blamey died in 1951, Mackay rushed to Melbourne to be one of his pallbearers. Mackay visited Greece in 1952 for the unveiling of a memorial to British Commonwealth servicemen who died in the 1941 campaign. In 1961, he returned for the dedication of the Commonwealth War Cemetery at Faliro. This time he also revisited the Gallipoli battlefields, sailing to the Dardanelles on as a guest of Field Marshal Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Mackay climbed from the beach at ANZAC Cove up to Lone Pine once more. When it became known that he was visiting the United States in 1961, the US Army took him to see Fort Sill. Mackay died at his home in East Lindfield, New South Wales, on 30 September 1966 and was cremated after a service at St Stephen's, Sydney. He was survived by his wife, his son and his two daughters. Veterans lined the streets and he had ten generals for his pallbearers: Herring, Woodward, Stevens, Pulver, Stevenson, Macarthur-Onslow, Dougherty, Harrison, Cullen and Galleghan. Mackay's papers and portraits are held in the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.Mackay's papers and portraits held at the Australian War Memorial: ;Papers * 3DRL/6433 , 32 items, letters written between April 1968 and September 1970. * 3DRL/6850 , Extensive collection of material relating to Mackay's First and Second World War service as well as his time in India.

However, the vast majority of hits from non-3M sources, including newspaper searches, Google, Google Books, and Google Scholar use the forms Thermofax, or thermofax, with lower-case f, no hyphen, and no trademark symbol. ) is 3M's trademarked name for a photocopying technology which was introduced in 1950.: \\"In the 1950s, 3M introduced the Thermo-Fax copying process...\\": \\"The biggest seller was the Thermofax, introduced in 1950 by Minnesota Mining & Mfg. (3M). It was based on the thermographic process discovered by Carl S. Miller while he was studying for a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry at the University of Minnesota in 1940.\\" It was a form of thermographic printing and an example of a dry silver process.The original 1950 process did not use silver, but a few years later the original process was supplanted by an improved silver-based version. It was a significant advance as no chemicals were required, other than those contained in the copy paper itself. A thin sheet of heat sensitive copy paper was placed on the original document to be copied, and exposed to infrared energy. Wherever the image on the original paper contained carbon, the image absorbed the infrared energy when heated. The heated image then transferred the heat to the heat sensitive paper producing a blackened copy image of the original. Model 12 The first commercially available Thermofax machine was the Model 12. The 'layup' of the original and the copy paper was placed on a stationary glass platen and an infrared lamp and reflector assembly moved beneath the glass, radiating upwards. The layup was held in position by a lid with an inflatable rubber bladder that was latched down by the user. Model 17 In subsequent versions, beginning with the Model 17, the layup was fed into a slot, and continuously exposed as it passed the lamp and reflector. The Model 17 and successors were table-top machines, approximately the size of a typewriter from the same era. Q system A variation of this technology was a billing system called the Q System, typically used by medical and dental offices. A 'master' composed of a sheet of heavy backing paper and a thin sheet of ruled paper attached to it at the top edge was created for each patient. Billing entries were then made in pencil on the thin sheet for each patient visit. To create a billing copy, a sheet of heat sensitive paper was inserted between the backing and the entry sheet and passed through the ThermoFax machine, the Model 47 being the most commonly used. Transparencies As copying technology advanced, Thermofax machines were subsequently marketed as a method of producing transparencies (viewgraphs) for overhead projector presentations. A sheet of heat-sensitive clear stock was placed on top of the original, and passed through a ThermoFax, producing a black image on the clear stock. This application saw a common usage well into the 1980s, and specialized uses thereafter. Modern uses As of 2009, Thermofax machines were still widely used by artists. In addition to making copies, Thermofax machines can be used to make a \\"spirit master\\" for spirit duplicator machines. Tattoo artists use these spirit masters as tattoo stencils, to quickly and accurately mark the outlines of a tattoo on the skin of the person to be tattooed using a transfer solution. Textile and Printmaking artists use these machines for creating silk screens in several seconds by running a piece of Riso film through with a photocopied image. Riso film is a Japanese silk screen product composed of a Saran-type plastic that has been bonded to a screen mesh of various sizes. When the Riso film is exposed to the infrared bulb inside the machine, the saran plastic emulsion side opens up wherever there is an ink toner on the photocopy. Paint and other mediums can then be screened once the film is mounted on a frame. The imaging barrel inside the Thermofax is 8.5\\" wide, but the film can be of any length. These modern uses have kept up the demand for most of the models of Thermofax machines. Model 45EGA was manufactured with an electrical defect that requires a conversion kit to be installed for safe use of the machine. The 45EGA models that were not converted, are still considered to be fire hazards. Disadvantages The Thermofax process was temperamental. The coated paper tended to curl, and being heat-sensitive, copies were not archival. \\"Archival records created by Thermofax, Verifax, Mimeograph, Ditto, and Earlier xerographic processes are often very fugitive and should be copied onto archival bond paper.\\" The darkness setting is tricky to adjust, and drifts as the machine warms up. The darkness often varies, some portions of the text being too light and others being too dark. Since the heat absorption of the ink does not necessarily correlate with its visible appearance, there were occasional idiosyncrasies; some inks that looked nearly black to the eye might not copy at all, and an exposure setting that worked well for some originals might require a change to make usable copies with another. Cost comparison Thermofax copies were inexpensive. One business book asserts that research conducted by Xerox before introducing their copier came to the conclusion that \\"nobody would pay 5¬¢ for a plain-paper copy when they could get a Thermofax copy for a cent-and-a-half.\\" Fortunately, \\"Xerox ignored the research.\\" p. 143. (The accuracy of the quotation is, however, suspect, as the company was not named Xerox at the time, and early Xerox leasing charges were far higher than 5¬¢ per page.) US Army terminology In some segments of the US Army the contemporary terminology for a Thermofax copier was the \\"burn machine,\\" named so because of the heat involved in the process and the warmth of the resulting copy. Resultant terminology included \\"a burn copy\\" and \\"burn a copy.\\" Possibly apocryphal, a senior officer is said to have once ordered, with respect to an important classified document, \\"Burn this for me.\\" In response to which, a junior officer did just that. Contemporary references Contemporary references to the Thermofax process were not complimentary: :They did have-- what did they call that brown stuff? Thermofax, right. That's the first copying machine and they didn't look like anything at all. They were brown and they faded. p. 74 :Marjorie Spock had invested in one of the earliest models of thermofax machines, which she kept in her basement. It was a crude affair that continually overheated, belching smoke and vile-smelling fumes from odd sprockets and sending out scorched brown paper, sometimes completely burned and only barely legible at best., p. 320 :The only thing we had then, was what they called a thermofax machine, which was very strange. It was on a very bad tissue paper kind of thing and a very obscure image. But we were desperate and it was the only way to make copies., p. 43 Cultural references * Thermofax is the name of a dragon in the text adventure Wishbringer by Infocom. * The Lord of the Rings parody Bored of the Rings, written by National Lampoon founders Henry N.

The village is a service centre for surrounding agricultural production. The majority of the population was Christian, with Anglicans accounting for nearly half of the population, followed by Catholics and Presbyterians. Around 30% of the population was studying non-school based qualifications. The unemployment rate was 4%. The region's agriculture industries are diverse and include irrigated crops (such as cotton and pecans), as well as livestock (mostly beef cattle) and cropping (mostly cereals and rotational legumes). The pecan industry is now well established but growth in other novel crops, including olives, demonstrates a high level of innovation in agriculture.

Despite its name, it is not a true finch, but rather a member of the family Passerellidae, which also includes American sparrows, juncos and towhees. This is a common bird in wet mountain forests, second growth, bamboo clumps, scrubby pasture and bushy clearings from 1700 m altitude to the timberline. When not breeding, it can descend to 1200 m on the Caribbean slopes. The nest, built by the female, is a bulky cup of plant material hidden in coarse grasses, bamboo or a thickly-foliaged tree 0.7-4.6 m above the ground. The female lays two brown- blotched white or pale blue eggs, which she incubates for 12‚Äì14 days. The yellow-thighed brushfinch is a long-tailed species, 18.5 cm long and weighing 31 g. The adult is mainly dark grey, becoming black on the crown, throat, wings and tail, and with an olive tinge to the belly and breast. The bright yellow thighs contrast with the otherwise drab plumage, and give this species its English and scientific names. Young birds have duller, sootier plumage with a brown tone to the underparts, and olive-brown thighs. The yellow- thighed brushfinch has a heavy metallic tchuk call, and pairs have a twittering tinkling greeting. The male's song consists of high dry notes, tee tididee dee wink wink, or similar phrases. The yellow-thighed brushfinch feeds at all levels from the treetops to the ground, taking insects and spiders and many berries. It will also squeeze nectar from flowers. It is seen in pairs, family groups or in mixed-species feeding flocks with other small birds such as warblers. It can be very approachable.

It continues to be sold under the \\"Farmers Union\\" banner, originally a South Australian co-operative, subsequently the listed company National Foods, and then by a series of subsidiaries of the Japanese brewing company Kirin. The current manufacturer's company name is Lion Dairy & Drinks. Launch First launched in 1977 when Farmers Union was a co-operative of South Australian dairy farmers, the brand has achieved iconic status in South Australia and is now also available in all other Australian states and territories. Branded as ‚Äúiced coffee‚Äù, the coffee milk drink is made with coffee, glucose, and homogenised reduced fat milk and milk solids. In the past Farmers Union Iced Coffee's labelling also made mention of \\"iced confection\\" as an ingredient. The flavour of the product changed considerably when this ingredient was removed. The product is available predominantly in 600 mL and smaller 375 mL cardboard cartons. However, the 375 mL cartons werechanged in 2019 to 300 mL bottles, much like the ‚ÄúStubby‚Äù style of the 750 mL bottles. The standard 600 mL cartons remain the same. It is also sold in 2 litre plastic cartons and 500 mL bottles. It was also sold in 3 litre plastic cartons up until 2017 and 1 litre cardboard cartons up until 2013. In 2003, Australians consumed in excess of 22 million litres, making it Australia's best selling flavoured milk drink/milk shake at that time.Convenience Report 2004, ACNielsen (PDF document)? The drink's popularity has more recently been reflected by some McDonald's, KFC and Hungry Jack's restaurants beginning to sell it as a part of their menus across the country. In 2008, Farmers Union Iced Coffee outsold Coca-Cola in South Australia at a rate of almost 3:1, with South Australians consuming 36 million litres, making it the only place in the world where a milk drink outsells a cola product, and one of the few places where Coca-Cola is not the most popular locally consumed bottled beverage, a feat shared by Inca Kola in Peru and Irn-Bru in Scotland and various drinks in nearly every Asian country. Also, the drink holders of the locally made third generation Mitsubishi Magna and first generation of the Holden Cruze were designed to hold both normal round drinks and Farmers Union Iced Coffee cartons. Commercials Farmers Union Iced Coffee in Australia also enjoys a high profile for popular commercials featuring rough male workers acting out ballet with heavy machinery in order to take up their boss on his word that he would provide them with a truck load of Iced Coffee if all his workers took up ballet. Another well-known run of advertisements features a dramatic voice-over detailing world headlines and issues, but shows very low-key average Australian equivalents on screen. These include: *\\"When the wall came down\\" - depicts two men demolishing a wall as part of a DIY project. This relates to when the Berlin Wall was demolished. *\\"Survived the Apollo Disaster\\" - shows three motorists (one consuming Iced Coffee) as their Holden Apollo is towed away after an accident. This may refer to one of two major incidents involving Apollo spacecraft‚Äîeither the Apollo 1 fire, in which three astronauts died during a launch-pad test exercise, or the Apollo 13 explosion, which scuttled a planned lunar landing but saw the three astronauts safely return to Earth. *\\"There when the bras were burnt\\" - shows an absent minded male watching television as a bra is burnt by an iron in the foreground. This refers to the famous act of female liberation. *\\"When Chisel broke up\\" - shows a construction site with a devastated builder holding two pieces of a broken chisel. Refers to when the band, Cold Chisel broke up. *\\"Saw Cathy in Sydney in 2000\\" - shows one male supposedly meeting with an old friend in Sydney who is also named Cathy. Relates to Cathy Freeman winning the 400 m in the Sydney Olympics. *\\"The Children Overboard\\" - shows two males in a speedboat talking as their children have fallen off the back in an inflatable that is being towed. Refers to the scandal when the Howard government falsely claimed that children were thrown overboard from a boat full of asylum seekers. *\\"Lived through the Millennium Bug\\" - shows a man in a dinner suit in a sleeping bag drink an Iced Coffee while slapping a bug on his neck. Relates to the Y2K bug. *\\"...and Trevor's Underarm\\" - shows two construction workers both drinking Iced Coffee; one lifts his arm revealing his body odour and the other recoils in disgust. Refers to Trevor Chappell's infamous underarm delivery on the last ball of a One Day Cricket International. Features actor Terry Rogers in an early role. *\\"Strongly opposed the Bush Invasion\\" - shows a man cutting his neighbours overhanging bushes. Relates to the opposition of George Bush leading the invasion into Iraq. New flavours On 23 October 2006, two new flavours of Farmers Union Iced Coffee were released in South Australia. Farmers Union Strong Iced Coffee which features a stronger coffee blend, which subsequently began sale in Tasmania, and Farmers Union Light Iced Coffee which has no added sugar (where aspartame is added as a substitute) and a taste similar to the original. According to the company, both the original variety and the Light flavours contain approximately 18 mg of caffeine per 100 mL, while the Farmers Union Strong Iced Coffee contains 24 mg. The Light Iced Coffee proved to be rather unpopular, as many consumers did not like the slightly weaker taste and instead chose the original. In August 2011, Farmers Union Iced Coffee's Facebook page with launch details. (Retrieved 17/4/12) the company released a new product, Farmers Union Iced Coffee One, claiming that One had \\"100% taste, 1% fat and no added sugar\\", and was a completely new formulation. Farmers Union Iced Coffee's Facebook Page, with 'One' and 'Light FUIC' compared. (Retrieved 17/4/12) One was not overly popular at launch, given the reputation of the Light Iced Coffee, leading to a huge promotion in December 2011, where customers who 'liked' the On the Run Facebook page could print a coupon from the internet, and redeem one of 10,000 free Iced Coffee Ones from any petrol station or convenience outlet in South Australia.

Note the presence of the rotated yellow bar on the front bumper. A school bus crossing arm is a safety device intended to protect children from being struck while crossing in front of a school bus. Typically, school bus crossing arms are wire or plastic devices which extend from the front bumper on the right side of the bus while it is stopped for loading/unloading and form a barrier. The devices force children, who need to cross the road, to stand several feet in front of the bus itself before they can begin to cross the road. This ensures that the bus driver can see them as they cross, avoiding a common blind spot immediately in front of the bus, closest to the bumper. The crossing arm retracts flush against the bumper while not activated, such as when the bus is in motion. Unlike traffic warning lights and many other safety-related features typically found on school buses in the United States, crossing arms are not required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) for School Buses. Regulations for equipment and use vary widely on a state-by-state basis. In some places, they are optional at the discretion of a local school district or school bus contractor. The 1990 death of six-year-old Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Anderson, in Washington State, led to the installation of school bus crossing arms, also referred to as \\"Betsy Bars\\" or \\"Betsy Gates\\" on all Washington state school busses by 1992. The crossing arms, when extended, require students to cross at least 5 feet in front of the bus. In Manitoba, Canada, provincial school buses have been required to have an extendable safety arm mounted on the bus since a seven-year-old boy died in 1996 in St. Norbert, after getting off his school bus.

St. Yves (1253‚Äì1303) studied civil law at Orl√©ans, and Pope Clement V also studied there law and letters; by a Papal Bull published at Lyon, 27 January 1306, he endowed the Orl√©ans institutes with the title and privileges of a University (it has been founded as one of the very earliest universities outside Italy in 1235, only two years after Cambridge, in France only Paris' Sorbonne was even older). Twelve later popes granted the new university many privileges. In the 14th century it had as many as five thousand students from France, Germany, Lorraine, Burgundy, Champagne, Picardy, Normandy, Touraine, Guyenne and Scotland.

He was later president of Myspace and a strategic adviser for the company until he left in 2009. Anderson is popularly known as \\"Tom from Myspace\\" and \\"Myspace Tom\\", because, until 2010, he would automatically be assigned as the first \\"friend\\" of new Myspace users upon the creation of their profiles. Early life Anderson's father was an entrepreneur. As a teenager at San Pasqual High in Escondido, California, Anderson was a computer hacker under the pseudonym \\"Lord Flathead\\" (friends with Bill Landreth), and prompted a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raid after he cracked the security of Chase Manhattan Bank. He was not arrested because of his young age (14). Anderson studied English and rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley, prior to becoming the lead singer of a band called \\"Swank\\". Anderson then lived in Taiwan for some time, before returning to the United States to study for a degree in critical film studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. Career Anderson was a product tester and copywriter at XDrive, a digital storage company in 2000, where he first met DeWolfe. He initially joined XDrive as a product tester after answering a flyer advertisement, while still at film school and looking to earn extra money. After XDrive went bankrupt in 2001, he and DeWolfe founded the direct marketing company ResponseBase. They sold ResponseBase to Brad Greenspan's eUniverse in late 2002. With other eUniverse employees, Anderson set up the first pages of Myspace in August 2003. He founded the site partly as a reaction to Friendster and its policy of blocking accounts that did not use real names. Intermix Media was then founded as the successor of eUniverse, and it was under Intermix that Myspace garnered the level of popularity for which it is notable. When Intermix Media and Myspace were sold to News Corp, Anderson became president of the company. Myspace was sold to News Corp in 2005 for $580 million. Following the News Corp acquisition, Anderson said: \\"Before [the acquisition], I could do whatever I wanted. Now it takes more time to get people to agree on things. All the budget reviews and processes. That can be a pain. But it's not stopping us.\\" Reuters quoted an unnamed News Corp executive as saying: \\"Tom [Anderson] was responsible for the product, but ended up being a complete bottleneck on getting things done.\\" Anderson was replaced as president in April 2009 by News Corp; by 2010, he was no longer the default friend on Myspace, and was replaced by a profile called \\"Today On MySpace,\\" or \\"T.O.M.\\" In late May 2012, Anderson announced that he would be joining RocketFrog Interactive as an adviser to the 16-person Los Angeles‚Äìbased company, which created a Facebook app. However, in a September 2014 interview, Anderson did not mention any advisory roles in his life at the time, while his Twitter blurb as of November 2018 reads, in part: \\"Enjoying being retired.\\" He explained in the interview that he is not interested in returning to his previous vocation, but concluded: \\"I'll never say 'never' because, more than anything, I like the idea that anything can happen. I don't know exactly where my life will lead. Adventure and the unknown has always been appealing to me.\\" Media appearances Anderson made a cameo appearance in the 2009 American comedy-drama film Funny People starring Adam Sandler. Personal life Anderson is active on other social media platforms, including Facebook and Reddit. Following an experience with photography at the 2011 Burning Man festival, Anderson's interest in his own photography was piqued. In a September 2014 ABC News interview, Anderson credited friend and photographer Trey Ratcliff for facilitating his skill development and explained: \\"I'm not necessarily trying to represent nature exactly. I'm trying to make something beautiful like a painter would.\\" Anderson travels globally with friends to locations such as Thailand and Myanmar, where he primarily focuses upon landscape images. Anderson also explained in September 2014 that his personal interests have always been diverse: > If you knew me before Myspace, you'd probably thought I'd have been a > scholar teaching philosophy in a university my whole life. If you met me > before college, you'd probably have thought I'd be a musician for my entire > life ... I like change.

Album information The 7th Blues was released as a double album in March 1994 after their successful \\"PLEASURE LIVE-GYM '93 - JAP THE RIPPER\\" tour. This album was to fully cement B'z evolution from synthesizer-driven pop to mainstream rock. The experimentation is also of note, as it follows the familiar pattern of excess that so frequently comes with most double albums in the rock and roll genre, most notably Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk\\", although nowhere nearly as wild or juxtaposed as Lindsay Buckingham's studio work on said album. The First disc contains a more rock style that B'z built their career on. Notable tracks include \\"LOVE IS DEAD,\\" which is very jazz oriented; \\"Strings of My Soul\\", an instrumental song that Tak performed during previous Live-Gyms, and \\"Akai Kawa\\", which features a lengthy string and keyboard introduction. The Second disc bases itself more on blues songs. Notable songs include \\"Jap the Ripper\\", a previously unreleased song that was played during the aforementioned tour; \\"Slave to the Night\\", a re-recording of \\"Heart wo Nureru Number\\" from the band's debut album, comprising new English lyrics with an extended intro; \\"Lady Navigation\\", a bluesy acoustic version of the 1991 single with all English lyrics. Rounding out the balance of the album is \\"Mou Karimakka\\", a Kansai Blues-inspired track written in Kansai dialect, reflecting Tak's hometown of Osaka. B'z took the time to experiment with several sounds, and draw upon their influences, including Aerosmith (Kohshi's vocal style is very reminiscent to Steven Tyler in \\"Don't Leave Me\\"), The Beatles (heard most directly in \\"farewell song\\"), Eric Clapton (The Leslie effected riff for \\"Queen of Madrid\\"), Led Zeppelin (most notably in Tak's homage to \\"Heartbreaker\\" in the bridge), Jimi Hendrix (intro riff to \\"SLAVE TO THE NIGHT\\"), and Van Halen (The intro riff to \\"JAP THE RIPPER\\"). Tak's eclectic studio session background, and his musical influences of blues, classical, jazz, pop, and rock are very apparent in the arrangement as well. The catalog code for this album is BMCR-6601-2. The logo featured in the middle of the album cover resembles the logo that Aerosmith has been using in their album covers. The album broke the million copies mark with over 1,049,900 copies sold in its first week and eventually sold over 1,630,450 copies in total.

It was the first major international religious conference in China since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Over 1,000 monks and experts from 37 countries and regions attended the forum, giving speeches or participating in discussions under the theme of \\"A harmonious world begins in the mind.\\" Among the participants was Gyaincain Norbu, the then 16-year-old Chinese-approved 11th Panchen Lama, who was the figurehead of the forum, and made very rare public appearances. However, according to a news story by Reuters, fellow Buddhists appeared to shun him during opening ceremonies. This forum did not include the current and exiled 14th Dalai Lama, who is viewed by China as a separatist. According to Qi Xiaofei, vice-director of the Chinese state administration for religious affairs, \\"The Dalai Lama is not only a religious figure, but is also a long-time stubborn secessionist who has tried to split his Chinese motherland and break the unity among different ethnic groups.\\" Proposal Eight disciples from the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan proposed the World Buddhist Forum in China in 2004, a suggestion that won support from Buddhist circles in countries like Japan and the Republic of Korea. From October 2004 to November 2005, with the common propagation of the Buddhist communities of Hong Kong, Macao and across the Taiwan Strait, the proposal of hosting the World Buddhist Forum in Mainland China won universal support and an active response from Buddhist communities in over 40 countries. The Chinese government gave assurances it would support the Buddhist community to host the grand historic event. =Overseers of the First World Buddhist Forum= *Venerable Master Yi Cheng, President, Buddhist Association of China. *Losang Jigm√™ Tubdain Qoigyi Nyima, 6th Jamyang Zhepa and abbot, Labrang Monastery; Vice President, Buddhist Association of China. *Venerable Master Ben Huan, Director, Buddhist Association of China. *Venerable Master Hsing Yun, Founder, Fo Guang Shan Monastery, Taiwan. *Huba Longzhuangmeng, Abbot of Xishuangbanna Monastery. *Venerable Master Wei Chueh, Founder, Chung Tai Shan Monastery, Taiwan. *Venerable Master Sheng Hui, Vice President and Dean of the Chinese Buddhist Academy. *Venerable Master Kok Kwong, President of the Hong Kong Buddhist Association.

The Court is an inferior court to the Supreme Court of Tasmania and, in terms of the Australian court hierarchy, is at the bottom level.  Jurisdiction of the court  The Court has jurisdiction in a number of areas, including less serious criminal matters, civil claims involving less than $50,000 or where the parties consent, certain administrative appeals, child protection, youth justice, and coronial matters. The majority of the Court's workload is in less serious (or \\"summary\\") offences; the Court also has jurisdiction over serious (or \\"indictable\\") crimes where the value of the property involved, or the nature of the crime, means that the matter may be heard by the Magistrates Court of Tasmania according to Tasmanian law. Criminal matters in the Magistrates Court are generally heard by a single magistrate sitting alone and do not involve a jury. Serious criminal matters are heard by the Supreme Court of Tasmania after having been \\"committed\\" to the Supreme Court by the Magistrates' Court. This committal no longer involves an examination of whether or not the defendant has a case to answer but is normally a formal procedural step. The Court also deals with civil disputes involving property valued at less than $50,000. Disputes involving $5,000 or less are heard by the Court's Civil Division as a minor civil claim. Appeals from the Magistrates' Court of Tasmania in all matters are to a single judge of the Supreme Court of Tasmania.  Structure of the court  The Magistrates' Court of Tasmania operates from four courthouses in Tasmania, located in Burnie, Devonport, Launceston and Hobart.

He composed a large number of works, mainly on a small scale and often of an educational nature though with some larger-scale orchestral and choral works. He was a dedicated teacher, broadcaster and writer; after his death the Alec Rowley Memorial Prize was established at Trinity College of Music. Life and works Rowley was born in London on 13 March 1892. He entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1908, where he studied under Frederick Corder, H.W. Richards and Edward Morton. He won several prizes, including the Mortimer and Prescott prizes for composition. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists (FRCO) in 1914, and held a succession of church organist appointments: at St John's, Richmond, 1912‚Äì21, St Alban's, Teddington 1921‚Äì32 and, during the Second World War, at St Margaret's, Westminster. From 1920 he was a lecturer at Trinity College of Music, later a professor and Fellow of the college. He became well known as a broadcaster during the 1930s, through a series of piano duets with Edgar Moy. From 1939 to 1947 he served as a member of the Royal Philharmonic Society's management committee. He became a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (FRAM) in 1934. As a composer, Rowley produced a large body of works, many of which were educational pieces or were designed for amateur performers. His larger- scale works include two piano concertos from 1938, an Oboe Concerto, a Rhapsody for viola and orchestra, and several keyboard pieces including two symphonies for organ. His Three Idylls for piano and orchestra, and Burlesque Quadrilles, were premiered at wartime Promenade concerts in the Royal Albert Hall, and his English Suite and Boyhood of Christ were performed by the Hall√© Orchestra at the Cheltenham Festival in 1949 and 1954 respectively. Rowley wrote a large number of songs and choral pieces, both sacred and secular; these include a Nativity play On Bethlehem Hill (1958). In his compositions, Rowley generally avoided modernity, although on occasion he was not afraid to experiment with more modern harmonic forms. He wrote or contributed to a number of books, mainly of an educational nature, such as Four Hands, One Piano (1940); Practical Musicianship (1941); and Extemporisation: a Treatise for Organists (1955). Among his educational piano works is the short piece \\"The Rambling Sailor\\", which was chosen as one of ten test pieces for the Daily Express national piano playing competition in 1928, and recorded as a demonstration by William Murdoch.MusicWeb International\\"The Rambling Sailor\\", played by William Murdoch, on The Complete Columbia Solo Electrical Recordings (1925-1931), APR6029 (2019) He also acted as musical adviser and reader to a number of publishing houses. Rowley died at his home in Shepperton while playing tennis on 12 January 1958, aged sixty-five. A memorial service was held at St Sepulchre's Church, High Holborn, on 7 March 1958. After his death, Trinity College established the Alec Rowley Memorial Prize. In 1970 the Alec Rowley Pianoforte Recital Prize was established by Professor Alfred Kitchen.

Camp Hope has welcomed people from all over the United States and all over the world who have come to participate in the massive recovery efforts of St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Camp Hope provides affordable housing and meals for groups and individuals who have come to serve St Bernard parish and the city of New Orleans. Breakfast and dinner are served throughout the work week, as well as the option to make sack lunches to take on volunteer work sites. The facilities include a large dining area, bathrooms, showers, laundry facilities, meeting rooms, and bunk rooms with enough space to sleep over 300 individuals. Formation Camp Hope opened on June 1, 2006, in the former \\"W. Smith Junior Elementary School\\" in Violet, Louisiana due to the closure of Camp Premiere, a FEMA-sponsored base camp established to provide basic life support for emergency response activities. Col. David Dysart (USMCR), the Director of The St. Bernard Parish Office of Recovery, formed alliances with multiple Non-Profit Organizations, volunteer groups and the St. Bernard School Board to relocate the camp and ensure the continued support necessary for the critical volunteer efforts to continue. The opening was facilitated by several AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps teams and overseen by St. Bernard Parish employee Tom Pfalzer. The mission of Camp Hope then, in addition to providing low-cost volunteer housing, was to facilitate volunteer relief efforts in St. Bernard Parish and in the New Orleans area. This effort included managing and participating in the removal of health and safety hazards internal to residential properties throughout St. Bernard Parish (gutting houses i.e. removing rotting furniture, drywall, kitchen appliances that held biohazards as well as more ordinary hazards such as mercury switches used in thermostats and household chemicals) and facilitate repatriation by displaced residents as a cost-effective alternative to unnecessary demolition, with the assistance of the local, state, federal, NCCC, and other volunteer and non-governmental agencies. At the end of the debris removal process, volunteers in St. Bernard had gutted over 2,500 homes in St. Bernard Parish at no cost to their owners. In January 2007, Camp Hope changed its mission to focus on rebuilding and new construction. Camp Hope was managed by the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. August 15, 2007, Camp Hope moved to the former \\"Beauregard Middle School\\" which was named after P.G.T. Beauregard, a notable Civil War General who fought for the Confederacy, in the township of St. Bernard, LA. Most volunteers who stay at Camp Hope volunteer with New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity or with the St. Bernard Project (located in Chalmette, LA) though any volunteer is welcome. In January 2010, Camp Hope reopened under St. Bernard Parish management at a new location in Arabi LA, inside the building of former St. Louise de Marillac. In the spring of 2011, as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the former Camp Hope was re-purposed to house clean-up workers. In 2012, St. Bernard Parish Government decided to pull out of the management of Camp Hope. In February 2012, a local non-profit called The Gathering took over the management of Camp Hope. They continue to run it to this day. Versions Camp Hope 2 in Beauregard Middle School closed in May 2009.

In the UK and Ireland, the expression independent bicycle dealers (IBDs) is also used. The local bike shop is a key component of the bicycle industry and, in recognition of the value that local bike shops provide, some manufacturers only sell their bicycles through dealerships.  Offerings  Beyond bicycles, a local bicycle shop may offer clothing and other accessories, spare and replacement parts, tools, and a variety of services. Services may include expert fitting and custom bike building or ordering, maintenance and repairs from experienced bicycle mechanics, and organized group rides and classes. A self-service work area may be available. Shops may also specialize on one or more aspects of cycling: bicycle racing, triathlon, bicycle touring, BMX, mountain biking, etc. Similarly, shops may carry a diverse range of bicycles, from single-seat upright bikes, to more specialized types such as tandem bicycles, recumbent bicycles, folding bicycles. Many shops also carry related items such as unicycles and skateboards. Shops located out of temperate climates may have a secondary line in order to keep busy in the off season (winter). These include goods and services for skiing, camping, and physical fitness. Some shops keep their regular customers coming in through the winter by offering group training sessions.  Studios  A small but growing trend in bicycle retailing is called the bicycle studio, which offers service in an intimate environment by appointment only. A list by Bicycling Magazine shows five studios founded before 2000 and 13 since. These are seen as more complementary to, than competitive with, traditional bike shops.  Competitors  In the US, the primary competitors to local bike shops are the mass merchants such as Wal-Mart or Target, representing 73% of the units and 36% of the dollars in 2007, full-line sporting goods stores such as Dick's Sporting Goods, multi-sport stores such as R.E.I., representing 7% of the units and 9% of the dollars in 2007, and mail order and online vendors representing 3% of the units and 6% of the dollars in 2007. There are also chains of bike shops, though most LBS are independently owned, and 91% of them have one location. The distinction between local bike shops and online vendors has begun to blur as local bike shops have begun themselves to sell products online. A recent development is the introduction of brand specific stores from bicycle manufacturers such as Trek Bicycle Corporation. Other manufacturers, such as Specialized, are strengthening their channels with concept stores.  Statistics  According to the National Bicycle Dealers Association, in 2007 there were approximately 4,400 \\"specialty bicycle retailers\\" in the USA; down from 4,800 in 2005. Although they sold only 17% of the bikes, up from 16% in 2005, they collected 49% of the dollars, up from 47% in 2005. In 2004, the average specialty bicycle retailer had gross sales of $550,000 per year, 91% of them had one location, and average store size was 4,822 square feet. :See: Graphic comparison of US auto and bike sales, 1972-2008  See also  *Bicycle *Bicycle cooperative *Bicycle industry *Bicycle mechanic *Bicycle tools *Cycling *List of bicycle manufacturers *List of bicycle part manufacturers References Category:Cycling Category:Cycling infrastructure Category:Bicycle industry ","title":"Local bike shop"},{"id":"6605617","text":"Imants Zemzaris (born 14 April 1951) is a Latvian composer and teacher.

The band has not released any new material since 2001, but has not disbanded and is thus officially still active. Their music is quite similar to that of influent French punks B√©rurier Noir: two-fingered and distorted guitar chords and drum machine as a drummer. Their lyrics evolved along their career from nonsensical and often juvenile humour to something more serious and sometimes social and political. The band had different line- ups, among which the most famous from the late 80‚Äôs featured Karim Berrouka on vocals, Nobru (real name Bruno Garcia, his new pseudonym is Sergent Garcia) on guitars, Laurent and then Charlu on bass, and Jean-Mi on programming. They made their reputation through endless and delirious shows performed by disguised musicians. Among their notable stage clothing: cycling jerseys, diving suits, Mexican ponchos and various funny headgear. Some of their songs are satires on stars like Louison Bobet, Nicolae Ceau≈üescu, Maria Callas, Jacques Chirac, Jodie Foster or deal with more serious topics like war: \\"Libannais raides\\", \\"Hiroshima\\"; drugs: \\"Le Man√®ge enchant√©\\", \\"Kaliman\\"; and misery: \\"LSD for Ethiopie\\", \\"In the Ghettos\\"‚Äîalways with irony.

He is perhaps best known for his stint in Ohio Valley Wrestling and WWE under the ring name Mr. Strongko. Early life Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, Wenzel was an amateur wrestling champion in high school and was also on his high school's varsity football and baseball teams. After graduating in 1998, Wenzel later attended Penn State University in 2001 and graduated with a degree in Business Management and marketing in 2004. Professional wrestling career After training under Afa Anoa'i and Gino Caruso, Wenzel made his debut on February 26, 1999 for Caruso's East Coast Professional Wrestling promotion with a disqualification victory over Pub Bully. Soon after his debut, Wenzel began wrestling all over the United States independent circuit, competing against and teaming with legendary performers such as The Honky Tonk Man, Legion of Doom, Brutus \\"The Barber\\" Beefcake and Jimmy \\"Superfly\\" Snuka. Wenzel then a joined Jersey Championship Wrestling full-time, forming a tag team with Danny Gimondo/Inferno called The Hybrid. =The Moondogs 2000= In 2000, Wenzel and Jak Molsoon, both wrestling as singles competitors in Independent Superstars of Professional Wrestling, joined together to form a tag team called the Moondogs 2000, renaming themselves to Moondog Wenzel and Moondog Molsoon, respectively. As their name implied, the team was that of a new version of the prominent tag team of the same name. The team found success soon after forming, as they won the promotion's Tag Team Championship on June 24, 2000 after defeating Judas Young and Ryan Wing in the finals of a tournament for the vacant title. They held the championship for 341 days, beating out Glen Osbourne and Julio Sanchez's reign by one day to become the longest reigning champions in the title's history, and they ultimately became the final champions after the promotion folded in 2001. World Xtreme Wrestling While in ISPW, the Moondogs 2000 also competed in World Xtreme Wrestling. On October 15, 2000, the Moondogs defeated the Latin Hit Squad (Nuisance and Puerto Rican Chile) to win the Tag Team Championship, their first in WXW. They would hold remain champions for a few months before losing the title back to the Latin Hit Squad on January 9, 2001. The Moondogs would then reclaim the title after defeating the New Jersey Hit Squad (Mafia and Monsta Mack) on July 13, 2001 and would hold the title for just over a month before losing it to Neil and Bob. After the title loss, Wenzel took a hiatus from wrestling. Wenzel returned to wrestling in 2003 and in that same year, he reunited with Molsoon and together, they won their third and final Tag Team Championship on January 4. The Moondogs would then lose the title to Los Lunatics (Eddie Guapo and Low Ryda) on March 8. =Ohio Valley Wrestling= After another hiatus, Wenzel made his debut in Ohio Valley Wrestling on April 12, 2006 as Alexei Strongkov, a Russian shoot fighter and \\"comrade\\" to Boris Alexiev. His ring name was soon tweaked to Mr. Strongko and in addition to being Alexiev's cornerman, Strongko would also wrestle in matches. On July 26, Strongko made his in-ring debut for OVW in a losing effort to Chet the Jett. The next day, he competed in a battle royal to name the number one contender for the Heavyweight Championship, which was won by The Miz. On August 19, Strongko wrestled in another battle royal, this time to name the number one contender for the Television Championship, which was won by Ryan Reeves. Wenzel made his World Wrestling Entertainment debut on the March 18, 2007 episode of Heat, where he and Mike Tolar lost to Cryme Tyme. After Alexiev was called up to World Wrestling Entertainment's main roster in April, Strongko began teaming with Vladimir Kozlov. Strongko and Kozlov continued to team throughout 2007 and on August 22, Strongko wrestled his last match in OVW as he lost to Jacob Duncan. =Hiatus and return= After leaving OVW, Wenzel took a two-year hiatus from wrestling before returning to the ring for Independent Superstars of Professional Wrestling's one day only reunion show, Summer Rumble, on July 11, 2009 under the ring name Stronko. At the event, he wrestled in a 20-man battle royal for the vacant ISPW Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Judas Young, and he also wrestled a tag team match with Mario Bokara in a losing effort to The Logan Brothers (Bryan and Matt).

The band's name is taken from the Misfits' long-unreleased first album, though the band's sound owes very little to the Misfits.  History  The Static Age began playing shows in their hometown in 2002 with original members Paley and Meilleur and others, and they've released a \\"full-length demo,\\" four albums and a few singles to date. As of 2011, their latest release was \\"In the City of Wandering Lights,\\" (April 19-26, 2011‚ÄîLP+Digital download) released on Highwires (US) and Flix Records (Europe). It was the followup to 2009's \\"i/o\\" on the same labels. The band's first major release was 2005's \\"Neon Nights Electric Lives\\" (produced by Matt Squire) released on Tarantulas Records/Platform Group/Fontana in March 2005. That album was followed up in 2006 by \\"Blank Screens\\" (produced by Birnbaum and Bittner) via ReIgnition Records (the sister label to Law of Inertia magazine). Other prior releases include 2004's \\"Amphibian\\" single, 2003's \\"The Past and Now\\" single, and 2003's \\"The Cost of Living\\" 'full-length demo,' released by the band's own imprint Primary Records and the now defunct Boston-based label Red Dawn Records. More can be read about these releases in the news and records archives at the band's Official website. Through their exhaustive North American touring schedule 2004-2007, tours across Europe in 2009 and 2011, and favorable attention from both the US and the UK press (many quotes on the band's official website's press section could be labeled as \\"critical acclaim\\" 2), the members of the Static Age have carved out a unique place for themselves. Their openly \\"campy\\" music videos for \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Cherry Red\\" garnered them additional notice when they aired on Fuse and MTVu from 2006 to 2007. In a more surrealistic move, the band launched the \\"Blank Screens\\" series of internet videos in December 2007. These videos are available at SeventeenScratches.com and notably do not feature the band at all. The band members also increased their collective influence through their relationship with the short-lived-but-influential Tarantulas Records, and a reputation for being both \\"art-centric\\" (a phrase originally used by Tarantulas) and fiercely independent. The band then toured throughout 2006 and 2007 in support of the \\"Blank Screens\\" album (playing with bands like Tiger Army, Street Dogs, and Theo and the Skyscrapers). The Static Age then took a touring hiatus, except for a tour across Europe in 2009, to build a studio space in Brooklyn and work on new material and sideprojects, according to posts on their website 3. Paley then relocated to Chicago in late 2009 to earn a Masters in Journalism at Northwestern University 4, bringing the studio equipment to a new space there and working on a new album with Chicago-based drummer, Joe Sowinski, while sending tapes to Meilleur for collaboration 5.

Most of the musicians went on to become top session players on the Canadian music scene throughout the 1970s and 1980s working with the likes of Bruce Cockburn, David Wiffen and Murray McLauchlan. Early years Singer Peter Shields (aka Simon Caine) first came to prominence during 1966 with the group Simon Caine & The Catch, which included bass player Dennis Pendrith, drummer John Savage, keyboard player Tom Sheret and guitarist Bill Palmer. Pendrith left in the summer for five months to play with Luke & The Apostles but rejoined that autumn. The group made a number of appearances on the Toronto club scene throughout the early part of 1967, performing at notable venues like Boris', the Red Gas Room and the Gogue Inn and sharing the stage with local bands like Jon and Lee & The Checkmates and The Paupers. By June, Pendrith had moved on to play with Livingstone's Journey and the Catch continued without him for a while. Transfusion Around July 1968, Simon Caine and Tom Sheret re-emerged with rock band, Tranfusion. The group, which also included future Chris de Burgh sideman Danny McBride on guitar; former Luke & The Apostles and David Clayton-Thomas Combine drummer Pat Little; and bass player Rick Shuckster, became the house band at the Rock Pile, one of Toronto's top live venues. Throughout the latter part of 1968, Transfusion opened for Blood, Sweat & Tears (September 20), Country Joe & The Fish (September 29), Procol Harum (October 5), the Jeff Beck Group (October 27) and Iron Butterfly (November 9) among others. Caine left the band before the year was out and maintained a low profile musically. Simon Caine returns Peter Shields formed a new version of Simon Caine (dropping The Catch) in October 1969 with original members Bill Palmer, John Savage and Dennis Pendrith, who had spent the interim playing with Olivus, 3's a Crowd and Ugly Ducklings spin-off group, GNU. The new members were pianist Pat Godfrey (born 1948 in Toronto) from The Diplomats and wind instrumentalist Bruce Pennycook (born October 5, 1949 in Toronto). The new line up signed to RCA Victor and issued a lone single, ‚ÄúWalked Out The Door‚Äù, written by Pat Godfrey and Dave Richardson, which coincided with an appearance at Toronto's Electric Circus (December 12‚Äì14, 1969). The following year, the group gigged intensively throughout southern Ontario and also completed sessions for an album at RCA Recording Studios in Toronto with producer George Semkiw, which was released in October 1970. That same month, the band returned to Toronto's live scene with a show at the Night Owl, followed by an appearance at Ryerson Great Hall alongside Leigh Ashford on November 6, 1970. Simon Caine should have seen the new year in at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, appearing at a prestigious show that also featured Johnny Winter, Rare Earth, Poco, The James Gang and fellow Canadians Chilliwack, but a disagreement over the fee meant that the band didn't appear. Despite a positive write-up in the Toronto Telegram in its October 1 issue, the album didn't sell well. The group started work on a new album in early 1971 with another producer but broke up before the sessions were completed. Aftermath Dennis Pendrith subsequently became an integral member of both Bruce Cockburn and Murray McLauchlan's backing bands and later appeared on David Wiffen's 1973 album ‚ÄúCoast To Coast Fever‚Äù. He currently plays with the Bebop Cowboys and still works with Murray McLauchlan. Godfrey, Pennycook and Savage also participated in the Wiffen project and appeared as studio session players on an array of other albums throughout the decade. Savage and Godfrey spent a brief period with Bruce Cockburn while the latter also did sessions for Tom Rush. Godfrey later moved to Vancouver Island and worked as a film animation composer. He continues to play piano and compose. Although born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Palmer returned to the United States to renovate old houses in the Florida Keys. his death did not happen as wrongly stated here previously. Palmer (Mouse) is living in North Carolina doing meticulously beautiful woodworking. Shields became a teacher at a Catholic school and lives in Toronto. Savage also lives outside Toronto and was last heard working in the construction/renovation industry. Pennycook lives in Austin, Texas where he teaches in the Department of Composition at The University of Texas at Austin and is a successful composer.

The Rugger was also called the Rocky in most export markets, and Fourtrak in the United Kingdom. It has also received a series of different names elsewhere, which is why it is often referred to by its model designation (F70 for diesel variants or F80 for petrol variants) to distinguish it from its various siblings. In Japan and the US, the Rocky name refers to the smaller F300 series of Daihatsu vehicles.  Model history  The F70/F80-series Rugger was made in the same mold as many of its Japanese competitors at the time. Dimensionally it was very similar to the short wheelbase variants of the Isuzu Trooper, Toyota Land Cruiser, Mitsubishi Pajero, and Nissan Patrol, although unlike most competitors the Rugger could seat five rather than four. The ladderframe construction with leaf sprung live front and rear axles was also typical. The four-wheel drive system required the driver to get out and lock the hubs when selecting the 4WD mode, but as of 1991 the F70/F80 switched to automatic locking hubs, engaging when the driver moved forward .Kie√üler, p. 70 A transfer case provided five extra low gears for crawling through rough terrain. Two wheelbases were built, with the longer one (F75/F85) stretched by , making it shorter than most competitors' long wheelbase models. There were no four-door models, excepting those developed by Daihatsu's Indonesian subsidiary who also used an even longer wheelbase. There was a softtop model, a hardtop, a wagon, the long wheelbase version with a higher roof, as well as a rarely seen pickup truck on the longer chassis. = 1984‚Äì1991 = The first model was sold from 1984 to 1993, replacing the F10/F20/F50/F60 series Taft. It was available in short wheelbase form with a convertible softtop or removable hardtop (F70/F80) and in long wheelbase form (F75/F85) with fibreglass top. The extended variant, called Rugger Wagon, could carry up to eight people in the back, facing each other. Three engine options were available: a Toyota 2.0 L 3Y petrol engine with single overhead cam and single carburettor producing and two 2.8 L diesel variants: a naturally aspirated variant producing and turbocharged variant producing , both featuring overhead valves. The turbodiesel appeared early in 1985. Part-time four-wheel drive was standard on all models. A Toyota diesel-engined (2L) version was sold in the Japanese market as the LD20 Toyota Blizzard. The 1984‚Äì1991 diesel models were available in short wheelbase F70, long wheelbase F75 and F77 pickup. In 1989, the DL-series diesel engine underwent a number of changes including a timing belt replacing helical timing gears, rectangular headlamps and four-wheel drive engagement in high range using an electric switch via a vacuum pipe. The code for the naturally aspirated model changed from DL41 to DL42. Later an intercooled version of the turbodiesel engine became available, with power increasing to DIN or JIS. In 1991 the Rugger/Rocky switched to automatic locking hubs.

The GTL, first shown in 1986 and later with the addition of \\"Hiline\\" badging, had a locally developed five-door station wagon body which was built on a longer wheelbase than available elsewhere. The rear doors had sliding rather than wind-down windows. There was also a mid-wheelbase version called the GTX sold from 1986 until 1988, when a similarly equipped four-wheel drive version called the Taft Rocky replaced it. The short-wheelbase rear-wheel drive model was originally called the GTS (Hiline GTS from 1988). The Hiline GTL was also available in four-wheel drive option. All Indonesian-built F70s received the 2.8 L naturally aspirated DL diesel engine with at 3600 rpm. The first model of Taft/Rocky/Hiline was built in Indonesia until 1995. File:Daihatsu Taft (rear), Jakarta.jpg1990 Daihatsu Taft GT (F70) = 1992‚Äì2002 = The second model was introduced in 1991 and became available for export the following year. The redesign, including a new dashboard, was carried out by Bertone, who also got to develop their own luxurious version to be sold in certain European markets.Kie√üler, p. 71 Among the changes was the replacement of the early leaf spring axles by independent front suspension and a coil spring rear axle. The spare tire was mounted somewhat lower, improving rear vision, and on left-hand-drive models the spare was finally moved to the right. The petrol engine (now in the F90-series) was enlarged to 2.2 L, with a small power hike to . This motorization was first shown in Europe at the September 1993 Frankfurt Auto Show and was only sold in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, the 2.8 L turbodiesel engine was now only available with an intercooler, with power remaining DIN. In the Japanese market, JIS was claimed. Still, the model was considered too rustic, still not possessing rear doors in the long wheelbase model, and Daihatsu declined to replace it, concentrating instead on their smaller automobiles after F70 production ended in 2002.

As before, there was a longer, five- door version as well as a pickup truck available in addition to the three-door models sold elsewhere. The rear-wheel drive petrol-engined version, called Feroza (not to be confused with its smaller, unrelated F300-series sibling which is never sold in Indonesia) was introduced in 1993. The post-facelift F70s with a five-door body received new bodywork from the B-pillar back, with proper wind-down windows in the rear doors. The 1.6 L petrol-engined Feroza was discontinued in 1999, then it was replaced by the more modern locally built Daihatsu Terios-based Taruna, still with the same 1.6 L HC-C petrol engine. The last Indonesian-built Taft model was made in 2007.

The first Freeclimber is a well-equipped, high-end deluxe (luxury car) off-roader produced from 1989 to 1992. In France, where only the diesel was available, the importer Chardonnet offered an even more luxurious version. Named after a perfume by Nicolas de Barry it was called \\"Blue Lagoon\\", and was available with either Alcantara or leather interior. Bertone built about 2800 Freeclimbers, of two generations. The Freeclimber II was based on the smaller F300-series Rocky/Feroza.

Early years At Downsview Secondary School, Brian Price (organ, vocals) formed his own band, the Dimensions with brothers Jay (rhythm guitar) and Ian Telfer (bass guitar), Phil Seon (guitar) and Greg Hershoff (drums) in July 1965, The Dimensions were managed by Bernie Finkelstein, (future president of True North Records and Bruce Cockburn's longstanding manager), who had also been a student at Downsview. After playing dates at many high schools across Ontario, the Dimensions became the house band at Cafe El Patio in the Yorkville Village through Finkelstein's connections. The band changed name to A Passing Fancy in January 1966 when Finkelstein left to take over the management of The Paupers. By this stage, Rick Mann (aka Fruchtman) had replaced Jay's brother on bass. The new line-up began to gig extensively on the local scene. Through the band's fan club president, Barb Young, A Passing Fancy was introduced to record storeowner Walter Honsberger and partner Dan Bartollini, who began to shape the band's sound and image as Wal-Dan Management. Within a few months, the management team had wrangled a three- single deal with Columbia Records. The first single under this deal, I'm Losin' Tonight was very successful and charted across Canada. In September 1966, Steve Wilson came in to replace Greg Hershoff on the drums. Aside from playing regularly at clubs like the Night Owl, the Gogue Inn and Club 888, A Passing Fancy also worked extensively at the Blue Fox and established a local following throughout late 1966 and early 1967. Singles success and playing Expo The band's debut single, Telfer's \\"I'm Losing Tonight\\", released in February 1967, reached No. 22 on the CHUM chart the following month. While its follow up, \\"You're Going Out Of Your Mind\\" only made No. 37 in June, the group's third single for Columbia, \\"I Believe in Sunshine\\" restored some faith by reaching No. 28 in September. By then, Steve Wilson had left and Louis Pratile joined on drums. During the summer of 1967, A Passing Fancy played at Expo '67 in Montreal where they jammed with local band, Les Tetes Blanches. The moderate success of the singles, prompted Columbia to finance a fourth single, \\"People In Me\\", was listed at No. 48 and failed to chart higher when it was released in December. Telfer's insistence on practice was resisted by Price who was completing his third year in university and wanted to pursue a career in dentistry. In March 1968, Price quit. Although Telfer was recognized as the musical leader of the group, Price was the founder and spiritual and business leader. His leaving the band had a major impact on Seon and Mann. A Passing Fancy carried on by replacing Price with Fergus Hambleton on organ and vocals and Brian Smith who contributed a third folky guitar but the chemistry of the band was never the same. After shooting at the CBC, playing the first Let's Go TV show in colour and performing that same night at the Granite club, Telfer was told by the Wal-Dan management that he would no longer be in the group. Unhappy over the new direction Seon and Mann left shortly thereafter. A few months later, in June 1968, the remaining members of the band also left. Fergus Hambleton period The Wal-Dan management decided to reform the band around Hambleton and in July 1968 brought in new members, Ron Forster (guitar), Dan Troutman (bass) and Wally Cameron (drums) and Glenn Brown (lead vocals). The new line up recorded four tracks, which the management took to John Irvine of Boo Records. Irvine helped piece together an album's worth of material and released a lone single, \\"Your Trip\\", but it sold poorly. The self-titled album, which featured all of the Columbia singles, (including an alternate mix of \\"I'm Losing Tonight\\" with no lead guitar) was released in November 1968. Like the single, the album failed to make an impression despite the band holding down a residency at the El Patio throughout the latter part of 1968 and early 1969. By June 1969, the band had broken up. Aftermath Original member and guiding light, Jay Telfer went on to perform and record as a solo artist. In the spring of 1969, he recorded an unreleased album for Bernie Finkelstein with contributions from Kensington Market members Keith McKie, John Mills Cockell and Alex Darou; Malcolm Tomlinson and Louis McKelvey from Milkwood; Murray McLauchlan and Kevin Staples, who later found fame with Rough Trade. Telfer died in May 2009. Staples also played guitar on an album that Telfer and Fergus Hambleton recorded together for Allied Records called \\"Come Together\\" as Goody Two Shoes. Telfer resumed a solo career and recorded a string of singles and a 1974 album, \\"Time Has Tied Me\\" for Axe Records in 1973-1974. On that album, Jay brought back Murray McLauchlan, Malcolm Tomlinson, Fred Mollin, Rick Mann, Fergus Hambleton and Kevin Staples. In 1975, Jay Telfer moved to LA to marry and quickly divorce Bonnie Bedelia and later became a script writer for Cannon Films, which included 1977's ', starring Jim Brown, Lee Van Cleef and Leif Garrett. In Toronto in 1979, Telfer wrote You've Come a Long Way, Katie a three-hour piece on cross-addiction for CBC. Brian Price graduated dentistry in 1972 and practiced for eight years before he founded Tridont Dental Centres in 1980. Tridont opened 107 dental offices under from coast to coast in Canada. Price challenged dentists' right to advertise their services to the public in 1988. He won a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada decision in 1990 wherein all professionals in Canada can now advertise their services. In 1990 Price left the health care industry and created Parkhurst Products Inc. a hockey card manufacturer. Currently, he owns In The Game, Inc. a sports card and memorabilia manufacturing company based in Vaughan, Ontario. Hambleton also went solo and later played with the bands Rain and The Basics and with reggae act The Sattalites. Final A Passing Fancy drummer, Wally Cameron was briefly involved with Leigh Ashford as well as lead singer Glenn Brown who also was involved with Leigh Ashford. Rick Mann changed his name back to Richard Fruchtman and played bass with Whiskey Howl, a seminal Canadian blues band, from 1970 to 1972. He then freelanced and played with Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, Paul Shaffer, Doug Henning, The Diamonds, Doug Kershaw, Dan Hill, Richard Newell (aka King Biscuit Boy), Tony Kosinec, String Band. A Passing Fancy reunited for a one-off concert date in Toronto's Yorkville village in 1988. Later Telfer became publisher and editor of the antique collector's magazine Wayback Times.

Valluvanad was an erstwhile late medieval feudal state in the present state of Kerala in South India extending from the Bharathapuzha River in the south to the Pandalur Mala in the north during their zenith in the early Middle Ages. On the west, it was bounded by the Arabian Sea at the port Ponnani and on the east by Attappadi Hills. According to local legends, the last Later Chera ruler gave a vast extension of land in South Malabar to one of their governors, Valluvakkonithiri and left for a hajj. The Valluvakkonithiri was also given last Later Chera ruler's shield (presumably to defend himself from the sword received by the Samoothiri (Zamorin) of Kozhikode, another governor, from the departing ruler). Not surprisingly, the Vellatiri rajas were hereditary enemies of the Samoothiri. Valluvanad is famous for the Mamankam festivals, held once in 12 years and the endless wars against the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. By the late 18th century, Vellatiri or Walluwanad proper was the sole remaining territory of the Walluvanad raja (Valluva Konatiri), who once exercised suzerain rights over a large portion of Southern Malabar. Although management of the country was restored to the Vellatiri raja in 1792, it soon became evident that he was powerless to repress the trouble that quickly broke out between Mapillas (favored by the Mysorean occupiers) and Nairs (who sought to restore the ancien r√©gime), and already in 1793 management of the district had to be resumed as the chief and his family fled to Travancore.  People  As of the 2011 census, the total population of the Panchayat is 32,748. The population density is 1,054 per km¬≤ which is around the state average. The sex ratio is almost normal. The people are highly literate. The literacy rate is 95.66 percent. Malayalam is the most-spoken as well as the administrative language. Cinematographer and director Mankada Ravi Varma was born here.  Economy  The economy encompasses traditional village farming, small scale business, and foreign money. A good percentage of natives are working in the Middle Eastern Countries. The local economy is currently undergoing a construction boom and which is solely dependent on the gulf money. The main crops that are cultivated are coconut, arecacnut, paddy, and banana. Two gold load zones of highly potential sulphide rich high grade rocks have been found in recent explorations in mankada. The govt may head for the mining, if it can address the environmental issues. Administration and other facilities The panchayath is divided into 18 wards for administrative ease. Development funds are coming to the village through panchayath allocations and the assembly and parliament allocations. The panchayath has a very good track record on development using the fund allocation from local governments. The road network and potable water accessibility is available to a good number of people. The panchayath has one Government Allopathic hospital, one Government-run Ayurvedic hospital and few other clinics. Other public amenities include four banks including State Bank of India, Federal Bank, Co-operative banks, one post office, public library, police station, and a stadium. Transportation Mankada village connects to other parts of India through Perinthalmanna town. National Highway No.66 passes through Tirur and the northern stretch connects to Goa and Mumbai. The southern stretch connects to Cochin and Trivandrum. Highway No.966 goes to Palakkad and Coimbatore. The nearest airport is at Kozhikode. The nearest major railway station is at [(Angadippuram)], Tirur, and Shoranur Junction.  Education  Though the literacy rate is high, most of the literacy rate was attained through the literacy drive of Kerala Literacy Mission. The panchayath has good number of primary and upper primary schools. The main educational institute is the Government Higher secondary school Mankada, Government High School Cheriyam Mankada, Al Ameen English medium School Mankada, and NCT English medium school Verumpilakkal which has thousands of students. Vigilante issues Mankada attracted the attention of national newspapers in 2016 when a 42-year-old man was beaten to death by his neighbors for visiting his girlfriend in the night.

The municipality is located in the southern portion of the state in the Baj√≠o region of central Mexico, and has an area of some . The city of Valle de Santiago lies at an elevation of in the east-central part of the municipality, approximately south of the state capital, Guanajuato. History The settlement was founded in 1607 by Pedro Mart√≠nez Rinc√≥n, Pedro Rivera, Diego Tamayo, Francisco G√≥mez, Francisco Santoyo, Silvestre de Aguirre, Luis Fonseca, Antonio Estrada, Andr√©s Cu√©llar and Juan Mart√≠nez. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 68,058 (the ninth-largest community in the state), while the municipality had a population of 141,058.  Volcanic Craters  La Alberca currently. Over 30 inactive volcanic craters are located in Valle de Santiago, but only 7 of those are recognized, and protected as they have been declared national monuments. The seven volcanic craters are known as \\"Siete Luminares\\" and include C√≠ntora, Hoyas de Santa Rosa, La Alberca, San Nicol√°s de Parangueo, Blanca, Estrada, √Ålvarez and Sol√≠s. Many of these craters naturally evolved into crater-lakes, and they would later become recreational spots. La Alberca, which translates to \\"the pool\\", was once an abundant lake that just over 40 years ago was filled with fresh water, but due to human activity has now dried up and been populated with cacti and shrubs. One of the biggest factors for the current state of these now dried crater lakes is the over extraction of groundwater for both water supply and irrigation. The government has banned groundwater extraction and they are making various efforts to conserve the condition of these seven craters and prevent further damage. Since the SIete Luminares are essential for agriculture and wildlife, there is a large amount of effort being pushed towards their preservation.

Gallery wrap is a method of stretching an artist's canvas so that the canvas wraps around the sides of the stretcher bar or strainer bars and is secured to the back of the wooden frame. Structure The frame is usually 1.25\\" (approx. 4 cm) thick. As a result, the hardware (staples or tacks) used to secure the canvas are not visible. The sides of the canvas are prepared and primed in the same manner as the face or front. They may then be painted a solid color (usually white) or painted to continue the image appearing on the face. This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frameless presentation of the finished painting or photograph. In some competitions it is considered \\"framed\\" and ready to hang. Terminology In canvas printing, the term \\"gallery wrap\\" refers to an image that appears on the sides of the frame as well as the front. The image on the sides is either a continuation or a reflection of the main image, or an otherwise fabricated element such as a solid color or colors derived from the adjacent image. Gallery wrap is a very popular way to display art. However, because the edges of the canvas are wrapped over the thick bars, approximately two inches of the image (top, bottom, and sides) are not visible from the front. If the subject of an image or painting is sized and positioned correctly, the image will not be negatively affected. However, in some situations photo editing techniques are employed to fabricate additional image/material or to mirror existing content on the wrapped edges. Solid colours can also be used on the wrapped edges. Gallery wrap production can be digitally automated with a Photoshop plugin or raster graphics editor. Painting on a gallery-wrapped canvas Gallery wrap versus non-gallery wrap Gallery wrap is a method of displaying art wrapped over thick wooden bars so that there are no visible fasteners (such as staples or tacks). This method of stretching and preparing a canvas allows for a frame-less presentation of the finished painting. In contrast, a non-gallery wrap canvas is usually intended to be framed before presentation. The stretcher bars are often thinner, and the canvas can be secured at the sides with staples or tacks as the frame will hide them. However, thin stretcher bars can be found \\"gallery wrapped\\" as a hangable work without a frame.  Quality  A good gallery wrap consists of the following qualities: * Tight Stretch: Good gallery wraps are stretched tightly over the stretcher bars to maintain a flat, unaltered image. On canvases that are not tightly stretched, waves or bumpy areas, especially on areas around the stretcher bars, can be seen and felt. * Hand Stretched: Hand stretched canvases are the best option because this reduces the possibility of over-stretching. Machines may over stretch the image, causing rips or breaks in the ink of the image. Hand stretched canvases also allow for humans to align the image in a more visually appealing way, being sure not to cut off any parts of the main image which a machine would not be able to detect. * Clean Staples: On the back of the canvas, good gallery wraps are stapled cleanly and securely. * Clean Folds: Good gallery wraps have clean folds on the edges. You can see the nice folds on the corners that show they are hand stretched, but no extra pieces of canvas are sticking out or causing extra lumps under the image. * Solid Wood Stretcher Bars: Good quality wraps should have a good foundations. Solid wood stretcher bars provide a good base for stretching and keep the canvas from bowing or bending over time.

History Republic Airlines began in 1979 with the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways, the first under airline deregulation. The new airline's headquarters were at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, though their largest hub was at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. Following their buyout of Hughes Airwest in 1980, Republic became the largest airline in the U.S. by number of airports served. The company operated the world's largest Douglas DC-9 fleet, with DC-9-10, DC-9-30 and DC-9-50s and also flew Boeing 727-200, Boeing 757-200, and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets. In addition, Republic operated Convair 580 turboprops previously flown by North Central. After the merger, losses mounted and service reductions followed. Saddled with debt from two acquisitions and new aircraft, the airline struggled in the early 1980s, and even introduced a human mascot version of Herman the Duck. They reduced service to Phoenix, a former hub of Hughes Airwest, citing their inability to compete with non-union airlines there and eventually dismantled the former extensive route system operated by Hughes Airwest in the western U.S.http://www.departedflights.com, September 1, 1980 Hughes Airwest system route map and March 2, 1986 Republic Airlines system route map Republic Frequent Flyer Program In October 1984 Republic introduced a new frequent flyer program called the Republic Frequent Flyer Program. The new program eliminated the need to place a frequent flyer account number sticker on each flight ticket coupon, with earned mileage automatically being assigned to accounts if the reservation was booked directly with Republic. Each flight segment earned a minimum of 1,000 miles or the actual mileage, if greater. A domestic round trip reward ticket was automatically issued every 20,000 miles. The new program included a partnership with Pan American World Airways for earning and redeeming mileage awards. In January 1986, Western Airlines was added as a partner. Effective October 1, 1986, the Republic Frequent Flyer Flyer was merged into the new Northwest Airlines WorldPerks program. =Northwest Airlines= In 1986, Northwest Orient Airlines announced on January 23 that they would buy Republic for $884 million in response to United Airlines' purchase of the Pacific routes of Pan American World Airways and to provide domestic feed. Opposed by the Justice Department, the Northwest-Republic merger was approved by the Transportation Department on July 31 and was completed on October 1, with Northwest dropping the word Orient from their name after the merger. Republic's hubs at Minneapolis, Memphis, and Detroit became the backbone of Northwest's domestic network. Northwest later merged with Delta Air Lines in 2008; the deal was finalized in January 2010, with Delta as the surviving air carrier. Republic's hubs in Detroit and the Twin Cities have remained intact with Delta; Memphis was dehubbed in 2013.

He was convicted and executed for murder in 1913 after a sensational courthouse shootout the previous year that left a judge, prosecutor, sheriff, and two others dead, although the validity of the conviction has been source of debate within Carroll County for decades. Allen, who was before the bar for sentencing after being convicted of taking a prisoner from a deputy sheriff, allegedly triggered the shooting at the Carroll County Courthouse in Hillsville on March 14, 1912. Early life and activities Floyd Allen was born in 1856 and spent much of his life living in Cana, Virginia, located below Fancy Gap Mountain in Carroll County. He was the patriarch of the county's most prominent family, which, in addition to owning large tracts of farmland and a prosperous general store, were also active in local politics as proud Southern Democrats.Meloney, William B., The Man From Down Yonder, Everybody's Magazine, Vol. 26, January- June 1912, pp. 783-784 Both Allen and his brother Sidna held legal licenses for the production of alcohol. Allen was noted for his generosity, but also his quick temper and easily injured pride.Caudill, Harry M., Slender Is The Thread: Tales From A Country Law Office, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press (1987), , 081310811X, pp. 78-79: Attorney W.A. Daugherty remembered Floyd Allen as a man of sterling character in the matter of personal honesty, but who could not abide a personal affront: [Floyd] \\"would kill you in a second over some little matter most people wouldn't remember two minutes.\\" He had a history of violent altercations, including shooting a black man in North Carolina, beating a police officer in Mount Airy and later shooting his own cousin. In May 1889, Floyd's brothers, Garland and Sidna Allen, were tried for carrying concealed pistols and assaulting a group of thirteen men.Hall, Randall, A Courtroom Massacre: Politics And Public Sentiment In Progressive- era Virginia, Journal of Southern History 70, 1 May 2004, pp. 249-‚Äì252 In July 1889, the Carroll County court indicted Floyd for assault as well, but in December of that year the Commonwealth's Attorney dropped the case.Hall, Randall, pp. 249‚Äì252 In September 1889, after pleading no contest to the assault, Garland and Sidna were fined $5 each plus court costs, and the prosecutor dropped the weapons charges. Judge Robert C. Jackson, an attorney in Roanoke and Judge Thornton Massie's predecessor in the Carroll County courtroom, stated that, \\"Floyd Allen was perhaps the worst man of the clan overbearing, vindictive, high tempered, brutal, with no respect for law and little or no regard for human life. During my term of office Floyd Allen was several times charged with violations of law. In several instances he escaped indictment, I am satisfied, because the witnesses were afraid to testify to the facts before the grand jury.\\" Judge Jackson recalled a trial in 1904 in which Allen was convicted of assaulting a neighbor, Noah Combs. Floyd had wanted to buy a farm owned by one of his own brothers, but could not agree on a price. Combs wanted the land badly enough to pay the asking price and bought it despite Floyd Allen's warnings not to \\"butt in.\\" Not long afterward, Allen shot and wounded Combs, and was indicted and tried on charges of assault. Sentenced by the jury to an hour in jail and a $100 fine, plus costs, Allen immediately posted bail pending an appeal. His defense team included former Commonwealth's Attorney Walter Tipton and recent County Court Judge Oglesby. At the next term of court, Allen produced an order of clemency from Governor Andrew J. Montague suspending the jail sentence. In another instance, while arguing over the administration of their father's estate, Allen got into a gunfight with his own brother, Jasper, known as \\"Jack\\", a local constable. In a fusillade of shots, Allen hit Jack in the head, which struck a glancing blow on Jack's scalp, while one of Jack's bullets hit Allen in the chest. His pistol empty, Allen proceeded to beat Jack with the butt of his empty revolver. Sentenced to a $100 fine and one hour in jail for wounding Jack, Floyd refused to go, saying that he \\"would never spend a minute in jail as long as the blood flowed through his veins\\". Floyd's body bore the scars of thirteen bullet wounds, five of them inflicted in quarrels with his own family.Allens Executed; Respite Plan Failed, The New York Times, 29 March 1913. Despite their history of violence, the Allens held considerable political power, and Allen had a reputation for courage.Caudill, Harry M., Slender Is The Thread: Tales From A Country Law Office, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press (1987), , 081310811X, p. 74 In 1908, while serving as special deputies, Allen and a relative, Henry \\"H.C.\\" Allen, were charged with unlawful assault upon prisoners held in their custody whom they claimed had resisted arrest.Communication From The Governor Of Virginia: List Of Pardons, Commutations, Respites, And Remissions Of Fines, And Reasons Therefor, Senate Document No. V, Journal of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Richmond, VA 12 January 1910, p. 66 On February 1, 1908, the Allens were convicted of the charge and sentenced to ten days in jail and a fine of $10.Communication From The Governor Of Virginia, p. 66 Only a month later, their petition for executive clemency was granted by Governor Claude A. Swanson, restoring their political rights to hold office. In 1910, Sidna Allen was tried in the United States court at Greensboro, North Carolina for making twenty-dollar counterfeit coins. The federal court in Greensboro found him not guilty, while Sidna's alleged accomplice, Preston Dickens, was found guilty and sentenced to serve five years in federal prison. Sidna was retried and found guilty of perjury in his trial testimony, and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.Meloney, William B., The Man From Down Yonder, p. 783-784 Sidna promptly appealed and won a new trial on the perjury charge. The next year, after the Allens complained that they could not expect justice from William Foster, the Republican Commonwealth Attorney of the county (who had recently switched parties), Judge Thornton L. Massie appointed both Floyd and H.C. as police officers for the New River section of the county.Caudill, Harry M., Slender Is The Thread, p. 74Hines, Emilee, It Happened In Virginia, Globe Pequot Press (2001), , p. 84 However, times were changing: Virginia's judicial structure was altered in a series of legal reforms, particularly the county court system, which was replaced by circuit courts. The new system appointed a full-time judge to hold court at scheduled intervals in a circuit of several counties. While the state legislature still appointed circuit judges, the new system reduced the ability of individual delegates to ensure that their preferred judge was selected for their particular county; furthermore, judges could no longer practice law for private clients while on the bench, and as regional judges their susceptibility to local influence and public opinion was reduced. Arrest of the Edwards brothers One night in December 1910 (some sources say 1911), two of Floyd Allen's nephews, Wesley and Sidna Edwards, attended a corn shucking bee in Hillsville. While there, Wesley kissed a girl who was romantically linked to a local youth, Will Thomas, which led to an altercation between the two young men. At a church service the next morning conducted by Wesley's uncle, Garland Allen, Thomas reportedly called out Wesley into a fight. According to Wesley, Thomas and three friends assaulted him, and he defended himself with the help of his brother Sidna, who rushed to join the fight. Wesley and Sidna were charged with disorderly conduct, assault with a deadly weapon, disturbing a public worship service, and other violations.Last Of Allen Clan Is Killed, The New York Times, 19 March 1916 Rather than face arrest, the two men fled over the state line to North Carolina, where they found jobs in a granite quarry. The deputy clerk of Carroll County, Dexter Goad, obtained a new warrant for the brothers' arrest, notifying the sheriff in Surry County, North Carolina, who soon arrested both men. A Carroll County deputy sheriff, Thomas Samuels, and his driver, Peter Easter, traveled in Easter's four-seater buggy to the state line and received the brothers from Sheriff Haynes and Deputy Oscar Monday, who had arrested the brothers at work.Hall, Randall, A Courtroom Massacre: Politics and Public Sentiment in Progressive-Era Virginia, Journal of Southern History 70 (May 2004), pp. 249‚Äì292 There was only one set of handcuffs, and because Sidna Edwards had tried to escape a couple of times, Wesley was handcuffed in the front seat of the buggy and Sidna was tied in the back seat. On the way to the courthouse, the buggy passed by several properties owned by the Allens. Floyd Allen met the buggy south of Sidna Allen's home as he was on the way to his own home. Deputy Samuels pulled a gun (later determined to be inoperative) and ordered Floyd to move away, and Floyd rode back past the buggy to Sidna's store where he then blocked the narrow road with his mare. Samuels again pulled his gun on Floyd. A fight ensued and Floyd beat Samuels with his own pistol. Wesley Edwards tried to grapple with Easter, but Easter got away and fired a shot at Floyd as he did so, wounding Floyd in the finger. Floyd then released the Edwards brothers. Easter ran to an acquaintance's home, and he telephoned the sheriff at Hillsville. Deputy Samuels was left lying unconscious in a ditch, and his horses were run off.Meloney, William B., The Man From Down Yonder, p. 783-784 Floyd Allen later stated that he never intended to have the boys set completely free, he just wanted them to be released from their manacles. On the following Monday, Wesley and Sidna Edwards were turned over to the court by Floyd Allen, and the two Edwards brothers were soon tried and convicted of their crimes. Wesley was sentenced to sixty days and his brother thirty, which were served outside jail on work- release. Indictment The Commonwealth's attorney, William Foster had served as Carroll County's prosecutor for eight years, having been first elected on the Democratic ticket. Later, Foster changed to the Republican party, and by 1912 was a prominent leader in the GOP in Carroll County, being elected the last time on the Republican ticket. Foster was a political enemy of the Allens, who had supported Jack Allen's son, Walter, as Democratic candidate for Commonwealth's Attorney against Foster in the last election. (Walter Allen had lost the bitterly fought race.)Meloney, William B., The Man From Down Yonder, Everybody's Magazine, Vol. 26, January‚ÄìJune 1912, p. 783-784: In the aftermath of the race, Floyd Allen claimed he had been told that Foster had said the whole Allen clan \\"ought to be killed\\", an allegation Foster denied. Allen told Foster he couldn't prove Foster made the statement, \\"but if it could, I'd blow your brains out where you stand.\\" Foster called upon a grand jury to investigate the escape/pistol-whipping incident. Floyd Allen agreed to testify and admitted 'roughing up' Samuels, but denied intending to release the prisoners: \\"That there Samuel[s] was abusing the boys. He had them handcuffed and tied up with a rope. I just can't bear to see anyone drug around.\\" Nonetheless, the grand jury indicted Floyd Allen, Sidna Allen and Barnett Allen for interfering with the deputies, and Floyd Allen was also indicted for assault and battery upon Samuels. Sidna Allen was never tried for his part in the altercation, while Barnett Allen was acquitted at trial. When Floyd Allen's case was set for trial, rumors arose that he had sent word to Deputy Samuels that he would kill Samuels if the deputy testified against him. Allen later denied this, but the reported threat caused Samuels to leave the state the same night it was delivered.Meloney, William B., The Man From Down Yonder, Everybody's Magazine, Vol. 26, January‚ÄìJune 1912, p. 788 The rumor that the Allens were intimidating witnesses was called to the attention of the court. Judge Thornton L. Massie called Constable Jack Allen (and Floyd Allen, who had been deputized by Massie about six months earlier) to the bar and proceeded to question them about the alleged intimidation. Jack Allen denied all responsibility for the allegations of intimidation, which he stated were untrue and insisted neither he nor his brother was guilty of wrongdoing. In response, the judge told the two men that if the law could not be faithfully enforced in Carroll County by the county's deputized officers he would bring in state troops if necessary to maintain order. A witness later testified that Floyd Allen had remarked that he \\"would not let any man talk to me that way.\\"Allen Boys Tell of Shooting, The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, 11 May 1912 Trial and shooting After close to a year of delays, Floyd was finally brought to trial on March 13, 1912.Wiley, Edwin. The Allens of Fancy Gap. Lulu Press, 2011, p. 228. Judge Thornton L. Massie, who had deputized Floyd six months earlier, presided. Floyd Allen was well represented by a two-attorney team. Both Walter Scott Tipton and David Winton Bolen, were retired Carroll County judges. Samuels' departure forced Commonwealth's Attorney William M. Foster to rely on testimony from Deputy Easter. The jury could not agree on a verdict immediately as the trial ended, and were sequestered in a local hotel overnight. Fearful of the Allens' reaction, and having received death threats, many officials of the court armed themselves. At least two of the participants, Judge Massie and Sheriff Webb, had told friends that they expected trouble. Many of Allen clan members were spectators in the courtroom, most of them armed with pistols. Sidna Allen and Claud Allen stood on benches in the courtroom's northeast corner to see over the crowd. Friel Allen sat in the back of the room, and the Edwards boys stood on benches next to the north wall. When the jury returned a guilty verdict against with a sentence of one year in the penitentiary, Floyd Allen is reported to have said to Judge Massie: \\"If you sentence me on that verdict, I will kill you.\\"\\"Judge T.L. Massie and Two Court Officers Murdered By Allen Gang at Hillsville\\", The Roanoke Times, 15 March 1912 The judge immediately sentenced Floyd Allen to one year's imprisonment. According to Floyd Allen's defense attorney, David Winton Bolen, \\"[Floyd] hesitated a moment, and then he arose...He looked to me like a man who was about to say something, and had hardly made up his mind what he was going to say, but as he got straight, he moved off to my left, I would say five or six feet, and he seemed to gain his speech, and he said something like this, 'I just tell you, I ain't a'going.'\\"\\"One Caught; Allen Gang Will Give Up\\", The New York Times, 23 March 1912: In contrast to Attorney Bolen's version of Floyd's reaction to the sentence, Sidna Edwards stated that his uncle Floyd \\"jumped up\\" after hearing the sentence, and appeared considerably agitated. At this point, shots broke out in the courtroom. Accounts differ as to who actually fired the first shot. Many accounts claim that Allen initiated the confrontation by pulling a gun in court. In his defense testimony, Floyd Allen stated that Sheriff Lew F. Webb fired first, but that the shot missed Allen, at which point Deputy Clerk Goad, the Clerk of Court, fired and hit Allen, causing him to fall. (When Floyd fell, wounded, he landed on top of his lawyer David Bolen, who had ducked to the ground as soon as the shooting started, and who is reported to have said, \\"Floyd, they are going to kill me shooting at you!\\") Floyd Allen stated that only then did he draw his own revolver and begin shooting. After a fusillade of shots, the Allen clan left the courthouse, armed with both pistols and 12-gauge pump shotguns, and shooting as they ran. Judge Massie, Sheriff Webb, Commonwealth's Attorney Foster, and the jury foreman (Augustus C. Fowler), were all hit and died of their wounds sustained in the crossfire. More than fifty bullets were later recovered from the shooting scene. Elizabeth Ayers, a 19-year-old subpoenaed witness who had testified against Floyd Allen, was shot in the back while trying to leave the courtroom, and died at home the next day.\\"Floyd Allen Defense Gets Well Into Case\\", Bluefield, W. Va.: The Bluefield Telegraph, 9 May 1912: Solomon Ayers, a cousin of Elizabeth Ayers, testified that Elizabeth was shot through the back above the waistline and the bullet ranged upward and exited her right breast. Seven others were wounded, including Deputy Clerk Goad and Floyd Allen. Floyd, wounded too badly in the hip, thigh and knee to leave town, instead spent the night in the Elliott Hotel accompanied by his eldest son, Victor, who was later acquitted of involvement in the shootout. Upon his arrest by deputies at the hotel, Floyd attempted to slash his own throat with a pocketknife, but was overpowered before he could complete the job.\\"Two More Dead in Allen Feud\\", The New York Times, 16 March 1912 Manhunt Virginia law held that when a sheriff died his deputies lost all legal powers, so the shooting left Carroll County without law enforcement by the shooting. Recognizing the need for immediate action, assistant clerk S. Floyd Landreth sent a telegram to Democratic Governor William Hodges Mann which read: > Send troops to the County of Carroll at once. Mob violence, the court. > Commonwealth's Attorney, Sheriff, some jurors and others shot on the > conviction of Floyd Allen for a felony. Sheriff and Commonwealth's Attorney > dead, court serious. Look after this now. Governor Mann immediately called on the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency to find those responsible for the shootings and arrest them. The Commonwealth of Virginia posted rewards ($1000 for Sidna Allen, $1000 for Sidna Edwards, $800 for Claud Allen, $500 for Friel Allen, and $500 for Wesley Edwards) - dead or alive.\\"One Caught; Allen Gang Will Give Up\\", The New York Times, 23 March 1912 Within a month, all suspected shooters were in custody, except Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards. During the initial manhunt, several posses of detectives and local deputies searched the surrounding countryside. Friel Allen gave himself up to detectives in the company of his father, Jack Allen, who worried his son might be killed while being apprehended. Cousins Claud Allen and Sidna Edwards were soon arrested after a brief search. The U.S. Revenue Service had sent Deputy Agent Faddis to investigate reports of illegal liquor trafficking by the Allens.\\"Posse On Night Ride To Surround Allens\\", The New York Times, 20 March 1912 Agent Faddis and four men raided Floyd Allen's property, seizing illegal stills and fifty gallons of moonshine. Two more illegal stills were found at Sidna Edwards' house. However, Sidna Allen and his nephew, Wesley Edwards, fled Virginia. After several months' chase, Baldwin-Felts detectives located them in Iowa after an informant's tip. Sidna Allen maintained until the end of his life that this informant was Maude Iroller, Wesley's fiancee, who provided information on the fugitives' location in exchange for $500 from the detective agency. Others state that Miss Iroller's father, who had never approved of his daughter's romance with Wesley Edwards, tipped off the detectives that Maude was going to Des Moines to marry him. Baldwin-Felts detectives traveled to Des Moines, arrested the suspects, and returned them to Carroll County to stand trial. Trials for the courthouse shooting Floyd Allen was the first to be brought to trial on a charge of murdering Judge Massie, Sheriff Webb, and Commonwealth's Attorney Foster. Judge W. R. Staples presided over the courthouse shooting trials, which were prosecuted by Assistant Attorney General Samuel W. Williams and involved attorneys Draper, Landreth, Poage and Wysor. No autopsies were ever performed and rumors flew of friendly fire casualties. The prosecutor's case was based on the formation of a conspiracy by the Allens to kill the trial judge, local law enforcement, and others who had wronged them in the event of a guilty verdict. J. E. Kearn, a traveling salesman from Roanoke, testified he sold Sidna Allen a lot of ammunition at the March term of the Hillsville court, specifically 500 each of .32 and .38 caliber pistol cartridges and 500 12-gauge shotgun shells.\\"Accuses Dexter Goad Of Shooting Betty Ayers\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia: 20 November 1912 The prosecution attempted to show that Floyd and Claud Allen prompted the gun battle by standing and pulling their pistols and opening fire. Former judge David Winton Bolen, who had been present during the shooting as one of Floyd Allen's defense attorneys, was the first witness the prosecution called at Floyd Allen's murder trial. Bolen had been standing next to Floyd Allen, and was facing Judge Massie when the first shots struck the judge's robes. Bolen testified that Claud Allen fired the first shot, and that Claud Allen's pistol shot, together with a second shot fired by Sidna Allen, killed Judge Massie.\\"Claude Allen First To Fire At Hillsville\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 3 May 1912 Another prosecution witness was Floyd Allen's other attorney, Walter S. Tipton. Tipton testified he saw Claud Allen in the courthouse with a pistol raised in both hands as if he had just fired it. During a second glance Tipton again saw Floyd with his pistol raised and held in both hands; he then saw Floyd Allen fire his pistol.\\"Saw Allen In Act Of Firing\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 28 May 1912 Yet another lawyer who witnessed the shooting, W. A. Daugherty of Pikeville, stated that several young men were standing on court benches at the back of the room firing their pistols \\"like Custer's cavalrymen at the Little Big Horn\\".Caudill, Harry M., Slender Is The Thread: Tales From A Country Law Office, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press (1987), , 081310811X, p. 78 Deputy Sheriff George W. Edwards, who became the sheriff of Carroll County after Sheriff Webb's death, testified that, as a deputy sheriff at the time, he had spoken with Floyd Allen just after Allen learned of his indictment. Floyd said that Commonwealth's Attorney Foster would not give him a show; but that if he did not there would be a \\"big hole put in the court house.\\" The next witness was Sidney Towe, who largely corroborated the testimony of Sheriff Edwards. On a different occasion, he heard Floyd Allen make the same threat of putting the biggest hole in the courthouse that any man ever had seen.\\"Prosecution Tries To Show A Conspiracy\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 4 May 1912 On the other hand, Floyd Allen and his relatives claimed Deputy Clerk Dexter Goad had fired first, prompted by a long-standing vendetta he and Foster held against the Allen family. The defense attempted to show that Deputy Clerk Goad shot Elizabeth Ayers in his exchange of fire with the Allens, a charge Goad denied.\\"Accuses Dexter Goad of Shooting Betty Ayers\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 20 November 1912 Years later, an allegation surfaced that Deputy Clerk H.C. Quesinberry had confessed on his deathbed to starting the shooting; two men swore an affidavit to that effect in 1967 (for which each man was reportedly paid $25). Others consider the alleged affidavit to be hearsay, made years after the event transpired, and worthless. In his testimony at his murder trial, Floyd Allen admitted he had fired at Deputy Clerk Quesinberry and again twice more at other unknown persons once he had left the courthouse.\\"Sheriff Fired First, Says Floyd Allen\\", The New York Times, 12 May 1912 Deputy Clerk Dexter Goad admitted firing the second shot at Floyd, striking him in the pelvis. He said he thought Floyd's fumbling with his sweater buttons was a prelude to drawing his pistol. However, Goad denied firing the first shot in the fusillade. Though wounded by four bullets himself, Goad recovered. S. E. Gardner, a Hillsville undertaker who prepared the body of Sheriff Webb for burial, testified that the Sheriff was shot no less than five times. One bullet entered the back and ranged upward, lodging directly under the collarbone. A second shot entered the back about four inches lower, while a third shot cut the sheriff across the chin. Another entered the body at the cap of the left hip and passed through the abdomen. The last and fifth shot went into the calf of the leg and when his trousers were removed, a .32 caliber bullet was discovered. Attorney Howard C. Gilmer, of Pulaski, Virginia, was at Hillsville Courthouse in a room adjoining Judge Massie's courtroom when the shooting broke out. Gilmer testified he heard two shots in quick succession, after which there was a slight interval and then a great volley of firing. He also testified that he saw the crowd come out of the court house, and recognized Floyd and Sidna Allen as the last to leave, both of them following and firing as they backed out, apparently in response to fire coming from within the courthouse. The last two bullets were fired by Floyd and went through two of the steps of one of the courthouse's stairways, where they can still be viewed today. Gilmer said he heard Floyd Allen say two or three times, \\"I am shot, but I got the damn scoundrel.\\" County Treasurer J. B. Marshall testified that when the shooting started he turned to escape the courthouse. After getting down the steps he leaned against the window of his office when two girls, Dora and Elizabeth Ayers, passed him.\\"Floyd Allen Defense Gets Well Into Case\\", Bluefield, West Virginia: The Bluefield Telegraph, 9 May 1912 He testified that one of the girls pointed out some of the Allens leaving the courthouse, when Sidna Allen came toward him, pointed his pistol at him, and fired. Marshall then related that Sidna Allen's bullet buried itself in the window about six inches above his head. Marshall also testified he had been standing near Sheriff Webb, but did not see any pistol in the Sheriff's hand. Another witness, Walter Petty, also testified that the first shots were fired from the courtroom's northeast corner, where Claud Allen was standing. Petty also witnessed a pistol duel between Sidna Allen and Deputy Clerk Dexter Goad.\\"Defense Continues Efforts To Disprove Conspiracy\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 10 May 1912 At Claud Allen's trial for the murder of Commonwealth's Attorney Foster, Judge David W. Bolen was again the prosecution's star witness. Judge Bolen confirmed his prior testimony that he saw Claud Allen fire the first shot at Judge Massie from the courtroom's northeast corner, whereupon Claud advanced toward the court officers to where Commonwealth's Attorney Foster was standing.\\"Saw Claude Allen Fire First At Judge Massie\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 4 July 1912 For his part, Claud Allen admitted to firing his pistol while in the courtroom.\\"Allen Boys Tell of Shooting\\", Bluefield, West Virginia: The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, 11 May 1912 Claud testified that he saw Sidna Allen firing just about the time he saw Deputy Clerk Goad fire. Victor Allen, whose pistol was used in the courthouse shooting, said he saw Wesley Edwards from outside the courtroom firing a revolver through the courthouse window and over spectators' heads just after the shooting began, and later saw Edwards run from the courthouse together with Sidna Allen. Victor Allen also asserted that Claud had taken Victor's handgun as the two left their hotel in Hillsville on that morning. Sidna Edwards testified that he was not armed on the day of the shooting and that he did not like to carry guns.\\"One Caught; Allen Gang Will Give Up\\", The New York Times, 23 March 1912: Edward's uncle, Jasper (\\"Jack\\") Allen, insisted that Sidna Edwards was afraid of guns. He denied firing a gun during the courthouse shootings, and stated that he did not see who fired the first shot, but thought that it came from the vicinity of Deputy Clerk Goad's desk. Sidna Edwards had scalded his foot some years before and was partially lame, and limped out of the courthouse, riding his mother's horse back to his home. Sidna Allen denied that he shot Judge Massie, or that he fired at Commonwealth's Attorney Foster, Sheriff Webb, or at Juror Fowler.\\"State Closes Case In Sidna Allen Trial\\", The Bluefield Daily Telegraph, Bluefield, West Virginia, 7 December 1912 Allen claimed that when the shooting began, he drew his own revolver and fired five times at Deputy Clerk Goad and Deputy Sheriff Gillespie, because both men were firing at him. After those five shots, he dropped to his knees and reloaded his revolver. Sidna Allen claimed that when he left the courthouse, Goad followed behind him, shooting him through the left arm, the bullet lodging in his left side. He stated that he fired back at Goad on the courthouse steps, but denied shooting at Treasurer J. B. Marshall. He also said he went to Blankenship's Livery Stable after the incident, where he met other family members and left Hillsville with Claud Allen, Wesley Edwards, and Sidna Edwards. They returned to their homes by traveling cross- country through the farm fields rather than public roads. Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards then left Virginia, eventually reaching Des Moines, Iowa. Aftermath Floyd Allen was tried for the first-degree murder of Commonwealth's Attorney Foster. On May 18, 1912, the jury found Floyd Allen guilty. He wept freely as the verdict was read.\\"Floyd Allen Must Die\\", Beckley, W. Va: The Raleigh Herald, 24 May 1912 In July 1912, after three separate trials, Claud Allen was convicted of first-degree murder for the killing of Commonwealth's Attorney Foster, and for second-degree murder for the killing of Judge Massie.\\"Claude Allen Convicted: He Is Found Guilty of Murdering Commonwealth's Attorney Foster\\", The New York Times, 28 July 1912 For their roles in the shooting, Floyd and Claud were sentenced to death by electrocution.\\"Floyd Allen Must Pay Death Penalty\\", The New York Times, 18 May 1912 Allen's death sentence was deeply unpopular with Allen supporters in the county, but many other residents were unsympathetic, surprised by the deaths of so many people over Floyd Allen's refusal to serve a year in prison. Governor Mann, who had received death threats in the same handwriting as the threats previously delivered to the trial judge, had to cut short a trip to Pennsylvania after learning his Lieutenant Governor, James Taylor Ellyson (1847‚Äì1919), had attempted to commute the Allens' sentences in his absence, instigating a brief constitutional power struggle between the two men. Governor Mann refused a request to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment, and Floyd Allen was electrocuted on March 28, 1913 at 1:20PM. Eleven minutes later, his son Claud followed his father to death in the electric chair. Sidna Allen pleaded guilty and received a total of 35 years in prison for the voluntary manslaughter of Commonwealth's Attorney Foster, and for second-degree murder of Judge Massie. He also pleaded guilty to second- degree murder for the shooting of Sheriff Webb, and was sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment. Wesley Edwards drew nine years for each count of murder for the slaying of Foster, Massie, and Webb for a total of 27 years' imprisonment. Sidna Edwards pleaded guilty in August 1912 to second-degree murder, and was sentenced to 15 years in the penitentiary. Friel Allen was tried in August 1912 and after confessing to shooting prosecutor Foster, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Democratic Governor Elbert Lee Trinkle pardoned Friel Allen and Sidna Edwards in 1922. In April 1926, Governor Harry Flood Byrd pardoned Sidna Allen and Wesley Edwards. Victor Allen and Barnett Allen were acquitted. Burden \\"Byrd\\" Marion, a cousin and neighbor, had all charges against him dropped. Accounts differ as to whether this was for a lack of evidence, or because Marion became a state's witness and admitted his role in aiding the Allens.'\\"Last Of Allen Clan Is Killed\\", The New York Times, 19 March 1916Colby, Frank M. (ed.), North Carolina: Politics and Government, The New International Yearbook, New York: Dodd, Mead & Co. (1917), p. 495 Shortly after the Allen trials, law enforcement officers found a still in an old house on Burden Marion's farm, and he was arrested for making illegal liquor. He was tried in federal court, found guilty, and sentenced to a year in federal prison at Moundsville, West Virginia. He began his sentence in August 1913, and died of pneumonia in prison on November 25, 1913.Some sources claim that Burden Marion was found beaten to death in his cell. The Carroll County prosecutor placed liens on all property owned by Floyd Allen and Sidna Allen for the heirs of the victims. After three wrongful death lawsuits by the victims' estates and survivors, that property was confiscated and sold at auction, forcing Sidna Allen's wife and two small daughters to live in rented quarters and work at menial jobs until Sidna's eventual pardon. Floyd Allen's son, Victor, bought his father's house so his mother would not have to move. In 1921, however, Victor moved his family to Tabernacle Township, New Jersey. Jack Allen lost his job as constable as a result of the Hillsville shooting, and soon his life. On March 17, 1916, he stopped for the night in a roadhouse near Mt. Airy, North Carolina where he encountered Will McGraw, a moonshine hauler.Information Annual 1916, New York: Cumulative Digest Corp. (1917), p. 6Little Creek: Local News, Clinch Valley News, 24 March 1916 A dispute arose between McGraw and Jack Allen about the Hillsville tragedy; during the confrontation McGraw drew a gun and shot Allen twice, killing him on the spot. Jack Allen was buried near his home in Carroll County, in the presence of a thousand mourners.

It is thought to be caused by a disordered metabolism of fatty acids by mitochondria in the mother, caused by long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. The condition was previously thought to be universally fatal, but aggressive treatment by stabilizing the mother with intravenous fluids and blood products in anticipation of early delivery has improved prognosis. Signs and symptoms Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (or hepatic lipidosis of pregnancy) usually manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy, but may occur any time in the second half of pregnancy, or in the puerperium, the period immediately after delivery. On average, the disease presents during the 35th or 36th week of pregnancy. The usual symptoms in the mother are non-specific including nausea, vomiting, anorexia (or lack of desire to eat) and abdominal pain; excessive thirst may be the earliest symptom without overlap with otherwise considered normal pregnancy symptoms; however, jaundice and fever may occur in as many as 70% of patients. In patients with more severe disease, pre-eclampsia may occur, which involves elevation of blood pressure and accumulation of fluid (termed oedema). This may progress to involvement of additional systems, including acute kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and pancreatitis. There have also been reports of diabetes insipidus complicating this condition. Many laboratory abnormalities are seen in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Liver enzymes are elevated, with the AST and ALT enzymes ranging from minimal elevation to 1000 IU/L, but usually staying in the 300-500 range. Bilirubin is almost universally elevated. Alkaline phosphatase is often elevated in pregnancy due to production from the placenta, but may be additionally elevated. Other abnormalities may include an elevated white blood cell count, hypoglycemia, elevated coagulation parameters, including the international normalized ratio, and decreased fibrinogen. Frank disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC, may occur in as many as 70% of people. Abdominal ultrasound may show fat deposition in the liver, but, as the hallmark of this condition is microvesicular steatosis (see pathology below), this is not seen on ultrasound. Rarely, the condition can be complicated by rupture or necrosis of the liver, which may be identified by ultrasound. Pathophysiology Schematic demonstrating mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation and effects of LCHAD deficiency, a hallmark of acute fatty liver of pregnancy The understanding of the causes of acute fatty liver of pregnancy has been improved by advances in mitochondrial biochemistry. Deficiency of LCHAD (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) leads to an accumulation of medium and long chain fatty acids. When this occurs in the foetus, the unmetabolized fatty acids will re-enter the maternal circulation through the placenta, and overwhelm the beta-oxidation enzymes of the mother. The gene responsible for LCHAD has been isolated, and the most common mutation found in acute fatty liver of pregnancy is the E474Q missense mutation. LCHAD deficiency is autosomal recessive in inheritance and mothers are often found to be heterozygous for the affected mutation. Diagnosis The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is usually made on clinical grounds by the treating physician or midwife, but differentiation from other conditions affecting the liver may be difficult. The diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy is suggested by jaundice with a lesser elevation of liver enzymes, elevated white blood cell count, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and a clinically unwell patient. A liver biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis, but is not always done, due to the increased chance of bleeding in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Often testing will be done to exclude more common conditions that present in a similar fashion, including viral hepatitis, pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, and autoimmune hepatitis. =Pathology= If a liver biopsy is needed for diagnosis of the condition, the mother should be appropriately stabilized and treated to reduce bleeding related complications. The diagnosis can be made by a frozen-section (as opposed to a specimen in formalin) that is stained with the Oil red O stain, that shows microvesicular steatosis (or small collections of fat within the liver cells). The microvesicular steatosis usually spares zone one of the liver, which is the area closest to the hepatic artery. On the regular trichrome stain, the liver cell cytoplasm shows a foamy appearance due to the prominence of fat. Necrosis is rarely seen. The diagnosis can be enhanced by electron microscopy which can be used to confirm the presence of microvesicular steatosis, and specifically the presence of megamitochondria and paracrystalline inclusions. Liver diseases with similar appearances include Reye's syndrome, drug-induced hepatitis from agents with mitochondrial toxicity, including nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to treat HIV, and a rare condition known as Jamaican vomiting sickness which is caused by the eating of the unripened Ackee fruit. Treatment Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is best treated in a centre with expertise in hepatology, high-risk obstetrics, maternal-fetal medicine and neonatology. The physicians who treat this condition will often consult with experts in liver transplantation in severe cases. Admission to the intensive care unit is recommended. Initial treatment involves supportive management with intravenous fluids, intravenous glucose and blood products, including fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate to correct DIC. The foetus should be monitored with cardiotocography. After the mother is stabilized, arrangements are usually made for delivery. This may occur vaginally, but, in cases of severe bleeding or compromise of the mother's status, a caesarian section may be needed. Often AFLP is not diagnosed until the mother and baby are in trouble, so it is most likely that an emergency C-section is needed. The complications of acute fatty liver of pregnancy may require treatment after delivery, especially if pancreatitis occurs. Liver transplantation is rarely required for treatment of the condition, but may be needed for mothers with severe DIC, those with rupture of the liver, or those with severe encephalopathy. Epidemiology  Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare condition and occurs in approximately one in 7,000 to one in 15,000 pregnancies. The mortality from acute fatty liver of pregnancy has been reduced significantly to 18%, and is now related primarily to complications, particularly DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) and infections. After delivery, most mothers do well, as the stimulus for fatty acid overload is removed. The disease can recur in future pregnancies, with a calculated genetic chance of 25%; the actual rate is lower, however. Mortality of the foetus has also diminished significantly, but still remains 23%, and may be related to the need for premature delivery. History The disease was first described in 1940 by H. L. Sheehan as an \\"acute yellow atrophy\\" of the liver, then thought to be related to delayed chloroform poisoning.

The dam impounds the Little Tennessee River and the lower Tellico River. While TVA is careful to refer to its artificial lakes as reservoirs (such as \\"Tellico Reservoir\\"), common usage tends to refer to the reservoir as \\"Tellico Lake\\". The lake is approximately 16,000 acres in surface area and provides 357 miles of shoreline.Tellico Village - Lake Tellico Tellico Reservoir was to be created as the last major dam and reservoir project of the TVA. Planning had begun for the project in the 1960s, when the agency began acquiring properties that had to be vacated prior to flooding of a large area subject to inundation. The National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) of 1970 provided for agencies to assess the environmental effects of their projects prior to undertaking them. Opponents of the dam project, who were concerned about its effects on the habitat of the valley, filed suit for an environmental impact assessment to be done, although the project was already underway when NEPA was passed. An endangered species, the snail darter, was discovered and some people wanted construction of the dam to be halted. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provided for protection of species threatened with extinction under federal projects. The snail darter controversy generated reactions on both sides, and litigation in the case reached the Supreme Court, under the Endangered Species Act. It ruled that the project was not exempted although it had been started prior to passage of the act. Congress passed a law to specifically exempt the Tellico Dam project from application of the Endangered Species Act, in order to complete the project. The dam was completed, 33 miles of river fed the lake, and Tellico Reservoir was created. Creation of the reservoir meant that several communities in the valley had to be abandoned and residents relocated. In addition, the waters inundated several Native American sites, including the historically significant Cherokee Nation town sites of Chota and Tanasi. The Bat Creek inscription was discovered adjacent to this lake.

For the Royal Malaysian Navy bid, the German Naval Group proposed the Blohm + Voss MEKO 100 for the design and delivery a new class of offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Malaysian Navy. Under the German Naval Group proposal, the first batch of ships will be built in German shipyards while the remainder of the order will be fulfilled by ships built in Malaysian shipyards. The group consists of the German shipyards: * Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG, Kiel * Blohm + Voss GmbH, Hamburg * Nordsee Werke GmbH, Emden The German Naval Group commercial partner includes MAN Ferrostaal that supplies marine diesels. The consortium grouping enables the group to offer a complete range of naval vessels and services to customers. Royal Malaysian Navy requirement The Royal Malaysian Navy requirement was a substantial purchase and attracted many bids from interested shipbuilders. American shipbuilders have traditionally not done well in Malaysia and were ruled out early on. Australia‚Äôs Transfield group was a strong contender for the project, as the Royal Australian Navy was also then looking into the building of a class of patrol vessels. Australian political leadership lent weight to the Australian proposal, with the message of the benefits of a regional collaborative effort in building the common design. British shipyards have done well in previous bids and remained a front runner. Yarrow have previously supplied Malaysia with its two FFL frigates. The German Naval Group (GNG) won the bid to build the NGPV for the Royal Malaysian Navy and was awarded the initial contract 13 October 1998 for an initial six units based on the Blohm + Voss MEKO 100 design. The German Naval Group is the major sub-contractor on the NGPV programme, and Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss will build the first two ships deliver them to Malaysia for final fitting-out and trials. The class of ship has now been called the Kedah Class Offshore Patrol Vessel. The other four ships are to be built at the PSC-Naval Dockyard in Malaysia from ship sets supplied by the German Naval Group. PSC- Naval Dockyard in Lumut, Malaysia, is the prime contractor for all six of the Malaysian ships. The order for six ships is the first group in a series of a planned purchase of 27 vessels. The Malaysian government was to pay 20% advance payment of the total RM5.6 billion. The advance came to RM1.07 billion. Of this, RM243 million was paid to PSC-Naval Dockyard with the balance of RM928 million still payable to the company. The Royal Malaysian Navy had intended the building of 27 OPVs under the program. The initial order of six vessels with PSC-Naval Dockyard (and the German Naval Group) will involve technology transfer from the German Naval Group to PSC-Naval Dockyard. The contract would include the supply of spare parts for the first two years, after which the spare parts will be manufactured in Malaysia by PSC Naval Dockyard. The contract also specified a local content of not less than 30 percent, and an offset program of not less than 30% of the contract value. The German Naval Group is also to make a counter purchase obligation amounting to 11% of the contract value. The German Naval Group has now been formally merged under the ThyssenKrupp companies. Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft AG was purchased in 2005 to complete the triumvirate of HDW, NDW and Blohm + Voss in ThyssenKrupp Marine.

Recognition  SPA New Delhi has a special status as \\"Institutes of National Importance\\" under an act of Parliament, due to which the degrees provided by SPA need not be recognized by the AICTE.Welcome To AICTE The JEE and GATE are important factor behind the success of SPA, as it enables the SPA to accept only a select group of meritorious students. This combination of success factors has led to the concept of the SPA Brand. Other factors that have contributed to the success of SPA are stringent faculty recruitment procedures and industry collaboration. The procedure for selection of faculty in SPA is stricter as compared to other colleges offering similar degrees. = Educational rankings = Nationwide, SPA New Delhi is consistently ranked above any other colleges with similar academic offerings.

They are built around one or more PowerPC cores and the Communications Processor Module (QUICC Engine) which is a separate RISC core specialized in such tasks such as I/O, communications, ATM, security acceleration, networking and USB. Many components are System-on-a-chip designs tailor-made for embedded applications. PowerQUICC processors are used in networking, automotive, industrial, storage, printing and consumer applications. Freescale are using PowerQUICC processors as a part of their mobileGT platform. Freescale also manufactures QUICC microcontrollers based on the older 68k technology. There are four distinct lines of processors, mainly based on processing power.  PowerQUICC I  Sun Fire V20z '' The MPC8xx family was Motorola's first PowerPC based embedded processors, suited for network processors and system-on-a-chip devices. The core is an original implementation of the PowerPC specification. It is a single issue, four stage pipelined core with MMU and branch prediction unit with speeds up to 133 MHz. The MPC821 was introduced in 1995 together with MPC860 with a complete QUICC engine. A slimmed down version, MPC850 with reduced caches and IO ports came in 1997. The QUICC communication processor module (CPM) offloads networking tasks from the CPU, thus branding this family as PowerQUICC. All processors in the family differ in on-chip features like USB, serial, PCMCIA, ATM and Ethernet controllers and different amount of L1 caches ranging from 1 KiB up to 16 KiB. MPC8xx ‚Äì All PowerQUICC processors share this common naming scheme. * MPC821 ‚Äì The first embedded PowerPC processor, with integrated CPM, but no FPU and came in speeds up to 50 MHz * MPC860 ‚Äì The first PowerPC with fully integrated QUICC engine, with speeds up to 80 MHz * MPC850 ‚Äì A low-cost, stripped MPC860 with integrated USB and Ethernet. Speeds up to 50 MHz  PowerQUICC II  MPC8245 in a Qlogic SANbox 5200 Fibre Channel switch PowerQUICC II was introduced in 1998 and is the direct descendant of PowerPC 603e and the core also goes under the name 603e or G2. The processors still have 16/16 KiB instruction/data L1 caches, and are reaching frequencies up to 450 MHz. These communications processors are used in applications like VoIP systems, telecom switches, cellular base stations and DSLAMs. The PowerQUICC II family of processors are phased out in favour for the more powerful PowerQUICC II Pro line. There's no plans for further development of this core. MPC82xx ‚Äì All PowerQUICC II processors share this common naming scheme. = PowerQUICC II Pro = Introduced in 2004, based on the e300 core, an enhanced PowerPC 603e core, with 32/32 KiB instruction/data L1 caches. PowerQUICC II Pro is used as networking processors for routers, switches, printers, network-attached storage, wireless access points and DSLAMs. PowerQUICC II Pro processors reaches 677 MHz, and can include a multitude of embedded technologies like USB, PCI, Ethernet and security devices. They also use a newer QUICC Engine network offload engine instead of the CPM used in the original PowerQUICC I and PowerQUICC II series. The memory controller provides support for DDR and DDR2 SDRAMs. MPC83xx ‚Äì All PowerQUICC II Pro processors share this common naming scheme. A trailing \\"E\\" signifies that the processors have a built in encryption module.

It has a dual issue, seven- stage pipeline with double precision FPUs, 32/32 KiB data and instruction L1 caches, multiple Gigabit Ethernet, PCI and PCIe, RapidIO, DDR/DDR2 memory controllers, and security accelerators. Speeds ranges from 533 MHz up to 1.5 GHz. These processors target enterprise level networking and telecom applications, high end storage, printing and imaging. Some of the processors use the older CPM module for the handling network processing offload, some use the newer QUICC Engine (same as in PowerQUICC II Pro), and some do not have a CPM or QUICC Engine at all. Freescale's marketing department nevertheless brand all devices in the 85xx series as being \\"PowerQUICC III\\". MPC85xx ‚Äì All PowerQUICC III processors share this common naming scheme. A trailing \\"E\\" signifies that the processors have a built-in encryption module. * MPC8540 ‚Äì The world's first RapidIO enabled host processor. Includes dual Gigabit Ethernet controllers, ideal for routers. Speeds from 600 MHz to 1 GHz. * MPC8548/47/43/41(E) ‚Äì A family of integrated devices included PCI Express and RapidIO, along with a single e500 core. Each lower number has fewer abilities than its higher-numbered siblings. * MPC8544 ‚Äì Similar to the 8548, but produced in a cost-saving 90 nm process and with some differences in the actual feature set. * MPC8560 ‚Äì Similar to the 8540, this was the first PQ III device launched. It includes a CPM along with the e500 core. * MPC8568/68E/67/67E ‚Äì Uses the QUICC Engine instead of a CPM, the 8567 has a reduced set of peripheral units. * MPC8569E ‚Äì e500v2 core frequency of 1.33 GHz, 45 nm fabrication process, enhanced QUICC engine, rich set of peripherals and low power requirements. * MPC8572E ‚Äì Uses dual e500 cores with speed up to 1.5 GHz. Used in high end application-aware networking equipment like firewalls and antivirus devices (from Kaspersky Lab).  Future  PowerQUICC will cease development in favor of the software-compatible QorIQ platform featuring all PowerPC e500 based processors, from single core, through multi- core, up to 32 cores. Freescale will keep manufacturing PowerQUICC processors in the foreseeable future for existing customers, but they will help facilitate the transition to QorIQ.

It generally ran north from Port Huron along the Lake Huron shoreline through The Thumb region before turning inland. The highway crossed The Thumb and then ran along the Saginaw Bay shoreline before running inland again, terminating at Saginaw. It was one of the original state highways signposted in 1919, but it was renumbered as other highways in 1926, decommissioning the designation in the process. Parts of its route are now M-25, M-81 and M-142. Route description M-31 started at M-21 in Port Huron and ran northward along the Lake Huron shoreline. Along the way, it intersected the western terminus of M-46 before reaching Harbor Beach. In town, the original M-27 merged in from the north, and M-27/M-31 ran concurrently westward, turning inland. The two highways separated north of Ruth as M-27 turned southward. M-31 continued across The Thumb through Bad Axe, where it ran concurrently with M-19 in town. The highway carried on westward through Elkton and Pigeon to Bay Port. Once there, the trunkline turned southwesterly to follow along part of the Saginaw Bay. The road passed through Sebewaing to Unionville before turning back inland. Running southward to Akron, the highway turned alternately westward and southward to Fairgrove. M-31 next ran west along Bradleyville Road to a connection with M-81; the two highways ran concurrently south through Gilford before M-31 separated and turned back westward through Reese to Saginaw. The northern terminus in downtown Saginaw was at an intersection with what was then M-10. History When the state highway system was first signed in 1919, M-31 was one of the original trunklines, originally running northward from Port Huron to Harbor Beach and then westward to Saginaw. When the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, M-31 was decommissioned in favor of alternate numbers. From Port Huron north to Harbor Beach, M-29 was extended as a replacement. The segment west to Bay Port was renumbered M-83 while from Bad Axe west it was also additionally part of M-29 to Unionville.

The Marathas defeated the Adilshahi forces. It was their first significant military victory against a major regional power, and led to the eventual establishment of the Maratha Empire. Background Shivaji held a commendable position in parts of Maval. The Adilshahi court wanted to curb his activities. Afzal Khan, a renowned general of Bijapur who had previously killed Shivaji's elder brother Sambhaji in a battle, was selected to lead an assault against Shivaji. He started from Bijapur in 1659. Shivaji met Afzal Khan on 10 November 1659 and killed him in a truce negotiation. Shivaji's forces then routed the scattered Adilshahi army. Combat of Shivaji and Afzal Khan Shivaji sent an emissary to Afzal Khan, stating that he did not want to fight and was ready for peace. A meeting was arranged between Shivaji and Afzal Khan at a shamiyana (highly decorated tent) at the foothills of Pratapgad. It was agreed that they would bring only ten personal bodyguards each with them. All the ten bodyguards would remain 'one arrow-shot' away from the pair. Shivaji chose Sambhaji Kondhalkar, Jiva Mahala, Siddi Ibrahim, Kataji Ingle, Kondaji Kank, Yesaji Kank, Krishnaji Gayakwad, Surji Katake, Visaji Murambak & Sambhaji Karvar for the meet.Afzal Khan hid a katyar (a small dagger) in his coat, and Shivaji wore armour underneath his clothes and carried a concealed wagh nakha in one hand. As the two men entered the tent, the 6'7\\" tall Khan embraced Shivaji. He then tried to strangle Shivaji in his vice-like grip and pierced his dagger in Shivaji. But the armour under Shivaji's clothes saved him. Shivaji retaliated by using his \\"wagh nakh\\" (tiger claws) to slash Khan's stomach and disemboweled Khan. Thereupon Afzal Khan's bodyguard Bada Sayyed attacked Shivaji with swords but Jiva Mahala, Shivaji's personal bodyguard fatally struck him down. Also a lawyer of afzal khan krushna bhaskar kulkarni attacked on shivaji.Shivaji aware he killed krushna kulkarni by sword. Afzal Khan managed to hold his gushing entrails and hurtled, faint and bleeding, outside the tent and threw himself into his palanquin. The bearers hastily lifted their charge and began moving rapidly away down the slope. Sambhaji Kavji Kondhalkar, Shivaji's lieutenant and one of the accompanying guards, gave chase and beheaded Afzal Khan. The severed head was later sent to Rajgad to be shown to Shivaji's mother, Jijabai. She had long wanted vengeance for the deliberate maltreatment of Shahaji (Shivaji's father) while a captive of Afzal Khan, and for his role in the death of her elder brother, Sambhaji Shahaji raje Bhosle. Shivaji sped up the slope towards the fortress and his lieutenants ordered cannons to be fired. It was a signal to his infantry, hidden in the densely forested valley, to raid the Adilshahi forces. =Hand- to-hand combat of the forces= Maratha troops commanded by Shivaji's captain Kanhoji Jedhe, swept down on Afzal Khan's 1,500 musketeers; resulting in a complete rout of the musketeers at the foothills of the fort. Then in a rapid march, a section of Adilshahi forces commanded by Musekhan was attacked. Musekhan, Afzal Khan's lieutenant, was wounded and subsequently fled the field. Meanwhile, Moropant led the Maratha infantry toward the left flank of Adilshahi troops. The suddenness of this attack on Afzal Khan's artillery at close quarters made them ineffective in providing artillery cover for the main portion of their troops. And as a result of this the rest of their troops rapidly succumbed to an all out Maratha attack. Simultaneously Shivaji's Sardar (captain), Ragho Atre's cavalry units swooped down and attacked the large but unprepared Adilshahi cavalry before they were able to be fully geared up for battle and succeeded in completely routing them in short order. The Maratha cavalry under Netaji Palkar pursued the retreating Adilshahi forces, who were attempting to join up with the part of their reserve forces stationed in the nearby village of Wai. They were engaged in battle before they could regroup and were defeated prior to reaching Wai. The Adilshahi forces not withstanding the onslaught of the Marathas started retreating towards Bijapur. The Maratha army chased the retreating army and on their way captured 23 Adilshahi forts. In fact, the Adilshahi Killedar of the Kolhapur fort himself handed over the keys to the Marathas. Aftermath Adilshahi forces lost their artillery, 65 elephants, 4000 horses, 1200 camels, jewels worth 300,000 Rupees, 1,000,000 Rupees, heaps of precious clothes, tents to the Marathas. They also lost their money and grain stored at Wai. 5,000 Adilshahi soldiers were killed and almost as many were wounded. 3,000 soldiers were imprisoned, and the remainder were allowed to go home in defeat. The Marathas lost 1,734 soldiers, while 420 soldiers were wounded. As it was the policy of Shivaji to humanely treat the defeated army, neither the men nor women were sold as slaves or molested. Wounded commanders were offered treatment deserving of their rank and either imprisoned or sent back to Bijapur. Some of the defeated Adilshahi generals like Siddi Hilal changed their loyalties and joined the Marathas to serve under Shivaji. Two of Afzal Khan‚Äôs sons were captured by the Marathas but were let off by the Shivaji. Fazal khan (son of Afzal Khan) and the Adilshahi soldiers with him who were badly injured were shown a safe passage out of the forest of Jawli by Prataprao More. Shivaji also buried Afzal Khan as per Islamic customs and built his tomb near Pratapgarh, as per his philosophy of ‚Äòonce the enemy is dead, the enmity is dead too‚Äô. The sword of honour was presented to Kanhoji Jedhe for his invaluable and outstanding performance of service to Shivaji. The relatives of the killed soldiers were offered service in the Maratha army. Families without any male left alive to support, the family were awarded pensions. Heroes of the war were rewarded with medals, kada (bracelets) and horses. Khan's death dealt the Adilshah's rule a severe blow. A quarter of his territory, forts and a fifth of his army were captured or destroyed, while King Shivaji doubled his territory, losing a tenth of his army, within fifteen days of the Battle of Pratapgadh. Shivaji maintained his momentum, sending cavalry towards Kolhapur, which succeeded in capturing seventeen forts, including the prestigious fort of Panhala. Cavalry was also sent towards Dabhol and Rajapur under the command of Doroji Patil, which was successful in capturing forts in the southern Konkan. This remarkable victory made Shivaji a hero of Maratha folklore and a legendary figure among his people. Having established military dominance and successfully beaten back a major attack by a powerful empire, Shivaji had founded the nucleus of what would become the Maratha Empire.

The beatification was celebrated on 14 September 2003 on the occasion of Pope John Paul II visiting Slovakia.Patron Saints Index: Blessed Cecilia Schelingova Life Cec√≠lia Schelingov√° was born at Kriv√° na Orave as the tenth of eleven children to Pavol Scheling and Zuzana P√°nikov√° on 24 December 1916 and was baptized right after her birth. Her initial studies spanned from 1922 until 1930 and her call to the religious life began to blossom in 1929 when the Sisters of Charity of the Holy Cross arrived in her hometown to educate there. On 6 July 1931 - with her mother going with her to the motherhouse - she requested to join the congregation but she could not pronounce her profession or join the order until she completed a nursing course as well as a radiological course that the order requested she do. The postulant then commenced her period of novitiate on 28 January 1936. She made her initial vows on 30 January 1937 while assuming the religious name of \\"Zdenka\\". She began to work at the hospital at Humenn√© from 1937 near modern Ukraine and then relocated to the hospital at Bratislava in 1942 where she worked in the radiological department. She made her solemn profession on 28 January 1943. In 1952 she began to serve in the x-ray area. The communists soon assumed total power in the nation in 1948 and started their mass persecution of religious and priest alike with countless arrested and tortured with some sent in droves to the hospital for treatment. She aided the ailing priest Sandtner and celebrated forbidden Mass with him and managed to get him to remain in hospital when authorities deemed his condition to have improved instead of watching him being sent back to prison. In February 1952 she aided the politically-vocal condemned priest Stefan Kostial flee from his fate which would have been death in Siberia when she slipped sleeping pills into a guard's tea allowing the priest to flee; she organized this on 19 February - a day before the priest was to appear in court. Kostial had been jailed and then hospitalized after being tortured. On 29 February 1952 she attempted to aid three priests and three seminarians flee but she failed to do this and was instead arrested and tortured. Before her court appearance she lived in a cold and windowless cell. Schelingov√° was sentenced on 17 June 1952 to over a decade of imprisonment of a period that was defined as 1952 until 1964 and from that point to 1955 she was sent from prison to prison (such as in Bratislava and Brno) where she was often beaten and tortured. Torture saw her right breast torn apart from continual kicks and breast cancer soon set in as a result. She soon was admitted into a prison ward of the Prague hospital in 1954 where it was amputated without anesthesia. Helen Korda - a political prisoner who herself underwent an operation around the same time - agreed to look after the recovering Schelingov√°. Apol√≥nia Galis (d. 21 June 2003) visited her in prison with a guard present though secretly bought her cakes with vitamins contained in them in order to take care of her health. Government officials secured her release from prison on 16 April 1955 - a decade before her actual release date - so that she would not die on the government's watch. But police harassment saw her no longer welcome at the motherhouse of her order and from the hospital where she worked. It was Galis who lived in Trnava took her in. She was admitted into the Trnava hospital on 19 April 1955 and she remained there in ill health until her death. Schelingov√° died at dawn on 31 July 1955 after she received the sacraments for the final time. Her remains were relocated in 1979 and then for the final time on 6 June 2003. On 6 April 1970 the regional Bratislava court ruled that the late nun was in fact innocent having received a \\"false and artificial accusation\\" that had been motivated for political purposes rather that in the pursuit of justice. Beatification The beatification process commenced on 22 February 2000 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled the late religious as a Servant of God. This allowed for a diocesan process to open to investigate the life of the nun and it spanned from 18 September 2000 until its solemn closure on 12 January 2003 which led to the C.C.S. validating the process on 31 January 2003 in Rome; the C.C.S. then received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2003. Theologians discussed and approved the cause on 2 May 2003 while the C.C.S. themselves approved it as well on 3 June 2003. The pope approved the cause on 7 July 2003 and determined that - though not murdered - her persecution and her declining health after her prison time made her a martyr. She received beatification from Pope John Paul II on 14 September 2003 when the pope visited Slovakia. Her niece Marge Van Lierde - along with her husband and two children - attended the celebration and were seated in the eighth row. The process for the miracle needed for her sainthood was investigated in the Archdiocese of Denver in the United States of America and Archbishop Samuel Joseph Aquila oversaw the start of the diocesan process on 16 October 2013 and its conclusion on 28 February 2016. The current postulator assigned to this cause is the Rev. ƒΩudov√≠t Pokojn√Ω.

It passed through many smaller stations along the way (most of which are now closed). When work at Fleetwood docks was under threat in the mid-1960s, the main Fleetwood station was closed; the remainder of the branch south to Poulton followed in 1970. Proposals exist to re-open the branch to passenger services in the near future.  History  The line was first opened in 1840. In 1966, station was closed, and station became the terminus; however, four years later in 1970 passenger services were curtailed as far as . The line continued as a freight route to access the ICI plant at until 1999, when all traffic on the line ceased.  Current situation  Poulton-le-Fylde Junction, where the disused line joins the main line to Blackpool (pictured in 2008) Some of the track is now clear of being overgrown as the northern track was never lifted up past to just beyond Jameson Road Fleetwood although the road bridge was filled in below it. On this stretch the junction is still there where goods trains used to take coal to Fleetwood Power Station. If you look over the road bridge on Jameson Road you can still see the track (to both north & south) through the undergrowth. In the 1990s, the new A585 Amounderness Way bypass was built on the former trackbed, though sufficient space still exists for a reinstated railway should it be required.  Future of the branch  The Association of Train Operating Companies has supported the re-opening of the branch line to Fleetwood in its Connecting Communities report, and Lancashire County Council's (LCC) Rail Improvement Schemes draft report in March 2010 stated the case for re-opening was \\"compelling\\". Network Rail has stated that a feasibility study must first take place, which would cost around ¬£30,000. As well as re-opening the branch, it is likely that a third platform would also be constructed at Poulton-le-Fylde. The cost of re-opening the branch is estimated at ¬£5.5 million as the northern track is still in situ to just past Jameson Road, Fleetwood. In January 2020, the government announced funding of ¬£100,000 for a feasibility study of the route.

Zhuge Liang moved towards the Wuzhang Plains and prepared to cross to the north side of the Wei River. Sima Yi sent Zhou Dang () into position at Yangsui (ÈôΩÈÅÇ; the area north of the Wei River in present-day Mei and Fufeng counties, Shaanxi) and to lure Zhuge Liang to attack him. Zhuge Liang did not mobilise his troops for several days. Sima Yi said, \\"Zhuge Liang wants to take control of the Wuzhang Plains and won't advance towards Yangsui. His intention is obvious.\\" He then sent Hu Zun () and Guo Huai to defend Yangsui. Several days later, when Guo Huai received news that Zhuge Liang was planning to launch an attack in the west, his subordinates wanted to strengthen the defences in that area. Guo Huai was the only one who recognised that it was a ruse, and that Zhuge Liang was actually planning to attack Yangsui. He was proven right later when the Shu forces attacked Yangsui at night. However, as Guo Huai had set up defences earlier, the Shu forces failed to capture Yangsui. Zhuge Liang could not advance further so he retreated to the Wuzhang Plains.(‰∫ÆÊûú‰∏äÂéüÔºåÂ∞áÂåóÊ∏°Ê∏≠ÔºåÂ∏ùÈÅ£Â∞áËªçÂë®Áï∂Â±ØÈôΩÈÅÇ‰ª•È§å‰πã„ÄÇÊï∏Êó•Ôºå‰∫Æ‰∏çÂãï„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∫ÆÊ¨≤Áà≠ÂéüËÄå‰∏çÂêëÈôΩÈÅÇÔºåÊ≠§ÊÑèÂèØÁü•‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅ£Â∞áËªçËÉ°ÈÅµ„ÄÅÈõçÂ∑ûÂâåÂè≤ÈÉ≠Ê∑ÆÂÖ±ÂÇôÈôΩÈÅÇÔºåËàá‰∫ÆÊúÉ‰∫éÁ©çÁü≥„ÄÇËá®ÂéüËÄåÊà∞Ôºå‰∫Æ‰∏çÂæóÈÄ≤ÔºåÈÇÑ‰∫é‰∫î‰∏àÂéü„ÄÇ) Jin Shu vol. 1.(ÂæåÊï∏Êó•Ôºå‰∫ÆÁõõÂÖµË•øË°åÔºåË´∏Â∞áÁöÜË¨ÇÊ¨≤ÊîªË•øÂúçÔºåÊ∑ÆÁç®‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ê≠§Ë¶ãÂΩ¢ÊñºË•øÔºåÊ¨≤‰ΩøÂÆòÂÖµÈáçÊáâ‰πãÔºåÂøÖÊîªÈôΩÈÅÇËÄ≥„ÄÇÂÖ∂Â§úÊûúÊîªÈôΩÈÅÇÔºåÊúâÂÇô‰∏çÂæó‰∏ä„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 26.

Zhuge Liang was worried that he could not impose his will due to the lack of reliable supplies, so he divided the army and laid the foundation for a long-term presence.

One day, Zhuge Liang sent a woman's ornaments to Sima Yi to taunt him to come out and fight. Sima Yi felt enraged and wanted to attack Zhuge Liang, but Cao Rui denied him permission and ordered him to remain in camp. Cao Rui even gave Xin Pi his imperial sceptre (a symbol of the emperor's authority) and sent him to the Wuzhang Plains to keep an eye on Sima Yi. When Zhuge Liang taunted him again, Sima Yi wanted to attack the enemy, but Xin Pi used the authority of the imperial sceptre to order him to remain in camp.(...

Sometime between 11 September and 10 October 234, Zhuge Liang became critically ill and his condition worsened daily. When the Shu emperor Liu Shan heard about it, he sent Li Fu () to the Wuzhang Plains to ask Zhuge Liang about succession. Zhuge Liang replied that Jiang Wan could succeed him and that Fei Yi in turn could succeed Jiang Wan. When Li Fu asked again about Fei Yi's successor, Zhuge Liang did not respond. Li Fu then returned to the Shu capital, Chengdu. Before his death, Zhuge Liang gave secret orders to Yang Yi, Fei Yi, and Jiang Wei to lead the Shu army on a retreat back to Shu after his death, with Wei Yan in charge of the rearguard and Jiang Wei to follow behind. If Wei Yan refused to follow the order, they were to retreat without him.

According to folklore, Sima Yi retreated after he saw a wooden statue of Zhuge Liang and thought that Zhuge Liang was still alive. In some variations of this legend, it was Jiang Wei who disguised himself as Zhuge Liang to scare away Sima Yi. Some days later, Sima Yi surveyed the remains of the Shu camp and retrieved maps, many documents and considerable food supplies. He concluded that Zhuge Liang was indeed dead and said, \\"He was a rare talent in this world.\\" Xin Pi felt that they could not be certain about Zhuge Liang's death yet, but Sima Yi said, \\"The most important things for an army are its documents, troops, horses, and supplies. [Zhuge Liang] has abandoned all of them. How can a person lose his five most important organs and still be alive? We should quickly pursue [the enemy].\\" The ground in the Guanzhong region was full of devil's weed so Sima Yi sent 2,000 men wearing wooden clogs with flat soles to clear the path before his main army advanced. When Sima Yi reached Chi'an (), he confirmed that Zhuge Liang was dead. When he asked the civilians living there, they told him that there was a recent popular saying: \\"A dead Zhuge scares away a living Zhongda.\\" When Sima Yi heard that, he laughed and said, \\"I can predict the thoughts of the living but I can't predict the dead's.\\"(Á∂ìÊó•Ôºå‰πÉË°åÂÖ∂ÁáüÂ£òÔºåËßÄÂÖ∂ÈÅ∫‰∫ãÔºåÁç≤ÂÖ∂ÂúñÊõ∏„ÄÅÁ≥ßÁ©ÄÁîöË°Ü„ÄÇÂ∏ùÂØ©ÂÖ∂ÂøÖÊ≠ªÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§©‰∏ãÂ•áÊâç‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçËæõÊØó‰ª•ÁÇ∫Â∞öÊú™ÂèØÁü•„ÄÇÂ∏ùÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËªçÂÆ∂ÊâÄÈáçÔºåËªçÊõ∏ÂØÜË®à„ÄÅÂÖµÈ¶¨Á≥ßÁ©ÄÔºå‰ªäÁöÜÊ£Ñ‰πãÔºåË±àÊúâ‰∫∫ÊçêÂÖ∂‰∫îËóèËÄåÂèØ‰ª•Áîü‰πéÔºüÂÆúÊÄ•ËøΩ‰πã„ÄÇ„ÄçÈóú‰∏≠Â§öËí∫ËîæÔºåÂ∏ù‰ΩøËªçÂ£´‰∫åÂçÉ‰∫∫ËëóËªüÊùêÂπ≥Â∫ïÊú®Â±êÂâçË°åÔºåËí∫ËîæÊÇâËëóÂ±êÔºåÁÑ∂ÂæåÈ¶¨Ê≠•‰ø±ÈÄ≤„ÄÇËøΩÂà∞Ëµ§Â≤∏Ôºå‰πÉÁü•‰∫ÆÊ≠ªÂØ©Âïè„ÄÇÊôÇÁôæÂßìÁÇ∫‰πãË´∫Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≠ªË´∏ËëõËµ∞Áîü‰ª≤ÈÅî„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ùËÅûËÄåÁ¨ëÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæ‰æøÊñôÁîüÔºå‰∏ç‰æøÊñôÊ≠ªÊïÖ‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç) Jin Shu vol. 1.

The Shu emperor Liu Shan asked the ministers Dong Yun and Jiang Wan for their opinions. Both of them sided with Yang Yi and felt that Wei Yan's actions were suspicious. In the meantime, Yang Yi ordered his men to cut down trees to rebuild the gallery roads, and his troops marched day and night to catch up with Wei Yan. Wei Yan arrived at the southern valley first and ordered his soldiers to attack Yang Yi. Yang Yi sent Wang Ping to resist Wei Yan.

Thus the death of Zhuge Liang ended a huge strategic threat to Cao Wei and the Wei court soon began development of an ambitious program of public works. Sima Yi's success and subsequent rise in prominence paved the way for his grandson Sima Yan's founding of the Jin dynasty, which would eventually bring an end to the Three Kingdoms period. In popular culture The battle is featured as one of the final playable stages in Koei's video game series Dynasty Warriors. The earlier instalments of the game changed the original account of the battle: certain characters such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, who had historically died more than a decade before the battle, survived until then to participate in the battle. However, the most recent instalment has made the battle more accurate than it was in the earlier instalments. Notes References Bibliography * Chen, Shou.

It needs to be able to suck out and pump through into its tank any road grit and miscellaneous solids that have entered the hollow. Some have a means of squeezing the water from its load, and letting that water into the drain or keeping it for high pressure cleaning of drain pipes. Differences to vacuum truck A vehicle which is purely a vacuum truck has a long wide flexible hose without the big solid nozzle with controls on. Gully emptiers are often outfitted with devices to separate the liquid content of its tank from solid matter, allowing the liquids to run to storm drain. Since this is not done with cesspool content, cesspool emptiers have no need for such separative capability. Sometimes a gully emptier has a flexible hose without solid nozzle like on a cesspool emptier.

The series revolves around Amelia 'Mia' Thermopolis, a teenager in New York City who discovers that she is the princess of a small European principality called Genovia. The books are noted for containing many popular culture references, which include singers, movies, and fads in modern culture. Meg Cabot quotes the series' inspiration on her website stating: \\"I was inspired to write The Princess Diaries when my mom, after the death of my father, began dating one of my teachers; they later went on to get married just as Mia's mom does in the book! I have always had a 'thing' for princesses (my parents used to joke that when I was smaller, I did a lot of insisting that my 'real' parents, the king and queen, were going to come get me soon, and that everyone had better start being a LOT nicer to me) so I stuck a princess in the book just for kicks... and VOIL√Ä! The Princess Diaries was born.\\"The Princess Diaries, Vol I, Meg Cabot The latest book in the series, The Princess Diaries, Volume XI: Royal Wedding was published in 2015. A spin-off series for tweens featuring Mia's half-sister, From the Notebooks of a Middle School Princess was released in May 2015. Series description :Plot summaries have been moved to their individual volume pages. The story of Mia Thermopolis' adolescent turmoil as an average teenager and, as she later finds out, a princess of royal descent (her father), is chronicled in her on-going journal, where she explores topics of teenage angst, romance, and heartbreak as she lives and learns from them. The main series follows Mia from her freshman year of high school to her graduation, with a two-year jump between the ninth and tenth books and an eight year jump from the tenth to eleventh. Setting The series is set primarily in the Manhattan borough of New York City. Some books take place in Genovia, a European country. Genovia is a principality between France and Italy ruled by Mia's father, Prince Philippe Renaldo, and by Mia's grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi. Characters =Mia Thermopolis= Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi is the protagonist of the series. She is the product of a college romance between Helen Thermopolis, a painter, and Philippe Renaldo, the prince of Genovia. Having spent most of her life in Greenwich Village with her mother, Mia attends Albert Einstein High School, a private school in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Mia chronicles the main aspects of her life in various personal diaries, through which she also later develops her talent for various forms of writing. She prefers to be called Mia, although her best friend Lilly often bestows upon her nicknames such as BL (Baby Licker), POG (Princess Of Genovia), or PIT (Princess In Training). Mia is known for her sometimes shy and down-to-earth personality, though on occasion Mia shows herself to be quite sarcastic and sly. Mia also speaks to her self described flat chest, 5-foot-9 height, upside-down-triangle-shaped hair, and extremely large feet. She also has a tendency to over-analyze things and worry too much. Mia's spends her afternoons throughout the series with her grandmother (Grandmere) in princess lessons, which attempt to teach Mia the finer points of being a princess. These lessons range from making more princess-like Mia's sense of fashion, food, and relationships, and also inform about royal duties such as her visits during school breaks to Genovia and the events she must attend and speak at as a royal throughout the year as well. Mia develops an interest for writing during the series. Later in the series, Mia writes her own novel called Ransom My Heart, though she composes many poems, lists, and even screenplays throughout her years of writing in her diary. Mia, having been raised almost exclusively by her very liberal and feminist painter mother, is very socially conscientious; She is a vegetarian and also tries to use her fame to raise awareness for good causes, including donations to Greenpeace with the money her father pays her to take princess lessons from her grandmother. Between the tenth and eleventh books, Mia goes to college and establishes a youth community center. Mia's friendship with Lilly Moscovitz is a focal point of the series. Though they often clash due to Mia's insecurity and Lilly's forcefulness, they remain best friends until major conflicts arise in the later books of the series. Another central plot line of the books is Mia's relationship with Michael Moscovitz, Lilly's older brother. Their relationship survives obstacles throughout several books of the series, such as their age difference and Mia's (often overwrought) anxieties, as Mia works out how to effectively manage romantic relationships as a maturing adolescent. In Disney's \\"The Princess Diaries\\" 2001, Mia, who was portrayed by Anne Hathaway is aged 16, has a license to drive, and owns a 1965 Mustang. She has similar qualities, but her father is dead, and her last name is Renaldi instead of Renaldo, and she lives in San Francisco instead of New York. =Clarisse Marie Grimaldi Renaldo= Clarisse Marie was formally known as the Dowager Princess Clarisse Marie Grimaldi Renaldo. Clarisse is the dowager princess of Genovia and Mia's paternal grandmother. Mia refers to her as \\"Grand-m√®re\\" (French for \\"Grandmother\\"). As a young woman, she married Prince Rupert Renaldo and had one son. She habitually omits Mia's mother's surname \\"Thermopolis\\" from her granddaughter's lengthy list of names and titles, much to Mia's annoyance. She speaks French most of the time, but she can also speak English; however she disdains English as a vulgar language. She is almost always accompanied by her miniature poodle, Rommel, who is notable for having a severe case of OCD that causes him to lick his own fur off. She smokes often and enjoys drinking sidecars. She is not hesitant about lying or manipulating others in order to get her own way. She and Mia don't see eye to eye: Clarisse is concerned with attracting publicity to Genovia and ensuring Mia does not embarrass her country while Mia prefers to focus on politics. Though she and Mia butt heads often, she does care for her granddaughter and gives her advice about love and relationships that Mia takes with a grain of salt due to her grandmother's cold nature. For example, when Clarisse was married to the king of Genovia, she led him to believe that she was only interested in his status and money and never once said \\"I love you\\", in order to keep her husband on his toes. Mia also mentions that her father is terrified of his mother because she would lock him in the palace dungeons whenever he misbehaved (although when she informs him that he gives the appearance of being a little bit scared of Clarisse in Princess in the Spotlight, her father replies that he is not scared of his mother and that she really isn't as bad as Mia thinks; in his view, Clarisse \\"just needs proper handling\\"). While in New York to give Mia her princess lessons, the dowager princess resided in the Plaza Hotel, and was dissatisfied with other quality luxury hotels she was placed in during Princess On the Brink, when the Plaza was being remodeled. =Lilly Moscovitz= Mia's best friend since kindergarten, Lilly is a highly intelligent and opinionated person who has her own public-access television show, titled Lilly Tells It Like It Is, in which she discusses political and social issues. By the end of the series, her TV show is picked up by a network and is apparently very popular in South Korea. Mia admires Lilly's bravery and unwillingness to be pushed around by others, though Lilly knows her insensitivity and forceful personality can cause her to be disliked. Mia and Lilly often enjoy discussing popular culture, but Lilly's strong stances often cause her and Mia to clash, especially when Mia feels Lilly is becoming too critical of her. Nevertheless, Lilly's blunt attitude is what often keeps Mia from over-analyzing things, such as her relationship with Michael, Lilly's older brother. Mia was initially afraid to share her crush on Michael with Lilly, but in fact, Lilly was one of the conspirators who helped Mia and Michael get together in Princess in Love. Lilly is not considered to be very pretty; Mia often describes her face as being \\"squashed in like a pug's\\". However, she has a well-developed figure, which earns her several romantic suitors, including Boris Pelkowski, Mia's cousin Hank, Jangbu the immigrant busboy, J.P. Reynolds, and Kenny Showalter. Boris is Lilly's first boyfriend, but the relationship ends when she begins seeing Jangbu in Princess in Pink. In Party Princess, Lilly hooks up with J.P., but he dumps her in Princess On the Brink. Lilly becomes angry at Mia when she finds out that Mia kissed J.P., and refuses to speak to her any more, going so far as to start a website called 'ihatemiathermopolis.com'. Lilly ignores Mia's attempts to make up until she finds out that Mia is planning to lose her virginity to J.P., when she tells Mia about his lies and plans to use Mia's fame to his own advantage. Lilly also helps indirectly repair Mia and Michael's relationship. The girls make up and become best friends again; they are still close by the events of Royal Wedding, with Lilly now attending Columbia Law School. In the 2001 Disney Movie, Lilly, portrayed by Heather Matarazzo, is portrayed as intelligent, confident, and socially conscious. Her talk show is called \\"Shut Up and Listen\\". She is then a student at Berkeley. In The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, Mia appoints Lilly as her royal secretary. =Michael Moscovitz= Lilly's older brother, and Mia's main love interest throughout the series. Mia states that she has been in love with Michael since the day he came over to give Lilly a school project when they were in the first grade and he was in the fourth. From the end of the first book to the third, Mia has an unrequited crush on Michael, which he finally reciprocates in Princess in Love. Their relationship continues through Mia's sophomore year and Michael's first year at Columbia University, but their relationship becomes slightly strained when Michael tells Mia he would like to have sex, while Mia would prefer to wait until her prom night. Michael respects Mia's wishes but when Michael gets an offer to move to Japan, he believes it would be easier for their relationship as he is \\"tired of taking cold showers\\". Mia proposes sex in order to keep him from leaving, but is upset to find out that he slept with Judith Gershner before they began dating, and the two break up. Michael believes Mia is overreacting and attempts to reconcile with her before leaving for Japan, but is hurt to find her sharing a kiss with J.P. Mia attempts to reunite and work out the distance situation but Michael decides that it is best they remain \\"just friends\\" and they begin a regular email correspondence. When Michael returns from Japan after an absence of almost two years, he flirts with Mia during her interview for the school paper. Mia notices that Michael still looks incredibly hot and realises that she does still, indeed, love him. The two eventually kiss, despite Mia having a boyfriend, and Michael declares that he still loves Mia and will wait for her. They reunite on Mia's prom night and have sex. Michael has brown eyes and thick, dark hair and is tall. He is extremely handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying cooped up writing songs or on his computer the whole day. Mia insists that he is the third best-looking guy at AEHS after Josh Richter and Justin Baxendale and describes his nose as aquiline, mouth as \\"eminently kissable\\", and neck as aromatic due to an intoxicating blend of Tide from his shirt collar, his Gillette shaving foam, and Ivory soap. Michael is described as romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to run his own webzine, Crackhead, but had to disband it after an editorial stating the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss of advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael starts a band called Skinner Box (a name suggested by Mia) with a few friends, including Boris Pelkowski. Michael loves Mia just as she is, though her neurotic behavior and insecurity frustrate him. In fact, Michael is the one who often feels insecure in their relationship, because he knows Grandmere does not think he is an appropriate consort, and all the gossip magazines would much rather prefer to see Mia date a fellow royal or celebrity like James Franco or (as Mamaw suggests) Zac Efron. He moves to Japan to develop the CardioArm for this reason, believing it would prove to the world that he is, in fact, worthy of dating a princess. Michael returns to New York a multi-millionaire and the president/owner of his own robotics company, Pavlov Robotics, named after his dog. Michael donates a robot arm to Genovia from his company for free even though the waiting list is long, helping Mia's father win the election. Mia realizes that she is still in love with Michael, but tries to convince herself otherwise. When she and Michael kiss on a coach ride, however, she writes, \\"I can't do this to J.P. I just can't. Oh my God, though, I love Michael so much.\\" When J.P. and Mia split due to J.P using her and lying to her, she and Michael reunite, spending the night together. =Tina Hakim Baba= A student at AEHS, Tina is the daughter of a Saudi Arabian oil sheik and a British former supermodel. Because of her father's status, she has to have the protection of a bodyguard, Wahim, which isolates her from the other students until Mia sits with her after a fight with Lilly in the first novel. The three girls quickly develop a solid friendship, and Tina eventually uses her generous weekly allowance to support Lilly's public-access television show. She first goes out with Dave Farouq-El- Abar from another school, 'Trinity', and after he breaks up with her, she begins dating Boris Pelkowski. After Mia and Lilly's estrangement at the end of the eighth novel, Mia comes to see Tina as her best friend. Tina constantly reads romance novels, making Mia consider her an expert in romance. Though prone to imaginative flights of fancy and often a little silly, Tina can be extremely acute about both academic and social matters. She is very loyal to Mia, who often consults her for sensitive advice rather than the harsher Lilly. Tina also believes that she must remain pure, because she dreams that one day she will marry Prince William, and to do so, she must remain a virgin, though she admits to having slept with Boris by Forever Princess. She becomes a medical student at New York University, and has broken up with Boris by the beginning of book eleven, though they eventually get back together. =Secondary characters= * Lars van der Hooten: Mia's very protective Swedish bodyguard. He voices his mind in a way that is annoying when he thinks Mia is being particularly ridiculous, but goes along with her schemes anyway. He also turns a blind eye to Mia and Michael when they make out, for which Mia is grateful. He gets on very well with Michael (especially in the first book when Lars seems to know that Michael likes Mia), never offers any opinion on Lilly, and becomes friends with Tina's bodyguard, Wahim. Lars also likes Mia's French teacher Mademoiselle Klein. He is known to be a 'big softie' deep down inside. * Tina Hakim Baba: A student at AEHS, Tina is the daughter of a Saudi Arabian oil sheik and a British former supermodel. Because of her father's status, she has to have the protection of a bodyguard, Wahim, which isolates her from the other students until Mia sits with her after a fight with Lilly in the first novel. The three girls quickly develop a solid friendship, and Tina eventually uses her generous weekly allowance to support Lilly's public- access television show. She first goes out with Dave Farouq-El-Abar from another school, 'Trinity', and after he breaks up with her, she begins dating Boris Pelkowski. After Mia and Lilly's estrangement at the end of the eighth novel, Mia comes to see Tina as her best friend. Tina constantly reads romance novels, making Mia consider her an expert in romance. Though prone to imaginative flights of fancy and often a little silly, Tina can be extremely acute about both academic and social matters. She is very loyal to Mia, who often consults her for sensitive advice rather than the harsher Lilly. Tina also believes that she must remain pure, because she dreams that one day she will marry Prince William, and to do so, she must remain a virgin, though she admits to having slept with Boris by Forever Princess. She becomes a medical student at New York University, and has broken up with Boris by the beginning of book eleven, though they eventually get back together. * Helen Thermopolis: Mia's mother. She has a career as an artist and spends most of her time in her studio, and becomes pregnant with Frank's son and Mia's half brother Rocky in the second book. According to Mia, she is very pretty and her neck smells of Dove (soap), turpentine and coffee, but according to Mia's dad, her neck smells of freesias. She clearly wants the best for her daughter and is very carefree. * Frank Gianini: Mia's algebra and homeroom teacher. He dates her mother, Helen, and marries her when she becomes pregnant with Mia's half- brother, Rocky. He plays the drums, which annoys the neighbors. He is unfazed by his stepdaughter's fame, and treats her the same as every other student during class; he also \\"has a thing about cell-phone usage during class time\\", as Lana finds out in Princess in Waiting. Mia grows to appreciate his after- school algebra review sessions, and though their relationship begins awkwardly, Mia and Mr. G seem to get along well after the seventh installment. He passes away from a heart attack before the eleventh book, and Mia names her community center after him. * John Paul \\"J.P.\\" Reynolds Abernathy IV: Initially known as \\"The Guy Who Hates It When They Put Corn In the Chili,\\" J.P. meets Mia via Grandm√®re's school musical in Party Princess. He joins Mia's friend group soon after, and begins to date Lilly at the end of the book. J.P. is first described as having \\"broad shoulders, floppy brown hair, and surprisingly blue eyes,\\" though several characters later state that Mia and J.P. look good together because they are both so \\"tall and blond.\\" He breaks up with Lilly in book eight, and kisses Mia after her breakup with Michael. They grow closer in book nine, with shared interests in musicals and writing, and begin dating after he confesses his love for Mia. They break up in the last book when Mia finds out that he used her to further his playwriting career, and lied about saving his virginity for her. By Royal Wedding, he is an unsuccessful screenwriter and novelist, and continues attempting to reconcile with Mia. Michael later discovers that he is RoyalRabbleRouser - an Internet blogger posting vicious comments about Mia - and has him reported to Interpol. * Boris Pelkowski: A Russian violin virtuoso, and Lilly's boyfriend until book five. His habits include tucking his sweater into his pants, breathing through his mouth, and playing the violin in Gifted and Talented class, when everyone else wants him to be quiet. After Lilly dumps him, he starts dating Tina Hakim Baba. During the summer before sophomore year, he lifts weights, gets laser eye surgery and becomes (by Mia's standards) a hottie. Boris is a \\"say it like it is or say nothing at all\\" sort of guy. He becomes friends with Michael after joining his band, and in the ninth installment, it appears that they remain in contact, as he implores Mia to respond to Michael's emails so that he won't think she's 'forgotten' about him. By the eleventh book, he has become a popstar known as 'Boris P'. Tina breaks up with him when she finds photos of him with another girl, but they get back together at Mia and Michael's wedding when he proves that they were photoshopped. * Josh Richter: Lana Weinberger's boyfriend until the fifth book. He is on the crew team and is co-valedictorian. Mia describes him as the most attractive boy in school; he is very tall and muscular and has \\"electric\\" blue eyes. At the end of the first book, Josh takes Mia to the Cultural Diversity Dance, where he kisses her on the entrance steps of her school. Realizing that he used her to enter the media spotlight, Mia dumps him afterwards and tries to avoid him, even though this is difficult because of their adjacent lockers. * Lana Weinberger: A popular junior cheerleader with long blonde hair, a peaches-and-cream complexion, baby blue eyes and a voluptuous figure. She dates Josh Richter from the start of the series until the summer break between the fifth and sixth books, when they split up after he goes to college. Lana has a younger sister, Gretchen, who starts at AEHS in book eight and has a very similar personality. Lana is very spiteful towards Mia and constantly taunts her until a major shift in book nine, when she offers the olive branch after Lilly and Mia's friendship ends. They become good friends, with Mia noting that Lana is actually a nice but misunderstood person, though she is sometimes frustrated by Lana's shallowness. * Shameeka Taylor: One of Mia's friends, she has an overprotective father. She is athletic and the most attractive of Mia's friends, but also sensible, and headstrong, joining the cheerleading team because she is tired of letting Lana push her around. After she joins the cheerleaders, Lana claims that the African-American Shameeka was put on the team to \\"fill our freak quota\\". Nevertheless, Shameeka becomes quite popular, apparently leaving Mia's group in books seven and eight while remaining on friendly terms, but returning in book nine when Lana and Trisha become friends with Mia. In book eleven, Mia mentions that she now works in marketing for Vera Wang. * Ling Su Wong: An Asian American artist friend of Mia's with illegible \\"artist handwriting\\". She admires Mia's mother Helen, mainly because they are both talented artists. Mia thinks she is very pretty; in the first book, she is apparently asked out seven times. In book seven, she is the treasurer for Mia's school government until they go broke. She concentrates more on academic matters rather than things such as prom and dating, though Mia likes her despite her nerdiness. In the tenth book, she goes to prom with Perin, and they become a couple by the eleventh book. * Prince Ren√© of Italy: First seen in the fourth novel, Ren√© is Mia's distant cousin. Clarisse tries to fix them up, but fails because of their mutual lack of interest. He is described as devilishly handsome; Mia notes that he has a \\"impressing\\" six-pack, accentuated by the tiny Speedos he enjoys wearing on the beach. His exploits include playing strip-tennis with a government official's wife, strip bowling with Lilly and the other royals, entertaining topless sunbathers in the pool house, disappearing with a prime minister's eighteen-year-old daughter, and photo-copying his nether-region in the palace administration office. After being deposed from his ancestral palace, which is bought by a shoe designer, Rene resides at the Palais de Genovia. In the ninth installment, Ren√© impregnates Contessa Trevanni's niece, Bella, and they are suddenly married; although the circumstances sound unfavorable, their marriage seems happy. In the tenth book, he runs against Mia's dad for Prime Minister of Genovia, but loses. * \\"Mamaw\\" Shirley Thermopolis and \\"Papaw\\" Thermopolis: Helen's mother and father from Versailles, Indiana, whom she constantly feuds with. Nevertheless, they keep in touch, and are portrayed in the second novel as perfect stereotypes of the \\"small-town\\" American lifestyle. Helen tries to contact them as little as possible, due to their disapproval of her decision to keep Mia and her liberal upbringing. * Hank Thermopolis: Mia's handsome cousin, who has spent most of his life in Indiana with his grandparents. When they visit Helen and Mia in Manhattan, he disappears with Lilly Moscovitz. Mia thinks they are in love, but he merely confesses to Lilly his secret desire to become a model, and Lilly helps him sign up with Elite Model Agency and land a contract with Calvin Klein. His Hoosier drawl then disappears. From then on, he stays in New York and becomes a famous underwear model. * Kenneth \\"Kenny\\" Showalter: Mia's first boyfriend. Kenny is good at biology and chemistry, and a fan of anime. He wants to discover a cure for cancer when he becomes older. It is hinted that his feelings for Mia are still romantic even after they break up. In book six, he pretends to have a \\"perfect\\" girlfriend named Heather, but later admits that he invented her to make Mia jealous. Kenny later forms a much more requited and equal relationship with Lilly, who is more similar to him than Mia is, and they end up going to Columbia together. Like Mia, Kenny is tall, blond and skinny, and Mia thinks he is pretty cute, but finds the idea of kissing him revolting. * Perin Thomas: A new student at AEHS introduced in book six. At first, Mia can't figure out whether Perin is a boy or a girl. She turns out to be a girl and eventually joins Mia's friend group, though she is again mistaken for a boy in Grandm√®re's musical, in which she is given a male role. Perin is one of Mia's 'nicer' friends, and is also surprisingly strong and well-mannered. In book ten, it is implied that Perin and Ling Su are romantically involved with each other, though this is not confirmed until the eleventh book, when they are shown running the Frank Gianini Community Center with Mia. * Trisha Hayes: Introduced in book six, one of Lana's cronies who helps terrorize Mia, but later befriends her at Lana's whim. Like Lana, Trisha is a pretty, popular mean girl, though Mia comments that Geometry teacher Mr. Harding once made her cry over her isosceles triangles. * Judith Gershner: A friend of Michael, whom Mia suspects of having romantic feelings for him. She later becomes the cause of Mia and Michael's breakup in book eight when it is revealed that he lost his virginity to her, but did not tell Mia about it. She is known for being able to clone fruit flies. * Karen Martinez: An overly critical English teacher who continually demands more from Mia's writing, though this may be an excuse to personally pick on Mia; Mia and J.P. decide that it is simply because she doesn't like their writing style. Tina thinks she is very pretty, comparing her to Maggie Gyllenhaal, and often comments on her clothes, but turns against her after Mrs. Martinez gives Mia a B in English in book six. Later, after Mia makes an awesome speech about why she should be elected student body president and is later elected, Mrs. Martinez congratulates Mia for her speech, saying she was right about popular culture having its place just like high culture; she then apologizes to Mia for making her feel that the things Mia enjoys writing about were less than more serious subjects, as they weren't. * Rocky Thermopolis-Gianini: Mia's half-brother, the son of her mother, Helen, and her algebra teacher, Mr. Gianini. Mia is incredibly over-protective of him, so much that Helen seems to be irritated that Mia thinks her mother is incapable of raising her second child. Lilly has also expressed that she thinks Mia is over-protective of him, repeatedly calling her a baby-licker in book six. Rocky is very cute but slightly overweight. * Sebastiano Grimaldi: Mia's second cousin, and second in line to the throne of Genovia after Mia. He is an up-and-coming fashion designer who designs some of Mia's gowns, and often has trouble pronouncing multi syllable words (example: \\"butt\\" instead of \\"butter\\"). He once took photos of Mia trying on dresses, but apologizes by making her a nice dress for the Non- denominational Winter Dance, which turns out to be the best night of Mia's life. In the tenth book, it is revealed that he becomes a famous fashion designer, and even has a line of jeans in Walmart. * Ruth and Morty Moscovitz: Michael and Lilly's parents, both psychoanalysts. They separate in book seven, but begin to rekindle their relationship in book eight. As shown in the seventh installment, they tend to focus too much on their own lives and concerns. When they do broach sensitive subjects with their children, they usually psychoanalyze them as well, a habit that has a very bad effect on Lilly, who inherits her intelligence and hobby of analyzing people from them. Michael, who is more perceptive, avoids their attention by keeping more to himself. *Olivia Grace Clarisse Mignonette Harrison Renaldo: First introduced in book eleven, Olivia is Mia's biracial 12-year-old half-sister, the daughter of Prince Philippe and Elizabeth, an American pilot. After her mother's death, she was raised by her aunt and uncle, who used Olivia's child support money for their personal means, and lives with them in Cranbrook, New Jersey, until Mia finds her. Like Mia, she keeps a diary which is used for the series spin- off, From the Notebooks of a Middle School Princess.

In New Zealand and Australia, the picture on the back features Georgia Byng instead of Cabot. She said, \\"Don't worry. The copies of Princess Diaries 7 with Georgia Byng's picture on the back were pulled from shops, and swapped for copies of the book with the correct author's photo (mine) on the back.\\" In December 2006, Cabot announced that a mistake had been made in the front cover summary of Valentine Princess. Since the book chronicles Mia glancing at her old diaries, the characters Boris and Tina were not dating, rather Boris and Lilly. On the book flap, however, it says Boris and Tina are a couple. Cabot has announced that this has been fixed by the publishing company. Tina was dating Dave Farouq El-Abar at the time of books one and two. In the tenth book (Forever Princess) Mia is writing a novel for her senior project, though she keeps it a secret from everyone but Michael, until the end of the book. At the end however she reveals this to Tina and J.P. Tina reads it instantly and thinks it is about Mia and Michael; J.P. doesn't read it and this upsets Mia, which is part of the reason they break up. At the end of the book, Mia receives an offer to get it published. (When Mia shares this news with Michael, they celebrate and this leads to a kiss, which proves that they are still in love.) Meg Cabot published \\"Mia's\\" book Ransom My Heart that can be bought in bookstores under the author name Princess of Genovia Mia Thermopolis.

Cabot has thanked the films many times in interviews and on her website because she believes that they helped boost her book sales, as well as making her the success that she is today. Meta-references * Mia makes references in- universe to a movie made about her life. These relate to changes made for the real movie adaptations, including her father's death, differences in Grandmere's character, and a break-up with Michael in the sequel. Lilly complains that in the movie, the portrayal of her is mean and untrue, and Tina Hakim Baba was not allowed to be in it as her overprotective father forbade it for security reasons. * Mia also makes references to the other Princess books: in the fourth book, Mia says that there are already three or four unofficial biographies out there, and that one made the bestseller list for a few seconds. The original The Princess Diaries novel did make the bestseller list. * The eighth novel mentions Samantha Madison and Jessica Mastriani, two heroines from other Meg Cabot books (All-American Girl and 1-800-Where-R-You, respectively).

Dedecius attended the Polish Stefan-≈ªeromski High School, where he received his high-school degree (Matura). After the German invasion of Poland in the Second World War, Dedecius was first drafted into the Reich Labor Service (Reichsarbeitsdienst) and then into the German Army. He was severely wounded in the Battle of Stalingrad and became a prisoner of war. During his time as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union, he taught himself Russian. Dedecius wrote, \\"I lay in my sick-bed, and the nurses brought me books by Lermontov, for instance. For one year, I learned the Cyrillic Alphabet and Russian by reading Lermontov and Pushkin. Eventually, the guards asked me to write love- letters for them, because I wrote like Pushkin\\". Dedecius in conversation with journalist Alina Perth-Grabowska, 1995 Dedecius was released in 1950. He settled at first with his fianc√© in Weimar, in East Germany. In 1952, he emigrated to West Germany and became an employee of the Allianz AG insurance company. In his free time, he occupied himself with Polish culture and with Polish literary translation, and maintained contact with Polish writers. Dedecius remarked ... \\"Only when I had gotten myself set up in life and enjoyed some stability was I able to turn to literature in a long-term and systematic way, although my career, you could say, had nothing whatever to do with writing.\\" In the introduction to the Polish edition of \\"On Translating,\\" Jerzy Kwiatkowski wrote: \\"Speaking formally, one could say that this translator‚Äôs great work came about on his evenings off, as a result of a hobby.\\" In 1959, he published his first anthology, Lektion der Stille (Lesson of Silence). In the following years, he translated, so to speak in his free time, such well-known Polish writers as Zbigniew Herbert, Stanis≈Çaw Jerzy Lec, Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, Tadeusz R√≥≈ºewicz and Wis≈Çawa Szymborska. He also published essays on literature and translating technique. In 1980, he initiated the German Poland Institute in Darmstadt.History page on the German Poland Institute site He served as the institute's director from 1980 through 1997. Meanwhile, continued his literary activities. Dedecius‚Äô main achievements were the 50-volume \\"Polish Library\\" canon, which appeared between 1982 and 2000 from the Suhrkamp Verlag publishing house and the 7-volume \\"Panorama of Polish Literature of the 20th Century\\" (1996‚Äì2000), whose final volume presented a kind of Dedecius autobiography. Dedecius died in Frankfurt, Germany on 26 February 2016 at the age of 94. Honors Dedecius received many honorary doctorates, prizes and awards. In 1967, he was awarded the Johann-Heinrich- Vo√ü-Preis f√ºr √úbersetzung. In 1990, he received the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels, in 1997 the Samuel-Bogumil-Linde-Preis.

Located on the now disused line between and , the station also had a shunting yard for the making-up of freight trains for and beyond. During its life it was also known at times as Thornton station and Thornton for Cleveleys station. In the 1860s and early 1870s the line was of great importance being the direct route from London to Glasgow. Before the Shap route was opened, passengers (allegedly including Queen Victoria) would travel from Euston to Fleetwood and then onwards via steamer to Scotland. The original station was opened in April 1865, and was named Cleveleys. It was to the south of Station Road in Thornton, near an older halt called Ramper Road. The Station Master's house and station building can still be seen in use as a private residence. The station was renamed Thornton for Cleveleys on 1 April 1905. This station closed in 1927 when the new station (the first to be built by the LMS) opened to the north of the level crossing. In February 1953, the station was renamed again, this time to Thornton‚ÄìCleveleys. Rationalised in the 1950s/'60s the station eventually closed on 1 June 1970 when the Fleetwood line was closed to passengers.Welch, M.S.

The station site today (and preservation)  The station from Station Road Level Crossing as of 2014 Today, the majority of the buildings at the station have long since been demolished but the platforms remain along with one of the original walls used to support the station's canopy and the bases for the waiting rooms on the up platform. The site of the main station buildings and bus turning circle are now the site of a supermarket and small shops, narrowing the original down platform by a small amount. On 1 July 2007, the station was leased by Network Rail to the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society to allow the group of volunteers access to the site to return the station to a restored condition. Extensive improvements have occurred since the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society have been working on the station, with the site cleared of vegetation and almost all the fences rebuilt in a traditional picket fence style; the society has recently begun resurfacing the down platform. In April 2013 the Poulton & Wyre Railway society were granted permission to extend their licence and begin work on the next station along the line towards Fleetwood at Burn Naze.

She was an opera singer with minor roles at the Metropolitan Opera and later became a stage actress, making her Broadway debut in 1906 and established herself as a character actor of the classical stage, also appearing in several films of the 1930s and 1940s. In addition to her many stage roles, which included Queen Gertrude opposite John Barrymore's Hamlet, she was an occasional director and playwright. She remained active in theater and film until the late 1960s. Her most famous film role was Madame Defarge in MGM's version of A Tale of Two Cities (1935), but she was also the compassionate aunt in The Song of Bernadette (1943). Another memorable role was as Zachary Scott's widowed mother in The Southerner (1945). Early life Born Blanch Jurka, apparently in St. Paul, Minnesota, she was the fourth of five children of Karol√≠na and Anton√≠n Jurka, ethnic Hungarian Roman Catholic emigrants from Bohemia. Her father was a teacher and librarian.ANTONIN JURKA, A PIONEER CZECH SCHOOLMASTER IN MINNESOTA; accessed April 1, 2015.Filby, P. William, ed. (2012). Passenger and Immigration Lists Index, 1500s-1900s. Gale Research. She inherited her father's artistic and scholarly interests, including a love of music and acting. She finished grade school before her father lost his job teaching Czech language at the Jefferson School in St. Paul. He found a new position with the Czech Benevolent Society in New York and moved the family to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1900. Her parents used their modest income to provide Blanche with singing lessons in New York even before she entered high school (1901‚Äì03). Her vocal talent attracted the admiration of composer and singer Harry Burleigh, and she won a scholarship at age 15 to study voice and ballet at the Metropolitan Opera School (1903‚Äì05). She appeared in an amateur Czech-language production of Michael William Balfe's The Bohemian Girl and made her Metropolitan Opera stage debut in the Christmas 1903 production of Wagner's Parsifal - the first staged performance of the opera outside of Bayreuth - appearing as a flower girl and as the Grail-bearer. In his review of the premiere performance, New York Tribune music critic Henry Krehbiel singled out her contribution: \\"And while pointing out the beauty of the work of the principals, it is a pleasant privilege to lay a wreath at the feet of the little lady who carried the Grail with such reverent and touching consecration to her sacred duties.\\" She continued her studies at the Met Opera School but was dismissed when she injured her voice singing the role of Leonora in Verdi's Il Trovatore in an amateur production. She transferred to the Institute for Musical Art (1905‚Äì07), forerunner of the Juilliard School but was dismissed from there for the same reason. Having lost her chance at an operatic career, she took the Institute director's suggestion and tried for a career on the theater stage. Through persistence, she managed to get an audition with the theater impresario David Belasco. According to her autobiography, he said to her: \\"Your diction is clear and pure. Your voice has good timbre. I can sense that you have temperament. We must find out if you can act.\\"Yurka, Blanche (1970). Bohemian Girl: Blanche Yurka's Theatrical Life. Ohio University Press, p. 37; . He gave her a bit part in The Rose of the Rancho (1906), and the following year, he extended her a contract, at which time she changed her surname to \\"Yurka\\", a homophone of her true surname. Stage career Beginning with The Warrens of Virginia (1907), Blanche spent the next decade alternating between stock and touring productions. In 1909, she had a small part in Leo Ditrichstein's Is Matrimony a Failure? at the Belasco Theater. There, she met actress Jane Cowl, who was starring in the production as Fanny Perry. Yurka had minor roles in several plays, including An Old New Yorker (1911), The House of Bondage (1914) Our American Cousin (1915) and a pair of plays by Jane Cowl, Daybreak (1917) and Information Please (1918). In 1922-23, she was Queen Gertrude to John Barrymore's Hamlet in Arthur Hopkins' production of Hamlet at the Sam Harris Theater and Manhattan Opera House, where it ran for a combined 125 performances. At 42, Barrymore was a little old to be playing her son (she was 35), and she made herself appear as youthful as possible to vent her irritation. Prior to Hamlet, she appeared in The Law Breaker, where she met a charming young character actor named Ian Keith (n√©e Keith Ross), who was 12 years her junior. They married in September 1922, her first marriage and his second. Her growing stature as an actress - combined with his jealousy - eventually came between them; they separated in 1925 and divorced in 1926. Yurka never remarried and had no children. Building on her repertoire of classic characters, Yurka starred in a quartet of Ibsen plays, directing three of them: The Wild Duck (1928, as Gina Ekdal), Hedda Gabler (1929, title role) and The Vikings (1930, as Hjordis); she also had the title role of Ellida in The Lady from the Sea (1929). In the year 1932 alone, she played the title role in Sophocles' Electra, was Helen of Troy in Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida, directed Carry Nation starring Esther Dale (a production that featured the Broadway debuts of Mildred Natwick and James Stewart) and appeared in Katharine Cornell's production of Lucrece by Deems Taylor and Thornton Wilder. She won critical acclaim in 1935 when she replaced Edith Evans as the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet opposite Cornell's Juliet. She co- adapted to stage the Spanish comedy, Spring in Autumn (1933) by Gregorio Mart√≠nez Sierra and Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez Sierra, which reunited her with Carry Nation co-stars Dale, Natwick and Stewart, and featured Yurka singing a Puccini aria while standing on her head.Davis, Andrew (2010). America's Longest Run: A History of the Walnut Street Theatre. Penn State University Press, p. 229; Film career Yurka was foremost a stage actress and for a long time considered film-making an inferior art form. Her low opinion of the movies started to change when she saw John Ford's The Informer, adapted from the novel by Liam O'Flaherty. When she finally made her belated screen debut at the age of 47, it was in the role that many consider the greatest of her film career, the poisonously vindictive revolutionary Th√©r√®se Defarge in A Tale of Two Cities. Producer David O. Selznick's first choice for the part of Madame Defarge was the Russian-born stage actress Alla Nazimova. When she turned it down, she recommended Yurka, declaring her the \\"only\\" actress for the part. The two women hadn't yet met but were well acquainted with one another's work inasmuch as they were the leading Ibsen heroines on the Broadway stage. Despite Nazimova's endorsement, Yurka was the 67th actor tested for the role. Yurka threw herself into the part ‚Äì quite literally. Her final fight scene with Edna May Oliver (who was only four years older than Yurka) showed the two actresses tumbling over tables and over the floor, offering a hint of Yurka's onstage physicality. Although not nominated for a best supporting actress Academy Award (the supporting categories weren't established until the following year), her character portrayal was a model of a sinister screen villain. In close-up, she flashed a look of steely malevolence; in her speech to the revolutionary tribunal ‚Äì asking for the conviction and execution of Charles Darnay ‚Äì she played it large and to the rafters. The film was only nominated in the Best Film and Best Editing categories, not even its star, Ronald Colman getting an Oscar nod. She sought to play O-Lan in the 1937 film The Good Earth but lost out to Luise Rainer, who won an Academy Award for her performance. She also lost the role of Pilar in For Whom the Bell Tolls to Greek actress Katina Paxinou, who went on to win an Oscar for best supporting actress. Her follow-up to A Tale of Two Cities was the lead in a B movie shoot-'em-up, Queen of the Mob (1940), in which Yurka played a gangster matriarch closely based on the contemporary outlaw, Ma Barker. Her severe, vaguely imperious looks led to her casting in a rogue's gallery of austere or villainous parts. Through the 1940s and with decreasing frequency in the 1950s, she appeared in a succession of B parts that wasted her talents, occasionally landing supporting character parts in A list movies. Among the latter were The Song of Bernadette (1943) ‚Äì again for David O. Selznick ‚Äì in which she played Jennifer Jones' aunt and The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1944), as the Abbess of San Luis Rey chapel. Notably, one of her co-stars in the latter film was Alla Nazimova (who had suggested Yurka's casting as Madame Defarge) playing the Marquessa Do√±a Maria. In The Southerner (1945), an American frontier drama directed by Jean Renoir, Yurka's Mama Tucker was the widowed daughter-in-law of cantankerous Granny Tucker played by Beulah Bondi. Radio career Yurka had the role of Mrs. Hunter in the soap opera Valiant Lady. Post-War years Yurka never left the theater, but as her Hollywood roles became less satisfying after the war, the pace of both her film and stage roles fell off. During World War II, she contributed her time and talent to the war effort as a theater performer. She toured with theater troupes in Europe both before and after the war. In December, 1945, she appeared at the Majestic Theatre for two readings of Sophocles' Oedipus Rex with classics scholar Eugene O'Neill, Jr. Yurka was active in theater causes all her life. She supported the 1919 actors' strike. She later vigorously defended the interests of American actors against a British invasion of American theaters. She aligned herself with Tallulah Bankhead's defense of the Federal Theater Project at the 1939 Senate Appropriations Committee hearings that de-funded the program in reaction to productions that were deemed sympathetic to the political left-wing. On occasion, she could be critical of Broadway for production values which did not live up to the highest standards. In a letter to the New York Times, published November 6, 1955, she reproached the theater community's \\"passion for ugliness that seems so much a part of our theater today.\\" Before the year was over, she announced her retirement from the stage ‚Äì a short-lived retirement that would find her back onstage exactly a year later in the Phoenix Theatre's Diary of a Scoundrel. In 1957, she visited Athens under the aegis of the United States International Exchange of Artists to open the Greek Drama Festival. There, she appeared in a reading of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound in the translation by Edith Hamilton. In 1958, she appeared at the Belasco Theater in Huntington Hartford's Jane Eyre. In the last 15 years of her life, few stage or film roles came her way. She appeared sporadically in television shows in the '50s, notably, Lux Video Theater, The Philip Morris Playhouse and Ponds Theater. She was shocked at being offered the brief role of Mrs. Wendell the cook in the cancelled MGM remake of Dinner at Eight (1969) ‚Äì the role played by May Robson in the 1933 film. She concluded her career on a note of personal triumph with her critically acclaimed London performance as The Madwoman of Chaillot (1969). When the play traveled to off-Broadway in 1970, the New York critics' reception was lukewarm, and Yurka retired from acting soon after the show closed. Death Blanche Yurka Yurka collected her thoughts about acting technique in the book Dear Audience (1959) and wrote a memoir, Bohemian Girl (1970). She was a popular guest at women's clubs and colleges, where she continued to perform dramatic readings. She suffered from failing health in her final years owing to arteriosclerosis and died June 6, 1974, about two weeks before her 87th birthday. She was interred in the same burial plot with her good friend, actress Florence Reed, in the Actors Fund of America section of Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.

Biography Lucas was born on September 5, 1857, in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the twelfth and youngest child of James H. Lucas and Marie Emilie (Desruisseaux) Lucas. When his father died in 1873, Henry Lucas inherited $2 million of his $9 million estate. He lived on an estate just outside of the city of St. Louis (now part of the present-day town of Normandy, Illinois) and was educated at Saint Louis University. An all-around sports enthusiast, he enjoyed baseball both as a participant and as a spectator. With the support of other St. Louis investors, in November 1883, Lucas filed papers to incorporate the St. Louis Athletic Association, giving birth to the St. Louis Maroons. In 1884, the 26-year-old Henry became president of the Union Association, a professional baseball major league that operated for only a single season. After the Union Association collapsed, the National League was persuaded to bring the Maroons into the established league, to try to provide some competition for the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. Unfortunately for the Maroons, the Browns were at the peak of their game, winning pennants four straight years (1885‚Äì1888). Meanwhile, the Maroons, facing much better competition in the National League, finished well off the National League pace in 1885 and 1886. Following the 1886 season, the Maroons were sold to the league, which in turn sold it to John T. Brush. Brush moved the team to Indianapolis, where they were renamed the Hoosiers.Cash, John David. Before They Were Cardinals: Major League Baseball in Nineteenth-Century St. Louis. University of Missouri Press, 2002, , p. 107. The Hoosiers folded following the 1889 season. Of Lucas, it was noted that \\"during the next few years he turned up at a ballpark or otherwise hinted that he might like to return to the game\\", but he had to settle instead for employment as a railway clerk with the Vandalia Railroad.

Early life Summerville was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where his mother died when he was only five. Moving from New Mexico to Canada and later to Oklahoma, he had a nomadic upbringing. In Canada, in Chatham, Ontario, he lived with his English grandparents and obtained his first job there, working as a messenger for the Canadian Pacific Telegraphs. Film career Slim Summerville inscribed photo The beginning of Summerville's three-decade screen career can be traced to another early job he had, one working in a poolroom in California. There in 1912 he met actor Edgar Kennedy, who took him to see Mack Sennett, the head of Keystone Studios in Edendale. Sennett immediately hired him for $3.50 per day to perform in bit parts, his first being in the role of a \\"Keystone Kop\\" in the short Hoffmeyer's Legacy. Tall and gangly, Summerville used his physical appearance to great effect in many comedies during both the silent and sound eras. His work in films, however, was not limited to acting; he also directed more than 50 productions, mostly shorts. Her First Kiss (1919) with Ethel Teare Occasionally, Summerville played in dramatic films, such as All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) and Jesse James (1939), but he was most successful in comedies, including several with ZaSu Pitts. He also performed with child star Shirley Temple in the musical-comedy dramas Captain January (1936) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938). Personal life Summerville married Gertrude Martha Roell on 19 November 1927. Five years later they adopted a four-week-old baby boy whom they christened Elliott George. The couple divorced in September 1936, and the following year Summerville married Eleanor Brown, a nurse who had cared for him while he was sick. Summerville died of a stroke on January 5, 1946 in Laguna Beach, California. He is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in South Los Angeles community of Inglewood, California. Two decades after his death, his beach-front house on Sleepy Hollow Lane in Laguna Beach was converted into the Beach House restaurant, which was later renamed the Driftwood Kitchen.

Some of the more important offices are unique to it. Titles Ethiopian ecclesiastical titles include: *Patriarch we Re'ese Liqane Papasat ‚Äî Patriarch and First of the Archbishop, meaning Catholicos. Since 1959, the title of the head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church is Patriarch Catholicos of Ethiopia. The first Patriarch, Abuna Basilios was enthroned by the Coptic Orthodox Pope Cyril VI in 1959, and so the Patriarchs of Ethiopia are part of the Apostolic succession of the Holy See of St. Mark. The Ethiopian Patriarchate combined the old offices of Abuna and Ichege (see below). In 2001, the title of Archbishop of Axum was added to the titles of the Patriarch after Axum was elevated to the rank of an Archdiocese by the Holy Synod. * Abuna ‚Äî Metropolitan Archbishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. From the 4th century until the middle of the 20th century he was a Coptic Metropolitan appointed by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa to serve as its leader. However, as time passed, the authority of the Abuna was reduced to little more than a figurehead largely because the incumbents spoke little Ge'ez or Amharic. In 1948, the Coptic Orthodox Pope Joseph II under request from Emperor Haile Selassie I, appointed the then Ichege (see below) as the first Ethiopian born Archbishop, Abuna Basilios, and granted the Ethiopian church autocephaly. His successor as Coptic Orthodox Pope, Cyril VI, elevated Abune Basilios to the exalted rank of Patriarch in 1959. The title of Abuna is now held by all the numerous Archbishops and Bishops of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. * Ichege ‚Äî the abbot of the monastery of Debre Libanos, who served as the second highest ecclesiastic of the Ethiopian church, and was often the de facto head of that church.Munro-Hay, Ethiopia, pp. 42f Margary Perham describes the position as comparable to a Vicar-General.Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), p. 108 Beginning in the mid-17th century, the Ichege lived at Gondar while the capital was in that city. The Ichege followed the capital when it moved to Debre Tabor, Mekele and ultimately Addis Ababa. * Sebate ‚Äî Administrator of the Debre Libanos Monastery and deputy to the Ichege. * Aqabe sa'at (\\"Guardian of the Church hours\\") -- Chaplain to the Emperor, who served as the third highest ecclesiastic. In earlier times, this office was held by the head of the abbots of Istifanos Monastery in Lake Hayq; the earliest recorded abbot of Istifanos to also serve as aqabe sa'at was Za-Iyasus during the reign of Amda Seyon I. This office is extinct. * Qomos ‚Äî Canon, who has a role in the creation of tabots.Munro-Hay, Ethiopia, p. 50 * Lique Siltanat' ‚Äî \\"Arch-hierarch\\" title originally granted only to the Dean of Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, but today is granted to the deans of most of Ethiopia's cathedrals. * Lique Liqawint ‚Äî \\"Arch-scholar\\", head of all clergy in a province.Perham, Government, p. 109 This title was granted to the Dean and Abbot of the Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery, the mausoleum church on the grounds of Addis Ababa's Imperial Palace, where Emperor Menelik II and Empress Zewditu are buried. * Qess-Priest.

Board of Education, which struck down religious education in public schools. The defendant in the case was the public school district of Champaign, Illinois; instructors chosen by three religious faiths had taught religion classes within the district's schools. McCollum wrote a book on the case, One Woman's Fight (1953), became a world traveler and served two terms as president of the American Humanist Association from 1962‚Äì1965. She was also a signer of the Humanist Manifesto II in October 1973 and the Humanist Manifesto III in 2003. In 1948 McCollum told The New York Times \\"As long as the public school is used to recruit the child or to segregate the children according to religion or to use the truancy power of the public schools to make them go to religions classes, I'm against it\\". Early life Named after the Old Testament feminist Queen Vashti and born as Vashti Ruth Cromwell in Lyons, New York, she was raised in nearby Rochester, New York. Baptized Lutheran, she was not raised in any religion and her father later became an atheist. She attended Cornell University on a full tuition scholarship until the stock market crash and deepening economic depression depleted the scholarship fund and forced her to withdraw from Cornell. She later transferred to the University of Illinois. Family She met her husband-to-be, John Paschal McCollum, at Champaign- Urbana, and the couple married in 1933. The McCollums had three children: James, Dannel, and Errol. Dannel McCollum later served three four-year terms as mayor of Champaign, Illinois and wrote a book on the case that became the basis for a PBS documentary, The Lord Is Not on Trial Here. Activism In 1944, James McCollum, then a fourth grader enrolled in the Champaign public schools, came home with a parental consent form for his attendance at \\"voluntary\\" religion classes during the school day. The form allowed choice between Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish instruction. The religious education program in the Champaign public schools had been established in 1940, and was based on a concept known as released time. Released time was also known as the \\"Gary plan,\\" after Gary, Indiana, where the concept was devised in 1914. The released time concept allowed children to be released from public school to attend religious instruction at their house of worship. In the released time system in Champaign, a clergyman or layperson from each of the three represented religious faiths taught the religion classes in the public schools for 30 minutes each week. With some reluctance, the McCollums allowed their eight-year-old son to attend the Champaign school district's Protestant religious course during his fourth grade year, but after reviewing the course materials, they withdrew permission for James's participation for the following year, based on their belief that the content of Champaign's religion classes was inappropriate for the public schools. James ‚Äì the only student in his class not participating in the religion class ‚Äì was subsequently pressured by his teachers to conform, and his parents were pressured by school officials to permit him to join the religion classes to help James \\"get along.\\" The McCollums were angered at their son's ostracism by his teachers, which included James's being forced to sit alone in a hallway while the other pupils attended religion classes. After a meeting with school officials which failed to change the school district's policy, McCollum filed suit against Champaign's school district in July 1945. Lawsuit McCollum's suit, Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., was filed in the 6th judicial circuit court and sought to bar the classes, which were taught by members of a private religious association and not public school employees. The petition before the court complained the school district's practice was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which provides that the state will not establish or favor one religion over another religion, or disallow the practice of any religion, and also the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees that the law will apply equally to all people. On September 10, 1945, the opening argument by McCollum's attorney, Landon Chapman, suggested the program was sectarian and social pressure from students and teachers was used to get all students to participate. Defense attorney John Franklin indicated similar programs existed in 46 states and 80 Illinois communities. The Baptist Joint Committee submitted an amicus brief in support of McCollum, saying, \\"We must not allow our religious fervor to blind us to the essential fact that no religious faith is secure when it meshes its authority with that of the state.\\" On the first day of the trial, a Bible-carrying man is said to have approached the school board's attorney and announced that he was there to testify for the Lord. Franklin turned to him and replied, ‚ÄúThe Lord, sir, is not on trial here today.‚Äù This quote was the source for the title of Dan McCollum's book on his mother's experience as well as the title of Jay Rosenstein's 2011 PBS documentary. McCollum's father, Arthur Cromwell, testified in the original trial and elicited a gasp from the crowd when he said he did not believe in God. Both Cromwell and ten-year-old James McCollum \\"affirmed\\" that they would tell the truth in lieu of swearing by God. In another key testimony, Rev. Alva R Cartlidge, president of the Champaign school council for religious education, explained that the program had grown out of spontaneous demand caused by increasing juvenile delinquency. The county circuit court ruled against McCollum and was subsequently upheld in fall 1946 by the Illinois Supreme Court upon appeal. = Impact on family = During the three-year legal battle, Mrs. McCollum received physical threats and was fired from her job as a dance instructor at the university. At Halloween, a mob of trick-or-treaters pelted the McCollum family with rotten tomatoes and cabbages. The family cat was killed. According to McCollum most of the $25,000 cost of her lawsuit was underwritten by the Chicago Action Council, although $4,000 was paid by the family and $1,000 came from many private donations ranging from 25 cents to $100. Appeal On June 2, 1947, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, and arguments started December 8, 1947. Attorney Walter F. Dodd represented the plaintiff and John L. Franklin again served as counsel for the State of Illinois. In an 8-1 decision announced on March 8, 1948 , the court reversed the ruling of the lower courts and held that the school district's religious instruction program was unconstitutional. A critical issue in the case was whether the constitutional ban on establishing religion meant that all sects must be treated equally, as lawyers for Champaign argued was the case in their schools, or whether it required strict neutrality between belief and unbelief, which was Mrs. McCollum's successful contention. \\"The First Amendment rests upon the premise that both religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other in its respective sphere,\\" Justice Black wrote. The case was also important because it extended First Amendment protection to individual states by using the due process clause of the 14th Amendment as a justification. All other cases that have since tested and continue to test Thomas Jefferson's wall of \\"separation of church and state,\\" including school prayer, aid to parochial schools and sectarian religious displays on public property descend from this case.

He was Bishop of Hereford, 1918‚Äì20 and Bishop of Durham, 1920‚Äì39. The son of a zealous member of the Plymouth Brethren, Henson was not allowed to go to school until he was fourteen, and was largely self-educated. He was admitted to the University of Oxford, and gained a first-class degree in 1884. In the same year he was elected as a Fellow of All Souls, where he began to make a reputation as a speaker. He was ordained as a priest in 1888. Feeling a vocation to minister to the urban poor, Henson served in the East End of London and Barking before becoming chaplain of an ancient hospice in Ilford in 1895. In 1900 he was appointed to the high-profile post of vicar of St Margaret's, Westminster and canon of Westminster Abbey. While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913‚Äì18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially. The Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church took exception to his liberal theological views, which some regarded as heretical, and sought unsuccessfully in 1917 to block his appointment as Bishop of Hereford. In 1920, after two years in the largely rural diocese of Hereford, Henson returned to Durham as its bishop. The industrial north-east of England, including County Durham, was badly affected by an economic depression. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and socialism, and for a time his forthright expression of his views made him unpopular in the diocese. His opinions about some Church matters changed radically during his career: at first a strong advocate of the Church of England's continued establishment as the country's official church, he came to believe that politicians could not be trusted to legislate properly on ecclesiastical matters, and he espoused the cause of disestablishment. He campaigned against efforts to introduce prohibition, exploitation of foreign workers by British companies, and fascist and Nazi aggression, and supported reform of the divorce laws, a controversial revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism. Life and career =Early years= Henson was born in London, the fourth son and sixth child of eight of Thomas Henson (1812‚Äì1896), a businessman, and his second wife, Martha, n√©e Fear.Peart-Binns, p. 17 The family moved to Broadstairs on the coast of Kent when Henson was two years old. Thomas Henson was a zealous evangelical Christian who had renounced the Church of England and joined the Plymouth Brethren. Martha Henson shielded her children from the worst excesses of what the biographer Matthew Grimley describes as Thomas's \\"bigotry\\",Grimley, Matthew. 2011 \\"Henson, Herbert Hensley (1863‚Äì1947)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 4 November 2014 but in 1870 she died, and, in Henson's words, \\"with her died our happiness\\".Henson (1942), p. 3 From an early age the young Henson was a dedicated Christian and felt a vocation for the Anglican priesthood; his father's fundamentalist views were anathema, and left him with what Grimley calls \\"an enduring hatred of protestant fanaticism\\". In 1873 Thomas Henson remarried; Emma Parker, widow of a Lutheran pastor, filled the role of stepmother with sympathy and kindness, mitigating the father's grimness and ensuring that the children were properly educated. In Henson's phrase, \\"she recreated the home\\". Henson was fourteen before his father allowed him either to be baptised or to attend a school.Chadwick, p. 6 The Rector of Broadstairs conducted the baptism; there were no godparents, and Henson undertook their functions himself.Peart-Binns, p. 19 He took religious instruction from the rector leading to his confirmation as a communicant member of the Church of England in 1878.Peart-Binns, p. 20 At Broadstairs Collegiate School he derived little educational benefit, having already educated himself widely and deeply from books in his father's library. He rose to be head boy of the school, but after a dispute with the headmaster during which Henson expressed \\"with more passion than respect\\" his opinion of the head, he ran away from the school in 1879.Henson (1950), p. 358 He gained employment as an assistant master at Brigg Grammar School in Lincolnshire; the headmaster there recognised his talent and recommended that he should apply for admission to the University of Oxford. Thomas Henson was against the idea, partly because his financial means had declined, but was talked round by his wife and gave his consent. Thomas agreed to fund his son's studies, but the sum he allowed was too little to pay the substantial fees for residence at any of the colleges of the university. In 1881 Henson applied successfully for admission as an unattached student, a member of none of the Oxford colleges, but eligible for the full range of university tuition.Chadwick, p. 16 Cut off from the camaraderie of college life, Henson felt seriously isolated. He concentrated on his studies, and gained a first class honours degree in Modern History in June 1884.Peart-Binns, pp. 21‚Äì22 =All Souls= Sir William Anson (top), William Rathbone, and Charles Gore Such was the quality of Henson's scholarship that his history tutor encouraged him to enter the annual competition for appointment as a Fellow of All Souls, the university's post- graduate research college.Chadwick, p. 21 He was appointed in November 1884, at the age of twenty. Membership of the college offered an annual stipend of ¬£200; for the first time, Henson was in reasonably comfortable financial circumstances. At All Souls, he later wrote, \\"I was welcomed with a generous kindness which made me feel immediately at home. I formed friendships which have enriched my life.\\"Henson (1942), p. 5 His biographer John Peart-Binns suggests that Henson may nonetheless have remained something of an outsider, his arrival at All Souls \\"akin to that of an alien\\". The college was headed by the Warden, Sir William Anson, who became something of a father figure to Henson, and encouraged his researches.Chadwick, p. 24 Henson's first paper, on William II of England, marked him out as not only a fine scholar but a gripping speaker when he delivered it to an audience.Peart-Binns, p. 24 Aware that his quick tongue could lead him into indiscretion, he adopted and maintained all his life the practice of writing out his lectures and sermons in full beforehand rather than improvising or speaking from concise notes.Chadwick, p. 279 He preferred a quill pen, and wrote in a fine clear hand; he considered illegible writing to be a form of bad manners as tiresome as inaudible talking.Lyttelton‚ÄìHart-Davis, p. 25 He gained a reputation as a controversialist. In a biographical sketch, Harold Begbie wrote that at Oxford Henson was nicknamed \\"Coxley Cocksure\\"; he added: In 1885, in tandem with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic businessman William Rathbone.Chadwick, p. 28 The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and with his hand on the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.Peart-Binns, pp. 25‚Äì26; and Chadwick, p. 29 Henson's beliefs on doctrine were still forming, but he inclined to high- churchmanship and was influenced by Charles Gore and the Puseyites, though he was unattracted by more extreme Anglo-Catholic forms of ritualism. With his suspicion of nonconformism he was a proponent of the principle of establishment ‚Äì the maintenance of Anglicanism as the official state religion ‚Äì and in 1886 he became secretary of the new Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church, to counter the threat of disestablishment proposed by politicians such as Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Dilke.Henson, H Hensley. \\"The Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church\\", The Times, 13 August 1886, p. 6; and \\"Election Intelligence\\", The Times, 17 November 1885, p. 7 =Ordination and east London= The poverty Henson had seen during his six months in Birkenhead gave him a strong impetus to minister to the poor.Chadwick, p. 29 In 1887, after being ordained deacon, he took charge of the Oxford House Settlement, a high-church mission in Bethnal Green, a poor area of the East End of London.Chadwick, pp. 40‚Äì41 While in this post he honed his speaking skills in public debates with atheist orators, many from the National Secular Society's Bethnal Green office.Peart-Binns, p. 41; and Chadwick, p. 44 St Margaret's, Barking, Henson's first parish In 1888 Henson was ordained priest.Peart-Binns, p. 38 Shortly afterwards All Souls appointed him vicar of a church in its gift: St Margaret's, Barking, in east London, a large, working class parish, with a population of 12,000, and increasing.\\"Restoration of Barking Church\\", The Times, 25 May 1889, p. 17Williams, Alwyn. \\"Henson, Herbert Hensley\\", Dictionary of National Biography archive, Oxford University Press, 1959. Retrieved 6 November 2014 At twenty- five he was the youngest vicar in the country, and had a large staff of curates to manage.\\"Bishop Hensley Henson ‚Äì Master of Dialectic\\", The Times, 29 September 1947, p. 27 An All Souls colleague Cosmo Lang, himself on the brink of a Church career, visited Henson at Barking and noted, \\"He came six months ago to a parish dead ‚Äì 250 a good congregation in the church; and now, when he preaches, every seat is filled ‚Äì 1100!\\"Lockhart, p. 76 With the energy and impetuosity noted by Lang, Henson worked continually over the next seven years to improve the parish, restoring the fabric of the church, opening clubs for his parishioners, and holding popular open-air services in the vicarage grounds.Peart-Binns, p. 41 At Barking his high-church leanings were welcomed, and he was invited to preach from time to time at St Alban's Holborn, a central London bastion of Anglo-Catholicism. He was never physically strong, and his relentless work at Barking put a strain on his physique. In 1895 he accepted an offer from Lord Salisbury of a less arduous post, the chaplaincy of St Mary's Hospital, Ilford, which he held until 1900. In 1895 and 1896, Henson was select preacher at Oxford, and from 1897 he served as chaplain to John Festing, Bishop of St Albans.\\"Henson, Rt Rev Herbert Hensley\\", Who Was Who, Oxford University Press, 2014. Retrieved 6 November 2014 He had time for writing; between 1897 and 1900 he published four books, ranging from purely theological studies to analyses of Church politics. His beliefs had changed from his early high-churchmanship to a broad-church latitudinarianism; his 1899 Cui bono? set out his concerns about the strict ritualists in the Anglo- Catholic wing of the Church.Chadwick, pp. 80‚Äì81 =Westminster= St Margaret's The Ilford appointment had been in Salisbury's personal gift; in his official capacity as prime minister he was responsible for Henson's next appointment: rector of St Margaret's, Westminster and canon of Westminster Abbey in 1900. St Margaret's, the parish church of the British parliament, was a high-profile appointment; Henson followed predecessors as willing as he was to court controversy including Henry Hart Milman and Frederic Farrar.Smyth, pp. 165‚Äì168, 170‚Äì172 and 214 His eventual successor as Bishop of Durham, Alwyn Williams wrote that at St Margaret's, Henson's brilliance as a speaker and independence of thought attracted large congregations and \\"his increasingly liberal churchmanship\\" appealed to a wide range of public opinion, though some of his views offended the orthodox. In October 1902 at Westminster Abbey Henson married Isabella (Ella) Caroline (1870‚Äì1949), the only daughter of James Wallis Dennistoun of Dennistoun, Scotland. Grimley comments that it was in keeping with Henson's usual impulsiveness that he proposed within four days of meeting her. The marriage was lifelong; there were no children. Caricatured by Wallace Hester in Vanity Fair, 1912 From his pulpit, Henson spoke against the view that ecumenism was, in W E Gladstone's words, \\"a moral monster\\", and criticised schools that failed to provide adequate religious instruction.\\"Canon Henson on Fundamental Christianity\\", The Times, 5 March 1906, p. 14 Preaching at Westminster Abbey in 1912 he attracted international attention for naming and denouncing three British directors of the Peruvian- Amazon Company for the \\"Putumayo atrocities\\" ‚Äì the mass enslavement and brutal treatment of indigenous Peruvians in the company's rubber factories.\\"Rubber Directors Assail Canon Henson\\", The New York Times, 25 August 1912 ; \\"Putumayo Atrocities\\", The Times, 5 August 1912, p. 6 During his time at St Margaret's Henson published nine books, some of them collected sermons and lectures, others on the role of Christianity in modern society and theological questions. Henson's uncompromising character brought him into frequent conflict with old friends and colleagues. In 1909 he offended Charles Gore, now Bishop of Birmingham, by defying Gore's order not to preach in the institute of a Congregational church in the diocese. His confrontational style and liberal theology caused delay in his promotion, despite his obvious abilities. An apocryphal story circulated in 1908 that the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, suggested Henson's name to Edward VII when the see of York became vacant, and the king replied, \\"Damn it all, man, I am Defender of the Faith!\\"Buckler, F W. \\"The Church of England by Herbert Hensley Henson\\", Church History, September 1940, pp. 277‚Äì278 In 1910 the post of Dean of Lincoln fell vacant. Asquith considered appointing Henson, but decided, as he told the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, that \\"it would be rather like sending a destroyer into a land-locked pool\\". =Dean and bishop= Durham Cathedral In 1912 the Dean of Durham, George Kitchin, died. The Bishop, Handley Moule, hoped the prime minister would appoint Henry Watkins, the Archdeacon of Durham, but Asquith chose Henson.Peart-Binns, p. 69 On 2 January 1913 Moule presided over Henson's formal installation at Durham Cathedral.\\"Ecclesiastical Intelligence\\", The Times, 3 January 1913, p. 2 The five years Henson spent as Dean of Durham were marked by further controversy, including his objection to the existing divorce laws as too favourable to men and unfair to women.Peart-Binns, p. 65 He was hostile to changes aimed at giving the Church more control over its own affairs; he regarded establishment and parliamentary control as safeguards against extremism. He opposed William Temple's \\"Life and Liberty movement\\", which campaigned for synodical and democratic government of the Church, and he was against the establishment of the National Assembly of the Church of England in 1919.Peart-Binns, pp. 82‚Äì84 and 100 To Henson, the essence of Anglicanism rested on parliamentary enforcement of the rights of the laity of the Church against the bishops and priests, and the inclusion of both clergy and laity in all matters under the rule of the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church. Among other views for which Henson was known were his disapproval of teetotalism campaigners and of socialism, and for his disbelief in social reform as an ally of religion.\\"Dean Hensley Henson\\", The Manchester Guardian, 13 December 1917, p. 4 When the Kikuyu controversy erupted in 1913 Henson once again found himself at odds with Gore. The question was whether two colonial bishops had committed heresy by taking part in an ecumenical service. Gore and his ally Bishop Weston of Zanzibar led the charge, and appear in Henson's journal as \\"devoted, unselfish, indefatigable, eminently gifted, but ... also fanatical in temper, bigoted in their beliefs, and reckless in their methods.\\"Henson, 1943, p. 159 Together with Bishop Moule, Dean Wace of Canterbury and other leaders, Henson strongly, and successfully, supported the accused bishops: \\"The Church owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Bishops of Uganda and Mombasa.\\"\\"'Heresy' and Possible Schism in the Church of England: Figures in the Vital Kikuyu Controversy\\", Illustrated London News 10 January 1914, pp. 54‚Äì55 Henson spoke out strongly, and ultimately unsuccessfully, against the proposed disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales.Peart-Binns, p. 70 In doing so he addressed many nonconformist gatherings; the historian Owen Chadwick suggests that this may have commended him to David Lloyd George, who became prime minister in 1916. A serious doctrinal row within the Church seemed to many to put Henson out of the running for elevation to a bishopric. He had defended the right of clergy to express doubts about the virgin birth and bodily resurrection. He was, as most of his critics failed, or refused, to notice, doctrinally orthodox on the resurrection, and content to accept the tradition of the virgin birth,Peart-Binns, p. 68 but his contention that other priests had the right to question them was intolerable to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church, led by Gore. Hereford Cathedral Archbishop Davidson had no doubts about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and persuaded him to issue a statement of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith.Bishopric of Hereford: The Primate's Attitude The Manchester Guardian, 18 January 1918, p. 5 Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times.\\"Christian Reunion\\", The Times, 18 December 1917, p. 9 Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops.\\"Bishop of Hereford Consecrated\\", The Times, 4 February 1918, p. 2 He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.\\"Dr Henson at Hereford\\", 'The Times', 13 February 1918, p. 3 Although Henson's elevation was controversial chiefly among factions of the clergy ‚Äì in general lay people supported his appointment ‚Äì it nevertheless gave fresh impetus to the idea of taking away from the prime minister the power to choose bishops.Chadwick, p. 145 Gore attempted to promote the idea at the Convocation of Clergy in May 1918; Henson abandoned restraint and in Chadwick's words \\"stripped Gore's arguments bare\\".Chadwick, p. 147 He argued from historical examples that appointments made at the Church's instigation were partisan and disastrous, and that the Crown and prime minister were able to take an unbiased view in the national interest. Despite the public support for him, the controversy revived Henson's feelings of isolation.Chadwick, p. 150 The appointment was described as \\"sending an armoured car into an orchard of apple trees\\" and Henson had doubts about accepting a mainly rural diocese rather than ministering to the urban poor.Chadwick, pp. 113 and 133 Nevertheless, the clergy and laity of Hereford gave him a warm welcome, and he enjoyed working with the incumbents of country parishes. They appreciated his delicacy in not intruding unduly into local church concerns, and it was remarked that \\"he treated all the world as his equals\\".Chadwick, p. 154 During his brief time at Hereford he published only one book, Christian Liberty (1918), a collection of sermons. Henson was an active Freemason. At Hereford, he and the dean, Reginald Waterfield, were among the founders of a new masonic lodge in 1920.\\"Cantilupe Lodge\\", Masonic Province of Herefordshire. Retrieved 9 July 2018 Peart-Binns describes him as enjoying the meetings of his various lodges, but finding the associated social activities \\"intolerable\\". Henson was outspoken as an apologist for Freemasonry, promoting its ideals, and its religious foundations.Peart-Binns, p. 114 There was regret in the diocese that Henson's tenure there was brief. In 1920 the see of Durham became vacant on the death of Bishop Moule. Davidson wanted Thomas Strong, Dean of Christ Church, to be appointed and pressed his claims on Lloyd George, but the prime minister took the view that the area needed Henson's practical skills and common touch rather than Strong's academic scholarship.Peart-Binns, p. 109; and Chadwick, p. 155 =Durham= Henson was translated to Durham ‚Äì England's most senior diocese after Canterbury, York and LondonWhitaker, p. 235 ‚Äì in October 1920.\\"Bishop Henson Enthroned\\", The Times, 1 November 1920, p. 15 The appointment was challenging: the area was in grave economic difficulty, with the important coal-mining industry in a crisis caused by falling industrial demand for coal in the years after the war. Ecclesiastically there was potential for friction, as the Dean of Durham, James Welldon, who had once been a bishop himself, was temperamentally and politically at odds with his new superior, given to making public statements that Henson found infuriating. Welldon, in Henson's view, \\"could neither speak with effect nor be silent with dignity\\".Lyttelton‚ÄìHart- Davis, pp. 17‚Äì18 They clashed on several occasions, most conspicuously when Welldon, a strong admirer of prohibition, publicly criticised Henson's tolerant views on the consumption of alcohol.Peart-Binns, p. 124 Relations between the Deanery and Auckland Castle, the bishop's official residence, improved markedly in April 1933 when Cyril Alington, the Head Master of Eton from 1917 to 1933, succeeded Welldon.\\"New Dean of Durham\\", The Times, 3 May 1933, p. 14 Alington was almost universally loved, and though he and Henson differed on points of ecclesiastical practice, they remained warm friends.Chadwick, p. 297 Durham coal mine in 1920 At the beginning of Henson's episcopate the Durham miners were on strike. He got on well with miners individually and conversed with many of them as they walked through the extensive grounds of Auckland Castle. It was said of him that he got on easily with everyone \\"except other dignitaries in gaiters\\".Chadwick, p. 157 Friction arose from Henson's belief that strikes were morally wrong because of the harm they did to other working people,Chadwick, p. 161 and he had, in Grimley's words, \\"a violent, almost obsessional\\", dislike of trade unions. His early concern for the welfare of the poor remained unchanged, but he regarded socialism and trade unionism as negations of individuality. For the same reason he was against state provision of social welfare, though a strong advocate of voluntary spending on it. Later in his bishopric Henson denounced the Jarrow March in 1936 as \\"revolutionary mob pressure\\" and condemned the action of his subordinate, the suffragan Bishop of Jarrow, who had given the march his blessing.Bartley, p. 89 He loathed class distinction, and was not antipathetic to social reformers, but he was strong in his criticism of Christian campaigners who maintained that the first duty of the Church was social reform. To Henson, the Church's principal concern was each individual man or woman's spiritual welfare.Chadwick, p. 162 Cosmo Lang in 1922 The best- known anecdote of Henson, according to Chadwick, comes from his time at Durham. Cosmo Lang complained that his portrait by Orpen \\"makes me look proud, pompous and prelatical\\", to which Henson responded, \\"And to which of those epithets does your Grace take exception?\\"Chadwick, p. 244 Grimley remarks that on occasion each of those unflattering adjectives applied just as much to Henson. Nonetheless, Henson ranked Lang \\"among the greater figures of ecclesiastical history\\".Lockhart, p. 295 The most conspicuous cause with which Henson was involved during his time at Durham was, in Anglican terms, of national, and even international, rather than diocesan concern. As a broad churchman he gave strong support in the mid-1920s to a major revision and modernising of the Book of Common Prayer, the Church's prescribed forms of worship, used at all services. The evangelical wing of the Church opposed the revision, which some low-church factions dubbed \\"popish\\".\\"Prayer-Book Revision\\", The Times 1 May 1928, p. 18 Henson, now on the same side as the Anglo-Catholics with whom he had early been in bitter dispute, called the opposition \\"the Protestant underworld\\".\\"Prayer-Book Revision\\", The Times, 30 March 1927, p. 11 Despite the clear majority of clergy and laity in favour of the revision, the House of Commons refused to authorise it, and voted it down in 1927 and again in 1928. Henson's colleague Cyril Garbett wrote that the Commons had \\"made it plain that the Church does not possess full spiritual freedom to determine its worship\\".Garbett, p. 194 The Church instituted damage limitation measures by permitting parishes to use the new unauthorised text where there was a local consensus to do so, but Henson was horrified at what he saw as Parliament's betrayal of its duty to preside impartially over the governance of the Church, giving in to pressure from what he termed \\"an army of illiterates\\".Chadwick, p. 193 1922 sketch of Henson, with Durham Cathedral in the background Together with the suspicions he had started to harbour that a socialist government might misuse ecclesiastical patronage, the Prayer Book debacle turned Henson from a strong proponent of establishment to its best- known critic. He spent much time and energy fruitlessly campaigning for disestablishment. He was, as he had often been earlier in his career, an isolated figure. Few of his colleagues agreed with him, even those dismayed by the parliamentary vote. He was less isolated in some other causes he took up in the 1920s and 30s. He was one of many wary of the ultra-liberalism of the Modern Churchmen's Union. In 1934, he was among the senior clerics who censured Dean Dwelly for inviting a Unitarian to preach in Liverpool Cathedral and Bishop David for permitting it.Kennerley, p. 138 He was critical of American evangelism as practised by Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group. Henson wrote of Buchman's \\"oracular despotism\\" and \\"the trail of moral and intellectual wrecks which its progress leaves behind.\\"Henson, Hensley. \\"The Oxford Group\\", The Times, 19 September 1933, p. 8 Henson was in a minority of senior clergy in speaking out against the dictators of the Axis powers. He condemned Nazi anti-Semitism, Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, appeasement and the Munich agreement. On 1 February 1939, at the age of seventy-five, he retired from Durham to Hintlesham in Suffolk.\\"Ecclesiastical News\\", The Times, 13 January 1939, p. 15 Seven months later the Second World War began. Henson supported the Allies' fight in what he saw as a just war to defeat godless barbarism; he wrote of \\"The deepening infamies of Nazi warfare ‚Äì infamies so horrible as almost to shake one's faith in the essential Divineness of Humanity.\\"Henson (1951), p. 164 He urged, \\"there can be no compromise or patched up peace\\".Henson (1951), p. 123 =Last years= Winston Churchill was impressed by Henson. Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed at the time and later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the momentary strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941. In his later years Henson's lifelong sense of loneliness was compounded by the growing deafness of his wife, making their conversation difficult.Peart-Binns, p. 188 He found some solace in the friendship of her companion, Fearne Booker, who lived with the Hensons for more than thirty years. He occupied a considerable part of his retirement writing a substantial work of autobiography, published in three volumes under the title Retrospect of an Unimportant Life. Both at the time and subsequently many of his friends and admirers regretted his publishing the work; they thought he had done his reputation a disservice. Despite what Williams calls the \\"peculiar interest and vivacity\\" of the books, his survey of his many campaigns and controversies, seemed to others to be self-justifying and wilfully to deny many changes of stance that he had manifestly made during his career. In Williams's view the posthumous publication of Henson's edited letters were a better legacy: \\"delightful in both form and content, and, barbed though they often are, they do him fuller justice\\". He was offered the masonic position of Provincial Grand Master in his retirement, but declined it, believing himself too old. In his writings Henson referred to his two regrets in life. The first was that he had not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was that he and his wife had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson. Henson died at Hintlesham on 27 September 1947 at the age of eighty-four. At his wish his body was cremated; his ashes were interred in Durham Cathedral.

Like other LETSs, ECOSIMIA is a non-monetary mutual credit system that includes a record of the transactions made by each member. When two group members exchange a product or service, they assign that transaction a numerical value. They inform the local bank, who enter it into their public records. The numerical value has purely statistic meaning: there are no debts and it is not possible to demand an equivalent to this number. Transactions on a regional level are agreed directly between the groups. Beginning in 2000 the economic situation for most of the people in Ecuador became more difficult with the introduction of the US Dollar as national currency. During this crisis, Mauricio Wild (the co-founder of the Fundaci√≥n Educativa Pestalozzi) resolved to create a decentralized network of groups to trade all over the country. These groups spread particularly in the rural areas of Ecuador. Today there are already about 140 Ecosimia-groups in Ecuador, operating in 13 provinces. In this particular case a number of such groups from all over Ecuador have come together to form a country-wide trading network.

Geography Gause is located at (30.7851923, -96.7213641 ). It is situated along U.S. Highway 79/190, sixteen miles southeast of Cameron and twenty-nine miles west of Bryan/College Station. History The community is named for William J. Gause, a settler who moved to the area in 1872 and built a home out of lumber hauled from Montgomery. In 1873, he gave right-of-way and of land to the International-Great Northern Railroad (I&GN;). This caused the area to grow and a post office opened in 1874. A schoolhouse that doubled as a church was built in 1876. Gause had approximately 300 residents in 1884 as well as two steam-powered cotton gins and two churches. Gause was a shipping point for Milam County farmers who shipped corn, cotton, and cottonseed oil. The Gause Independent School District was established in 1905. The population reached its peak around 1915, when 1,000 people lived in the community. Gause slowly declined over the next few decades. Its bank was discontinued in 1927 after 17 years in operation. The combination of a decline in the number of businesses in Gause and the introduction of the automobile precipitated further downturns in the local economy. By the 1960s, the community had 278 residents, down from 750 in the 1940s. The population began to rebound in the late 1980s as more people chose to live in Gause and commute to jobs in nearby industrial plants. In 1990, Gause had 400 residents and eight businesses. The population remained unchanged as of 2000. Despite its unincorporated status, Gause continues to have a functioning post office (zip code:77857).Zip Code Lookup Education Public education in the community of Gause is provided by the Gause Independent School District. The district operates a single campus that serves an estimated 150 students in grades pre-kindergarten through eight.

The pieces are grouped into fourteen unpublished albums under this self-deprecating and ironic title. The ordering of the pieces in the albums does not reflect the sequence or the dates of their composition, which range from 1857 to shortly before Rossini's death in 1868. The title P√©ch√©s de vieillesse was given by Rossini only to volumes V to IX but has been applied to all. The collection is salon music, though of a refined order, meant to be performed in the privacy of Rossini's drawing room at Passy. Volumes I, II, III and XI are vocal music to piano accompaniment. Volumes IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X and XII are music for solo piano. Volume IX is for chamber ensemble or solo piano. Volumes XIII and XIV comprise vocal and non-vocal music. *Vol I Album italiano *Vol II Album fran√ßais *Vol III Morceaux r√©serv√©s *Vol IV Quatre hors d‚Äô≈ìuvres et quatre mendiants *Vol V Album pour les enfants adolescents *Vol VI Album pour les enfants d√©gourdis *Vol VII Album de chaumi√®re *Vol VIII Album de ch√¢teau *Vol IX Album pour piano, violon, violoncello, harmonium et cor *Vol X Miscellan√©e pour piano *Vol XI Miscellan√©e de musique vocale *Vol XII Quelques riens pour album *Vol XIII Musique anodine (1857).

The Soci√©t√© anonyme de publications p√©riodique, Paris, was among the buyers, who sold publishing rights to the firm of Heugel. The edition was prepared by Auguste Vaucorbeil (1821‚Äì1884), director of the Paris Op√©ra, who reordered the pieces and gave them new picturesque titles, as Rossini's often nonsensical titles, which looked forward to Erik Satie's, were deemed unsuitable. Critical editions of all the albums are in process of publication by the , Pesaro, which conserves the original autograph manuscripts; they are distributed by Ricordi of Milan. The new editions restore Rossini's expressively precise musical notation and offer heretofore unpublished alternative versions of some P√©ch√©s. Arrangements In 1918, Ottorino Respighi orchestrated a number of the piano pieces for the ballet La Boutique fantasque. In 1925, he arranged some more piano pieces, from Vol. XII (Quelques riens), as the orchestral suite Rossiniana. Benjamin Britten also used some of Rossini's themes in his orchestrally arranged suites \\"Soir√©es musicales\\", Op. 9, (1936) and \\"Matin√©es musicales\\", Op. 24 (1941).

The rule broadly provides that where the equitable owner of an asset purports to dispose of his equitable interest on two or more occasions, and the equities are equal between claimants, the claimant who first notifies the trustee or legal owner of the asset shall have a first priority claim. Although the original decisions related to interests under a trust, most modern applications of the rule relate to the factoring of receivablesA common scenario is where a company grants a floating charge over all its assets, including its book debts, to a bank, and then the company also purports to factor the book debts to an independent factor. As between the bank and the factor, the person who will have a priority claim to the receivables will generally be the person who first notifies the legal title holder (ie. the debtor) of their claim. or multiple grants of equitable security interests. The rule has been subject to some scathing criticism,See for example, Legal Aspects Receivable Financing (2000), Fidelis Oditah; and Commercial Law (2nd ed), Roy Goode, in which the author indicates: \\"It is high time that the rule in Dearle v Hall was abolished\\" at page 705. and has been abrogated in a number of common law countries in the Commonwealth. History The rule in Dearle v Hall has been controversial almost since its inception. In 1893, Lord Macnaghten said \\"I am inclined to think that the rule in Dearle v Hall has on the whole produced at least as much injustice as it has prevented.\\"Ward v Duncombe [1893] AC 369 But this has not stopped it from being extended from a rule regulating the priority of interests in trusts to the regulation of the priority of proprietary interests in debts and other similar intangibles, such as rights under contracts, which is considerably more important in terms of modern commerce. The actual decision in Dearle v Hall, on its facts, is relatively uncontroversial. The beneficial owner of a trust fund assigned it first by way of security to A, and then outright to B, in each case for valuable consideration. A had not given notice of his assignment to the trustees of the fund and, accordingly, when B made enquiries of them, he did not discover the existence of the assignment to A because the trustees were not aware of it. B did give notice of the assignment to the trustees, and then A subsequently also gave notice to them. Plumer MR and, on appeal, Lord Lyndhurst LC each decided that B took priority over A. Judgment was given in favour of B for two reasons. The first was based on the general proposition, that, as between two equitable interests, the first in time will only take priority \\"if the equities are equal\\". In this case, by failing to give notice to the trustees, A had allowed the beneficiary of the trust to be able to hold himself out as being the unencumbered owner of the beneficial interest and had therefore enabled the beneficiary to hoodwink B into thinking he had not encumbered it. This is a perfectly straightforward application of the principle that the first in time will only prevail if the equities are equal and is not considered controversial. The second ground for the decision was that A's failure to give notice had left the beneficiary of the trust in apparent possession of the trust fund, and A could not, therefore, rely on this assignment in a dispute with B. This latter ground has been criticised as it appears to be based on the concept of reputed ownership in bankruptcy law, which had never previously been employed in determining priority between competing equitable claims. Nevertheless, on the facts of the case most commentators feel that justice was done; A had allowed the beneficiary to commit a fraud on B, and therefore A should rank behind B. Development However, it was in subsequent developments that the rule was turned from an example of the principle that the first in time rule will not apply if the equities are not equal into an absolute rule that the first to give notice will take priority unless the later assignee was a volunteerRe General Horticultural Company (1886) 32 Ch D 512 or was aware of the earlier assignment at the time he obtained his assignment.Re Holmes (1885) 29 Ch D 786 The rule applies even if the later assignee made no enquiries of the trusteesFoster v Cockerell (1835) 3 Cl & Fin 456 and even if the first assignee was not negligent in failing to give notice, for instance because he was not aware of itRe Lake [1903] 1 KB 151 or because there was no one to whom notice could be given.Re Dallas [1904] 2 Ch 385 In Ward v Duncombe [1893] AC 369, the House of Lords decided that the rule that notice determines priority of dealings applied regardless of the conduct of the competing assignees. Criticisms In spite of the criticisms of the way in which the rule in Dearle v Hall has developed, there is much to be said for the concept that the priority of assignments or charges over debts should, as a general rule, depend on the date notice is given to the person who owes the debt. Not least, this is because the person who owes the debt will get a good discharge by paying the creditor unless he has been notified of the assignment or charge. Once a debt has been paid, it ceases to exist, and the priority rule recognises this fact. That is not to say that, in appropriate cases, it would not be possible for one creditor to trace the proceeds of the debt into the hands of another. But a simple rule that both priority and discharge depend on notice has much to recommend it. Most of the academic criticism of the rule is to the effect that it has been carried too far. Whilst it is generally accepted for a subsequent assignee for value to take priority over an earlier assignee by giving notice before he becomes aware of the earlier assignment, it seems harsh for the earlier assignee to lose priority where the notice is given by the subsequent assignee after he is aware of the earlier assignment. The net result is the priority depends upon the subsequent speed of response of the parties once one or both of them becomes aware of the problem. Reform The Law Commission of England and Wales, as part of a wider view of priority rules relating to security interests has recommended the abolition of the rule in Dearle v Hall in relation to security interests and assignments of receivables only, and its replacement with a system of registration.The Law Commission Consultation Paper No.164 To date, such recommendations have not been implemented.

With the advent of cheap long- playing records, unscrupulous companies issued records of material under pseudonyms to avoid paying royalties or because they did not own the copyright to the recordings. In the case of Paul Procopolis, the reasons for the recording company, Saga Records issuing recordings pseudonymously are uncertain, as they would have had the copyright to at least some of the material. According to Robin O'Connor (see Sources), the company's intention was to compile pre-existing recordings by several different performers on one album and present them as the work of a single performer. The name Paul Procopolis was used to reissue recordings by the pianist Sergio Fiorentino, including the complete Chopin waltzes, extracts from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, and works by Liszt. Some of the LPs included a biography of Procopolis who, it was alleged, was born in Athens in 1934, studied with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and lived and taught in Greece. The biography was written by Robin O'Connor. Various other LPs give no biographical information at all. Ernst Lumpe has attempted to identify the real artists in the Procopolis recordings. Other pianists whose recordings were issued under this name included Bernard Vitebsky (his Beethoven Concerto No. 3), Albert Ferber (an LP of \\"The World's Best Loved Piano Music\\") and Clive Lythgoe. The recording of the Second Chopin Concerto has been identified as that of the Brazilian pianist Carmen Vitis Adnet (who lived in Vienna and was married to pianist Hans Graf) with the Vienna Symphony under Hans Swarowsky. Further recordings (such as the First Chopin Concerto) remain unidentified. Sources * The Fiorentino recordings issued under the name of Procopolis are identified at Ernst Lumpe's website. * Robin O'Connor, the man who assembled many of the Paul Procopolis LPs, recounts how they came into being on the MusicWeb website.

Biography She earned an A.B. degree from Bates College in 1925. She then moved to New York City to study singing and acting. She was hired as an actress with the Group Theater, which was directed by Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman, and with the Provincetown Players, an avant-garde theater. Her Broadway credits include Come of Age, with Judith Anderson, and L'Aiglon, with Ethel Barrymore. She married William C. Esty, founder of the William Esty Advertising Agency in the 1930s. Esty continued her interest in the arts, and she began to commission works by many noted composers, poets, and visual artists. In the late 1950s and early 1960s she spent considerable time in Paris, where she befriended many important composers and artists. Between 1955 and 1969 she regularly commissioned musical compositions, and then performed them in major recital halls, including The Town Hall and Carnegie Recital Hall. If Mrs. Esty's talent as a singer was not perhaps perfect (Ned Rorem referred to her as \\"a soprano of style and means if not especially of temperament...\\"Ned Rorem \\"Yesterday is Not Today: the American Art Song 1930-1960 a personal survey\\" in New World Records no. 80243), her importance as an arts patron is certainly notable. Esty lived in Paris frequently in the 1950s and the 1960s and between 1955-1969 she commissioned musical compositions from many French composers including Germaine Tailleferre, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, Henri Sauguet and others which she performed in her Town Hall and Carnegie Recital Hall concerts. In addition, she also commissioned Poulenc's Sonata for Two Pianos for the American piano duo Gold and Fizdale. In 1963, she commissioned works by French and American composers for a special memorial concert for the recently deceased Francis Poulenc, which she performed in Carnegie Recital Hall. In 1994 and 1995, Mrs. Esty donated the manuscripts for many of her commissioned works to the Library of Bates College where they are located today. Esty died of cancer in New York.

The Virgin Money brand was founded by Richard Branson in March 1995. It was originally known as Virgin Direct, and pioneered index tracking by launching a value personal equity plan into the market. In the 2000s Virgin Money expanded its operations around the world. Virgin Money announced plans to become a retail bank, and attempted to purchase Northern Rock in 2007 before it was nationalised by the British Government. Virgin applied for its own banking licence from the Financial Services Authority in 2009, and gained one through the acquisition of Church House Trust the following year. Virgin bought Northern Rock in January 2012 and rebranded the business as Virgin Money. In June 2018, Virgin Money agreed to a takeover by CYBG plc which was completed in October 2018. Virgin Money was merged into Clydesdale Bank plc on 21 October 2019, continuing as a trading name and operating under Clydesdale Bank plc's banking licence. It is planned that between December 2019 and late 2021, Virgin Money UK plc will phase out the Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and B brands in favour of the Virgin Money brand. History =Formation= Virgin Money UK was launched as Virgin Direct Personal Financial Services in partnership with Norwich Union on 3 March 1995 offering personal equity plans and launched Virgin One, in a partnership with the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), in 1997. That year, Australia's AMP bought Norwich Union's 50% stake in Virgin Direct. In 2000, virginmoney.com was launched as a price comparison website. RBS bought out Virgin's stake in the One Account joint venture in 2001. In 2002, Virgin Direct merged with virginmoney.com to form the current company. Virgin Money expanded its operations around the world in the 2000s. The Virgin Group took 100% ownership of Virgin Money in April 2004, buying the remaining 50% stake for ¬£90 million from AMP. In 2007, Virgin made a bid to acquire the Northern Rock bank; this initial bid failed. In an interview with The Times on 9 March 2009, Branson stated that he still hoped that Virgin Money would expand its operations into the banking sector, saying \\"We are going to get back into the mortgage business and we will become a bank either by acquisition or by getting our own banking licence. You will see us become a consumer bank within the next couple of years.\\" In October 2009, Virgin Money applied to the Financial Services Authority for a full banking licence. In February 2011 they announced their intention to lease a large office in Edinburgh. On 8 January 2010, Virgin Money announced the acquisition of Church House Trust for ¬£12.3 million, giving Virgin a small foothold in the UK banking market. Although Church House Trust had no branches, it provided Virgin with a banking licence. As part of the acquisition, Virgin agreed to invest a further ¬£37.3 million of new capital into the business. On 26 January the deal was declared unconditional. In late January Sir Brian Pitman became the Chairman of Virgin Money; Pitman had previously been an advisor to Virgin during the attempted buyout of Northern Rock in 2007. In February Pitman stated that the company was interested in acquiring some branches of other banks which lie in good locations; branches belonging to the RBS and Lloyds were reported as possible candidates. Following Pitman's death Sir David Clementi was appointed Chairman. In April 2010, Wilbur Ross invested ¬£100 million in Virgin Money for a 21% stake in the company. Wilbur Ross had previously supported Virgin Money in its previous bid for Northern Rock. James Lockhart, Vice Chairman of WL Ross & Co, joined the Virgin Money board. = Acquisition of Northern Rock plc = A branch of the Northern Rock with Virgin Money branding on Briggate in Leeds On 13 October 2007, Sir Richard Branson announced that Virgin Group were putting together a consortium of financiers to propose to plough millions into the troubled Northern Rock bank and in return take an approximate 30% stake in the business, bringing the current financial products offered by Virgin and combining them with Northern Rock's own financial products. By February 2008, Virgin were the favoured bidders for the bank and announced in its official submission to the government that, if successful, they would have merged Northern Rock and Virgin Money, naming the new company \\"Virgin Bank\\". The initial bid was not successful, and Northern Rock was then nationalised. During 2011 the government again asked suitors to come forward with proposals for Northern Rock. On 17 November 2011, it was announced that Virgin Money were to buy Northern Rock for ¬£747 million, with other potential payments of up to ¬£280 million over the next few years. By July 2012, a further ¬£73 million was paid as deferred consideration. WL Ross & Co increased its stake in Virgin Money, owning 44% of the combined business by putting ¬£260 million into the deal. Both Abu Dhabi-based Stanhope Investments and Branson's Virgin Group invested ¬£50 million in the Northern Rock deal. In 2014, Virgin Money repaid a further ¬£154.5 million that it had received as part of the refinancing package. There were to be no further job losses, except for those previously announced. Virgin has also pledged to keep the headquarters of the savings and mortgages business in Newcastle upon Tyne. On 9 January 2012, Richard Branson visited the Gosforth site and some branches of Northern Rock around Newcastle, including one with temporary Virgin Money branding. =Later developments= On 22 June 2012, Virgin acquired the remainder of the Gosforth site from Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc, the \\"bad-bank\\" which had been split from Northern Rock prior to the sale of the bank to Virgin. On 23 July it was announced that Virgin would also be acquiring ¬£465 million worth of mortgage assets from Northern Rock (Asset Management). On 12 October, Northern Rock plc was renamed Virgin Money plc and the Northern Rock brand was phased out. In January 2013, Virgin agreed to buy ¬£1 billion of assets from MBNA; these are the Virgin Credit Card assets which MBNA has serviced and managed in partnership with Virgin Money since 2002. The credit card book was integrated into Virgin Money's operations in 2014, and was expected to create 150 jobs at the Gosforth offices. The former Vice Chairman of MBNA Corporation, Lance Weaver, became Virgin Money's President of Virgin Money Cards. A further ¬£363 million credit card asset portfolio was purchased from MBNA in 2014. In October 2014, it was announced that Virgin Money Holdings (UK) plc would float shares on the London Stock Exchange in order to raise approximately ¬£150 million which would go towards expanding and enabling it to continue to hire and maintain its existing base of top staff members. A successful offer led to a final payment of ¬£50 million to the UK Government with respect to the company's IPO following the purchase of Northern Rock. Church House Trust Limited was sold to Ocean Industries S.A. for ¬£13 million on 30 November 2014. WL Ross & Co reduced its stake in the company to 23.3% in April 2015; Stanhope reduced its stake to 1%. WL Ross & Co sold its remaining stake in November 2016. As of 2017, the business had 3.34 million customers. =Acquisition by CYBG plc= On 7 May 2018, it was reported that CYBG plc had made an all-share offer of ¬£1.7bn to acquire the company. Payment was to be in terms of a share offer where CYBG would give 1.2125 new shares for each Virgin Money share which was a 19% premium to the current share price and would see Virgin Money comprising 38% of the new combined group which would become the UK's sixth-largest bank with 6 million personal and small business customers, and total lending of ¬£70bn. On 18 June, it was announced that the takeover had been agreed. Arrangements were made for CYBG to license the Virgin Money brand for ¬£12 million a year (later rising to ¬£15 million a year) and to move all its retail customers to Virgin Money over the following three years. The acquisition of Virgin Money plc by CYBG was completed on 15 October 2018 and shares in the holding company Virgin Money Holdings (UK) plc were therefore delisted from the London Stock Exchange. It was reported that the deal may result in 1,500 job losses. The retail banking operation would be fronted by the Virgin Money brand and the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank brands would disappear from the High street. Virgin Money CEO chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia will be retained as a senior advisor and will receive around ¬£1.8m redundancy, ¬£1m bonus, ¬£5.1m in shares to add to her existing ¬£8.9m shares. The all-share deal buyout gave her a paper profit of around ¬£12.5m. Sir Richard Branson, who owned a 35% stake in Virgin Money, will have a 13% holding in the new combined group. In June 2019, CYBG plc announced its plans to consolidate its businesses under the Virgin Money brand. B and Yorkshire Bank, which exist as trading divisions of Clydesdale Bank plc, will begin to use the Virgin Money name in late 2019 and Clydesdale Bank will use the new name from late 2020 to early 2021. In preparation for re-branding, the existing Virgin Money plc was merged into the existing Clydesdale Bank plc on 21 October 2019. Corporate affairs = Identity = A Virgin Money store on Briggate in Leeds Interior of Virgin Money's Manchester lounge Virgin Money's logo is focused around the main logo of Virgin Group, which is an underlined word 'Virgin' in a red circle. The most recent version of the logo was adopted in December 2019 and has the word \\"Virgin\\" in a red circle forming the letter O in the word \\"Money\\". The previous logo was adopted in January 2012 and was introduced to signify the purchase of Northern Rock, which used a magenta logo. Virgin Money's January 2012 television advert showcasing the launch of banking products showcased a number of Virgin companies and was directed by Duncan Jones and worked on by Beattie McGuinness Bungay. Virgin Money's older logo was the word 'Virgin' in a red rounded skew rectangle, similar in shape to a credit card, followed by the word 'Money'. A previous logo had the word 'Virgin' in a large circle and three smaller circles above the word 'Money'. Virgin Direct's logo had been a more simplistic rendering of the company name, in white on top of a red rectangle with a semicircle attached on the left side. = Offices = Virgin Money's headquarters are Jubilee House in Newcastle upon Tyne. Virgin took on Northern Rock's offices in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne, renaming it Jubilee House. The site is next to the Regent Centre business park and comprises two black and grey buildings built in the 1990s and some additional sandstone and glass buildings built in the early 2000s. Virgin Money also have offices in Eagle Place, Piccadilly, London, at 28 St Andrew Square, Edinburgh, Gorstacks House in Chester and Discovery House in Norwich, which had been Virgin Money's head office prior to becoming a bank.  Services  The Virgin Money Northumberland Street store, Newcastle upon Tyne. This store was formerly a Northern Rock branch and the branded clock, which retains its Northern Rock lettering, became a well-known symbol of the former bank's collapse. Virgin Money offers a range of savings and investment products, mortgages, credit cards, insurance and pensions. The merger with Northern Rock widened Virgin Money's range from a previous focus on credit cards and insurance products, and the first savings accounts to be offered under the Virgin brand were issued in January 2012. These were gradually supplemented by other additional banking products under its own brand name. The bank launched its own range of basic current accounts in July 2014, initially only in Scotland and Northern Ireland. This was expanded to the rest of the UK in 2015. In November 2011, the bank opened the first of its concept lounges in Norwich, followed by Edinburgh, Manchester, London and Glasgow with plans to open more. Virgin renamed Northern Rock's 75 branches as stores, and the first to receive a temporary Virgin makeover opened on 9 January 2012. Richard Branson has also indicated in interviews that he would like to open branches at railway stations; Virgin Rail Group operated a number of railway stations at the time. The full rebranding process, which also included the combining of the Northern Rock website into the existing Virgin Money website, was completed by October. Virgin Money launched a fully functional current in December 2019. The account uses technology previously used by the \\"B\\" account offered by Clydesdale Bank. All existing \\"B\\" accounts were converted to Virgin Money current accounts as part of this process.https://www.youandb.co.uk/current-account-and-savings/ The bank is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.  Virgin Money Giving  Virgin Money Giving is a not-for-profit company set up by Virgin in October 2009. From 2010, the Virgin Group signed a five-year deal to be the official sponsor of the London Marathon; the inaugural Virgin London Marathon was on 25 April 2010. This sponsorship led to the creation of Virgin Money Giving, with the aim \\"to help all fund-raisers raise more money for good causes\\". This sponsorship was also extended to at least 2017, and since the 2014 race has been known as the Virgin Money London Marathon.  Virgin Money Foundation  The Virgin Money Foundation is the charitable arm of the bank and was founded in 2015. The bank has initially pledged ¬£4 million to the charity over 4 years, and the UK Government has committed to match that pledge.  Sponsorship  Virgin Money leads the sponsorship of the London Marathon. Virgin Money also lent its name to the yacht that Sir Richard Branson used to attempt to break the Transatlantic sailing record. Since 2011 Virgin Money has sponsored events at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Virgin Money were the shirt sponsor of Newcastle United F.C. for the 2012-13 season, a club that had a sponsorship deal with Northern Rock since 2003. Newcastle United's shirts also displayed the Virgin Money logo for the remainder of the 2011‚Äì12 season, fulfilling Northern Rock's deal at the time of being bought by Virgin. To coincide with the launch of Virgin Money's rebranded stores, Richard Branson appeared in Newcastle, wearing a Newcastle United shirt, with a number of Newcastle United's footballers. The deal between Virgin Money and Newcastle United had also covered the 2013-14 season, but the club decided to end the deal a year early. Virgin Money are the title sponsor of the Cyclone, the UK's biggest cycling festival, which had previously also been sponsored by Northern Rock. The first Virgin Money Cyclone was held in Summer 2012.  International operations  In 2003, Virgin Money launched its first venture outside of the UK by introducing its credit cards in Australia. In 2006, Virgin Money South Africa launched with a credit card initially in a partnership with ABSA. In 2007, Virgin Money launched in the United States after the Virgin Group made a majority stake investment in CircleLending, a company that facilitated peer-to-peer loans.

The camp traces its roots to Ramah Connecticut in 1953,\\"Mrs. Malensky Camp Ramah Board Choice\\", Bridgeport Sunday Herald, March 24, 1957 followed by Ramah at Glen Spey, and has evolved into Camp Ramah in New England. The camp provides campers with a Jewish educational experience. Campers are known as \\"Ramahniks.\\" Ramah New England is known for its programs in sports, arts, Judaica, and Hebrew. Billy Mencow was director of the camp from 2000‚Äì2005. Rabbi Ed Gelb has been the director of the camp from 2006‚Äìpresent. Divisions (edot) The camp is broken into different age groups, or edot (◊¢◊ì◊ï◊™) (s. edah): Kochavim (stars) : 3‚Äì4th graders (2 weeks) Ilanot (young trees): 4‚Äì5th graders (4/8 weeks) Solelim (roadpavers): 6th graders (4/8 weeks) Shoafim (strivers): 7th graders (4/8 weeks) Magshimim (achievers): 8th graders (4/8 weeks) Bogrim (mature ones): 9th graders (4/8 weeks) Machon (institution): 10th graders (4/8 weeks) Nivonim (wise ones): 11th graders (8 weeks) Amitzim: (brave ones) campers with special needs, as old as 21 (4/8 weeks) Tochnit Ha'avodah (vocational education or \\"voc-ed\\"): former Amitzim'ers who are employed by camp After Nivonim year, rising 12th graders attend the Ramah Seminar, a trip to Israel, and spend six weeks traveling around the country with other Ramahniks of the same age. They also have the option to attend an option week long trip to Poland. The camp has a program for developmentally disabled youth, entitled the Tikvah Vocational program. Camp life The camp is divided into two sides: A-Side and B-Side. A-side hosts Kochavim through Shoafim and B-Side hosts the rest of the edot along with the dining hall, infirmary (marp), ropes course, tree house, and Beit Midrash complex, and beit am gadol. The oldest edah, Nivonim, is housed in a building complex called the K'far. =Palmer= Palmer, as the camp is also nicknamed, has a number of traditions, including Color War (Yom Sport), an annual sports competition within the camp, yamim meyuchadim, \\"special days\\", an ongoing sports rivalry with Camp Ramah in the Berkshires, Zimkudiyah, a song and dance festival, plays performed by the four older edot entirely in Hebrew (in 2007 Toy Story, Grease, High School Musical, and The Prince of Egypt were all performed), and singing the Camp Ramah song, Shir Ramah. They play the rival camp in the Berkshires under the unofficial mascot, the \\"Palmer Fighting Roos.\\" The \\"Roo\\" has its own songs as well as merchandise. Each edah participates in a camping trip known as \\"etgar\\" (the Hebrew word for challenge); younger children camp out within the grounds of the camp while older edot are given the opportunity to travel off the grounds and choose from a number of hiking, canoeing, biking, rock climbing and rappelling, and spelunking trips. A delegation is sent each year to ArtsFest, an annual gathering of regional Jewish camps featuring a variety of songs and dances. Their reputation has been noted and recognized by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.https://www.facebook.com/david.offit?ref=br_rs\\"Summer camps now specialize\\", The Republican, March 27, 2008 =Shabbat= Shabbat is given a great deal of attention, with all of the camp gathering together for Friday night services and dinner. Saturday morning services are held within each edah, with senior staff members often giving Divrei Torah to the campers. On Friday nights, Nivonimers lead shira and on Saturday night, they lead Seudat Shlishit. Also, on Friday nights Nivonimers have the chance to give \\"Oh My Lord's\\" which are short speeches about life lessons usually learned in camp. Many of the sports teams that will participate in Yom Berkshires will practice with Saturday afternoon games, and Mincha is held for all of B-side. Havdalah is held by edah, and B-side has Israeli dancing sessions, called Mandatory Fun Time (MFT) immediately following Havdalah each Saturday night. =Yamim Ragilim= Yamim ragilim (\\"regular days\\") are broken into time periods called perakim (s. perek) and each is identified with a Hebrew letter (◊ê, ◊ë, ◊í, ◊ì, ◊î, ◊ï, ◊ñ). A regular day includes a sport, swimming, a chug (a special interest), Hebrew classes, Yahadut (Jewish history and culture) classes, free time, a period of rest, and shira or rikud (\\"song\\" or \\"dance\\"). Examples of chugim include omanut (art), nagarut (woodworking), dance, swimming, boating, a variety of sports, and video. In 2007, a number of new adjustments were made to the schedule, including an extra period known as bechirot (free choices), during which campers may choose from a number of activities in which to participate; shortened perakim for Hebrew and Yahadut, and a rotating two-meal schedule. Camp Ramah Yahadut is renowned for its ability to integrate formal learning with experiential education. The staff, headed by Heather Fiedler, includes leading educational professionals from local synagogues and prep- school institutions such as Gann Academy in Waltham, Massachusetts. Campers describe their educational experiences at Ramah as \\"meaningful\\" and \\"not like Hebrew school under the trees at all.\\" =Wednesdays= On Wednesdays, non- counselor staff members take their day off, so the counselors in each edah plan a special day free of regular programming called yamim meyuchadim (special days) to make up for the lack of staffing. In addition, once a session each edah takes a trip outside of the camp. Each special day is called \\"Yom (Name)\\". Yamim meyuchadim can be anything from Yom Pirate to Yom Willy Wonka, Yom Random, Yom MTV, etc., all with special programs and activities planned by the staff members. Special trips have taken campers to Red Sox games, art museums, the zoo, ice skating rinks, the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, and other locations around New England. General CRNE hosts children from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, New England, eastern New York (most notably Albany and the Hudson Valley) and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area (predominantly Maryland and Northern Virginia. There are also a number of Israeli campers. The staff are usually former campers and hail from the same territory, but there are many Israelis, collectively called mishlachat. The mishlachat are counselors, live-ins, Hebrew teachers, and Yahadut teachers. They also organize programs to educate campers about Israel. CRNE has the largest Israeli delegation of all the Ramah camps, and also hosts a number of Israeli campers. There are approximately 900 campers and 250 staff at the camp over the course of eight weeks. Notable alumni * Ben Bernanke\\"9 Famous Jews Who Went to Jewish Summer Camp\\".

(The name \\"Jazz Butcher\\" has been applied ambiguously both to Fish and the whole band.) Early career Fish was born in London but moved early in his life to Northampton; there he attended Great Houghton Preparatory School and later Uppingham; he later read Lit. Hum. at Merton College, Oxford, graduating in 1980.Oxford University Calendar, 1980‚Äì81. From the evidence of an interview given in 1989, it would seem that he found academic life at Oxford uninspiring, and that he was soon drawn to making music.Green, Dominic, and Nick Johnson, 'The Jazz Butcher', Isis no.3 (Oxford), (Trinity Term 1989), p.33. His bands in the early period included one known as Nightshift, and the Institution, which featured Max Eider (Peter Millson) on guitar, Rolo McGinty (later of The Woodentops), and Jonathan Stephenson.J. G. Stephenson, email of 18 April 2002, archived at Jazz Butcher website The Sonic Tonix became The Tonix, who released a single, \\"Strangers / Talk to Me\\" on the Cherry Red label (STEG 002) in 1981. The persona of the \\"Jazz Butcher\\" was devised soon after, and Fish's first gig under this guise was in Oxford on 20 February 1982. The band included Alice Thompson, later keyboardist in The Woodentops, and later still a novelist, and Owen Jones, who was to become the Jazz Butcher's drummer for much of the 1980s. Max Eider, a crucial element in the early Butcher sound, joined for a gig in June of that year. For a full account of the history of The Jazz Butcher band, the reader is referred to the entry under that name. The next significant phase of Fish's career began on 27 November 1986 when musical and personal tensions between him and Eider, exacerbated by long touring and drinking, led to Eider's departure in Z√ºrich. Fish rebuilt the Jazz Butcher band, recruiting Kizzy O'Callaghan as guitarist; saxophonist Alex Green was the only other element of continuity with the earlier band. Around this time his contract with Glass Records ended, and he signed to Alan McGee's Creation Records, at that time one of the foremost indie labels in Britain. In 1989, Fish hosted an indie music show called Transmission, which was produced by Music Box Ltd. for ITV and pan-European British station Super Channel.  The 1990s and beyond  The Jazz Butcher continued to gig regularly in the early 1990s and to record for Creation until 1995, but by the late 1980s Fish was feeling restricted both by the \\"Jazz Butcher\\" name (McGee had persuaded him to keep it on joining Creation), and by guitar pop. Creation's success with My Bloody Valentine's Glider EP created an opportunity to develop his interest in dance music. His first foray was the Jazz Butcher Conspiracy's cover version of The Rolling Stones' \\"We Love You\\", was released under the name \\"JBC\\" in 1990 (CRE083T), and later included in the Creation dance compilation \\"Keeping the Faith\\" (CRECD 081) (1991). Soon afterwards the somewhat mysterious \\"Black Eg\\" project began: an album of ambient dance music built around synthesizers and samples, purporting to be the work of one Karel von Dammerung of Vienna, was released by Creation in 1991. The Black themselves made their live debut on 1 June 1994 at Soundshaft in London. In the early 1990s Fish diversified his activities in other ways. He produced at least one record, the single \\"Lost at Sea\\" by 13 Frightened Girls (recorded in 1990 and released in 1991). He appeared on recordings by other bands, contributing a flute solo to \\"I Love You\\" on the Spacemen 3's Recurring (1991), and guitar and organ on The Blue Aeroplanes' Rough Music (1995). By 1996, Fish had formed a new band with other Northampton-based musicians, eventually settling on the name Sumosonic. One of the other names he had considered, \\"Audio-Aquatic\\", surfaces in the lyrics to their debut single, \\"Come, Friendly Spacemen\\", released by Creation on 5 December 1996 (CRESCD 242). The band had their live debut in London 11 March 1997. Though the band included Fish as a guitarist, their sound was built far more around sequencers, and the rhythms were more dance-orientated.

Williams on 5 October 1863; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard 19 April 1864, Commander John C. Howell in command. Service history The schooner-rigged steamer joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron upon arriving Hampton Roads on 28 April 1864. She was assigned to the critical New Inlet station in the blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina. She continued helping to seal off this important Confederate port until getting underway for the North on 17 August. The Nereus arrived in New York two days later for repairs. At this time Confederate cruiser CSS Tallahassee was alarming the North by the startling success of her operations against Union merchant shipping. Nereus departed New York on 3 September 1864, escorting the steamer SS North Star to Aspinwall with cargo to be carried overland across the Isthmus of Panama en route to California. She returned to New York on the 26th, for overdue repairs. Back in top trim, Nereus departed New York escorting to Hampton Roads. From Norfolk she towed the single-turret monitor to Wilmington for the attack on Fort Fisher. Arriving Christmas morning, Nereus joined in the bombardment of the Confederate works and supported the abortive amphibious attack until the last Union troops had re- embarked. Nereus remained in North Carolina waters until Rear Admiral Porter launched his successful attack against Fort Fisher on 13 January 1865. In the three-day struggle, a classic example of Army‚ÄîNavy coordination, Union soldiers, sailors, and marines, supported by the deadly effective fire from Porter's warships, overran Wilmington's defenses, closing the vital Confederate seaport. Nereus crewman Thomas Kane was awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry in this action. On 17 January, Nereus got underway towing the monitor to Charleston for final operations against the staunchly defended seaport which had witnessed the opening of hostilities almost four years before. Nereus then steamed to Beaufort for stores and coal before heading for the Bahamas and the Caribbean seeking to capture the Confederate cruiser Shenandoah which was still preying on northern merchantmen. She remained in the Caribbean until sailing north on 11 April, via Key West. She arrived New York 7 May decommissioned there on 15 May 1865, and was sold at public auction to James Hooper. Placed in commercial service as SS Somerset on 28 September 1865, the steamer operated as a merchant ship until 1881. John Henderson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, used her as part of the bidding process to win a mail service contract running between Baltimore and Liverpool. The railroad owned the Baltimore & Liverpool Steamship Co. under whose flag it operated such services. The Railroad bought 4 ships from the Navy; the other three vessels were the Allegany, The Carroll, and the Worcester; the Railroad decided to retain or change the names to Maryland counties.

It is one of three black lighthouses in the world, and the only one in the Southern Hemisphere. Together with the nearby white Queenscliff Low Light, it was built in 1862 to replace the former sandstone lighthouse of 1843 on the same site which was underpowered and deteriorating. The lightsource is located 40 metres above sea level (focal plane). Depending on the tower's bearing it emits either a fixed light or an occulting signal with an interval of 15 seconds. The black lighthouse is one of four in Queenscliff that are used as a leading line to guide ships through the notoriously dangerous mouth of Port Phillip Bay. History There are several conflicting accounts of where the basalt for the building came from. One version states that it came from Scotland as a ships ballast. In another version, the stone was quarried in Melbourne and shipped to Queenscliff. The fact that the stone was shipped may have led to the former theory's conception. The third version, according to current tour guides, is that the entire lighthouse was cut in Scotland, transported, and assembled on- site by numbers. The lighthouse was certainly designed in Scotland. Strangely, although Shortland's Bluff on which it is built is 20m or more above sea level, it was designed as a wave-washed lighthouse, with curved walls to deflect shock from waves, and with an entrance 5m above the base which is still visible. This entrance was used via a rope ladder for the first ten years until a ground-level door was cut. Fort Queenscliff was built around the lighthouse during the Australian Gold Rush after concerns that ships carrying gold might be susceptible to attack from privateers. The light was converted to gas in 1890, and then to electricity in 1924. It is supposed that the first public telephone service in Victoria was installed here. Today the lighthouse is unmanned and automated, and is serviced by the Port of Melbourne Corporation. Reference to The Lighthouse In Henry Handel Richardson's classic book, \\"The Getting of Wisdom\\" a vivid description is given of a ferry trip that bypasses the lighthouse in the late 1800s.

The molecule is a derivative of ammonia with trimethylsilyl groups in place of two hydrogen atoms. An electron diffraction study shows that silicon-nitrogen bond length (173.5 pm) and Si-N-Si bond angle (125.5¬∞) to be similar to disilazane (in which methyl groups are replaced by hydrogen atoms) suggesting that steric factors are not a factor in regulating angles in this case. This colorless liquid is a reagent and a precursor to bases that are popular in organic synthesis and organometallic chemistry. Additionally, HMDS is also increasingly used as molecular precursor in chemical vapor deposition techniques to deposit silicon carbonitride thin films or coatings. Synthesis and derivatives Bis(trimethylsilyl)amine is synthesized by treatment of trimethylsilyl chloride with ammonia: :2 (CH3)3SiCl + 3 NH3 ‚Üí [(CH3)3Si]2NH + 2 NH4Cl Ammonium nitrate together with triethylamine can be used instead. This method is also useful for 15N isotopic enrichment of HMDS. 700 px Alkali metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides result from the deprotonation of bis(trimethylsilyl)amine. For example, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) is prepared using n-butyllithium: :[(CH3)3Si]2NH + BuLi ‚Üí [(CH3)3Si]2NLi + BuH LiHMDS and other similar derivatives: sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (NaHMDS) and potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS) are used as a non-nucleophilic bases in synthetic organic chemistry. Use as reagent Hexamethyldisilazane is employed as a reagent in many organic reactions. 1) HMDS is used as a reagent in condensation reactions of heterocyclic compounds such as in the microwave synthesis of a derivative of xanthine: :HMDS application 2) The HMDS mediated trimethylsilylation of alcohols, thiols, amines and amino acids as protective groups or for intermediary organosilicon compounds is found to be very efficient and replaced TMSCl reagent. Silylation of glutamic acid with excess hexamethyldisilazane and catalytic TMSCl in either refluxing xylene or acetonitrile followed by dilution with alcohol (methanol or ethanol) yields the derived lactam pyroglutamic acid in good yield. 500 px HMDS in the presence of catalytic iodine facilitates the silylation of alcohols in excellent yields. 500 px 3) HMDS can be used to silylate laboratory glassware and make it hydrophobic, or automobile glass, just as Rain-X does. 4) In gas chromatography, HMDS can be used to silylate OH groups of organic compounds to increase volatility, this way enabling GC-analysis of chemicals that are otherwise non-volatile. Other uses In photolithography, HMDS is often used as an adhesion promoter for photoresists. Best results are obtained by applying HMDS from the gas phase on heated substrates. In electron microscopy, HMDS can be used as an alternative to critical point drying during sample preparation. In pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, HMDS is added to the analyte to create silylated diagnostic products during pyrolysis, in order to enhance detectability of compounds with polar functional groups. In plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), HMDS is used as a molecular precursor as a replacement to highly flammable and corrosive gasses like SiH4, CH4, NH3 as it can be easily handled. HMDS is used in conjunction with plasma (physics) of various gases such as argon, helium and nitrogen to deposit SiCN thin films/coatings with excellent mechanical, optical and electronic properties.

It became depopulated in April 1948 as a result of a military assault by the Alexandroni Brigade of the pre-state Israeli forces during the 1948 Palestine war.Morris, 2004, p. 217 The village lands would later be used by Israel as the Hiriya landfill. History At the time of Assyrian rule in Palestine, al-Khayriyya was known as Banai Berka and during Roman rule, it was known as by Beneberak. Late Roman and Byzantine ceramics have been found in the area.Dauphin, 1998, p. 822 In 938/9 a sanctuary was constructed in Al- Khayriyya, on the orders of the Qadi of Damascus.Sharon, 2013, pp. 294 -296 During the Crusader era it was known as Bombrac, mentioned in 1191 in the Itinerarium Regis Ricardi of King Richard I of England.Conder, 1875, p. 92 =Ottoman era= In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596 the village, called Hayriyya, appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as being in the nahiya of Ramla (liwa¬¥ of Gaza), with a population of 28 Muslim households, an estimated 154 persons. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, fruits and sesame, as well as on other types of property, such as goats, beehives and vineyards; a total of 4,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 153. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 248. Later in the Ottoman period the village was called Ibn Ibraq, preserving the ancient name.\\"The son of Ibraq\\", according to Palmer, 1881, p. 214Freedman, 2000, p. 165Cancik et al., 1996, p. 484. An Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that Jabrak had a population of 208, in 68 houses, though the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 155Hartmann, 1883, p. 136, also noted 68 houses In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village, then named Ibn Ibrak, as \\"an ordinary mud village\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 251 =British Mandate era= At the time of the British Mandate for Palestine the villagers changed the name of the village to al-Khayriyya to distinguish it from the newly-established neighbouring Jewish town of Bnei Brak. The population was predominantly Muslim with twenty Christians. A school for boys was established in 1920, and it had a plot of 8 dunums of land attached to it for agricultural training. A school for girls was founded in 1945. By 1946, there were 183 boys and 69 girls in these schools.Khalidi, 1992, p. 248. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Khairiyeh had a population of 546, 5 Christians and the rest Muslims.Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jaffa, p. 20 In the 1931 census the population of El Kheiriya had increased to 914, 5 Christians and the rest Muslims, in 212 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 14 El Kheiriye 1928 (Ibn Ibraq), 1:20,000 Al-Khayriyya (Kheiriya) 1945 1:250,000 The villagers worked primarily in agriculture and animal husbandry. In the 1945 statistics the population of Al-Khayriyya was 1,420: 1,400 Muslims and 20 Christians, with 13,672 dunams of land. Of this, a total of 3,359 dunams of village land was used for citrus and bananas and 2,355 dunums for cereals, while 1,275 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards. Numerous artesian wells supplied them with irrigation water.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 96 26 dunams were classified as built-up (urban) areas.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 146 The Jewish settlement of Kfar Azar was established on what was traditionally village land in 1932. =1948 War and State of Israel= Landfill in Israel, where the old village of Al-Khayriyya once stood Site of old village (now a landfill) According to the Palestine Post, in early 1948, the village residents repeatedly attacked the nearby Ef'al settlement. The newspaper also reported that on 16 February 1948, the Haganah blew up a two-story house that was used by snipers against Ef'al. The village of Al-Khayriyya was depopulated in the weeks leading up to the 1948 Palestine war, during the Haganah's offensive Mivtza Hametz (Operation Hametz) 28‚Äì30 April 1948. This operation was held against a group of villages east of Jaffa, including Al-Khayriyya. According to the preparatory orders, the objective was to \\"opening the way [for Jewish forces] to Lydda\\". Though there was no explicit mention of the prospective treatment of the villagers, the order spoke of \\"cleansing the area\\" [tihur hashetah].HGS\\\\Operations to Alexandroni, etc., \\"Orders for Operation \\"Hametz\\", 26 Apr. 1948.

Cited in Morris, 2004, pp. 217, 286 The Alexandroni Brigade 32nd Battalion reported that they found and buried the bodies of four adult men and three women in the village, and briefly detained a handful of men, women and children. Two of the adult male villagers were charged with having killed a Haganah man, and they were then promptly executed. Following the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. In 1952 and 1969 the villages of Ramat Pinkas and Ramat Ef'al, respectively, were established on village land, north of the village site. Both are now part of the suburbs of Giv'atayim.Khalidi, 1992, p. 249 Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village remains in 1992: \\"A handful of houses and one of the schools remain. One deserted house, surrounded by shrubs and wild vegetation, has simple architecture: a rectangular door, small side windows, and a flat roof. A two-storey house, identified as having belonged to Ahmad al-Tibi, is used as a store. It has rectangular doors and windows and a gabled roof. Cypress, fig, Christ's-thorn, and orange trees grow on the site. Part of the adjacent land is cultivated and the rest is occupied by buildings.\\" The village lands were later designated for a landfill known as Hiriya.

He married Cecile Geniets from a butcher's family. He was a pupil of his cousin Salmier and a member of the Guild of St. Luke in his own city in 1624. In 1646 he moved to Roermond, where in 1647 he was received a member of the Guild of St. Luke. He had a successful career in Roermond as he enjoyed the patronage of prominent clients, including the bishop. He died in Roermond in 1663. David Herregouts had four sons named Hendrik, Willem, Jan Baptist and Maximilian who became painters. His chief work, \\"St. Joseph Awakened by an Angel\\", was painted for the church of St. Catherine in Mechelen.

Here he had to join the local Guild of Saint Luke. Around 1679‚Äì1680, he had again a workshop in Antwerp. His younger brother Jan Baptist likely joined him in his workshop in Antwerp. He became a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1677. Between the years 1680 and 1690 he lived for several years in Bruges, where he was possibly joined by his brother Jan Baptist to assist with some of the religious and secular commissions he was completing in that city. He probably intermittently travelled to Italy. He was given the nickname 'Romein' (the 'Roman') because of his close connection to Italy. His marriage was reportedly not happy and he separated from his wife. After the death of his first wife, he married a second time in Antwerp in 1682. His second wife was Nathalie Godijn, likely the sister of his pupil Abraham Godijn. In 1685 he received a commission from the Confrerie of the Holy Sacrement to design a triumphal arch to commemorate the centenary of the restoration of the Catholic cult in the St. James' Church, Antwerp. His pupils included Abraham Godijn, Martinus van Nies (1679-1680); Alouysius Sammels and Cornelis Henricus van Meurs (1693-1694).Hendrik Herregouts at the RKD He died at an elevated age in Antwerp. Work The Triumph of the Cross Hendrik Herregouts was highly regarded in his time and he received many commissions for altarpieces and religious works in Flanders and abroad. He was also known as a portrait painter. The majority of his works can be found in churches in Antwerp, Bruges, Mechelen and Cologne. A number of his works in Cologne were lost during World War II. He was influenced by the palette of various artists such as Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens as well as by Italian painters such as Titian, Rafael and Caravaggio. Poussin was important as an influence on his classicizing style and overall composition. His works are often on a grand scale and complex. His masterpiece is the Last Judgement in the Church of Saint Anne in Bruges, a very large-scale composition completed in 1685. The colossal figures in the work are reminiscent of the Mannerist painter Raphael Coxie.Last Judgement in the Church of Saint Anne in Bruges at the RKD A Martyrdom of Saint Matthew, originally painted for the Antwerp Cathedral is now in the St. Paul's Church, Antwerp.Martyrdom of Saint Matthew in the St. Paul's Church, Antwerp A Divine Friend of Children dated 1680 in the G√∂ttweig Abbey near Krems in Lower Austria shows his mastery of colour and composition. He painted many portraits. His portraits are characterized by their blunt directness and lively immediacy. An example is the Portrait of Franciscus Wynckelman, voogd 1709-25 at the Hans Memlingmuseum in Bruges.Portrait of Franciscus Wynckelman, voogd 1709-25 at the Hans Memlingmuseum He also often collaborated with other painters. He painted the staffage in the landscapes of Jan Asselijn. In his later years, he collaborated with still life painters Gaspar Peeter Verbruggen the Younger, Simon Hardim√© and Jan Baptist Bosschaert who painted flowers around putti and nymphs painted by Herregouts. He provided designs for publications by Antwerp and international printers.

Postal service began in 1877. The Methodist Conference of Churches selected Whitt as its site for its district high school, Parker Institute. In the mid-1880s Whitt had an estimated 150 residents, three churches, a school, a weekly newspaper called the Whitt Moon, and twenty businesses. Whitt continued to grow quickly and by 1900 it had a population of 500. . Whitt's population dwindled in the early 1990s due new railroads that bypassed many small towns in Parker County coupled with effects of the Great Depression. The Whitt Seminary was founded in 1880, when elders of the Christian Church at Whitt purchased five acres of land to build a community school. The Seminary offered elementary through high school education with a robust music department, serving close to 200 students from local and surrounding communities.. The school served the community until 1990. The old Seminary building functioned as a Christian church until 1937, and then turned into a community center.

It is used to treat testicular cancer, as well as to help establish the exact stage and type of the cancer.  Indications  Testicular cancer metastasizes in a predictable pattern, and lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum are typically the first place it lands. By examining the removed lymphatic tissue, a pathologist can determine whether the disease has spread. If no malignant tissue is found, the cancer can be labeled Stage I, limited to the testicle. The procedure is common in the treatment of Stage I and II non-seminomatous germ cell tumors. In seminomas, another form of testicular cancer, radiation therapy is generally preferred to the invasive RPLND procedure. Whether RPLND is needed after orchiectomy depends on the type of tumor and its stage. RPLND may be performed to remove tumor remnants that persist after chemotherapy, because these remnants might otherwise spread and become resistant to the chemotherapy agents previously used. Chemotherapy may be administered before RPLND and, if successful, may render surgery unnecessary. However, if the cancer does recur, surgery is much more difficult in a patient previously treated with chemotherapy.  Procedure  RPLND is usually performed using an incision that extends from the sternum to several inches below the navel. A less invasive procedure (L-RPLND) can be performed laparoscopically, but this is more costly and time-consuming, and requires specialized equipment that not every hospital has. Additionally, it is unclear whether L-RPLND is as effective as the standard, open procedure.  Complications  Potential complications of RPLND include damage to the sympathetic nerves running parallel to the spinal cord, which can result in retrograde ejaculation and infertility. Contrary to popular belief, erectile function is not compromised by RPLND because the nerves responsible for erection are located elsewhere. As with any major surgery, infection is a possibility, as are bowel obstructions and adhesions.

Its primary purpose was to serve the State Coal Mine but the line also provided passenger and general goods services. The line was opened in 1910 and closed in 1978. Background In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Victorian Railways depended on black coal to fire its steam locomotives. Although black coal deposits around Korumburra in South Gippsland had been exploited since 1891, the seams were narrow, costs of production were relatively high, and in 1900 their production accounted for just a quarter of Victoria's consumption. It was cheaper for VR to purchase coal from Newcastle, New South Wales, however a protracted miners dispute in 1909 threatened supplies and led to an even stronger commitment by the Murray Government to securing local supplies.Lee, p.132 With the Korumburra mines unable to meet Victorian Railways' demand for 1000 tons of coal a day, a promising seam on the Powlett River which had been tested in 1908 was rapidly developed as a mine site and the government opened the mine for commercial purposes in 1909. While the first shipments were taken by sea from Inverloch, a railway was rapidly constructed to service the new mine. Construction Originally known as the \\"Powlett River railway\\", the Wonthaggi line was built extremely rapidly. A branch line from Nyora to Woolamai had already been approved, branching from the South Gippsland line (the Great Southern Railway) just east of Nyora railway station, but work had not started. In December 1909, a extension of the branch from Woolamai to the Powlett River coalfield was given parliamentary sanction. The line carried its first coal in February 1910, with Baldwin-built 4-6-0 locomotive W 227 given the honour of hauling the first train from the Powlett coalfield. As well as passenger and general goods stations to service the rapidly growing town of Wonthaggi, connections were provided to the State Mine (on the up side of Wonthaggi) and to later additional mine extensions at Dudley and Kirrak. Traffic The mine's production grew rapidly and at its peak in 1926 produced per day, with Victorian Railways buying 90% of production. By 1928, twelve return passenger services also ran on the line per week, with a journey time from Flinders Street station to Wonthaggi taking approximately four hours. The introduction of diesel rail motors in the 1950s saw a reduction in journey times for passenger services on the line to around three hours by 1954, but service frequency was now eleven return passenger services operating per week. Decline and closure The conversion of Victorian Railways from steam to diesel-electric power during the 1950s and 1960s reduced demand for black coal and in 1968 the mine closed. Passenger services from Nyora to Wonthaggi were withdrawn on 4 December 1977 with the last train being a 153hp Walker railmotor. By this time the general decline of Victorian branch line network saw services being withdrawn from a number of lines, and the Wonthaggi line closed on 21 November 1978Lee, p.252 when a final goods train returned to Melbourne with staff equipment from stations along the line. The track was dismantled in 1988 and the southern section from Anderson to Wonthaggi has been developed as the Bass Coast Rail Trail.

The dukedom was bestowed by King Juan Carlos on Adolfo Suarez Gonz√°lez on 25 February 1981, following his resignation as Spanish Prime Minister, in recognition of his role in the Spanish transition to democracy. The Duke of Su√°rez is also a Grandee of Spain. The current holder of the title is Alejandra Romero Su√°rez, Adolfo Su√°rez's granddaughter. Unsuccessful petition Shortly after the first Duke's death in 2014, it was reported that in 2009 his son Adolfo Su√°rez Illana had unsuccessfully written to King Juan Carlos I to ask him to use the supposed historic powers of the Crown to alter the legal line of succession to make him heir to his father's title of Duke of Su√°rez instead of his niece Alejandra Su√°rez Romero, daughter and heir of Mariam Su√°rez Illana (his father's eldest child, who had died in 2004). This was on the basis that, although he himself cared little or nothing for the title, this had been the repeatedly expressed desire of his father, supported by the depositions of five witnesses. His father allegedly wanted the Dukes of Su√°rez to have his surname Su√°rez for many future generations, but Alzheimer's disease had made him both unable to decide the succession himself (as is permitted by Spanish law through Succession by Assignment), and also made him unaware that in 2006 the Equity Act for the Succession of Titles of Nobility () had removed male- preference cognatic primogeniture, thereby ensuring that the title would pass to his granddaughter rather than to his son. The failure of the petition was unsurprising given that the Royal family itself had already expressed its support for a constitutional change to eliminate the preference for male rather than female succession to the Spanish throne, a matter which Socialist Prime Minister, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero included in his inaugural speech in 2004.

He played in the NFL for the Washington Redskins and Oakland Raiders in 3 preseason games during the 2007 season but was cut on September 2 before the start of the regular season. While with Oakland, he connected on a 49-yard field goal versus the Arizona Cardinals and handled all punting and placekicking duties during the team's final preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks (avg. 49 yds on five punts). He signed a three-year deal (to have kept him in Los Angeles through the 2010 season) with the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League on April 24, midway through the 2008 season. He played in their final eight games. In early 2015, he was a contestant on the 30th season of the reality show Survivor. He was eliminated in seventh place. Early life Born to parents Mark Fredrickson and Mimi Lessett, Fredrickson attended Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California, where he played both football and soccer. He has a sister named Taryn. As a senior, he was named second team All-CIF Southern Section punter as a senior. As a placekicker, he once booted three field goals, including the game-winner with four seconds left, to beat Cabrillo High School, 9-7. As a soccer player, he was a four-time all-league performer. College career At the University of California, Berkeley, Fredrickson was the Golden Bears‚Äô starting punter for three seasons and doubled as the placekicker as a senior in 2003. Fredrickson punted 198 times for Cal, averaging 39.4 yards per boot. While handling the placekicking duties, he converted on attempts from 51 and 53 yards out, registering the third and fifth-longest field goals in Golden Bear history. Professional career =NFL attempts= Fredrickson only played pre-season NFL games, never starting in a regular season pro-game. Fredrickson signed a free agent contract with the Seattle Seahawks following the 2004 NFL Draft, but was waived during training camp, after kicking on Monday Night Football versus the Green Bay Packers. A year later, he was in training camp with the Denver Broncos, followed by a stint in NFL Europe with the Amsterdam Admirals. In 2006, Fredrickson re-signed with the Broncos, only to be released once again prior to the start of training camp. Six days later he was picked up by the Dallas Cowboys and kicked a 49-yard field goal during a preseason Monday Night Football game versus the New Orleans Saints before being released. Prior to the start of the 2007 NFL season, he spent time with both the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders. Fredrickson has also had tryouts with the Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets, Tennessee Titans, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Kansas City Chiefs. =Los Angeles Avengers= Fredrickson signed with the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football League on April 24, 2008, midway through the season. He played in their final eight games. Survivor In 2014, Fredrickson competed on Survivor: Worlds Apart, the 30th season of American television show Survivor. It premiered on February 25, 2015. He placed seventh, lasted 32 out of 39 days, was the 12th person voted out, and became the fifth jury member. Fredrickson began the game on the Masaya (White Collar) tribe and quickly formed an alliance with Joaquin Souberbielle and Carolyn Rivera. Upon the tribal switch, he was assigned to Escameca and would join up with Souberbielle and former Blue Collar tribe member Rodney Lavoie, Jr., in a new alliance, but would lose Souberbielle who would be voted out on a blindside. Post-merge, Fredrickson would be part of a six-member alliance of himself, Rivera, Lavoie, Will Sims II, Dan Foley, and Sierra Thomas. This alliance would eliminate all the former No Collar tribe members (apart from Sims), and set their sights on eliminating the biggest threat in the game: Mike Holloway. However, Holloway saved himself repeatedly with immunity wins, and when he played his Hidden Immunity Idol, Fredrickson found himself betrayed by his closest ally Rivera and voted out of the game with three votes (four votes against Holloway all negated by the Idol). Rivera would justify the betrayal at Final Tribal Council by saying she knew that Fredrickson was one of the biggest jury threats and could win the game. He appeared satisfied with the explanation, but he still chose to vote for Holloway to win. Post-football career During his senior year at Cal, Fredrickson directed, edited, and starred in the documentary Countdown to Kickoff 2003, about the 2003 California Golden Bears football team. In 2010, he received his second master's degree after graduating from the Peter Stark Producing Program at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Prior to Survivor, he worked at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), a prominent entertainment and sports agency headquartered in Los Angeles.

Accessed 15 August 2015 (The other is Kit Fielding of Break In and Bolt.) Character biography Halley was born out of wedlock. His mother's fianc√© died at age 20 (though a newspaper report in Come to Grief says he was 19) only three days before the wedding in a fall from a ladder, whilst working overtime as a window cleaner. Eight months after his father's death Halley was born. Halley's mother, aged 19 at his birth, came from the Liverpool slums and later worked as a biscuit packer. Halley's boyhood home was Liverpool. His mother died when Halley was 15 of an obscure kidney ailment. Knowing she was dying, she pulled Halley from grammar school and apprenticed him to a Newmarket racing trainer, so that he would have a home and someone to turn to after her death. Halley's elderly master taught him to train horses and encouraged him to invest the money that he earned. He also educated Sid in speech, manners, and the realities of life. Sid was a rising jockey by the time he completed his indentured service, and was reputed to have earned a small fortune on the stock market. Halley became a successful jockey, rising to become champion jockey ‚Äî a status he held for \\"five or six years\\". During his early career, before he achieved success, he married Jenny Roland, daughter of retired Rear Admiral Charles Roland. The marriage produced no children and was never a great success. While Halley was Champion Jockey his wife gave him an ultimatum: racing or her. Halley chose racing. They separated while Halley was still racing and a divorce followed between the events of the first two books. Despite this Halley had become close to Charles Roland (after a very rocky start) and the friendship persisted. Halley was injured in a racing accident: after a fall a horse stepped directly on his left hand. His hand was crippled, ending his racing career. Despite several operations the hand had little utility. No longer able to race, Halley was hired as an operative by a well- known private security/investigative firm called Hunt Radnor Associates, and is working there as Odds Against opens. Still pitying himself over the loss of the profession he loved, and the loss of a wife he loved but couldn't get along with, he does not work very hard at being a detective, but a case involving unexplained accidents at a venerable racetrack awakens his interest, and, when he brings the case to a successful conclusion, he discovers he might be as good an investigator as he was a jockey. But at a cost. In the course of his investigation, his hand was further damaged by the villain he was trying to expose, resulting in its amputation. Odds Against earned Dick Francis his first nomination for an MWA Edgar Award for Best Novel. Throughout most of the rest of the series Halley struggles to come to terms with the loss of his hand, and to master the prosthetic device that has replaced it. In the first sequel, Whip Hand, Halley has been fitted with an artificial left hand. He and his partner, Chico Barnes, no longer working for Hunt Radnor Associates, have opened their own detective agency, and, in quick succession, are hired to investigate three unrelated cases. In the course of this novel, Halley is threatened with the loss of his remaining hand. Whip Hand won both the MWA Edgar and the CWA Gold Dagger for Best Novel, one of only two novels ever to win both awards, the other being John le Carr√©'s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. By Come to Grief, Halley's agency has become a sole proprietorship, after Barnes, newly married, leaves the firm at the behest of his bride. Halley becomes a public pariah when, in the course of an investigation into several shocking cases of animal cruelty, he uncovers evidence that the responsible party is a well-known, and extremely popular, TV sports journalist. Come to Grief also won an Edgar for Best Novel, making Halley the only detective-hero in fiction to be featured in two novels that won the Edgar for best novel, and the only one to headline a series for which every single entry (to that point) was an Edgar finalist in the Best Novel category. In the fourth book in the series, Under Orders, Sid marries Marina Van Der Meer. This book was noteworthy for not being nominated for an Edgar, ending Francis's streak. Refusal, though written in 2013 by Dick's son Felix, carries the sur- title \\"A Dick Francis Novel.\\" In it the now 47-year-old Halley is father to a six-year-old daughter, Saskia, and has given up detective work. In order to protect his family from the attentions of a crooked and violent bookmaker he is reluctantly drawn back to his old profession. During the novel the possibility of a hand transplant is mooted and the book ends with Halley being told that donor hand has become available.  Adaptation  Sid Halley was played by Mike Gwilym in a six episode television series, The Racing Game. The series was produced by Yorkshire Television and aired between November 1979 and January 1980. The first episode was a brief adaptation of Odds Against; the other episodes were original stories created for the series by various writers. In his autobiography, The Sport of Queens, Dick Francis says he owes the existence of Whip Hand to Mike Gwilym's performance. The actor so closely matched Francis's concept of Halley that he became interested in writing a second book about the same man. It was filmed mainly in Yorkshire at the Pontefract, York and Wetherby racecourses predominantly. The first episode featured a young John Collings Snr as a member of the crowd.

Intuitively, a strictly positive measure is one that is \\"nowhere zero\\", or that is zero \\"only on points\\". Definition Let (X, T) be a Hausdorff topological space and let Œ£ be a œÉ-algebra on X that contains the topology T (so that every open set is a measurable set, and Œ£ is at least as fine as the Borel œÉ-algebra on X). Then a measure Œº on (X, Œ£) is called strictly positive if every non-empty open subset of X has strictly positive measure. In more condensed notation, Œº is strictly positive if and only if :\\\\forall U \\\\in T \\\\mbox{ s.t. } U eq \\\\emptyset, \\\\mu (U) > 0. Examples * Counting measure on any set X (with any topology) is strictly positive. * Dirac measure is usually not strictly positive unless the topology T is particularly \\"coarse\\" (contains \\"few\\" sets). For example, Œ¥0 on the real line R with its usual Borel topology and œÉ-algebra is not strictly positive; however, if R is equipped with the trivial topology T = {‚àÖ, R}, then Œ¥0 is strictly positive. This example illustrates the importance of the topology in determining strict positivity. * Gaussian measure on Euclidean space Rn (with its Borel topology and œÉ-algebra) is strictly positive.  Wiener measure on the space of continuous paths in Rn is a strictly positive measure -- Wiener measure is an example of a Gaussian measure on an infinite-dimensional space. * Lebesgue measure on Rn (with its Borel topology and œÉ-algebra) is strictly positive. * The trivial measure is never strictly positive, regardless of the space X or the topology used, except when X is empty. Properties * If Œº and ŒΩ are two measures on a measurable topological space (X, Œ£), with Œº strictly positive and also absolutely continuous with respect to ŒΩ, then ŒΩ is strictly positive as well. The proof is simple: let U ‚äÜ X be an arbitrary open set; since Œº is strictly positive, Œº(U) > 0; by absolute continuity, ŒΩ(U) > 0 as well. * Hence, strict positivity is an invariant with respect to equivalence of measures. See also * Support (measure theory): a measure is strictly positive if and only if its support is the whole space.

His novels include The Godfather Returns, Crooked River Burning, and The Veracruz Blues. He published a collection of short stories, That's True of Everybody, in 2002. His newest novel, The Godfather's Revenge, was published in November 2006 by Putnam. His Godfather novels continue the story of the Corleone family depicted in Mario Puzo's The Godfather.  Overview  He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from Miami University and went on to receive a master of fine arts degree in fiction writing from George Mason University. He published his first book at age 26, while still in graduate school. He has taught at Miami, George Mason, George Washington, and John Carroll University, and is currently the Burroway Professor of English. He was formerly the Director of the Creative Writing Program at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida. Winegardner has won grants, fellowships and residencies from the Ohio Arts Council, the Lilly Endowment, the Ragdale Foundation, the Sewanee Writers Conference and the Corporation of Yaddo. His books have been chosen as among the best of the year by the New York Times Book Review, Chicago Sun-Times, Los Angeles Times, the New York Public Library, and USA Today. His work has appeared in GQ, Playboy, Ploughshares, TriQuarterly, DoubleTake, Family Circle, The Sporting News, Witness, Story Quarterly, American Short Fiction, Ladies Home Journal, Parents and The New York Times Magazine. Several of his stories have been chosen as Distinguished Stories of the Year in The Best American Short Stories. He is an alumnus of the Ragdale Foundation. Analysis According to a press release from Putnam: In a major acquisition, G. P. Putnam's Sons Executive Editor Dan Conaway secured North American rights to The Godfather's Revenge, the capstone to the Corleone family saga, which began with Mario Puzo's landmark novel and was carried forward in Winegardner's 2004 New York Times bestseller, The Godfather Returns. The Godfather's Revenge was written by Winegardner, based on Puzo's original characters. \\"It's staggering to contemplate the legacy of the Godfather films and novels,\\" says Dan Conaway. \\"They have had a deeper, broader and more lasting impact on the fabric of contemporary culture than has any other such franchise in the past 50 years. It's fitting, then, that The Godfather's Revenge overlays the resonant mythology of the Corleone family onto the most vexing real-life mystery of our age, with a storyline that explores the role organized crime may have had in the assassination of a charismatic young President.\\" Ohio Center for the Book at Cleveland Public Library Publications *Winegardner, Mark.

Written by Allison Burnett, the film follows a successful middle-aged restaurateur and womanizer who falls in love with a sweet young woman who is terminally ill. Plot Will Keane (Richard Gere) is a successful 48-year-old restaurateur and womanizer who is the subject of a recent New York magazine cover story. Charlotte Fielding (Winona Ryder) is a free-spirited, 22-year-old woman brought to Will's upscale restaurant by her grandmother and friends to celebrate her birthday. Will notices her immediately and her grandmother, an old friend of his, introduces them. Will admires the hats she made for the occasion and is surprised to learn that Charlotte is the daughter of one of his old girlfriends, Katy, who died in a car accident. The next day, Will calls and asks Charlotte to make a hat for his date to an upcoming benefit dinner. A few days later, she delivers the hat to his apartment. Stood up by his date, he invites her to accompany him to the formal benefit. There they dance, get to know each other and later end up back at his apartment where they have sex. The next morning, while having breakfast on his terrace, Will explains that their relationship has no future. She acknowledges this, revealing she is dying from a heart condition. Later, Will tells his friend, John Volpe (Anthony LaPaglia), about his interest in Charlotte. The next day, Will calls on Charlotte and they go out together. They talk about their age difference and her illness. As they walk through the beautiful fall foliage in Central Park, Charlotte recites lines from the poem \\"God's World\\" by Edna St. Vincent Millay. As they talk, she notices him checking his watch, and she takes it from his wrist, saying she'll return it when he forgets that she has it. At his restaurant, they continue to get to know each other while preparing a meal for his staff. Watching her among his friends, he begins to fall in love. Back at his apartment, Charlotte experiences severe heart pain. At the hospital, Will learns from the doctor that she is suffering from neuroblastoma, a rare illness in adults, which in her case produced a tumor near her heart. She has perhaps a year to live. In the coming days, their relationship grows and she learns more about him. When she asks why he is so interested in food, Will responds, \\"Food is the only beautiful thing that truly nourishes.\\" At a Halloween party, Charlotte, dressed as Emily Dickinson, entertains children by reciting lines from one of Dickinson's poems and bringing the words to life with butterflies on her fingers: \\"Two butterflies went out at noon and waltzed above a stream, then stepped straight through the firmament and rested on a beam; and then together bore away upon a shining sea ‚Äì though never yet, in any port, their coming mentioned be.\\" Meanwhile, in another room, Will meets a former girlfriend and the two end up on the roof having sex. Later, Charlotte suspects that he was unfaithful, and after denying it, he acknowledges his actions. Charlotte breaks off their relationship. They are both deeply affected by the breakup. Meanwhile, Will receives a letter from Lisa Tyler (Vera Farmiga), the illegitimate daughter he's never met. He goes to the museum where she works and recognizes her from an old photo, but he is unable to approach her. A few nights later he arrives home and Lisa is waiting for him in the lobby; they talk for the first time. She is pregnant and has become sentimental about parenthood, wanting just to meet her own father. She tells him about a dream she's had, that he's been trying to find her all these years in order to say he was sorry for abandoning her. Will says quietly, \\"Yes I am.\\" The next day, Will is walking through Central Park and steps over a fence onto a path, leaving behind some children playing beneath a tree. That night, Charlotte returns to her apartment and finds Will asleep in her chair. Angry at first, she tells him to leave, but he apologizes and pleads to be given another chance ‚Äì to let him love her again. She cries as he holds her in his arms, and later that night they make love. In the morning, Charlotte recites to him lines from a poem: \\"The stars are soft as flowers, and as near; the hills are webs of shadow, slowly spun; no separate leaf or single blade is here ‚Äì all blend to one.\\" Later, while skating at Rockefeller Center, Charlotte suddenly collapses on the ice. At the hospital, Will learns that the tumor has progressed and that she may only have a few weeks to live. In the coming days, Will searches for a specialist who can perform the necessary heroic surgery to save her life. He turns to his daughter for help, and she finds a specialist who agrees to perform the surgery when the time comes. On Christmas morning, Charlotte wakes up and hears Will decorating the house and terrace. As she prepares to bring him his Christmas gift, Charlotte collapses. She is rushed to the hospital and the specialist is called. At the hospital, Will comes to her side and whispers to her lines from a poem: \\"Time cannot break the bird's wing from the bird. Bird and wing together go down, one feather. No thing that ever flew, not the lark, not you, can die as others do.\\" Their hands separate as Charlotte is taken to the operating room. Will, his friends, Lisa, and Charlotte's grandmother wait during the long hours of surgery. Outside the hospital, seagulls fly off into the snowy skies over the city. Finally, the specialist emerges from surgery, and as he approaches it is clear from his expression that he could not save her. Back at his apartment, Will finds Charlotte's Christmas gift lying on the floor ‚Äì a small box with the hat stem she designed for him.

The site's general consensus reads, \\"Although the film isn't as bad as feared (it wasn't pre- screened for reviews), it's not that good, either. Most noticeable flaws are the sappy romantic cliches and lack of chemistry between Gere and Ryder.\\" On Metacritic, the film scored a 24 out of 100 rating, based on 21 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". The film was nominated for a Razzie Award in 2001 for Worst Screen Couple (Richard Gere and Winona Ryder), but did not win the award. Emanuel Levy of Variety gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"Autumn in New York is not a bad picture, just utterly banal. Desperately eager to register as a love affair in the mold of Hollywood's classics, Joan Chen's tediously sappy romantic meller is a kind of modern-day Love Story, with a \\"new\\" twist: The casting of Richard Gere as a suave lover old enough to be Winona Ryder's father. MGM release, which went into theaters without a press screening, should enjoy a decent opening due to an aggressive marketing campaign targeted at young susceptible femmes, but tearjerker should be out of sight long before the season in which its pedestrian story is set.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote: \\"It's unfortunate that the film was directed by Joan Chen, who made the shattering Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl. The gentle humanism of Chen's touch is much in evidence here, yet she can't undo the howler at the movie's center ‚Äì namely, that Gere's serial dater has conveniently chosen to fall in love with the one young woman in Manhattan who won't be around in six months anyway.\\". Peter Rainer of NYmag wrote that Joan Chen had a 'lovely sense of film rhythm and a sophisticated eye for luxe effects, but she fell into a vat of goo and there's no climbing out of it'.

The engagement ending with the destruction of the Maratha forces, and a tactical victory for the Bijapur Sultanate, but failing to achieve a strategic victory. Background In 1660, the Maratha King Shivaji was trapped in the fort of Panhala, under siege and vastly outnumbered by an Adilshahi army led by an Abyssinian named Siddi Masud. The Adilshahis were the invaders which ruled Bijapur for few years. The ruler at the time was Ali Adil Shah II. Adilshahi, having suffered several defeats from Shivaji, and even though they were at odds with Mughals, had aligned with the Mughals to temper Shivaji's ambition. Baji Prabhu Deshpande managed to engage a large Adilshahi army with 300 soldiers, while Shivaji managed to escape the siege. Prelude Shivaji planned to escape to the fort of Vishalgadh, which was administered by a Maratha chieftain named Range Narayan Orpe under Shivaji. Two Maratha sardars of the Adilshahi Commander Siddi Jouhar namely Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalvi had also encircled the fort of Vishalgadh simultaneously. Shivaji waited for months, planning and depleting the Adilshah's food source. He waited until he reckoned that they needed to gather more food, and then started his plan. Shivaji, Baji Prabhu, and around 600 of their best troops, hardened mountaineers of the Maval region, would dash through the Adilshahi force at night. A man named Shiva Kashid, who resembled Shivajiin appearance, had volunteered to dress like the king and get captured. It was envisaged that this would buy some additional time due to the confusion over identity, before Siddi Masud realised the error and gave chase. Baji Prabhu Deshpande Statue in Panhala Fort Shivaji made his escape on the dark night of 13 July, with his contingent of troops. Baji Prabhu was second in command of this contingent. The Adilshahis gave hot and rapid pursuit, with an army of 10,000. It was clear that there was no way to shake off the enemy, and that the Marathas would not simultaneously prevail over both the Moghul garrison at Vishagadh and the chasing Adilshahi army. The only option was for a section of the Marathas to stay back and fight the larger Adilshahi forces in a rearguard action, while the rest of the Marathas would carry on to their destination. Shivaji decided that this was the inevitable choice and split his forces. Baji Prabhu Deshpande agreed to face the troops of Bijapur with 300 soldiers of the contingent. Shivaji told Baji Prabhu that he would hear the cannon fire from Vishalgadh (the destination fort), signalling Shivaji‚Äôs safety. The strategic position of Ghod Khind (Horse Pass) was chosen for the defence. It was very narrow and only a few soldiers could pass at any one time. Battle Bajiprabhu Deshpande occupied Ghod Khind, blocking the path of the pursuers, and made a determined defence against them. His brother Fulaji Prabhu as well as sardars such as Shambusing Jadhav were present with him. Fulaji Prabhu and Shambusing were killed after a gallant and fierce fights. Baji Prabhu was severely wounded but carried on fighting at his station. The Adilshahi army repeatedly tried to break through the defenses of the pass, but were repeatedly repulsed. The unequal battle raged for hours, with the defenders maintaining their positions, but with rapidly depleting numbers. Only a handful of Marathas survived, and around a thousand soldiers of the Adilshahi army became casualties in attempting to take the pass. Five hours after the battle started, the cannon fire announcing Shivaj‚Äôs safe return to Vishalgadh was heard. Almost three hundred Marathas had been killed. Legend has it that a gravely injured Baji Prabhu continued engaging the enemy and held the pass, only laying down his life once he heard the sound of cannon fire. The handful surviving Marathas then retreated and disappeared in the forest as per the plan. On the other hand Shivaji and his 300 soldiers had to break through the encirclement of Suryarao and Jaswantrao at Vishalgadh. A fierce battle ensued in which Shivaji himself fought wearing Dandpatta in his both hands. Seeing this fight, the commander of Vishalgadh fort sent help to Shivaji enabling him and his troops to reach the fort safely. Shivaji then fired cannons as a signal for Baji Prabhu to retreat. Aftermath Shivaji‚Äôs plan was successful. Having made his way to Vishalgadh, Rango Narayan Orpe had fresh troops at his disposal. Baji Prabhu had successfully fought the rearguard action and slowed the Adilshahis forces before they arrived at the fort having carried on pursuing Shivaji to Vishalgadh. The vengeful fresh Maratha troops carried out a blazing and bloody attack against Siddi Masood, Jasawantaro and Suryarao's forces inflicting heavy losses upon the latter when they arrived at the fort. The Adilshahi forces fled as a result of this attack. One Maratha chronicler describes this fierce attack by mentioning that the 'green valleys of Vishalgadh were painted in red due to enemy's blood'. Shivaji then safely crossed the western ghats and reached his capital Rajgad via Konkan region. Shivaji later personally visited the house of the slain Baji Prabhu, which was in the village of Kasabe Sindh in the Raigad district and honoured his family, including giving his eldest son a position of leadership and honour in the forces. The defence of the pass of Ghod Khind by about 300 Marathas led by the Baji Prabhu Deshpande was renamed ‚ÄúThe Battle of Pavan Khind‚Äù which in Marathi means ‚ÄúThe Battle of the Sacred Pass‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe defence‚Ä¶,‚Äù says historian Dennis Kincaid, ‚Äúhas become legendary in Western India. The action is remarkable as an example of the spirit which Chhatrapati Shivaji‚Äôs leadership infused into his followers.‚Äù Shivaji‚Äôs mother, Jijabai, wept at the news of Baji Prabhu‚Äôs death. Ballads and poems have been composed in his memory, some of which are still sung today. Sri Aurobindo, the great yogi, mystic and revolutionary of the 20th century wrote a poem dedicated to Baji Prabhu, which was used as a symbol to capture the spirit of sacrifice that was required of the young men in India‚Äôs freedom struggle which was then under way. Historian Jadunath Sarkar describes the incident in his book \\"Chhatrapati Shivaji and His Times\\" in the following way. The siege dragged on for nearly four months; all the paths of ingress and egress were closed to the garrison. Shivaji found himself in a fatal trap. So, he wrote a secret letter to Jauhar, deceitfully begging his protection and offering to make an alliance with him. In order to negotiate for the terms he asked for a passport. Jauhar, \\"who was both fool and traitor,\\" swallowed the bait; he assured Shivaji of his protection, gave him a safe conduct, and flattered himself that with Shiva for an ally he would be able to create a kingdom of his own in independence of Adil Shah. Next day Shivaji with only two or three followers visited Jauhar at midnight and was received in darbar. After oaths of co-operation had been taken on both sides, Shivaji returned quickly to the fort, and the pretended siege was continued. When the news of Jauhar's treacherous coquetting with Shiva reached the ears of Ali Adil Shah, that king burst into anger and left his capital (5 August) \\"to punish both the rebels.\\" An envoy was sent to bring Jauhar back to the right path, but the mission was a failure. When, however, Ali reached Miraj and his Vanguard advanced beyond it still nearer to Panhala, Shivaji slipped out of the fort one night with his family and 2 to 3 hundred soldiers, and Panhala returned to Adil Shah's possession without a blow (about 25 August 1660.) As the Bijapur Court-poet sang in exultation, \\"Ali took Panhala from Salabat in a twinkle.\\"(Tarikh-i-Ali, 82-93 ; B. S. 353-357 ; F. R. Rajapur, Kolhapur to Sural, dated 5 June. 1660. Chit. 64 ; Dig. 175-176 ; T. S. I8b-19a.) Shivaji's escape from the fort was soon detected, and a strong Bijapuri force under Jauhar's son Siddi Aziz and Afzal Khan's son Fazl Khan set out in pursuit of him. On reaching a narrow ravine (probably near Malkapur), Shiva left 300 men there under Baji Pradhu (the deshpande of Hardis Maval) with orders to hold the mouth of the pass at all costs till the main body of the fugitives had reached Vishalgad. The Bijapuris delivered three bloody assaults on the heroic rear-guard, all of which were beaten off. But when at last the gun-fire from Vishalgarh gave the anxiously expected signal that Shivaji had reached safety within its walls, the gallant Baji Prabhu was lying mortally wounded with 200 of his followers. Baji Prabhu had done his appointed duty. The Bijapuris declined to besiege Vishalgarh, and retired to their own territory, after recovering Pavangarh and some other forts in addition to Panhala. Shivaji retained in that quarter only the forts of Rangana and Vishalgarh.[Chil. 64-65; Dig. 182-185; T. S. 19a & b; the name of Siddi Aziz is given by Duff (i. 181) only, while T, 5. reads Siddi Halal. The Persian works are absolutely silent about this retreat. Vishalgarh is 27 miles from Panhala via Malkapur. (Ind. At. 40 S.

The town has no shops, with the nearest being in Normanville, one kilometre away.  Location  Carrickalinga is in the vicinity of several emerging wineries.  Description  The beaches are wide with white sand that stretches down to the pristine water. Haycock Point, a much-photographed volcanic outcrop, separates North Carrickalinga and South Carrickalinga beaches. Tjilbruke's trail follows the coastline through Carrickalinga.  History  Carrickalinga first appeared in 1958 as the name of a private subdivision developed by a George Lewis of Waterloo Corner in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Myponga. The name was ‚Äúused in preference to Gold Coast‚Äú and is reported as being a ‚Äúcorruption of karikalingga, a former Aboriginal camp on Section 1018, meaning 'place for redgum firewood'.‚Äù Boundaries were established in respect to the Geographical Names Act in 1988 with a portion being added in 1994 and then ‚Äúredefined‚Äù in 1999. George Lewis is remembered in the naming of Lewis Road, whilst a former Town Clerk of the District Council of Yankalilla, Tom Lyddon, has Lyddon Place named after him. The original sales agent, Cliff Hawkins, placed a flagpole on the hill adjoining Solitude Drive, which remains in place today.

The race was called His Majesty's Plate and was valued at ¬£100. The tradition of summer horse racing at Bellewstown dates back centuries. The first record of racing here appears in the August edition of the Dublin Gazette and the Weekly Courier in 1726. There was originally a cricket ground in the middle of the race track. Racing continues to occur on an annual basis, taking place during the course of the summer. There are currently two meetings a year, comprising four days in July and two days in August.

Other kinds of measures are therefore used on infinite-dimensional spaces: often, the abstract Wiener space construction is used. Alternatively, one may consider Lebesgue measure on finite-dimensional subspaces of the larger space and consider so-called prevalent and shy sets. Compact sets in Banach spaces may also carry natural measures: the Hilbert cube, for instance, carries the product Lebesgue measure. In a similar spirit, the compact topological group given by the Tychonoff product of infinitely many copies of the circle group is infinite- dimensional, and carries a Haar measure that is translation-invariant. Motivation It can be shown that Lebesgue measure Œªn on Euclidean space Rn is locally finite, strictly positive and translation-invariant, explicitly: * every point x in Rn has an open neighbourhood Nx with finite measure Œªn(Nx) < +‚àû; * every non-empty open subset U of Rn has positive measure Œªn(U) > 0; and * if A is any Lebesgue-measurable subset of Rn, Th : Rn ‚Üí Rn, Th(x) = x + h, denotes the translation map, and (Th)‚àó(Œªn) denotes the push forward, then (Th)‚àó(Œªn)(A) = Œªn(A). Geometrically speaking, these three properties make Lebesgue measure very nice to work with. When we consider an infinite- dimensional space such as an Lp space or the space of continuous paths in Euclidean space, it would be nice to have a similarly nice measure to work with. Unfortunately, this is not possible. Statement of the theorem Let (X, ¬∑) be an infinite-dimensional, separable Banach space. Then the only locally finite and translation-invariant Borel measure Œº on X is the trivial measure, with Œº(A) = 0 for every measurable set A. Equivalently, every translation-invariant measure that is not identically zero assigns infinite measure to all open subsets of X. Proof of the theorem Let X be an infinite-dimensional, separable Banach space equipped with a locally finite, translation-invariant measure Œº. Using local finiteness, suppose that, for some Œ¥ > 0, the open ball B(Œ¥) of radius Œ¥ has finite Œº-measure. Since X is infinite-dimensional, there is an infinite sequence of pairwise disjoint open balls Bn(Œ¥/4), n ‚àà N, of radius Œ¥/4, with all the smaller balls Bn(Œ¥/4) contained within the larger ball B(Œ¥). By translation-invariance, all of the smaller balls have the same measure; since the sum of these measures is finite, the smaller balls must all have Œº-measure zero. Now, since X is separable, it can be covered by a countable collection of balls of radius Œ¥/4; since each such ball has Œº-measure zero, so must the whole space X, and so Œº is the trivial measure.

It is best known for the limestone arches it carved in the Oparara Basin. The river and most of its tributaries originate in the Fenian Ranges in the Kahurangi National Park, where the river flows through a section of the Honeycomb Hill Cave. Further downstream it continues through the ≈åpƒÅrara Arch and the Moria Gate Arch, both of which are popular walking destinations. These sections of the ≈åpƒÅrara River, while still in dense native forest, can be reached by a forestry road. For the majority of its length it continues to meander south through the ≈åpƒÅrara Basin before turning west to flow into the Tasman Sea near the small settlement of ≈åpƒÅrara north of the township of Karamea. The river's color varies from tea-like shades of golden brown to red from the natural organic tannins released into the water by several of the plant species in the area. Leaves and other plant matter on the forest floor releases these tannins as they decompose - this eventually leeches into and stains the water, with the shade and intensity varying depending on rainfall and season. The river and contributing streams in the area are a habitat for the endangered South Island whio; the area used to sustain a large population of whio and is now a location for a recovery programme run by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

The Wonthaggi railway line started about 2 miles (1.5 km) east of Nyora, having originally being surveyed to be much closer to Loch, see Kernot railway station, so as to follow the Bass River valley, and avoid any steep graidents, This new surveyed light railway route would save costs and no bridge would be built over Berry's Road in Nyora, on Crown Allotment 2035 Parish Of Jeetho West. This significant embankment still stands out to this very day. 5 Years later the line required re-grading, and the Lang Lang Railway Company once again pushed for the construction of a cheaper Coastal Coastal Railway, instead of reducing the gradient of the original route and in particular the very longJunction (rail) which was used to manage the Route capacity coming into the switching station (Nyora). and other grading works along the inland route. The Crown Allotment 2005 in the Parish Of Jeetho West of the Branch line now having far too high a Grade (slope) Woodleigh is located in the Bass Coast Shire, Victoria, and was almost the second station on the line, when settlers asked for a closer station nearer to Nyora and Crown Allotment 2004 in the Parish Of Jeetho West, (where the line crosses the South Gippsland Highway on the North Side at ), was put aside for this purpose.

It is a nitrogen mustard Œ≤-chloro-nitrosourea compound used as an alkylating agent. Description Carmustine is an orange- yellow solid medication used mainly for chemotherapy. It is a nitrogen mustard Œ≤-chloro-nitrosourea compound. Mechanism of action As an alkylating agent, carmustine can form interstrand crosslinks in DNA, which prevents DNA replication and DNA transcription. Uses Carmustine is used as an alkylating agent to treat several types of brain cancer including glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma and astrocytoma), multiple myeloma, and lymphoma (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin). BCNU is sometimes used in conjunction with alkyl guanine transferase (AGT) inhibitors, such as O6-benzylguanine. The AGT-inhibitors increase the efficacy of carmustine by inhibiting the direct reversal pathway of DNA repair, which will prevent formation of the interstrand crosslink between the N1 of guanine and the N3 of cytosine. It is also used as part of a chemotherapeutic protocol in preparation for hematological stem cell transplantation, a type of bone marrow transplant, in order to reduce the white blood cell count in the recipient. Use under this protocol, usually with fludarabine and melphalan, was developed by oncologists at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Implants In the treatment of brain tumours, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved biodegradable discs infused with carmustine (Gliadel). They are implanted under the skull during a surgery called a craniotomy. The disc allows for controlled release of carmustine in the extracellular fluid of the brain, thus eliminating the need for the encapsulated drug to cross the blood-brain barrier. Production Carmustine for injection was marketed under the name BiCNU by Bristol-Myers Squibb and now by Emcure Pharmaceuticals. In India it is sold under various brand names, including Consium..

It argues that the German youth are especially dangerous because they had spent their entire lives under the Nazi regime. The policy of non-fraternisationwhere US soldiers were forbidden to speak even to small childrenwas first announced to the soldiers in the film: The basic theme that the German people could not be trusted derived from the peace policy that emerged from the Second Quebec Conference.

This was simply not enough for the Victorian Railways, who further demanded \\"land loading\\" be applied should the proposed line prove to be unprofitable.

The owner of the tramway even proposed, that at his own cost he would extend his tramway from his current workings at Kilcunda all the way to Cape Patterson, if the proposed Railway were built. Prompting further exploration of the extent of the coalfields along the coast, and ending in a proposal to extend the line onto the Powlett River Coalfields, with construction beginning in earnest.

It recorded its first serious accident shortly after opening when a goods train from Nyora, dashed into a coal train waiting in the siding, derailing and severely damaging both engines, with both trains crews escaping injury. and workmen working throughout the night and into the next day to unblock the road and clear the line. The land on which, having previously been surveyed and acquired, without objection, under the \\"Railways Lands Acquisition Act 1893\\" by authority of the Nyora and Woolamai Railway Construction Act (1907). on the proviso that this railway line be run inland from Nyora, and not along the coast from Lang Lang. Later many of the proponents of this inland railway, felt somewhat deceived when the actual 'surveyed route' acquired so much of their fertile land, (up to 50 yards on either side of the line), and did not pass within a mile of the Almurta township. due to the gradients of the land. With petitions to Parlament, and requests to the shire engineer to independently survey the route, and take it through the cheaper hills where the land was only worth ¬£5 per acre, rather than the flat lands worth up to ¬£40 per acre. The use of these flat lands greatly contributed to the retention of the line, 5 years after its opening, see Woodleigh railway station The station was originally called \\"Almurta\\" (Victorian Railways Schedule 1639/10 in Feb 1910) servicing the coal line, but was temporarily renamed \\"McKenzie\\" (Victorian Railways Schedule 2204/10 May 1910) when it opened for passenger and goods services on the Wonthaggi railway line on the 9th May 1910. As expected on the inland route, Passengers Services only lasted a few years, losing ¬£900 per year, due to poor patronage. \\"McKenzie\\" being the surname of an officer of the mines department, had been prominently identified with the opening of the Powlett Coalfield. The station was finally renamed \\"Kernot\\" by the Railway commissioners, as the original Kernot station had been named after the Chief Engineer of the Victorian Railways and by preserving of this surname in 1911, (after much discussion in parliament), and also in honour of his recently deceased brother Professor William Charles Kernot (1845 -1909) The original \\"Kernot\\" station was controversially renamed \\"Glen Forbes\\" by Victorian Government which Gazetted this, and made it public in local newspapers like \\"The Argus\\" Mon 27 Feb 1911 Page 10 The explanation supplied by the Railway Commissioners published in newspaper like \\"The Herald\\" Sat 14 May 1910 Page 5, stated that the original \\"Rees\\" and \\"Kernot\\" stations, were renamed to avoid confusion, as \\"Almurta\\" was already a little postal settlement two miles east of the railway line, and \\"Glen Forbes\\" was another postal settlement three miles east of the line.

He moved frequently in his club career, representing teams in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Greece, Romania, the Netherlands, the United States, Norway and Malta. Internationally, Fernandes played for Canada at under-20 level before switching allegiance to Portugal, and was called up for their senior team at the 2010 World Cup. Early life The son of a Portuguese father and a Czechoslovakian mother, Fernandes was born in Edmonton, Alberta, being raised in East Vancouver, British Columbia. His first club was the Vancouver Olympics. Club career =Early days= In 2000, aged 17, Fernandes returned to the land of his father and joined FC Porto's youth system. In his first two years as a senior he only managed to appear for the reserves, his second team being Celta de Vigo B in Spain. In January 2003, the Galicians loaned Fernandes to Regionalliga S√ºd side SSV Jahn Regensburg, but again failed to appear officially for the main squad, returning in June to Celta and being released from contract. =PAOK= After a successful trial, Fernandes signed with PAOK FC, totalling four Super League Greece games in his first two seasons. In 2005, the team's general manager ‚Äì and former player ‚Äì Giorgos Kostikos took over after coach Nikos Karageorgiou was dismissed following a bad string of results. He immediately replaced ageing Kyriakos Tohouroglou in his starting XI with the Portuguese. Despite many problems both inside and outside the pitch, PAOK managed to finish in sixth place in the 2005‚Äì06 campaign, with Fernandes making 27 appearances as the Thessaloniki club qualified to the UEFA Cup, only to be disqualified shortly after for irregularities. He remained first choice for the remainder of his spell. =Bochum= On 23 May 2008, after extensive negotiations, PAOK accepted an offer from VfL Bochum, who signed Fernandes for a fee of approximately ‚Ç¨1.2 million, with the player reuniting at the German side with former teammate Marcin Miƒôciel. Fernandes made his Bundesliga debut on 16 August 2008, in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Karlsruher SC. He only missed three league matches in his first season, as the North Rhine-Westphalia team retained their top- division status after finishing 14th. In 2009‚Äì10, Fernandes was relegated to the bench by Philipp Heerwagen and, on 18 January 2010, he was loaned to Iraklis Thessaloniki F.C. until the end of the campaign. In the summer, he signed on loan with another Greek side, Panathinaikos FC, who retained an option to buy. Fernandes moved to Panserraikos F.C. in January 2011, again on loan. He appeared sparingly as the team were relegated from the top level, and was released by Bochum in June. =Cluj and Twente= On 16 August 2011, Fernandes joined Romania's CFR Cluj. He was released after five months, in which he played just two games. Fernandes moved teams and countries again on 17 January 2012, signing a two-year contract with FC Twente in the Eredivisie and competing with Nikolay Mihaylov for the no.1 position. He spent the following seasons on loan, with OFI Crete FC and Panthrakikos FC. =North America= On 3 August 2015, Fernandes moved to the San Antonio Scorpions on loan from Twente. After the former ceased operations following the 2015 NASL season, he joined manager Alen Marcina as both signed with Rayo OKC on 2 February 2016. =Return to Europe= For the second consecutive time, Fernandes' American club folded, and he signed for Norwegian Eliteserien team Lillestr√∏m SK on a one-year deal in January 2017. In May he failed a doping test when he tested positive for dextroamphetamine, and was frozen out of the squad while his representatives appealed on the basis that the drug was prescribed medicine for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and worthy of a medical exemption. On 1 July 2018, the 34-year-old Fernandes returned to Portuguese club football for the first time in 16 years, joining S.C. Farense for their upcoming season back in LigaPro. He made his debut for the Algarveans ‚Äì his first professional appearance in the country ‚Äì on 11 August, in a 1‚Äì0 home win over F.C. Famalic√£o. Fernandes' side achieved promotion to the Primeira Liga at the end of the following campaign, but he played no league matches in the process. In August 2020, he signed a one-year contract with Tarxien Rainbows F.C. of the Maltese Premier League. International career Fernandes won caps for Canada at under-20 level. He then changed to play for the country of his father, Portugal, and made his under-21 debut in 2006. Fernandes received his first senior call-up in November 2006, as third goalkeeper behind Ricardo and Quim. In May of the following year, he was selected for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier against Belgium and a friendly with Kuwait, making his debut in the latter after replacing Quim in the 66th minute of a 1‚Äì1 draw. In February 2009, Fernandes played his second international match, substituting Eduardo at the hour-mark of a 1‚Äì0 win against Finland. In May 2010 he was named in the 23-man squad for that year's FIFA World Cup, but did not play in the tournament in South Africa.

Appearance and behavior Corriedale have a long life span, and are hardy and evenly balanced all over the body. Corriedales are docile, easy care mothers, with high fertility. They adapt well to a wide range of climate conditions. They are large framed and plain bodied, polled (hornless) and have a broad body. Corriedales produce a thick stapled, bulky fleece, which is popular with spinners and can be used for a range of handspun garments. Their dense fleece is medium-fine and high yielding, with good length and softness, somewhat between medium wool and long wool.

Corriedale Assoc. Corriedale.org.au, Retrieved on 23 May 2009 The goal was to develop a breed that would thrive in lower rainfall areas and supply long-staple wool. James Little was the original breeder. The name comes from a property in the South Island, where he conducted his work under the encouragement of NZALC superindent, William Soltau Davidson. The breed was developed between 1868 and 1910. As a dual purpose breed of sheep (good for meat and wool), the Corriedale breed was gradually distributed to many of the sheep-raising areas in the world. For example, the first Corriedales were imported to the United States in 1914. The Corriedale was later used as one of the parents of the U.S.-developed Targhee breed.

Raltitrexed is fully active after polyglutamylation, which allows cellular retention of the drug. By inhibiting Thymidylate synthase (TS), thus formation of precursor pyrimidine nucleotides, raltitrexed prevents the formation of DNA and RNA, which are required for the growth and survival of both normal cells and cancer cells. Inhibition of L1210 cell growth in culture IC50 = 9 nM, is one of the strongest antimetabolites in use. Structure and phase I clinical trial of the precursor drug, CB3717, was described in 1986.

The person who originally recommended this path to him was his mentor, Professor Nambara Shigeru, who was highly critical of military and bureaucratic obstructions to the growth of a constitutionally defined 'national community'.Barshay, op. cit. pp. 104‚Äì108 An expert in European political thought, Nambara steered the young Maruyama into working on these topics. In March 1945, Maruyama was drafted and stationed in the Army at Hiroshima. After experiencing the atomic blast at Hiroshima and seeing out the end of the war there, he returned to his post at the university in September. He caught tuberculosis at the time, and after an operation, spent the rest of his life on one lung. Rise to fame Maruyama first attracted attention from the scholarly community immediately following the war with his famous essay on wartime Japanese fascism, \\"The Logic and Psychology of Ultranationalism,\\" first published in the widely-read journal Sekai in 1946. In particular, Maruyama deemed the prewar imperial system a \\"system of irresponsibility.\\" Maruyama continued to write about wartime and contemporary Japanese politics in the late 1940s and early 1950s, until he was forced to take a break from scholarly activities due to his being in and out of hospitals with illnesses in the mid-1950s. He returned to his research in the late 1950s, but ceased writing about recent politics and focused his attention on excavating the political thought of the Edo and Meiji periods. It was not until the late 1950s that Maruyama's earlier essays were anthologized and republished for the first time, bringing him fame and acclaim from a much broader cross-section of the Japanese general public. Role in protest movements Maruyama became involved in the Anpo Protests against revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty at an early stage, in 1959, and became involved in a variety of protest activities and publishing anti-treaty statements. Shortly after the shocking ramming of the Treaty through the Diet by Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi on May 19, 1960, Maruyama emerged as one of the main faces of the anti-Treaty movement. On May 24, he gave a dramatic speech ‚ÄúTime for a Choice‚Äù (Sentaku no toki) to an over-capacity crowd at a hall in central Tokyo. Maruyama argued that Japan was about to choose between democracy and dictatorship. He also argued that due to Kishi's outrageous actions, ordinary Japanese people needed to support the anti-Treaty protests in order to protect democracy, even if they did not mind the Treaty itself. However, Maruyama later came to regret his starring role in the 1960 crisis. In the aftermath of the protests, Maruyama was attacked by opponents on both the right and the left. From the right, he was attacked as a supporter of communists and socialists, and from the left, he was accused of being a supporter of a very narrow vision of \\"bourgeois\\" democracy that only supported the interest of the ruling capitalist classes. Maruyama was most strongly attacked by fellow leftist intellectual Yoshimoto Takaaki, who had a large following among New Left student radicals. During the university protests in the late 1960s Maruyama was strongly denounced by the students front as a symbol of \\"self-deceiving\\" postwar democracy. Maruyama in turn criticized this new student movement, especially after he was subjected to intense harassment and his personal office at the University of Tokyo was ransacked by occupying students in 1969. Around this time, Maruyama angrily confronted the students, Maruyama telling them, \\"Even the fascists didn't do what you are trying to do!\\" This kind of episode, combined with his own ailing health, forced him to retire in 1971. He was however appointed professor emeritus at the same university in 1974. Later life Though Maruyama suffered from poor health especially in his later life, he continued studying and writing until he died in Tokyo on 15 August 1996. The major work of his retirement years was a three-volume commentary on Fukuzawa Yukichi's principal work Bunmeiron no Gairyaku, based on a lengthy seminar he conducted with a small working group. This was published in 1986, as Reading 'An Outline of a Theory of Civilisation', („ÄåÊñáÊòéË´ñ‰πãÊ¶ÇÁï•„Äç„ÇíË™≠„ÇÄ) by Iwanami Shoten. Besides, he contributed several more noteworthy as well as controversial works on Japanese culture or the process of translation in modern Japan. Most noteworthy is his concept of basso ostinato. Maruyama referred to this musicological concept to capture a socio- historically substratum underlying human thought. Although basso ostinato is in constant flux, it is experienced by people as a relatively stable intellectual framework through which people give meaning to life.

It is also used in medicine as an antineoplastic (anti-cancer) agent developed by Ligand Pharmaceuticals. It is a first generation retinoid. Ligand gained Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for alitretinoin in February 1999. Medical uses =Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma= In the United States, topical alitretinoin is indicated for the treatment of skin lesions in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Alitretinoin is not indicated when systemic therapy against Kaposi's sarcoma is required. It has received EMA (11 October 2000) and FDA (2 March 1999) approval for this indication. =Chronic hand eczema= Alitretinoin has been granted prescription rights in the UK (08/09/2008) for in chronic hand eczema as used by mouth. In May 2009 the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued preliminary guidance on the use of alitretinoin for the treatment of severe chronic hand eczema in adults. The recommendation stated that only patients with severe chronic hand eczema who are unresponsive to potent topical corticosteroids, oral immunosuppressants or phototherapy should receive the drug. Final NICE guidance is expected in August 2009. Adverse effects =Systemic use= Very common (>10% frequency): * Headache * Hypertriglyceridemia * High density lipoprotein decreased * Hypercholesterolemia Common (1-10% frequency): * Anaemia * Increased iron binding capacity * Monocytes decreased * Thrombocytes increased * TSH decreased * Free T4 decreased * Flushing * Conjunctivitis * Dry eye * Eye irritation * Transaminase increased * Dry skin * Dry lips * Cheilitis * Eczema * Dermatitis * Erythema * Hair loss * Joint pain * Muscle pains * Blood creatine phosphokinase increased Uncommon (0.1-1% frequency): * Blurred vision * Cataracts * Nose bleeds * Itchiness * Rash * Skin exfoliation * Asteatotic eczema * Exostosis * Ankylosing spondylitis Rare (<0.1% frequency): * Benign intracranial hypertension * Vasculitis Unknown frequency: * Anaphylactic reactions * Hypersensitivity * Depression * Mood changes * Suicidal ideation * Decreased night vision =Topical use= Very common (>10% frequency): * Rash (77%) * Pain (34%) * Itchiness (11%) Common (1-10% frequency): * Exfoliative dermatitis * Oedema * Skin changes * Paraesthesia =Contraindications= Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication as with most other vitamin A products, it should also be avoided when it comes to systemic use in any women that is of childbearing potential and not taking precautions to prevent pregnancy. Toctino (the oral capsule formulation of alitretinoin) contains soya oil and sorbitol. Patients who are allergic to peanut, soya or with rare hereditary fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. It is also contraindicated in nursing mothers. The oral formulation of alitretinoin is contraindicated in patients with: * Hepatic insufficiency * Severe chronic kidney disease * Uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia * Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia * Uncontrolled hypothyroidism * Hypervitaminosis A * Hypersensitivity to any excipients in alitretinoin = Interactions = It is a CYP3A4 substrate and hence any inhibitor or inducer of this enzyme may alter plasma levels of alitretinoin. It should not be given to patients with excess vitamin A in their system as there is a potential for its actions on the retinoid X receptor to be exacerbated. It may also interact with tetracyclines to cause benign intracranial hypertension. =Overdose= Alitretinoin is a form of vitamin A. Alitretinoin has been administered in oncological clinical studies at dosages of more than 10-times of the therapeutic dosage given for chronic hand eczema. The adverse effects observed were consistent with retinoid toxicity, and included severe headache, diarrhoea, facial flushing and hypertriglyceridemia. These effects were reversible. Mechanism of action Alitretinoin is believed to be the endogenous ligand (a substance that naturally occurs in the body that activates this receptor) for retinoid X receptor, but it also activates the retinoic acid receptor.

Often it is used together with anthracycline, vincristine, and prednisone. It is used by injection. Common side effects include allergic reactions, blood clotting problems, high blood sugar, liver problems, pancreas inflammation, and blood clots in the brain. Its use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a modified version of the enzyme asparaginase which has undergone PEGylation. It works by breaking down asparagine, decreasing its availability to make protein. Pegaspargase was approved for medical use in the United States in 1994.

It is a third-generation retinoid. Medical uses Bexarotene is indicated for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in people who are refractory to at least one prior systemic therapy (oral) and for the topical treatment of cutaneous lesions in patients with CTCL who have refractory or persistent disease after other therapies or who have not tolerated other therapies (topical). It has been used off-label for non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Contraindications Known contraindications include: * Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients in the preparation(s). * Pregnancy and lactation * Women of child-bearing potential without effective birth-control measures * History of pancreatitis * Uncontrolled hypercholesterolaemia * Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridaemia * Hypervitaminosis A * Uncontrolled thyroid disease * Hepatic insufficiency * Ongoing systemic infection Adverse effects Overall the most common adverse effects are skin reactions (mostly itchiness and rashes), leucopenia, headache, weakness, thyroid anomalies (which seem to be mediated by RXR-mediated downregulation of thyroid stimulating hormone) and blood lipid anomalies such as hypercholesterolaemia (high blood cholesterol) and hyperlipidaemia, hypothyroidism.  Interactions  Its plasma concentration may be increased by concomitant treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole. It may also induce CYP3A4, and hence CYP3A4 substrates like cyclophosphamide may have their plasma concentrations reduced. Likewise consumption of grapefruit juice might increase bexarotene's plasma concentrations, hence potentially altering its therapeutic effects. Mechanism Bexarotene is a retinoid that selectively activates retinoid X receptors (RXRs), as opposed to the retinoic acid receptors, the other major target of retinoic acid (the acid form of vitamin A). By so doing it induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and prevents the development of drug resistance. It also has anti-angiogenic effects and inhibits cancer metastasis. The retinoic acid receptors (RARs) regulate cell differentiation and proliferation whereas RXRs regulate apoptosis. Physical properties Bexarotene is a solid, white powder. It is poorly soluble in water; the solubility is estimated to be about 10-50 ŒºM. It is soluble in DMSO at 65 mg/mL and in ethanol at 10 mg/mL with warming. History SRI International and the La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation (now the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute) collaborated on work that resulted in patent filings for the drug. The developer of bexarotene (brand name Targretin) was Ligand Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego biotech company which received FDA approval for the drug in 1999. The FDA approved bexarotene on 29 December 1999. Japanese pharmaceutical Eisai bought the rights to Targretin and three other anti-cancer products from Ligand in 2006. In the United States, patents on the drug expired in 2016. It received EMA approval on 29 March 2001. Early-stage preclinical studies suggested that bexarotene reduced amyloid plaques and improved mental functioning in a small sample of mice engineered to exhibit Alzheimer's-like symptoms although subsequent studies have yielded mixed results. The results of CCMR-One, a clinical trial of the effects of bexarotene on patients with multiple sclerosis operated by the University of Cambridge, have shown that the drug can cause remyelination, but will not lead to the drug being used as a therapy, due to its risk profile.

Favoring representational art, Hicks painted landscapes and still lifes and the occasional portrait, using small brushes and a magnifying glass to achieve a high level of detail in paintings that were often just 2 to 4 inches wide. Hicks often lectured on Miniature Art and was President of the Miniature Painters, Sculptors and Gravers Society of Washington from 1983 to 1988. In 1993 she published a miniature book on the topic -- measuring just 2 7/8 by 2 5/8 inches -- called Art in Miniature. As a collector of miniature books, Hicks \\"felt it would make a lot of sense\\" to do a miniature book on art in miniature. The book covers small-scale painting, sculpture, and engraving. All proceeds from the book went to a scholarship program for Washington DC high school students planning to study art. Hicks' paintings and other artwork were exhibited in Washington and Baltimore, London, Japan, and at the U.S. Embassy in Gambia. Several of her pieces were among the more than 500 works in an international exhibition of miniature art she helped organize at the Smithsonian Institution's S. Dillon Ripley Center in 2004. Margaret Turner Hicks was born in Philadelphia. She graduated from Temple University and went on to study art in Germany while her husband (now-retired Army Col. Stanford R. Hicks) was posted overseas. She also taught elementary school and tutored soldiers before becoming a full-time artist in 1968, a year after the couple settled in Washington, DC. Hicks was an active leader in her community: President of The American Art League in Washington, member of the Arts club of Washington, Arts for Aging, The Miniature Art Society of Washington and other arts and civic groups. In addition to miniature art, she also made jewelry and clothing; her sweaters were known to be especially elaborate. She died of cancer on August 3, 2006. > \\"There is something fascinating about the exquisite art of miniature > painting.

Debby formed just off the coast of Africa on August 21 from a tropical wave. After passing near the Cape Verde islands, Debby moved generally northwestward for much of its life, reaching a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). Strong wind shear weakened the storm, and Debby dissipated on August 27 over the northern Atlantic Ocean. Early in its life, Debby was forecast to pass through the southern Cape Verde islands as a tropical storm, potentially causing life-threatening flooding. Most computer models consistently predicted Debby to track to the northwest throughout its lifetime, though intensity was more problematic for forecasters. The National Hurricane Center continually predicted Debby to intensify to hurricane status, though strong vertical shear ultimately prevented the storm from becoming a hurricane. Meteorological history A vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa late on August 20, and almost immediately developed convective banding and a broad circulation. A broad area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day while located 260 mi (420 km) southeast of the Cape Verde islands. Though convection decreased early on August 21, the area of low pressure remained well-organized and the system developed into Tropical Depression Four late on August 21. Water temperatures remained warm enough for development, while upper-level shear was minimal as the depression moved west- northwestward due to a ridge of high pressure to its north. Initial predictions by the National Hurricane Center also forecast a motion to the northwest based on consistent model predictions, though, as quoted by forecaster James Franklin, \\"The models have also been excellently wrong thus far\\". Despite a decrease in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained well organized, with a wind field 575 mi (930 km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140 mi (225 km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300 mi (485 km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm in an area of warm water temperatures and moderate upper-level shear. Pre-Debby disturbance southeast of the Cape Verde islands on August 21 Shortly after reaching its peak intensity, Debby encountered an area of dry air, and subsequently weakened. The low level circulation detached itself from the diminishing convection while the system as a whole continued west-northwestward. Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center, while banding features redeveloped as well. Organization continued, and Debby again reached its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) on August 24. Southerly wind shear displaced the convection to the north of the center, and Debby weakened to a minimal tropical storm on August 25. The center of the storm became asymmetric and elongated, and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression. Convection remained minimal and it quickly degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure. The low turned to the north and north-northeast ahead of an approaching trough, and on August 28 the low dissipated. Preparation and Impact The government of the Cape Verde islands issued a tropical storm warning coinciding with the issuance of the first advisory on Tropical Depression Four, meaning tropical storm conditions were expected in the area within 24 hours. The National Hurricane Center stated that heavy rainfall, potentially as high as 10 in (250 mm) in mountainous areas, would be possible in the territory, possibly causing life- threatening flash floods and mudslides. However, due to a reformation further to the south, tropical storm warnings were discontinued as the depression moved from the area. While passing around 115 mi (185 km) to the southwest of the southwesternmost islands, the depression produced a 35 mph (55 km/h) wind gust at Fogo and some rainfall, though no damage was reported. Long range forecasts brought the storm near Bermuda. However Debby remained over 900 mi (1,450 km) from the island at its closest approach. Though the storm was forecast to remain far away from the Gulf of Mexico, investors tracking the storm caused the price of crude oil to rise 60 cents a barrel due to the potential impact to oil installations.

Sword of Honour Men at Arms is the first novel in Waugh's Sword of Honour series, the author's look at the Second World War. The novels loosely parallel Waugh's wartime experiences. Plot summary The protagonist is Guy Crouchback, heir of a declining aristocratic English Roman Catholic family. Guy has spent his thirties at the family villa in Italy shunning the world after the failure of his marriage and has decided to return to England at the very beginning of the Second World War, in the belief that the creeping evils of modernity, gradually apparent in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, have become all too clearly displayed as a real and embodied enemy. He attempts to join the Army, finally succeeding with the (fictitious) Royal Corps of Halberdiers, an old but not too fashionable regiment. He trains as an officer and is posted to various centres around Britain. One of the themes is recurring \\"flaps\\" or chaos -- embarking and disembarking from ships and railway carriages that go nowhere. Crouchback meets Brigadier Ben Ritchie-Hook, a fire eater (probably based on Lieutenant General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, a college friend of Waugh's father-in-law whom Waugh knew somewhat from his club) and Apthorpe, a very eccentric fellow officer; in an episode of high farce, the two have a battle of wits and military discipline over an Edwardian thunder-box (portable toilet) which Crouchback observes, amused and detached. Before being sent on active service, he attempts to seduce Virginia, secure in the knowledge that the Catholic Church still regards her as his wife; she refuses him. He and Ben Ritchie-Hook share an adventure during the Dakar Expedition in 1940. Apthorpe dies in Freetown, supposedly of a tropical disease; when it is discovered that Guy gave him a bottle of whisky when visiting him in hospital (there is an implication that Apthorpe's disease, unknown to Guy, was really alcoholic liver failure), Guy is sent home, having blotted his copybook. Awards Waugh received the 1952 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Men at Arms.  Dramatisations  Men At Arms was dramatised for television in 2001 along with the two other novels in the Sword of Honour trilogy, featuring Daniel Craig.

Eduljee, \\"Parsi Influence Surat\\", Zoroastrian Heritage. and as he himself tells, earned his own bread from the age of fifteen, traveling widely as a commercial agent in India. By the time of his appointment, he was already experienced, self- reliant and resourceful, and his choice by the Society proved a wholly admirable one. He is remembered among the Zoroastrians of Iran, for whom he was to labor, with only one brief intermission from then until his death in 1890.\\"Maneckji Limji Hataria in Iran\\", English Zoroastrian Library, reprinted from K. R. Cama Oriental Institute Golden Jubilee Volume, Bombay, 1969. Activities in Iran In 1854 Hataria was appointed emissary by the \\"Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund\\", an organization founded in Bombay by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit with the aim of improving the conditions for the less fortunate co-religionists in Iran, who were being persecuted by the Qajar rulers. In Yazd, Hataria established a Council of Zoroastrians, which succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are today known as Iranis). Hataria may also have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya poll tax for his co-religionists in 1882. Manekji preached the advantages of collective social work and communal unity. He urged the Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kerman to form anjuman societies, based somewhat on the pattern of the Bombay Parsi Panchayet. Reports of early activities, sent by Manekji to Bombay, show that amongst other matters, the Kerman society attended to the restoration of the fire temple there. Similarly, hearing of the efforts of Manekji, the Bombay Parsis (led by Sir Dinshaw Petit, whose wife Sakarbai was from her mother's side of Iranian ancestry) collected funds for the repair of the Yazd Atash Behram (not the same as the present one, which dates to 1932).

The blast occurred at a munitions factory that was manufacturing explosives for Britain's First World War military effort. Approximately of trinitrotoluene (TNT) exploded, killing 73 people and injuring 400 more, as well as causing substantial damage in the local area. This was not the first, last, largest, or the most deadly explosion at a munitions facility in Britain during the war: an explosion at Faversham involving of TNT killed 105 in 1916, and the National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell, exploded in 1918, killing 137. Operations The factory was built in 1893 on the south side (River Thames side) of North Woolwich Road (now the A1020, nearly opposite Mill Road) by Brunner Mond, a forerunner of Imperial Chemical Industries, to produce soda crystals and caustic soda. Production of caustic soda ceased in 1912, which left part of the factory idle. Two years into the war, the Army was facing a crippling shell shortage. The War Office decided to use the factory's surplus capacity to purify TNT, a process more dangerous than manufacture itself, although the factory was in a highly populated area. Despite opposition from Brunner Mond, production of TNT began in September 1915. The method used was invented by Brunner Mond's chief scientist F. A. Freeth, who believed the process to be \\"manifestly very dangerous\\". The plant continued to purify TNT at a rate of approximately per day until it was destroyed by the explosion. Another plant, at Gadbrook, was built in 1916 and was producing TNT at a higher rate than the Silvertown factory, away from populated areas, with more stringent safety standards. Both factories were in full production. Explosion On 19 January, a fire broke out in the melt-pot room, and efforts to put it out were under way when approximately of TNT ignited at 6:52 pm. The TNT plant was destroyed instantly, as were many nearby buildings, including the Silvertown Fire Station. Much of the TNT was in railway goods wagons awaiting transport. Debris was strewn for miles around, with red-hot chunks of rubble causing fires. A gasometer gasholder was damaged on Greenwich Peninsula, creating a fireball from of gas; the holder was later repaired and remained until 1986. Several thousand pounds' worth of goods were also destroyed in nearby warehouses, estimated by the Port of London Authority to span . The chancel and church hall of the local church, St Barnabas', were destroyed, only to be replaced in 1926. Seventy-three people were killed (sixty-nine immediately, and four later from their injuries), and more than 400 injured. Up to 70,000 properties were damaged, 900 nearby ones destroyed or unsalvageably damaged; the cost was put at either ¬£250,000 or ¬£2.5 million. The comparatively low death toll for such a large blast was due to the time of day. The factories were largely empty of workers (there were fewer than forty in the TNT factory itself), but it was too early for the upper floors of houses (which sustained the worst of the flying debris damage) to be heavily populated. Also, it occurred on a Friday, when fewer people were around the factory. However, several professional firemen and volunteers fighting the earlier fire were killed or seriously injured in the explosion. For comparison, of TNT exploded at the National Shell Filling Factory, and killed 137 people; an explosion at Split Rock, New York, in 1918 killed 50‚Äì52 people with of TNT. Reportedly, the explosion also blew the glass out of windows in the Savoy Hotel and almost overturned a taxi in Pall Mall, London, the fires could be seen in Maidstone and Guildford, and the blast was heard up to away, including at Sandringham in Norfolk and along the Sussex coast. Although the blast was heard at a great distance, it was not heard uniformly across the whole intermediate distance, owing to atmospheric effects caused by refraction of the sound waves. Response The emergency services immediately became involved in putting out the fires caused by the explosion, treating the wounded, and beginning to repair the damage caused. First-aid stations were set up in the streets to treat minor injuries. A Salvation Army rescue team was sent into the area under Catherine Bramwell-Booth, and the YMCA also rendered aid, including food and hot drinks. Thousands were left homeless, requiring temporary accommodation in schools, churches, and other similar places. 1,700 men were employed in the reconstruction task by February. ¬£3m in aid was paid to those affected by the blast, equivalent to approximately ¬£40m in 2007, of which ¬£1m was paid to local businesses and factories, including ¬£185,000 to Brunner-Mond. The clear-up was under the direction of Sir Frank Baines, and a report in the Manchester Guardian of 12 February 1917 stated 750 to 1000 men were on site. Six hundred houses had been demolished by the explosion and 400 new ones were being built. Three hundred others had been repaired and many more re-slated. Henry Cavendish-Bentinck and Alfred Mond, son of the eponymous Ludwig Mond of Brunner-Mond, debated in Parliament the living conditions of residents during the reconstruction; conditions were said to be \\"gravely prejudicial to the public health\\" and \\"not fit for human habitation\\". It was mooted that the residents should be relocated to a newly built garden city, rather than spending ¬£1.3 M rebuilding the present, dilapidated, area. John Joseph Jones, MP for Silvertown also maintained an interest in the disaster. PC Greenoff's memorial plaque in Postman's Park The Ministry of Munitions announced the explosion in the following day's newspaper, and ordered an investigation led by Sir Ernley Blackwell, published on 24 February 1917. A definite single cause of the explosion was not determined, invalidating early theories such as German sabotage or an air- raid, but it was found that the factory's site was inappropriate for the manufacture of TNT. Management and safety practices at the plant were also criticised: TNT was stored in unsafe containers, close to the plant and the risky production process. The report was not disclosed to the public until the 1950s. Other newspapers, including the New York Times, also reported the explosion. On 20 June 1917, Andrea Angel, the plant's chief chemist, who was attending to the initial fire, was posthumously awarded the Edward Medal (First Class) as was George Wenbourne. Police Constable Edward George Brown Greenoff was posthumously awarded the King's Police Medal, and is commemorated with a plaque on the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice in Postman's Park, in central London. The Silvertown explosion was not the final British munitions plant disaster of the First World War. The National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell, in Nottingham, exploded on 1 July 1918, killing 137 and injuring 250.

Scullery maid Ruby Finch had left her employer, the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, to work in a munitions factory for the war effort. The explosion is not only heard at the home of her former employer in Belgravia, but it literally rocks the house. The residents can see a great fire in the distance, \\"down the river somewhere\\". Ruby makes her way back to the house and relates her account of being in the factory when the explosion occurred. She is in deep shock and her face is covered in a sulphurous yellow residue. In Pat Mills's comic-strip, Charley's War, the hero, Charley Bourne, is wounded on the Somme and returns home to Silvertown to be confronted by the aftermath of the explosion. Several subsequent strips depict a Zeppelin raid on the munitions factories in the area and deal with the residents' fears of a repeat of the disaster. In the Charlie Higson Young Bond novel Double or Die, Brunner Mond is one of the cryptic clues and reference is made to the explosion.

It is a small shrub with attractive, pink, star-shaped flowers and is commonly cultivated. Description Crowea saligna is a small shrub usually growing to a height of about with conspicuously angled branches. The leaves are , wide and are narrow elliptic to lance-shaped. They are also dark green, shiny, dotted with oil glands and there is a distinct mid-vein. The flowers develop in the axils of leaves on a stalk 5-13 millimetres (<1/2 inch) long. There are 5 short, broad sepals and 5 overlapping petals forming a \\"star\\" shape. The petals are pink, sometimes white and are 12-18 millimetres (1/2-1 inch) long. The stamens are hairy and enclose the centre of the flower. The flowers appear from January to June and the fruits that follow are dry and have 5 compartments which open to release 2 seeds each. Taxonomy and naming Crowea saligna was first formally described in 1800 by Henry Cranke Andrews. The description was published in The Botanist's Repository for New, and Rare Plants. The specific epithet (saligna) is a Latin word meaning \\" of willow\\". Distribution and habitat Willow-leaved crowea occurs in Sydney between Woy Woy and Yerrinbool and on the adjacent Blue Mountains. It grows in sheltered locations on sandstone. Use in horticulture Crowea saligna is widely cultivated due to its attractive flowers that appear when most other species are dormant. It prefers a well-drained position in sun or semi shade. It grows best in moist soils but will tolerate extended dry periods once established.

Other sources give her year of birth as 1842. ‚Äì 20 January 1902) was a French-born child prodigy violinist, who became an American musician, \\"recognized as one of the finest violinists of the latter half of the 19th century.\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica online. Early life Born √âmilie-Camille Urso in Nantes, France, she was the first daughter of an Italian flutist (Salvator Urso) and a French singer (√âmilie G√©rouard). The first of five children, Camilla's birthdate is still being disputed by historians, some claiming the year of her birth to be 1840, and others claiming it to be 1842. The family lived with her mother's sister, Caroline. Not much is known about Camilla's childhood, but most research shows that her interest in the violin began when ‚Äúshe heard a violin solo played during the Mass for St. Cecilia‚Äù during mass at her father's church, and begged to take the instrument up. When she was six years old, despite general skepticism about her ability to master a ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù instrument, she began taking violin lessons. Camilla's parents made a deal with concertmaster of the theater orchestra, F√©lix Simon, where he would teach Camilla without pay, and within a year's time, they would decide if Camilla would continue her studies or not. She started out studying for three hours a day, and eventually, that time was increased to seven hours a day. She made her debut a year after studying, at a benefit concert for the family of a recently deceased bassoon player in her father's orchestra. She played a piece by the name of de Beriot's Seventh Air Varie, which according to sources, ‚Äúshe learned at the rate of one page per week, and which she had to repeat forty-seven times at one lesson before her teacher would allow her to leave.‚Äù Paris Conservatory Camilla studied at the Paris Conservatory for three years, admitted in June 1849, and passing her final exam in July 1852. She was not accepted into the Conservatory right away. Being only eight years old when the family arrived in Paris, she was a year too young to audition. Also, the only females who were previously accepted into the Conservatory were allowed to study harmony, piano, organ, harp keyboard harmony, and solfege only. Camilla competed against seventy-six boys for nine spots open in the violin class in front of an established panel of musicians, including Alard, Auber, Caraffa and Rossini. Although Lambert Massart took Camilla in without asking for pay, he was known for his rigorous coursework and strictness, keeping a stick on hand to beat any student that did not keep up. Camilla, despite being female, was not exempt from this punishment. According to Susan Kagan, ‚ÄúCamilla Urso had no real childhood; between the ages of seven and ten, while a student at the prestigious Paris Conservatory (the first girl ever admitted there), she practiced eight hours or more a day.‚Äù In 1852 in the annual student competition she won third place certificates of merit in solf√®ge and violin (Viotti's Violin Concerto No. 24).Pierre 1900, pp. 607 and 862. She was the first female student at the Conservatory to win a prize on violin.Le M√©nestrel (2 August 1903), p. 243. Career In the autumn of 1852 she appeared in New York City with her own company of assisting artists, including her father on flute. Reporting on her appearance at a private soir√©e, the Evening Post (27 September 1852) wrote: \\"She handles the violin with as much freedom and ease as a Spanish lady does her fan.\\"Lawrence 1995, p. 295. The Mirror (1 October 1852), reviewing her debut at Metropolitan Hall on 30 September, reported: \\"Her appearance was singularly prepossessing, her pose firm, correct, yet easy, and her little arm guided the bow with grace and precision. She breathed into the instrument a mellowness, an expression, a purity of sound truly remarkable. Even in the fortissimo parts she appeared to have the requisite strength, and the richness and fullness of her notes contrasted strangely with the delicate diminutiveness of this little mistress of the violin.\\" Urso was accompanied by an orchestra conducted by Theodore Eisfeld, and the program included the Viotti concerto, B√©riot's Air vari√©, and Alexandre Art√¥t's Souvenirs de Bellini. Boston concerts, 1863 Urso later appeared in Boston, Philadelphia, and other American cities. She was exceedingly successful, especially in concerts with Alboni and Sontag. In 1855 she and her parents established a residence in Nashville, Tennessee. Urso played with the Philharmonic Society in Boston in 1863, and later that same year in New York with the New York Philharmonic. In 1863‚Äì1864 she toured New England with the Patrick S. Gilmore band and in 1864‚Äì1865 went on tour in Canada. In June 1865 she appeared to great acclaim in Paris. For the next thirty years she toured the United States and abroad, including Australia and South Africa. She stopped performing in 1895 and lived in New York, where she taught privately and at the National Conservatory of Music. She died in New York and is buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery.

History Victaulic Patent filed on 4 April 1919 by Ernest Tribe The modern company known as Victaulic was founded in New York in 1925 to market mechanical, bolted couplings engage pipe grooves and use a gasket seal. The technology of joining pipe with bolted, mechanical couplings originated during World War I to speed up the deployment of fuel and water lines during battle. The original purpose of the Victaulic pipe joint was mainly for military applications but quickly gained popularity in other commercial and industrial markets. The concept emerged when inventor Lieutenant Ernest Tribe, of the Royal Engineers, devised a special form of joint for use on pipes and cylinders containing gasses and chemicals under very high pressure. Tribe, in conjunction with Dr Henry Hele-Shaw, a noted English hydraulic engineer, had been engaged by the British Government during the war to advance trench warfare tactics.Journal (American Water Works Association), Vol.9, No.6 (November,1922), pp. 921-927. And Associate Professor of Hydraulic and Sanitary Engineering, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, N.C., Chief Hydraulic Engineer, North Carolina Geological and Economic Survey Lt Tribe was among the first group of soldiers that were trained to operate a trench warfare weapon called a flamethrower. According to Thomas Wictor, the Author of ‚ÄúFlamethrower Troops of World War I: The Central and Allied Powers,‚Äù Lt Tribe accompanied the delivery of Vincent battery flamethrowers to allies in World War I and also trained soldiers in the use of the weapon. In the early phases of utilizing the flamethrower operators were experiencing noxious design problems. The flame tube that transferred oil would come apart, spraying operators with burning oil. The faulty connector on the flamethrower was one of Mr. Tribe‚Äôs inspirations to develop a more reliable product to join two pipes together, thus the Victory Joint emerged. On 4 April 1919, Lt Tribe filed the patent for what is now known as the Victaulic coupling. Shortly thereafter, the Victory Pipe Joint Co. was established in London, England and a second patent was filed in both names. Dr Hele-Shaw had numerous inventions including the multiple-plate clutch, stream-line filter, variable-pitch propeller, and Victaulic pipe joint. Dr Hele-Shaw was an enthusiast for inventing as well as an educator, engineer, pioneer, motorist, and sportsman. Later, in 1922, the words \\"Victory\\" and \\"Hydraulics‚Äù were combined and shortened to form a single word, Victaulic. Subsequently, Victaulic Company of America was founded in New York City in February 1925. WWII field installation with Victaulic couplings The concept of joining pipe with bolted mechanical couplings quickly gained popularity throughout World War II. The Victaulic coupling was used by Allied forces to accelerate the distribution of fuel and water to the troops. The coupling was invaluable for the troops because it decreased the difficulty of assembling and de-assembling pipe lines and allowed them to hasten distribution. The early installations of the Victaulic pipe joints included systems that needed flexibility; systems withstanding vibrations, shifting of soil, or other external influences. Victaulic fittings were very economical on space and were valuable in tunnels, ship work, and borings. The demand for dependable pipeline systems increased during World War II in direct correlation to the troops needing oil and petroleum. The earlier methods of distributing petroleum during war included shipping it overseas and dispersing by tank car, truck, or rail.A New Mission: Petroleum Distribution, 17 September 2013 Realizing the potential of pipeline systems, the War Department approved the request by the Quartermaster Corps proposing a new gasoline dispensing system on February 26, 1941. ‚ÄúThe Quartermaster Corps proposed to develop a pipeline as the primary means of delivering gasoline from tank cars to can and drum refilling points whenever tank trucks were not available or wherever features of terrain made the use of trucks impractical. All pipe, pumps, engines, hose, tools, and Victaulic couplings were standard commercial design.‚Äù Victaulic couplings or similarly designed couplings, consisting of a synthetic rubber gasket held in place by two semicircular metal castings, were used to assemble pipelines that would establish fuel dumps to the front line and keep the troops well supplied.

One legend is of a man who was cursed by the Devil to spend each night transformed into a wild boar, but when his secret was revealed by a local farmer, he burst into flames and disappeared into the nearby Devil's Punchbowl on Mangerton Mountain from which the Owengarriff River emerged to hide the entrance to his cave beneath the Torc Waterfall. There is also the story of how the legendary Irish warrior, Fionn MacCumhaill, killed a magical boar on Torc mountain with his golden spear.  Geography  Torc Mountain is part of the Mangerton Mountain Group which is a massif to the south of Killarney that includes 26 other named peaks with a height above .Mountainviews, (September 2013), \\"A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams & the Arderins\\", Collins Books, Cork, Torc sits in the north-west corner of the massif and immediately west of Torc Mountain is the subsidiary summit of Torc Mountain West Top . Torc's height and prominence, qualifies it on the British Isles Marilyn classification, as well as the Arderin classification.  Hill walking  View westwards into the Black Valley, with the wooden railway \\"sleeper\\" boardwalk visible at left. Torc is popular for hill walkers as it can be accessed from a marked stone-step path its base at Torc Waterfall, which then becomes a small road (the Old Kenmare Road) from the top of Torc Waterfall to the mountain itself, and then finishes with a track of wooden railway \\"sleepers\\" over the underlying bogland to its summit at . The route can thus be completed without full hiking boots, and requires no special navigational skills. View northwards down to Muckross Lake and Lough Leane. The summit of Torc has views of the Lakes of Killarney, the Black Valley, the MacGillycuddy's Reeks and Muckross House and grounds. The route from the Torc Waterfall car-park (at ), to the summit of Torc Mountain and back is 8‚Äìkilometres and takes 3 hours. Hill walkers can avoid the circa 100 steps of Torc Waterfall and start instead from the upper Torc Waterfall car-park (at 55 metres, ), to complete the shorter 7.5‚Äìkilometre hour 2.5‚Äìhour route to the summit of Torc Mountain, via the Old Kenmare Road, and back to the upper car-park. The northerly views from the summit of Torc Mountain can be achieved by climbing the steep stone steps up the lower Cardiac Hill, which is half-way up the north facing slopes of Torc Mountain, and which can be accessed from the N71 Road, half a kilometre from the Torc Waterfall car-park.

The mustard was developed in the English town of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, and gained a certain reputation in the 17th century, becoming a staple condiment of the kitchens of the time. Shakespeare mentions the mustard in Henry IV, Part 2, in which Falstaff has the line: ‚Äúhis wit's as thick as Tewkesbury Mustard‚Äù (Act 2, Scene 4, Line 244), describing the character of his friend Ned Poins. Mustard balls Originally the mustard was prepared by grinding the mustard seeds into mustard flour, combining this with finely-grated horseradish (and sometimes herbs and spices), then forming the mixture into balls which were then dried to aid preservation. The mustard balls would then be transported and sold in this form. To use the balls they would be broken apart then mixed with a liquid such as water, vinegar, wine, ale, beer, cider or fruit juice to soften them and mixed to a thick, creamy consistency. Often a sweetener such as honey would be added. The resulting mixture would then be used as a condiment just as mustard is used today, or as a cure for ailments. Today At the time of the Tewkesbury Festival in 1971 (a major programme of events commemorating the 850th anniversary of the consecration of the Abbey and the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Tewkesbury), the mustard was recreated on a commercial basis from the original recipe, though it is not made in Tewkesbury. Handmade mustard using local ingredients can still be purchased in Tewkesbury. The mustard can still be bought in ball format and even covered in gold leaf. Readily found in Tewkesbury's shops and the local mustard company 'The Tewkesbury Mustard Company' online. Figurative usage There is some evidence that ‚ÄúTewkesbury Mustard‚Äù came to be used as slang for incendiary 'fire-balls', a usage referred to in David Hume's History of England, in which he describes the rumour that the Great Fire of London was started by foreign arsonists trained by Jesuits \\"and the whole plan of operations was so concerted, that precautions were taken by the Jesuits to vary their measures, according to the variation of the wind. Fire-balls were familiarly called among them Tewkesbury mustard pills\\". Robert Hugh Benson‚Äôs refers to this in his historical novel Oddfish!, which contains the text: ‚ÄúWorkmen, too, were set to search and dig everywhere for \\"Tewkesbury mustard-balls,\\" as they were called‚Äîor fire-balls, with which it was thought that the Catholics would set London a-fire‚Äù. A similar line also appears in Alfred Marks' book Who Killed Sir Edmund Godfrey?. Thomas Firminger Thiselton-Dyer in his book ‚ÄúThe Folk-lore of Plants‚Äù (pub. 1889) gives evidence that the phrase ‚ÄúHe looks as if he lived on Tewkesbury mustard‚Äù came to be used as slang in Gloucestershire for those \\"who always have a sad, severe, and terrific countenance\\". In Shakespeare's Henry IV, 2. part, Falstaff says: \\"He a good wit? Hang him, baboon. His wit‚Äôs as thick as Tewksbury mustard. There‚Äôs no more conceit in him than is in a mallet\\" (Act 2, scene 4).

The Alphabetum grandonico- malabaricum focuses on the pronunciation of the Malayalam alphabet with many examples in Malayalam characters and includes some remarks on general characteristics of the grammar. At the end, there are also some short Malayalam sentences of a religious nature such as the ten commandments. The preface was written by Giovanni Cristofano Amaduzzi, an Italian philologist. The types for the Dravidian script were prepared by Clemente Peani. Amaduzzi supervised the publication of a series of grammars of Oriental languages at the printing press of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in Rome.

The Dororo and Guliguli languages (if they even existed) were transcriptional variants, dialects, or closely related. The speakers of Kazukuru gradually merged with the Roviana people from the sixteenth century onward and adopted Roviana as their language. Kazukuru was last recorded in the early twentieth century when its speakers were in the last stages of language shift. Today, Kazukuru is the name of a clan in the Roviana people group. Most of what is known about Kazukuru was collected by W.H.L. Waterhouse and published with S.H. Ray in an article in 1931. Some additional Kazukuru data and the only information on Dororo and Guliguli (two short wordlists) were published by Peter Lanyon-Orgill in 1953. Davis (2003) is skeptical that Guliguli ever existed, since the word guliguli has an obscene meaning in the neighboring Hoava language, and there is no memory among Hoava speakers of a neighboring language with that name. Guliguli was probably either a dialect of Kazukuru, a naive transcription of name Kazukuru, or even a hoax. Arthur Capell suggested that Kazukuru was a non-Austronesian (Papuan) language, and Stephen Wurm accordingly placed all three languages in a 'Kazukuru family' within the East Papuan phylum. However, Michael Dunn and Malcolm Ross (2007) argue that the structure, phonology and lexicon of Kazukuru are strikingly similar to Oceanic languages and that Kazukuru almost certainly was an Oceanic language, related to other New Georgia languages such as Roviana, Hoava and Ghanongga. The alleged Dororo and Guliguli wordlists are so similar to the recorded Kazukuru wordlist that they are almost certainly different transcriptions of the same language.

The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on 19 November, at 11:50pm, although it was a heavily edited version with approximately 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The film was unveiled to coincide with Oasis' compilation album Stop the Clocks, released on 20 November 2006. A preview of the film was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005. The film features a new Oasis song also called \\"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\\", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions, Gallagher described it as being \\"one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!\\".

It is located on a campus in Stuttgart, together with the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems.  Research focus  Research at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research is focused on the physics and chemistry of condensed matter, including especially complex materials and nanoscale science. In both of these fields, electronic and ionic transport phenomena are of particular interest.  Organization  The institute currently has eight departments. =Electronic Structure Theory= Led by Ali Alavi, the Department of Electronic Structure Theory is concerned with the development of ab initio methods for treating correlated electronic systems, using Quantum Monte Carlo, quantum chemical and many-body methodologies. Ab initio methods (including density functional theory) will be applied to problems of interest in heterogeneous catalysis, surface chemistry, electrochemistry, and photochemistry. =Solid State Spectroscopy= The Department of Solid State Spectroscopy is headed by Bernhard Keimer. Collective quantum phenomena in highly correlated electronic materials are studied by spectroscopic and scattering techniques. Topics of particular current interest include the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom in transition metal oxides, the mechanism of high- temperature superconductivity, and the control of electronic phase behavior in metal-oxide superlattices. The department also develops new spectroscopic methods such as high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and spectral ellipsometry. =Nanoscale Science= Research efforts in the Department of Nanoscale Science, directed by Klaus Kern, are centered on nanometer-scale science and technology with a focus on the bottom-up paradigm. The aim of the interdisciplinary research at the interface between physics, chemistry and biology is to gain control of materials at the atomic and molecular level, enabling the design of systems and devices with properties determined by quantum behavior on one hand and approaching functionalities of living matter on the other hand. =Nanochemistry= The Lotsch department employs modern techniques of nanochemistry and combines them with classical methods of solid- state synthesis to develop materials with complex property profiles, including two-dimensional systems and layered heterostructures, porous frameworks, photonic nanostructures, and solid electrolytes for applications in (photo)catalysis, sensing, and solid-state batteries. Our research vision is to translate fundamental research into sustainable material solutions to meet today‚Äôs global challenges, specifically in energy conversion and storage. =Physical Chemistry of Solids= Under Joachim Maier, the Department of Physical Chemistry of Solids is concerned with electrochemistry and ion transport. Emphasis is laid on ion conductors (such as inorganic or organic proton, metal ion and oxygen ion conductors) and mixed conductors (typically perovskites). The research ranges from the exploration of basic mechanisms to the design of materials for electrochemical applications (batteries, fuel cells, sensors). Of special significance is the scientific foundation of the field Nanoionics. =Solid State Quantum Electronics= Induced by quantum mechanical phenomena, heterostructures grown from complex materials offer a fascinating potential to create novel electron systems. Many have outstanding properties that are not otherwise found in nature. The design, growth, and exploration of such electron systems are at the focus of the Department of Solid State Quantum Electronics spearheaded by Klaus von Klitzing. =Quantum Many-Body Theory= Directed by Walter Metzner, Electronic properties of solids are analyzed and computed in the Department of Quantum Many-Body Theory with a main emphasis on systems where electronic correlations play a crucial role, such as cuprates, manganites and other transition metal oxides. Besides symmetry-breaking phase transitions leading to magnetism, orbital and charge order, or superconductivity, correlations can also cause electron localization and many other striking many-body effects not described by the independent electron approximation. =Quantum Materials= Entanglement of electrons in solids, in combination with details of the crystal lattice structure, produce a surprisingly rich variety of electronic phases, that are liquid, liquid- crystal and crystalline states of the charge and spin degrees of freedom. These complex electronic phases and the subtle competition among them very often give rise to novel functionality. The Department of Quantum Materials, led by Hidenori Takagi, is studying these interesting novel phases in transition metal oxides and related compounds where the narrow d-bands, which give rise to strong electron correlations, in combination with the rich chemistry of such materials provide excellent opportunities for new discoveries.  Scientific members  * Ali Alavi * Bernhard Keimer * Klaus Kern * Bettina Lotsch * Joachim Maier * Jochen Mannhart * Walter Metzner * Hidenori Takagi  Research groups  13 research groups have been established at the institute since 2005: * Organic Electronics (Hagen Klauk, since 2005) * Ultrafast Nanooptics (Markus Lippitz, junior professorship at the University of Stuttgart, 2006-2014) * Theory of Semiconductor Nanostructures (Gabriel Bester, 2007-2014) * Tunneling Spectroscopy of Strongly Correlated Electron Materials (Peter Wahl, 2009-2014) * Computational Approaches to Superconductivity (Lilia Boeri, 2009-2013) * Solid State Nanophysics (Jurgen Smet, since 2011) * Nanochemistry (Bettina Lotsch, 2011-2016) * Dynamics of Nanoelectronic Systems (Sebastian Loth, Collaboration with the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science, 2011-2018) * Nanoscale Functional Heterostructures (Ionela Vrejoiu, 2012-2015) * X-ray spectroscopy of oxide heterostructures (Eva Benckiser, since 2014) * Ultrafast Solid State Spectroscopy (Stefan Kaiser, junior professorship at the University of Stuttgart, since 2014) * Electronic Structure of Correlated Materials (Philipp Hansmann, 2015-2018) * Computational Quantum Chemistry for Solids (Andreas Gr√ºneis, 2015-2018)  International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS)  The International Max Planck Research School for Condensed Matter Science (IMPRS- CMS) is a joint program of the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research (Max Planck Institut f√ºr Festk√∂rperforschung) and the University of Stuttgart. The objective of the research school is high-quality fundamental research on condensed matter using advanced experimental and theoretical methods. The IMPRS takes on the challenge of creating an exciting, interdisciplinary PhD program that will motivate young scholars to choose a career in research.  Max Planck Graduate Center for Quantum Materials (GC-QM)  Several Max Planck Institutes all across Germany contribute to the overall research activities in this very intriguing field, and the Max Planck Graduate Center for Quantum Materials builds on the complementary research activities at the participating institutes. More specifically, we choose a strategy which will lead to strong synergy effects: the activities of the center will primarily allow students to experience every aspect of world-class research in a highly competitive field and - in a more general sense - also strengthen the existing bonds and collaborations, thus driving the field as such into the future.  Max Planck Center  The Max Planck-EPFL Center for Molecular Nanoscience and Technology Max Planck-EPFL Center for Molecular Nanoscience and Technology serves as a forum for cooperative research by bringing together scientists of the Max Planck Society and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL). The center explores novel scientific aspects of molecular nanostructures with a particular focus on new science relevant for sustainable energy, chemical sensing and biomedical technologies. The Max Planck-UBC-UTokyo Center for Quantum Materials is a collaborative venture between the Max Planck Society (Germany), University of British Columbia (Canada), and the University of Tokyo (Japan) featuring internationally recognized leading scientists and extensive infrastructure for research in quantum materials. This partnership supports collaborative projects, scholarly exchanges, annual workshops, and joint schools for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The center provides a platform for interdisciplinary exchange and cooperation.

Miniature art societies, such as the World Federation of Miniaturists (WFM), provide applicable definitions of the term.Size definitions of miniature painting An often-used definition is that a piece of miniature art can be held in the palm of the hand, or that it covers less than 25 square inches or 100 cm¬≤. Subjects are depicted in 1/6 actual size, and in all paintings the spirit of miniaturisation should be maintained. Miniature art has been made for over 1000 years and is prized by collectors. The U.S. White House, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Astolat Dollhouse Castle and museums around the world have collections of miniature paintings, drawings, original prints and etchings, and sculpture. Miniatures are executed on a very small scale for books or albums on perishable material such as paper and cloth. The Palas of Bengal were the pioneers of miniature painting in India. Miniature Art Societies hold annual shows around the world. The Miniature Art Society of Florida is possibly one of the largest miniature art shows in the USA. Galleries such as Seaside Art Gallery and The Snowgoose Gallery also hold annual international exhibitions where visitors are invited to view the paintings and sculptures under magnifying lenses.

The goal is to push toward an area where guide string has been dropped inside the confined space and to pull it through, so the guide string can then be used to pull through various types of wiring, such as phone wire, network cables or speaker wire. Fish tape is designed to pull through guide string only. Using it to directly pull the target wire can damage or warp the fish tape.  Design  Fish tapes are usually stored coiled on a plastic reel. Because of this, they have a natural curvature and it is this curvature that allows them to be guided. By manipulating the reel, the end of the tape can be directed slightly. The tape is rigid enough that it can then be pushed in the direction in which it is pointing. In this way it can be easily guided through an empty wall cavity. Thermal insulation, firestops, pipes, HVAC ducts, electrical conduits, and other obstructions make use of a fish tape more challenging. The \\"tape\\" can be made from many different materials including steel, fiberglass, and nylon. The tape usually has a special end ranging from a hook or loop to a specialized fastener device to allow the user to attach the tape to the guide string (or a very light cable) before pulling.  Double use  Occasionally, two fish tapes are used from opposite ends of the wall. Because they each have a hooked end, one fish tape is capable of catching the other, and the one tape can then be pulled back, carrying the second tape out with it. Electricians sometimes attach a battery and a doorbell or buzzer to two fish tapes so that when the ends of the tapes make contact with each other (within the wall), the bell rings.

It is not a widely known area, and is often referred to as a housing estate or just an area of Crumlin. It is serviced by the 150, 15a and 54a bus routes. The local community centre plays host to the PME Variety Group, Robert Emmet's GAA Club, and Manortown United Football Club. The town has two public houses and a restaurant. The local primary school is St. Damian's, and the Church of the Holy Spirit Kimmage Manor is the local Roman Catholic parish church.  Borders of Perrystown  According to Francis Elrington Ball, the author of History of County Dublin (1902), the extensive civil parish of Crumlin in the nineteenth century contained the townland of Perrystown. Early ordnance survey maps show the borders of Perrystown from the Dublin city county border line on the Whitehall Road (including Kimmage Manor and the river Poddle) to the start of Willington roundabout, taking in both sides of Templeville Road up to Grovenor Court. Perrystown also includes the Whitehall Road West up to Hillsbrook Ave, taking in all of Muckross and Rockfield Avenue down to the county border line with Dublin city.

A minority also exists in Zambia. In 2001 the Lambya population was estimated to number 85,000, including 45,000 in Malawi and 40,000 (from a 1987 estimate) in Tanzania.  Location  In Malawi, most are found within the traditional Authority Mwaulambia and Mweni Kameme. Chitipa district is the north most district in northern region of Malawi (formerly known as Forthill during the colonial times). The present name Chitipa means big mud (I-chitope).  Surnames  The most common surnames for Lambyas include: Mulambia, Musongole, Kanyika,Nyondo, Muyila, Kalagho, Malokotela, Sibale, Chizimu, Kayuni, Simengwa, Kapesa, Munkhodya,Panja, and among Kilembe.  Language  The people speak Lambya (ichilambya). Nouns often start with 'i' or 'u'. For further information on the language, and a short text ('The Hare and the Tortoise'), see the external link below to the Language Mapping Survey for Northern Malawi, p. 62\\\\.  The Establishment and Expansion of the Lambya Kingdom  Lambya kingdom, a small polity in Chitipa District, which forms the northernmost tip of the modern Republic of Malawi. It was a small political unit but nevertheless historically important because its inhabitants belong to a larger cluster of peoples hereafter referred to as the Ngulube group, which comprises Safwa, Bena, Kinga, Nyakyusa and Ndali of southern Tanzania and the Sukwa and Ngonde of Malawi. Ideally the traditions of all these peoples should be correlated for a fuller understanding of what constitutes one historical area. The article discusses four main themes: the problem of sources, the establishment of the Lambya state, its relations with its neighbors and its early territorial expansion. Ulambya, as the country of the Lambya is called, covers an area of 367 square miles and has a population of roughly 20 thousand people with an average density of 36 persons per square mile, the largest concentration being in the more fertile valleys of Kaseye, and the Songwe (Stobbs and Young, 1972: 40; Young and Brown, 1972: 30). The Lambya share a border to the north with the Ndali of Tanzania and the Nyiha on the west with the Namwanga of Zambia, on the south with the Fungwe, Tambo and the Tumbuka- speaking peoples of Mwenewenya, and on the east with the Sukwa. The Lambya are worthy of attention for a number of reasons. Ulambya is one of the oldest states in the area and the dating of its regnal list should assist in the problem of working out a chronology of the Ngulube group. A study of the Lambya should also contribute to an understanding of the problems that attended the early development of small polities and give the Lambya a proper place in the early history of the wider zone.  Culture  The people are very hospitable, usually they slaughter a chicken as part of welcoming a visitor. Most would be offended if a person refused to have a meal with them, if one insists that they are satisfied, the best approach is to eat very little. Complete refusal to eat their food might give them a picture that you are stingy so you yourself want them also to refuse to eat when they visit you or you suspect that they may have included medicine in the food (Ukukutegha). It is cultural to quickly prepare ubughali, that is thick porridge made from maize flour eaten together withand relish, for a visitor so that they should replenish the energy. Normally food is eaten after washing hands from a common dish (elderly wash first in the order of age) all the participants will eat from the same plate. It is expected that the elder should stop eating where a small piece of food remains for the younger children at the table. Evening Left-overs are a delicacy the next morning especially when the relish is boiled beans. Lambya people also cherish gourd (akapale) soured milk. Burial Rites Death among the Lambya traditional is respected. Whenever death takes place whether of a man, woman, or a Child a series of funeral rites lasting a month or more begins. The first of the series is the burial (Kusyira umuvimba) which in the case of most adults last three or four days, though for rich man it may continue for a week and for a child it is over in a day. As soon as death occurs most of the time women who are present begins wailing and messages are sent to the chiefs, the village headman and dead mans kinsmen and affine to announce the fact and bid them to the burial. The first message is sent to the father or to a senior brother or sister if one is still alive or calling them to heir of the dead person. The fact about the dead man is announced in the village by the chief, who usually get the consent to do so from the deceased family. In sending the passage to the chief the deceased family also asks the chief permission of a drum which is kept by the chief. This drum is used to send message further in the village and it acts a symbol of funeral. The drumming of the drum has got its rhythm that tells the people about the funeral as result they easily differentiate the funeral and the entertainment drum styles. To get all these permission the deceased family basically presents a hen or cock to the chief (umwene) and then the message spread.

It runs from PA 61 in Leesport southeast to the New Jersey state line on the Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge over the Delaware River in Philadelphia, where the road continues as New Jersey Route 73\\\\. The route passes through rural areas of Berks County, crossing U.S. Route 222 (US 222) in Maiden Creek before heading southeast through Oley and Boyertown. PA 73 continues into Montgomery County and intersects PA 100 in Gilbertsville and PA 29 in Schwenksville before it heads into the northwest suburbs of Philadelphia. The route passes through Skippack and intersects US 202 in Center Square, PA 309 in Springfield Township, and PA 611 near Jenkintown. PA 73 continues through Northeast Philadelphia on Cottman Avenue, crossing US 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and US 13 (Frankford Avenue) before coming to an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) near the Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge. Predating the Interstate and U.S. Highway Systems, the Skippack Pike, a modern section of the route, served as the primary connector between Philadelphia and the northwest suburbs. The Skippack Pike dates back to 1713 and was completed as a turnpike in 1855. Legislative Route 197 connected Reading to Philadelphia along the PA 73 corridor in 1911. PA 73 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 23 near Blue Ball to US 1 in Philadelphia, heading north to Reading and northeast to Oley before heading southeast to Philadelphia. The route was extended east to the Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge after it opened in 1929. The portion of route between Leesport and Maiden Creek became the eastern part of PA 383 by 1930. PA 73 was shifted to its current alignment in eastern Montgomery County in the 1950s. The western terminus of PA 73 was realigned to Leesport by 1966, with the route between Blue Ball and Reading becoming PA 625 with most of the remainder between Reading and Oley now unnumbered. PA 73 was realigned to its current routing to Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge in the 1960s, having previously followed Frankford Avenue and Robbins and Levick streets on a one- way pair.

PA 73 ends on the bridge at the New Jersey state line, at which point Route 73 continues into the borough of Palmyra, New Jersey. History Former Reading designation of PA 73 The Skippack Pike, a portion of PA 73 between Skippack and Bethlehem Pike in Whitemarsh, dates back to 1713, when settlers in Skippack petitioned Philadelphia officials for a road to their community for purposes of hauling grain to the mill in Whitemarsh. During the American Revolutionary War, George Washington's army suffered a defeat at the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777 and had to encamp along the Skippack Pike until October 8\\\\. The Americans later marched east on the road while preparing for a counterattack at the Battle of White Marsh. The Skippack Turnpike Company was incorporated in 1845 to construct a turnpike from Whitemarsh to Skippack but the project was abandoned after several efforts. In 1853, a second charter was granted and the turnpike was completed in 1855 near Worcester Township. When the state began maintenance over roads via the Sproul Road Bill that was signed on May 31, 1911, the system did not include the direct Reading‚ÄìPhiladelphia routes that PA 73 and US 422 are today. PA 73 was adopted as Legislative Route 197, the main route that connected Philadelphia and its northwest suburbs. Legislative Routes paved the way for Pennsylvania's first Traffic Routes in 1924 and a new set of routes, including PA 73, that were added in the late 1920s. In the original 1928 routing, PA 73 ran between PA 23 near Blue Ball and US 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard) in Philadelphia. The route followed the New Holland Road north through Bowmansville and Knauers to Reading, where it passed through the city along US 222 (Lancaster Avenue), Bingaman Street, Chestnut Street, and US 422 (Perkiomen Avenue). From Reading, PA 73 split from US 422 in Mount Penn and followed Carsonia Avenue and Friedensburg Road to Oley, where it picked up its current routing to Cheltenham Township. Here, PA 73 continued east along Church Road, Township Line Road, and Cottman Avenue to US 1. Upon being designated, PA 73 was paved between south of Reading and Schwenksville and between Skippack and Philadelphia. After the Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge was built in 1929, the eastern terminus was moved to its current location on the bridge at the New Jersey state line. It followed Cottman Avenue, US 13 (Frankford Avenue), and US 422 (Levick Street) to the bridge. By 1930, PA 73 was paved in the Bowmansville area and from south of Reading to south of Angelica; the remainder of the route between Blue Ball and Reading was under construction at this time. The route was also paved between Schwenksville and Skippack. Also, the current route between US 120 (now PA 61) in Leesport and US 22 (now US 222) in Maiden Creek became a paved extension of PA 383, which continued west from Leesport to PA 83 (now PA 183) near Leinbachs. In the 1930s, PA 383 was realigned off the present-day route west of Ontelanuee Drive, having been rerouted to head north on Ontelaunee Drive. By 1940, the entire length of PA 73 was paved. The route was realigned to follow Greenwood Avenue from Church Road to Jenkintown, where it turned southeast onto Township Line Road. Also in the 1930s, US 422/PA 73 was shifted to follow Mineral Spring Road between Reading and Mount Penn. In 1950, PA 73 was moved to a straighter alignment to the east of Oley. PA 73 (Cottman Avenue) westbound past PA 232 (Oxford Avenue) and Rising Sun Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia In the 1950s, PA 73 was routed onto the one- way pair of Robbins Street eastbound and Levick Street westbound between US 13 (Frankford Avenue) and the Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge; the US 422 concurrency was removed as well. Also, the route was realigned to use Washington Lane between Church Road and Township Line Road. Between Reading and Mount Penn, US 422/PA 73 was shifted to the one-way pair of Perkiomen Avenue eastbound and Mineral Spring Road westbound while PA 73 was designated concurrent with westbound US 422 Alt. on Chestnut Street between Bingaman Street and US 422 in Reading. By 1966, PA 73 was realigned at Oley to follow its current alignment west to PA 61 in Leesport, replacing a portion of PA 383 between east of Leesport and Maiden Creek. The former alignment of PA 73 became PA 625 between PA 23 in Blue Ball and US 222 (now US 222 Bus.) in Reading with most of the remainder between Reading and Oley becoming unnumbered except along the concurrencies with US 222 and US 422 Bus. In the 1960s, PA 73 was rerouted at US 13 (Frankford Avenue) to follow Cottman Avenue, the one-way pair of Princeton Avenue eastbound and Cottman Avenue westbound past Torresdale Avenue, State Road, and New State Road to the Tacony‚ÄìPalmyra Bridge. On November 24, 1998, an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly designated the portion of PA 73 between North Wales Road and Butler Pike in Whitpain Township as the POW/MIA Memorial Highway in honor of soldiers who are prisoner of war (POW) or missing in action (MIA). On November 26, 2008, a Pennsylvania General Assembly act designated the section of PA 73 along Cottman Avenue between Central Avenue and Algon Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia the Police Sergeant Stephen Liczbinski Memorial Highway in honor of an officer of the Philadelphia Police Department who was killed in the line of duty; signs were installed in 2012. PA 73 westbound past Butler Pike in Broad Axe In 2009, a $212.3 million project began to reconstruct the interchange between PA 73 and I-95 as part of rebuilding the stretch of I-95 through Northeast Philadelphia. The first phase of the project relocated the ramp to southbound I-95 from Princeton Avenue to Longshore Street, converted Princeton Avenue and Cottman Avenue to two-way traffic, reconstructed and widened State Road at the interchange, and added an on-ramp spur from Milnor Street to the ramp from Princeton Avenue to northbound I-95. On August 31, 2011, Cottman Avenue became a two-way road between Torresdale Avenue and State Road, carrying one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes. The first phase was completed in 2012. The second phase of the interchange reconstruction, which lasted from late 2012 to January 2018, reconstructed and widened I-95 in the vicinity of the PA 73 interchange, added improvements to surface streets crossing under I-95, and rebuilt the ramps from both directions of I-95 and the ramp to northbound I-95. The final phase of the project will build a ramp from Cottman Avenue to southbound I-95 and construct utility improvements; work on this phase is expected to begin in late 2020 or early 2021. In 2009, a roundabout was constructed at the intersection of PA 29 and PA 73 in Lower Frederick Township; crashes decreased at this junction after the roundabout opened. On March 29, 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation announced plans to construct roundabouts at both intersections between PA 73 and PA 662 in Oley Township. Construction of the roundabouts, which cost $5.7 million, began in April 2019. The roundabout at PA 73 and PA 662 on the eastern end of Oley opened on August 19, 2019 while the roundabout at PA 73 and PA 662 on the western end of Oley opened in November 2019. Major intersections PA 73 Alternate Truck =Schwenksville= Pennsylvania Route 73 Alternate Truck is a truck route bypassing a weight-restricted bridge over the East Branch Perkiomen Creek near Schwenksville. The route follows Plank Road and PA 29\\\\. It was formed in 2019. =Oreland= Pennsylvania Route 73 Alternate Truck are truck routes of PA 73 that bypass a weight-restricted bridge over a branch of the Wissahickon Creek at the PA 309 interchange in Oreland, on which trucks over 36 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. The eastbound alternate truck route follows PA 309 and Paper Mill Road. The westbound alternate truck route follows Paper Mill Road and Bethlehem Pike. There is also a PA 73 Alt. Truck for traffic from northbound PA 309 to access westbound PA 73, following PA 309 north from PA 73 to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) interchange, where it utilizes the cloverleaf ramps to return to southbound PA 309 and head south to the PA 73 exit. PA 73 Alt. Truck was signed in 2013.

Biography Karl Sterrer was the son of the sculptor Carl Sterrer. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna under Alois Delug and Christian Griepenkerl. Equally adept at both landscapes and portraits, he won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1908. This was followed by many more awards, including the Reichel Prize, in 1919. Around 1910 Sterrer was one of the first Austrian artists to be intrigued by the beginnings of German Expressionism. Building upon the deep, dark lines of drypointing, Sterrer began to cut his landscape compositions to their essentials. During the first two decades of the twentieth century, Sterrer worked and traveled extensively in Germany and Austria. In 1921, he accepted the post of Professor of Fine Arts at the Vienna Academy. Today, examples of Sterrer's original prints and paintings are housed in the collections of the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, the Dresden Gallery and the Austrian Academy in Vienna.

He was described in \\"Tularosa: Last of the Frontier West\\" () as \\"magnificently muscled, straight as a young pine, catlike in his coordination\\". \\"He had his mother's piercing black eyes which seemed to bore into you, and a chin like the rock of Gibraltar, but he always spoke softly.\\" (A description of him at the age of 19.) \\"Oliver Lee would turn a man off quicker for abusing a horse than for any other reason.\\" (Sonnichsen) \\"Dee Harkey in his \\"The Life of a New Mexico Lawman - Mean as Hell\\" () stated he had many dealings with Oliver Lee and \\"so far as I know or ever heard, he always dealt on the square.\\" Nevertheless, it was not long before a range war of the Lincoln County type began to fester. Early New Mexico life Lee moved into the area from Texas with his half brother Perry Altman. They planned to raise and sell horses as well as to acquire land. C.L Sonnichsen relates that Oliver and Perry soon met Cherokee Bill. He suggested that they buy out \\"Frenchy\\" who had a place in Dog Canyon where he was raising fruit trees. He told them the area had a reliable water source. Perry is quoted as saying, \\"Well, Oliver this country is so damn sorry I think we can stay here a long time and never be bothered by anybody else.\\" Lee's fair play ethics did not set well with the local powerbrokers. The local power brokers at the time were Albert Fountain, John Good and others. Lee later became friends with Albert Fall. The alliance would last for decades. It also put him on the side of the Democrats, who were at odds with the Republican faction led by Colonel Albert Jennings Fountain. Fountain was a powerful rival to land owners Lee and Fall. The struggle between them was characterized in the book \\"The Two Alberts - Fountain and Fall\\" (). The political party in the majority in the area was the Republican, and these were an extension of the Santa Fe Ring, a secret coalition of lawmakers determined to control public offices in the New Mexico Territory. Albert Jennings Fountain murder case The range war came to a boil in the winter of 1895-6. Colonel Fountain had gone to the Lincoln County court and obtained 32 indictments against 23 ranchers for theft of livestock or defacement of brands. Oliver Lee, Jim Gililland and William McNewWilliam \\"Billy\\" McNew - there were two men by the name of \\"William McNew\\" ranching in Otero County, New Mexico. William H. McNew was born circa 1859 in Arkansas or Missouri, and is most likely not Billy McNew. The second William McNew was born in Texas, circa 1866, and is most likely the Lee confederate. were among the accused. This caused their being suspects in the February 1896 disappearance and presumed murder of Colonel Fountain and his 8-year-old son Henry. They were pursued by Sheriff Pat Garrett and a posse. Garrett and posse engaged in a gunbattle with Lee and Gililland near Alamogordo at Wildy Well, with Deputy Sheriff Kurt Kearney being killed. Lee later testified that Kearney and Garrett shot at Lee and Gililland, who were sleeping on the roof of the house at Wildy Well. Lee claimed the two were fired upon without being given the option to surrender, with him and Gililland returning fire. After Deputy Kearney was shot, Sheriff Garrett negotiated a truce and retreated with the mortally wounded Kearney. It was almost three years before the matter was settled in court. These events led to the political maneuvering which led to the formation of Otero County. Lee believed that if he surrendered to Garrett he would never make it to trial. This is attested to in Dee Harkey's book \\"The Life of a New Mexico Lawman - Mean as Hell\\" (). Lee's friend, Albert Fall and other Democrats offered to honor Otero, the Republican Governor, with the creation of a county named after him. The boundary of this new county would put the location, and so the jurisdiction of the Fountain case, in the new county. The only thing the Democrats wanted in exchange was that the sheriff of the new county would be their choice. Once the county was established and Lee's friend, George Curry was appointed sheriff, Lee promptly surrendered. Albert Fall and others defended Lee, McNew and Gilliland, who were charged with and tried in Hillsboro, New Mexico, for the crime of killing Henry Fountain (Albert's young son). No one was ever charged with the murder of Albert Fountain. Charges against McNew were dismissed, while Lee and Gililland were acquitted. Dee Harkey notes that it was interesting that none of the other ranchers indicted were ever pursued as suspects. Oliver Lee later held office in the New Mexico Senate and continued operating his ranches until his own death in 1941. He has several descendants still living and ranching in New Mexico.

It served the same purpose as Turner Entertainment's distribution unit, with the exception that TPS was more involved in distributing television series rather than films. Founded in 1982, the company was originally responsible for syndicating Turner-produced programs (such as the syndicated game show Starcade) as well as developing programming for TBS such as Night Tracks. TPS expanded its distribution into other networks' series in the 1990s, syndicating series such as The Wonder Years (which is now owned by 20th Television since 2011). When Turner bought the rights to the Hanna-Barbera library of cartoons, TPS became their distributor to local stations. TPS was also responsible for handling distribution and sales for CNN Newsource. One of the more notable series TPS was responsible for developing was Captain Planet and the Planeteers, which was a co-production with DiC Entertainment and centered on a character created by Turner Broadcasting founder Ted Turner. DiC and Turner combined on the development of the series while TPS was responsible for the distribution of the series, which aired on both TBS and in syndication. (When the series' sequel, The New Adventures of Captain Planet, debuted in 1993, Turner Entertainment through Hanna-Barbera developed and produced the series on its own, and neither TPS nor DiC was involved.) Also, earlier in 1986, TPS, with the help of veteran anime translator Fred Ladd, produced a second English translation of the 1970s anime Science Ninja Team Gatchaman called G-Force: Guardians of Space, which would subsequently air on TBS (1986) and Cartoon Network (1995‚Äì1997). TPS also held partial distribution rights to G-Force (along with King Features Entertainment) until all rights to the series reverted to license holder Sandy Frank Entertainment in 2003. Upon Time Warner's purchase of Turner in 1996, TPS was absorbed into Telepictures Distribution, which is now part of Warner Bros.

The church played an important part in the life of Rembrandt and was the subject of a painting by Claude Monet.\\"Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections Object : The Zuiderkerk, Amsterdam (Looking up the Groenburgwal).\\" Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections Object : The Zuiderkerk, Amsterdam (Looking up the Groenburgwal). N.p., n.d. Web. 1 May 2013. . Construction The Zuiderkerk was the city's first church built specifically for Protestant services. It was constructed between 1603 and 1611 and stands on the Zuiderkerkhof (\\"Southern Churchyard\\") square near the Sint Antoniesbreestraat. The distinctive church tower, which dominates the surrounding area, was not completed until 1614 and contains a carillon of bells built by the brothers Hemony, installed in 1656 along with four bells which are rang monthly? The design of the church in Amsterdam Renaissance style is by Hendrick de Keyser, who was also buried in the church in 1621. A memorial stone was placed on top of his tomb in 1921. De Keyser designed the church as a pseudo-basilica in Gothic style, with a central nave and two lower side aisles, six bays long, with Tuscan columns, timber barrel vaults and dormers. The stained glass in the rectangular windows was replaced by transparent glass in the 17th century. The richly detailed tower is a square stone substructure, on which an octagonal sandstone section stands with free-standing columns on the corners. On top of this is a wooden, lead-covered spire. Three of Rembrandt's children were buried in the Zuiderkerk, which is very near to Rembrandt's house in the Jodenbreestraat. Ferdinand Bol, one of Rembrandt's most famous pupils, was buried in the Zuiderkerk in 1680. According to local legend, Rembrandt painted the Night Watch at the church because his own studio was too small. However, the story is highly disputed and most likely untrue. The Zuiderkerk was used for church services until 1929. During the final (1944-1945) winter of World War II, known as the hongerwinter (\\"hunger winter\\") in the Netherlands because food was so scarce, the church was in use as a temporary morgue because people were dying faster than they could be buried. The church was closed in 1970 because it was at the point of collapse. In the years 1976-1979, the church underwent renovation, and since 1988 it serves as a municipal information centre, with regularly changing exhibitions as well as a permanent exhibition which features a scale model of Amsterdam as it is envisioned in 2020. Since June 2006, the church also houses the \\"Wall of Fame\\", a homage to Dutch celebrities who have made a positive contribution to society, such as charitable work. The honourees include Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen, renowned former soccer player Johan Cruijff and four-time Olympic swimming champion Inge de Bruijn. The church is open to the public and currently serves as a municipal information center with exhibitions on housing and the environment. Burials * Richard Clyfton * Hendrick de Keyser Gallery French Impressionist painter Claude Monet painted the church during a visit to the Netherlands. There is some confusion about the date of this painting, but it was probably one of 12 paintings made by Monet in 1874 during a visit to Amsterdam. The composition is centred on the church spire, with the Groenburgwal canal leading up to it in the foreground. The reflections of the buildings on the water are represented by yellow brushstrokes only, with no detail to them. The painting now hangs in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The parade passes down the Champs- √âlys√©es from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde where the President of the French Republic, his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand. It is a popular event in France, broadcast live on television; it is also one of the oldest regular military parades in the world.French diplomatic mission in San Francisco www.consulfrance-sanfrancisco.org. The Trooping of the Colour or Queen's Birthday Parade in London has been held regularly since 1820: In some years, invited detachments of foreign troops take part in the parade and foreign statesmen attend as guests. Smaller military parades are held in French garrison cities (most notably Marseille, Toulon, Brest, Rochefort and Belfort). Organisation and parade summary Foreign Legion As the President of the French Republic arrives via a convoy of the Republican Guard to the Arc de Triomphe, he is greeted by the parade commander, who informs him that the parade is now ready for inspection. He then rides the Chief of Defense Staff's vehicle to inspect the troops on the Champs-Elys√©es escorted by troopers and officers of the Republican Guard's cavalry regiment and its mounted band, waving on the crowds lining up on the boulevard. After he disembarks from the vehicle he finishes the inspection through one done for the Republican Guard Infantry units, then walks to the stage on the Place de la Concorde to meet the dignitaries present. In recent years the parade has started with military bands from the French Armed Forces taking the stage with band exhibitions and drill shows, sometimes including displays from foreign service troops and mounted units; plus military and civil choirs singing classic French patriotic songs. This opening ends with the playing of La Marseillaise, the National Anthem of France.

Competition between those schools often led to some practical pranks: Polytechnique is a highly selective engineer school (considered as the most difficult in the country) whose students reverse most of the time to civilian occupation while Saint Cyr is a professional officer school. As a consequence students from the first have occasionally \\"mined\\" the path for their colleagues using sticky or slippery products. The Patrouille de France leads the fly-past of the French Air Force and Naval Aviation. Recently, it has become customary to invite units from France's close allies to participate in the parade. For instance, in 2004, to mark the centenary of the Entente Cordiale, British troops (the band of the Royal Marines, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, Grenadier Guards and King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery) led the Bastille Day parade in Paris, with the Red Arrows flying overhead. While British troops had participated in the Bastille Day parades of 14 July 1919 and 1939 (see below), this was the first occasion that invited foreign troops had actually led the parade.http://www.entente-cordiale.org In 2007, the parade opened with detachments from all member states of the European Union, flying the European flag. The European anthem was played. The parade follows with foot soldiers: army infantry; troupes de Marine; Air; Gendarmerie Nationale, including the Republican Guard; and occasionally non-military police and fire units. The French Foreign Legion always brings up the rear of this part of the parade, because their ceremonial marching pace is slower than that of other French infantry units. It is the only participant that does not split up when passing by the officials and the army headquarters' tribune. Motorised and armoured troops come next, and the parade traditionally ends with the popular Paris Fire Brigade (which is a military unit in the French Army). At the same time, above the Champs-Elys√©es, the flypast continues with French Air Force and Naval Air Force planes and helicopters, and aircraft from the National Gendarmerie, the Interior Ministry's Civil Security Air Service and the various fire-fighting units nationwide. The parade ends with a parachute display by selected parachutists from the French Armed Forces. 2011's finale saw a gymnastic exhibition and fire truck demonstration by Paris Fire Brigade personnel. History =Early years= Originally a popular feast, Bastille day became militarised during the Directory. Under Napoleon, the celebration lost much of its importance, though it came back into fashion during the Third Republic. The Fourteenth of July became the official national celebration on 28 June 1880, and a decree of 6 July the same year linked a military parade to it. Between 1880 and 1914 the celebrations were held at the Longchamp Racecourse in the Bois de Boulogne, Paris. Since World War I the parade has been held on the Champs-√âlys√©es, the first occasion being the d√©fil√© de la Victoire (\\"Victory parade\\") led by Marshals Joseph Joffre, Ferdinand Foch and Philippe P√©tain on 14 July 1919. This was not however a French National Holiday parade, although held upon the same date, but one agreed upon by the Allied delegations to the Versailles Peace Conference. A separate Victory parade of Allied troops was held in London four days later.London 'Peace Parade' 19 July 1919 . Retrieved 12 August 2010 =After World War I= Greek soldiers at the World War I victory parade on 14 July 1919. The temporary catafalque erected at the time is visible to the right of the Arc de Triomphe. On the occasion of 14 July 1919 parade in Paris, detachments from all of France's World War I allies took part in the parade, together with colonial and North African units from France's overseas Empire.pages 50‚Äì51 \\"To Lose a Battle ‚Äì France 1940, The latter, most notably squadrons of Algerian Spahis mounted on Arab horses and in traditional full dress uniform, continued to participate in the annual parade until the end of the Algerian War in 1962. In the Second World War, the German troops occupying Paris and Northern France paraded along the same route. A victory parade under General de Gaulle was held upon the restoration in 1945 of Paris to French rule while within the period of occupation by the Germans a company of the commando Kieffer of the Forces Navales Fran√ßaises Libres had continued the French National Holiday parade in the streets of London. =Recent developments= In 1971 female personnel were included for the first time amongst the troops parading. Under Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing the parade route was changed each year with troops marching down from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la R√©publique to commemorate popular outbreaks of the French Revolution:http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr * 1974: Bastille-R√©publique (No mobile column and flypast that year, only the mounted and ground columns) * 1975: Cours de Vincennes * 1976: Champs-√âlys√©es * 1977: √âcole militaire * 1978: Champs-√âlys√©es * 1979: R√©publique-Bastille * 1980: Champs-Elys√©es. Under Presidents Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac the parade route returned to the Champs-Elys√©es where it continues to be held. 1989's parade was one of the biggest, which would mark the bicentennial year since the outbreaks of the Revolution in Paris. In 1994, troops of the Eurocorps, including German soldiers, paraded on the invitation of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. The event was seen as symbolic of both European integration, and German-French reconciliation.http://www.elysee.fr In 1999, for the \\"Year of Morocco\\" in France, the Moroccan Royal Guard opened the parade, in the presence of King Hassan II of Morocco. In 2002, the cadets of the United States Military Academy and surviving FDNY firefighters paraded.NYC firemen at Bastille parade CNN 14 July 2002 In 2004, British troops from the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards, paraded to celebrate the centenary of the Entente cordiale. On an earlier occasion detachments of the British Brigade of Guards and Royal Marines had participated in the Bastille Day Parade of 14 July 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II.page181 \\"The Illustrated London News ‚Äì Marching to War 1933‚Äì39\\", In 2005, \\"year of Brazil\\" in France, two Brazilian units opened the parade and the smoke squadron (a Brazilian air demonstration squadron) ended the fly-past in the presence of President Lula. In 2007, president Nicolas Sarkozy invited all the 26 other EU member states to join the parade with a detachment of their armed services.Join the parade, Sarkozy tells EU armies, The Daily Telegraph, 8 June 2007 2008's Bastille Day Parade saw a United Nations Security Council/Secretariat-DPKO battalion leading the parade march past from UNDOF, UNFICYP and UNIFIL. In 2009, the parade opened with a contingent of Indian troops drawn from the three services (Indian Army, Indian Navy & Indian Air Force. President Nicolas Sarkozy invited Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to attend the event as the guest of honour. Soldiers including Jawans of Maratha Light Infantry Regiment Centre (MLIRC) marched down the Champs Elysees to the sound of an Indian military band playing Indian martial tunes including Saare Jahan Se Achcha, Haste Lushai and Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja. To celebrate 50 years of independence of the French African colonies, the 2010 parade saw troops from several former French African colonies' armed forces lead the parade. The 2011 parade celebrated the French overseas possessions and the 200 years of the French firefighting service. That same year, former judge and Green politician Eva Joly called for an end to 14 July parade practice, saying that it should be replaced with a \\"citizens' parade\\". 1st French Infantry Regiment in Paris in 2012 Drone presented during the 2015 parade The 2012 parade was led by the Armed Forces units in Afghanistan (the Foreign Legion included), several NATO countries' armed forces, and France's UN peacekeeping units. A parachutist who took part in the parade's finale parachute display was injured and taken care of at once by the medical personnel, in front of everyone in attendance. 2013's parade saw troops from Mali (including members of the French-led multinational intervention force) and Croatia, the newest EU member, march past. The Hector Berlioz arrangement of the national anthem was played on this parade by the band of the Troupes de Marine (forming the medal of the National Order of Merit on the grounds of the Place de la Concorde together with civilian participants forming the ribbon) and the French Army Chorus with soloist Florian Laconi, honouring the golden jubilee of the foundation of the National Order of Merit. To mark the centennial of the outbreak of the First World War, the 2014 parade started with a detachment of soldiers wearing the 1916 blue- grey French uniform which was followed by colour guards from the 69 other countries involved in the Great War aside from France itself. Among the countries represented included nations from the former Soviet Union (ex. Russia, Moldova,https://www.army.md/img/userfiles/publicatii/om/archive/08(2014).pdf Belarus, Tajikistan) nations from the British Commonwealth (ex. New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom) and other allied nations such as the United States and former French colonies. The motorised parade ended with a limber team carrying a 75mm field gun, immediately behind the mounted French Republican Guard Cavalry Regiment. The 2014 parade ended with a choreographic performance by Jos√© Montalvo.Rosita Boisseau, Jos√© Montalvo, 250 jeunes, autant de colombes en cl√¥ture du d√©fil√© du 14 juillet, Le Monde, 13 July 201414 juillet: d√©fil√© du Centenaire sur les Champs Elys√©es, Lib√©ration, 14 July 2014 The performance included 250 young dancers from the eighty countries which fought in the war; it took place on the Place de la Concorde. The eight-minute performance to a clarinet concerto by Mozart included echoes to La Sardane de la paix and La Colombe, two paintings by Pablo Picasso, as well as Les Oiseaux by Georges Braque. The dancers released doves at the end of the performance, a symbol of peace through strength after the military parade. The national anthem and classic French patriotic songs La Madelon and Chant du d√©part were sung a cappella by the French Army Chorus during the pre-parade segment. Bastille Day 2016 military parade in Paris The 2015 edition, which had 250 less personnel due to domestic and international deployments of the French uniformed services, celebrated the 70th year since the end of the Second World War and the liberation of France from the Axis, as well as France's determination to fight all forms of terrorism. This parade saw the debut appearance of two special forces units of the French National Police and the GIGN from the National Gendarmerie, which had seen action during January's Charlie Hebdo shooting incident as well as cadets of the Heroic Military Academy, Heroic Naval School and the Air Force College from Mexico. In tribute to all the French fallen and veterans of the Second World War the Patrouille de France flew over the dais, in Cross of Lorraine formation. The pre-parade segment saw the French Navy Band forming the same formation together with the French Army Chorus, which sung Le Chant des Partisans a capella before singing the national anthem. In celebration of 70 years since the liberation of France and the end of the Second World War in Europe, these were joined by six recipients of the Order of Liberation, and colour guards of units that had been awarded with the order for their actions as part of the Free French forces. Bastille Day 2017 military parade in Paris The 2016 parade marked a massive increase in the number of participants, with 5,800 taking part in the march past itself. Personnel from the French Prisons Service Directorate of the Ministry of Justice were included. Participating units represented French military and police actions within France and overseas, partly as a result of the November 2015 Paris attacks. As a tribute to casualties amongst security and military forces, the Patrouille de France flew over the dais in a silhouette of the Effel Tower, while a 4,000 strong children's choir, dressed in the national colours, sang the national anthem alongside the French Army Chorus. Increased anti-terror efforts were marked by the marchpast of armed forces basic training institutions and personnel involved in counter-terrorist operations. In addition, to mark the 2016 national centennial of the events of the Battle of the Somme and the formation of the Lafayette Escadrille, marching in the parade were an ANZAC contingent from both the Australian Defence Force and the New Zealand Defence Force while several aircraft of the United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa - including one in the historical Lafayette Squadron colours - joined the flypast. United States President Donald Trump attended the 2017 parade as the foreign guest for that year, marking the centennial since the United States entry into the First World War. The parade for that year had an estimated 6,500 personnel marching in the march past proper alone, while United States Armed Forces (United States Army Europe, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Naval Forces Europe, United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa) delegations (with a combined total of 2,100 personnel) were expected to take part in the celebrations. That year, President Emmanuel Macron made his holiday address, the first President to do so in the parade grandstand, before the parade began. This was the parade that the reconstituted National Guard took part for the very first time since its reactivation months earlier. A medley of Daft Punk songs was played that year The visit served as an inspiration for a similar event in the United States, first the 2018 Washington Veterans Day Parade (which was cancelled due to cost), and later the \\"Salute to America\\" on 4 July 2019. The 2018 parade marking the centennial year of the conclusion of the First World War was expected to be held with more than 7,500 troops in attendance in the ground column alone, with 480 vehicles in the mobile column, more than last year's parade, in what is one of the major international celebrations of this event, with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong and the Japanese foreign minister, Taro Kono, as the international guests.https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180711/p2g/00m/0dm/008000c Unlike previous years colour guards from the SAFTI Military Institute and the National Defense Academy of Japan took part on behalf of their respective armed services, and the parade was preceded by a joint service contingent (Armed Forces, National Guard, National Gendarmerie, National Police and Customs) representing recent public security and civil relief operations within France and its overseas territories and increased French military operational duties at overseas operations in support of NATO and French speaking countries' armed services. The flypast included M-346 advanced trainer jets from the 150th Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force, the first time ever that an Asian air force had taken part in the parade fly past segment.https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1K40GB The 2019 parade marked a number of anniversaries: the 230th anniversary of the beginning of the French Revolution of 1789, the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings and the 80th of the beginning of the Second World War, the centennial of the historic parade of 1919, the 70th anniversary of the foundation of NATO and the 30th since the raising of the Franco-German Brigade.

The parade capped off with the playing of the National Anthem by the French Army Chorus and La Musique de l'Air preceded by their performances of John Williams' Summon the Heroes and Olympic Fanfare and Theme, both as a reminder of the nation's preparedness in hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics to be held in the capital, while marking the 190th year of the July Revolution of 1830, the golden jubilee anniversary since the passing of President Charles de Gaulle, the 80th anniversary of the formation of the Free French Forces and the establishment of the Order of Liberation, the 75th diamond jubilee since the victory over the Axis Powers and the end of the Second World War and the 60th anniversary of the country's first ever nuclear test. In addition, the French Foreigh Legion Music Band performed as well before the marchpast began. During the pre-parade segment, two French Army tanks from the Armoured Cavalry Arm dating from the Second World War were presented before the dignitaries, in remembrance of de Gaulle's career in the army during that war which began in this branch as a regimental commander before assuming his latter leadership role as leader of the Free French. These tanks, one Char D2 and one Renault R35, were to honor his prior role as commandant of the 507th Tank Regiment. Composition of parade The parade involves around 8,800 soldiers (6,800 on foot, the rest are crew members or cavalrymen), 360 vehicles, 240 horses and more than 80 planes and helicopters.

The branch opened as a single-track line in 1874, but was sufficiently popular that it needed to be upgraded to double-track in 1889. The 1‚Äìin‚Äì36 gradient between Ilfracombe and Mortehoe stations was one of the steepest sections of double track railway line in the country, and was most certainly the fiercest climb from any terminus station in the UK. In the days of steam traction, it was often necessary to double-head departing passenger trains. 'Named' trains such as the Atlantic Coast Express and the Devon Belle both started and terminated at Ilfracombe. Despite nearly a century of bringing much-needed revenue into this remote corner of the county, passenger numbers dropped dramatically in the years following the Second World War due to a massive increase in the number of cars on Britain's roads, and the line finally closed in 1970. Much of the course of the line is still visible today, and sections of it have been converted into public cycleways. A group has been set up to create a heritage railway on the line. History On 20 July 1874 a railway link was opened between Barnstaple and Ilfracombe. The line was originally laid as a single- track light railway, which restricted the type of trains that could use it. Popularity led to expansion, and much of the line was converted to double track between 1889 and 1891. This was a major exercise, requiring the rebuilding of most of the stations, and cutting a second bore for the Slade tunnel. The Southern Railway era started with the Railways Act 1921 and the grouping of the railways. This took effect on 1 January 1923, when the LSWR was absorbed into the new Southern Railway along with its southerly neighbour, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. The GWR formed a group of its own (combining with a large number of smaller lines). Competition to the south, to Portsmouth and Epsom ceased, but critically, competition in the West with the GWR was unaffected.C F Dendy Marshall, History of the Southern Railway, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1982 reprint (revised by Kidner), Michael R Bonavia, The History of the Southern Railway, Unwin Hyman, London, 1987, Peter Semmens, Great Western Railway -- 1: Consolidation 1923 - 1929, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1985, Amongst the ordinary services, the Southern Railway also operated famous titled express trains such as the Atlantic Coast Express (\\"ACE\\"). With a large variety of holiday destinations including Bude, Exmouth, Ilfracombe, Padstow, Plymouth, Seaton, Sidmouth and Torrington, the 11am \\"ACE\\" from Waterloo, as the Atlantic Coast Express became known, was the most multi-portioned train in the UK from its introduction in 1926. This was due to sections of the train splitting at selected junctions for onward journey to their final destinations in the West Country. Padstow railway station in Cornwall was the westernmost point of the Southern Railway, and marked the end or beginning of the \\"ACE\\", which was the longest timetabled journey on the network. The line was mentioned as a candidate for closure in the Reshaping of British Railways report (the Beeching cuts), in 1963, but it was not closed by British Railways until 1970. Indeed, steam-hauled passenger services and freight operations ceased on 7 September 1964 (with one special running on 3 October 1965), and the rationalisation of the line began. DMU services began, the Waterloo through services were stopped, and the line was down-graded to single track on 25 November 1967. A return ticket for travel from Exeter St. David's to Ilfracombe, dated 14 July 1969 It was in May 1967 that the Network for Development Plans were issued by Barbara Castle, the then Labour Minister of Transport, following a study. Where lines were at the remunerative end of the scale, such as the main trunk routes and some secondary lines, these would be developed. But those that failed to meet the financial criterion, but served a social need were to be retained and subsidised under the Transport Act 1968. The problem would be for lines that were not in the above-mentioned categories, which could be candidates for closure as they did not form part of the basic railway network. The Ilfracombe line was one of those that fell into this category. It was a line that may well have carried considerable traffic, and perhaps made a small profit, but it did not meet the government's social, economic and commercial criteria for retention. The line was closed on 5 October 1970, the last train being on 3 October. The final train, an 8-car Class 118 DMU, was packed to bursting point. There was an abortive attempt at saving the line in the early 1970s, but the preservation movement was in its infancy and the project was to flounder as it could not raise the required sum to purchase the line outright. This was because BR had valued the line at ¬£410,000 in 1974 and BR was criticised for charging market values for a potential heritage railway that wanted to preserve it. It must be appreciated that the BR board was under instruction from the ministry to fix the highest price possible in an attempt to recoup funds to offset the deficit that the line produced. The last train was formed of a single inspection saloon hauled by a Class 25, 25 063, on Wednesday 26 February 1975. This carried engineers inspecting the condition of the track for possible reinstatement of services. However this was not to be and track lifting commenced in June 1975. The distinctive curved steel girder bridge over the River Taw in Barnstaple was demolished in 1977, adding a significant cost to any future reopening scheme.

Mortehoe & Woolacombe station, originally named just Mortehoe, was over a mile away from either Woolacombe or Mortehoe, the villages being reached by steep twisty roads from the station. It was also the nearest station for Lee Bay, although the route to that village was even more steep and twisty. The bridge at the north end of the station was the summit of the line. Several sidings were provided for the stabling of banking locomotives, vital for assisting trains up the steep gradients to the station from Ilfracombe (1-in-36) or Braunton (1-in-40). Until about 2008, the station was still largely intact. The main station building, signal box and platforms were still extant, and some of the original concrete lampposts still in place. Since then, the site has been sold and partially redeveloped for housing, although the original station building and signal box have been incorporated in the structures. 'Once Upon a Time' Mortehoe station building, during its 'Once Upon a Time' era (2003) For a number of years the station was the site of a young children's theme park called Once Upon a Time, which was operated by the owners of Watermouth Castle. The station site is in a prominent position on the main road leading to Woolacombe. From outside the site could be seen four (BR Mk 1) carriages (retired from the Dart Valley Railway) sited between the platforms, while scattered around the grounds were a number of '12 ton' van bodies used for storage or housing attractions. (Several of these were of the BR type 'VANWIDE', their double sliding doors being particularly useful for the purpose.) The business closed at the end of the 2005 season. The site was sold in 2006, and was earmarked for re-development as affordable rural housing. By August 2007, all of the external amusement rides and constructions had been auctioned off or demolished, leaving just the main buildings and platforms intact. =Ilfracombe= *The terminus included an engine shed, turntable, goods yard and many sidings to cope with stabling the lengthy passenger trains used on summer Saturdays. *The site is now the location of the Pall Europe factory.

Other lines had steep banks too. The now closed Folkestone Harbour branch was at 1 in 30. The famous Lickey Incline, between Bromsgrove and Blackwell on the Gloucester to Birmingham line, is now the steepest sustained adhesion-worked gradient on British railways, with a northbound climb of 1 in 37¬æ for two miles. In steam days, all except the lightest trains required the services of a banker; however, since dieselisation, this is no longer necessary, except for certain freight services. Rather nearer are the Dainton Banks ‚Äì a 4-mile stretch of the GWR main line between Newton Abbot and Totnes. This section was designed for atmospheric propulsion, rather than steam haulage, and consequently has curves and gradients that would not be dreamed of for a loco- hauled line. The westbound ascent to Dainton Tunnel includes gradients between 1 in 57 and 1 in 36 over a two-mile stretch. Eastbound is slightly easier, comprising, in the space of one mile, gradients of 1 in 55 to 1 in 37. Nevertheless, The Mortehoe banks were much harsher. Northbound there was a 3¬Ω mile continuous climb of 1 in 41, from Heddon Mill Crossing to Mortehoe. While southbound, from Ilfracombe to Mortehoe, the climb was 1 in 36 for 2¬Ω miles, with severe S-curves past Lower Slade making the journey even harder. Banking engines were kept at Braunton and Ilfracombe, to assist when required. Mortehoe station provided a number of sidings for stabling the banking engines after assisting with the climb. Locomotives The severe gradients and sharp curves of the line always limited choice to the smallest engines in the fleet. The original motive power was provided by a class of small 0-6-0 tender locos that later became known as the Ilfracombe Goods (see below). LSWR \\"Jubilee\\" Class A12 0-4-2s replaced the Ilfracombe Goods engines on passenger work, and were themselves replaced by the T1 Class 0-4-4Ts around the turn of the century. From about 1914, LSWR Class M7 0-4-4Ts were commonly used. After the Grouping, the Southern Railway introduced the new Maunsell N class 2-6-0s, in 1925. These were used for services to Exeter and beyond until the arrival of the 'light pacifics' in 1945. The Bulleid SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes of 'Light Pacific' were the largest engines to visit Ilfracombe, and were the preferred choice for the Waterloo services and the Devon Belle. In later years, despite the removal of their 'air-smoothed' boiler casings, the rebuilt examples of these engines would not have been seen, as they were too heavy to use the line. As may be inferred from the name, the West Country locos were named after places in south-west England to which the Southern Railway ran. Enthusiasts always delighted in trying to take pictures of these engines at their 'home town'; and they had many opportunities on the Ilfracombe branch, since there were locos named: Woolacombe, Mortehoe, Barnstaple, Ilfracombe and Braunton. Following Nationalisation, many more through trains were timetabled from Taunton, leading to an increase in the number of ex-GWR locos that visited the branch. Ideally suited to the work were the 43xx class 'Moguls' (2-6-0 tender locos) and the 2251 class 'Colletts' (0-6-0 tender locos). In September 1964, all steam haulage was withdrawn from the line, and most services were thereafter provided by diesel multiple units. However, some long-distance trains still operated, and these were usually loco-hauled. In later years many different diesel-hydraulic classes appeared on the line, including Baby Warships, Hymeks, and Warships. A pair of Class 33 (Cromptons) were also noted on the line, including 33 048 (now preserved on the West Somerset Railway), on 30 August 1970 with the West Sussex Railway Touring Trust 'Chartex Special'. The last train was hauled by a Class 25: 25 063 on Wednesday, 26 February 1975. =The \\"Ilfracombe Goods\\" locomotives= In 1873, three locomotives were ordered by William George Beattie - locomotive engineer for the London and South Western Railway - for the opening of the Ilfracombe line in its original, lightly-laid form. The LSWR 282 class was an 0-6-0 mixed traffic tender locomotive designed and built by Beyer Peacock. They were sufficiently useful that the order was extended to five locomotives in 1874, with a sixth for the Sidmouth Railway in 1875. Two further locomotives were built in 1880, bringing the class total to eight. When the branch lines for which they were originally designed were upgraded in the 1890s, there was no suitable work for the locomotives so all members of the class were moved away to London and Bournemouth. Two locomotives were scrapped in 1905, but the remainder were sold to various railways operated by Colonel Stephens, and continued in use into the 1930s, the last being scrapped in 1939. Also see Locomotives of the Southern Railway. Services The 'N'-class locomotives were limited to fifteen loaded wagons over the Mortehoe bank, however if there were more than eleven trucks, the train was required to have two manned brake vans. A year after the end of regular steam operations, the Southern Counties Touring Society ran the \\"Exeter Flyer\\", a special train on 3 October 1965 (hauled by BR Standard Class 4MT 2-6-4T no 80043). The introduction of a full DMU service in September 1964 resulted in through workings from Exmouth, Sidmouth, Honiton and Salisbury, but direct Waterloo services were discontinued. Walking the line today A view from a railway tunnel on the way toward Ilfracombe A reminder of Braunton's railway; Rails left in the road at a level crossing in Braunton Braunton station was the building on the right, the line passed between the tree and the Pelican crossing The trackbed between Mortehoe Station and Ilfracombe has been restored as the Devon Coast to Coast Cycle Route (rail trail) and forms part of the Tarka Trail. It is possible to walk or cycle from the north road bridge parapet by Woolacombe & Mortehoe Station, down the long descent towards Ilfracombe, passing the Slade reservoirs and going through one of the twin-bore tunnels south of Ilfracombe station. The former line is surrounded by The Cairn ‚Äì heathland planted with trees during the 1960s and transformed into a Local Nature Reserve. South of Woolacombe, it is easy to follow the course of the line by car, as the trackbed closely follows the A361 road for much of the route between Barnstaple and Mullacott Cross (just outside Woolacombe/Ilfracombe). Ilfracombe Museum contains many photographs and relics from the line, including a gradient post and one of the concrete station name boards from Ilfracombe Station (both visible outside the building). Preservation Members of a group on the social networking site Facebook entitled \\"Reversing Beeching - the Ilfracombe Line\\" first mooted the idea of forming a real-world preservation society. On 22 March 2015 members of the group held their first meeting and agreed to apply for charity status to help forward the project's aims. The Combe Rail group on Facebook was launched the following day and a website followed soon afterwards. On 23 October 2015 Combe Rail obtained Registered Charity status with the intention of establishing a heritage railway on the trackbed of the Ilfracombe-Barnstaple line as well as lobbying for a full reopening in the future. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). p.42 See also * Southern Railway routes west of Salisbury * Other local railway attractions:  Bideford and Instow Railway  Lynton and Barnstaple Railway  Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway  Dartmoor Railway References  * * Further reading * * External links * * Barnstaple to Ilfracombe Branch Line - Comprehensive 'then-and-now' photo guide of the line, with OS maps. * Further details of the stations, including maps and grid references. * The Ilfracombe Goods locomotive - article with pictures (from the K&ESR;'s 'Colonel Stephens Museum' website)] * Pictures of the final train inspecting the line * Barnstaple to Ilfracombe Railway 1874-1970, Explore Braunton project, Undated.

Streatham-Croydon currently play in Surrey 4. The club's teams play in cardinal shirts, white shorts and cardinal and white hooped socks.  History  Streatham's heyday was arguably during the late 1960s, and 70s, when 9 senior teams and 4 Colts teams were active, combined with an extensive fixture list against top clubs such as Richmond, Bath, Sale, Saracens, London Welsh, London Irish and others. The professional era and the impact of the new RFU Courage League structure through the late 1980s, and 90s led to a decline in the size of the Club as greater attention was paid to the needs of the 1st XV, and Streatham's membership struggle coincided with its drop down the National and then London leagues. Streatham run three senior men's teams and a senior ladies' XV during the season, as well as a Mini and Junior rugby section, and own a private ground in Thornton Heath (close to the original pitches on Streatham Common), comprising two pitches (one floodlit) and a large clubhouse and grandstand, along with several squash courts, which are all in the process of refurbishment and renovation. In the club's 140th season the Surrey 4 league title was won following only one defeat and the club were promoted to Surrey 3. As part of the 140th season, a fixture known as 'The Skull' was revived, 20 years after it was last contested. The fixture sees all Streatham-Croydon's teams play against teams from Esher RFC with the club that wins the most matches winning the trophy. The trophy is a human skull set between a pair of rugby goalposts. In the 1960s, and 70s this would have been contested by 12 teams from each club, but now Streatham's team play against Esher's similarly ranked amateur teams. The Streatham club was featured in a book titled \\"London's Oldest Rugby Clubs\\" by Dick Tyson, published in May 2008. Notable players John Sharland of Streatham toured with the 1904 British Lions to Australia and New Zealand, playing in 7 matches. W.V. Butcher, capped seven times for England between 1903-05, also playing cricket for Surrey, played for the Streatham club. England prop, and later RFU committee man, Jeff Probyn played at Streatham for a number of seasons in the late 1970s before moving to Wasps and gaining his first England cap. Super League player Will Sharp, played for the 1st XV, before signing his first professional contract with Harlequins RL in 2007. Celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson played for the club's Colts side from 1969‚Äì71 before touring France to learn his trade. Former Prime Minister James Callaghan played at lock for Streatham in the 1939 season. Peter Horton, Colts and 1st XV, emigrated to Australia and played hooker 19 times for Australia between 1974 and 1979, gaining his first cap against New Zealand and his last one against Argentina. * Jeff Probyn * Maurice Colclough * Will Sharp * Antony Worrall Thompson * James Callaghan * Lamont Bryan  Club honours  *Surrey Cup winners (6): 1894, 1895, 1896, 1903, 1974, 1975 *Surrey 4 champions: 2010-11 *Surrey 3 champions (2): 2011-12, 2015‚Äì16 *Surrey Bowl winners: 2012 Notes  References  External links *Official Streatham Rugby website *A History of Streatham Rugby *Streatham featured in 'London's Oldest Rugby Clubs' *BBC News article on Will Sharp Category:Rugby clubs established in 1871 Category:Sport in the London Borough of Croydon Category:English rugby union teams Category:Rugby union clubs in London Category:1871 establishments in England ","title":"Streatham-Croydon RFC"},{"id":"6608990","text":"Revolutionary breach of legal continuity is a concept in English constitutional law, which rationalises the historic English behaviour when one King (or regime) was deposed and a de facto ruler was recognised as the new de jure monarch (or republican authority). More generally it is any process, unauthorised by an existing legal order, which results in the creation of a new legal order; whether or not the revolutionary change is brought about by violence. A technical breach of continuity might happen when the former constitutional arrangement is so inefficient that there is not even a practical legal way to amend it. The most recent successful revolutionary breach in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, was the Glorious Revolution of 1688‚Äì1689 which replaced King James II of England and Ireland (King James VII of Scotland) with the joint sovereignty of his son-in-law King William III of England (King William II of Scotland) and daughter Queen Mary II of England (and Scotland). The United States Declaration of Independence is another example, as it had no basis in the previous legal order which had governed the thirteen colonies and represented the start of a new legal order. A few years later the replacement of the Articles of Confederation with the United States Constitution was a technical breach of continuity, which did not result in a civil war only because of the very reason of the breach: the first USA defined by the Articles had a weak central government that therefore had no means to defend itself. There was an attempted revolutionary breach in the whole of Ireland in 1919, when the First D√°il, a gathering of persons elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons in 1918, declared an Irish Republic, without any authority to do so within the terms of the United Kingdom's legal order. The subsequent Anglo-Irish Treaty and steps taken under it gave the Irish Free State legitimacy within the United Kingdom legal order, but they delegitimised it for those who regarded the applicable legal order to be that proclaimed in 1919. When the present constitution of Ireland was adopted the amending formula of the Irish Free State constitution was deliberately not used, despite having the necessary support, so the new constitution would represent a revolutionary breach and derive its legitimacy from purely Irish sources. Similar steps were taken so the Indian people became the source of legitimacy for the republican constitution of India. The republican constitution replaced the one authorised by the United Kingdom at the time of independence, but did not comply with its provisions for amendments. The term has also been applied to regime change following a military coup in Commonwealth of Nations members such as Pakistan and Nigeria.

The technique was developed in South Africa and was published in 1980 by Gordon V. Kass, who had completed a PhD thesis on this topic. CHAID can be used for prediction (in a similar fashion to regression analysis, this version of CHAID being originally known as XAID) as well as classification, and for detection of interaction between variables. CHAID is based on a formal extension of the United States' AID (Automatic Interaction Detection) and THAID (THeta Automatic Interaction Detection) procedures of the 1960s and 1970s, which in turn were extensions of earlier research, including that performed in the UK in the 1950s. In practice, CHAID is often used in the context of direct marketing to select groups of consumers and predict how their responses to some variables affect other variables, although other early applications were in the field of medical and psychiatric research. Like other decision trees, CHAID's advantages are that its output is highly visual and easy to interpret. Because it uses multiway splits by default, it needs rather large sample sizes to work effectively, since with small sample sizes the respondent groups can quickly become too small for reliable analysis. One important advantage of CHAID over alternatives such as multiple regression is that it is non- parametric.

In 1320 Melide obtained from the Archbishop of Santiago, Berenguel de Landoira, the privilege of building up a castle, fortressing the village, and charging taxes. In 1467 \\"os irmandi√±os\\" opposed the Archbishop Alonso II Fonseca and started a series of fights against its power. During this riot the walls of the village were destroyed as well as the castle. After this, the Catholic Monarchs banned the construction of any fortress in the village. During the last few centuries, like many villages in inner Galicia, it has suffered from a vast emigration of its people to Cuba and Argentina up to 1950s, and then to Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and to other cities of Spain such as Barcelona, Bilbao and A Coru√±a. Currently its economy is based on agriculture, meat processing, and, more recently, tourism.

He was a son of the famous diplomat Stasys Lozoraitis (1898‚Äì1983) and brother of Kazys Lozoraitis. Lozoraitis studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome from 1944 to 1948. He worked at the Lithuanian legation to the Holy See in Rome from 1943. In 1970, after death of Stasys Girdvainis, Lozoraitis became the charg√© d‚Äôaffaires in Rome. On November 15, 1987, Lozoraitis succeeded Stasys Baƒçkis as the leader of Lithuania's diplomatic service in exile, the position held by his father until 1983. The diplomatic service, based in Washington, D.C., was representation of interwar independent Lithuania and did not recognize authority of the Lithuanian SSR, a republic of the Soviet Union. In March 1990, Lithuania declared restoration of its independence. On September 6, 1991, following August Putsch in Moscow and international recognition of independent Lithuania, Lozoraitis resigned the diplomatic service in favor of the national government established in Vilnius. In December 1991, he was appointed as the new government's chief diplomat to the United States, where he re-established the embassy. He was a candidate in the Lithuanian presidential election of February 1993, gathering 38.9% of vote and losing to Algirdas Brazauskas. In May 1993, just a few months after the election, Brazauskas recalled Lozoraitis as ambassador to the U.S. despite criticism of politicizing the issue. In late 1993, Lozoraitis was appointed as the ambassador to Italy. Lozoraitis died of kidney failure at Georgetown University Hospital. He was buried in Putnam, Connecticut, in a Lithuanian Roman Catholic cemetery; he was reburied in Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery in Kaunas in 1999. The same year he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis. Documentary Vilties prezidentas (The President of Hope) was produced by Vytautas V. Landsbergis in 1996.

In digital signal processing, it is a measure of how quickly the spectrum of an audio sound tails off towards the high frequencies, calculated using a linear regression.G. Peeters, A large set of audio features for sound description, tech. rep., IRCAM, 2004. Illustration of the spectral slope Spectral slope in astrophysics and planetary science The visible and infrared spectrum of the reflected sunlight is used to infer physical and chemical properties of the surface of a body. Some objects are brighter (reflect more) in longer wavelengths (red). Consequently, in visible light they will appear redder than objects showing no dependence of reflectance on the wavelength. The diagram illustrates three slopes: *a red slope, the reflectance is increasing with the wavelengths *flat spectrum (in black) *And a blue slope, the reflectance actually diminishing with the wavelengths The slope (spectral gradient) is defined as: :S = \\\\frac{R_{F_1}-R_{F_0}}{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_0} :where R_{F_0}, R_{F_1} is the reflectance measured with filters F0, F1 having the central wavelengths Œª0 and Œª1, respectively. The slope is typically expressed in percentage increase of reflectance (i.e. reflexivity) per unit of wavelength: %/100 nm (or % /1000 √Ö) The slope is mostly used in near infrared part of the spectrum while colour indices are commonly used in the visible part of the spectrum. The trans-Neptunian object Sedna is a typical example of a body showing a steep red slope (20%/100 nm) while Orcus' spectrum appears flat in near infra-red. Spectral slope in audio The spectral \\"slope\\" of many natural audio signals (their tendency to have less energy at high frequencies) has been known for many years,D. B. Fry, The Physics of Speech, Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics, Cambridge University Press, 1996. and the fact that this slope is related to the nature of the sound source. One way to quantify this is by applying linear regression to the Fourier magnitude spectrum of the signal, which produces a single number indicating the slope of the line-of- best-fit through the spectral data. Alternative ways to characterise a sound signal's distribution of energy vs. frequency include spectral rolloff, spectral centroid.  Animals that can sense spectral slope  The dung beetle can see the spectral gradient of the sky and polarised light, and they used this to navigate. Desert ants Cataglyphis use the polarization and spectral skylight gradients to navigate.

The conflicts between the Uasin Gishu/Masai and Kwavi form much of the literature of what are now known as the Iloikop wars. Etymology Krapf's (1854) account on the Kwavi was the earliest and for a long time influenced accounts about the Kwavi community. On their name, he states; Later writers, writing a few decades later by which point the community had collapsed seemed to indicate that Krapf's designation was not quite accurate. None provided an alternative however. Johnston writing in 1886 for instance, noted that \\"'Kwavi' is supposed to be a corrupted version of 'El-oigob'\\"(i.e. Loikop). He also noted that the term Loikop at the time implied settled residence. In another account (1902) he states \\"...'Kwavi',a name that no Masai can recognise or explain, but which has been perpetuated owing to its adoption by Krapf\\". Origins Krapf (1860) recorded a reference to the Kwavi in Wanyika mythology. According to the myth, 'the Galla, Wakamba and Wakuafi had one common father whose eldest son was called Galla'. Galla is said to have raided another community's cattle upon which his brothers Mkamba and Mkuafi asked for a share of the booty but were refused by their brother Galla. Mkuafi is said to have then raided Galla following which he in turn was robbed by his brother Mkamba and vice versa. From that time arose deadly enmity between the brothers which has had no end. Territory Krapf (1854) recorded that; Krapf states further on that \\"regarding Oldoinio eibor it is necessary to remark that by this term is meant the Kir√©nia or Endurkenia, or simply Kenia, as the Wakamba call it...\\" Peoples Ludwig Krapf (1854) recorded accounts of the Eng√°nglima from LemƒÅsƒõgn«ít whose father was \\"Engobore, an Mkuafi of the tribe Eng√°nglima\\" who had \\"married a woman in the Interior near Oldoinio eib≈èr (white mountain)\\" by whom he got his son, LemƒÅsƒõgn«ít. Krapf notes that Engobore resolved to reside at a place called Muasuni which was situated on the upper course of the Pangani river in the vicinity of the kingdom of Usambara when he returned from the interior. Krapf states that \\"the reason which had induced Engobore to join the nomadic settlement of the Wakuafi tribe Barrabuyu...was because his own tribe Eng√°nglima had during his stay in the interior been nearly annihilated by the wild Masai\\". His account of his informant alludes to a corporate identity that he refers to as 'Wakuafi' which had within it at least two sections, that he refers to as Eng√°nglima and Barrabuyu. =Enganglima= Krapf noted that the Enganglima territory; Joseph Thomson wrote of the 'Wa-kwafi' and their territory which by his description is roughly contiguous with Eng√°nglima territory as recorded by Krapf. Thomson stated that; Way of life Writing in the mid-19 century, Krapf detailed a way of life that he noted was common to the 'Wakuafi' and the 'Masai'. =Residence= When the Kwavi and Masai settled at a place for a period of time, they built a large town known as Orlmamara. A smaller town was known as Engany, and a settlement that promised to be important and was large was styled Enganassa. These settlements consisted of huts, covered with cow-hide or grass and were surrounded by thorn hedges and ditches for protection against enemy attack. =Subsistence= Krapf noted that the Kwavi were nomadic, settling for months at a time when they found pasture and water. They lived entirely on milk, butter, honey and the meat of black cattle, goats, sheep, and game. The Kwavi supplemented their herds by raiding other communities for cattle based on a mythological belief that all cattle on earth belonged to them (and Masai) by divine gift. A notable food belief held by the Kwavi was that nourishment provided by cereals enfeebles and was thus only suited to the tribes of the mountains in their territories. The opposite was held to be true, that a diet of meat and milk gives strength and courage and were thus the only proper food for the Kwavi. =Warfare= The weapons of the Kwavi and Maasai consisted of a spear, a large oblong shield, and a club that was round and thick at the top. The latter was used with great precision and to devastating effect at a distance of fifty to seventy paces and it was this weapon above all that struck fear in East African communities, 'the Suahili with their muskets not excepted'. The fighting force was composed of all Kwavi men roughly between the ages of twenty and twenty five. They were known as Elmoran. History Writing in 1854, Krapf portrays a previously powerful community that was under significant Maasai pressure, accounts from later writers would show that the Kwavi community was collapsing under Maasai attacks at the time Krapf was writing about them. Krapf notes that the Kwavi had previously been \\"the terror of the agricultural tribes of Jagga, Ukamabani, Teita, Usambara and on the sea-coast\\". c.1830 misfortunes Thomson, on his journey through Masai land in 1883, wrote of a series of misfortunes that befell and seriously enfeebled the Kwavi people. The 'Kisongo' referred to here by Thomson being the Wa-hehe, who according to Johnston (1902), \\"had been virilised by a slight intermixture of Zulu blood\\". Maasai - Kwavi war Diaspora Thomson in his account notes that the Kwavi were \\"not all scattered thus, however\\". He notes that two large divisions of the Kwavi kept together, one cutting through Kikuyu and settling in 'Lykipia' while the other crossed the Rift to settle in Uasin Gishu. He further records that \\"In both districts they found superb grazing-grounds and plenty of elbow-room, and there for a time they remained quietly, and increased rapidly in numbers\\". * Laikipiak people * Uasin Gishu people References Category:Tribes of Africa ","title":"Kwavi people"},{"id":"6609195","text":"The Dartry Mountains ()Dartry Mountains.
