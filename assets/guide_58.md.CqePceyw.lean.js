She won a citywide at- large election in the Philadelphia City Council as a member of the Working Families Party (WFP) on November 5, 2019. The Council has seven at-large seats that go to the highest overall vote-getters, two seats are reserved for a minority party. Brooks's election is the first time a representative of a minor party won a seat on the council since the creation of the modern version of City Council in 1919. Early life and education Brooks was raised in Nicetown, Philadelphia. She studied at Community College of Philadelphia and worked as a nursing assistant. She later received a Bachelors of Science in therapeutic recreation from Temple University, and an MBA in management from Eastern University. Career Brooks worked with children with disabilities at Easter Seals for 17 years. Due to budget cuts, she was terminated, but remained on the school advisory council of her children's school, and became a neighborhood and educational activist. She also worked with the Parents United for Public Education and the Our City Our Schools coalitions, is on the Steering Committee of 215 People's Alliance, and founded Stand Up Nicetown, a group committed to ending gun violence. For this activism, she was placed on Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney's nominating committee for the new Board of Education. Brooks and Nicolas O'Rourke, a pastor, worked with the Pennsylvania chapter of the WFP to fundraise and organize a get out the vote campaign for the Council race. Due to longstanding tradition, Brooks, O'Rourke, and the WFP activists faced resistance from not only the Republican Party, but also the Philadelphia Democratic establishment, as many expected the remaining two at- large seats to continue to go to Republicans. Philadelphia's seven at-large council seats are determined by limited voting, where voters casting five equally-weighted ballots for five candidates, and the overall top-five finishers (recently presumed to always be Democrats) are joined by the top two vote-getters from a minority party (recently always the Republican party), regardless of actual finish placement as per the Home Rule Charter of 1951. Thus, for the WFP candidates, some Democratic-leaning voters would have to limit their ballots to only three Democrats to cast their votes for Brooks and O'Rourke, which rankled Democratic party leaders who saw this as an opportunity for the Republicans to gain more than the two seats allotted. Bob Brady, former United States Representative and Chair of the Democratic City Committee, called for committee members and ward leaders who campaigned for non-Democrats to be expelled from the party. Brooks was endorsed by Council At-Large member Helen Gym, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, Pennsylvania State Representatives Chris Rabb, Elizabeth Fiedler, Malcolm Kenyatta, Movita Johnson-Harrell, Brian Sims, Pennsylvania State Senator Art Haywood, and Massachusetts US Senator Elizabeth Warren. Brooks was also endorsed by the Pennsylvania chapter of Make the Road, and the Philadelphia chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America, UNITE HERE, and Sunrise Movement. Brooks and her campaign raised more money for a third-party candidate in a Philadelphia City-wide election than any previous candidate. She relied on small dollar donations as approximately two thirds of her donations were for $50 or less. In the November 5, 2019, election, Brooks came in 6th overall in the at-large race, with 55,599 votes, almost 6,000 more than 7th place finisher and top Republican vote-getter, incumbent David Oh, and over 11,000 votes ahead of 8th place Republican vote-getter, Al Taubenberger, ensuring her a place on the Council. =Political positions= Brooks supports creating and preserving more affordable housing and expanding rent control, and is supportive of a Green New Deal for Philadelphia.

Active since 2018, he specializes on criticism of sociocultural concepts like feminism, gender studies and political correctness. Biography UTBH started his YouTube career in early 2018. Before that, he had worked as a graphic designer before moving to Canada, where he studied for two years before returning to Spain. It was there where he got the idea to open a YouTube channel, in the style of social critics like H3h3Productions, Jordan Peterson and Some Black Guy, who inspired his own nickname. His first video, which addressed the consequences of the Me Too movement, was uploaded to YouTube on 2 February 2018. He introduced then his characteristic visual style, in which he monologues to the camera while wearing a white lycra mask (nicknamed by himself his \\"human condom\\" and based on Batman's attire), a black hoodie and plastic sunglasses. As he explained later, he chose this appearance not only to hide his identity and stand out, but also to divest himself of his individuality and to represent ironically the \\"white heterosexual\\" collective in the gender perspective's own terms. The mentioned video attracted a great deal of views and subscribers, which only increased with his next productions, reaching 140 000 in only seven months and allowing him to open a Patreon account. His early videos also established his channel's theme, which orbits around building criticism of modern feminism through research material, as well as verbalizing \\"that which many think but don't dare to say.\\" UTBH attributed his success to his addressment of those topics, which didn't impede him from attracting controversy from related circles, to the point of receiving death threats with some frequency. Despite the many political affiliations media has speculated about him, he declared himself as a YouTuber for both left and right-wing politics. His channel's impact also promoved the presence of other Spanish video producers with the same thematic, among them the YouTuber and PhD in science Xeno Shenlong. In May 2019, UTBH became mediatic after his participation in the Free Market Road Show in Castell√≥n was subjected to an escrache. The incident's authorship fell on feminist association Subversives, which had previously called to boycott the act on the saying it was \\"fascist and misogynist,\\" and whose members had to be driven outside by the National Police Corps. Some days later, the YouTuber uploaded a video about the incident to deflect the accusations. The same month, UTBH released his first book, Prohibir la manzana y encontrar la serpiente, written along with fellow YouTuber Leyre Khyal.

The opening gets its name from White omitting their defensive left gold development (...G-32) and instead opting for an early bishop trade in order to initiate a quick attack line with their bishop in hand. The missing defensive gold leaves White lacking a 'guard.' The opening is considered speculative since it is thought to favor Black and is not used by professional shogi players. However, it is tactical and quickly enters the endgame consequently being challenging to defend against successfully by some amateur players. Development 1.P-76 P-34 2.P-26 P-84 3.P-25 P-85. The branch of this variation starts after both players advance their rook pawns and open their bishop diagonals. 4.G-78. Black plays the defensive move by developing their left gold to the seventh file so that it protects the 87 and 88 squares. The position at this point is Double Wing Attack opening (where both players exchange their rook pawns off the board) with mutually open bishop diagonals (see: Double Wing Attack¬ßOpen bishop diagonal variation), which most commonly develops into a Side Pawn Capture opening after Black takes White's side pawn. However, these openings progress as usual only when White mirrors Black's defensive gold move with 4...G-32, which is the joseki move. In contrast, in the No Guard opening, White does not mirror Black's position and instead initiates a rook pawn trade before Black leaving their left gold on its starting square. 4...P-86 5.Px86 Rx86. White exchanges their rook pawn. Usually after the typical 1.P-76 P-34 2.P-26 P-84 3.P-25 P-85 4.G-78 G-32 Side Pawn Capture sequence, it is Black that first exchanges the rook pawn with 5.P-24 Px24 6.Rx24. In No Guard, White is trying to gain the initiative by making the exchange first. And, in order to do so, White does not spend time with the 4...G-32 defense. =‚òó6.P-24= 6.P-24 Px24 7.Rx24. Black follows White in also making the rook pawn exchange. Both players now have two pawns in head each. Black is not required to exchange their rook pawn here. If Black prefers not to play the main No Guard lines, then they can foil White's plans with 6.P*87, which forces White's rook to retreat and closes the eighth file to Black's rook attacks. However, doing this definitely prevents any possibility of playing a usual Side Pawn Capture-like opening for Black putting them into Double Wing opening territory. (See ¬ß‚òó6.P*87 below.) 7...Bx88+ 8.Sx88. Since White has gained tempo by omitting ...G-32, they now make a bishop trade to start the No Guard deviation. Before this bishop exchange, White still had the possibility of playing the standard 7...G-32, which will then transpose to the usual Side Pawn Capture/Double Wing opening (that has the more common order of 1.P-76 P-34 2.P-26 P-84 3.P-25 P-85 4.G-78 G-32 5.P-24 Px24 6.Px24 P-86 7.Px86 Rx86). 8...B*33. White tries to take advantage of Black's vulnerable rook by forking the rook and Black's left silver. Since Black will presumably move their rook in order to prevent its capture, White's bishop aims at the 88 square, which is also being targeted by White's rook. Main line: ‚òó9.Rx21+ 9.Rx21+. The counterattacking capture of White's knight while also promoting the rook is the strongest response for Black. 9...Rx88+. White continues the attack by capturing Black's silver. Black's 88 square only has one defender, so White can recapture with their bishop to break into Black's camp. 10.Gx88 Bx88+. Black recaptures with the defending gold, and White takes it with the bishop. ‚òó9.R-28 9.R-28. In this line, Black retreats the rook back to safety and adds a defender to rank 8, which allows a recapture should White attack the 88 square with ...Bx88+ Gx88 Rx88+ Rx88. 9....P*27.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage insisting that mixed methods fully engage qualitative methodologies into the study. Morse established the major professional and scholarly infrastructure items that support qualitative health research. In 1991, she convened the first international conference on the topic in Edmonton. After organizing three subsequent qualitative health research conferences, she launched the International Institute for Qualitative Methodology (IIQM) at University of Alberta.Givens, L. (2008). ‚ÄúInternational Institute for Qualitative Methodology.‚Äù Sage Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods. https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412963909.n229 Morse founded the first journal in the field, Qualitative Health Research (Sage 1991) and has edited it since its inception. She later founded two additional journals, International Journal of Qualitative Methodology (2001), an open access digital publication that welcomed submissions in any language and provided translation services for them, and Global Qualitative Nursing Research (2014), and served as editor of each. With her departure from Alberta for Utah in 2007, Morse launched an international organization, Global Congress for Qualitative Health Research, which hosts an annual conference.  International Institute of Qualitative Methodology  As founder, director, and later scientific director of the Institute, Morse launched numerous initiatives to aid the development of qualitative methodology. IIQM ran two conferences and a week of workshops each year, attracting thousands of scholars from around the world. In addition to the journals, Qual Press was launched to publish original research and produced 11 volumes. It was later distributed by Left Coast Press and now by Routledge. Recognizing the importance of internationalizing the practice of qualitative research, Morse created a network of over 100 corresponding sites in 30 countries. Researchers from corresponding sites came as visiting scholars to Alberta to improve their research skills and Alberta researchers were sent around the world to help teach qualitative methodology in other countries.  Nursing research  Morse‚Äôs main contribution in nursing research relates to understanding and controlling patient falls. She created the Morse Fall Scale, a six point scale to predict a patient‚Äôs risk of falling.Schwendimann, R.; De Geest, S.; Milisen, K.

She was awarded Chevalier of L‚Äôordre des Arts et des Lettres of France in 1990.  Biography  Zuka was born in 1924 in San Francisco to a family of Russian immigrants who came to the United States in 1920s. Her father was an officer in White Russian Army. Zuka received a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from the University of Southern California. In 1948 she went to Paris using the money she received from California gallery grant. Two years later, in 1950, she married political cartoonist Louis Mitelberg and they lived in Paris ever since. They had two sons, Roland and Fran√ßois.  Work  Zuka started with portrait painting in the Los Angeles area when she was a student of the University of Southern California. When she moved to Paris in 1948 first she painted artists and writers in frozen poses, but then she moved to figures from history combining painting and collage in narrative works. Influenced by her husband she became interested in historical imagery and did her first series on the American Revolution in 1970s. More prominent are Zuka's depictions of the French Revolution presented in the exhibition ‚ÄúThe French Revolution through American Eyes,\\" 1988. It was a result of her six years‚Äô research of the French literature for period portraits and other appropriate images to reconstruct people and events. Zuka's paintings of the French Revolution are of great significance as they position women as active participants of these historical events. The most recent subjects of Zuka's paintings were birds, cows and nature. She became familiar with these subjects at her country house in Burgundy and now Zuka's cows exist in many formats ranging from large-scale oil paintings to postcards.

It is not to be confused with Naas's Roman Catholic church, which is called the Church of Our Lady and Saint David. History St David's Church was built on the site of an earlier Celtic Christian church dedicated to Saint Corban or St Patrick. Following the Norman conquest of Ireland (1169‚Äì75), William Fitzmaurice and the Cambro-Norman barons who settled in the Naas area rebuilt the church and dedicated it Saint David, patron saint of Wales. Up until about 1800 it was the custom in Naas to wear a leek on March 1 in honour of the saint. In 1212 St David's was listed as one of the possessions of the Knights Hospitaller. By 1606, when St David‚Äôs featured in the inquisition of James I, contained three chantries ‚Äì Holy Trinity, St Mary, and St Catherine. The priests were appointed by the burgesses and provost of the town. William Pilsworth was named vicar in 1604. In 1620 the current building was constructed, incorporating much of the old Norman church. By 1767 the steeple was in a ruinous state and was pulled down. Joseph Bourke, 3rd Earl of Mayo decided to replace it but never completed the new tower; a plaque on the inside wall of the tower states ‚ÄúI found a ruin and left a steeple, Mayo 1783‚Ä≥. The bell dates from 1674 and originally hung in the old steeple. The baptismal font is believed to be very old, predating the Norman church. The church was excavated by T. Fanning in 1987‚Äì91, with many medieval tiles found.

They form a separate group from the Clyde cairns which are found along the coast of western Britain. Unlike Clyde cairns, Bargrennan monuments are passage graves, with one or more chambers set into a round cairn. As well as being structurally different, Bargrennan cairns are separated from Clyde cairns by their siting and distribution; they are found in upland, inland areas of Galloway and Ayrshire. Murray suggests that there are around twelve Bargrennan monuments in south-west Scotland. She also notes that as sheep rees are often built into and over these types of cairns, more are likely to have been lost under shepherd's buildings. The type site is White Cairn, Bargrennan. This monument and nearby Cairnderry chambered cairn have been excavated but having been previously robbed out neither have provided material for dating. Both sites show extensive reuse in the Bronze Age, including the addition of a Bronze Age cist in White Cairn. It has been suggested that this may indicate an early Bronze Age date for sites of this type. However, a mid to late Neolthic date has also been suggested.

A subscription school was a type of private school that operated in the 19th century in rural areas of the United States before the rise of common schools, and also in parts of the United Kingdom. The funding model of subscription schools differed from other schools in that rather than funding the school with either tax revenue or fixed tuition, parents paid \\"by the scholar,\\" paying only for the number of days their child actually attended. Because parents did not have to pay when their children were unable to attend, this model was well-suited to pre-industrial rural life in which children were often required to do farm labor for long periods of the year. For this reason, subscription schools were often open only during the winter. \\"Locally organized and informally governed,\\" a subscription school was typically a one-room affair with a single teacher. Subscription schools were not subject to any central control or standardization, in terms of either the teacher's qualifications or the subjects taught. The level of education was generally limited to the primary grades. Typically, prior to establishing a subscription school, the surrounding area would be canvassed to determine whether there were enough parents in the area who were prepared to pay to send their children to the school. Because only those whose parents could afford to pay were able to attend, subscription schools exacerbated rural inequality and illiteracy by depriving the children of the rural poor of any education whatsoever. However, because replacement of subscription schools by common schools entailed a loss of local control, the transition to public schooling was often the subject of bitter political controversy. Subscription schools faced competition not only from public schools, but in some areas also from the elementary departments of seminaries and academies, which typically also provided education up to or beyond the secondary level. In areas where established schools were limited to whites only, the subscription school model was often used by African American or Native American teachers and students. For example, the first known African-American school in St. Louis, Missouri was a subscription school that future Senator Hiram Revels established in 1856. In North Carolina, the first school serving the Lumbee tribe was a subscription school established in 1870. Subscription schools funded and taught by African Americans became widespread in the American South after the Civil War. In Jefferson City, Missouri, Black veterans of the Civil War founded the Lincoln Institute as a subscription school in 1866. Subscription schools for Black students in the South continued well beyond the end of the Reconstruction era. In some parts of the United States such as Oklahoma, subscription schools continued to be established into the early 20th century.

Born to a well-known family, he was the sixth child of Lewis Mayer, a lawyer, and his cousin, Susan Mayer. His uncle and namesake, Charles F. Mayer, was a Maryland state senator and prominent figure in Baltimore. Mayer was privately educated in Baltimore and traveled abroad as a youth, before beginning work for his uncle Frederick Koenig. On December 4th, 1866, Mayer married his cousin, Susan Keim, who was the daughter of Congressman George M. Keim. They had no children. Mayer became president of the Consolidation Coal Company of Maryland in 1877. In 1887, he became a member of the board of directors of B&O;, and in 1889, succeeded Samuel Spencer as its president. Mayer served as president for seven years, playing a key role in the construction of the Baltimore Belt Line. He recruited young engineer Samuel Rea to design the line, and personally chose the Saxony royal blue color that became the signature of the line's premier Royal Blue rail service. Mayer also succeeded in separating the railroad from partial political control by the City of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, convincing them to sell their stock in the company in 1890. However, the railroad suffered from financial issues during his tenure, and Mayer resigned in 1896. He was replaced by the company's general counsel, John K. Cohen.

Her research considers novel therapeutic strategies to improve the lives of people with HIV and to support public health initiatives in East Africa. She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2019.  Early life and education  Havlir was born in Illinois. As a teenager Havlir was a committed speed skater, and by 1974 was the United States national short track champion. Havlir eventually studied biology and chemistry at St. Olaf College and graduated in 1980. Here, instead of speed skating, she took part in cross-country running. She briefly considered becoming an environmental lawyer before taking part in an interim course in medicine. During her undergraduate degree Havlir took part in a study abroad course in Costa Rica on the nutrition habits of the elderly. She moved to the Duke University School of Medicine for her Doctorate of Medicine, which she completed in 1984. At Duke Havlir became interested in infectious diseases. Academic career Havlir served as an internal medicine resident at the UCSF Medical Center when AIDS emerged in the 1980s. She worked in the first San Francisco AIDS ward at San Francisco General Hospital. She completed a fellowship in infection diseases at Case Western Reserve University. At the time, people didn't know the causes of AIDS, or how to treat it. She demonstrated that the antibiotic azithromycin was an effective way to prevent mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections. She went on to show that a cocktail of drugs was the most effective way to suppress the virus. Whilst the HIV cocktail was effective, it was complicated and expensive ‚Äì requiring patients to take nine drugs a day at a cost of $30,000 a year. In the early 1990s Havlir spearheaded early studies using antiretroviral therapy, which led to its widespread usage. To try to simplify the treatment, Havlir unsuccessfully tried to reduce the number of drugs used in the cocktail after the virus started to decrease.  Research  Havlir at the 19th International AIDS Conference in 2012 Havlir has studied new treatments for HIV/AIDS, including Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) which can overcome the ability of HIV to mutate and become resistant. Her research has contributed to turning HIV from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic illness. Working with the World Health Organization, Havlir committed to treating three million HIV/AIDS sufferers by 2005. In 2006 Havlir was appointed Chair of the World Health Organization TB/HIV Working Group, and by 2007 she had achieved the goal of treating three million people. In 2012 Havlir wrote a nine-point plan, the D.C. Declaration, which outlined what was needed to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. She acted as co-chair of the 2012 International AIDS Conference. She co-founded the San Francisco Getting to Zero coalition, which looks to reduce the number of HIV infections and deaths in San Francisco by 90% by 2020. The coalition formed after a patient enquired as to whether various groups (policy makers, providers and people who suffered from HIV/AIDS). The coalition has established testing sites all over the city, expanded access to Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), initiated treatment as soon as a diagnosis is made and ensured continued care. Timely treatment can stop the HIV virus progressing into AIDS, and stop it from damaging other organs. It can also help to reduce HIV transmission. Havlir has exported the successes of the San Francisco AIDS treatment programs to Sub-Saharan Africa. In this capacity she established the UCSF Medical Center Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) project in 2014, which by 2016 had identified and treated 90 % of HIV infections. Havlir has led collaborations between the Makerere University and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. She is leading a National Institutes of Health study involving 320,000 people in Uganda and Kenya that plans to eliminate HIV through community health based approaches. The program was supported by the National Institutes of Health, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the World Bank. The collaboration has negotiated with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost of treatment for patients. She has found that it is beneficial to test for multiple diseases in African clinics, as it reduces stigma and shares the costs. Havlir is the Chief of the HIV/AIDS Division at UCSF School of Medicine.

Pietro Da Ponte, L'opera del Moretto, Brescia 1898, p. 48 In the article written by Fausto Lechi and Gaetano Panazza for the 1939 exhibition La Pittura bresciana del Rinascimento, they write that it \\"is a most gracious, small composition that blends the bright and warm colours and silvery tones which make it very precious. The two most sweet images live in an almost-dreamlike atmosphere made of silvery tones and blue-green lights like seawater\\". Fausto Lechi, Gaetano Panazza, La pittura bresciana del Rinascimento, exhibition catalogue, Bergamo 1939, p. 178 In 1958 Gaetano Panazza called the work \\"a most delicious little panel, despite some heaviness in the cloud surrounds the Holy Spirit. It is one of Moretto's most successful creations, intimately poetic and rich in serene religiosity, silvery and cold in tones tuned and subdued, in which dark pearl predominates. The solution of the double-mullioned window is Lombard, perhaps with some Leonardesque sense, that lets us see the blue landscape in the background\\". Gaetano Panazza, I Civici Musei e la Pinacoteca di Brescia, Bergamo 1958, p. 122 In 1974 Camillo Boselli wrote \\"the Annunciation is a delightful jewel, unique in Morretto's small oeuvre, of which several more or less autograph Madonnas are scattered in public or private collections are the most common examples. These works are not always securely identified as autograph works by Moretto since many of them are probably studio works....

The establishment was originally poor ‚Äîchaumes meant \\"uncultivated land\\" in Old French.

Vincent de Paul briefly served as commander of the abbey from 1610. At this time, the commendatory regime and the war (the first Siege of La Rochelle) already had visible negative consequences. Vicent de Paul resigned from commendatory office in 1616. In 1723, the abbey was mentioned as completely destroyed. According to Janauschek, the abbey had the order number CCCC (400).

He was CEO of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) from 1976 to 1989. Career Palmstierna was born in Lund, Sweden, the son of Hovj√§gm√§stare, Friherre Carl Palmstierna and his wife Anne-Marie (n√©e von Essen), and grew up on the family estate of Maltesholm Castle. His grandmother Ruth von Essen was the youngest daughter of Andr√© Oscar Wallenberg, the founder of Stockholms Enskilda Bank (SEB) (the forerunner of the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB) and Palmstierna's employer for 30 years, and where he was CEO for 13 years. Palmstierna passed studentexamen in Sigtuna in 1953 and graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1957. In 1959, Palmstierna graduated from the Stockholm School of Economics and the year after he was hired by Stockholms Enskilda Bank (SEB). Palmstierna was appointed Deputy Bank Director in 1965 and Bank Director in 1968. Palmstierna was appointed Deputy CEO of Stockholms Enskilda Bank in 1969, and of the Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB) in 1972. He was then appointed CEO of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB in 1976. On 22 July 1989, Svenska Dagbladet published the first in a series of articles, which dealt with the circumstances surrounding the villa attached to his post as CEO of SEB, which Palmstierna had rented from the bank for ten years, and which was to develop into the so-called Palmstierna affair. The affair attracted a lot of attention and became a serial in the media for several months. Upon Palmstierna's entry, as CEO of SEB, the bank had bought his villa in Djursholm and rented it to him for SEK 3,000 per month. At that time, the rental amount was considered extremely advantageous, as it corresponded to the cost of a two-room apartment in the outskirts of Stockholm, which had prompted the Swedish Tax Agency to investigate the arrangement. Then, in an interview with the newspaper, Palmstierna expressed that the rent for the villa was marketable, that is, perfectly normal, escalated the affair. It reached a peak, when a few days later it turned out that the Palmstierna leased a villa in the same area for a monthly rent of SEK 30,000. On 21 September 1989, the police conducted a house search at the Palmstierna's office. His confidence as a banker was considered to be exhausted and he received no support or defense from the Wallenberg family or the bank's board, which led him to submit his resignation application on 14 November 1989.Svenska Dagbladet, 1989-07-22 - 1989-08-08.Svenska Dagbladet, 1989-11-16 - 1989-11-19. Palmstierna felt betrayed by the Wallenberg family in connection with the affair, the heir Peter Wallenberg Sr. in particular. In his outspoken memoirs from 2010, he speculates whether this was due to conflicts they had within the company group. Palmstierna himself had stood closest to the father Marcus Wallenberg Jr., with whom his son Peter had a complicated relationship with. In the early 1990s, Bj√∂rn Wahlstr√∂m had been assigned the task of saving the state-owned Nordbanken. Wahlstr√∂m became chairman, Palmstierna deputy. They brought in Hans Dalborg as CEO and together they made a cleaning effort that earned the taxpayers several billions. Palmstierna were crucial to the bank's metamorphosis. He was the one with the most banking experience. As chairman between 1992 and 2000, he then co-founded the mergers in Norway, Denmark and Finland, which became today's Nordea, the largest bank in the Nordic countries. He was a board deputy of AB Nordstr√∂ms linbanor and chairman of the board of Loomis AB (from 2007), Linder√∂ds√•sens Kraft AB, Piren AB, Catena, Siemens-Elema AB, VBB AB and some of its subsidiaries. Palmstierna was a board member of F√∂retagskapital AB, Goodyear Svenska AB, Rank Xerox AB, Orkla ind A/S, AB Electrolux, Sal√©ninvest AB, AB Nym√∂lla, Kopparfors AB, Arvid Nordqvist HAB, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB, A Johnson & Co HAB, NCC AB, Tetra Laval, ICB Shipping, Avesta Sheffield, Burenstam & Partners AB, Maltesholms F√∂rvaltnings AB, Industrial and Financial Systems (IFS) AB, Sk√•neskogens Utvecklings AB, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB) and some of SEB's foreign subsidiaries. He was also treasurer of the Stockholm School of Economics Association (Handelsh√∂gskolef√∂reningen) and a member of the Stockholm School of Economics Board of Directors (Handelsh√∂gskolan i Stockholms direktion). Palmstierna was chairman of the German-Swedish Chamber of Commerce. Personal life Palmstierna was married five times. In 1960, he married Anna Hamilton (born 1935). In 1966, he married Catharina von Knorring, the daughter of Holger von Knorring and Jeanne-Marie von Troil. In 1981, he married Caroline Hebbe (born 1930). In 1989, he married Annika Wallenberg, the daughter of Stig Jansson and Karin (n√©e MasOlle). He met his fifth and last wife, Hanne, in the late 1970s. They decided to separate from their partners to live together, but changed their minds shortly thereafter and did not see each other for 13 years, before they took up the relationship again. At the age of 32, in 1966, Palmstierna took over the family estate of Maltesholm Castle outside Kristianstad. His son Niclas took over the castle after his father's death.

History  = Foundation = The party was registered in 1999 with the same name as the National Front of Catalonia, which had dissolved in 1990. In 2013 Jordi Casacubera i P√©rez, Pere Soler i Montoliu, Miquel √Ängel Rodr√≠guez i Fern√†ndez and Mois√®s Font i Casademont publicly launched the party. Jordi Casacuberta had been a member of the National Front of Catalonia, Catalan State, Republican Left of Catalonia, and Reagrupament. Pere Soler and Miquel √Ängel Rodr√≠guez had been members of the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and Mois√®s Font had been councilor of Platform for Catalonia in Olot and territorial president of PxC in Girona. Former members of the original FNC made a statement saying that when they had dissolved the FNC in 1990, they had approved in the last General Assembly that no-one would use the name in future, and that the ideology defended by the new FNC was different from the progressivism that the original FNC stood for. On June 27, 2014, Jordi Casacuberta i Pere Soler re-introduced the party with the name of National Democratic Bloc in Girona. They were defined as social conservatives and republicans. They wanted to present tenths of lists for the 2015 local elections, but finally they didn't do so. The party announced they would not participate in Catalan regional elections before independence in order to avoid dividing the vote. = 2019 local elections = In the 2019 local elections, the party presented a list in Ripoll, with the same name as the National Front of Catalonia, dissolved in 1990. The first on the list was S√≠lvia Orriols Serra and the second candidate was Fina Guix, who had been a councilor for Converg√®ncia i Uni√≥ in the previous legislature. Alternative for Ripoll, the Republican Left of Catalonia, Together for Catalonia and the Socialists' Party of Catalonia pledged not to negotiate or work with the other two candidates from the FNC and Som Catalans, because they believed they were racist. The FNC denied this allegation. The party obtained 503 votes (9.44%) and S√≠lvia Orriols Serra was elected as a councilor. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, S√≠lvia Orriols left the FNC because of differences with the party on how to ¬´face the serious national situation and the problem of immigration¬ª. As she continued to be councilor, the FNC was left without representation.

It was developed by Beam Software and published by Melbourne House. It was released in Europe in 1986, for Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. Gameplay Judge Dredd is a platform shoot 'em up game set in the fictional Mega-City One. Playing as Judge Dredd, the player's goal is to apprehend or kill criminals known as \\"perps.\\" The player begins with a map that highlights various crimes occurring throughout the city. After choosing a crime location, the player goes there to stop the perp. The player has three options for dealing with perps: \\"Halt\\", in which Judge Dredd orders the perp to stop; \\"Warn\\", in which he fires a warning shot; and \\"Kill\\", in which he chooses to shoot and kill the perp. The player's weapon is Judge Dredd's Lawgiver gun, which can shoot six different bullet types. A panel at the bottom of the screen indicates the type of crime, the perp's whereabouts, and weapon information such as the selected gun and the amount of ammunition. If more than eight crimes are occurring throughout the city, the player loses. Aside from perps, other enemies throughout the game include robot dogs. The ZX Spectrum version does not feature music. Development and release Around 1984, a Judge Dredd video game was in development by Games Workshop. When the company stopped producing software, the Australia-based Melbourne House took over the project several months later. Melbourne House published the game, which was developed by Beam Software. It was released in Europe in 1986, for Commodore 64 (C64). By early 1987, it had also been released for the ZX Spectrum. It was the first Judge Dredd video game. Ricochet published a budget re-release of the C64 version in 1988. Reception Some critics perceived the game as a disappointment considering the Judge Dredd licence, although the ZX Spectrum version was generally well received. Mike Pattenden of Commodore User considered the gameplay repetitive and wrote that the game's major problem \\"is that you run around pretty aimlessly. The crimes and their perps are rather unexciting. An arson attack for example never seems to be accompanied by any actual evidence of fire or smoke whatsoever.\\" ZX Computing wrote that the game \\"captures the atmosphere of crime fighting in the future although it has strayed from the comic character which will no doubt annoy the connoisseurs. The rest of us will love it.\\" Jim Douglas of Sinclair User praised the game as a good use of the Judge Dredd licence. Mike Roberts of Computer Gamer had mixed feelings, writing that the game suffered from having \\"a nodding deference to Judge Dredd which restricted the gameplay slightly,\\" but that it also failed by \\"not being accurate enough to the character.\\" Roberts also opined that the game felt rushed and unfinished. The graphics received a mixed reception, with reviewers for Crash and Zzap!64 writing negatively. Phil South of Your Sinclair praised the game and its graphics. Pattenden wrote that \\"there's some nice graphics and touches but no absorbing gameplay to go with it.\\" Roberts praised the background graphics. Some reviewers disliked the music used in the C64 version, and Crash was critical of the ZX Spectrum version for its lack of music. Manfred Kleimann, writing for the German magazine Aktueller Software Markt, praised the graphics and sound of the C64 version. Graeme Mason of Eurogamer wrote in 2017 that \\"there wasn't much for fans of the comic strip to sink their teeth into, and the game inevitably felt rushed, with jerky controls and a half-arsed attempt to bring comic-book stylings to the screen.\\" References External links * Judge Dredd at MobyGames Category:Judge Dredd Category:Platform games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Superhero video games Category:Video games about police officers Category:Video games based on comics Category:Commodore 64 games Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:1986 video games ","title":"Judge Dredd (1986 video game)"},{"id":"62274060","title":"MMXX (album)"},{"id":"62274068","text":"Deborah Oxley, is a Professor of Social Science History at the University of Oxford.

The concept of autobiografiction was invented by Stephen Reynolds in 1906, and then researched and described in depth by Max Saunders in 2010.  Reynolds' definition  According to Reynolds, autobiografiction is a combination of autobiography, fiction, and essay. For a work to be considered autobiografiction, it must be a \\"record of real spiritual experiences strung on a credible but more or less fictitious autobiographical narrative\\". Reynolds' understanding of spiritual experience is similar to James Joyce's \\"epiphany\\" and Virginia Woolf's \\"moments of being\\" because the triggering event does not need to be extraordinary or uncommon but it must affect a person greatly and touch their soul. Reynolds also said autobiografiction is created when neither formal autobiography nor pure fiction nor an essay can be used to communicate the author's feelings and emotions in a truthful and satisfying way and that it is often published anonymously or at least \\"with some degree of anonymity\\". According to Max Saunders, these criteria were important to Reynolds as a closeted homosexual man who wrote his essay eleven years after Oscar Wilde's trial. Wilde and other queer writers of the time used autobiografictional techniques to write about queer intimacy while concealing it from censors and making it understandable by those who knew what to look for. Reynolds said autobiografictional works should ideally be inspiring for other people and help them by showing readers they could follow the authors' examples of overcoming problems and hardships. According to Reynolds, this property give autobiografictional works an influence that is \\"greater in life than in literature\\".  Saunders' definition  Max Saunders defines autobiografiction as a genre of autobiographical fiction that was developed between the 1870s and the 1930s, and was frequently explored by Modernist writers.. According to Saunders, the commonly used term autobiographical fiction is insufficient to describe the special connection between modernism and autobiography. Reynolds' claim that because autobiografiction is about \\"combining forms; fusing, blurring, or moving between the forms of autobiography, story, diary, preface, and so on\\", it is a meeting point between the facts that all fiction is autobiographical and that all autobiography is fictional and therefore both \\"autobiographical content ... displaced onto a fictionalized narrative form\\", modernist works that use autobiographical form and combination of them can be qualified as autobiografictional. According to Reynolds, another important feature of autobiografiction is that the self of the author is \\"the self as created through role-playing, since its writers are consciously and deliberately shifting into the shapes of other subjectivities, and thus revealing the performance involved in the achievement of any subjectivity\\". Saunders rejects Reynolds' idea that all autobiografictional works should help the readers and give them hope, especially because this criterion was rooted in the zeitgeist of the turn-of-the-century England. Saunders also argues about the inclusion of the essay genre in autobiografiction; he said autobiografiction \\"reads like an essay\\" because it deals with only small a part of the author's life rather than its entirety.  Queer autobiografiction  Saunders' study of autobiografiction demonstrates a link between this form and queerness: In her 2007 work The Formation of 20th Century Queer Autobiography, Georgia Johnston writes about a special type of \\"modernist autobiography as a critique of dominant sexual discourses\\" and its \\"manipulation of the autobiographical genre\\", which is similar to Saunders' concept of \\"playing games with autobiography\\". Johnson analyses diaries, letters, and formal autobiographies of queer modernist writers but she also references fictional works. Johnson said the \\"queer autobiography\\" as a subgenre of autobiography can also be applied to queer autobiografiction as a subgenre of autobiografiction; several factors analysed by Johnson that influence autobiographies would also influence other autobiographical genres, including autobiografiction.

(Translation by Shmuplations. ). In the game, players assume the role of a robot fighting against a multitude of enemies and bosses across six locations on a futuristic science fiction setting. It is notable for marking the debut of Twin Cobra and Hellfire artist K≈çetsu Iwabuchi in the video game industry, serving as its graphic designer, as well as for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. Guardian was considered a financial flop in arcades for Toaplan. As of 2019, the rights to the title is owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other IPs from the defunct studio.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Guardian is a science fiction- themed side-scrolling beat 'em up game reminiscent of Kung-Fu Master, where players assume the role of a robot through six increasingly difficult fictional planets, each with a boss at the end that must be fought before progressing any further as the main objective.Get Star arcade flyer (Taito, JP) The player controls the robot with a four-way joystick and two attack buttons to punch and kick. The joystick is not only used for crouching, but for jumping as well. Punches and kicks are performed from either a standing, crouching or jumping position. Along the way, there are three types of items that appear as flashing crosses: extra energy stock, invincibility and a long- range laser weapon. On occasions, a red orb spawns on the ground and when picked up, increases the robot's punching power up to three times. The game hosts hidden bonus secrets to be found, which are crucial for reaching high- scores to obtain extra lives. The title uses a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will start off at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Running out of energy will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the robot's power to his original state and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. After completing the last stage, the game begins again with the second loop.  Development and release  Guardian's development process and history were recounted between 1990 and 2009 through Japanese publications such as Gamest. (Translation by Gamengai. ). K≈çetsu Iwabuchi designed the game's graphics in his first video game role prior to Twin Cobra and Hellfire. Former Toaplan composer Tatsuya Uemura stated that the title was developed alongside another project intended for the Sega System 1 that was ultimately scrapped. The music was composed by Masahiro Yuge. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Guardian was released only in arcades across Japan and North America on March 1986 by Taito and Kitkorp. On 25 July 2018, an album containing music from the title, as well as from other Toaplan games was published exclusively in Japan by City Connection under their Clarice Disk label. In 2019, Japanese company M2 announced that in 2020 they will release every game by Toaplan (excluding Mahjong Sisters and Enma Dai≈ç) for consoles in Japan including Guardian.  Reception and legacy  According to Toaplan, Guardian was a commercial failure in arcades. The official world record for the game is held by Will Czeswinski with 1,058,420 points. Despite its failure, the game served as an influence for titles such as Locomalito's upcoming Star Guardian. In more recent years, the rights to the title and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by former Toaplan employee Masahiro Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

It was developed by Random Access and published by Virgin Mastertronic. It was released in Europe in 1990, for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Judge Dredd was criticized for its gameplay, which was viewed as repetitive. Gameplay Judge Dredd is a platform shoot 'em up game played across six levels set in the fictional Mega-City One. Playing as Judge Dredd, the player must stop criminals and face off against enemies at the end of each level, including Orlok and the Dark Judges. The player's weapon is Judge Dredd's Lawgiver gun, which has three types of ammo. The player must be aware of the city's crime rate, which gradually rises as the game progresses. If the crime rate becomes too high, the player loses. The player can ride around on Judge Dredd's Lawmaster bike for faster transportation, although using it will rapidly increase the crime rate, and the player cannot use weapons while riding it. Killing civilians also increases the crime rate. A bonus subgame is played after completing each level. Development and release In 1989, Virgin Mastertronic acquired the licence to publish a video game based on the Judge Dredd character. The game was developed by Random Access, the programming team for The Sales Curve. Simon Pick was the project manager. Pick had finished work on the Commodore 64 (C64) version of Shinobi, and he \\"had the vague idea that we'd just make a similar game, but styled to the Dredd universe. That seemed like a good idea until someone noted that Judge Dredd never jumped, at which point we should have given up on the idea of making it a platform game.\\" The development team proceeded with the idea and created mockups, but was unable to make them work in the game because of technical reasons. Ultimately, the team implemented orthographic projection designs into the game. Judge Dredd was released in Europe in 1990, for Amiga, Atari ST, C64, and ZX Spectrum. A version was also created for the Amstrad CPC. Reviews were published for the ZX Spectrum and CPC versions, but both were once believed to be unreleased. A copy of the ZX Spectrum version eventually surfaced on eBay in the mid 2010s. Reception Judge Dredd received average reviews. The gameplay was particularly criticized for being repetitive. Commodore Format called the gameplay \\"atrocious\\" and stated that it suffered from \\"gross unplayability,\\" writing that the crime rate \\"accelerates too rapidly.\\" CU Amiga considered the gameplay dull and wrote that the crime rate indicator \\"seems to have a mind of its own and doesn't follow any particular pattern.\\" Reviewers for Zzap!64 were critical of the crime rate difficulty on the Amiga version, but they found the C64 version to be easier. ACE was also critical of the gameplay, but wrote that the game, \\"Does a reasonable job of capturing some of the graphic humour\\" of the comic series. Your Sinclair called it a \\"nice attempt to capture the flavour of the character.\\" CU Amiga wrote that the game failed to capture the feel and action of the comic books. Robert Swan of Computer and Video Games considered it an improvement over an earlier Judge Dredd game, while CU Amiga considered both games substandard. Amiga Power considered it to be, \\"Another Judge Dredd game screwed up totally.\\" Crash stated that it was better than the previous Judge Dredd game. Garth Sumpter of Sinclair User wrote that the game \\"may not set any new standards for graphics, sound or gameplay, but it's full of authentic Dreddian detail which should appeal to fans.\\" Swan stated that the game was \\"full of glaring inaccuracies\\", such as the lack of weapons on the Lawmaster bike \\"which will leave any Dredd fans disappointed.\\" Zzap!64 criticized the graphics of the Amiga version but praised them on the C64. Commodore Format and Zero respectively praised the graphics of the C64 and Amiga versions. Other reviewers were critical of the graphics featured in the Atari ST and ZX Spectrum versions. Andy Hutchinson of ST Format wrote that the game visually \\"fails because it doesn't make enough of the cartoon style,\\" describing Judge Dredd's animation as \\"very average\\" and stating that he \\"sometimes looks as if he's moonwalking\\". Hutchinson, however, praised the \\"smooth and seamless\\" scrolling and the \\"attractive\\" backgrounds. In a review of the CPC version, John Taylor of Amstrad Computer User praised the graphics and scrolling. Zzap!64 criticized the music, and Hutchinson was critical of the sound. Zero praised the \\"neat intro screens and music\\".

Although South Africa was a founding member of the World Bank, its first loan agreement wasn‚Äôt signed until 1951, in the amount of $20,000,000. Since then, over 4.15 billion dollars has been approved for disbursement to South Africa from the World Bank in the form of loans to support a broad spectrum of development projects, with the majority of this funding currently allocated for projects in energy and resource extraction. South Africa‚Äôs voting power does not exceed 1% of the total voting power across the four composite institutions with voting authority that make up the World Bank Group.  Systematic country diagnostic  The World Bank‚Äôs SCD is a report prepared by the World Bank Group and a target country‚Äôs national authorities to identify critical challenges and priorities relevant to the national development goals that are consistent with the World Bank objectives of ending poverty and building shared prosperity. The most recent report on South Africa identified five fundamental causes associated with poverty and inequality in the country: insufficient skills related to education and vocational training, skewed asset bases for the poor and weak property rights that deter investors, low competition and low integration into global and regional value chains, limited connectivity and inadequate services in historically disadvantaged settlements, and climate shocks that disrupt the economy and availability of jobs.  Current projects  Since joining the World Bank in 1945, South Africa has accepted fifteen separate loans from the World Bank to fund a broad spectrum of national development projects ranging from energy, agriculture, finance, trade, sanitation, and more. Of those 15 loans, all but two have been closed, with remaining repayments still outstanding for nearly 5 billion USD in original principal. The remaining loans are primarily directed towards power supply and energy security to support economic growth targets and support South Africa's long term carbon mitigation strategy. The nationally owned power utility Eskom is responsible for this infrastructural development and has received the majority of the disbursements from active project loans.

Though bought as an infant slave for the Varnum family, he was eventually set free and fought in the Continental Army and as an American privateer.  Varnum Family  Silas Varnum was raised by the Varnum family of Dracut, Massachusetts to be the servant of young J.B. Varnum. The family had unorthodox views on the institution of slavery and the role of African Americans in colonial society, and would advocate for black soldiers to serve in the army during the war. J.B. Varnum developed a strong friendship with Silas, and later wrote the bill in Congress banning the slave trade. When Silas reached adulthood, the patriarch of the Varnums deciced to set him free. As a freedman Silas could have left the Varnum estate, but chose to stay and work as a paid servant. He took the name \\"Silas Royal\\" to celebrate his liberation.  War Service  When hostilities broke out Royal joined the provisional army around Boston. James Mitchell Varnum, brother of Royal's former owner, was assigned to command \\"Varnum's Regiment\\" by the Rhode Island assembly. Royal joined the regiment as a trusted servant to General Varnum and developed a dignified reputation. Varnum's Regiment saw action at the Battle of Bunker Hill and would eventually become the 1st Rhode Island, the only regiment in the Continental Army consisting of a majority of African American and Native American soldiers. Later, Royal served as a privateer aboard the Franklin, one of several small ships disrupting British supply lines during the continuing Siege of Boston. This was a dangerous and sometimes lucrative posting, and Royal once drew ¬£30 as his share of prize money after a voyage. Marines from the Marblehead Regiment, many of them also black, were attached to this vessel. Royal may have joined the Marblehead mariners at the Delaware Crossing.  Kidnapping  In 1778, a dispute arose between Silas Royal and a shipmate over the prize money Royal was entitled from a captured merchant ship. The privateer abducted Royal and stole his wages, then claimed to be his master and sold Royal to John White, a slave dealer in Woburn. Both men ignored Royal's freedom papers. Royal was in danger of being sent to the South to work and sold into plantation work. Handcuffed, he was imprisoned in a wagon on the road from Cambridge to Waltham. Royal called for help, but White drove the wagon drove quickly and no one on foot was able to give pursuit. Luckily, the Varnum family learned of the kidnapping in time and organized a posse to ride to Royal's rescue. John White, who knew Silas Royal was a free man, falsely claimed that Royal was a deserter and a thief who had stolen supplies from an army quartermaster. J.B. Varnum used his political standing to appeal to the authorities and was successful in securing Royal's release. The Varnums went so far as to report White's conduct to his superiors in Boston, leading to a tense confrontation. > He was extremely angry, Curst & Swore very Profainly, they dealt him very > sharply for his Conduct to Ryal. He said he did not know Ryal was free. They > told him that he could not know that his Crime alleged against Ryal for > which he was put in Gaol was true, but that he knew ye Contrary. He said all > such Damd Neagroes ought to be slaves. They told him that Ryal was as Good a > man, & of as much honour as he, at which he was extremely angry & profain. > Laid his hand on his Hanger by his side. They told him that they had seen > Hangers & men before they had seen him or his, that they was ready to answer > him any way he pleased, that they could not forget his Conduct towards Ryal, > that they on sd Ryal's Behalfe should bring an action of Damage for false > Imprisonment, that such arbitrary Tyrants & menstealers should not go > unpunished. Afterwards, J.B. Varnum helped Royal file a lawsuit against White. The court eventually ruled in Royal's favor and awarded him ¬£100 in damages.  Later life  Afterwards, Royal returned to the Varnum household and lived as a free man for the remainder of his years. In his will, J.B. Varnum left instructions that Royal be cared for \\"and honorably buried after death.\\" Silas died on May 3rd 1826. Silas was buried in the Varnum family cemetery in Dracut.

No single design for the lesbian flag has yet been widely adopted.  History  No flag design for a lesbian pride flag has been widely adopted. The labrys lesbian flag was created in 1999 by graphic designer Sean Campbell, and published in June 2000 in the Palm Springs edition of the Gay and Lesbian Times Pride issue. The design involves a labrys, a type of double-headed axe, superimposed on the inverted black triangle, set against a violet background. Among its functions, the labrys was associated as a weapon used by the Amazons of mythology. In the 1970s it was adopted as a symbol of empowerment by the lesbian feminist community. Women considered asocial by the Third Reich because they did not conform to the Nazi ideal of a woman, which included homosexual females, were condemned to concentration camps and wore an inverted black triangle badge to identify them. (Originally published in the Journal of Homosexuality, 1996, 30 (3): pp.1‚Äì11, , ) Some lesbians reclaimed this symbol as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle (many lesbians also reclaimed the pink triangle although lesbians were not included in Paragraph 175 of the German criminal code). The color violet became associated with lesbians via the poetry of Sappho. The \\"pink\\" lesbian flag consists of six shades of red and pink colors with a white bar in the center. The design is derived from the lipstick lesbian flag, which includes a red kiss and was introduced in the weblog This Lesbian Life in 2010. The lipstick lesbian flag represents \\"homosexual women who have a more feminine gender expression\\" and has not been widely adopted; however, its non- kiss pink variant attracted more use. An \\"orange-pink\\" lesbian flag modeled after the seven-band pink flag was introduced on Tumblr in 2018, with colors dark orange representing 'gender non-conformity', orange for 'independence', light orange for 'community', white for 'unique relationships to womanhood', pink for 'serenity and peace', dusty pink for 'love and sex', and dark rose for 'femininity'. The flag was also meant to include trans women. A five- stripes version was soon derived from the 2018 colors. (video) The orange-pink design was originally introduced in 2016 as a butch/femme flag and controversy arose in 2020 over who had actually originated an orange-pink flag.

Also No. 1, Harp-lane, in the rear of the above; consisting of a warehouse of 4 floors. Both are let to Mr. Benjamin Farrow, a highly respectable tenant, under an agreement for a lease of 21 years from Lady-day, 1827, at the yearly rent of ¬£70, clear of all deductions.‚ÄùThe Times, London, 12 November 1831 Benjamin Farrow had married Mary Algar in September, 1798; they had eight children. The last, Charles, was born in 1815, and he would grow up to take over the family business. Charles Farrow was twenty-nine in 1844 when his father died. In his turn, he was admitted into the Freedom of the City as an armourer and brazier. He married Ann Hinton, daughter of coal merchant and wharfinger William Samuel Hinton of Southwark in 1846. By 1850, Charles Farrow‚Äôs trade was described as ‚Äúironmonger, wine bin & wine coopers‚Äô tool maker.‚ÄùPost Office London Directory, 1850 Farrow took part in the Great Exhibition of 1851. His advertisement in the Exhibition Guide shows how his manufacturing and distribution business had branched out, describing him as ‚ÄúIronmonger, Smith, Brazier, Tinman, and Gas-Fitter; Manufacturer of Machines, Tools, and Utensils for the Wine and Spirit Trade‚Äù.Official Catalogue, Great Exhibition, 1851 {https://books.google.ca/books?id=OfMHAAAAQAAJ} At this time he was offering for sale a wide variety of lab equipment, bottling and corking apparatus, cellar lamps and candlesticks, woodworking tools, glass pipettes and India rubber hoses. Farrow presented his bottling and corking machine at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1855, and his ‚ÄúPatent Elutriator, for Decanting Wine, &c.;‚ÄùJournal of the Royal Society for the Arts Tenth Exhibition of Inventions, 1858 at the Royal Society‚Äôs 1858 Exhibition of Inventions. Few items from that time can be found marked with Farrow's name. Porcelain labels for wine bins and three types of corkscrew have survived. The Farrows had three children, two of whom lived to adulthood. Son Charles Hinton Farrow, born in 1848, would join the firm, which was soon to include a partner.  Farrow and Jackson  Richard Brooker Jackson was born in 1824 in Hertford, one of twelve children. Jackson worked as a grocer but was an ironmonger - possibly with Farrow - at the time of his marriage to Anna Maria Perkins in 1853. They had seven children; their son Algernon would eventually join the firm. Jackson's name is first seen in association with Charles Farrow‚Äôs in an 1860 advertisement for wrought iron wine bins. The Times, London, 6 December 1860 For the next decade, the firm advertised regularly in London newspapers. Most ads featured their custom wrought iron wine bins. In 1865, they announced an expansion: ‚ÄúFARROW and JACKSON, manufacturers of wrought-iron wine bins, registered cellular bins, machines, tools, and utensils for the wine and spirit trade, beg respectfully to inform their west- end customers and the public that, in addition to their old-established to their premises in Great Tower-street, city, and their factory in Mansell- street, they have opened a branch at No. 8, Haymarket, where they solicit an inspection of cellars fitted with every variety of winebins.‚Äù The Times, London, 4 May 1865 Advertisements in 1867 characterized the business as \\"Wine and Spirit Merchants' Engineers.\\" In 1869 came an expansion to Paris with an agent at 23, Rue de Pont Neuf, and \\"every article required for wine, from the press to crush the grapes to the decanting machine for the table.\\"The Morning Post, 9 June 1869 After the 1875 publication of a 128-page revised and updated catalogue, the newspaper ads ceased until their success at the 1884 London Exhibition. But they were well-enough known that real estate agents would point out the Farrow & Jackson cellar fittings in homes for sale. No less an authority than the renowned Mrs. Isabella Beeton, in her 1879 Housewife‚Äôs Treasury of Domestic Information, cautioned the Victorian homeowner that ‚Äúin the wine cellar the patent wine-bin is now a necessity.‚Äù She quoted directly from the Farrow & Jackson catalogue, referring to the their 1861-patented Cellular Bin and their 1865 patented Exhibit Wine-bin. While custom wines bins were always their specialty as manufacturers, Farrow and Jackson also catered to wine and spirit merchants who might buy a cask of some alcoholic beverage with a view to retailing the contents. Once you got your barrel, they sold you a stand to set it on, a gimlet for sampling it, a tool to get the bung out and a tap to replace it, an apparatus to tilt it, and cooper‚Äôs tools to rebuild it. As to the liquid, they sold you a cylinder to pour it in, a hydrometer to test it, bottles to fill with it, bottling machines, corks to keep it in along with machines to cut, brand and insert them, capsules to put over top and capsuling machines to do that job, then labels and label gumming machines. They sold you crates in which to ship your filled bottles and machines to clean the empties. If you had a sampling room to entice prospective buyers, they could furnish it with decanters, bottle holders, corkscrews, mahogany tasting stands to hold thirty glasses and the glasses to stock it with, and a spittoon to keep the floor clean. If your business was Champagne or carbonated water, all necessary equipment was available. Brewers were supplied with everything from grain shovels to lager beer engines. From Farrow & Jackson you could buy a bread slicer, an ice cream freezer, a tea pot, a newspaper rack and a sausage warmer. If you were chairman of the board, they offered you a rosewood hammer for meetings. It is unknown when he joined the company, but in 1880, Charles Hinton Farrow left his father Charles and Richard Brooker Jackson to direct the firm without him. In 1884, Charles Farrow died, and his brothers-in-law William and John Hinton carried on as directors in their capacity as his executors. The management restructured and they retired at the end of 1885. The new partnership consisted of Richard Brooker Jackson, his son Algernon Brooker Jackson, and Algar George Farrow, Charles Farrow‚Äôs nephew. Algernon Brooker Jackson had been training from his youth to qualify for his new position. He was educated in Germany and Switzerland as well as at University College, London. He studied theoretical engineering at the University of Hanover and apprenticed with engineering companies for seven years before coming to work at Farrow & Jackson in 1885. He became a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers before the end of the century.Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, 1926 The demand for carbonated waters, plain and flavoured, had been increasing through the 1800s. Charles Farrow's 1873 patent dealt with closures for aerated liquids. In 1890 Farrow & Jackson principals were involved in the formation of the Volcanic-A√´ration Company (Limited) whose goal was to sell their patented equipment to supply carbonated drinks on draughtThe Morning Post, 11 January 1890. Algernon Jackson was named as managing director. Later that year a second company, the North-Western Volcanic-A√´ration Company, had been formed and was advertising in the ‚ÄúAgencies and Commissions‚Äù columns for agents to call on brewers, chemists, licensed victuallers and grocers in the north and west counties.Birmingham Daily Post, 10 November 1890 Richard Brooker Jackson died in 1891. The title page of Farrow & Jackson's comprehensive 1894 catalogue describes them as \\"Manufacturers of Iron Wine Bins, Cellar and Bar Fittings, Bottle Wax, Seals, &c.;, Aerated Water and Beer Carbonating Machinery, Patent Beer Raising Apparatus, Brewers' and Bottlers' Requisites, &c.;\\" It displays their Royal Warrants to supply cellar equipment to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In 1897, Farrow & Jackson became a limited liability company with Algernon Brooker Jackson as managing director. The 1898 centenary catalogue of Farrow & Jackson Limited fills nearly 200 pages with supplies that now include necessities for catering and for \\"iced drink sundries.\\" Nine pages are devoted to their specialty, wine bins, which by that time had been supplied to a number or royal households including Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace, Marlborough House, Sandringham House, York House and Clarence House. In 1902, Farrow & Jackson published \\"American and Other Iced Drinks\\" featuring recipes for cocktails and illustrations of the necessary hardware to make them. The 1922 catalogue emphasizes the company's supplying the \\"Mineral Water, Bottling, Catering, and Hotel and Restaurant Trades\\". Algernon Jackson died in 1925. His obituary noted that the firm of Farrow & Jackson ‚Äúwere the first to introduce into this country and bring into general commercial use liquefied carbonic acid gas.‚Äù In 1930, a new company, Farrow & Jackson & Purdy Ltd., was registered to acquire the assets of Farrow & Jackson and to form a Purdy Patent Machinery Company to not only carry on the business but also expand into the manufacture and distribution of ‚Äúagricultural implements, conveyors, and other machinery‚Äù and ‚Äúchemicals and other preparations.‚ÄùThe Guardian, 13 October 1930 However, the Farrow & Jackson name was still prominent, as in this 1957 newspaper advertisement: ‚ÄúTAKE CARE OF YOUR WINES by storing in our inexpensive wine bins. Any size or shape made to order, triangular to fit under stairs if necessary. Farrow & Jackson Ltd. Dept R P 41-42 Prescot street, London E1.‚ÄùThe Observer, 25 August 1957 As recently as 1974, journalist and Guardian wine writer John Arlott promoted Farrow & Jackson in his columns, and referred in the present tense to their production of custom wine bins: ‚ÄúThe best known racks in this country are those produced by Farrow & Jackson in square, single-bottle openings of metal secured by wooden corner pieces. They are strong and secure and can be slanted or staggered to fit under the stairs or in any asymmetrical recess in the house.‚ÄùThe Guardian, 7 March 1974 Inventions & Patents With two exceptions noted, the patent information is found in the British National Archives.National Archives, United Kingdom {https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/results/r?_q=Farrow&_ser=BT%2045&id;=C3088} *1825 Feb 19 (Benjamin Farrow) - No. 5097: Improvement or improvements in buildings, calculated to render them less likely to be destroyed or injured by fire than heretofore *1851 Apr 23 (Charles Farrow) - No. 3227 (Useful Registered Design): Self-closing valve *1861 Dec 31 (Charles Farrow) - No. 1725: Apparatus for Applying Capsules to the Necks of Bottles and other Vessels *1861 Mar 1 (Farrow & Jackson) - No. 4343 (Useful Reg‚Äôd Design): Bottle rack [Cellular] *1862 Jun 20 (Farrow & Jackson) - No. 4490 (Useful Reg‚Äôd Design): A screw bottle stopper *1865 Feb 22 (Farrow & Jackson) - No. 4695 (Useful Reg‚Äôd Design): Bottle rack [Exhibit] *1865 Nov 9 (Farrow & Jackson) - No. 4753 (Useful Reg‚Äôd Design): Apparatus for corking bottles *1866 Jun 29 (Farrow & Jackson) - No. 4797 (Useful Reg‚Äôd Design): A filter for filtering wine *1867 Jul 27 (Farrow & Jackson) - No. 4874 (Useful Reg‚Äôd Design): A stand or holder for drinking glasses *1868 May 13 (Charles Farrow) - No. 1558: Apparatus for cleansing bottles, jars and casks *1870 Mar 23 (Charles Farrow & Richard Brooker Jackson) - (Application) No. 854: Construction of iron wine bins *1872 Nov 16 (Richard Brooker Jackson) - No. 3427: Improvements in Racks for Bottles [The Exhibition] *1873 Jan 18 (Charles Farrow) - No. 218 [provisional patent]: Improvements in stoppering bottles for aerated or gaseous liquids *1881 May 31 (Charles Farrow & Richard Brooker Jackson) - No. 2400: Improvements in apparatus or stands for holding bottles containing effervescent and still liquids *1883 July 21 (Richard Brooker Jackson) - No. 3594: An improved box or case for parcels post and like purposes *1885 Apr 28 (Richard Brooker Jackson) - No. 5238: Improvements in corkscrewsWallis, Fletcher: British Corkscrew Patents from 1795.

Geography  The smaller Bellbird Bush Scenic Reserve, Opouahi Scenic Reserve and Thomas Bush Scenic Reserved are also located in the Maungaharuru Ranges. The rest of the range is farmland. Taraponui Peak is a part of this range, rising to 1308 metres. The range is rugged with high winds, this environment has attracted two wind farm consents for a Hawke's Bay wind farm.  Renewable Generation  In 2005 two consents were issued in the Maungaharuru area, one for the private company Hawkes Bay Wind Farm Ltd and the other by Unison Networks Limited. The two consents were purchased by Meridian Energy in 2010 and 2011 respectively and were combined as one site, these consents were extended to 2023. In August 2019 Meridian sought interest from potential contractors for the wind farm's construction. Construction would be expected to begin in 2020. See Hawke's Bay Wind Farm.

Extending along Marlborough Street (Connecticut Route 66) east of Main Street, it includes twelve houses built between 1847 and 1900 in a variety of architectural styles. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Marlborough Street is one of Portland's major thoroughfares, running southeasterly from Main Street and connecting neighboring Middletown to points east. Main Street (Connecticut Route 17A) historically separated the upper and lower classes of the community, whose economy was dominated by the large brownstone quarries between Main Street and the Connecticut River. Marlborough Street became the place where the business elite of the community built their homes in the late 19th century. Owners of the houses built here include members of the Brainerd family which controlled the quarries, and executives of their company. The district's oldest house is the 1830 Hart-Jarvis House, a Greek Revival structure that was later owned by quarry owner Erastus Brainerd Sr. His son built the adjacent Italianate villa in 1852, which is one of the district's most sophisticated buildings and may have been designed by Henry Austin. Gilbert Stancliffe, another quarry executive, and his brother-in-law Joseph Williams built the Williams and Stancliff Octagon Houses, which are the only known pair of octagon houses inspired by Orson Squire Fowler. Most of these architecturally significant buildings line the northeastern side of the street; on the south side are a cluster of houses that were adapted for use as a private psychiatric hospital in 1938. That complex has in the late 2010s become the subject of redevelopment initiatives, while a number of the other buildings in the district are now used for professional offices rather than residences.

In 2019 It Will Be Chaos won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Current Affairs documentary at the 40th News & Documentary Emmy Awards. It Will Be Chaos also won the Best Directing Award at the 2018 Taormina Film Festival. Translated into over 10 languages, the documentary has been distributed worldwide. Other documentary films documenting the European migration crisis include Simshar (2014), Fire at Sea (2016), Human Flow (2017), and Sea Sorrow (2017).  Summary  It Will be Chaos is a documentary about the European refugee crisis, told through the stories of asylum seekers fleeing war and repression. The documentary also interviews local populations left to cope with the overwhelming influx of newcomers while facing their own economic woes. The film features two stories of refugees on their journeys to the E.U. and it unfolds between Western Europe and the Balkan region. Eritrean refugee Aregai survives the 2013 sinking of a migrant boat off the island of Lampedusa. The final death toll of the shipwreck is never to be known, but 194 bodies were recovered and 368 people were declared missing.Migrant deaths: 19,000 in Mediterranean in past 6 years. Infomigrants 2019-10-09. After Aregai is rescued by two local fishermen, he finds himself trapped in the broken Italian immigration system and flees underground all the way to Sweden in his quest for political asylum. The story of Aregai is intercut with the perils of a Syrian family fleeing Damascus in search of safety in Europe. Wael, the head of the family, with his wife Doha, their four young children and three nephews, trek the 2,500-mile Balkan route through border crossings, checkpoints, and refugee detention centers. The family travels the distance learning about the routes thanks to smartphones with GPS and word of mouth tips. Five years in the making, It Will Be Chaos plunges the audience onto a harrowing road trip through multiple epicenters of the escalating migrant crisis: *border islands overwhelmed by the influx of asylum seekers such as Lampedusa, headed by Mayor Giusi Nicolini; *model migrant towns like Riace in the poorest Italian regions where mayors must answer to refugees given the central government's inaction; *Europe's largest prison-like migrant centers such as Crotone where refugees' frustration erupts into riots; *humanitarian corridors such as the Balkan route; *and forgotten corners of major cities like Rome with asylum seekers squatting in crumbling government buildings.

It is situated northwest of Squamish, and southeast of Mount Tantalus, which is the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Pelops, to the west. Lake Lovely Water lies below the northwestern slope of the peak with Alpha Mountain on the opposite side of the lake. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1916 by Tom Fyles and his brother, John Fyles. The mountain's name comes from Omega, in keeping with nearby peaks being named for Greek alphabet letters, namely Alpha and Iota mountains. Its name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Sea to Sky Highway with Pelops and Niobe to right Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Omega Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports a small glacier remnant on the northeast slope of Omega.

It was founded or built in 1368-69 CE (770 AH) on the order of Sultan al-Ashraf Sha'ban in honour of his mother, Khawand Baraka (also referred to as Umm al- Sultan Sha'ban). It is adjoined to the north by the Bayt al-Razzaz palace.  Historical background  Darb al-Ahmar street (also called here Bab al-Wazir Street) in front of the madrasa, with the minaret visible. The adjacent Bayt al-Razzaz Palace (right) is also visible. Al-Ashraf Sha'ban was a grandson of al-Nasir Muhammad and ruled from 1363 to 1377, being only 10 years old when he came to the throne. His mother, Khawand Baraka, was one of the most notable powerful women in Egypt at this time. She was concubine then wife to Husayn (Sha'ban's father), a son of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad who never rose to the throne. When Husayn died in 1362, she married the amir Aljay al-Yusufi (who built his own madrasa in the nearby Suq al-Silah street). She grew more influential and well-known when Sha'ban came to the throne as a child. Sha'ban commissioned this madrasa and mausoleum in 1368-69 (770 AH) reportedly to honour his mother who was on pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca at the time. However, given his young age (15) at the time, there is a fair chance that the decision to build the madrasa was in accordance with his mother's own wishes, especially as there are few other examples of such impressive monuments being built for the female relatives of Mamluk sultans. Khawand returned to Cairo the next year (in 1369-70) and endowed the mosque. She died in 1373 and was buried in the larger of the two mausoleums attached to her madrasa. In 1375 Sha'ban founded and embarked on the construction of his own ambitious mosque, madrasa, and mausoleum complex in 1375, on the location of what is now the Maristan of al-Mu'ayyad, at the northwestern foot of the Citadel. It was lavishly decorated and, like his mother's madrasa, it had two domes (probably inspired by the double-domed mausoleums to the south of the Citadel, such as the Sultaniyya Mausoleum). However, Sha'ban was assassinated in 1377, before his mausoleum complex was finished and ready for use. He ended up instead being buried in the smaller mausoleum of his mother's madrasa. The complex he had begun to build was eventually dismantled by Sultan Faraj ibn Barquq in 1411 in order to reuse its materials for a number of other buildings including the so-called Zawiya of Faraj ibn Barquq, located in front of Bab Zuweila, and the madrasa-mosque of his emir Jamal al-Din Ustadar. Once completed, the madrasa taught Islamic law in the Hanafi and Shafi'i madhhabs. Some excellent illuminated manuscripts of the Qur'an date from Sha'ban's reign and it is believed that this madrasa may have contained a workshop for producing them. The Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo also has other well-crafted artifacts that come from this madrasa. In the late 15th century, Sultan Qaytbay built a palace or mansion adjacent to the madrasa. In the 19th century, the palace was merged with another adjacent mansion built in 1776 by Ahmad al-Razzaz. The building is now known as Bayt al-Razzaz, and today its facade is contiguous with the facade of the madrasa of Sha'ban. Starting in 2000, the building was restored by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.  Architectural description  The madrasa, its domes, and its minaret, seen from the south.The overall plan of the building is arranged around a central courtyard and two mausoleum chambers with domes. = Exterior =  Layout  The layout of the complex is somewhat unusual due to its unusual site at the corner of the main street (Tabbana street, the continuation of al-Darb al-Ahmar street) and a minor side street joining it at an angle. The floor plan of the complex deals with this by forming a three-sided facade around this corner. The monumental main entrance is at the northern end of the eastern facade, but a small side entrance to the madrasa existed on the western side. The complex has two domes corresponding to the two mausoleum chambers inside. The minaret and the larger mausoleum dome (which belonged to Khawand's mausoleum) stand together at the southwestern corner, right where the two streets join, thus maximizing their visibility. The exterior of the two domes is ribbed or fluted, like other Mamluk domes of the period (e.g. the Sultaniyya Mausoleum or the nearby Madrasa of Aljay al-Yusufi). Around the drums of the domes are inscriptions in Arabic. Originally, the letters of the inscription were gilded against a green background. The top of the octagonal minaret collapsed or was destroyed in recent centuries, but has been reconstructed (based on photographs of the old one) in the most recent restoration completed in 2007. The exterior walls of the building are tall and imposing (around 18 meters high). The triple windows near its upper parts are partly decorative, seeing as some of the windows (on the left, overlapping with the qibla iwan inside) are blind (i.e. blocked) and don't serve to allow light in. The decoration of the entrance portal.  Entrance portal  The entrance portal is one of the building's most remarkable features. Like many Mamluk buildings, the entrance is set in a recess within the exterior walls, the top of which is crowned with a muqarnas (stalactite or honeycomb-like carvings). The muqarnas canopy here is more or less pyramid-shaped like the entrance portal of Seljuk/Mongol buildings in Muslim Anatolia at the time, possibly of the same inspiration as the portal of Sultan Hassan's massive madrasa-mosque, built just over a decade earlier. Nonetheless, the overall decorative design is Mamluk and features heavy use of multi-colored stone and marble. Right below the muqarnas hood is a triple window (smaller but of similar shape as the other triple windows on the building's exterior) flanked on either side by shallow decorative niches in the shape of pointed arches, all featuring multi-colored stone. There are also several inscriptions in Arabic, both carved and inlaid, of one word or of whole passages, around the portal. One inscription wraps around two arch- shaped decorative niches on the sides and around a triple window in the middle, winding its way up and down from one side of the portal to the other. Smaller one-word inscriptions include the word Allah inlaid around the triple window, and small black-and-white inscriptions at the center of the decorative niches on either side. The triangular muqarnas hood at the top of the portal is also framed by an outer rectangular frame filled with carved arabesques, albeit relatively faded.  Sabil and trough  sabil next to the entrance portal. Two other minor features existed on either side of the portal. On the left is a delicately carved wooden screen which is part of the sabil, a kiosk that dispensed water freely. On the right was a drinking trough (Arabic: hod) for animals, above which is a carved inscription band with the epigraphic blazon or cartouche of Sultan Sha'ban. = Interior = The entrance portal leads to a long stone-vaulted passage with the madrasa and its central courtyard on the left and some annexes on the right. These annex rooms are part of a series of rooms located within the outer parts of the complex, wrapped around the madrasa courtyard and distributed along three stories. These included service rooms for staff and living quarters for the students. The rectangular main courtyard of the madrasa is surrounded by iwans on four sides in a cruciform configuration. The iwans along the qibla axis (i.e. aligned with the direction of prayer) are larger than the transverse iwans. A monumental inscription runs along the top of the courtyard's walls, above the openings of the iwans, and features a verse of the Qur'an (3:190-192, from the Surah Ali 'Imran). The iwans had richly painted and gilded wooden ceilings, with the ceiling of the southern iwan being well-preserved and restored today. The southeastern iwan is the qibla iwan (the one pointing in the direction of prayer) and features a mihrab which, along with the surrounding wall, is decorated in multi-coloured marble. The qibla iwan is flanked on either side by the two mausoleum chambers, accessed from the sides of the courtyard. The smaller mausoleum, on the right (to the south) has no mihrab, while the larger mausoleum, on the left (to the north) has a mihrab flanked by two windows. The larger mausoleum contains the tomb of Khawand Baraka (Umm al-Sultan Sha'ban) and a daughter of Sha\\"ban, while the smaller museum ended up being the tomb of Sultan Sha'ban himself (when his other mausoleum complex was unfinished upon his death) and one of his sons al-Mansur Hajji. Both mausoleum domes have simple round squinches in the transition zone between the square chamber and the round base of the dome above rather than the more typical muqarnas- sculpted pendentives found in Mamluk architecture. The squinches nonetheless have some decoration by using two-coloured masonry with a radiating motif. Other than this, the mausoleums are unadorned. A doorway off the larger mausoleum leads to an irregularly-shaped room sandwiched between other chambers in the floor plan. The room has a richly-decorated ceiling (similar to the painted and gilded wooden ceilings of the courtyard iwans). It is thought that this room may have been used as a workshop to create Qur'an manuscripts, and/or as place to store them.

The dismissal capped a \\"chaotic finish to a high-profile trial\\" where a judge first announced that the jury found Rialmo unjustified in his shooting of LeGrier, but erased the verdict promptly, after declaring that the jury found Rialmo feared for his life when he shot LeGrier. Overview Officer Rialmo, who confronted 19-year-old LeGrier brandishing a baseball bat, shot LeGrier after he had swung the bat at Rialmo twice. Unbeknownst to the responding police officers, LeGrier had a history of behavioral issues and had previous episodes with law enforcement. Additionally, one of Rialmo's bullets struck and killed a neighbor, 55-year- old Jones, which had been intended for LeGrier. Attorneys for the City of Chicago initially argued against Rialmo, contending he could have employed an alternative method of force. However, Rialmo was unequipped with a Taser on December 26, 2015. The Cook County State‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs Office reviewed the incident and concluded that there wasn‚Äôt any evidence to charge Officer Rialmo, stating that he had acted within boundaries and standards set forth by CPD and State of Illinois police conduct. This led to LeGrier‚Äôs family filing a lawsuit in civil court for wrongful death, but the 2018 verdict had also found Rialmo's shooting justified, ruling that Rialmo had reacted out of reasonable fear when confronted by LeGrier who was swinging a baseball bat at him. A judge presiding over the wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Chicago and CPD Officer Robert Rialmo for the fatal shooting of Quintonio LeGrier in 2015 reversed a jury finding in favor of the teen's family. The jury's decision of justifiable homicide was unanimously supported by Chicago's Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson and Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police. Rialmo countered with his own lawsuit of ‚Äúemotional pain inflicted as a result of the shooting.‚Äù Neither Rialmo nor the LeGrier family received any compensation from their respective lawsuits; the family of Bettie Jones received $16 million. Controversy arose when the Chicago Police Board and its fledgling independent civilian arm, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), was found to have hired an outside expert on the judicial use of force to investigate the shooting. It also was uncovered that COPA hid the report after their third party expert found the Rialmo shooting to be justified, overriding COPA's initial report of wrongdoing. CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson objected to COPA's concealment of their expert‚Äôs discrepant findings. Johnson further affirmed that the shooting was lawful and in-policy, reiterating his earlier decision of defending Officer Rialmo. However, his objections were disregarded and a disciplinary case was sent to the Chicago Police Board nonetheless. Eventually, the controversy culminated in Superintendent Eddie Johnson‚Äôs reversal of his original decision and stated that Rialmo was unjustified in the shooting of LeGrier and Jones, which contradicted his early defense of Rialmo calling the shooting justified. The Chicago Police Accountability Task Force (CPATF) called for by Mayor Rahm Emmanuel to investigate the shooting of Laquan McDonald and headed by the present Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot, recommended Officer Rialmo be fired in December 2017. After months of controversy, investigations, and flip-flops, Rialmo was dismissed from the Chicago Police Department in October 2019. Profile =Quintonio LeGrier= Quintonio LeGrier was 19 years old, born on Chicago‚Äôs South Side and raised by a foster mother from the age of five. On the morning of December 26, 2015, he argued with his biological father and mother concerning his withdrawal from Northern Illinois University where he was a student in its College of Engineering in DeKalb, Illinois. LeGrier had been arrested by the DeKalb Police Department on five different occasions. On January 15, 2015 and March 1, 2015, he was charged with resisting arrest, obstruction and attempting to disarm an officer. The following day, March 2, 2015, he was arrested and recharged with obstruction. On May 6, 2015, LeGrier was arrested a fourth time and charged with aggravated battery. He was arrested a fifth time, September 22, 2015, and charged with disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting/obstructing an officer. LeGrier had a history of behavioral issues and ‚Äúon more than one occasion sought medical help for his erratic behavior.‚Äù =CPD Officer Robert Rialmo= Robert Rialmo was born and raised on Chicago‚Äôs North Side. He joined the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and was deployed for one tour of duty in Afghanistan. After serving four years, he was honorably discharged from the USMC and joined the Chicago Police Department. Timeline of Events =911 Call= On December 26, 2015 at approximately 4:28 AM, Chicago Police Officer Robert Rialmo and his partner, Anthony LaPalermo, working in the Austin CPD district, were dispatched to 4710 W. Erie, in the Garfield Park neighborhood, responding to four separate 911 calls requesting ‚Äúurgent police assistance.‚Äù The first three of the four 911 calls were made by Quintonio LeGrier, during which he told the dispatcher that someone was threatening his life and requested police assistance. Shortly after, Antonio LeGrier, Quintonio LeGrier‚Äôs father, called 911. He told the 911 dispatcher that his son was armed with a baseball bat and was trying to break down his bedroom door. Neither the son, Quintonio LeGrier, nor his father, Antonio LeGrier, offered additional details, such as requesting a crisis healthcare worker. Based on the information provided by the 911 calls, the 911 dispatchers, and then relayed data to the responding officers, none were aware that Quintonio LeGrier suffered from ‚Äúbehavioral issues and that he also had prior contact with law enforcement in which he demonstrated erratic behavior.‚Äù LeGrier‚Äôs prior conduct and behavioral issues would ‚Äúlikely be admissible in any criminal proceeding against the officers as corroborative evidence of witness statements describing LeGrier‚Äôs behavior that morning, which were described as threatening and erratic.\\" =Police response= On the morning of December 26, 2015, CPD Officers Rialmo and LaPalermo approached his father's residence at 4710 W. Erie in Chicago. Rialmo went to the front door with his partner, who was behind him and rang the doorbell. The neighbor, Bettie Jones, opened the front door for Officer Rialmo. Following this, ‚ÄúQuintonio LeGrier was heard opening the upstairs apartment door and running down the stairs toward the front landing, then opened the door and stepped between Rialmo and Jones brandishing an aluminum baseball bat.‚Äù As the officers began to move back, LeGrier ‚Äúmoved towards them with the aluminum baseball bat raised in both hands above his head.\\" Rialmo and his partner retreated down the stairs while maintaining visual contact on LeGrier, but LeGrier kept advanced in a threatening manner and ‚Äúswinging the bat.‚Äù As the officers retreated down the stairs, LaPalermo tapped Rialmo on his back and shouted: ‚ÄúLook out!‚Äù LeGrier ‚Äúcontinued to charge the officers‚Äù Rialmo drew his service weapon (9mm Luger) and ‚Äúfired eight times towards LeGrier.\\" LeGrier was shot at least six times and fell across the threshold of Jones‚Äô apartment door. The fifty-five-years-old Jones was also shot once in the chest from a bullet intended for LeGrier and died. She fell to the floor, near the entrance of her first floor apartment. Aftermath =Cook County State's Attorney= Facing an outcry from the community regarding another Chicago Police Department-related shooting of a young African-American man, Laquan McDonald, Chicago‚Äôs Mayor Rahm Emmanuel requested answers from the CPD. The Cook County State's Attorney sought criminal charges against Rialmo, but could not find any reason for prosecuting him. ‚ÄúA criminal prosecution for first or second-degree murder would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Rialmo was not legally justified in using deadly force against LeGrier.\\" In other words, a judge or jury would ‚Äúneed to determine and establish that Officer Rialmo did not reasonably believe he, or his partner LaPalermo, were in imminent danger of great bodily harm from LeGrier.‚Äù Irrefutable evidence confirmed that LeGrier was armed with a weapon when the officers responded to a 911 call and that LeGrier was brandishing a weapon in a threatening manner while charging the officers. Under Illinois law, \\"a baseball bat is considered a deadly weapon.\\" The evidence was insufficient to endorse the prosecution of Officer Rialmo beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not legally justified in shooting LeGrier. In addition, it does not support a prosecution for the death of Bettie Jones, which under Illinois law states that an individual acting in self-defense and kills a bystander accidentally is not criminally liable for the bystander‚Äôs death. (People v. Getter, 2015 IL App (1st) 121307). Therefore, if Rialmo was legally justified in using deadly force against LeGrier, he could not be criminally charged with the death of Bettie Jones applying the ‚Äúsame legal analysis as the shooting of LeGrier.‚Äù Additionally, the Cook County State's Attorney could not establish the fact beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Rialmo engaged in any criminal conduct when he fired his weapon causing the deaths of both LeGrier and Jones and announced that Officer Rialmo acted in self-defense out of fear of being killed. =Wrongful Death Civil Action= Three days after the shooting, a civil action was filed by the LeGrier Family on December 28, 2015 by attorney Bill Foutris for wrongful death. The trial lasted up until June 26, 2018. Experts hired by the City of Chicago testified that Rialmo had followed proper procedures. Defense attorneys Brian Gainer and Joel Brodsky called an expert witness, Emanuel Kapelsohn, who had been hired by the city to review the case. In his testimony, he said Officer Rialmo's use of deadly force was \\"in line with police standards.\\" He also told jurors that LeGrier posed a threat since he was swinging a deadly weapon as he walked toward Rialmo, and called attention to ‚ÄúLeGrier's father, who had locked himself in his bedroom and called the police to control his son.‚Äù The LeGriers could not corroborate that they claimed Rialmo retreated several feet off the front porch and was in no immediate physical danger since they were locked in their bedroom and could not have witnessed the shooting. Kapelsohn said that officers are trained to shoot in the chest, and as many times as necessary to remove any threats which in this case was fear of losing his life. Contentions that bullet casings found by the sidewalk confirmed Rialmo's distance from LeGrier, nullifying Rialmo's claim that he was in imminent danger, were discounted by the defense and Kapelohn since numerous paramedics and other CPD officers arriving at the scene could have inadvertently kicked them while attempting to administer emergency aid to LeGrier and Jones. Additionally, the defense contended that the normal ejection of bullet casings from Rialmo's pistol would have placed the casings away from Rialmo's position and by the sidewalk as he shot LeGrier. A judgment in favor of the defendants, Robert Rialmo and the City of Chicago, was reached on June 26, 2018. Rialmo was found not guilty of wrongful death and the City of Chicago was also exonerated. A new trial was subsequently denied. The appellate court mandate for an appeal was dismissed on August 2, 2018. =Counterclaim by Rialmo= A lawsuit was filed by Robert Rialmo's attorney, Joel Brodsky, on February 5, 2016. Rialmo claimed in the countersuit that he had been assaulted and afflicted with emotional distress as a result of the shooting. He asked for more than $10 million from LeGrier‚Äôs estate for emotional damage. ‚ÄúLeGrier knew his actions toward Officer Rialmo were extreme and outrageous, and that his conduct was atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community,‚Äù the complaint states. It stated that by ‚Äúforcing Officer Rialmo to end LeGrier‚Äôs life and Jones‚Äôs innocent life caused him to suffer extreme emotional trauma.‚Äù =Judge Reverses Award to the LeGrier Family= Judge Rena Marie Van Tine first announced that jurors had sided in favor of Quintonio LeGrier's parents who sued the City of Chicago and Officer Rialmo and awarded them $1.05 million in damages. But seconds later, Judge Van Tine revealed that the jurors had also signed a specific interrogatory, which is a clear and definitive question to a jury. The jury unanimously found that Rialmo fired because LeGrier posed grave danger of death or bodily harm to himself or his partner. Therefore, the judge said that the answer to that specific question overrode the verdict. Cook County initially awarded $1.05 million to LeGrier's parents, Janet Cooksey and Antonio LeGrier. The family had sued for $25 million. However, Judge Rena Marie Van Tine reversed the decision after learning that the jury found Rialmo had feared for his life when responding to the 911 call in the special interrogatory. The judicial decision meant that the family would not receive the predetermined award of $1.05 million. Jurors specifically signed an interrogatory finding that Rialmo fired from reasonable fear of death. Judge Van Tine ruled that the interrogatory outweighed any prior decision in favor of LeGrier's estate, and instead, found in favor of Rialmo. The jury also found in Rialmo‚Äôs favor concerning his lawsuit filed against the LeGrier estate for infliction of emotional distress. However, the jury did not award Rialmo any monetary award. Jury foreman, David Fitzsimmons, said that the jurors \\"didn‚Äôt believe Rialmo was a bad person, [but] he made a bad decision at that split moment.‚Äù Rialmo's defense attorney, Joel Brodsky, said that the strained relationship LeGrier's parents had with their son factored into the jury's decision not to award any money for pain and suffering since LeGrier was raised by a legal guardian until he turned eighteen-years-old. Rialmo was quoted as saying, \\"I will always regret that I was forced to end the lives of two people. Even being justified does not change the fact that it was a tragedy for everyone, including the people of Chicago, whom I only wanted to [serve] and protect.\\" =Bettie Jones Settlement= On January 4, 2016, a civil action was filed by Latarsha Jones on behalf of Bettie Jones, by Chicago attorneys Power, Roger & Smith for wrongful death, which lasted until September 5, 2018. The City of Chicago reached a settlement to pay $16 million to the family of Bettie Jones, the innocent bystander who opened the door for CPD Officer Rialmo the morning of December 26, 2015 and was accidentally killed. =CPD Superintendent defends Rialmo= CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson defended his earlier approval that Rialmo's decision was justified, even though it was in disagreement with Mayor Emanuel's newly appointed Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA). Johnson maintained his defense of Rialmo while stating that although the double shooting was a tragedy, he maintained his support of Rialmo over fatal shootings. In December 2017, COPA recommended Rialmo be fired, asserting that their investigators found no evidence to support Rialmo‚Äôs claim that the shooting was justified. But in March 2018, Johnson rejected COPA‚Äôs assertions and maintained that Rialmo‚Äôs shooting was justified and within department policy. ‚ÄúAn investigation should not second-guess an officer‚Äôs decisions by suggesting how COPA itself would have resolved the incident. Instead, an investigation must address the question of whether the officer, while making split-second decisions in tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances, acted like any other reasonable CPD member on the scene would have done,‚Äù Johnson wrote in a letter responding to COPA‚Äôs findings. =Rialmo's disciplinary hearing by Chicago Police Board= The impasse between CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson continued in March 2018. Both COPA and Johnson could not reach an agreement over any disciplinary action, if any, should be taken against Rialmo. The disagreement meant that a single member of the Chicago Police Board could act as a tie-breaker to decide whether or not the full board would hear a case against Rialmo or not, even though Rialmo was acquitted of wrongful death and had acted in fear of being killed earlier. Chicago Police Board member Eva- Nina Delgado voted to move Rialmo‚Äôs case forward on April 19, 2018. Since this single member of the Chicago Police Board sided with COPA, Rialmo would face disciplinary action by the Chicago Police Board and its eight other mayoral- appointed members. =CPD Superintendent Assails Rialmo= Seven months later, on November 7, 2018, Eddie Johnson eventually filed disciplinary charges with the Chicago Police Board and recommended that Rialmo be fired over Jones‚Äô death. Vice President Martin Preib of Chicago‚Äôs Fraternal Order of Police criticised Johnsons‚Äô volte-face as: ‚ÄúIt was our understanding that the superintendent has determined this shooting was justified. The Fraternal Order of Police would be sorely disappointed if the leadership of the department has changed that decision.‚Äù The charges filed by Johnson include: 1) accusing Rialmo of disobeying an order, 2) inattention to duty, 3) bringing discredit on the department, and 4) unlawful use of a weapon for fatally shooting Jones and inattention to duty, and incompetence, for improperly firing his weapon into a home occupied by a person who would be at risk of injury or death, and 5) incompetence for failing to re-qualify to carry a Taser. =CPD Officer Rialmo Dismissed= The CPD‚Äôs Eddie Johnson, who supported Rialmo for months, now reinforced the Chicago Police Board's decision to terminate Rialmo. After relentless investigations, Eddie Johnson also embraced the decision by the Chicago Police Board, voting unanimously on October 17, 2019 to dismiss Officer Robert Rialmo over the 2015 shootings. The board contended that it was a matter of dispute as to what happened when Rialmo arrived at the LeGrier home. LeGrier‚Äôs family claims Rialmo retreated several feet off the front porch and was in no immediate physical danger, but the LeGriers were behind a barricaded bedroom door and could not corroborate their earlier statements. Rialmo continued to claims that LeGrier swung the bat within inches of his head. Experts who offered their opinions contradicted one another. The superintendent eventually backed the Rialmo ruling by the Chicago Police Board. Impact =Mayor Emanuel Retires= The shooting of Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones came on the heels of the Laquan McDonald shooting, which not only furthered the dismissal of Chicago Police Officer Robert Rialmo, but the demise of the mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel. The shakeup from the prior high-profile Laquan McDonald shooting ended in the firing of Garry McCarthy as superintendent of police, the establishment of the CPATF, and the ousting of Anita Alvarez as State's Attorney. The shooting of Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones occurred prior to the step-down of Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his decision not to seek re-election for Mayor of Chicago. On December 28, 2015, Emanuel announced that he was cutting short his Cuban vacation to \\"deal with the crisis.\\" Since Officer Rialmo had testified that his Taser licensing was out-of-date and therefore was not armed with a Taser on the night of the LeGrier shooting, Emanuel announced several major changes to the Chicago police department on December 30, 2015, such as \\"doubling the number of Tasers issued to officers.\\" Continued press assaults on Emanuel, such as the use of body-cams and the uncovering of hidden emails from the McDonald shooting, only served to fuel the media. The New Yorker's article on Emanuel only added to the already negative national media attention surrounding the mayor. More importantly, Emanuel's public opinion polls regarding his popularity in Chicago fell. Emanuel's decision not to seek re-election followed. The CPATF continues to augment the already recommended establishment of a smart 911 system for emergency responders, allowing residents to pre-enter information on mental health or other behavioral issues and to expand the crisis intervention team for CPD and other first responders. Additionally, the CPATF released a statement saying it ‚Äúrespects the Chicago Police Board's decision to terminate Mr. Robert Rialmo following its objective and thorough investigation into the 2015 officer-involved shooting resulting in the deaths of Quintonio LeGrier and Bettie Jones.‚Äù =Dismissal of Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson= On October 17, 2019, the same night as the Rialmo dismissal and after addressing the media, Eddie Johnson was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car by CPD. Johnson explained that he was out with a group of friends for dinner and admitted that he passed out in his vehicle with the engine running. Although Johnson has had health troubles during his nearly four years as superintendent, which included a kidney transplant by his son, a CPD officer, he was not concerned about an investigation into the incident by the city inspector general‚Äôs office. The responding CPD officers allowed Johnson to drive home on his own volition without a field sobriety test, inciting controversy of usurping proper police protocol, which Johnson had accused Rialmo of doing the night of the LeGrier/Jones shooting. Johnson later admitted to Mayor Lori Lightfoot he had been drinking alcohol before he fell asleep at the wheel of his city-owned SUV. A week later, Johnson boycotted President Trump's speech at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago on October 27, 2019. Trump called Johnson's values and his absence a \\"disgrace.\\" Johnson said he would not attend the conference \\"while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office.\\" Johnson conceded that the past four years had been \\"trying\\" and planned to call a news conference for his timely departure from the CPD. On November 7, 2019, Johnson called a news conference announcing his retirement, and said it was ‚Äútime for someone else to pin these four stars to their shoulders.‚Äù Johnson hoped to remain at his post until the end of 2019. Retired Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck was appointed as Chicago‚Äôs interim police superintendent by Mayor Lori Lightfoot as the successor to Eddie Johnson. On December 2, 2019, Superintendent Johnson was unexpectedly dismissed two weeks before he was ready to retire, ending a tumultuous term as chief of the CPD. Mayor Lightfoot said that \\"Eddie Johnson intentionally misled me.\\" References Category:2015 in Illinois Category:2010s in Chicago Category:African-American- related controversies Category:Chicago Police Department Category:December 2015 events in the United States ","title":"Dismissal of Robert Rialmo"},{"id":"62275700","title":"Anjali Jathar"},{"id":"62275701","text":"Sandokan Against the Leopard of Sarawak (Italian: Sandokan contro il leopardo di Sarawak) is a 1964 historical adventure film directed by Luigi Capuano and starring Ray Danton, Franca Bettoia and Guy Madison.Goble p.939 It was made as a co-production between Italy and West Germany.

Brown entered what was already a crowded mayoral field in late October of 1997, instantly becoming the race's frontrunner. A poll published in The Montclarion right before he formally entered the race had showed Brown garnering 47% in a hypothetical race. Brown identified himself to be an independent, having declared himself to have left the Democratic Party. Brown ran under the campaign slogan \\"Oaklanders First\\". He campaign actively, holding many events. Brown was endorsed by, among others, former Berkeley, California mayor Gus Newport. Brown was the only white candidate running in the race. Oakland was a majority minority city. Brown won a majority of the black vote. Brown was heavily anticipated to win the election. While Oakland had a weak mayor form of government, Brown was also campaigning to change this. He supported Measure X, a measure on the ballot in November of 1998 which would change the city's model of government to a strong mayor for a period of 6 years. Ultimately, in November, Oakland's electorate voted by a landslide margin of 3 to 1 in support of Measure X, switching the city to a strong mayor system of governance prior to Brown taking office. Years later, in 2004, a referendum permanently extending Measure X later was passed, after failing to pass in 2002, making permanent the city's shift to the strong mayor model of governance.

It does this either via desktop virtualization, platform virtualization, or emulation via compatibility layer.  Desktop virtualization  Desktop virtualization apps are the least resource and space intensive compared to other virtualization types, since the Operating System that is being displayed on the Android device is actually located on another computer on the local network or elsewhere like on the internet. Depending upon how the desktop virtualization app works, they use RDP or can use another protocol of their own. Most business oriented desktop virtualization apps require specific types of equipment or services in order for the app to fully function. For example, VMware Horizon Client requires specific VMware equipment for the app to work. A major downside that desktop virtualization apps have compared to other types of virtualization or emulation technologies is that they require a network connection to the server as stated previously above.  Platform virtualization  Platform virtualization allows more leverage to the developer as anything that relates to the guest operating system only affects the guest operating system, and not the host operating system. Due to this it is possible for the guest operating system to be rooted, where as the host operating system remains unrooted. Due to the nature of platform virtualization and the fact that it can virtualize a rooted guest OS, it has a greater advantage over emulators as it can run applications or utilize packages that require access to the underlying system itself. As with all platform virtualization software and applications, they take up a lot of resources of the host in order to do the virtualization.  Emulation  = Types of emulations =  Emulation of other operating systems  Emulation of other operating systems on Android require the usage of some form of compatibility layer, where the compatibility layer must utilize some form of technologies or APIs to run the OS inside of the app container. This does come with limitations as some emulators utilize PRoot which is a chroot like environment. Unlike terminal emulators that emulate the internal OS with/without any extension package support, it can install actual (for example) Ubuntu packages, as it does not rely too much on the Android system limitations. However, not all packages and applications can run.  Terminal emulation of internal operating system  Terminal emulation of the Android device itself is done via either an actual local loopback to the device, or an emulation that seems to be a local loopback. Most of these terminal emulations of the device itself utilize the native terminal Toybox toolchain's library and functions that come with every android device. However due to the fact that the majority of the functions that are readily available without utilizing a compatibility layer, means that Toybox functions can only be utilized. In order for a user to add any other functions or libraries would require the user to root their own device and add the functions or libraries manually. Some of these terminal emulators allow users to enter Toybox commands implicitly, where those that don't require the usage of \\"toybox COMMAND\\". = With enhancements via semi-emulation = Some terminal emulators like Termux allow users to add packages. This is done via semi- emulating a different environment via the usage of PRoot and/or Toybox in the back-end. With the semi-emulating, some predefined ported packages can be used and installed without the need of rooting the device, as they do not utilize Android system files, and reside and run in the apps' own data containers and directories. Because Toybox is used mostly in the back-end, it depends on how the app was developed, for Toybox to be accessed from the semi-emulated enhanced terminal. = Extensions = Many emulators of other OSes allow the use of extensions. Aside from the use of standard SSH, some emulators allow the use of technologies like VNC and XSDL. Via the use of these extensions, the user can have the emulated/virtualized OS running in an desktop-like environment.  Limitations  The majority of limitations are seen in emulation-based apps rather than the platform virtualization based apps, as the emulation apps must utilize a compatibility layer. Thus for libraries and packages to work as expected like in a real OS, the compatibility layer must work properly and must be able to provide accurate information. However, this requires that the compatibility layer or any predefined software it uses (ex. Docker) to have access to many types of system- and device-related information. This can either be done via Toybox or programing language libraries that Android apps can be made from (e.g., Java, C#). However, starting with Android 8, many new security restrictions have been placed on apps; due to these restrictions, some API libraries/classes are no longer available or have been replaced by more restrictive API libraries/classes. One of the known limitations that was implemented is that apps can only natively access only their own sandbox root directory or sub-directories on an SD card. Apps wanting to access files or folders outside that on the SD card, are required to use Android's own system file selector. Due to this limitation, guest OSes running on, emulation, platform virtualization, or compatibility apps are no longer allowed to access files outside of their own SD card Sandbox. The majority of these limitations can be bypassed by rooting the Android device. However, utilizing Linux via utilizing an emulator or virtualization app would be redundant at that point as one could turn the device itself into a Linux environment. = OS internal security enhancements = More modern versions of Android have been seen having more internal system security enhancements, such that some system folders and files are no longer accessible or even viewable for that directory's existence. Versions of Android before 9 allowed terminal apps to view Android's root \\"/\\" directory (although not allowing modifications or execution).  SELinux  Android utilizes SELinux; due to this, all system configuration files are not editable and some are not even readable. Thus, apps can only utilize Android API's to learn about the device's or system's configuration or settings. However, not all information is available to apps; due to this, many OS compatibility layers or emulation apps are not able to run every package or application. Here are some known applications and packages that are unable to run: * Udisks2 requires udev which does not work well in most compatibility layer environments, as stated in the sub-sub-section below. * Snort * Open vSwitch * mininet (requires open vSwitch to run) Here are some commands that do not work, due to SELinux: * ip link show ADB, PRoot, $HOME and $PREFIX usage Because all Android apps run in a non-privileged container space, the virtualization or emulation apps must utilize their own app space to do the virtualization or emulation. This can be done either by ADB, PRroot, or the usage of $HOME and $PREFIX, however majority of these three are utilized by emulation apps as platform virtualization apps usually use different methods. Each of these is used for a different purpose. ADB is used for the emulation of a terminal-like environment for the entire Android system, but usually as an unprivileged user. $HOME and $PREFIX can be using $HOME as \\"~\\" and $PREFIX for \\".\\". However, $HOME can not be set outside of the \\"/data/apps data space\\" directory on the Android file system, nor can $PREFIX be moved to another place like the SD Card. For emulators or compatibility layers to emulate or virtualize a Linux-based OS on Android, PRoot must be used. However, when PRoot is used, the environment inside of Proot can act like a Chroot environment, and/or a separate mounted environment. In this scenario (especially in the case of compatibility layer and emulator for Guest OSes), there are packages and applications that can not run as they were never designed to run inside a chroot like environment. Some of these are well known, prominent packages, applications, or commands, including the following: * Systemd * Libudev (Works along side with Systemd). * Init * Mutter (software) relies upon systemd = Alternatives = Due to the issue of SeLinux and PRoot, alternatives must be used and not all of the unusable packages or applications have alternatives. Being an alternative, they don't necessarily have all the functions of the original packages or applications. Some of these alternatives include: * Eudev * Elogind * Metacity (Predecessor of Mutter) =Android itself being a modified Linux kernel= Because Android is a modified Linux kernel, not all configuration or system files exist or are the same in Android. Because of this, emulation apps either need to provide either their own version of the configuration or system files in the application's data space, use a pre-modified distribution of ported Linux libraries that do not require the usage of the missing configuration or system files, or not support the usage of those packages. Some well known configuration and system files that are not in Android include: * /etc/resolv.conf  See also  * Comparison of OS emulation or virtualization apps on Android * Virtualization  References  Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Virtualization software Category:Emulation software ","title":"OS virtualization and emulation on Android"},{"id":"62275960","text":"Brigid is a feminine given name, of which Bridget is a later variation.

JP then tells Bheeshma's father, Anand Prasad, that Bheeshma is serving a punishment with Deva and the flashback is that Anand and Deva were classmates and Bheeshma touched his daughter when they were little causing a split between both of them. Bheeshma starts off by cleaning and serving tea to the officers. One day, Bheeshma is driving and after he drops off Deva, on the way back he sees that Chaitra needs assistance as her vehicle got into a crash. He introduces to her as ACP Bheeshma as he is in a cop car and she introduces herself as an employee of Bheeshma Organics. He decides to go with her and he ends up learning about organic farming. Then the CEO of Field Science, Raghavan, introduces a product called Instant which produces a 6-month yield in 4 months by the use of chemicals and tries to influence some of Bheeshma's farmers by setting up a live interaction with Bheeshma.

Bheeshma decides to tell Deva the truth but to his surprise Sr. Bheeshma announces him as an operational CEO of the company for 30 days. Bheeshma is shocked by this decision and Chaitra despises him even more. He also found out that Parimal lost his job at Field Science due to Raghavan learning that Parimal is Bheeshma's friend and he joins as a driver for Bheeshma. Bheeshma is then shown around the office and he quickly wins over the employees. He also saves a village from signing from Field Science angering Raghavan which also rewins the love Chaitra. Raghavan decides to make sure Bheeshma is not the next CEO by giving a poisonous hybrid plant to Sr. Bheeshma which then hospitalizes him and to become India's #1 agricultural company and also plants chemically made plants in Bheeshma's warehouse to further make the company lose reputation with a police raid. Raghavan invites Agricultural Minister, Ajay Varma, to launch Instant to the world but to his surprise Ajay says that the product is made harmful chemicals and cancels the license of Field Science which confines Raghavan to bed. He soon finds out that Sr. Bheeshma is alive and he was only hospitalized due to a high fever. He also learns that Bheeshma found Sarah and Ajay in a hotel room and says that he has a pen camera and button cameras which forces Ajay to give a speech about how the chemicals are bad and how the police found out about him planting the plants.

The synagogue was built 1884‚Äì1885 on the Gr√ºnestra√üe (Green Street), now Wojska Polskiego Street, but was destroyed in 1938 during the Nazi Kristallnacht anti-Jewish pogrom.  History  The synagogue was built on the initiative of the Progressive Jews, according to the plans of architect Albert Grau (1837‚Äì1900) of Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw), a student of Georg Gottlob Ungewitter, in the style of the Neo- Moorish and Brick-neo-Gothic. From 1742 K≈Çodzko was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, then Germany, until Silesia became Polish under border changes promulgated at the 1945 Potsdam Conference. During the November Pogrom (9 November 1938), termed \\"Kristallnacht\\" in German Nazi propaganda, the synagogue was destroyed in an arson attack by German Nazi gangs.  Memory  Reinhard Schindler, a former Glatz citizen, developed the idea of having a memorial stone placed for the synagogue. The memorial stone was erected in 1995 with an anodised aluminum plaque in Polish, Hebrew and German commemorating the destroyed synagogue. The inscription reads: :Here stood the Glatz synagogue, desecrated and burned by the Nazis in the Pogrom Night of November 9, 1938. Former German and current Polish citizens in 1995 ‚Äì 50 years after the end of the war.  Sculpture  K≈Çodzko Synagogue cast-aluminium sculpture; view from south In the years 2015‚Äì2016, the German sculptor of Darmstadt created a sculpture of the synagogue made of cast aluminium weighing approx. . The collected materials, plans and sketches, together with photos and a description of the burning of the temple, was published as a book by Roese under the title: Decalogue on Fire. The artistic work under the same title includes the sculpture of the synagogue, a sculpture of the Ten Commandments above the portal, and a sculpture of one of the cast-iron gallery columns that collapsed during the fire in its rubble and ash bed. In addition, fifteen 1 √ó 1 meter (3.3 √ó 3.3 foot) large panels of photographs by G√ºnter Veit and a synagogue with a fragment of a Torah scroll, probably stolen in Poland by a member of the Wehrmacht. In May 2018, Roese brought the entire work to K≈Çodzko with the help of a group of young people and donated it to the city. The sculpture and other materials from the exhibition of Roese were also in 2018 in the project Topography of Terror installed in Berlin and published in a catalog.  Synagogue Revival  Gerhard Roese presents a sculpture of the synagogue in the Museum of the K≈Çodzko Land. Photo by Tomasz Gmerek On the anniversary of the Reichsprogromnacht, also Kristallnacht on November 8, 2018, the (Museum of the K≈Çodzko Land), together with the sculptor from Darmstadt and the Polish activists Micha≈Ç Cyprys, Henryk Grzybowski, Mieczys≈Çaw Kowalcze and Grzegorz Sadowski, hosted an event commemorating the terror of 80 years ago and the former Jewish community under the motto Synagoga Reviva. Gerhard Roese talked about his idea and implementation of the sculpture model of the synagogue. Students from various schools in K≈Çodzko and a group of adults participated. They learned what is known about the structure and its destruction today, as well as that of two surviving ladies, Ruth Prager and Shoshana Efrati, who had visited the synagogue in their childhood. Henryk Grzybowski told about their fate from former Glatz, to Chile and Israel. After a small concert with Yiddish and Hebrew songs performed by Sylwia Grzybowska, those in attendance went to the synagogue memorial stone and lit candles.  Commemorative plaque  On January 26, 2019, a commemorative plaque with content in three languages was stolen from its stone. On March 22, 2019, a new stone tablet financed from contributions from the community of K≈Çodzko and former German residents was unveiled.

Development Judgement Silversword was created by independent Japanese designer \\"M-KAI\\". It was programmed using the WonderWitch, a software development kit produced by Qute that allowed consumers to produce homebrew software for the WonderSwan hardware family using C+ language. To promote the kit's release, Qute held a contest where programmers had to use it to make a game for the system, the winners having their games published as official releases. Judgement Silversword was one of the winning games, alongside M-KAI's sister project Cardinal Sins, both of which Qute published in Japan. Development lasted roughly a month and a half. The game is believed to be inspired by Treasure's 1998 arcade game Radiant Silvergun. M-KAI released Judgement Silversword as a freeware demo on his personal website in 2001. The retail version was released by Qute on February 2, 2004 with the subtitle Rebirth Edition - due to Bandai discontinuing the WonderSwan family a year prior, Qute produced a limited print run of 500 copies, making it one of the rarest WonderSwan games released and commanding high prices in the second hand market. The 2011 Xbox 360 game Eschatos includes both Judgement Silversword and Cardinal Sins as extras. The original was digitally re-released for Windows via Steam in 2018, under the title Judgement Silversword - Resurrection. Reception Copies sold out within just a few hours of being made available, leading to Qute reissuing it due to fan demand. French publication Pocket Gamer said that the game justified the purchase of the console, praising its colorful, detailed visuals, originality and fast-paced gameplay. They also liked the game's lack of slowdown and smooth sprite animation, alongside its various different difficulty options. In retrospect, Hardcore Gamer said that the large amount of levels and impressive graphical effects made Judgement Silversword a \\"technologic marvel\\" for the WonderSwan Color. Retro Gamer had a similar response, being impressed with the game's colorful visuals, intense gameplay and the ability to save high scores, adding that it was a good alternative to Radiant Silvergun. IGN expressed interest in the game being ported to the Nintendo DSi, saying that it could help establish a certain amount of quality for similar games available for both the DSi and the Wii Virtual Console.

The first two Chinese characters in the title, cheong-gu (ÈùëÈÇ±), literally mean green hills and are another name for Korea. The last two Chinese characters of the title, yadam (ÈáéË´á), refer to relatively short stories that were enjoyed in the men's quarters of a household during the Joseon Dynasty. The book has been subject to a number of scholarly analyses.  Overview  = Origin = While it is estimated that Cheong-gu yadam was written during the 19th century, the author is unknown. There are theories, however, that Kim Kyeong-jin (ÈáëÊï¨Èé≠), a vassal of the late Joseon period, is responsible for publishing the stories. = Content = Because Cheong-gu yadam comprises so many diverse stories, it is hard to summarize the entire collection. But in general, the stories can be divided into three main categories: stories about gaining riches, stories about love between a man and a woman, and stories about individuals who are social pariahs or have questionable character. Yeongsaneopbuburibang (ÁáüÁî£Ê•≠Â§´Â©¶Áï∞Êàø A Couple Who Slept in Separate Rooms to Gain Riches) is one example of a story about gaining riches. In the story, a poor old bachelor named Kim gets married, and on the first night of their marriage, he and his wife resolve to become rich. Thinking that they will never become rich if they have a child now, the couple spend ten years sleeping in separate rooms. They devote themselves to farming and eventually become extremely rich. While it might seem somewhat cold that a couple would sleep in separate rooms for 10 years just to get rich, one can also read in this story the strong desire by the people of that time to find fortune and escape poverty. Gwonsamunpiubonggiyeon (Ê¨äÊñØÊñáÈÅøÈõ®ÈÄ¢Â•áÁ∑£ Avoiding the Rain, and Having an Odd Connection) is one example of a story about love between a man and a woman. In this story, a man named Kwon hides from the rain under the eaves of a random house then becomes intimate with the young widow living in the house. Later, the reader finds out that the young widow's father-in-law orchestrated the encounter because he pitied the plight of the young widow, who knew nothing of the sexual union of men and women. Although the Joseon Dynasty is famous for its strong feudalistic moral code, this story shows that, at the same time, sexual desires were accepted as essential and normal. Eosojangtoaseolbugaek (Ë™ûÊ∂àÈï∑ÂÅ∏ÂÖíË™™ÂØåÂÆ¢ The Rich Man of Yeongnam Who Was Robbed) is one example of a story about a social pariah or individual of questionable character. In this story, a wealthy man of Yeongnam is looking for the opportunity to become connected with an influential family from Seoul and move up in the world. Then one day, the leader of a band of thieves of Weolchuldo pretends to be the nephew of a government official and asks to spend the night, and the rich man gladly welcomes the thief into his home. That night, while kindly advising the rich man that his efforts to become affiliated with a family of influence are in vain, the thief steals all of the rich man's fortune. From this depiction of the thief as a valiant hero, the reader can sense that the work takes a negative and critical view of corrupt government officials and the immoral rich people. = Characteristics and Significance = While Cheong-gu yadam is written in Hanmun, or Chinese characters, the sentences are plain and frequently use Korean proverbs and Korean vocabulary. In addition to this, because the subject matter of the stories is generally intimately concerned with life at the time, it is possible to understand the dynamic lives of the people who lived at the time these stories were written. In particular, along with Lee Hui-jun's Gyeseo yadam (Ê∫™Ë•øÈáéË´á Tales from Gyeseo) and Lee Won-myeong's Dongyahuijib (Êù±ÈáéÂΩôËºØ Tales from the Eastern Plains), Cheong-gu yadam is considered as one of the three most important collections of yadam of the Joseon Dynasty. This is because the yadam recorded in Cheong-gu yadam are not only numerous, but literary as well.  Editions  There are 17 editions of Cheong-gu yadam. Included below are the main editions for Cheong-gu yadam. Of these editions, the Cheong-gu yadam held at University of California, Berkeley has the most entries and is the most complete. * University of California, Berkeley: 10 volumes, 10 books, 290 stories * Kyujanggak (Hangeul Version): 19 volumes, 10 books, 262 stories * Dongyangmungo: 8 volumes, 8 books, 266 stories * Seoul National University Old Books Collection: 5 volumes, 5 books, 217 stories  Further reading  1\\\\.

Beginning in 1670 Bombay began to be developed as a shipyard and by 1686 Bombay had become the headquarters of the English East India Company and its fleet in India was renamed the Bombay Marine.Day, pp.56‚Äì61. To support the Bombay Marine a refit yard was built with a supporting shore organisation consisting of a marine storekeeper, Mr. William Minchen, who was appointed in 1670 and a master shipbuilder Mr. Warwick Pett. The structure followed that of other Royal Navy Dockyards such as those in England where in the early 17th century the naval storekeeper and master shipwright were key posts.Day. pp.58. The development in the administrative structure was notable for the combination of shore and ship establishments.Day. p.58. In 1735 by the East India Company, brought in shipwrights from their base at Surat in order to construct vessels using Malabar teak. One of their number, Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia, was (along with several generations of his descendants) a key figure in the success of the Yard, as indicated in The New Cambridge History of India: Science, Technology and Medicine in Colonial IndiaArnold, David (2004), The New Cambridge History of India: Science, Technology and Medicine in Colonial India, pp. 101-102, Cambridge University Press, . In 1742 a post of Superintendent of the Bombay Marine was created along with a Commodore, Bombay Marine and seven other commanders. The superintendent controlled the dockyard with the commodore reporting to him, a purser of the marine being in charge of accounts, a master builder, and storekeeper in charge of their departments.Day. pp.58‚Äì59. Additionally in 1742 a Bombay Marine Board was established to administrate the dockyard consisting of the superintendent, the commodore and two senior captains as the facilities customers, and the superintendent‚Äôs deputy, the master attendant.Day. p. 59. In the first decade of the 19th century the Department of Admiralty in London gradually took over responsibility for the yard, and day to administration of the yard passed from the superintendent to the Navy Boards, Resident Commissioner, Bombay, who continued working with the Wadia family as Master Shipwrights. There was much construction on the site around this time. Duncan Dock, which was the largest dry dock outside Europe at the time, was constructed in 1807‚Äì1810, and remains in use today.

These dates reveal an anomaly in jazz at the time: The recordings are the place on the map where jazz and R&B; meet head on, bringing the full force of their respective traditions and neither giving an inch. And it works so well ... Cannonball is excellent throughout; the R&B; and blues idioms are all meat and potatoes for him, and he feels confident settling inside the groove without the need to push the boundary. Ironically, it's Vinson who compensates in that way. And the anchor in all of this is Zawinul, leading the rhythm section, condensing both musics to their most essential harmonics and tonalities, and building them out with a swinging style and cadence that are nothing short of remarkable ... Highly recommended\\".

An authority on international air and space law, he served as professor and dean of the University College London Faculty of Laws and honorary president of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law. He was a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society and an honorary fellow at UCL. He was named an officier of the Ordre des Palmes Academiques by the French government and awarded the Santos-Dumont Merit Medal by the Brazilian government.  Life and career  Bin Cheng (or Zheng Bin) was born in 1921 in the Republic of China, with his ancestral home in Zhongshan, Guangdong. He was the son of Cheng Tien-hsi (F. T. Cheng), a jurist and diplomat who served as a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice and as the last ambassador of the Republic of China to the United Kingdom from 1946 to 1950. Cheng earned a Licence-en-droit degree from the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1944. He obtained a Ph.D. in law in 1950 and an LL.D. in 1966, both from University College London (UCL). Cheng was professor of Air and Space Law at UCL from 1967 to 1986, and was emeritus professor afterwards. From 1971 to 1973, he served as dean of the UCL Faculty of Laws. In 2008, he was named honorary president of the London Institute of Space Policy and Law (ISPL).  Contributions  An authority on international air and space law, Cheng has been described as the \\"Father of International Air Law\\". During the height of the Cold War in the 1960s, Cheng investigated the United Nations General Assembly's resolutions 1721 A (December 1961) and 1962 (December 1963) regarding legal principles governing the outer space. He invented the theory of instant customary law, which states that opinio juris is the only necessary element for the creation of a new customary international law, which may be created \\"over night\\" as long as opinio juris about its existence is not rejected by member states of the international community. This theory has gained support over time. According to the ISPL, Cheng's 1953 book, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals, is considered the most important treatment of the subject. He also published the books The Law of International Air Transport (1962) and Studies in International Space Law (1997). The latter reprints his pioneering articles on international air and space law. In 2017, Cheng donated his collection of more than 3,000 books and legal documents to Northwest University of Politics and Law (NWUPL) in Xi'an, China, and NWUPL established the Bin Cheng Air and Space Law Library and the Cheng Tien-Hsi International Law Library in the memory of Cheng and his father.

The film starred Harihar Sharma as the eponymous character, with Shakuntala Sharma, Subhadra Adhikari, Krishna Malla, Sharmila Malla and director Shah himself in supporting roles, while Madan Krishna Shrestha and Hari Bansha Acharya were credited as guest actors. While the film was a critical and commercial success, it was criticised by some for its departure from the source material; Dhruba Chandra Gautam expressed disappointment at the film for being markedly different from the script he had written for the film. Neer Shah has conceded that various artistic compromises were made for commercial reasons which he came to regret later on. He is said to be actively planning a remake. The film was produced by industrialist Binod Chaudhary. The film's musical score was composed by veteran musician Ranjit Gazmer. It was the debut film of comedian and actor Rajaram Paudel. The song Yatri from the film, adapted from the eponymous poem by Nepali poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota, was highly acclaimed upon its release and remains popular. Plot Basudev Kattel (Harihar Sharma) is a professor in Kathmandu struggling to make ends meet. When his friend Kumar (Neer Shah) asks that he help him on his illegal business scheme in return for lending him money, their relationship grows strained. Basudev and Kumar continue to insult each other for their respective values, when among mutual friends, arguing the merits of financial well-being against a principled life. The relationship gets worse when Kumar finds out that his only daughter Sangita (Sharmila Shah) is dating Prem (Krishna Malla), Basudev's son. Kumar initially attempts to convince Basudev to join his illegal business activities in order to bring the latter's economic status on par with his own as a precondition for marrying his daughter into Basudev's family. When both Basudev and Prem decline, Kumar gets Basudev fired from his job. Basudev's youngest son is diagnosed with a kidney ailment that requires he be treated in India. Prem and Sangita manage the funds for the treatment with contribution from friends and family and leave for Delhi with the sick boy. Unable to come to terms with his daughter leaving home for Prem, a drunk Kumar goes to Basudev's house where he tries to rape Basudev's daughter and when intervened by Basudev's elderly father and Sabitri, physically assaults both. Basudev, learning what had happened, vows to end it once and for all, and breaks into Kumar's house, where he attacks Kumar from behind and kills him strangling him with his tie. Basudev walks into the night and dies of an apparent heart attack at his favourite stop in the city.

According to director Shah, Basudev was the first film to be made from a domestically produced script. The film scripts were, until then, written by Bollywood writers. Neer Shah, having a strong belief that the way to uplift Nepali cinema was to build stories and scripts from Nepali writers themselves, decided to make such a film himself. He chose an already popular Nepali book Kattel Sarko Chotpatak to adapt from. The script for the film was written by the book's author Dhruba Chandra Gautam himself, in collaboration with Neer Shah, while the comedic bits were contributed to by Hari Bansha Acharya. The film was produced with investment from industrialist Binod Chaudhary, credited as the producer of the film, who, according to Shah, agreed to invest after the latter had given him a copy of the book to read. The film began its principal photography in 1982. According to director Shah, the Information Department had delivered damaged raw stocks which compromised the quality of filming. As the first Nepali film to be shot in 16 mm, which needed to be converted to 35 mm, the damaged raw stock severely hampered the video. The popular song Yatri adapted from the eponymous poem by Laxmi Prasad Devkota was recorded in Mumbai, sung by Rabin Sharma. The production budget of the film was Rs 1.4 Million. Rs 350 thousand was invested by Neer Shah, another 350 thousand was borrowed from Shah's friends and the remaining 700 thousand was invested by Binod Chaudhary.  Release  According to director Shah, the film had trouble getting approved by the Censor Board which was very strict during the Panchayat regime. The film was released to theatres in 1984. Neer Shah has said that Binod Chaudhary was unenthusiastic about the final cut of the film, further speculating that the latter might have not finished the book before agreeing to produce the film. Dhruba Chandra Gautam was initially reported to have been disappointed with the liberties director Shah had taken with his script, but according to later accounts, he was more appreciative, acknowledging the different nature of a film medium to a written word, and concluding that it was a good work for the medium and the time. Reception and legacy Upon release Basudev emerged to be one of the successful, and the most recognized film of Neer Shah. The film is also considered \\"one of the best examples of realistic Nepali cinema and marked a turning point towards film that raised awareness of social issues\\". Bibash Basti, for Annapurna Post Today in 2017, wrote that the film had stirred Nepali society and widened the \\"filmy-canvass\\". Released in the 1980s, the golden years of Nepali cinema, it is considered one of the best films of that decade. The characters Basudev and Sabitri played by Harihar Sharma and Shakuntala Sharma respectively, have been well-received, and the actors who are married in real life were still seen as an exemplary couple almost 30-years after the film's release. Planned remake Director Neer Shah has acknowledged that the film was not as good as the book. He has said that he was pressured to add song and dance, romantic scenes between Krishna Malla and Sharmila Shah as well as action sequences involving Krishna Malla to make it more marketable to a general audience, contrary to his own artistic choices as a director. He has said that he is working on a remake that will be truer to his own vision.

It was released on October 11, 2019, by STX Lionheart and distributed by Genie Music. Having released a ballad record earlier in the year, Jung wanted to further his transition from an idol to a singer-songwriter and \\"all-rounder solo artist\\". He conceived the genre, concept, and ambiance of the project, which culminated into a dance album. Following a series of photo and video teasers, Aight and its lead single of the same name were concurrently released. Jung held a showcase for the single album and he promoted the song by performing it on music chart programs across various television networks. Aight peaked at number 15 on South Korea's national Gaon Album Chart, shifting over 4,600 units domestically since its release. Background and music structure Jung signed with STX Lionheart in June 2019, two months after releasing his debut mini-album Chapter2 \\"27\\" and accompanying ballad lead single. With Aight, he wanted to synchronize dance, music, and performance, which led him to re-adopt his B.A.P image and concept as a dance singer. Jung decided on the album's genre, concept, and ambiance. Seeking to develop his musical spectrum, Jung engaged in rap, performance, lyrics, and composition. He took interest in rapping as a result of being surrounded by rappers and decided to take lessons of the technique. Jung described his vocals on previous albums with his group as containing \\"many high notes\\", contrasting it with the newly recorded music that is \\"easier to listen to\\". The record further demonstrates his transition from an idol to a singer-songwriter and \\"all-rounder solo artist\\". The title Aight is an English slang word for \\"alright\\" used to express a positive sentiment. A dance album, it opens with the title track, a newtro funk and dance song. It incorporates a \\"rhythmical\\" bassline, a funky guitar, and synthesizers. The lyrics revolve around a woman the narrator loves. It was penned by Kim Ki-beom, who had previously worked with Jung when writing songs for B.A.P. The single's choreography was conceived by choreographer Waackxxxy and Jung, which consists of waacking, slow motion, and dancing which simulates zero-gravity walking on an alien planet. The song was re-recorded and choreography modified three times each. On the second track, Jung contributed to the songwriting of \\"Bomb\\". It expresses his message of energy and consolation to workers who face an onslaught of work. Jung began crafting the song prior to working on Aight and, finding inspiration from his fans, he intended to dedicate a \\"bright\\" song to them. Artwork concept The cover art concept of Aight is outer space. The theme was chosen to liken the size of space to Jung's musical capacity. It compromises illustrations of rockets, airplanes, and planets set against a mint-colored gradient background. It also includes an Iris flower which stands for \\"the only love\\", a rabbit that symbolizes B.A.P's fandom, fireworks which signify the celebration of a new beginning, and a flock of birds that represent his fans. Jung is portrayed as an astronaut wearing a pink spacesuit, which replicates the color of his Kekemato bunny mascot from B.A.P. The suit contains a depiction of Ganji, Jung's pet Bichon Frise. It also bears the numbers \\"2-1\\" which denote part one of his second chapter as a soloist and the letters \\"J/L\\" for Jung Dae-hyun and Lionheart. The album photography was shot my Moke Na-jung. It shows Jung with a \\"natural\\" look, which he described as \\"mostly dreamy and fantasy-like\\". Release and promotion Jung during an Aight album signing event, October 20, 2019 On September 27, STX Lionheart issued a promotion schedule leading up to the release of Jung's first single album Aight. Seven concept photos were simultaneously released September 30, with an additional six on the consecutive day. A highlight medley of the record was uploaded on October 4. An initial music video teaser was published on October 7, followed by a second two days later. Directed by Lee Gi-baek, the music video for the lead single \\"Aight\\" was posted on October 11 at midnight. The eponymous single album was released twelve hours later. One day prior to the release of Aight, Jung held a showcase for the single album at the MUV Hall in the Mapo District in Seoul. He also began promoting \\"Aight\\" that day. He performed the single on Mnet's M Countdown. Jung made additional performances on Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's (MBC) Show! Music Core, SBS MTV's The Show, and MBC Music's Show Champion. He also made appearances on radio shows SBS Power FM's Cultwo Show and MBC Standard FM's Idol Radio to promote the album. Jung concluded promotions for the record on November 2.

The town is known for its well-preserved city walls that surround the city, and is the only castle town in Taiwan where all of the original gates remain standing. It is protected as a national historical site.  History  During the Qing dynasty, the area that is modern-day Hengchun was governed as part of Fengshan County. However, being a distant and sparsely populated region, the Qing found it hard to govern the area. Things took a turn following the Rover incident and the Mudan incident, causing the Qing government to decide to maintain a stronger presence in the area. Shen Baozhen, originally dispatched to Hengchun after the Mudan incident, suggested that a fort be built in the area and named it \\"Hengchun\\", meaning \\"constantly spring\\", referring to the region's fair weather. Construction ran between 1875 and 1879 and was designed by Liu Ao, who would later design the Walls of Taipei. When completed, Hengchun became the seat of the newly-founded Hengchun County. Since its founding, the fort was damaged multiple times. An typhoon in 1908 caused severe damage to the wooden gatehouses, and large parts of the walls were further damaged during World War Two and the 1959 Hengchun earthquake. Additionally, parts of the wall were removed to construct roads, leaving only portions of the wall near the north and east gates still standing. The castle was first protected as a national historical site in 1979, and the Tourism Bureau began repairs to the south and east gates in 1979 and 1986, respectively, including building replica gatehouses above both gates. However, termites in the east gatehouse caused it to collapse again.  Structure  A stretch of castle wall between the north and west gates. The original fort contained four gates, one in each cardinal direction (except the west gate, which faced northwest). Each gate featured a gatehouse and cannons. The southern gate was named the \\"Mingdu Gate\\" (ÊòéÈÉΩÈñÄ), while the remaining gates were left unnamed. The walls were 2.6 km long and surrounded the entire town, which was then surrounded by a moat. Within the walls, civilians typically resided near the south and west gates, while a military barrack occupied the northern half of the town. Currently, while all four gates remain standing, only portions of the wall remain near the north and east gates. The south gate sits within a roundabout on the town's major thoroughfare.

He currently holds the Joint Chair in European Public Policy at the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies and the Department of Political and Social Sciences of the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Before joining the EUI, he was a professor of political science at Jacobs University Bremen, Germany, and a research associate at the Max-Planck-Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne, Germany.  Research interest  Philipp Genschel‚Äôs work revolves around three broad topics: taxation, European integration and governance theory. His early research focused on the international political economy of taxation. He asked why taxation is so relatively resilient to international cooperation, analyzed the logic of international tax competition, and reconstructed the evolution of the European and the global tax regime. Jointly with Laura Seelkopf, he has recently compiled a ‚ÄòTax Introduction Dataset‚Äô that lists the date of the first permanent introduction of six major taxes (including the personal income tax and the VAT) in 220 jurisdictions worldwide, 1750-2018. In joint work with Markus Jachtenfuchs, Genschel has analyzed the European integration of ‚Äòcore state powers‚Äô, i.e. of the three key resources of sovereign government: money, coercive power and public administration. They show that the integration of these powers (for instance in EMU or Schengen) is associated with the institutional fragmentation, territorial differentiation and political segmentation of the EU: ‚Äòmore integration, less federation‚Äô. Purportedly, this outcome reflects specific features of core state powers including high political salience, and high propensity for zero-sum conflict. Together with Kenneth W. Abbott, Duncan Snidal and Bernhard Zangl, Genschel has explored the agency of international organizations. More specifically, they analyzed how IOs ‚Äòorchestrate‚Äô the voluntary cooperation of NGOs, transgovernmental networks and other third parties to leverage their power and gain autonomy from their member state principals. Based on this work, they critically engage with principal-agent theory and compare orchestration to other modes of indirect governance including delegation, cooptation and trusteeship.

Early life  Wallace was born in a remote area of Central Australia and her family kept her away from stations and missions to prevent her removal under the Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 Act. When she was 13. her family was forced to move to Santa Teresa Mission, now Ltyentye Apurte Community. This move was caused by severe drought and the interruption of traditional hunting and food gathering by encroaching station activities.  Career  Wallace has lived on her homelands her whole life and she has always viewed it as her responsibility to ensure traditional knowledge is handed on; especially through art and storytelling. In 1989 she was a founding member of Keringke Arts and, since then, has become one of their most successful artists and her work is represented in many national and international collections. Her artworks are very influenced by her catholic faith and she says: In October 2019 the stained glass window that Wallace designed was installed at the Our Lady of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Alice Springs which is celebrated for showing the blending of Catholic and Indigenous beliefs. The title of the painting, which became the stained glass is Urtakwerte Atywerrenge Anthurre or, in English, Very Sacred Heart and it depicts the Virgin Mary and Jesus standing on a sandhill and different parts of the painting representing different aspects of her blended faith. She also was a senior advisor on the Indigemoji app. In addition to being an artist Wallace has worked as a teacher and served her community as an elected councillor for Ltyentye Apurte as well as being a member of the executive committee of Desart. Wallace and her husband Douglas had no children of their own but they have raised more than 30 children throughout their marriage; taking in children when they were neglected or their parents were drinking.

First published in 1993 in New Delhi by Kali for Women after a Norwegian organisation's grant of Rs 1.4 lakh, and later published by Zubaan (an imprint of Kali) and Verso, the illustrated book is \\"a brief interpretative history of women's movements in India from the beginning of the nineteenth century until the present day\\", as the first line of the introduction concisely conveys. Divided into 12 chapters and four other sections‚Äîdedication, acknowledgements, conclusion and index‚Äîthe original edition of the book spans 203 pages.Radha Kumar (1993). The History of Doing: Contents. Retrieved from GBV Common Library Network on 7 November 2019. The book can broadly be distinguished into two main parts, women in India during time of the British Empire and then the period after India gained independence. According to a book review in Socialist Review, \\"What makes the book more intriguing is the way it is broken up with copies of leaflets, reprints of posters, boxes with the life histories of some of the women involved and lots of pictures of activities.\\" The pictures of protesting women tells a story in itself and is a peek into \\"what the liberating power of mass activity means.\\" Tulsi Patel notes the same in the Sociological Bulletin about the visual anthropology in her review of the book, adding that the book is enriched by photographs, bills, debates and other issues put inside the boxes.  Description  Kumar raises important issues about the women's movement in India and the kind of issues the movement has taken up such as sati, child marriage, domestic violence, remarriage, girl education, rape, dowries, women in politics, health and environmental destruction as well as the directions and perspectives it has taken. She gives counter-arguments and differences to the claim that the women's movement in India is an unnecessary import from the West and also discuses the effect of population control and changes in the caste system on Indian women. Tulsi Patel, from the Department of Sociology in Jamia Milia Islamia, notes how the book surveys \\"campaigns, organizations and personalities in the light of the issues that become prominent in different contexts.\\" Bhikaji Cama with the Stuttgart flag, 1907. The image can be found on page 46 of the book. Kumar notes how during the 19th century India was flooded with social reform influences and internal change was taking place. The position of a woman in all aspects was being discussed; by men at the forefront too. Child marriage, the ban on the remarriage of widows, the practice of sati, girl education all needed addressing by society; and addressed they were. Landmark instances are elaborated such as that of Rakhmabai and her legal case of her marriage as a child bride; wherein she refused to obey the appeal courts decision against her in 1884, preferred paying the hefty fine and went on to become a doctor from England; after which she came back to India and continued practicing medicine. Another case elaborated on during the time of British rule is it that of the sharecroppers' movement in the 1940s where women in the thousands were active in the protests. She also notes how some women joined guerilla armies. She points out how things changed a lot after Independence. Women understood well that their needs and wants were not being taken notice of by lawmakers. The 1970s saw various women's movements like those against the sale of alcohol at village level and larger campaigns against sati, dowry deaths and rape. Kumar describes personal experiences such as the shock of coming face to face with an orthodox Hindu protest, with many women part of it, in favour of sati. Upasana Mahanta writes in the EPW that Radha Kumar's book \\"records the ways in which ordinary women rework traditional practices to their advantage negotiating \\"concessions\\" from husbands, families, communities and so on that were otherwise not accessible to them.\\" Since publication the book has been widely read and has become a part of syllabi readings for a PG Diploma Women's Empowerment, GGS Indraprastha University, as well as in the Women's Studies Centre for a PG Diploma in Women's Studies.(2015) Scheme of Examination & Syllabi.

It made the headlines when Justice Andrew Goodman of the Ontario Superior Court at trial ruled that the Act had effectively infringed on an indigenous defendant's Charter Rights under Section 7. The first Trudeau administration had meant the Act to redress the power of defendants to dismiss potential jurors as part of their peremptory challenge rights granted as early as 1215 in the Magna Charta document. This was perceived by the Trudeau administration as needless discrimination and thus, in the 21st-century scramble to equalize society, needed to be stricken from collective memory. The need to rectify the law had become apparent to Liberal watchers of the death of Colten Boushie as a result of his 9 August 2016 trespass on the farm of Gerald Stanley, when they perceived racism to be evident in Stanley's 9 February 2018 acquittal.

Biography Haas was born to a Jewish family in Reckendorf, Bavaria, one of nine children including brothers Charles A. (b. 1825) and Samuel (b. 1827), and sisters Flora, Johanna, Sophia, Babete, Lena, and Anna. He immigrated to New York at the age of 15 with his brothers where they peddled notions saving money to travel West. The brothers first worked as miners and seeing that there was more money in retailing began to sell goods to miners. In 1854, he moved to Portland, Oregon where he founded a grocery store. (His cousin, Abraham Haas, co-founder of the Hellman, Haas and Company ‚Äì which became Smart & Final ‚Äì began his career at the firm). In 1868, he moved to San Francisco, California and co-founded Loupe & Haas with his brother Charles and Leopold Loupe. In 1875, Loupe retired and their cousin William Haas (1849‚Äì1916) joined the firm which was renamed Haas Brothers. In 1875, there was a banking crisis in California due to a collapse in mining revenues and numerous banks closed including the Bank of California and Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles (founded by fellow Reckendorf- native Isaias W. Hellman whose brother Herman W. Hellman was partners with Kalman's cousin Abraham). As Haas Brothers was financially strong and the Hellman and Haas families were intertwined, Kalman announced that Farmers and Merchants Bank depositors could either redeem or transfer their accounts to Haas Brothers stores. The panic subsided and Kalman is widely credited with calming a moment that could have been disastrous; and both the Hellman and Haas families reaped the benefits of their efforts once the economy was restored. In 1886, he moved to New York where he served as the company's purchasing agent leaving the day-to-day operations to his cousin William as president and sons-in-law Leopold Klau and Carl Klau. Haas served as a director of the Mutual Alliance Trust Company. Haas Brothers exists today as one of the largest liquor distributors on the West Coast.

The Elphinstone lands were to the south and east of Stirling centred on the settlement of Elphinstone and Dunmore near the Forth. His neighbours included the Drummonds of Carnock and Bannockburn and the Bruces of Airth. His family were longstanding rivals of the Erskine Earls of Mar. Until his father's death in 1602, he was known as \\"Alexander, Master of Elphinstone\\". He joined the court of James VI as a gentleman of the bedchamber in October 1580.William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1574-1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 531. In May 1585 Margaret Haldane, the wife of David Erskine, Commendator of Dryburgh, was held at Kildrummy Castle in the custody of the Master of Elphinstone. Francis Walsingham, at the instance of her brother, wrote to Edward Wotton, an English diplomat in Edinburgh, to ask that she be moved to more congenial location.Joseph Bain, Hamilton Papers, vol. 2 (London, 1896), p. 643. In March 1592 he was involved in the aftermath of the murder of James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray, the \\"Bonny Earl of Murray\\", as a friend of the Earl of Huntly, a prisoner in Blackness Castle. Elphinstone and three lairds went to Linlithgow Palace to see Moray's mother, Margaret Campbell, Lady Castle, and offered her his bond of ¬£100,000 Scots that he would appear at court for his trial. The English ambassador Robert Bowes heard it was thought that Elphinstone would escort Huntly back to his home at Huntly Castle in the north.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 655 no. 669.

David Foster had been killed at Kirkliston by the Laird of Dunipace and young Laird of Airth on 24 June, and Mar had carried the body in a procession to Linlithgow and Stirling on 12 July with a painted banner showing the murder, which crossed his opponent's lands, leading to a tense situation. Walter Stewart of Blantyre and John Colville mediated in this quarrel. Colville believed that Anne of Denmark encouraged Elphinstone's faction against Mar, thinking that it would undermine's Mar's credibility as the keeper of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 625 no. 574, 635 no. 587, 636 no. 590, 639 no. 592: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 20 no. 19, 23 no. 22, 26 no.26, 29 no. 28, 33 no. 30.

Inventory of the Place of Elphinstone After Lord Elphinstone died in 1638, an inventory was taken of his possessions at the Place of Elphinston, or Elphinstone Tower, which had been sealed in a coffer. The goods included his best clothes with \\"ane auld silk beaver hatt out of fashion\\", his books including John Williams's Great Britain's Solomon and John Smith's The Description of New England. A little box contained frivolous writs and missives, there was a brass clock to stand on a table, and velvet, damask, and leather cushions. In the tower there was a wine decanter with seven glasses, a brass warming-pan, and two cabinets with more worthless legal documents. Above the entry to the inner courtyard, the \\"mid yett\\", there was an iron clock with paces. All these items were taken up to a chamber at the head of the turnpike stair at the east end of the gallery, and locked up by the Depute Sheriff of Stirling, Thomas Craigengelt of Craigengelt.HMC 9th Report: Lord Elphinstone (London, 1884), p. 194 no. 57.

The older one was built in 1913 in the Greater Kalemegdan section of the Belgrade Fortress and demolished by the occupying Austro-Hungarian forces in 1916 during World War I. The present monument was dedicated in 1979 on the Vraƒçar plateau.  1857 proposal  The idea for the monument to Karaƒëorƒëe, leader of the First Serbian Uprising from 1804 to 1813, appeared for the first time in 1853. At the time, autonomous Serbia was ruled by the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. Proposed location was Terazije, the central city square. First official proposal came in 1857, from Toma Vuƒçiƒá-Peri≈°iƒá, one of the leaders of the Defenders of the Constitution. Though the monument to the almost mythical hero was meant to homogenize the nation after centuries old Ottoman occupation, as one of the most powerful men in the state at the time, Vuƒçiƒá-Peri≈°iƒá wasn't much interested into celebrating the ruling dynasty, as ruling prince Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá was a ceremonial ruler. The idea for the monument was to be a symbol and clear message to the exiled ruling prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá (who organized assassination of Karaƒëorƒëe in 1817), from the opposing Obrenoviƒá dynasty which was replaced by the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty in 1842. Though Ottoman administration over Serbia was limited at the time, it was still strong enough to prevent building of the monument. They couldn't allow a memorial to the bitter enemy of their empire. After the Saint Andrew's Day Assembly in 1858‚Äì1859, dethroned Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá was restored to power and the idea of erecting a monument to Karaƒëorƒëe was abandoned.  1913 monument  ƒêorƒëe Petroviƒá Karaƒëorƒëe (1768-1817), leader of the First Serbian Uprising from 1804 to 1813 and progenitor of the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty which ruled Serbia and Yugoslavia 1842-1858 and 1903-1945 In 1903 the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty again came to the throne. The glorification of Karaƒëorƒëe was also restored and the idea of the monument resurfaced as, this time, Serbia was an independent state so the monument could be built. The memorial was envisioned as a strong propaganda and rhetoric tool for the newly reinstated dynasty. Propaganda was needed both due to the tragic occurrence by which the Obrenoviƒá dynasty was removed (bloody May Coup), and the ensuing decisive confrontation with the remains of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Ministry of War announced the design competition for the monument on 21 September 1908. The chosen location was the Great Kalemegdan section of the Kalemegdan Park, in the Belgrade Fortress. Propositions stipulated that the artists must be from Serbia, that monument has to be in the straightforward military-historical vein, and that Karaƒëorƒëe's appearance must be livelier and more imposing than the surrounding figures. Exhibition of the applied designs was organized in April 1909. First prize went to artist Pa≈°ko Vuƒçetiƒá. This wasn't much of a surprise, as Vuƒçetiƒá was sort of the royal painter, who already made two portraits of King Peter I, which was considered a great privilege. From this moment on, one of the \\"most bitter artistic polemics in our society\\" ensued. \\"Veƒçernje Novosti\\" wrote that Vuƒçetiƒá's model is actually a \\"chunk of detached bolder\\". Art historian Vladimir Petkoviƒá was one of the major opponents of the project. Poet and diplomat Jovan Duƒçiƒá praised the design, saying it \\"radiates with thoughtfulness\\". However, after the monument was unveiled, he amended his stand a bit. The pedestal was sculptured in Belgrade, while the bronze parts of the composition were cast in Rome. The monument was dedicated on , commemorating the return of the Serbian army from the Balkan Wars. Members of the royal household were present at the dedication, including King Peter I, Karaƒëorƒëe's grandson. One of the newspapers gave a detailed overview of the monument: \\"Several soldiers from the First Serbian Uprising are climbing up. One of them is taking in his arms a baby given to him by the peasant women, maybe his wife. To kiss the baby for the last time in his life. Old guslar slowly walks after the rebels, with gusle in his bag, who will boost the spirit of the Serbian avengers in the leafy woodlands. On top is Karaƒëorƒëe. On his one side are the sabre and the rifle, while on the other is Vila with the flag and the wreath\\". According to the newspaper reports from the event, after the king removed the white sheet unveiling the monument, the crowd was silent, with occasional whisper, which was reported as the major dislike of the design. Polemics about the monument only intensified after the dedication, this time being predominantly negative. Mo≈°a Pijade, a student of Vuƒçetiƒá, was one of the main objectors (\\"bronze abomination, disgrace for Serbia which should be demolished with the pickaxe\\"). Public considered that Karaƒëorƒëe's appearance is not heroic enough, that it doesn't resemble the fierce rebellion leader and having unnatural facial expression, while some openly called for the \\"patched\\" monument to be demolished. Author Branislav Nu≈°iƒá was member of the Board for the Building of the Monument. When on the unveiling ceremony he was asked by the Prince George, king's oldest son, what he thinks of the monument now, Nu≈°iƒá replied he now prays to be a member of the Demolition Board. As prince and his entourage laughed out loud, the reporters concluded that the royal family is not happy with the monument either. Writer and journalist Dragutin Iliƒá liked the monument, calling the composition poetic. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Belgrade in World War I, the Austrians planned to erect the bronze monument to their emperor, Franz Joseph I on the very spot of the Karaƒëorƒëe's monument. In 1916 they dismantled the monument, claiming it was damaged in fighting. Then they melted it to reuse the bronze. When the massive Franz Joseph monument was being shipped to Belgrade in 1918, Serbian forces captured the ship and confiscated the statue. It was later melted into three church bells, largest of which tolls from the belltower of the Ru≈æica Church, within the fortress. The monument was so generally disliked, that it was never reconstructed. Instead, a Monument of Gratitude to France was dedicated on its location, on 11 November 1930. The only remaining part of the monument complex is the figure of old guslar. It is exceptionally preserved so city authorities decided to return it to Kalamegdan and to place it close to the Monument of Gratitude to France and its previous location, by the end of 2019.  1979 monument  Karaƒëorƒëe Monument in the cloudy sunset Socialist Union of Serbia concluded that the monument to Karaƒëorƒëe should be erected somewhere in the town. The Union didn't discus any details, but they conveyed the decision to the City Assembly of Belgrade. Neither the state granted funds, nor the city had money as the monument wasn't planned. City's Institute for the Protection of the Cultural Monuments selected the location, a small mound on top of the Vraƒçar plateau. They decided to use already existing sculpture by Sreten Stojanoviƒá, who died in 1960. The sculpture was kept chained in the coal cellar of the foundry \\"Plastika\\" for decades and Stojanoviƒá's family decided to donate the sculpture to the city. The statue was cast in the lost-wax casting process (cire perdue). City then organized the browning of the statue, founding of the mound and installation of the piles, finding sponsors for the works. The granite pedestal turned out to be a problem. A slab of the size and quality stipulated by the design, couldn't be found in Yugoslavia, nor couldn't be produced in such a short period of time. In the end, the smaller pedestal from the Aranƒëelovac stone was reluctantly chosen. Architect Zoran Jakovljeviƒá projected the pedestal design. The monument was dedicated in 1979. The bronze monument is tall. It is situated on top of the mound. In time, it became one of the most recognizable monuments in Belgrade, especially as the works on the church progressed and the plateau was architecturally arranged, but also due to its monumental appearance being elevated from the surrounding terrain. The monument is located at the crossroads of the Boulevard of Liberation, Neboj≈°ina and Kru≈°edolska streets. Behind (that is, east) of the monument is the Church of Saint Sava, which is connected to the monument via the park-style plateau and fountains. To the south is the National Library of Serbia. Across the Neboj≈°ina Street is the northernmost tip of the Karaƒëorƒëev Park, while further across the boulevard is the Park Milutin Milankoviƒá.

It stipulates that GRETA can have from 10 to 15 members of independent and impartial experts from a variety of backgrounds. They have been chosen from amongst nationals of the States Parties to the Convention and are known for their competence and professional experience in the areas covered by the Convention; the term of office is four years, renewable once. The current composition of GRETA reflects a gender and geographical balance. The Group is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Convention by the Parties, following a procedure divided in rounds. At the beginning of each round, GRETA defines autonomously the provisions to be monitored and determines the most appropriate means to carry out the evaluation, being guided by the Rules of Procedure for Evaluating Implementation of the Convention. In addition, GRETA regularly publishes general reports on its activities.  History  The Convention was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 3 May 2005 and entered into force on 1 February 2008. GRETA held its first meeting at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg from 24 to 27 February 2009.https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805aa822 The meeting elected, for a first term of office of two years, a president and two vice-presidents. The 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings was celebrated with the conference: ‚ÄúTen years of implementation of the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings: impact and challenges ahead‚Äù. It was held on 22 May 2018 at the Palais de l‚ÄôEurope in Strasbourg, France. The conference brought together some 180 participants, including national anti-trafficking co-ordinators and rapporteurs, civil society representatives, survivors of human trafficking, representatives of international organizations, academia and business. = Legislation on Human Trafficking = There are three main legal instruments on Human Trafficking, one of which lead to the creation of GRETA: 1\\\\. The United Nations General Assembly on 15 November 2000 adopted a resolution that established the Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The Convention had three supplementary protocols: * Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. * Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. * Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms. 2\\\\. The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings that established GRETA as the monitoring mechanism on Human Trafficking; 3\\\\. The Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims.  Structure  GRETA is composed of 15 independent members and impartial experts, who are selected by the Committee of the Parties for four years. The composition of GRETA consists of one president, two vice presidents, and thirteen experts. The GRETA members are elected according to the Rules on the election procedurehttps://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805c7260, which stipulates that the members \\"must have recognised competence in the fields of human rights, of assistance and protection of victims or of action against trafficking in human beings, or professional experience in the areas covered by the Convention. They must serve in their individual capacity, be independent and impartial, and be available to serve GRETA effectively\\". The candidates are nominated by the States party to the Convention.  Objective  GRETA's main objective is to evaluate the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings by the parties, following a procedure divided in five parts as established by the Rules of Procedure for Evaluating Implementation of the Convention.https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805a983c&format;=native  Rules of Procedure for Evaluating Implementation of the Convention  The Rules of procedure for evaluating implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings by the partieshttps://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805a983c were adopted on 17 June 2009 and amended on 21 November 2014; they finally entered into force on 1 January 2015. They provided a specific structure to the evaluation mechanism, dividing it into five parts: PART I: Evaluation Procedure; it's divided in rounds and the duration of each evaluation round shall be four years, unless otherwise decided by GRETA. The Group selects the specific provisions of the Convention on which each evaluation round shall be based. PART II: Means of evaluation; for each evaluation round GRETA shall prepare a questionnaire on the implementation by the parties and it shall be public. The parties then respond to the questionnaire within the time-limit set by GRETA. The Group may decide to address the questionnaire or any other request for information to specific non-governmental organizations, other relevant organizations and members of civil society of the parties, which shell be active in the field of action against trafficking in human beings. Subsidiarily to the information submitted in writing, GRETA may decide to carry out a country visit to the party concerned if it considers it necessary to complement this information or to evaluate the practical implementation of the measures taken. PART III: Reports and conclusions; GRETA appoints Rapporteurs for each evaluating report. It consists of a descriptive part, an analytical part and conclusions. The draft report shall be examined, discussed and approved by GRETA in plenary, then transmitted to the party concerned for comments, to be provided within the time-limit set by GRETA. The Group shall adopt its report and conclusions by 2/3 majority of the votes cast and then transmit them to the party, which shall be invited to submit any final comments within a month of adoption. GRETA's report and conclusions, together with eventual comments by the party concerned, shall be made public, at the expiry of the time-limit of one month to make comments, and sent to the Committee of the Parties. PART IV: Information Technology _;_ to contribute to the efficient functioning of the monitoring mechanism and to facilitate the work of stakeholders involved, information technology shall be used at every step of the procedure for evaluating the implementation of the Convention by the parties. PART V: Amendments _;_ it's specified that these rules may be amended by decision taken by a majority of the members of GRETA.  Monitoring activities  According to the Internal rules of procedure,https://rm.coe.int/CoERMPublicCommonSearchServices/DisplayDCTMContent?documentId=09000016805a983d the monitoring is conducted in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 38 of the Convention and the Rules on the evaluation procedure and by GRETA's members. Annual reports are submitted to the Committee of the Parties and the Committee of Ministers. As of the 14 January 2020, GRETA produced 8 general reports on its activities, which cover different spaces of time. Apart from obtaining information from civil society, GRETA also conducts country monitoring activities; in this framework GRETA evaluates the measures taken by the parties (according to Article 36, paragraph 1 of the Convention). Therefore, GRETA designs and develops questionnaires, assesses and evaluates works of countries. The answers are submitted by the countries when requested by GRETA; the Group can also request additional information after receiving the questionnaire.https://rm.coe.int/greta-2018-26-en/16808f0990 = Other activities = GRETA helds activities in order to promote a better understanding and implementation of its reports and conclusions. Round-tables proposed to all of the countries evaluated by GRETA are a means to discuss the implementation of GRETA's recommendations since 2012. Other activities are conferences, capacity building, and meetings of National Co-ordinators.  Criticism  According to the study conducted by Conny Rijken (INTERVICT, Tilburg University),https://www.osce.org/cthb/116662?download=true GRETA does not comprehensively and consistently address child specific needs in accordance with the Convention, for example, as regards to children who are mentally less gifted but are able to function in society to a certain extent, especially young girls with limited capacities seem to be at heightened risk; GRETA, however, does not sufficiently focus on the needs of this group in the first evaluation round. It is also stated that GRETA should reinforce addressing attention to male victims in terms of assistance and protection measures and of awareness raising. In a broader perspective, according to Rijken, GRETA could/should: * ask questions regarding how labour exploitation has been defined in national laws as the definition of labour exploitation needs to be further studied; * be more consistent in how it evaluates reflection and recovery period for illegally residing migrants; * use experience of other international monitoring bodies in order to ensure transparency in its evaluation criteria regarding recent developments in the States' obligations; * follow the structure of the Convention on the Action against Trafficking in Human Beings; * explain what GRETA expects from States regarding human rights based approach, with an explanation that only if States have implemented the Convention in line with all Convention obligations, it can claim it has implemented a human rights-based approach. According to the research conducted by La Strada International regarding the first round of evaluations by GRETA, (i) when NGOs received questionnaires they wanted to be instructed what was expected from them in order to provide input; (ii) during country visits, there were not enough time reserved to discuss all the issues NGOs wanted to talk about.http://lastradainternational.org/lsidocs/3058-NGO%20survey%20on%20GRETA%20monitoring.pdf  References  Category:Council of Europe treaties ","title":"GRETA"},{"id":"62278448","title":"Miss USA World 1966"},{"id":"62278461","text":"Liu Guangbin (born 3 November 1979) is a Chinese speed skater.

Background The term ‚Äòinstant‚Äô refers to the fact that this type of business aims to provide a faster cash offer on a property than traditional real estate brokers. Valuation of the property takes place online and is an instantaneous or near-instantaneous process which makes use of machine learning and AI technologies. Examples of companies using the iBuyer model include Opendoor, Offerpad, Casavo, Nested, Zillow Offers, and RedfinNow. The iBuyer process iBuyer companies use computer-generated analysis of market data, information supplied by sellers, and in some cases input from local real estate agents, to make instant cash offers on residential properties. Individuals wishing to sell their house are asked to enter basic information about the property on a company‚Äôs website. In a process largely driven by machine learning and automated data analysis, the property‚Äôs approximate value is determined and an initial offer is made. If the offer is accepted by the seller, the company arranges an inspection of the property to ensure that the data supplied is concomitant with the actual condition of the building. From a seller‚Äôs perspective, the process of selling his or her property can take under two weeks. Once an iBuyer company has purchased a property, it arranges for any necessary repairs or modifications to be carried out in the building. The property is then re-sold. Businesses operating under the iBuyer transaction model make their profit on the fees incurred on the seller, which are typically marginally higher (1-4%) than those charged by traditional real estate companies. From an Instant buyer company‚Äôs perspective, the higher fees cover the investment risk involved in holding the property for a potentially long period of time. For a seller, the fees are paid in exchange for a much faster property-selling process than with a traditional real estate model and for avoiding the need to make repairs and improvements to the property prior to selling.

At least 37 people were killed, and dozens more are missing or injured.  Background  Burkina Faso faced an uprising in 2014 leading to the downfall of President Blaise Compaor√© later that year. Burkina Faso is a member of the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership and its commitment of peacekeeping troops in Mali and Sudan has made it a target for extremists in the region. Until 2015, Burkina Faso had remained violence free despite violent events occurring in the northern neighbouring countries of Mali and Niger. Since then, jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State began their infiltration into the country from the northern borders followed by its eastern borders. The infiltration have also brought danger to the southern and western borders. Since 2015, Burkina Faso has faced cross- border attacks and sporadic raids in its territory, the result of instability and unrest in neighboring countries. In the year 2019, ethnic and religious tensions increased as a result of the Islamist insurgency in Burkina Faso. The effect is more prominent in the northern areas of Burkina Faso bordering Mali, with attackers often crossing the border between the countries. According to the UN Refugee agency, in the last three months preceding October, more than a quarter of a million people have been forced to flee their homes in Burkina Faso. The gold mine in Boungou has come under attack before. Eleven people were killed in two separate ambushes in 2018. The first ambush, in August 2018, killed six people, including five gendarmes. After the attack, Semafo increased security at the Boungou mine. In December 2018, five people including four gendarmes were killed when the lead vehicle of a convoy returning from an escort mission hit a landmine.  Attack  The attack happened in the morning. The target of the attack was a convoy of five buses carrying gold mine workers heading to the Semafo gold mine in Boungou. The convoy was being escorted by military vehicles. The attack started when a military vehicle escorting the convoy hit a landmine. Shortly afterwards, gunmen approached the convoy and opened fire, targeting two buses carrying workers as well as the military escort vehicles. At least 37 people were killed in the attack, not including any security forces who may have been killed while battling the attackers. A large number of people remained unaccounted for after the attack, with some survivors suggesting a death toll of over 100. One survivor said that he was one of only 3 survivors from a bus that initially carried over 80 people. Of the dead, 19 were workers for the Australian mining company Perenti Global, with of its workers hospitalized.  Aftermath  Semafo initially stated that the Boungou mine remained secured, and operations continued as usual. The company also confirmed that it was working with authorities to ensure the security of its employees and contractors. After the attack, the company's stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell 11 percent, to $3.49. Shortly afterwards, Semafo suspended its operations in the Boungou mine.

He was the son of the famous privateer Jean Bart. Family Fran√ßois Cornil Bart was the oldest of four children of Jean Bart and his first wife, Nicole Gontier of Dunkirk. His father was an illiterate fisherman from Dunkirk who had risen through the ranks of the navy to become chef d'escadre. Fran√ßois Cornil was born in Dunkirk on 16 June 1677. He married Marie Vignereux, by whom he had several children, including Philippe-Fran√ßois Bart, who became a chef d'escadre in the navy, and Gaspard- Fran√ßois Bart, who became a colonel chef de brigade in the army. Early years Fran√ßois Cornil Bart went to sea in 1688 at the age of 11 on his father's ship. In April 1689 he sailed under his father on La Railleuse, escorting a munitions convoy to Brest, accompanied by Claude de Forbin. They encountered a Dutch privateer on 1 May 1689, which they chased down and boarded. Forbin relates that when the engagement began, Jean Bart thought his son showed a sign of fear, and tied him to the main mast for the duration of the fight to accustom him to defying danger. During his career, he would take part in nineteen boardings, eleven with his father, and eight after his father died. Fran√ßois Cornil Bart became a garde-marine on 1 January 1692. Jean Bart was ennobled in August 1694 by letters signed by King Louis XIV and countersigned by Louis Ph√©lypeaux. This gave Francois-Cornil the right to call himself the Chevalier Bart. Fran√ßois Cornil dissociated himself from a cousin named Jean Bart, a simple sailor, before his father died on 27 April 1702 . As he rose in the navy he cut his ties with his cousins, who were tailors, coopers, carpenters, sailors and fishmongers, and tried to behave as a true gentleman. Naval officer Battle at The Lizard 21 October 1707 Fran√ßois Cornil Bart was in turn ship-of-the-line lieutenant (lieutenant de vaisseau) and frigate captain (capitaine de fr√©gate). He was second in command to Forbin on 2 October 1706 in a fierce battle near Hamburg when the French took many merchantmen escorted by six Dutch vessels. On 23 November 1712 he was promoted to ship-of-the-line captain (capitaine de vaisseau). When Peter the Great visited Paris in May 1717 the court of Versaille ordered Cornil Bart to accompany the Tsar from Calais to Paris, where he stayed as long as the Russian emperor remained. On 20 June 1718 King Louis XV made him a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. On 1 May 1741 Fr.-Corn. Bart, then one of the oldest captains, was raised to the rank of chef d'escadre on the recommendation of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, Duke of Penthi√®vre, Admiral of France. On 7 February 1750 he was made lieutenant-general of the naval armies under the minister Antoine Louis Rouill√©. He was promoted to vice admiral of Ponant on 1 September 1752. At that time there were two vice admirals, Levant in charge of the ports and ships in the Mediterranean, and Ponant in charge of the French ports and fleets of the ocean. On 23 August 1753 he received the grand cross of the Order of Saint Louis. Bart died on 22 April 1755 at the age of 78. He is buried with his father in the √âglise Saint-Eloi in Dunkirk. When his widow applied for a pension it was granted immediately, which was unusual at that time.

The Master of the von Groote worship was the name given to the C group to which were assigned 19 works, of which 11 paintings 8 painted copies that fall stylistically outside the group.Suzanne Laemers, Max J.

Kunst en kennerschap, een leven gewijd aan de vroege Nederlandse schilderkunst, doctoral dissertation defended at the Universiteit Utrecht 17 November 2017 The main work was a depiction of the Adoration of the Magi, then in the collection of Freiherr von Groote and now in the St√§del Museum.Max J.

In: Jahrbuch der k√∂niglich preu√üischen Kunstsammlungen 36 (1915), pp. 65‚Äì91 The style differences within the original group are significant, but the number of repetitions of the same theme, in particular that of the Adoration of the Magi was important when putting the group together. Style characteristics The crucifixion The Master of the Von Groote Adoration is considered a representative of Antwerp Mannerism. The term Antwerp Mannerism was coined by Friedl√§nder in the early 20th century to refer to a transitory phase in Netherlandish art from the late Gothic to works inspired by the Italian Renaissance. The terms \\"Manier\\" and \\"Manierist\\" were used by Friedl√§nder to refer to the original even unusual motifs in the body of work categorized under this style. The terms carried a pejorative connotation as these works were regarded as inferior to work produced by Pieter Coecke van Aelst, Quentin Matsys and other contemporaries.Dorothy Limouze, Rezension Kristin Lohse Belkin / Nico van Hout: (ed.) ExtravagAnt! A forgotten chapter of Antwerp painting, 1500-1530, Antwerpen: Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten 2005, 239 p. at arthistoricum.net The style of these works was often extravagant. This was reflected in how the folds of the flamboyant and exotic clothes worn by the figures defied gravity.ExtravagAnt! Antwerp pictures for the European market 1500-1525 at Codart These figures were usually depicted in agitated poses amidst architectural ruins.J. Koldeweij, A. Hermesdorf and P. Huvenne, 'De schilderkunst der Lage Landen: De Middeleeuwen en de zestiende eeuw', Amsterdam University Press, 2006, p. 172-175 The earlier works included Gothic architecture but in later works Renaissance structures became prevalent. The paintings appear to combine Early Netherlandish and Northern Renaissance styles, and incorporate both Flemish and Italian traditions into the same compositions. Most of the artists of Antwerp Mannerism have remained anonymous and only some of the artists have been identified. They include Jan de Beer, Adriaen van Overbeke and the Master of 1518 (possibly Jan Mertens or Jan van Dornicke). Friedl√§nder stated that the list of 19 works that he included in the body of work attributed to the Master of the Von Groote Adoration was not complete but showed sufficiently the characteristics of the master to which further attributions would not add anything. Friedl√§nder did not detect an artist's personality in the group of works. He rather viewed the works as the product of a workshop relying on the same compositions and types. Friedl√§nder had a negative view of the artistic value of the output of the master as he found his work tedious and unimaginative. In contrast to the first two groups of Antwerp Mannerists Friedl√§nder identified, i.e. the Pseudo-Bles and the presumed Jan de Beer group, on which he heaped praise because of their originality, the Master of the Von Groote Adoration could not count on his appreciation. He regarded the Master as an uninspired follower of Pseudo-Bles and his work lacking liveliness and expression. The works of the Master of the Von Groote Adoration and Friedl√§nder's D-group referred to as the Master of the Antwerp Adoration are so close that he assumed that there had been a shared workshop. However, the first master is regarded as less imaginative and his figures seem more frozen.D. De Vos, Meester van de von Groote Aanbidding, in: Anonieme Vlaamse Primitieven red.

Personal life Stivaletta was born on June 9, 1934 to Joseph J. and Antoinette (n√©e Paldero) Stivaletta. He had brothers Albert, Joseph, Paul, Michael, Edward, and Robert. He had four children, Deborah, Cheryl, Arthur, and Jay. He was friends with Massachusetts Auditor Joseph DeNucci. Stivaletta died April 18, 2002 at the Glover Hospital in Needham, Massachusetts and was buried at Brookdale Cemetery. Political activism Stivaletta considered himself to be an \\"average American,\\" but others called him a \\"superpatriot\\" and a \\"modern Paul Revere. His rallies frequently featured conservative figures such as Bob Hope and Al Capp. He received national attention for his efforts. =Vietnam War= Several days before Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, Stivaletta had a dream in which he saw Pope John XXIII, President John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln, and Bob Hope. The dream ended with a white dove being chased by a raven carrying an olive branch in its beak. He interpreted the dream as a call to wake America up and to warn them of false peacemakers. During an October 1969 rally attended by 100,000 protesters on Boston Common to end the war, he dropped thousands of leaflets on the crowd in support of the troops from an airplane overhead. In the spring of 1970, he sponsored a \\"Wake Up America\\" rally on the Common to support \\"the Constitution, God and Country.\\" The rally, which was hosted by Hope, attracted a crowd of 65,000 people. In the 1970s, Stivaletta campaigned for more pride in the United States and condemned acts he saw as unpatriotic, such as \\"burning the American flag, waving the Vietcong Flag, and what the SDS and the Weathermen do.\\" Bumper stickers and billboard messages he produced were commonly seen during that decade. He also sponsored a bracelet campaign to show support for prisoners of war. =Plaque= In 1976 Stivaletta persuaded the Massachusetts House of Representatives to erect a plaque in the Massachusetts State House honoring him. It read in part, \\"Presented in grateful recognition to Arthur Stivaletta ... His dream of sharing his love of country with his fellow Americans will live forever[.]\\" =Terrorism= Following the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 ad the 40 American hostages in Beirut, Stivaletta hired a plane to tow a banner along the Massachusetts coast from Scituate to Salisbury that read: \\"Mr. Wake Up America says, 'Let's kick ass with terrorists.'\\" =Flag burnings= During the Vietnam War, he burned the flag of the Viet Cong on the Boston Common. In 1981, he burned a Soviet flag to protest the suppression of human rights in Poland. After the Iran hostage crisis, he burned Iranian flags. Philanthropy He was chairman of the Friends of the Christopher Columbus Committee that erected a statue of Columbus at the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park in the North End of Boston. =Baby Cemetery= In the late 1940s, Joseph Stivaletta purchased land that once housed Hannah B. Chickering's Temporary Asylum for Discharged Female Prisoners. He discovered Baby Cemetery on the property and, rather than disturb the graves, set the land aside and did not build a home on it. When Massachusetts Route 128 was being constructed, Joseph convinced then- Transportation Secretary John Volpe to move the road rather than disturb the graves. Volpe's family came from the same small town in Italy as Joseph. In 1998, Stivaletta and the other heirs to his father's estate gifted the land to the Town of Dedham.

She was educated at the Karachi Grammar School which she joined at the age of four and completed in 1968. Her parents were keen for her to acquire a vocation and therefore, she joined the Sind University, Jamshoro and graduated in 1973. After a year at the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Hospital, Karachi as a junior surgeon, she left for London for post graduate qualifications in 1975. In London she met Hasan Askari, and they were married in Karachi in October 1976. = 1977-1997 = As her husband Hasan Askari was an investment banker, Nasreen's career was affected by his travels. The couple left for Hong Kong in late 1980 (where she re-qualified as a dentist) and worked at a prestigious dental practice in Central. In 1985, when her husband was transferred to Tokyo and she was expected to re-qualify again as a dentist, she gave up the profession and enrolled at Sophia University, Tokyo to study Asian Art and Civilisation. During this time, Iman, her son and Sehr, her daughter, were born.  Career  = Colours of the Indus = Nasreen's interest in textiles was first kindled while a student in Jamshoro where she began her collection. By 1997, she had a formidable personal collection of textiles from all over Pakistan with a focus on Sindh. In 1997, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Pakistan, she was asked to co-curate the first exhibition on Pakistani costume and textiles in the United Kingdom. The exhibition opened at the Victoria & Albert Museum to critical acclaim in October 1997. Initially scheduled to run for three months, it was extended by popular demand to seven months and travelled to the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh.

(English: Don't Blame the Kid, Literally: What fault does the kid have) is a 2016 Mexican comedy film directed by Gustavo Loza and distributed by Adicta Films. The film premiered on 13 May 2016, and stars Karla Souza, and Ricardo Abarca. Plot Mar√≠a Eugenia ‚ÄúMaru‚Äù Lamacona de la Barquera (Karla Souza) wakes up alone in a hotel room in Acapulco, Guerrero, Mexico. Through a flashback, it is revealed that she was attending a wedding along with her best friends Daniela (Fabiola Guajardo), and Paulina (Rocio Garcia). There they meet Renato ‚ÄúLa Rana‚Äù Zamarripa (Ricardo Abarca) and his best friend Abel \\"El Cad√°ver\\" Escobar (Biassini Segura). Heavy drinking and general mayhem ensue causing Maru and her friends to get blackout drunk. Later Maru begins to experience morning sickness and takes a home pregnancy test, where she tests positive. Maru and her friends contact Laura (Sofia Sisniega), whose wedding they attended, which leads Maru back to El Cadaver and thus La Rana. Maru arrives at La Rana's apartment and advises him she is pregnant, much to his surprise. She informs him she has decided to terminate the pregnancy, to his chagrin. While at the clinic with Paulina, she has a change of heart, returns to Renato, and demands he help take care of the baby. He is ecstatic and immediately agrees. However, Maru makes it clear that it does not mean they will be a couple, as she has no romantic feelings for him, and they will only be coparenting. Renato wants to be romantically involved with Maru, and despite his feelings, reluctantly agrees. Maru takes Renato to meet her parents and reveals she is pregnant. Her parents disapprove and demand she return to her unfaithful boyfriend Juan Pablo (Erick Elias) while feigning that he is the father in order to maintain their social status and her father's (Jesus Ochoa) political position. Maru rebels and refuses to return with Juan Pablo. In turn, her parents force marriage on her in order to prevent a political scandal that could cost her father the current election. Renato, in complete disagreement of just being married for the sake of appearances, tells Maru that he wishes to document their journey through film and video, Maru agrees. As they document the various stages of their relationship, Maru begins to develop feelings for Renato but is adamant about saving face, holds back, and vehemently and continually reminds Renato it is all for show. Renato and Maru go on honeymoon where he meets two women. Much to Maru's chagrin, she becomes jealous but stubbornly states she isn't. The morning before they leave back home, Maru initiates sex but later insists it was only a slip. Six months later they find out they are having a boy. Maru has opened up to Renato while still keeping emotional space between them deliberately. On the evening of her baby shower, Maru argues with her father because of the way he treats Renato. Unbeknownst to anyone, Renato has refused a job offer from her father in exchange for his silence, as Renato inadvertently found out he is cheating on his wife. Maru and Renato spend the night together at his home. The next morning Renato reveals his video to her, she realizes she's been unnecessarily holding back her feelings for him, apologies for treating him badly, and declares she too is in love with him. While at work, Renato receives a call from Maru informing him she is in labor. They rush to the hospital, where her parents and friends arrive in time to meet the baby. It is revealed that the baby is of oriental descent. Furthermore, Renato's initial surprise reaction to Maru's pregnancy was genuine. It is implied through flashbacks that Renato knew he was not the father but was in love with Maru all along. At her hospital bedside, Renato tells her he loves her and tells the baby he is his father. Her parents, realizing what he's done, embrace him with open arms. The film closes with Renato making a video for his son in anticipation of possible teasing/bullying him over the fact that he looks oriental but his parents do not. In a mid- credits scene, we see Renato, Maru, their family and friends at Renato, Jr.‚Äôs first birthday. El Cadaver and Paulina are now a couple and are expecting their first child. Renato‚Äôs mother Rosie and Plutarco are together, and Daniela is dating Laura‚Äôs, presumed, ex-husband.

He has particularly studied isoprenoids. He is a member of the French Academy of sciences.  Biography  Michel Rohmer is studying at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de chimie in Strasbourg. He defended his thesis at the Louis-Pasteur University in Strasbourg in 1975 in Guy Ourisson's laboratory. He became professor of organic and bio-organic chemistry at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de chimie in Mulhouse from 1979 to 1994, then returned to the Universit√© Louis-Pasteur in Strasbourg. He was Director of the Institut de chimie de Strasbourg (UMR 7177). Since 1 September 2013, he has been Professor Emeritus of the University of Strasbourg.  Research  Michel Rohmer is working on isoprenoids, a class of natural substances familiar to all in the form of cholesterol in our cells. He studied hopanoids in particular, which are found in sedimentary rock materials. He then discovered biohopanoids, a family of pentacyclic triterpenoids. His work on the biosynthesis of these bacterial hopanoids is revolutionizing the understanding of the early stages of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Rohmer proposes a new biosynthetic pathway leading to the universal precursors of isoprenoids, isopentenyl and dimethylallyl diphosphates. This path is different from the mevalonate path that has been accepted for more than fifty years. The metabolic pathway of methylerythritol phosphate is widely distributed in bacteria, which are omnipresent in the chloroplasts of phototrophic organisms.

Archaeological evidence for trade, probably involving barter systems, dates back more than 10,000 years. As civilizations grew, barter was replaced with retail trade involving coinage. Selling and buying are thought to have emerged in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) in around the 7th-millennium BCE.Jones, Brian D.G.; Shaw, Eric H. (2006). \\"A History of Marketing Thought\\", Handbook of Marketing. Weitz, Barton A.; Wensley, Robin (eds), Sage, p. 41, . Gharipour points to evidence of primitive shops and trade centers in Sialk Hills in Kashan (6000 BCE), Catalk Huyuk in modern-day Turkey (7,500‚Äì5,700 BCE), Jericho (2600 BCE) and Susa (4000 BCE).Gharipour, M., \\"The Culture and Politics of Commerce\\", in The Bazaar in the Islamic City: Design, Culture, and History, Mohammad Gharipour (ed.), New York, The American University in Cairo Press, 2012 p. 3 Open air, public markets were known in ancient Babylonia, Assyria, Phoenicia, and Egypt. These markets typically occupied a place in the town's center. Surrounding the market, skilled artisans, such as metal-workers and leather workers, occupied permanent premises in alleys that led to the open market-place. These artisans may have sold wares directly from their premises, but also prepared goods for sale on market days.Bintliff, J., \\"Going to Market in Antiquity\\", In Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums, Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, pp. 209‚Äì50 In ancient Greece markets operated within the agora, an open space where, on market days, goods were displayed on mats or temporary stalls.Thompson, D.B., An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora, ASCSA, 1993 pp. 19‚Äì21 In ancient Rome, trade took place in the forum.McGeough, K.M., The Romans: New Perspectives, ABC-CLIO, 2004, pp. 105‚Äì06 Rome had two forums; the Forum Romanum and Trajan's Forum. The latter was a vast expanse, comprising multiple buildings with shops on four levels.Holleran, C., Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Late Republic and the Principate, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 12 The Roman forum was arguably the earliest example of a permanent retail shop- front.Coleman, P., Shopping Environments, Elsevier, Oxford, 2006, p. 28 In antiquity, exchange involved direct selling via merchants or peddlers and bartering systems were commonplace. The Phoenicians, noted for their seafaring skills, plied their ships across the Mediterranean, becoming a major trading power by the 9th century BCE. The Phoenicians imported and exported wood, textiles, glass and produce such as wine, oil, dried fruit, and nuts. Their trading skills necessitated a network of colonies along the Mediterranean coast, stretching from modern-day Crete through to Tangiers and onto SardiniaCartwright, M., \\"Trade in the Phoenician World\\", Ancient History Encyclopedia, 1 April 2016 The Phoenicians not only traded in tangible goods, but were also instrumental in transporting culture. The Phoenician's extensive trade networks necessitated considerable book-keeping and correspondence. In around 1500 BCE, the Phoenicians developed a consonantal alphabet which was much easier to learn that the complex scripts used in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Phoenician traders and merchants were largely responsible for spreading their alphabet around the region.Daniels (1996) pp. 94‚Äì95. Phoenician inscriptions have been found in archaeological sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and colonies around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos (in present-day Lebanon) and Carthage in North Africa. Grand Bazaar, Istanbul (interior). Established in 1455, it is thought to be the oldest continuously operating covered market In the Graeco-Roman world, the market primarily served the local peasantry. Local producers, who were generally poor, would sell small surpluses from their individual farming activities, purchase minor farm equipment and also buy a few luxuries for their homes. Major producers such as the great estates were sufficiently attractive for merchants to call directly at their farm-gates, obviating the producers' need to attend local markets. The very wealthy landowners managed their own distribution, which may have involved exporting and importing. The nature of export markets in antiquity is well documented in ancient sources and archaeological case studies.Bintliff, J., \\"Going to Market in Antiquity\\", In Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums, Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 229 The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places: oysters from Londinium, cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the Middle East.Paquet-Byrne, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, 2003, pp. 23‚Äì25 Markets were also important centers of social life.ar, F., \\"The World of the Golden Ass\\", Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 71, 1981, pp. 63‚Äì67 The rise of retailing and marketing in England and Europe has been extensively studied, but less is known about developments elsewhere.Southerton, D. (ed.), Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011 p. 888 Nevertheless, recent research suggests that China exhibited a rich history of early retail systems.Moore, K., and Reid., S., \\"The Birth of the Brand: 4000 years of Branding\\", Business History, Vol. 50, 2008. pp. 419‚Äì32. From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding were used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 CE.Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson. A. \\"A Brief History of Branding in China\\", Journal of Macromarketing, Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, pp. 210‚Äì21 Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite.Eckhardt, G.M. and Bengtsson.

A. \\"A Brief History of Branding in China\\", Journal of Macromarketing, Vol, 30, no. 3, 2010, p. 219  Medieval Europe  The Row, Chester, Cheshire, England, c. 1895; a unique medieval shopping arcade In Medieval England and Europe, relatively few permanent shops were to be found; instead, customers walked into the tradesman's workshops where they discussed purchasing options directly with tradesmen. In 13th- century London, mercers, and haberdashers were known to exist and grocers sold \\"miscellaneous small wares as well as spices and medicines\\" but fish and other perishables were sold through markets, costermongers, hucksters, peddlers or other types of itinerant vendor.Thrupp, S.L., The Merchant Class of Medieval London, 1300‚Äì1500, pp. 7‚Äì8 In the more populous cities, a small number of shops were beginning to emerge by the 13th century. In Chester, a medieval covered shopping arcade represented a major innovation that attracted shoppers from many miles around. Known as \\"The Rows\\" this medieval shopping arcade is believed to be the first of its kind in Europe.Pevsner, N. and Hubbard, E., The Buildings of England: Cheshire Penguin, 1978, p. 170 Fragments of Chester's Medieval Row, which is believed to date to the mid-13th century, can still be found in Cheshire.Jones, P., Building Chester, Chapter 5 In the 13th or 14th century, another arcade with several shops was recorded at Drapery Row in Winchester.Keene, D. and Rumble, A.R., Survey of Medieval Winchester, (Part 1), Oxford University Press, 1985, p. 578 The emergence of street names such as Drapery Row, Mercer's Lane and Ironmonger Lane in the medieval period suggests that permanent shops were becoming more commonplace. A typical 17th- century shop, with customers being served through an opening onto the street Medieval shops had little in common with their modern equivalent. As late as the 16th century, London's shops were described as little more than \\"rude booths\\" and their owners \\"bawled as loudly as the itinerants.\\"Knight, C., London, Vol. 5, 1841, Knight & Co, London, p. 132 Shopfronts typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard.Conlin, J., Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City, Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2 Cox and Dannehl suggest that the Medieval shopper's experience was very different. The lack of glazed windows, which were rare during the medieval period, and did not become commonplace until the eighteenth century, meant that shop interiors were dark places. Outside the markets, goods were rarely out on display and the service counter was unknown. Shoppers had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers.Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 155 Outside the major cities, most consumable purchases were made through markets or fairs. Markets were held daily in the more populous towns and cities or weekly in the more sparsely populated rural districts. Markets sold fresh produce; fruit, vegetables, baked goods, meat, poultry, fish and some ready to eat foodstuffs; while fairs operated on a periodic cycle and were almost always associated with a religious festival.Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516, The List and Index Society, no. 32, 2003 Fairs sold non-perishables such as farm tools, homewares, furniture, rugs and ceramics. Market towns dotted the medieval European landscape while itinerant vendors supplied less populated areas or hard-to-reach districts. Peddlers and other itinerant vendors operated alongside other types of retail for centuries. The political philosopher, John Stuart Mill compared the convenience of markets/fairs to that of the itinerant peddlers: : \\"The contrivance of fairs and markets was early had recourse to, where consumers and producers might periodically meet, without any intermediate agency; and this plan answers tolerably well for many articles, especially agricultural produce ‚Ä¶ but were inconvenient to buyers who have other occupations, and do not live in the immediate vicinity ‚Ä¶ and the wants of the consumers must either be provided for so long beforehand, or must remain so long unsupplied, that even before the resources of society admitted of the establishment of shops, the supply of these wants fell universally into the hands of itinerant dealers: the pedlar, who might appear once a month, being preferred to the fair, which only returned once or twice a year.\\"Mill, J.S., Principles of a Political Economy, London, Longman, 1909, Bk. I, Ch. II Fruit and Vegetable Market, Painting by Arnout de Muyser. c. 1590 Blintiff has investigated the early Medieval networks of market towns across Europe and suggests that by the 12th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional, different day markets and resold them at the larger centralized market towns.Bintliff, J., \\"Going to Market in Antiquity\\", In Stuttgarter Kolloquium zur Historischen Geographie des Altertums, Eckart Olshausen and Holger Sonnabend (eds), Stuttgart, Franz Steiner, 2002, p. 224 Market-places appear to have emerged independently outside Europe. The Grand Bazaar in Istanbul is often cited as the world's oldest continuously-operating market; its construction began in 1455. The Spanish conquistadors wrote glowingly of markets in the Americas. In the 15th century, the Mexica (Aztec) market of Tlatelolco was the largest in all the Americas. English market towns were regulated from a relatively early period. The English monarchs awarded a charter to local Lords to create markets and fairs for a town or village. This charter would grant the lords the right to take tolls and also afford some protection from rival markets. For example, once a chartered market was granted for specific market days, a nearby rival market could not open on the same days.Dyer, C., Everyday Life in Medieval England, London, Hambledon and London, 1994, pp. 283‚Äì303 Across the boroughs of England, a network of chartered markets sprang up between the 12th and 16th centuries, giving consumers reasonable choice in the markets they preferred to patronize.Borsay, P. and Proudfoot, L., Provincial Towns in Early Modern England and Ireland: Change, Convergence and Divergence, [The British Academy], Oxford University Press, 2002, pp. 65‚Äì66 A study on the purchasing habits of the monks and other individuals in medieval England, suggests that consumers of the period were relatively discerning. Purchase decisions were based on purchase criteria such as consumers' perceptions of the range, quality, and price of goods. This informed decisions about where to make their purchases and which markets were superior.Casson, M. and Lee, J., \\"The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective\\", Business History Review, Vol, 85, Spring 2011, , p. 27 Braudel and Reynold have made a systematic study of these European market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. Their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were common in larger cities. Gradually over time, permanent shops with regular trading days began to supplant the periodic markets, while peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution. The physical market was characterized by transactional exchange and the economy was characterized by local trading. Braudel reports that, in 1600, goods traveled relatively short distances ‚Äì grain 5‚Äì10 miles; cattle 40‚Äì70 miles; wool and woollen cloth 20‚Äì40 miles. Following the European age of discovery, goods were imported from afar ‚Äì calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum and coffee from the New World.Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century, Berkeley, CA, University of California Press, 1992 English essayist, Joseph Addison, writing in 1711, described the exotic origin of produce available to English society in the following terms: : \\"Our Ships are laden with the Harvest of every Climate: Our Tables are stored with Spices, and Oils, and Wines: Our Rooms are filled with Pyramids of China, and adorned with the Workmanship of Japan: Our Morning's Draught comes to us from the remotest Corners of the Earth: We repair our Bodies by the Drugs of America and repose ourselves under Indian Canopies. My Friend Sir ANDREW calls the Vineyards of France our Gardens; the Spice-Islands our Hot-beds; the Persians our Silk-Weavers, and the Chinese our Potters. Nature indeed furnishes us with the bare Necessaries of Life, but Traffick gives us greater Variety of what is Useful, and at the same time supplies us with every thing that is Convenient and Ornamental.\\"The Spectator, 19 May 1711, The Spectator Project, Luca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza‚Äôs food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter were sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called ‚Äòresellers‚Äô (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild. Cheesemongers‚Äô shops were situated in the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and direct sellers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.Clerici, L., \\"Le prix du bien commun. Taxation des prix et approvisionnement urbain (Vicence, XVIe-XVIIe si√®cle)\\" [The price of the common good. Official prices and urban provisioning in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Vicenza] in I prezzi delle cose nell‚Äôet√† preindustriale /The Prices of Things in Pre-Industrial Times, [forthcoming], Firenze University Press, 2017.  The 17th, 18th and 19th centuries  The retail service counter was an innovation of the eighteenth century By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. These shopkeepers sold general merchandise, much like a contemporary convenience store or a general store. For example, William Allen, a mercer in Tamworth who died in 1604, sold spices alongside furs and fabrics.Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p,. 129 William Stout of Lancaster retailed sugar, tobacco, nails and prunes at both his shop and at the central markets. His autobiography reveals that he spent most of his time preparing products for sale at the central market, which brought an influx of customers into town.Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, p. 154 As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers. Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 153‚Äì54 Glazing was widely used from the early 18th century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed, Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted that \\"Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now.\\"Cited in Conlin, J., Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City, Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2 Josiah Wedgewood was one of the English entrepreneurs who held expansive displays in his private home or in rented premises Outside the major metropolitan cities, few stores could afford to serve one type of clientele exclusively. However, gradually retail shops introduced innovations that would allow them to separate wealthier customers from the \\"riff raff.\\" One technique was to have a window opening out onto the street from which customers could be served. This allowed the sale of goods to the common people, without encouraging them to come inside. Another solution, that came into vogue from the late sixteenth century was to invite favored customers into a back-room of the store, where goods were permanently on display. Yet another technique that emerged around the same time was to hold a showcase of goods in the shopkeeper's private home for the benefit of wealthier clients. Samuel Pepys, for example, writing in 1660, describes being invited to the home of a retailer to view a wooden jack.Cox, N.C. and Dannehl, K., Perceptions of Retailing in Early Modern England, Aldershot, Hampshire, Ashgate, 2007, pp. 155‚Äì59 The eighteenth-century English entrepreneurs, Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton, both staged expansive showcases of their wares in their private residences or in rented halls.McKendrick, N., Brewer, J. and Plumb. J.H., The Birth of a Consumer Society: The Commercialization of Eighteenth-Century England, London, 1982. Savitt has argued that by the eighteenth century, American merchants, who had been operating as importers and exporters, began to specialize in either wholesale or retail roles. They tended not to specialize in particular types of merchandise, often trading as general merchants, selling a diverse range of product types. These merchants were concentrated in the larger cities. They often provided high levels of credit financing for retail transactions.Savitt, R., \\"Looking Back to See Ahead: Writing the History of American Retailing\\", in Retailing: The Evolution and Development of Retailing, A.M. Findlay, Leigh Sparks (eds), pp. 138‚Äì39 Galeries de bois at au Palais-Royal, one of the earliest shopping arcades in Europe By the late eighteenth century, grand shopping arcades began to emerge across Europe and in the Antipodes. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple- vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcade appeared in Paris, due to its lack of pavement for pedestrians. Retailers, eager to attract window shoppers by providing a shopping environment away from the filthy streets, began to construct rudimentary arcades. Opening in 1771, the Colise√©, situated on the Champs Elysee, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. For Parisians, the location was seen as too remote and the arcade closed within two years of opening. Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked the ends of the Palais Royal, opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life.Conlin, J., Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City, Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2; Willsher, K., \\"Paris's Galeries de Bois, Prototype of the Modern Shopping Centre\\", [A history of cities in 50 buildings, day 6], 30 March 2015 The architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as l‚Äô√àre des passages couverts (the Arcade Era).Lemoine, B., Les Passages Couverts, Paris: D√©l√©gation √† l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. . In the European capitals, shopping arcades spread across the continent, reaching their heyday in the early 19th century: the Palais Royal in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799. London's Piccadilly Arcade (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (1878).Sassatelli, R., Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics, Sage, 2007, p. 27; Although the author specifically names Piccadilly Arcade, it is possible that she intended Burlington Arcade in Piccadilly. Designed to attract the genteel middle class, arcade retailers sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements, and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid-nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pass-time for the emerging middle classes. The Illustrated Guide to Paris of 1852 summarized the appeal of arcades in the following description: The Piccadilly entrance to the Burlington Arcade in 1827‚Äì28, shortly after its opening : \\"In speaking of the inner boulevards, we have made mention again and again of the arcades which open onto them. These arcades, a recent invention of industrial luxury, are glass-roofed, marble-paneled corridors extending through whole blocks of buildings, whose owners have joined together for such enterprises. Lining both sides of these corridors, which get their light from above, are the most elegant shops so that the arcade is a city, a world in miniature, in which customers will find everything they need.\\"Cited in: Woodward, R.B., \\"Making a Pilgrimage to Cathedrals of Commerce\\" The New York Times, 11 March 2007 The Palais-Royal, which opened to Parisians in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example in the grand shopping arcades.Mitchell, I., Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850, Routledge, Oxon, p. 140 The Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, caf√©s, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, caf√©s, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90‚Äì93 London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue from the outset.Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 92‚Äì95 Other notable nineteenth- century grand arcades include the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's √ái√ßek Pasajƒ± opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II first opened in 1877. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern shopping mall. The original Toad Lane Store, Rochdale, Manchester; one of Britain's earliest co-operative stores While the arcades were the province of the bourgeoisie, a new type of retail venture emerged to serve the needs of the working poor. John Stuart Mill wrote about the rise of the co-operative retail store, which he witnessed first-hand in the mid-nineteenth century. Stuart Mill locates these co-operative stores within a broader co-operative movement which was prominent in the industrial city of Manchester and in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. He documents one of the early co-operative retail stores in Rochdale in Manchester, England, \\"In 1853, the Store purchased for ¬£745, a warehouse (freehold) on the opposite side of the street, where they keep and retail their stores of flour, butcher's meat, potatoes, and kindred articles.\\" Stuart Mill also quoted a contemporary commentator who wrote of the benefits of the co-operative store: > Buyer and seller meet as friends; there is no overreaching on one side, and > no suspicion on the other... These crowds of humble working men, who never > knew before when they put good food in their mouths, whose every dinner was > adulterated, whose shoes let in the water a month too soon, whose waistcoats > shone with devil's dust, and whose wives wore calico that would not wash, > now buy in the markets like millionaires, and as far as pureness of food > goes, live like lords.Mill, J.S., Principles of a Political Economy with > some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, 7th ed., London, Longman, > 1909, Section IV.7.53  Modern era  Department stores, such as Le Bon March√© of France, appeared from the mid nineteenth century The modern era of retailing is defined as the period from the industrial revolution to the 21st century.Reshaping Retail: Why Technology is Transforming the Industry and How to Win in the New Consumer Dr In major cities, the department store emerged in the mid- to late 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and redefined concepts of service and luxury. The term, \\"department store\\" originated in America. In 19th-century England, these stores were known as emporia or warehouse shops. In London, the first department stores appeared in Oxford Street and Regent Street, where they formed part of a distinctly modern shopping precinct.Iarocci, L., Visual Merchandising: The Image of Selling, Ashgate Publishing, 2013, pp. 120‚Äì21 When London draper, William Whiteley attempted to transform his Bayswater drapery store into a department store by adding a meat and vegetable department and an Oriental Department in around 1875, he met with extreme resistance from other shop-keepers, who resented that he was encroaching on their territory and poaching their customers.Rappaport. E.D., \\"The Halls of Temptation: Gender, Politics, and the Construction of the Department Store in Late Victorian London\\", Journal of British Studies, Vol. 35, No. 1, 1996, pp. 58‚Äì83 Online: Before long, however, major department stores began to open across the US, Britain and Europe from the mid-nineteenth century, including Harrod's of London in 1834; Kendall's in Manchester in 1836; Selfridges of London in 1909; Macy's of New York in 1858; Bloomingdale's in 1861; Sak's in 1867; J.C. Penney in 1902; Le Bon March√© of France in 1852 and Galeries Lafayette of France in 1905.Howard, V., From Main Street to Mall: The Rise and Fall of the American Department Store, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015, Chapter 1; Lindgren, Y., Reynolds, S., Paris-Edinburgh: Cultural Connections in the Belle Epoque, Routledge, 2016, p. 41; All Above Board: Creating The Ideal Corporate Board, p. 120 Other twentieth-century innovations in retailing included chain stores, mail-order, multi-level marketing (pyramid selling or network marketing, 1920s), party plans ( 1930s) and B2C e-commerce.Coopey, R., O'Connell, S. and Porter, D., Mail Order Retailing in Britain: A Business and Social History, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 100; Coleman, M.J. and Ganong, L.G. (eds), The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1, Sage, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p. Many of the early department stores were more than just a retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could indulge in a manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.Howard Moss, M., Shopping as an Entertainment Experience, Plymouth, Lexington Books, pp. 35‚Äì39 One such market that used themed events was the Dayton Arcade. Its opening day celebrations in 1904 used themed stalls to introduce shoppers to goods from around the world. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first hypermarket in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris During this period, retailers worked to develop modern retail marketing practices. Pioneering merchants who contributed to modern retail marketing and management methods include: A. T. Stewart, Potter Palmer, John Wanamaker, Montgomery Ward, Marshall Field, Richard Warren Sears, Rowland Macy, J.C. Penney, Fred Lazarus, brothers Edward and William Filene and Sam Walton.Tsang, D., Kazeroony, H.H. and Ellis, G., The Routledge Companion to International Management Education, London, Routledge, p. 120 Retail, using mail order, came of age during the mid-19th century. Although catalogue sales had been used since the 15th century, this method of retailing was confined to a few industries such as the sale of books and seeds. However, improvements in transport and postal services led several entrepreneurs on either side of the Atlantic to experiment with catalogue sales. In 1861, Welsh draper Pryce Pryce-Jones sent catalogues to clients who could place orders for flannel clothing which was then despatched by post. This enabled Pryce-Jones to extend his client base across Europe.Goldstein. J., 101 Amazing Facts about Wales, Andrews, UK, 2013 A decade later, the US retailer, Montgomery Ward also devised a catalogue sales and mail-order system. His first catalogue which was issued in August 1872 consisted of an 8 in √ó 12 in (20 cm √ó 30 cm) single- sheet price list, listing 163 items for sale with ordering instructions for which Ward had written the copy. He also devised the catch-phrase \\"satisfaction guaranteed or your money back\\" which was implemented in 1875. By the 1890s, Sears and Roebuck were also using mail order with great success. Edward Filene, a proponent of the scientific approach to retail management, developed the concept of the automatic bargain Basement. Although Filene's basement was not the first ‚Äòbargain basement‚Äô in the U.S., the principles of ‚Äòautomatic mark-downs‚Äô generated excitement and proved very profitable. Under Filene's plan, merchandise had to be sold within 30 days or it was marked down; after a further 12 days, the merchandise was further reduced by 25% and if still unsold after another 18 days, a further markdown of 25% was applied. If the merchandise remained unsold after two months, it was given to charity.\\"Pioneers in Marketing: Edward A. Filene, Lincoln Filene and Daniel Bloomfield\\", Journal of Marketing, Vol. 23, No. 3, 1959, pp. 296‚Äì300 Filene was a pioneer in employee relations. He instituted a profit sharing program, a minimum wage for women, a 40-hour work week, health clinics and paid vacations. He also played an important role in encouraging the Filene Cooperative Association, \\"perhaps the earliest American company union\\". Through this channel he engaged constructively with his employees in collective bargaining and arbitration processes.Stillman, Y., \\"Edward Filene: Pioneer of Social Responsibility\\", Jewish Currents, September 2004 Shopping mall in Warsaw, Poland In the post-war period, an American architect, Victor Gruen developed a concept for a shopping mall; a planned, self-contained shopping complex complete with an indoor plaza, statues, planting schemes, piped music, and car-parking. Gruen's vision was to create a shopping atmosphere where people felt so comfortable, they would spend more time in the environment, thereby enhancing opportunities for purchasing. The first of these malls opened at Northland Mall near Detroit in 1954. He went on to design some 50 such malls. Due to the success of the mall concept, Gruen was described as \\"the most influential architect of the twentieth century by a journalist in the New Yorker.\\"Malcolm Gladwell, The Terrazzo Jungle, The New Yorker, March 15, 2004 Throughout the twentieth century, a trend towards larger store footprints became discernible. The average size of a U.S. supermarket grew from square feet in 1991 to square feet in 2000. In 1963, Carrefour opened the first hypermarket in St Genevieve-de-Bois, near Paris, France.Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, p. 83 By the end of the twentieth century, stores were using labels such as \\"mega-stores\\" and \\"warehouse\\" stores to reflect their growing size. In Australia, for example, the popular hardware chain, Bunnings has shifted from smaller \\"home centres\\" (retail floor space under ) to \\"warehouse\\" stores (retail floor space between and ) in order to accommodate a wider range of goods and in response to population growth and changing consumer preferences. The upward trend of increasing retail space was not consistent across nations and led in the early 21st century to a 2-fold difference in square footage per capita between the United States and Europe. As the 21st century takes shape, some indications suggest that large retail stores have come under increasing pressure from online sales models and that reductions in store size are evident.Wetherell, S., \\"The Shopping Mall‚Äôs Socialist Pre-History\\", Jacobin Magazine, 4 August 2014 Under such competition and other issues such as business debt, there has been a noted business disruption called the retail apocalypse in recent years which several retail businesses, especially in North America, are sharply reducing their number of stores, or going out of business entirely.

In an electrostatic septum, basically an electric field septum, two separate areas can be identified, one with an electric field and a field free region. The two areas are separated by a physical wall that is called the septum. An important feature of septa is to have a homogeneous field in the gap and no field in the region of the circulating beam. The basic principle Electrostatic septa provide an electric field in the direction of extraction, by applying a voltage between the septum foil and an electrode. The septum foil is very thin to have the least interaction with the beam when it is slowly extracted. Slowly means over millions of turns of the particles in the synchrotron. The orbiting beam generally passes through the hollow support of the septum foil, which ensures a field free region, as not to affect the circulating beam. The field free region is achieved by using the hollow support of the septum and the septum foil itself as a Faraday cage. The extracted beam passes just on the other side of the septum, where the electric field changes the direction of the beam to be extracted. The septum separates the gap field between the electrode and the foil from the field free region for the circulating beam. Electrostatic septa are always sitting in a vacuum tank to allow high electric fields, since the vacuum works as an insulator between the septum and high voltage electrode. To allow precise matching of the septum position with the circulation beam trajectory, the septum is often fitted with a displacement system, which allows parallel and angular displacement with respect to the circulating beam. Great difficulty lies in the choice of materials and the manufacturing techniques of the different components. In the figure a typical cross section of an electrostatic septum is shown. The septum foil and its support are marked in blue, while the electrode is marked in red. In the lower part of the figure the electric field E is shown as it could be measured on the axis indicated as a dotted line in the cross section. The field free region is inside the support of the septum foil. The electric field E in the gap between the septum foil and the electrode is homogeneous on the axis and is equal to: : E = - \\\\frac{V}{d} Where V is the voltage applied to the electrode and d is the distance between the septum foil and the electrode. Typical technical specifications Typical device specifications are listed below. * Electrode length: 500 - 3000 mm * Gap width: variable between 10 - 35 mm * Septum thickness: 0.1 mm * Vacuum: (10-9 to 10-12 mbar range) * Electric field strength: up to 15 MV/m * Voltage: up to 300 kV * Septum materials: Molybdenum foil, Tungsten Rhenium alloy wires, Tungsten Rhenium alloy ribbons * Electrode materials: stainless steel, anodised aluminium or titanium for extreme low vacuum applications * Bakeable up to 200 ¬∞C for low vacuum applications * Power supplied by high voltage Cockcroft‚ÄìWalton generator  References  Category:Accelerator physics  Electrostatic Septum  ","title":"Electrostatic septum"},{"id":"62279569","text":"John Marius Rodenburg One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: is Professor in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Sheffield.

These artists were Howard Chaykin, Walt Simonson, Val Mayerik, and Jim Starlin. The membership of the studio changed over time, eventually adding James Sherman, Frank Miller, and Gary Hallgren as previous members left (there were never more than four studio members at any one time). In addition, future comics professionals Peter Kuper and Dean Haspiel worked as assistants at Upstart before they began getting professional work. Some of the most notable comics of the early 1980s were produced at Upstart, including Chaykin's American Flagg!, Simonson's run on Thor, and Miller's run on Daredevil. In addition, while at Upstart, Chaykin and Simonson created a series of humorous one-pagers for Heavy Metal magazine called Shakespeare for Americans. Upstart disbanded in the late 1980s.

The incident primarily involves the Produce 101 series and Idol School, which were intended to create K-pop groups with members selected by audience vote. In July 2019, during the final episode of the Produce 101 series' fourth season, Produce X 101, several viewers suspected that the total votes were manipulated after noticing numerical patterns. On August 1, 2019, 272 viewers filed a lawsuit against Mnet, as their on-site text voting service charged per vote, prompting an investigation led by the Seoul Metropolitan Police. Ahn Joon-young and Kim Yong-bum, producers for the Produce 101 series, were arrested on November 5, 2019. Ahn later admitted to manipulating the rankings to all four seasons of the Produce 101 series. On December 3, 2019, Ahn, Kim, and six other entertainment agency representatives were indicted for charges including obstruction of business, fraud, and bribery. A court trial began on December 20, 2019. The investigation has affected promotions for the groups produced by Mnet's franchises, such as Iz*One and X1, as well as public perception of Mnet's ongoing competition reality series. Background In 2009, South Korean cable television channel Mnet produced their first reality competition series, Superstar K, which immediately became popular, creating a boom of audition program franchises. In 2016, they launched Produce 101, aiming to create a short-term K-pop project group of 101 contestants with all 11 members selected by audience vote. The group formed from that show, I.O.I, was successful throughout their 1-year contract, and due to their popularity, Mnet subsequently continued the series, creating its own franchise. The next two seasons, Produce 101 Season 2 and Produce 48 (a collaboration with the AKB48 Group), formed Wanna One and Iz*One respectively, with both groups finding individual success in the music market. The fourth season, Produce X 101, which was broadcast in 2019, created the group X1. In addition to the Produce 101 series, Mnet launched Idol School in 2017 with a similar premise, which created the girl group Fromis 9. Investigation =Incident and lawsuit= During the live broadcast of the final episode of Produce X 101 on July 19, 2019, several viewers suspected that Mnet had tampered with the total votes after noticing some of the final rankings were multiples of 7494. In response to the allegations, Mnet admitted that there were errors in calculation, but also maintained that the final rankings were correct and that there was no intention of changing X1's member line-up. Fourteen representatives from the entertainment agencies of the 20 finalists held a meeting on July 29, 2019, and agreed to support Produce X 101's outcome and X1's debut. On August 1, 2019, 272 viewers filed a lawsuit against Mnet for electoral fraud, as their on-site text voting service charged per vote. =First police raids and witness allegations= On August 20, 2019, a search warrant was issued on CJ E&M; offices and a text voting company by the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. During their first search, the police uncovered voice recordings of the staff members discussing vote manipulation on the previous seasons of the show, resulting in them extending their investigation to all four seasons of the Produce 101 series, Idol School, Show Me the Money, and Superstar K. Produce X 101 On October 1, 2019, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency confirmed that votes from eliminated trainees were added to the total votes of the members who debuted in X1, a process that affected 2-3 trainees who were originally in the top 11. The police issued a search and seizure warrant on the offices of Starship Entertainment, Woollim Entertainment, and MBK Entertainment. The police also investigated several agencies involved in Produce 48. Reportedly, per contract signed with CJ E&M;, the entertainment agencies were paid for every episode their talent appeared in. An anonymous trainee alleged only was given to their talent agencies for participating in a song, while each participant would only get a small percentage, and CJ E&M; would keep additional profits if the song performed well. Some entertainment agencies who disagreed would request their talents to be eliminated at the last minute to withdraw them. On October 15, 2019, MBC broadcast a feature on the vote rigging controversy on PD Note. Participants of Produce X 101 and Idol School and agency officials alleged anonymously that the production teams were biased towards trainees they preferred, such as forcing song producers to give certain trainees more lines and providing them with more screen time; one of them alleged that a contestant had his screen time completely removed after raising a complaint against a staff member, who had yelled at him to wake up. An anonymous trainee alleged that one trainee, under pressure from Starship Entertainment, was secretly informed about a mission in advance by one of the choreographers. He also alleged that some trainees knew the final rankings before the results were announced, and that a trainee from Woollim Entertainment was told by a representative that only one person from their company would debut in X1. Two trainees alleged that the center position for the theme song, \\"X1-MA\\", was originally assigned to a different contestant chosen by trainee vote before the producers changed it to audience vote at the last minute. A fourth trainee claimed that many participants felt the show was biased towards trainees from Starship Entertainment. Staff members anonymously alleged that, for the final ranking results, only one off-site producer had counted the votes in a separate room and sent them the results via text message. Idol School On October 3, 2019, a trainee of Idol School alleged anonymously that only three to four of the 4,000 applicants had auditioned to appear on the show, indicating that the majority of the contestants did not have to go through an audition process to compete. In an interview with MBC, a trainee alleged that, throughout their six-month training period, the contestants were only given clothes appropriate for the summer and had to wear them in cold weather. In addition to that, they were cut off from outside communication, were only allowed to buy daily necessities once a month, and were not given enough food to eat. During the October 15 broadcast of PD Note, several trainees anonymously claimed that their living quarters had poor ventilation and some girls developed rashes from dust. The trainees also claimed that they were so malnourished that some of them did not menstruate or had periods lasting for two months. =Bribery investigation, arrests, and indictments= On October 16, 2019, the police began investigating whether the producers had accepted money for manipulating the votes. On November 5, 2019, after approval from the Seoul National District Court, the police issued arrest warrants and travel bans for director Ahn Joon-young, chief producer Kim Yong-bum, a producer with the surname Lee, and Starship Entertainment's vice president Kim Kang-hyo, after they had attempted to destroy evidence. By evening, Ahn and Kim Yong-bum were arrested. During questioning, Ahn initially admitted to having manipulated the rankings for Produce 48 and Produce X 101 only, but he later also admitted to partially manipulating the rankings for the first two seasons as well. On November 7, 2019, the police revealed that the final rankings of the top 20 trainees during Produce 48 and Produce X 101 had already been predetermined by the producers before the final performances were recorded and broadcast. A total of 10 people, including the previously reported four individuals, were arrested on November 12, 2019. One of the other six people arrested was Shin Hyung-kwan, the vice president of CJ ENM. On December 3, 2019, Ahn, Kim Yong- bum, and Lee were indicted for obstruction of business and fraud; executives Kim Shi-dae and Kim from Starship Entertainment, former Woollim Entertainment employee Lee, former 8D Creative employee Ryu, and Around Us Entertainment employee Kim were indicted for bribery and violating the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act. The indictment revealed that Ahn and Kim Yong-bum had met with one other professional two days before the live finale of Produce X 101 to determine the final 11 members of X1 based on pre-finale online votes and had wanted to exclude contestants they did not prefer, particularly those who had already debuted in other groups. Ahn and Kim Yong-bum held a similar meeting in August 2018 before the live finale of Produce 48 to choose Iz*One's final 12 members. Ahn swapped rankings for one trainee who was supposed to debut in Wanna One. A later report mentioned that the indictment also revealed rankings for one trainee who was supposed to debut in I.O.I were swapped. In addition to this, Ahn had also swapped rankings for other contestants in the earlier evaluations. One trainee from Produce X 101 had originally passed the first elimination had been swapped for another, while the same method was used for the third elimination. He also swapped rankings for two trainees from Produce 101 and one trainee from Produce 101 Season 2, all of whom had originally passed the first elimination. Ahn and Kim Yong-bum stated in the indictment that they had predetermined the line-up for Iz*One and X1 because they were pressured by Wanna One's success. CJ ENM had earned from the paid text messaging votes from Produce 48 and Produce X 101. Police previously found that Ahn had been using services from adult entertainment establishments in Gangnam paid for by various talent agencies approximately 40 times beginning from the second half of 2018, estimating to . The indictment, however, clarified that, from January 2018 to July 2019, Ahn received services 47 times, estimating , that were paid for by the five talent agency representatives in exchange for giving their trainees favorable screentime. In response to this report, 8D Creative stated that Ryu was no longer working for their agency and was being indicted for bribery on Produce X 101 through his own agency, Enfant Terrible. Around Us Entertainment stated that their employee Kim purchased alcohol for Ahn but they were not involved in bribery. On February 14, 2020, the Seoul Metropolitan Police issued arrest warrants for two people who were on the production staff of Idol School. Trial The first trial was held on December 20, 2019. During the trial, the defendants admitted to the charges while also requesting a closed trial to avoid disclosing the names of the trainees whose rankings were changed. A second trial was held on January 14, 2020 and attended by the legal representatives of the defendants and the prosecution. Ahn and Kim, through their legal team, maintained that while they manipulated the rankings, their actions were not illegal. Han Dong-chul, the chief producer of the first season of Produce 101, and a staff member with the surname Park appeared at the hearing as witnesses; both had been suspected of manipulating the rankings for the first season of the show. The prosecution requested Lee Hae-in and another Produce 101 season 1 contestant as witnesses, but Lee's summoning was delayed and her lawyer stated that she would appear at the next hearing. Han and Park were also scheduled to be interrogated at the next hearing. On February 7, 2020, all eight defendants were present. Ahn and Kim's lawyer stated that the votes were rigged in favor of the trainees from the first two seasons wanting to leave the program. In addition, Ahn claimed that while he violated the Improper Solitication and Graft Act, he only drank with entertainment agency representatives without accepting bribes, a statement that was supported by the other defendants. The third hearing was took place on March 6, 2020.  Sentencing  Final arguments were heard on 12 May 2020 with the prosecution requesting prison sentences of three years each for producing director (PD) Ahn Joon-young and chief producer (CP) Kim Yong-bum; two years for assistant PD Lee Mi-kyung; and one year for each of the five agency representatives charged with collusion. The sentencing hearing took place on 29 May at Seoul District Court; all eight defendants heard guilty verdicts. PD Ahn Joon-young was fined ‚Ç©37 million and sentenced to two years; CP Kim Yong- beom was sentenced to 20 months; and assistant PD Lee Mi-kyung was fined ‚Ç©10 million. Agency representatives identified only as \\"Kim\\", \\"Lee\\", and \\"Ryu\\" were fined ‚Ç©7 million apiece, while two additional representatives both identified as \\"Kim\\" were each fined ‚Ç©5 million. Reactions =Mnet's response= Mnet issued an apology after the vote investigation allegations first broke in July 2019. Despite the backlash, in the midst of investigation, Mnet announced on October 21, 2019 that they were launching another reality competition series, Teen Singer, in 2020. On November 5, 2019, Mnet issued a statement mentioning that they were cooperating with the police after arrest warrants were issued. Following Ahn Joon-young and Kim Yong-bum's arrests, Mnet stated that their current and future reality programs, such as Queendom and Teen Singer, will be implementing an \\"observer system\\", where ordinary people and third parties will be overseeing the votes. In addition, their current program, World Klass, is implementing a system where winners will be selected through evaluations from industry experts and V Live votes, while removing paid text message voting. On November 18, 2019, Mnet announced they were withdrawing all four seasons of the Produce 101 series from video on demand services. On December 3, 2019, Mnet issued another apology regarding the results of the investigation and announced that they will soon disclose future plans for Iz*One and X1. On December 18, 2019, Kang Ji-hoon, the contents operation manager at Mnet, announced that Mnet will no longer be producing audition programs and were discussing how to compensate trainees who were unfairly eliminated. =Impact on music acts= After the lawsuit was filed in August 2019, several brands cancelled their endorsement deals with X1 or put them on hold. The agencies of several of the members refused to sign contracts with CJ ENM until the allegations were cleared up. In spite of this, X1's debut proceeded as planned. After their appearance at the 2019 V Live Awards V Heartbeat was cancelled, Mnet announced that there were currently no plans for the group to promote. Iz*One's first studio album, Bloom*Iz, was originally scheduled for release on November 11, 2019 with the lead single \\"Fiesta\\". Both the album and song were postponed after Ahn Joon-young's questioning on November 6. In addition, Iz*One's showcases, promotions, and several guest appearances were cancelled or put on hold, as well as their concert film, Eyes on Me: The Movie. On November 28, 2019, Iz*One's Japanese promotions were also suspended, including Sakura Miyawaki and Hitomi Honda's individual radio shows. On December 4, 2019, Iz*One's official Japanese fan club suspended activity, closing registrations for new members and refunding current members. On December 30, 2019, Mnet and CJ ENM announced that both Iz*One and X1 will begin discussing future plans for the groups, and that the eliminated trainees will be fairly compensated.{{Cite webtitle=mneturl= https://metro.co.uk/2019/12/06/nuests-jr-dropped-wanna-one-line-x1-izone- members-pre-decided-produce-101-11280783/ Both Iz*One and X1 were dropped from the nominations for the 34th Golden Disc Awards. On January 6, 2020, X1 disbanded after the members' agencies failed to reach an agreement on the group's future, while the agencies of Iz*One's members agreed to continue promoting. =Public response= Following initial accusations in July 2019, politician Ha Tae-kyung condemned Mnet, stating that some of the numbers had a low probability of naturally occurring. On October 17, 2019, Korea Communications Standards Commission revealed that they may fine Mnet up to for violating the Enforcement Decree of the Broadcasting Act. The production committee for Produce 101 Japan, the 2019 Japanese spin-off of the original Produce 101 franchise, stated on their official website that they are not affiliated with the Korean production team and have a separate voting system, with votes analyzed by a group of third-party lawyers. After Ahn Joon-young admitted the first two seasons of the show was rigged, an image that Mnet had posted on their official Facebook account coinciding with the finale of Produce 101 Season 2 went viral. The image had originally included Kang Dong- ho, Samuel Kim, and Kim Jong-hyun as the winners of the show instead of Yoon Ji-sung, Kim Jae-hwan and Ha Sung-woon, but Mnet had stated it was a mistake and deleted it shortly after posting it. Responses from contestants In October 2019, the father of Lee Hae-in, a contestant on the first season of Produce 101 and Idol School, alleged through her fan site that CJ ENM suggested during her audition that she sign with their subsidiary agency to ensure that she would be able to debut after elimination, and she had done so out of fear of not being accepted into Idol School . However, after being eliminated, CJ ENM did not follow up and she was unable to sign contracts with other agencies. In response, CJ ENM issued an apology. Following the news, Lee revealed on Instagram and on the October 15 broadcast of PD Note the poor conditions she and other contestants worked under. After Ahn Joon-young and Kim Yong-bum's arrests, Shiori Niwa, another contestant of the first season, posted and later deleted tweets alleging that the first season may be manipulated, as she noticed that some of the trainees already knew the lyrics and choreography to \\"Pick Me\\" by the time she heard it. Jung Dong-soo, a contestant of Produce 101 Season 2, called for the culprits to be punished and later stated that, while he had suspected the ranks were manipulated, he was \\"shocked\\" and \\"angry\\". At the same time, both voiced support for all trainees in the show. Lee Dae-hwi and Park Hee-seok, who were also contestants on Produce 101 Season 2, voiced their support for Iz*One and X1.

Life He was the eldest son of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath and his wife Isabella Elizabeth Byng, daughter of George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington; he held a courtesy title, and since he predeceased his father, it was lifelong. He was educated at Eton College, and studied at St John's College, Cambridge from 1814 to 1816. After leaving Cambridge, he took on a junior diplomatic post with Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty, on the continent of Europe; but Clancarty was not impressed with his ability. In the 1818 United Kingdom general election, Viscount Weymouth stood for . This was a rotten borough, the family having obtained complete control of it in 1754. He was therefore elected uncontested, with Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, a nephew of the Marquess, as the second member. He supported Lord Liverpool's administration, without speaking in the House of Commons. Weymouth did not stand again in the 1820 United Kingdom general election, by that time having clashed with his father over his friends and heavy debts. Lord John Thynne, his uncle, and the lawyer Henry Broughton, managed a reconciliation in February 1820, between the death of George III and the election it triggered, but it was only temporary. Weymouth's elopement took him abroad, in May. There was no later reconciliation with his father, and indeed Weymouth brought a chancery suit against him in 1828. His mother the Marchioness did visit Weymouth and his wife Harriet in Paris, in 1830. He died on 16 January 1837, as a tenant at Shanks House, Cucklington on the Somerset‚ÄìDorset boundary, at age 40, five weeks before the Marquess. Family Weymouth married on 11 May 1820 Harriet Matilda Robbins, daughter of Thomas Robbins. This was against his family's wishes, and they travelled first to Italy. After his death, she married again to Count Inghirami; she died at Florence on 18 June 1873. At the time of her death, she was described as the Hon. Enrichetta, Countess Inghirami (formerly Viscountess Weymouth). It was considered a \\"disgraceful marriage\\", to the daughter of a toll keeper near Longleat, if a beauty. There is, however, conflicting evidence. A monumental inscription on Harriet's grave describes her as sister of the Rev.

It folded due to funding problems and allegations of Communist sympathies; its successor was the former sub-group the Education Fund. History =Background= Eleanor Roosevelt (here, in 1938 with George T. Bye upper right, Deems Taylor upper left, Westbrook Pegler lower left) embraced the SCHW During latter years of the Great Depression), US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) recognized that many New Deal programs were failing in the US South. In 1938, he convened a group of southern, liberal scholars and writers to investigate conditions. Their investigation resulted in A Report on the Economic Conditions of the South, calling the South \\"the nation's number one economic problem\\" based on low wages (and resulting low incomes) as well as public services. Two members of the group were Joseph Gelders, an organizer for the CPUSA's International Labor Defense, and Lucy Randolph Mason, scion of the famed Randolph family of Virginia, then public-relations representative for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (\\"CIO\\") in the South. They advocated for a regional conference \\"to address the repression of civil liberties in southern cities,\\" which both FDR and wife Eleanor Roosevelt embraced. =Founding= alt= On November 20, 1938, the Southern Conference for Human Welfare convened for the first time in the Municipal Auditorium of Birmingham, Alabama. Attendees numbered 1,200, a quarter of whom were African American. They included: United States Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black; Works Progress Administration director Aubrey Willis Williams, civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune, Highlander Folk School co-founder James Dombrowski, Alabama governor Bibb Graves, and activist Virginia Foster Durr. SCHW's \\"interracial nature was particularly unsettling for many white southerners\\" and experienced disruption by segregationists, leading to negative publicity in local newspapers. =Activities= Many politicians soon left the SCHW due to public perception as a Communist front. In her memoir, Virginia Durr recalled that the SCHW was \\"red-baited constantly.\\" Attackers included prominent New York lawyer Morris Ernst of both the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and National Lawyers Guild (NLG)‚Äìwhere Ernst had also led internal anti-communist efforts. SCHW also experienced a \\"chronic shortage\\" of funding. It cancelled its 1939 convention. It had a hard time paying meager salaries to staff. After the end of World War II, celebrities (e.g., Frank Sinatra, Orson Welles) helped raise funding, which led to creation of a subsidiary Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), an educational and non-political arm, headed by James Dombrowski of the Highlander Folk School. As SCEF formed, membership in SCHW declined. Labor unions, e.g., the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the CIO, already facing pressure from new regulations in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, distanced themselves from the SCHW as a Communist-tainted, radical organization. Meanwhile, the SCHW refused to take a clear anti-Communist stance, which left it exposed to investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) (and earlier Dies Committee). Even \\"stalwart supporters\\" like Eleanor Roosevelt distanced themselves. =Disbanding= During 1948, the SCHW split over its support for presidential candidate: some members supported Progressive Party candidate Henry A. Wallace, others the Democratic Party's incumbent US President Harry S. Truman. SCHW officers met in November 1948 and voted to end the floundering organization. On November 20, 1948, SCHW leaders met at Monticello, Virginia and passed a resolution to reformulate the organizations's last remaining group, the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), \\"committed solely to the ending of segregation in the south.\\" Next day, November 21, 1948, SCHW leaders voted to disband.

It was published by Avon on December 1, 1997 and was selected for the Oprah Winfrey Book Club in 1998 and was a New York Times Best Seller for nine straight weeks.What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day marks Pearl Cleage's first published novel and it is followed by the 2001 novel I Wish I Had a Red Dress. The novel depicts the life of a young African-American woman named Ava Johnson in the following months after being diagnosed with HIV; in addition to the realities of living with a retrovirus, Cleage's work addresses issues involving race, sexuality, gender, class, and ability in American society.  Plot summary  The novel is separated into five parts: June, July, August, September, and November. =June= Ava Johnson, a young black woman living in Atlanta, is diagnosed with HIV which she contracted from an unknown source through sexual intercourse. Upon her HIV-positive diagnosis, she is alienated by her community in Atlanta and loses her clients at her hair salon on the basis of people's fear of the virus and their association of it with AIDS. Ava decides to move to Idlewild, Michigan, her hometown, to live with her widowed sister Joyce before fulfilling her dream to start a new life in San Francisco, California. When Ava arrives at the Grand Rapids airport, Joyce's close friend Eddie Jefferson comes to pick her up because Joyce is busy taking care of a young woman in labor. At Ava's request, Eddie and Ava stop at a liquor store on the way home from the airport. While in the parking lot of the liquor store, Eddie and Ava witness a violent dispute between a young man, Frank, and his girlfriend who have a young son together. Eddie manages to deescalate the fight by punching Frank in the Adam's apple, a skill which is revealed he learned from serving in the Army. After witnessing the fight and dropping the woman and the baby back off at their house, Eddie reveals to Ava that there is a budding crack problem within Idlewild. Once Ava and Eddie arrive at Joyce's house, Ava discovers that Joyce redecorated the entire house with shades of blue because of a magazine article she read that claimed it was a healing color. Once Joyce returns home, she tells Ava that the woman she was assisting in labor was a crack addict and that the baby will be tested for HIV. The following day, Ava and Joyce, find out that the baby tested negative for HIV; however, the mother left the hospital without the baby. Since the baby is orphaned, Joyce decides that she wants to personally care for the baby; upon making this decision, her and Ava head to Mattie's house, the aunt of the baby, to receive permission. Once the two reach the house, they are met by siblings Mattie and Frank, who tell Joyce that they do not wish to keep the baby. Joyce decides that she wants to find the baby a temporary home; in the meantime, the baby is taken back to the hospital. Joyce reveals to Ava that she leads a group of young teenage mothers at the local church in a weekly group meeting called the Sewing Circus. While the group was initially formed in order to offer Sunday morning nursery care for the mothers, the group evolved into being a group discussion of any issue the girls are struggling with in their daily lives. As a social worker, Joyce uses the Sewing Circus as an opportunity to empower and especially educate young women. While the group is a positive outlet for young women in the community, the topics discussed in the group, such as birth control, do not sit well with the Reverend and the Reverend's wife, Gerry Anderson. The hospital decides that Joyce is allowed to take temporary custody of the baby; once Joyce brings the baby home, she decides to name the baby Imani meaning \\"faith\\" in Swahili. Eddie and Ava continue to deepen their friendship; however, Ava fears that any sort of romantic relationship is off-limits due to her HIV-positive diagnosis. =July= Come July, Joyce is met with the news from Gerry Anderson that the Sewing Circus is not allowed to meet at the Church anymore because it does not align with their conservative values. Although upset by Gerry and the Reverend's decision, Joyce is unsurprised by its removal from the Church grounds. When Ava goes to the town pharmacy to pick-up her HIV medication, she finds out that the pharmacist revealed her diagnosis to some members of the town including Gerry. In turn, Ava is faced with ridicule and judgement from some of the community upon the news from the pharmacist. In response to the banning of the Sewing Circus from the Church, Joyce holds the meeting at her house and the turn-out is higher than it ever was at the Church leading Joyce to the idea that the group will need a larger meeting space. Later that night, Ava goes to Eddie's house where he tells her about his past serving in the army in Vietnam. The following night, Ava and Eddie begin to watch Menace II Society together until Eddie decides that he can't watch it anymore; upon telling Ava this, he reveals to her his violent past involving drugs and a ten year sentence to prison for murder. While shaken up by the news of Eddie's past, she maintains her relationship with him and decides to reveal her HIV- positive diagnosis to him a few nights later. Eddie is accepting of Ava's diagnosis and the two begin a romantic relationship together; however, they must take certain precautions during sex to protect Eddie from contracting HIV. =August= With the news that an old man in Idlewild is putting his house up for sale for ten thousand dollars cash, Eddie proposes that the house would be a good relocation for the Sewing Circus meetings. From money she saved up at the salon, Ava pays for the house and her Joyce and Eddie begin renovations. However, Joyce receives a letter from the state government that the Sewing Circus will no longer receive funding. The state's decision to discontinue funding resulted from a letter Gerry Anderson sent the government with false information about the Sewing Circus. While Joyce heads to defend the right to funding for the Sewing Circus, Ava cares for Imani. One night while Joyce is away, Ava witnesses Frank and Tyrone pull into Joyce's driveway and have sex with Frank's girlfriend on top of the car. Before they drive away, Frank throws a beer bottle at Joyce's house, shattering her window. Although Eddie wants to put Frank and Tyrone in their place, Ava urges him to not do anything drastic. After Ava and Eddie file a complaint at the sheriff's office, Tyrone and Frank tell the sheriff that Ava intentionally tried to seduce them; the sheriff does not believe Ava's story. In an effort to resolve the issues between Joyce and the Anderson's, Ava and Joyce go to the Anderson's house to talk about their issues with the Sewing Circus; however, Ava and Joyce are only met by the Reverend who is unable to have a proper discussion due to his drunkenness. While painting the new house for the Sewing Circus, Eddie proposes to Ava unto which Ava decides to take a few days to process this possibility of a new life. When Mattie arrives to Joyce's house with a social worker, Joyce reluctantly agrees to give Imani back to Mattie for the weekend prior to a hearing on the following Monday to determine Imani's official home. =September= While Imani is at Mattie's house for the weekend, Joyce convinces Ava to go with her to the house in case there are signs that Imani is in trouble. After hearing Imani's screams from outside the house, Ava and Joyce break in to find out that Frank twisted Imani's legs and broke them. After being rushed to the hospital, Imani's legs are put into casts and the doctors assure Joyce and Ava that she will be okay. Upon meeting a woman who was a member of the Anderson's old Church in Chicago, Ava finds out that Reverend Anderson fled the city after allegations of sexual interactions with young boys of the parish arose. With this information, Ava confronts Gerry Anderson and threatens to publicize the allegations in Idlewild; with this threat, both Gerry and the Reverend leave town. =November/Epilogue= In the epilogue, Ava reveals that Imani's casts were removed and she's doing well. Frank and Mattie finally get caught by the police after committing several drug-related robberies. Since the Anderson's left town, the church inducts a new pastor, Sister Judith, who is received well by the community. With Sister Judith officiating, Eddie and Ava get married.  Setting  The majority of the plot takes place in Idlewild, Michigan during the 1990s.

Reception  Author Bryan Aubrey has noted that the novel showcases the empowerment of women in the face of undeniably difficult life challenges and that Cleage's focus on the challenges associated with AIDS, drug addiction, and domestic violence offer an intuitive look into the realities of social issues that are dealt with at surface level by traditional societal institutions. He has further noted that it could be seen as a self-help book as it depicts Ava steadily making positive life changes in her diet, exercise, spiritual presence, and substance use. Frances Henderson in turn felt that Cleage's portrayal of Ava taking part in a reverse migration, returning to one's homestead, had a connection to longstanding traditions in African American Literature of characters returning to their roots in order to sort out the challenges in their lives. Concerning Cleage's discussion of gender relations, Barbara Valle has highlighted the portrayal of \\"cosmic confusion\\" between men and women In the same vein, Loverlie and Erin King interpret the novel as a \\"healing romance\\" because of its insistence on the idea that the healing of the challenges faced by African-American people require the cooperation of both men and women. Authors, Erin King and Lovalerie King, praised Cleage's work for depicting a story about HIV/AIDS in a humorous way. Timothy Lyle commends Cleage's work for bringing awareness to HIV positive African-American women. In a feature in \\"Voice from the Gaps\\" at University of Minnesota, Cleage's work is praised for depicting an alternative representation of motherhood and the struggles that come along with it. The novel received some critical response by Bryan Aubrey on the basis of Ava's character transitioning from an outspoken, unpredictable character to one who makes predictable decisions based on political and spiritual correctness. Aubrey compares the representation of Ava's newfound happiness in life to the ideology of magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour which assert that people's lives will drastically improve once they start performing \\"anti-stress\\" activities. The novel has been critically compared to Animal Dreams (1990) for characterizing a male protagonist as having very little flaws. Aubrey Bryan argues that the portrayal of Eddie Jefferson as a near perfect individual lends the novel to be more instructional rather than realistic with multi-dimensional characters. Timothy Lyle critiques the novel's reliance on responding to adverse life situations with the response of heteronormative practices, \\"gender compliance,\\" and \\"able-bodied productivity.\\" Lyle also argues that Cleage's work reinforces problematic interpretations of blackness which set rigid expectations for what blackness is and what it is not; Lyle argues that Cleage controversially asserts that Ava's character, an HIV positive black woman, must show \\"signs of potential rehabilitation\\" and maintain a likable personality in order to regain acceptance in the black community.  Themes  = Coming-home = The novel closely associates rehabilitation with the idea of \\"coming-home\\" to one's place of origin in order to find love, community, and purpose amidst a threatening life situation. = Adversity = The novel emphasizes finding happiness in the face of adversity. With Joyce experiencing the loss of a husband, Ava receiving an HIV positive diagnosis, Eartha's tragic loss of both her parents, and Eddie's struggle with violence and PTSD, the novel works to depict characters finding purpose and happiness in the face of adverse life situations. In order to find happiness in light of these situations, Cleage implies the importance of the use of \\"spiritual practices\\" in order to reform one's personal issues into acceptance and find peace in the practice of compassion for others.  Depiction of HIV/AIDS  Cleage's portrayal of Ava's HIV diagnosis as well as its inclusion of sex-education has received some criticism for its inaccurate depiction of the realities of the disease as well as the logistics of preventing its contraction in HIV- discordant relationships, which are relationships where one partner is HIV- positive and one is not In an analysis of Cleage's work, Timothy Lyle proposes that Cleage takes part in cultural sanitizing, a practice in which an author problematically molds a taboo subject into a socially acceptable narrative. Lyle attributes the success of the novel to Cleage's depiction of a heterosexual African-American with HIV into a pleasurable narrative in which Ava's \\"threatening\\" diagnosis is ultimately accepted back into able-bodied heteronormativity. Cleage's depiction of an HIV inflicted African-American is criticized by Lyle as it alludes to the idea that an HIV inflicted individual must \\"soap up\\" and \\"scrub down\\" in order to regain acceptance in general society. Ayana Weekley argues that respectability politics, the phenomenon of dominant figures in marginalized groups aligning their values with the dominant values of the majority, mold the discourse of race, gender, and sexuality in relation to the interrogation of the HIV/AIDs epidemic in Cleage's work.

Kane, No 11-mj-00001 (D. Nev. filed Jan. 19, 2011), is a court case where a software bug in a video poker machine was exploited to win several hundred thousand dollars. Central to the case was whether a video poker machine constituted a protected computer and whether the exploitation of a software bug constituted exceeding authorized access under Title 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(4) of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Ultimately, the Court ruled that the government‚Äôs argument failed to sufficiently meet the ‚Äúexceeding authorized access‚Äù requirement of Title 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(4) moving to approve the Defendants‚Äô Motions to Dismiss. This case is noteworthy because it upheld the precedent established by the Ninth Circuit‚Äôs decision in United States v. Nosal, 676 F.3d 854 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc), with the magistrate calling the government‚Äôs argument directly analogous to the government‚Äôs argument in Nosal, further asserting that the CFAA does not regulate the way individuals use the information they are otherwise authorized to access.  Background  In early April 2009, John Kane discovered a software bug in a video poker game which, following a ‚Äúcomplex combination of game changes, bill insertions and cash outs‚Äù, would allow him to access previous winning hands and trigger a jackpot. Following this discovery, Kane then contacted Andre Nestor who flew out to meet Kane and joined him in exploiting this bug for profit. The two continued this for nearly five months, from April 2009 to September 2009. Suspicions were raised on July 3, 2009, when Kane won five jackpots, each with 820-1 odds, in under an hour at the Silverton Casino Lodge. Following this, two engineers from Nevada‚Äôs Gaming Control Board were called in to inspect the machine for foul play. Here, having analyzed the machine‚Äôs logic tray and EEPROM, the engineers discovered the previously-unknown firmware bug which Kane had been exploiting to win the jackpot payouts. Subsequently, both Kane and Nestor were later arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and violating Title 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(4) of the CFAA on allegations that they exceeded authorized access to a protected computer in furtherance of fraud.  Court findings  Following their Indictment, the Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, moving the Court to dismiss the charges alleging violations under Title 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(4), arguing that ‚Äúeven accepting all of the Government‚Äôs factual allegations as true, the Government has failed to state a cognizable offense under the law.‚Äù The Court sided with this Motion to Dismiss, concluding that the Defendants had not violated Title 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(4), for a video poker game does not constitute a protected computer under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(2)(B) nor did their actions exceed authorized access under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(6). = Protected computer =  Computer  Addressing the Defendants claim that video poker machines are not ‚Äúprotected computers‚Äù, the Court first defined a computer to having the meaning given by 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(1) (the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act), which states a computer is an: > ‚Äúelectronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high-speed data > processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and > includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly > related to or operating in conjunction with such device‚Äù Kane, in his reply, argued that due to their lack of keyboards, network connection, and ability to read or accept new information, video poker machines should thereby be excluded from this provision, highlighting 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(1) which continued to state that: > ‚Äúsuch term does not include an automated typewriter or typesetter, a > portable hand held calculator, or other similar device.‚Äù However, whilst the Court acknowledged the exceptions listed in this provision, the Court argued that video poker machines are not ‚Äúsufficiently similar‚Äù to an automated typewriter or typesetter or a portable hand held calculator to qualify for exclusion. Consequently, the Court held that the video poker machines perform functions that directly align it with what constitutes a computer under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(1).  Protected computer  Having concluded that video poker machines are computers, the Court then sought to address the Defendants claim that such machines are not ‚Äúprotected computers‚Äù. Row of video poker machines inside Harrah's New Orleans similar to the ones used by Kane. To do this, the Court called upon 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(2)(B), which defined a protected computer as: > ‚Äú[a computer] which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce > or communication, including a computer located outside the United States > that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or > communication of the United States‚Äù The arguments were as follows: # The Defendants, citing Natinonal City bank, N.A. v. Prime lending, Inc., argued that because the video poker machines lacked the ability to connect to the internet, they are not protected computers. However, the Government, citing U.S. v. Mitra, 405 F.3d 492 (7th Cir. 2005), reasoned that while internet connectivity is sufficient in establishing a computer as a protected computer, it is not required. # Addressing this, Kane noted how critical to the Seventh Circuit‚Äôs holding in Mitra was the issue of having operated in a medium of interstate commerce that was within a federally regulated domain. Thus, he argued, Mitra is not applicable to this case, for video poker machines are not subject to federal regulation. [6] The Government refuted this claim, arguing that the Gambling Devices Act of 1962 (15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1171-78) subjugated these devices to federal regulation, therefore they operate within the same regulated domain. # The Government argued that, due to the video poker machines ‚Äúattracting customers from all over the country to Las Vegas‚Äù to play them, they thereby affect interstate commerce. In its ruling, the Court held the following: # The Court sided with the Government in that internet access is not the only way to constitute a computer as a protected computer. # The Court sided with the Defendant for, unlike the radio system in Mitra, a video poker machine has no such capability to transmit, receive, or otherwise communicate information across state lines. ## Additionally, the Court rejected the Government‚Äôs Gambling Devices Act applicability argument, declaring it invalid as this act functioned to merely regulated the shipping and transportation of these devices. Thus, ‚Äúthe machines themselves do not function within those channels as anything more than cargo‚Äù. # The Court held that the Government‚Äôs argument of affecting interstate commerce through the attraction of customers fails for two reasons: ## This proposed effect only holds in the aggregate, as the Government cannot show an individual video poker machine to have such an effect on interstate commerce. ## The basis of this argument derives from having ‚Äúdivorce[d] the function of the device, i.e. logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, from its supposed effects in interstate commerce.‚Äù Emphasizing the need for a more ‚Äútangential relationship to interstate commerce‚Äù, the Court concluded that the video poker machines failed to constitute protected computers as doing so would ‚Äúresult in an unacceptably broad application of the term‚Äù. = Exceeds authorized access =  Access  To address the Defendants claim of not having exceed authorized access the Court first held that the Defendants, due to them having physically \\"interacted with the video poker machines in the manner for which they were designed\\", had accessed the video poker machine.  Exceeds authorized access  Subsequently, the Court defined the term exceeds authorized access using 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(6) which defines the term as: > ‚Äú[accessing] a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain > or alter information in the computer that the accessor is not entitled so to > obtain or alter‚Äù. With the Defendants actions allowing them to obtain previously played hands, the Government argued that they had subsequently ‚Äúobtain[ed] or altered information‚Äù that they were not authorized to access, thereby exceeding their authorized access. However, with the Government having conceded that the Defendants were authorized to play video poker, the Court disagreed with the Government‚Äôs claim, as it effectively sought to criminalize the way the Defendants played the game. Upholding the Ninth Circuit‚Äôs opinion in United States v. Nosal, 676 F.3d 854 (9th Cir. 2012), the Court ruled that the ‚ÄúCFAA does not regulate the way individuals use the information which they are otherwise authorized to access‚Äù as such an application of CFAA would ‚Äútransform whole categories of otherwise innocuous behavior into federal crimes simply because a computer was involved‚Äù. Resultantly, the Court held that the Defendants did not exceed their authorized access. = Ruling = Having affirmed that the video poker machines failed to constitute protected computers and that the Defendants actions failed to constitute exceeding authorized access, the Court concluded that the Defendants‚Äô Motion to Dismiss charges under Title 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(4) should be granted.

The novel is widely considered to be one of the first, if not the first, published piece of black lesbian literature, as it openly features a black lesbian protagonist and an interracial lesbian relationship. Following the story of a black woman named Renay and her love affair with a rich white woman, the novel sets the foreground for the black lesbian genre.  Plot Summary  = Chapters 1-5 = The novel begins with an introduction to Renay's life and a look into her unhappy marriage to Jerome Lee Davis. A young black woman, Renay is a talented pianist, yet only plays for supplemental income in a supper club, called the Peacock Supper Club, a couple of nights a week. After Jerome Lee strikes her, Renay and her young daughter Denise leave him and move in with Terry Bluvard, Renay's new romantic interest, a wealthy white lesbian that she met at her work. Although the 'present day' in the novel begins with Renay's moving in with Terry, much of the novel is recounted in Renay's recountings of past events. Renay discusses her meeting of Jerome Lee, a popular and athletic football star, while in college. Jerome Lee courted Renay incessantly, but has no success until she is accused of perhaps not liking men, which is when she succumbs to a date with him. At the end of one of their dates, Jerome Lee forces himself upon Renay, raping and impregnating her with a child, Denise, that results in their marriage and incompletion of college. Following the birth of Denise, Jerome Lee begins to drink heavily and takes odd jobs, predominantly as a traveling hair supplies salesman, which he implements as a tool and guise for rampant marital infidelity. Just before Renay decides to leave him, Jerome Lee sells her childhood piano for liquor money, indicating Renay's last straw and a physical altercation between them that leads to Jerome Lee striking her. Renay is slowly introduced to Terry's life as a rich white lesbian, meeting her friends and social circles, and accompanying her to her frequented restaurants and parties. The two women begin to live as domestic partners, and Renay experiences nothing short of a sexual awakening while exploring her new intimate relationship with Terry. Replacing what Jerome Lee sold, Terry buys Renay a beautiful and expensive new piano. Their only arguments stem from Terry wanting Renay to cease her appearances at the club, voicing concern about Jerome Lee potentially stalking her there. Although she was confused at first, Denise comes to adore Terry, who she refers to as Aunt Terry, and she flourishes away from the inattention and subtle abuse of her father. = Chapters 6-13 = As Terry had suspected, Jerome Lee begins to stalk Renay, first visiting her at the club and causing a scene. Demanding the return of his wife and daughter, Jerome Lee becomes convinced that she has found another man, and threatens both Renay and her supposed new lover. As Renay's life continues to improve, Jerome Lee begins to haunt her in her new life even further. He stalks her at Terry's apartment, which ultimately causes their move to Terry's house in the country after the building manager receives complaints about a lurking black man from \\"concerned residents\\". Although thoroughly accepted by Terry, Renay still experiences subtle yet harsh bouts of discrimination in her new life, with the discrimination of the apartment building manager being one of many. Renay faces harsh discrimination from Terry's ex-lover, Jean Gail, in the form of racial slurs and purported stereotypes, and is accused of stealing money by Terry's white housekeeper. She is often singled out for being black in Renay's predominantly white social circles, yet maintains her dignity and remains unapologetic about her blackness. Although Renay does face some discrimination, the majority of Terry's friends and acquaintances seem to accept her, at least superficially. Phil Millard and Benjie, a fun gay couple, frequent Terry's house and extend their friendship to Renay without question. Renay and Terry often attend parties and outings with Terry's friend Vance Kenton and her much younger girlfriend Lorraine. After some push from Terry, Renay begins attending college once again, following their move into Terry's house on the outskirts of town in a secluded neighborhood called Willow Wood. The new couple and Denise settle into the new home, with Terry and Renay slowly assuming the stereotypical roles of husband and wife, respectively, and a nuclear family. Renay plays piano much more for purely pleasure and composes a piece that Terry surprises her with publishing it. After Denise finishes school for the year, Renay decides to send her away for the summer to stay with her grandmother, Renay's mother, in fictional Tilltown, Kentucky. = Chapters 14-21 = During one summer night, an inebriated Jerome Lee follows Terry and Renay back from the club after one of Renay's performances and drives them off the road, but the women manage to drive away without much confrontation. Shortly after, Terry is approached with an offer to travel to New York City to interview an up-and-coming Hollywood starlet, but is concerned with leaving Renay alone after their run-in with Jerome Lee. After Renay insists she can handle her ex-husband, Terry begrudgingly accepts the offer and leaves for two weeks. While Terry is away, Vance's girlfriend Lorraine pays Renay a visit and accompanies her to the club. Afterwards, the women return to Terry's house and a drunk Lorraine attempts to seduce Renay, but is met with rejection and leaves. Renay then finds Jerome Lee in the kitchen, who learns of Renay's sexuality after seeing Lorraine kiss her and overhearing their conversation about Terry. After demanding to know where Denise is, Jerome Lee beats her nearly to death and leaves her bleeding and unconscious on the floor. Edith Stilling, a friendly neighbor and widow, finds Renay alive but severely beaten, but with no severe injuries. Terry returns home early and Renay beings the healing process. She learns that Jerome Lee has skipped town and that a music publishing company wants to publish her piece \\"Song for Souls\\". Once recovered, Renay briefly visits her childhood home in Kentucky to see both Denise and her mother. After she returns, Terry and Renay resume their lives together while Denise remains in Kentucky, and Renay is granted full custody and a divorce from Jerome Lee in a court hearing he fails to attend. Renay continues her studies and Terry works on her novel \\"A Forest in the Heart\\", which Mrs. Stilling affirms is based on the relationship of Terry and Renay. Renay receives a call from Kentucky and learns that Denise has been killed in a car accident after Jerome Lee was visiting and took her for a drive while drunk. After attending Denise's funeral, Renay retracts into herself and becomes withdrawn from Terry and the outside world, wondering if her daughter's death is a punishment from God for her homosexual relationship with Terry. Shortly after, Renay leaves Terry, explaining with a note that she does not want to ruin their relationship with her unhappiness and asks her not to contact her again. Months later, on Christmas Eve, Terry attends Vance's Christmas party and rejects the advances of an attractive woman. Upon returning home, Terry finds Renay asleep on the couch. The two women profess their love for one another and the novel concludes with their passionate reconciliation.  Characters  = Main characters = * Renay Davis: The protagonist of the novel. A young, attractive black female pianist, wife to Jerome Lee Davis, and mother to their young daughter Denise Davis. Her affinity for piano began in her childhood, where she was the protege of piano instructor Miss Pearl Sims. It is for Miss Simms that she has her first inkling of lesbianism, as she develops what was most likely a crush on the much older woman, who is a most likely a lesbian. Neither in high school or college does she have any sexual relationships, and is only pressured into dating Jerome Lee when she is accused of being a lesbian due to her complete lack of male suitors. * Terrence \\"Terry\\" Bluvard: Renay's white lesbian lover. A successful writer, Terry is wealthy from her own success, but was also born into a rich family. A regular at the Peacock Supper Club, Terry requests Renay play her a song and seems to fall for her immediately. * Jerome Lee Davis: The estranged husband of Renay and father of Denise. A raging alcoholic, Jerome Lee works as a traveling hair supplies salesman, and spends all of his money on gambling and alcohol. In college, where he and Renay met, he was popular and a star football player. He began pursuing Renay because of her looks, but continued because her persistence in rejecting him. On one of the first dates, he rapes Renay and impregnates her, thus ending his college football career when he drops out of college and marries Renay, which he perpetually holds against her. * Denise Davis: Young, elementary school-aged daughter of Renay and Jerome Lee. She is characterized as bright and energetic, and takes well to living with 'Aunt Terry' after her mother leaves her father. After being sent away for the summer, Denise is killed in a drunk driving accident at the fault of her father. * Fran Brown: An old friend of Renay's from her hometown. She works as a school teacher and often watches Denise, who calls her Aunt Fran. Fran does not understand Renay's relationship with Terry, as Renay keeps it a secret. * Vance Kenton: Restaurant owner and good friend of Terry, and is also a lesbian. Vance works intermittently as an artist and often hosts extravagant parties, frequented by other members of the gay community. * Miss Pearl Sims: Referred to as simply Miss Sims or Sims, Renay's childhood piano instructor. She taught music at the high-school level and gave private music lessons to young hopeful black musicians. She lived in a fairly large house without a husband, and was often referred to as an \\"old maid\\", \\"spinster\\", and \\"too much ed-u-cashon to git a man\\". Miss Sims took a particular liking to Renay and paid particular attention to her training. Although Renay did not know as a child, Miss Sims is a lesbian, which is revealed both through her disapproval of men and her live-in female lover at the end of the novel. It is for Miss Sims that Renay has her first lesbian feelings for, as she wonders if she is in love with Miss Sims during her childhood. = Secondary characters = * Jean Gail: One of Terry's former lovers, a young, rather brittle and attractive blonde woman who occasionally works as a model. Terry and her met at a magazine office and the two had an affair, an affair which ended as soon as Terry met Renay. Often makes fairly racist remarks and is hostile towards Renay, both because of her relationship with Terry and her race. * Phil Millard: A professional photographer and Terry's best male friend, the two often work together. A gay man, Phil lives with a much younger man, Benjie. He is consistently very friendly and open-minded when confronted with Renay and Terry's interracial relationship. * Edith Stilling: Terry's widowed neighbor, an older woman with an appreciation for literature and music. She owns a dog named Walden, his namesake being the novel Walden by Henry David Thoreau. Characterized as friendly and helps Renay after she is beaten by Jerome Lee. * Lorraine: A young, volatile woman and Vance's live-in lover. Attempts to seduce Renay and eventually leaves Vance towards the end of the novel. * Miss Wilby: An older stout white woman, former maid of Terry Bluvard. Terry fires her after she accuses Renay of stealing her money. * Benjie: The 21-year-old live-in lover of Phil Millard. Characterized as relatively immature. * Ruzicka: The owner of the Peacock Supper Club and Renay's boss. * Mr. Herald: Manager of Terry's apartment building. * Clarence Wigginstone II: A black man Renay briefly meets at Benjie's birthday celebration. Like Renay, he is also gay and black and has a white lover. He states that he gets lonely of being the only black person in his social circle and that he is happy to see another.  Literary significance  The release of Loving Her was groundbreaking in itself, as it is seminal work of black lesbian literature and essentially established the foreground for the genre. As proclaimed by author Alycee Lane, author of the forward for Loving Her in its 1997 publication, not only was the novel pioneer in its overarching black lesbian theme, but it was simultaneously the \\"first to feature a black lesbian as its protagonist.\\" American author and critic Jewelle Gomez wrote in Home Girls that Shockley's novel is \\"a groundbreaking effort whose mere accomplishment deserves applause\\". Renowned American novelist Alice Walker applauds Ann Allen Shockley and Loving Her for shining the inceptionary light on interracial lesbianism in a Ms. magazine article in 1975, and stated in a 1998 edition of American Quarterly that Loving Her explores a \\"daring subject boldy shared\\" and the novel is of \\"immense value\\" and it \\"allows us glimpses at physical intimacies between women that have been, in the past, deliberately ridiculed or obscured.\\" According to literary critic and women's studies scholar Bonnie Zimmerman, the 1974 publication of Loving Her was all the more consequential due to its predating of a 1979 issue of Conditions, an editing collaboration between Barbara Smith and Lorraine Bethel, which made Black lesbian writing \\"widely public\\" and put the genre on the literary map. Moreover, the novel contributes to significant debates concerning black women during the 1960s and 1970s, including its confrontation of \\"racism, patriarchy and hetereosexist institutions that threaten black women's agency\\". With her work Loving Her, Ann Allen Shockley ultimately delves into the intersectionality of \\"ethnicity, sexuality, gender, and class\\".  Critical reception  Upon its publication in 1974, Loving Her was not recognized as a pioneer text in an emergent genre, and would not be recognized as such for years to come. The initial reception of the novel was mediocre at best, receiving little critical reception and no significant recognition in popular culture or the literary world. Moreover, the majority of critical reviews of Loving Her, with few exceptions, \\"pre-date 1980 and are brief, antiquated, relatively inaccessible, and/or hardly scholarly or meritorious.\\" Even during a time period in which African American women writers were becoming all the more prolific and their works widely recognized, Loving Her was all but overlooked and disregarded by the literary world. This lack of critical reception is perhaps due to a surfeit of shortcomings, including, but not limited to, \\"poor publicity and inimical reviews, editorial and regional biases, racism, sexism, and homophobia.\\" Over the years, the novel has received some, yet not extensive, criticism from both the literary and gay communities. However, excluding a few feminist reviews by authors like Alice Walker and Jewelle Gomez, Loving Her received little critical recognition from the black community, which Shockley herself associates with \\"rampant homophobia\\" omnipresent throughout the black community. In its seldom mention by the black press, the novel was often discounted for its divergence from the black nationalism ideology. In Black World, critic Frank Lamont Phillips states that Loving Her is not \\"black enough\\" to be published in Black World, and even further says that \\"this bullshit should not be tolerated\\", when referring to Loving Her as a work of black literature. Both Shockley and her novel have also been bitingly criticized for bringing up poignant questions of race, class, and sexuality, yet falling short in any attempt to answer them. Significant problems of race and racism are presented in Renay's introduction into Terry's white world, yet these problems \\"all appear to resolve themselves\\". Renay is repeatedly discriminated against for her blackness: she is essentially used as entertainment when continuously asked to play piano for Terry's white friends, assumed to be Terry's maid singularly due to her race on multiple occasions, and sexually and verbally assaulted. Shockley not once addresses the notion that \\"the world which Renay has entered does not have a place for her as an African American.\\" Instead, she focuses on the love that seems to transcend these racial tensions, yet still \\"fails to explore how race impacts Terry and Renay as a couple.\\" = Criticism of black nationalism = Although superficially a novel focused on an interracial lesbian relationship, Loving Her contributes significantly to the growing critique of black nationalism, most significantly by black women, during the time of its publication. Now commonly antiquated as a myth, this rhetoric \\"assumes that black women, in collusion with the white power structure, emasculated black men, thereby preventing them from maintaining their \\"rightful\\" position in the black family and society at large.\\" Ann Allen Shockley models the character of Jerome Lee as a human embodiment of this black nationalist discourse, as he emulates this ideal with the blaming of his failures on Renay throughout the novel. In the forward, Alycee Lane argues that the destruction of Renay and Jerome Lee's archetypical relationship, coupled with a more authentic love between Renay and Terry, \\"critiques nationalist rhetoric on the black family\\". Moreover, in Black Women Novelists and the National Aesthetic, author Madhu Dubey asserts that Loving Her strays from similar novels of around the same time, such as Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye or Gayl Jones's Corregidora, in that it does not \\"conclude with a strained adjustment to the heterosexual parameters of black nationalism.\\" Through a black feminist lens presented in a literary review in Obsidian III, the character of Jerome Lee bolsters the idea that \\"black men, in order to assert their masculinity and sense of self, denigrate Black women\\", presumably a resulting burden of black nationalism on black women. = Adherence to heteronormative gender roles = A significant criticism of Loving Her surrounds Ann Allen Shockley's maintaining of archetypal heterosexual relationship roles within the homosexual relationship of Renay and Terry. As described by Le-Ann Elgie in her critical review in MELUS, \\"Renay runs from the patriarchal and heterosexist world of Jerome Lee, she finds a world in which very similar principles of control are perpetuated.\\" Terry assumes the stereotypical role of the man, paying the bills, generating the income, and relying on Renay for the majority of domestic duties and household chores, which are roles nearly identical to those once assumed by Renay and her ex-husband and the postwar 1950s family. In an additional critical review in Lesbian Tide by its founder Jeanne Cordova, Cordova ascertains that Loving Her falls short in that its story of two women in a relationship falls victim to traditional heterosexist models, and also further criticizes the work for its stereotypical contribution to the lesbian genre, saying \\"every bad lesbian novel begins at night in bed\\", which refers to the beginning of Loving Her. Le-Ann Elgie perpetuates this idea, saying that the life that Terry brings Renay into is not so unlike the \\"oppressive, patriarchal and hetereosexist world that Renay had left behind.\\"  Further reading  * *  References  Category:1974 novels Category:LGBT literature in the United States ","title":"Loving Her"},{"id":"62280244","text":"Akram Habib is a Coptic Egyptian-British biblical scholar, pracademic, social activist and human rights advocate., p. 52-55, p. 129, p. 253, p.7 He is best known for his biblical exegesis Arabic TV programme Words of Prophecy on Alhorreya channel which is concerned with literal, allegorical and mystical hermeneutics of biblical prophecies specifically related to the Christian eschatological doctrine of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ in an academic method, usually by referring to the original texts of the Old Testament and the New Testament of the Bible in various manuscripts and Bible concordances such as Strong's Concordance in comparison with modern Arabic and English Bible translations and to the commentaries of the early Church fathers before the 4th century AD.

The company filters the CO2 directly from the ambient air through an adsorption-desorption process. Projects In May 2017 the company opened the world's first commercial CO2 project filtering from the ambient air in Hinwil. There are 18 with Direct air capture modules 900 tons CO2 each year and then sold to a greenhouse operator for use as fertilizer. In October 2017, a demo project followed, in which a module on CO2 filter is used at the Hellishei√∞i Power Station in Iceland. As part of the Horizon 2020 research project CarbFix2 will become the CO2 filtered from the air and then stored underground as a stone. Climeworks refers to the filtering of CO2 from the ambient air for underground storage also as Carbon dioxide removal.  History  In November 2009 Climeworks AG was founded by Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher as a Spin-off from ETH Zurich. The two German founders were fellow students in mechanical engineering and had in the context of their studies and the subsequent doctorate with technologies for chemical and physical CO2. In 2011, Climeworks received capital from investors for the first time to develop a prototype with a modular structure. Since 2011 then, the rapid scaling has followed today's module technology, which has been available since 2014. In the course of the enterprise development a partnership with the automaker Audi succeeded. Further support was provided by Climeworks from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy which enabled the accelerated commercialization and scaling of the technology. Climeworks is part of several European research and development projects. Among others, the production of synthetic fuels on the basis CO2. Since 2018 a Swiss mineral water bottler in Vals, took a CO2 plant in operation to make drinks with carbon dioxide from the air. The company's goal by 2025 is to achieve one percent of its annual global CO2 emissions filtered from the air. This requires the construction of 250,000 systems, comparable to the one in Hinwil. A German subsidiary Climeworks Deutschland GmbH opened in Cologne.https://www.climeworks.com/climeworks-deutschland-gmbh- has-opened-its-offices-in-cologne/  Commercialization  Climeworks has the only existing commercial direct air capture machine. Although several companies aim to commercialize direct air capture systems (e.g., Carbon Engineering, Global Thermostat, Climeworks), Climeworks is the furthest along in the market process, selling to a comparatively small market in high-cost CO2 (i.e., CO2 used in greenhouses to enhance productivity may cost more than $1,000/t if the greenhouse is located far from a source). This market is too small to support a robust ecosystem of small innovators necessary to explore the large number of chemical recipes and physical machinery that might decrease direct air capture prices. Thus, like photovoltaics or hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, the development of direct air capture will likely require long-term government investment in incentives.

She previously served as Chair of the National Women's Political Caucus, Chair of the National Commission on Working Women, Executive Director of the Philippine American Foundation, Founder and President of Asian American Professional Women, and Founding Director of the National Network of Asian-Pacific American Women.  Life  Irene Natividad was born in Manila, Philippines, the eldest of four children of a chemical engineer. The family followed their father to several countries where he worked, including Japan, Iran, Greece and India. In 1971, she graduated valedictorian in the undergraduate class of Long Island University. In 1973, she obtained a Master‚Äòs degree in American literature and, in 1976, a Master‚Äòs degree in Philosophy from Columbia University in New York. From 1974-1976 Natividad taught early American literature first at Lehman College of City University of New York and then at Columbia University. At the age of 26 (1974), she married Mr. Andrea Cortese, a Satellite Communications executive. Together, they have one son.  Political activities  Her political career began with the distribution of leaflets for the presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy in 1968. From 1982 to 1984, she was the Chairman of the New York State Asian Pacific Caucus, then Vice-Chair of the newly-formed Asian Pacific Caucus of the Democratic National Committee. In 1984, she supported the election campaign of Geraldine Ferraro, the first female vice presidential candidate nominated on the Democratic party ticket, and served as the campaign's liaison to Asian-American voters. She was elected as the Chair of the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) in 1985, making her the first Asian-American woman to lead a national political organization in the United States. In 1987, she was re-elected as Chairman. Under her leadership, the caucus gathered hard data to analyze factors influencing women's congressional races and compiled an annual Survey of Governors' Appointments of Women to state cabinets. The caucus also established the first-ever Minority Women Candidates' Training Program and created the Good Guy Award honoring men who further the cause of women's rights. During the nineties, she assumed the chairmanship of the National Commission on Working Women, which works on economic equity issues affecting women through groundbreaking research and training programs, and held the role for nine years. To promote women candidates for high government-appointed positions, Natividad served as Chair of the Coalition for Women's Appointments for three Presidential administrations - for George H.W. Bush in 1998, Bill Clinton in 1992, and Barack Obama in 2008. She also served as National Chair for Asian Americans and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Women for Hillary during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2008 and 2016. Natividad has also been influential in several campaigns to increase the number of women voters in Presidential Elections in the U.S. As Chair of the Women‚Äôs Vote Project in 1996, she led a non-profit coalition of 110 women‚Äôs groups, and, in 2000, as Chair of Women Vote 2000, she focused the Coalition‚Äôs efforts on encouraging more women of color to vote.  Global Summit of Women  To promote women's economic opportunities and advancement, Natividad has convened the Global Summit of Women, star-studded forums for women in business and government globally. The first Global Summit of Women took place in 1990 in Canada, with the second taking place in 1992 in Dublin, Ireland, followed by Taipei in 1994. Since the 1997 Summit in Miami, Florida, the Global Summit of Women has taken place annually. Informally called the Davos for Women by participants, the Summit focuses on sharing best practices and working strategies that advance women‚Äôs economic status globally. In recent years, over 1,000 women from over 60 countries consistently attend each Summit, with participants ranging from Heads of State and women government ministers of various portfolios to male and female senior executives of multinational corporations to women entrepreneurs of small and mid-sized businesses. Over the three-decade history of the Global Summit of Women, participants have included South African President Nelson Mandela, numerous sitting Presidents including Mary Robinson of Ireland, Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Tarja Halonen of Finland, Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe, Prime of France Manuel Valls, and corporate leaders including PepsiCo Chair and CEO Indra Nooyi and Chair of MCM Holdings AG Sung Joo Kim. An off-shoot of the Global Summit of Women is the internationally-renowned Corporate Women Directors International (CWDI), which conducts research on women on the boards of directors of top companies globally. CWDI is frequently cited in the global media on the topic of women on boards. As Chairperson of CWDI, Natividad has authored 29 reports since 1997, including six editions of the CWDI Report on Women Board Directors of the Fortune Global 200 between the years of 2004 and 2019. She has also advocated for countries to take proactive measures to accelerate gender diversity on corporate boards. Among the venues in which she has spoken on the issue include: * G7 Meeting of the Minister of Labour in Paris in 2019 * W20 (Women 20) Summit in Argentina in 2018; * UN High-Level Panel on Women in Leadership Positions at the UN meetings in 2016-18; * APEC Women and the Economy Summit (2015); * Global Economic Symposium (2010-2015); * OECD Southeast Asia Forum in Indonesia in 2014; * European Federation for New Ideas (2011-2014); * OECD New World Forum (2015); and * Club de Madrid (2012), among many others. In addition, Natividad was invited by the European Commission to address the Committee on Women Rights and Gender Equality in 2010, as it deliberated on a measure to mandate a quota for women board directors across the EU. Since 2006, she has pioneered Market Opens which have gathered women in business and politics to spotlight the achievements of women in the economy through participation in over 20 ring-the-bell ceremonies at Stock Exchanges around the world. The Market Opens have taken place at NASDAQ (2006) in New York, the Toronto Stock Exchange (2008), Johannesburg Stock Exchange (2009), Madrid (2011), Istanbul (2011), Barcelona (2012), Warsaw (2012 and 2016), Sao Paolo (2012), Hong Kong (2012), Zurich (2013), Kuala Lumpur (2013), the Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt (2013), the Euronext Paris Exchange (2014), ASX in Sydney (2014), Manila (2015), Mexico City (2016 and 2018), Ho Chi Minh City (2017), Bangkok (2017), and Bogota, Colombia (2018).  Board directorships and appointments  Natividad has served on several international advisory boards for governments and policy organizations. In 2019, she was appointed by French President Emmanuel Macron to the G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council, which was tasked with providing recommendations to President Macron to advance women's equality during the year of France's Presidency of the G7. She has also served on Advisory Boards for G20 Engagement Groups, including the T20 (Think Tanks) and W20 (Women), as a member of UN Women's Leadership for Gender Equality Forum, has been a Board Member for the Global Economic Symposium based in Germany, and the European Commission‚Äôs Network to Promote Women in Decision-Making.. In the corporate arena, Natividad has served on numerous corporate and advisory boards. In 1994, she was appointed to the Board of Directors of Sallie Mae Corporation, a Fortune 100 company, by President Clinton. Other board positions include advisory boards for L'Oreal France, Cigna Corporation, Wyndham International, Enterprising Women Magazine, National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD), the National Museum for Women in the Arts and the International Museum of Women.

It is an imperative programming language, like many languages of the 1960s, but was deliberately verbose, attempting to look more like conversational English in the fashion of HyperText and later languages. Unlike other educational languages of the era, SNAP was not intended to be interactive and was designed to be programmed via punch cards. To save cards, multiple period-separated statements could be written on every card, so the resulting code often looked like a single paragraph. History In 1964, Michael Barnett joined RCA's newly-formed Graphic Systems Division which had been formed to commercialize the photo-typesetting technology they had licensed from Rudolf Hell. Originally known as Digiset, RCA sold the systems under the name Videocomp. About 50 Videocomp systems were sold over its history. In 1964 and 1965, Barnett developed a page description language known as PAGE-1 to write programs that resulted in Videocomp output, similar to the way the later PostScript language produces pages on laser printers. One of the early applications of this system was to publish Social Sciences Index by the H. W. Wilson Company. This led to Barnett's interest in the social sciences and his increasing interactions with H. W. Wilson and Columbia University's humanities department. Barnett took a position at H. W. Wilson in 1969. He had also started to teach courses on library automation at the Columbia School of Library Service, and in 1970, computer programming in the humanities. He joined the Columbia faculty full-time in 1975. The first version of SNAP was written by William Ruhsam of RCA in FORTRAN IV for the RCA Spectra 70, although a version for the IBM 360 in OS-360 was also produced. some time in 1967 or 1968. The language generated a fair amount of comment, especially in the early 1970s, but appears to have had little direct influence on later languages. Description =General concepts= SNAP allowed multiple statements to be placed on a single line, and used the period as the statement separator. This produced code that looked like English sentences, and was generally organized into blocks that looked like paragraphs. SNAP did not use line numbers for editing, and instead used in-code labels for branch targets, as was the case in FORTRAN. In SNAP, a label could be placed anywhere in the code by surrounding the textual name in parenthesis like . Labels were not separate statements, and did not require a period after them. Variables names could contain spaces, which is relatively rare for programming languages even today. Variables could hold strings or numbers, but different syntax was used to assign each one. For numbers, a simple syntax was used, was also used to perform mathematical operations, like A simpler syntax was offered for the more common increment and decrement operations, or For strings, a longer syntax was typically used, Substrings were accessed using a HyperTalk-like syntax by referring to the ordinal position, for instance, , or SNAP also offered array-like collections known as \\"lists\\". Internally, these were stored as comma-delimited strings. Most of the string-related commands could be used to work with these by adding to the end. For instance, one could read a series of cards using , which would read each card as a separate string into the CARD variable. Items within a list were accessed using the same ordinal syntax, for instance , or Lists of numbers could be created using String variables can also be used as lists, or arrays. This was accomplished using the same ordinal position syntax but referring to the variable name and not the . For instance, would create an array called PART with two strings in it. An important point of the SNAP system is that the statement is not static; it does not define KEY as the character at location J when it is encountered in the code, but when any following code accesses KEY. For instance, would result in two different strings being printed. In this fashion, has more in common with the BASIC programming language's user-defined functions than it does with the statement, which is static. A static copy of a string could be made by Other string functions included \`APPEND one string TO another string.\`, \`OVERWRITE string- expression ON THE M-TH [AND SUBSEQUENT] CHARACTER[S] OF string-name.\`, \`DELETE THE M-TH [THROUGH N-TH] CHARACTER[S] OF string-name.\` and \`INSERT string- expression (BEFOREAFTER) THE M-TH CHARACTER OF string-name.\` Unconditional branches were called using , for instance, There was also the alternative form . There was no difference between them, although the context of the surrounding code generally meant one form or the other was more natural to read. One could also refer to the start of the program with \\"As follows\\" could be used to refer to the next statement, , which could be used to clarify branches. Conditional branches used an if‚Äìthen(‚Äìelse) structure: IF J IS LESS THAN 80 INCREASE J BY 1, AND REPEAT FROM THE FIRST LABEL, OTHERWISE CONTINUE AS FOLLOWS. As in most languages, the section was optional. Note the use of to make a compound statement within the then section, offering a block structure. For string comparisons, one used or the optional . SNAP included a number of other keywords that had no behaviour of their own that were added simply for syntactic sugar. Among them were , , which the programmer could add in many locations to make the syntax more readable. Typical uses included and . =Statements= From A Natural Language.

SET I TO 1. SET J TO 1. CALL THE J-TH CHARACTER OF THE RECORD THE KEY. (LOOP START) IF THE KEY IS \\" \\" CONTINUE WITH THE BACKUP. IF THE KEY IS \\"\\" CONTINUE WITH THE BACKUP.

(OUTPUT ACTION) PRINT THE I-TH THROUGH J-TH CHARACTERS OF THE RECORD. IF J IS LESS THAN 79 INCREASE J BY 2, SET I TO J, AND REPEAT FROM THE LOOP START, OTHERWISE REPEAT FROM THE BEGINNING. EXECUTE For clarity, the following version simply spaces out the statements onto separate lines and adds appropriate whitespace: READ A RECORD. SET I TO 1. SET J TO 1. CALL THE J-TH CHARACTER OF THE RECORD THE KEY. (LOOP START) IF THE KEY IS \\" \\" CONTINUE WITH THE BACKUP. IF THE KEY IS \\"\\" CONTINUE WITH THE BACKUP. IF THE KEY IS \\".\\" CONTINUE WITH THE BACKUP. IF J IS LESS THAN 80 INCREASE J BY 1, AND REPEAT FROM THE LOOP START, OTHERWISE CONTINUE WITH THE OUTPUT ACTION. (BACKUP) DECREASE J BY 1. (OUTPUT ACTION) PRINT THE I-TH THROUGH J-TH CHARACTERS OF THE RECORD. IF J IS LESS THAN 79 INCREASE J BY 2, SET I TO J, AND REPEAT FROM THE LOOP START, OTHERWISE REPEAT FROM THE BEGINNING. EXECUTE The program s a single card and assigns the string data found on it to the variable named RECORD. It then sets up two pointers, I and J. A function called KEY is ed that returns the Jth character of RECORD. It then examines the Jth character to see if it is a word-breaking character or off the end of the string. If any of these are true, it jumps to BACKUP, which backs up one character (to skip the punctuation it just examined) and then prints out the string from the starting position in I to the current position in J. I we have not seen a word-break, try the next character if there are any left, otherwise display what we found already. If we have not reached the end of the card, move J forward by two characters to skip over the punctuation we previously avoided which will move the pointer to the start of the next (potential) word. Then set I to J to position our next word's starting position from this point, and return to LOOP START. If we are at the end of the card, start the entire program over and read another card.

Gooch Dillard Residency Halls at UVA  Name  Gooch Dillard is named after Robert Kent Gooch and Hardy Cross Dillard. Gooch was a quarterback for the Cavaliers who fought at the Somme in the First World War and returned to lecture Political Science at UVA. Dillard was a Dean of the UVA School of Law who later served as a judge on the International Court of Justice.  History  Gooch Dillard halls were built on the Piedmont plantation owned by Reuben Maury. In the 19th century, Maury owned between 20-60 slaves at a time and it is believed he buried his slaves on his lands. In the 1947 UVA acquired the land. Then in the 60s and 70s the attendance of UVA more than doubled which caused a \\"severe shortage\\" of housing. In response to this, UVA surveyed the land in 1982 to build new residency halls. In this survey they found 9 graves but did not ascertain that this was all. They marked the extent of the cemetery with 6 free standing walls and placed a plaque on one of them entitled Graveyard Site. The residency halls were designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and were built in 1984.  Structure  Gooch lies to the east and Dillard to the west. The halls together have 112 suites, 56 in each.

It was founded in 1923 by Abraham Goldstein. It is the certification agency of about 70% of kosher food worldwide, and is the largest of the ‚ÄúBig Five‚Äù major certification agencies, which include OK, Kof-K, Star-K, and CRC.  Background  OU Kosher was founded in 1923 by East Prussian chemist Abraham Goldstein as the first independent kosher certification agency. Goldstein established the kosher certification program under the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations. The certification‚Äôs symbol, the letter ‚ÄúU‚Äù inside of the letter ‚ÄúO,‚Äù was first placed on Heinz‚Äôs vegetarian baked beans, confirming that their food was certified kosher. In 1950, Rabbi Alexander S. Rosenberg joined the OU Kosher Division as rabbinic administrator. In his 22 years with the division, Rosenberg helped increase the number of employed mashgichim, or kosher supervisors, within the OU Kosher Division from 184 to 750, which helped certify over 2,500 products for 475 companies. During his time leading the division, Rosenberg set reforms in place to decrease the amount of corruption and fraud in the kosher certification industry. He ensured that local rabbis working for the OU were conforming to the uniform standards set by the division, and prevented bribery between food companies and mashgichim. In 2012, the OU released the OU Kosher app, which gave consumers easily accessible updates on certified OU Kosher products, including which products are kosher, lists of newly certified products, and updated on products that are no longer certified. As of October 2019, the OU Kosher Division is overseen by Rabbi Menachem Genack, who was appointed as rabbinic administrator in 1980. The organization now certifies close to 1,000,000 products in over 12,000 plants in 104 countries. With 886 mashgichim employed as well as over 50 rabbinic coordinators serving as account executives, the OU Kosher Division is now the world‚Äôs largest kosher certification agency.(The World of OU Kosher: A discussion with Rabbi Moshe Elefant, COO, OU Kosher\\". Orthodox Union. April 2017.) = Women's contribution = In the early 1920s, the Orthodox Union Women's Branch was established, founded and led by Rebecca ‚ÄúBetty‚Äù Goldstein. The members of the Women‚Äôs Branch produced pamphlets for Jewish women to follow kashrut in the home, as well as a series of kosher cookbooks. Since the Orthodox Union was urging women to keep their homes kosher, members from the Women‚Äôs Branch wanted to ensure that the food products that were available also followed kosher requirements. The Women‚Äôs Branch personally inspected food-manufacturing plants and insisted that rabbinical leaders within the OU expand its kashrut supervision efforts.  OU symbols  Orthodox Union Kosher uses symbols to identify how a product is certified. * OU: Product is Kosher Pareve which is neither meat or dairy. * OU-D: Product is Kosher dairy. (but not necessarily kosher for Passover). These products contain a dairy ingredient or a dairy derivative. It also means they could be made on dairy equipment. Dairy products may or may not be Chalav Yisrael. * OU-DE: Product was made on dairy equipment. * OU-Meat or OU-Glatt: Product is Kosher meat, has meat ingredients or is a derivative of meat. Alternatively, OU-Meat signifies that the product--while not containing meat ingredients itself--was made on equipment also used for making meat products. * OU-Fish: Product is kosher with fish ingredients. * OU-P: Product is Kosher for Passover. Passover products don‚Äôt contain leavened grain or kitniyot ingredients, and can be used year-around. The symbol may also signify products made on equipment that has not been Kosher for Passover.

Early Life Byrne was one of the two sons of Colclough Byrne of Drumquin, Hackettstown and Mary Galway of Cork, a great grand-niece of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond. William though was to live most of his adult life at Park Hill in the Glen of the Downs. In late 1796, he enlisted in the yeomenry - serving in the Newtown Mount Kennedy cavalry. Revolutionary Byrne joined the Society of the United Irishmen in spring 1797 and later that same year was appointed by the Leinster committee to organise the half barony of Rathdown. As a delegate for Rathdown barony, Byrne was a well respected and competent figure. And with the assistance of his protestant friend Thomas Miller of Powerscourt, he undertook the organisation of military and civil branches of the United Irishmen in Rathdown - recruiting 2,000 men by late 1797. In October of that year Byrne was forced to resign from the yeomen after refusing to swear the oath of loyalty and his activities began to come to the attention of Dublin Castle. According to the informant A.B. (Thomas Murray), William had attended the inaugural meeting of the United Irishmen's Wicklow county committee in December. It was held in the Annacurra home of William's first cousin, John Loftus. At this meeting, Byrne and was as Head Delegate for the Wicklow Committee. Thomas Murray's information tells that Byrne established networks of contacts between the Leinster committee and the Cork United Irishmen along with other contacts in Munster. Sometime in 1797, Byrne married Rosanna Hoey by whom he fathered a daughter, Mary. Arrest and Imprisonment Byrne's career came to an end when he with fourteen other Leinster delegates were arrested on 12 March 1798 at the house of Oliver Bond. They had been betrayed by Thomas Reynolds, treasurer of Kildare United Irishmen and member of the provincial committee. Reynolds had been informed that plans for an insurrection were about to be finalised by the committee. Byrne was arrested in possession of incriminating documents which were described by Attorney-General Arthur Wolfe as being: ' ... very treasonable printed papers'. On July 4, Byrne with four others was brought before a commission of oyer and terminer on charges of high treason. The case mounted by the state against him was based principally on the evidence of Reynolds and also that given by his former comrade William Miller of Powerscourt. The weight of the evidence was overwhelming, rendering an effective defence impossible. Byrne's lawyer, John Philpot Curran KC, the leading defence counsel of the age, attempted to cast Reynold's character and motives in a foul light but it was futile. Execution Byrne was convicted of high treason and executed on July 25, 1798 outside Green Street Court House, Dublin. In his last days, efforts were made to spare Byrne's life if he would only express regret for his actions and accuse Lord Edward Fitzgerald for having led him to this point. He refused, meeting his end with great dignity and stoicism. The Dublin Magazine noted that William: ' ... met his fate with a degree of courage perhaps unequalled'. For his service to the state, Reynolds was honoured by Dublin Corporation with the freedom of the city on October 19, 1798, spending much of his life thereafter in fear of assassination.

It is the sole member of the genus Danuvius. The area at this time was probably a woodland with a seasonal climate. A male specimen was estimated to have weighed about , and two females . Both genus and species were described in November 2019. It is the first-discovered Late Miocene great ape with preserved long bones which could possibly be used to reconstruct the limb anatomy and thus the locomotion of contemporary apes. It had adaptations for both hanging in trees (suspensory behavior) and walking on two legs (bipedalism)‚Äîwhereas, among present-day great apes, humans are better adapted for the latter and the others the former. Danuvius thus had a method of locomotion unlike any previously known ape called \\"extended limb clambering\\", walking directly along tree branches as well as using arms for suspending itself. The last common ancestor between humans and other apes possibly had a similar method of locomotion. Taxonomy Hammerschmiede clay pit near Pforzen, where the fossils were found The genus name Danuvius is a reference to the Celtic‚ÄìRoman river-god Danuvius, a Roman name for the river Danube, which flows through the region where the remains were found. The specific name guggenmosi honours the amateur archaeologist Sigulf Guggenmos (1941‚Äì2018), who discovered the clay pit in which Danuvius was found. The remains of Danuvius were discovered in clay near the town of Pforzen in southern Germany, magnetostratigraphically dated to 11.62 million years ago (mya) at the Serravallian-Tortonian boundary (the Astaracian‚ÄìVallesian boundary in ELMA), and were unearthed between 2015 and 2018. The holotype GPIT/MA/10000 comprises a partial skeleton with elements of the mouth, vertebrae, and long bones. There are also three paratypes: an adult left femur (GPIT/MA/10001); an adult left femur, big toe, and teeth (GPIT/MA/10003); and juvenile teeth and a middle finger bone (GPIT/MA/10002). There are 37 specimens in total. Its tooth anatomy is most similar to that of other dryopithecine great apes. Having both adaptations for hanging in trees (suspensory locomotion) and standing on two legs (bipedalism), Danuvius may have been very similar in locomotory methods to the last common ancestor between humans and other apes, which adds weight to the hypothesis that ape suspensory activity and human bipedalism both originated from a form capable of both. However, it is too early to draw more definitive conclusions because it is unclear how Danuvius is related to modern great apes, including humans. Its discovery could possibly also influence reconstructions of contemporary great ape limb anatomy and locomotion, which were previously by-and-large unknown. Description Danuvius was small and probably weighed on average . The holotype specimen, an adult male, was calculated, based on the sizes of the hip and knee joints, to have weighed with a point estimate of . The adult female specimen GPIT/MA/10003 was calculated to be with a point estimate of , and the adult female GPIT/MA/10001 with a point estimate of . This is bigger than siamangs but much smaller than contemporary great apes; for example, male bonobos weigh and females . Danuvius limb proportions are most similar to those of bonobos The sex of the individuals was determined by the size of the canines, with males presumed to have had larger canines than females. Male dryopithecines are thought to have had an elongated face with the molars pushed more towards the front of the mouth. Like those of other dryopithecines, the molars of Danuvius were wide, and there was a broad length between the two cusps; however, the premolars had three roots instead of two, and the canines were more vertically oriented rather than somewhat sticking out. Danuvius is thought to have had a broad chest. It is the first recorded Miocene great ape to have had the diaphragm located in the lower chest cavity, as in Homo, indicating an extended lower back and a greater number of functional lumbar vertebrae. This may have caused lordosis (the normal curvature of the human spine) and moved the center of mass over the hips and legs, which implies some habitual bipedal activity. The robust finger and hypertrophied wrist and elbow bones indicate a strong grip and load bearing adaptations for the arms. The legs also show adaptations for load-bearing, especially at the hypertrophied knee joint. There was likely limited ankle loading, and the ankle would have had a hinge-like function, being most stable if positioned perpendicularly to the leg as opposed to at an angle in apes. Danuvius was likely able to achieve a strong grip with its big toes, unlike modern African great apes, which would have allowed it to grasp onto thinner trees. The limb proportions are most similar to those of bonobos. Orangutan suspensory behavior Adaptations for load bearing in both the arm and leg joints to this degree is unknown in any other primate. Plantigrade catarrhine monkeys lack the capacity for suspensory locomotion or to focus body weight over the knee joint; knuckle-walking apes lack strong big toes and thumbs, and have more robust finger bones; and both lack an extendable knee. Orangutans have a clambering motion too, but their knees lack weight-bearing ability. Paleoecology The total anatomy of the limbs suggest Danuvius was capable of a seemingly unique manner of locomotion called \\"extended limb clambering\\". Danuvius likely walked along mildly inclined tree branches with its foot directly laid onto the branch, using its strong big toes for grasping. The strong knee joint would have provided balance while walking by counteracting torques, and the strong hands would have carried out a similar function during suspension or palm-walking. Extended limb clambering emphasizes knee extension and lordosis, as well as the suspensory mechanisms seen in apes, and may be a precursor to obligate bipedalism seen in human ancestors. The site has also yielded the remains of several small creatures such as molluscs, fish, and cold blooded vertebrates. Small mammals are the dominant fauna, such as rodents, rabbits, martens, hamsters, and shrews. However, large mammals are also known, such as the extinct mouse-deer Dorcatherium, the antelope Miotragocerus, and the rhinoceros Aceratherium. The site is located in the Upper Freshwater Molasse of the Molasse basin; by the late Miocene, the Paratethys Sea had dried up and the Alps had lifted, allowing the expansion of wetland habitats in the basin. The late Miocene may have been the beginning of a drying trend characterized by increased seasonality, causing deciduous forest to turn into a less dense woodland, and fruit and leaf production to occur cyclically rather than year-round. The late Miocene cooling trend may have led to the replacement of more tropical flora by mid-latitude and alpine varieties, and ultimately the extinction of European great apes.

He has been the Old Believer archbishop of Novosibirsk since 2015. Personal life Kilin was born in the village of Podoynikovo into a religious family of Old Believers. His grandfather was originally a member of the Bezpopovtsy sect which has no clergy, but later in life joined the Belokrinitskaya sect which does have a church hierarchy and became a priest. From 1958 to 1962, Kilin served as a radio engineer in the air defense forces on Sakhalin in the ranks of the Soviet army. In 1962 he married and from 1962 to 1966 he was a subdeacon with the bishop of Chi»ôinƒÉu, . Religious life =As decon and priest= On 24 December 1966 Kilin was ordained deacon Bishop of Chisinau , and on 25 December he was ordained priest to the Intercession Church in Chisinau, where he served as rector. In 1987 he was appointed rector of the church in the city of Minusinsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai, and dean of all Siberia and the Far East. Kilin later spoke about his experience, saying: \\"When Moscow entrusted me, first, as the dean, and then as the ruling bishop of the Siberian diocese, to oversee the development of spirituality in this vast territory [...] [from the Urals] to the Pacific Ocean, it was necessary to restore the territory from scratch. Back then, there were only a few parishes, including in Novosibirsk - historical, seasoned - and also a good number in Tomsk. Everything else was actually a wasteland and was developed by the forces of local Christians, beginning in 1992.\\" In 1990 he was elevated to the rank of archpriest. On 18 October 1992, Kilin received his monastic tonsure in Novosibirsk. =As Bishop= On 18 October 1992, in the Intercession Cathedral on the Rogozhsky cemetery, he was ordained bishop with the monastic name of Siluyan. The consecration was performed by the Metropolitan of Moscow and All Russia , together with the Bishop of Kiev and All Ukraine, . Due to the rule on celibacy in the old-rite church, Siluyan's wife, Valentina, took monastic vows and took the name Barsanuphius, with the blessing of Metropolitan Alimpiy; she was appointed abbess of the St. Nicholas Uleiminsky convent of the diocese of Yaroslavl and Kostroma. At the same time, Siluyan (Kilin) was assigned to the territory of the former Irkutsk-Amur and the entire Far East diocese. After repeatedly visiting the Chita Oblast, Siluyan (Kilin) established the old believer parish of St. Nicholas in the village of Dono, and planned in the future to establish another church in the name of the Holy Hieromartyr Habakkuk in the city of Chita. In 2000, he was entrusted with pastoral care of the RORC parish of the Holy Cross Exaltation in Australia. In 2004, after the death of Metropolitan , he was one of the candidates put forward at the Holy Synod of the RORC to become the next Metropolitan of Moscow of the RORC. Ultimately the council decided that Cornelius (Titov) would be the next metropolitan. On 5 August 2005, the RORC Bishops' Court ruled that Bishop Siluyan should not be allowed to attend church liturgies due to canonical violations. The ban was lifted after Siluyan repented, and he was allowed to attend a funeral in Moscow with his fellow bishops. Speaking of the challenges of being a bishop in Siberia, Siluyan (Kilin) said that there are not enough Old-rite priest in the area to cover all the parishes all the time, as in a territory as vast as Siberia, even by train or plane it could take several days for a priest to travel from one parish to another.

History =18th and 19th centuries= Enghavevej, 1860 The name Kongens Enghave (The King's Meadow Garden) is known from 1683 and referred to an area used for production of animal feed for the king's horses. The road was created in 1795 when the area was divided into 22 estates and sold. The road continued all the way to Gammel K√∏ge Landevej. The only buildings along the road were the farms Frederiksholm, Larsens Minde, Lises Minde Frederikslund and Wilhelms Minde. In 1871, Frederiksholm was acquired by two brothers and converted into a brickworks. Frederiksholm Brickworks produced many of the bricks that were used in the construction of Vesterbro. The brickworks closed in 1918. =20th century= The tramway depot photographed by Frederik Riise Arbejdernes Kooperative Byggeselskab (The Workers' Cooperative Building Association) started redeveloping the area shortly after its foundation in 1913. In 1915, Copenhagen Tramways line 3 was extended from Enghave Plads to a tram loop at Frederiksholm (now Sydhavns Plads). On 15 October 1937, Line 3 was extended to Mozarts Plads. A large remise and workshop complex for the trams was also built at the street. The outer part of Enghavevej was in 1933 renamed Ellebjergvej, Stubm√∏llevej, Wagnersvej and Glucksvej. The section from Sydhavns Plads to Mozarts Plads was in 1949 renamed Borgbjergsvej.

It is centred at the intersections of Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street, West. The present neighbourhood was the result of the government expropriating Toronto's first Chinatown in the late 1950s to make way for a new city hall and public square. As a result of the expropriations, a number of businesses and residents based in the city's first Chinatown moved west towards Spadina Avenue during the 1950s and 1960s, later joined by other Chinese immigrants during the 1960s. The neighbourhood is one of several Chinatowns in Toronto that developed during the latter half of the 20th century. History Toronto's present day downtown Chinatown was formerly a Jewish district, although a small Chinese community was already present in this location prior to the 1950s. A lion dance in First Chinatown, 1975. Historically, residents of Toronto's First Chinatown and subsequently, West Chinatown, were immigrants from southern China and Hong Kong The creation of this Chinatown was driven by the demolition of First Chinatown at Bay Street and Dundas Street West, from the 1950-1960s to make way for Toronto City Hall. While a handful of Chinese businesses still thrive there, much of the Chinese community have largely migrated west from there to the present Chinatown neighbourhood, thus its name, \\"West Chinatown\\". Chinatown continued to expand with the influx of Chinese immigrants during the 1960s, many of the wives and descendants of the Chinese men already in Canada due to the lifting of Canada's racial exclusion act. With much of Toronto's downtown Jewish population moving north along Bathurst Street, the businesses in this area became largely Chinese. In the following decades, students and skilled workers arrived from Hong Kong, Guangdong province and Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and the Caribbean further increased the Chinese population, which led to the creation of additional Chinese communities east of Toronto. The neighbourhood has been noted as being a \\"near complete community\\" with housing, employment, and commerce, along with schools and social services all located within walking distance in the neighbourhood. Today, the economic and social centre of Toronto's downtown Chinatown primarily runs north-south along Spadina Avenue to College Street to Sullivan Street and east-west along Dundas Street West from Augusta Avenue to Beverley Street. A mansion that is converted to the Italian Consulate is at the northwest corner of Dundas and Beverley. Since the 2000s the West Chinatown has been changing from the influx of new residents, businesses from immigrants and 2nd generation Canadians. The neighbourhood has continued to serve as a vital market hub and services, to people from inside the neighbourhood and outside. The central location of the neighbourhood has also been a draw for property developers, changing the face of the neighbourhood. The El Mocambo live music venue is in the northern end of Chinatown, although this 1940s establishment was there before the neighbourhood became Chinatown. Both the 505 Dundas and 510 Spadina streetcar routes run through Chinatown. Economy The area hosts diverse set of East Asian cuisines, groceries, and shops. Toronto's downtown Chinatown is one of the largest in North America. It is centred on the intersection of Dundas Street West and Spadina Avenue, and extends outward from this point along both streets. With the population changes of recent decades, it has come to reflect a diverse set of East Asian cultures through its shops and restaurants, including Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai. The major Chinese malls in the area are Dragon City and Chinatown Centre. Since the 1990s, downtown Chinatown is redefining itself in the face of changing demographics and gentrification of the neighbourhood. As the aging population shrank, revenues of businesses in the neighbourhood also decreased. While the majority of the grocery stores and shops remain, most of the once-famed restaurants on Dundas Street West, especially the barbecue shops located below grade, have closed since 2000. Competition from commercial developments in suburban Chinese communities also drew wealth and professional immigrants away from downtown. Unlike those newer developments in the suburbs, Chinatown's economy relies heavily on tourism and Chinese seniors. As many younger, higher-income immigrants settled elsewhere in the city, those left in the district are typically from older generations who depend on downtown's dense concentration of services and accessibility to public transportation. With developers changing or resulting in the closure of well regarded businesses, the Chinatown neighbourhood is facing the pressures of gentrification along with many other Toronto ethnic neighbourhoods and communities such as Greektown, Koreatown, Little Portugal, and Little Italy. Scene on Spadina Avenue In the early 21st century, downtown neighbourhoods became more attractive to urban professionals and young people who work in the Financial District, as well as its proximity to the University of Toronto and to OCAD University, leading to the gentrification of surrounding areas and potentially changing the face of West Chinatown. A key representative of the neighbourhood and its interests is the Toronto Chinatown Business Improvement Area (Â§öÂÄ´Â§öËèØÂü†ÂïÜÊ•≠ÊîπÈÄ≤ÂçÄ), also known as the Chinatown BIA. A non-for-profit organization funded by the commercial property owners of the downtown Chinatown area, it was founded in 2007 and works closely with representatives of the federal, provincial, and city government, the police, as well as community stakeholders to promote and enhance the community as a commercial destination while maintaining its cultural character. Demographics The present day West Chinatown is located along Spadina Avenue, emerging with the influx of Chinese immigrants in the 1960s.Historically, Toronto's Downtown Chinatown has been represented by immigrants and families from southern China and Hong Kong. Since the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to the People's Republic of China in 1997, immigrants from mainland China have greatly exceeded those from Hong Kong. However, at present Cantonese remains the primary language used by businesses and restaurants in Chinatown. The Chinese immigrant population now consists of distinct subgroups. To the east of Spadina Avenue, numerous university students attending the University of Toronto, OCAD University (formerly the Ontario College of Art and Design), and Ryerson University live in many of the small houses built as workers' housing. The diversity brings a more multicultural flavour to the district, but it may gradually reduce or eliminate its identity as Chinatown. Translation of street names A number of streets in Downtown Chinatown are bilingual, a feature first introduced in the 1970s. The translations are mainly phonetic and use Chinese characters defined through Cantonese or Taishanese pronunciations. * Augusta Avenue - Êæ≥ÂêâÂ£´ÊâìÈÅì (Jyutping: ou3 gat1 si6 daa2 dou6) * Baldwin Street - ÂØ∂Èõ≤Ë°ó ( Jyutping: bou2 wan4 gaai1) * Beverley Street - ÊØîËèØÂà©Ë°ó (Jyutping: bei2 waa4 lei6 gaai1) * Bulwer Street - ÂØ∂ËèØË°ó ( Jyutping: bou2 waa4 gaai1) * Cameron Street - Âç°Ê¢ÖÈöÜË°ó (Jyutping: kaa1 mui4 ling4 gaai1) * Cecil Street - ÊñΩÁ¥†Ë°ó (Jyutping: si1 sou3 gaai1) * College Street - Êõ∏Èô¢Ë°ó ( Jyutping: syu1 jyun2 gaai1) * D'Arcy Street - ÈÅîÂ£´Ë°ó ( Jyutping: daat6 si6 gaai1) * Dundas Street West - ÁôªÊâìÂ£´Ë•øË°ó (Jyutping: dang1 daa2 si6 sai1 gaai1) * Glasgow Street - ÂòâÂ£´È´òË°ó (Jyutping: gaa1 si1 gou1 gaai1) * Grange Avenue - Âõ∫ÈÄ£Ê≤ªÈÅì (Jyutping gu3 lin4 zi6 dou6) * Grange Place - Âõ∫ÈÄ£Ê≤ªÂùä (Jyutping: gu3 lin4 zi6 fong1) * Grange Road - Âõ∫ÈÄ£Ê≤ªË∑Ø (Jyutping: gu3 lin4 zi1 lou6) * Henry Street - ‰∫®Âà©Ë°ó (Jyutping hang1 lei6 gaai1) * Huron Street - ÊõâÂÄ´Ë°ó (Jyutping: hiu2 leon4 gaai1) * John Street - Á¥ÑÁø∞Ë°ó (Jyutping: joek3 hon6 gaai1) * Kensington Avenue - ‰∫¨Â£´È†ìÈÅì (Jyutping: ging1 si6 deon6 dou6) * McCaul Street - È∫•Ê≠åÁõßË°ó (Jyutping: mak6 go1 lou4 gaai1) * Nassau Street - ÊãøÁ¥†Ë°ó (Jyutping: naa1 sou3 gaai1) * Oxford Street - ÁâõÊ¥•Ë°ó (Jyutping: ngau4 zeon1 gaai) * Phoebe Street - Ëè≤ÊØîË°ó (Jyutping: fei1 bei2 gaai1) * Queen Street West - ÁöáÂêéË•øË°ó (Jyutping: wong4 hau6 sai1 gaai1) * Renfrew Place - Ê∏©ÂØåÂùä (Jyutping: wan1 fu3 fong1) * Ross Street - ÁæÖÂ£´Ë°ó (Jyutping: lo4 si6 gaai1) * Saint Andrew Street - ËÅñÂÆâÂæ∑È≠ØË°ó (Jyutping: sing3 on1 dak1 lou5 gaai1) * Soho Street - ËòáË±™Ë°ó (Jyutping; sou1 hou4 gaai1) * Spadina Avenue - Â£´Â∑¥‰∏πÊãøÈÅì (Jyutping: si6 baa1 daan1 naa1 dou6) * Stephanie Street - Âè≤ËíÇËä¨Â∞ºË°ó (Jyutping: si2 dai3 fan1 nei4 gaai1) * Sullivan Street - ËòáÂà©Èõ≤Ë°ó (Jyutping: sou1 lei6 wan4 gaai1) Other Chinatowns in Greater Toronto Although the present downtown Chinatown is one of the more well known Chinese ethnic enclaves in Toronto, the city has a number of other neighbourhoods that have a high concentration of Chinese businesses, and people. Other Chinese ethnic enclaves in Toronto, and the Greater Toronto Area include: *East Chinatown, Toronto (1970s‚ÄìPresent): Centred at Broadview Avenue and Gerrard Street East (). Formed during the expropriation of First Chinatown and the increase of property prices in downtown/west Chinatown. The Chinese community from this neighbourhood originates from overseas communities from the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia, with some of Toisanese Chinese. *Agincourt, Toronto in (1980s-Present): Centred on Sheppard Avenue between Midland Avenue and Brimley Road (). The first suburban Chinatown in Toronto with its Chinese residents originating from Hong Kong and Taiwan. *Milliken, Markham and Toronto (1990s-Present): Centred near Steeles Avenue and Kennedy Road (). One of the first Chinese ethnic enclaves to extend into Greater Toronto, largely developed during the 1990s. The Chinese residents of the city originating from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. *Thornhill, Markham, and Richmond Hill (1990s-Present): Straddling the municipal boundary near Leslie Street and Highway 7 (). One of the first Chinese ethnic enclaves to develop in Greater Toronto, largely developed during the 1990s. The Chinese residents of the Richmond Hill originating from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. In popular culture The 1999 Chow Yun-fat film The Corruptor was set in the New York City Chinatown, with scenes filmed in the Chinatowns of New York and Toronto. The television series Kung Fu: The Legend Continues was filmed in Chinatown at Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street West for many episodes of its 1993‚Äì97 run. Filmed in Toronto, it portrays the Chinatown of an unidentified major U.S. city. On an episode of the 1990s series Due South entitled \\"Chinatown\\" (Season 1, episode 6), Toronto's Dundas and Spadina Chinatown stood in for Chicago's Chinatown. Toronto's Chinatown is featured prominently in the 2008 collection of short stories The Chinese Knot and Other Stories by Lien Chao. Toronto band Do Make Say Think have a song titled \\"Chinatown\\" on their 2002 album & Yet & Yet.

Career  After finishing her studies Szyszkowitz worked for the German Newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, the Austrian Radio channel ORF, the Austrian Newspaper Kurier and the Arbeiter Zeitung. From 1991 - 1994 she was editor for the magazin Profil. From 1994 bis 1998 she was Middle East Correspondent in Jerusalem for Profil, Kurier and the Swiss Magazin Facts. From 1998 until 2002 she was EU Correspondent for Format in Brussels. 2002 until 2010 she was Correspondent in Moscow for the magazin Profil and the Swiss Newspaper NZZ am Sonntag. She has lived and worked in London as correspondent for Profil, for the German Magazin Cicero and the Newspaper Falter. In 2007 she completed her Phd as Historian at the University of Vienna, topic of the publication was nationalism and terrorism. She published several books about terrorism in Russia, Europe and the Middle East. Since 2013 she writes a bilingual blog and is frequently in the media and a regular commentator on radio and television on topics such as European-, Austrian-, and British politics and Brexit. In 2016 Tessa Szyszkowitz founded the pro-European social media campaign Hug A Brit together with Birgit Maass, Paul Varga and others in order to keep Britain in the European Union. The campaign went viral in April 2016 and added a human touch to the Brexit campaign which divided the United Kingdom. Hug A Brit was nominated for the Europe State Award 2016 by the Austrian ministry for Foreign and European Affairs. The Europe State Award is an acknowledgement of initiatives that contribute towards promoting understanding of the EU and cohesion in Europe. Since 2017 Szyszkowitz is curating a lecture series called Philoxenia at the Bruno Kreisky Forum for international dialogue in Vienna: ‚ÄúPhiloxenia, the concept of hospitality, was cultivated in antique Greece. The love of the other seems to be especially necessary today, when populist movements threaten to eclipse rational thinking. It seems urgent to find alternatives to fear and xenophobia as driving forces of political processes.‚Äù Among her guests were Pankaj Mishra, Lisa Nandy, Fintan O‚ÄôToole, Elleke Boehmer, Jon Lansman, Annalisa Piras, Philippe Sands, Karin von Hippel and others. The lectures are usually in English. In 2018 Szyszkowitz published Echte Engl√§nder. Britannien und der Brexit. She argues that Brexit showed a deep identity crisis of the British society. ‚ÄûThe author manages to offer a comprehensive psychogram of the British nation‚Äú, writes a reviewer in the German weekly Der Freitag. The loss of the British Empire could never be properly compensated, Szyszkowitz writes, especially not with a Union of 28 Member States - among which the United Kingdom was only one of many natons with euqal rights. The consequences of Brexit should not be underestimated, the author argues: ‚ÄûEverything holy to British people is being questioned because of the exit from the European Union. Democracy, parliament, tolerance and even the proverbial calm. Old certainties are not relevant any longer. The Brexit-vote 2016 showed that British people are not sure anymore who they are‚Äú, Szyszkowitz writes. A reviewer in the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung agrees: ‚ÄûThe conclusions of the author are logical and correct.‚Äú Szyszkowitz also contributes to Carnegie Europe and the Royal United Services Institute for Security and Defence Studies.

Dourley (1936-2018) was a Jungians analyst, a professor of religious studies, and a Catholic priest. He taught for many years at Carleton University in Ottawa, his doctorate being from Fordham University. He received his Diploma in Analytical Psychology from the C. G. Jung Institute in Z≈´rich/Kusnacht. He is best known as a 'Jungian theologian' for his considerate interpretation of, and critical insights into, the psychology of Carl Jung. Often in context with contemporary religious thinking, e.g., the Protestant Paul Tillich, Dourley made inquires into the wider implications of Jung's views, which situates the source of religion in the psyche. Education Dourley came of age in Ottawa. In 1964 he was ordained a Catholic priest in the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. He then received his Licentiate in Philosophy and Theology at St. Paul University in Ottawa, his Masters in Theology at the University of Ottawa, and a M.A. at St. Michael's College, Toronto. In 1971 he was awarded his Ph.D. in Theology, at Fordham in New York City.Rosemary Murray-Lachapelle, \\"Fr. John Dourley 1936-2018\\" (2018). While at St. Michael's College, Dourley apparently studied with Gregory Baum, a participant in interfaith dialogue. At Fordham, Dourley's mentor Ewert Cousins advised him to read Carl Jung. At Union Seminary, Tom Driver introduced Dourley to the writings of Paul Tillich. Fr. Mooney introduced him to Teilhard de Chardin's.Schuyler Brown, 'Book review' (2009) at University of Toronto Quarterly. As professor From New York he returned to Ottawa, where he served as a professor at Carleton University, first at St. Patrick's College (1970-1979), then in the Religious Studies Department. He retired from teaching at Carleton in 2001.Rosemary Murray-Lachapelle, \\"Fr. John Dourley 1936-2018\\" (2018). Dourley had given the Marston LaFrance Fellowship Lecture at Carleton University in 1989.The Journal of Analytical Psychology (Routledge 1995), v.40, p.177. His first book was published in 1975.Tillich and Bonaventure (Brill 1975). It derived from his Ph.D. dissertation at Fordham on two theologians: the modern Lutheran Paul Tillich (1886-1965), and Bonaventure (1221-1274) of the medieval monastic tradition stemming from Augustine and Francis.About Tillich, Dourley wrote three books (1975, 1981, 2008) and three articles (1977, 1995, 1997). Work per Jung Early during his studies Dourley became aware of Jungian psychology. In 1980 at Z≈´rich/Kusnacht he was certified as a therapist, receiving the Diploma given to Jungian analysts. In Ottawa he then started private practice as a clinical therapist. \\"John... was one of the founding analysts of the first Canadian training program... of the Ontario Association of Jungian Analysts (OAJA). His analysands spoke of his compassion, wisdom, and presence.\\"Murray-Lachapelle, \\"Fr. John Dourley 1936-2018\\" (2018): Diploma, quote. Dourley's second book was published in 1981 by Inner City, a Toronto publishing company \\"founded in 1980 to promote the understanding and practical application of the work of C. G. Jung\\". It accepted Dourley's manuscript for its seventh title.The Psyche as Sacrament (Toronto: Inner City Books 1981), p.4 quote. As in his first book, Dourley wrote about the theology of Paul Tillich, here comparing it with the psychology of Carl Jung (1875-1961).On Tillich, Dourley wrote three books. Another comparative study was a 1995 article on Tillich and Jacob Boehme. Dourley revisited Tillich and Jung in his 1997 article and in a 2008 book. Four of Dourley's books were published by Inner City, following his first at Brill Academic. Three books were issued by Edwin Mellen. His last three were at Routledge. > The books were attractive to many and challenging to others, radical as they > were in the face of patriarchy and conventional theology. Like Jung, John > felt compelled to write, to communicate his understanding of Jung‚Äôs message > to the world. I‚Äôm bitten by this, he said, and I have to keep on writing. He > was writing to the day he died.Murray-Lachapelle, \\"Fr. John Dourley > 1936-2018\\" (2018): books, quote. Dourley taught Jungian subjects at various forums. At gatherings of the International Association for Analytical Psychology during the plenary sessions he gave lectures, e.g., at Barcelona 2004, Cape Town 2007, Montreal 2010, and Copenhagen 2013. At the University of Cambridge and at Yale University, he aired his interpretive views of Jung.Laura London, 'Interview' (2015): printed text. In 2012 he presented a paper at the 2d European Conference on Analytical Psychology in Russia, at St. Petersburg.Jung and his Mystics (2014), p.194. According to Daryl Sharp, his Toronto editor, \\"John was a very human priest, not at all 'holier than thou'. He was witty; he was kind and generous.\\" When asked about how he had avoided censure from the Vatican, Dourley said he was ‚Äútoo far under the radar.‚Äù Sharp also commented: > \\"Although [Dourley] was sometimes uncomfortable in the bosom of the Catholic > Church, he was able to reconcile his priestly calling with Jung‚Äôs tenets, > and he wrote eloquently of them both. ... [H]e never abandoned either his > early Jesuitical training or his midlife love of Jung, though to his > skeptical peers they might appear to be irreconcilable opposites. This > dissonance he explored... .\\"Quotes from Daryl Sharp, radar quote, \\"In > Memoriam\\" (2018). Sharp first met Dourley c.1948. Dourley traveled the complicated borderlands between religion and psychology. He drew out and further articulated many of the philosophic and spiritual implications inherent in Jung's work. Mystical views that informed it were often central to the discussions. Psyche as Sacrament The theology of Paul Tillich and the psychology of Carl Jung are here described and compared. Tillich often used a philosophical language of \\"ultimate concern\\" and employed an ontology, while Jung described the inner phenomena of archetypes, which affect the conscious ego. Yet in their appraisals of the human experience, each arrived at a somewhat similar point of view. Both Tillich and Jung understood that the apparent source of religious experience is found within the individual. Tillich sometimes called this source the \\"ground of being\\". For Jung it was the collective unconscious, variously qualified. Located in an autonomous realm of the psyche, this source was independent of the conscious ego's control or manipulation. Yet from its dynamic nature, numinous symbols came forth into human awareness which might powerfully impact an individual. The birth of such a symbol and the longevity of its potency depends on its concurrent acceptance by the human community, in faith and within culture. A sacred symbol may work directly on individual awareness or indirectly, unconsciously. As the psyche of each individual constitutes the medium through which humanity encounters the divine, Dourley interprets the psyche as analogous to a living sacrament.

Family Fran√ßois-Joseph de Choiseul, baron de Beaupr√©, known as the Comte de Choisel, was the son of Louis de Choisel, baron de Beaupr√©, and Claire-Henriette de Maul√©on-la-Bastide. He married Nicole de Stainville, his first cousin. Their children were Francois-Joseph de Choisel, marquis de Stainville, Nicole or Claire-Magdal√©ne de Choisel and Marie-Anne de Choisel. His wife died in Saint-Domingue while he was governor. Naval career Choisel was present at the bombardment of Algiers, where he was taken prisoner in 1696 and exposed to the discharge of French cannons. He was taken from there and saved by an Algerian corsair named Hali, who recognised him. This corsair had once been taken by a French vessel on which the Comte de Choisel was serving as ensign, then obtained his liberty by means of Choisel. Choisel became capitaine de vaisseau in the king's navy on 21 April 1705. Governor of Saint-Domingue Charles Auger, Governor of Saint Dominque, died in L√©og√¢ne on 13 October 1705 and was replaced as interim governor by Jean-Pierre de Charitte, the king's lieutenant of Tortuga and Le Cap. Choiseul was made governor of Saint-Domingue in place of the interim governor Charitte. A letter from the Secretary of State of the Navy of 27 July 1707 directed Choiseul to go to La Rochelle to await the departure of the ship that would take him to Saint Domingue, where he had just been appointed governor. Choiseul was formally appointed governor on 1 August 1706. A letter of 3 August 1707 briefed him on the meetings he would have with Charritte and Deslandes, who would tell him about the affairs of the colony and the measures he would have to take to restore discipline in the troops. He was received by the council of Le Cap on 18 December 1707, and by the council of L√©og√¢ne on 30 January 1708. A letter of 8 October 1708 discussed Choiseul's dispute with Charritte and Mercier, his unacceptable participation in trading in blacks with Cura√ßao and other subjects including the appointment of M. Mithon. Further letters were critical of his unauthorized actions and abuse of power, illegal slave trading and disorder among the troops. In 1709‚Äì10 Choiseul and the intendant Jean-Jacques Mithon de Senneville (1669-1737) decided that the new town of L√©og√¢ne was to be built on two sugar plantations about half a league from the sea, with a site chosen for its good water and lack of swampland. The town was to be built on a grid layout defined by the engineer Philippe Cauvet. The first priority was to build an imposing church. At this time the settlers were often forced to lend their slaves for public works projects. Choiseul noted in a letter of 1709 about L√©og√¢ne that this was resulting in bitter complaints. Death and legacy A letter of 23 September 1710 told Choiseul that the king had relieved him of his duties as governor of Saint-Domingue. He returned on a French ship commanded by Nicolas-Fran√ßois Hennequin. The transport ship was attacked by an enemy ship and taken after a fierce fight. Choiseul died of wounds on La Th√©tis on 18 May 1711. He was the 28th of his house to die in the service of King Louis XIV. He was taken to Havana, Cuba, where he was buried. Nicolas de Gabaret (1641‚Äì1712), a wealthy planter and governor of Martinique, was named as his successor but refused the position. On 22 September 1710 Laurent de Valernod, governor of Grenada and commander of Tortuga and the coast of Saint-Domingue, was appointed to replace Choiseul. He was received at Le Cap on 7 February 1711, but died in Petit- Go√¢ve on 24 May 1711. Jean-Pierre de Charite again took over as interim governor. Louis de Courbon, comte de Bl√©nac (died 1722), arrived two years later with the new title of governor of Saint-Domingue and lieutenant-general of the islands. He was not officially appointed until 1714.

It shows Viotti's vision of the Virgin Mary in August 1532 and his resulting miraculous cure. It belongs to the artist's mature period but is separate from his style of that time due to its attempt to be as faithful a reproduction of the miracle as possible.

Early years  Elgenmark was the son of the paediatrician, Olof Alfred Elgenmark, M. D. (1908‚Äì1972) and Elsa Judith Elgenmark, MA, (n√©e Hellsing) (1908‚Äì1937). As his mother died when Elgenmark was only one year old, his father left him to be raised by his maternal grandparents, Hanna Hellsing, (n√©e Hempel, 1873‚Äì1957) and the mechanical engineer at Bolinders, Karl Gustaf Fridolf Hellsing (1873‚Äì1946). Olle Elgenmark's parents were both very musically talented, and in the grandparents' home, music was always present. In 1958 Elgenmark married Agneta Str√∂m (b. 1937) with whom he subsequently had three children. When Elgenmark was a young boy he was given piano lessons, but it wasn't until the age of 15 that he became interested in the church organ and wanted to take organ lessons. As a student at √ñstra Real upper secondary school he got the opportunity to play the grand school organ for 15 minutes a week. In an interview Elgenmark told the following story: When he was 17 years old, he had private lessons in organ for the music director and organist Henry Lindroth. The latter asked after the first lesson: \\"Well, what are your plans for the future?\\" \\"I'm going to be an engineer\\", the boy said. \\"No, you're not! You are going to be an organist, nothing else!\\" the musical director said with emphasis. Elgenmark graduated from Royal Swedish Academy of Music (current Royal College of Music in Stockholm), where he studied Organ for Alf Linder and Harmony for Henry Lindroth from 1955 with the education equivalent of Master of Fine Arts in Church Music 1959, 1965 and 1966.  Organist in Stockholm  Elgenmark was 1959‚Äì1964 musician in Solna Church and 1965‚Äì1968 organist in the parish of Engelbrekt (Hjorthagen) where he conducted his own compositions for organ, choir, solo voices and orchestra. He also served in other churches and held organ recitals. In one of his early recitals before the age of 20, Elgenmark played works of Frescobaldi, Scheidt, Buxtehude and Bach. Elgenmark often visited the various churches in Stockholm to study the great organists of the 1950s, such as Oskar Lindberg, Otto Olsson and Waldemar √Öhl√©n. As a young student he got access to the organ loft to see when professor Otto Olsson played the organ in Gustav Vasa Church. Otto Olsson made a great impression on the young Elgenmark. In 1963 Elgenmark was a substitute for the successor to Otto Olsson and noticed the powerful handwriting of the professor. Elgenmark himself had a recognised beautiful fountain pen calligraphy in his handwritten music.  Compositions and inspiration  Elgenmarks compositions consist of hundreds of major and minor works: chorale bound works for organ, solo and choir songs, cantatas, arrangements and more. During his time as an organist in Stockholm and Norrk√∂ping, he also served for almost 20 years as a choirmaster. At that time, he wrote choir music adapted to his choirs in many musical settings. And \\"with his six extremely well- written and extensive organ symphonies Elgenmark appears as our [Sweden's] most prominent composer of organ symphonies\\" according to Ralph Gustafsson, professor in organ at Royal College of Music in Stockholm. \\"As a composer Elgenmark stands out from his Swedish peer's. His music's tonality is a development of Otto Olsson's romantic organ tonal idiom and thus diverges from the tonal language his colleagues use\\", the colleague Henric de Koster wrote in an article in Norrk√∂ping's Newspapers 1996. = Organ symphonies = The first of Elgenmark's organ symphonies, A Carillon Symphony in E-flat major, was written on commission from the organist in Stockholm City Hall, √Öke Lev√©n (a.k.a. Ralph Davier) (1930 ‚Äì2015),for a planned inauguration in August 1973 of the restored organ in the Blue Hall in Stockholm City Hall. The symphony was written 1972 ‚Äì1973 and the premiere of the symphony was planned to take place on that inauguration. But the organ suffered from major water damage and the concert was cancelled. Instead, √Öke Lev√©n premiered the Adagio from the symphony at a concert in Royal Albert Hall in London in September 1973. The symphony is 45 minutes long. The Adagio from A Carillon Symphony has been played on Sweden's Radio P2. In an interview, Elgenmark tells about the process of composing. \\"It often starts with an idea, or a notion. Then you see what you can do about it,\\" he says and talks about \\"seeing a subjects inherent possibilities\\". Bach is a musical model. The subject of the Second organ symphony, Sinfonia Breve (1975) in D-minor, came to Elgenmark when he was waiting at a railway station in London 1973. There had been a bomb attack there, and the passengers were delayed because they were body searched. The symphony was reviewed as \\"a piece of good quality\\" during the Swedish organ festival 1995 in Stockholm. \\"Elgenmark's music is high-romantic and orchestral and, sure, the composer sometimes flirts with impressionist sounds that even has an air of jazz.\\" \\"Overall, one can experience a certain mysterious timeless melancholy in this music\\" the music director and critic Michael Bruze wrote after Nils Larsson, organist at the H√∂galid Church in Stockholm, performed the Second organ symphony in 2014. The symphony is 18 minutes long and has been played on Swedish radio. Organ symphony No. 2 is represented at Svensk Musik, Swedish Music. The introduction motif for the Third organ symphony, Symphonie √©l√©giaque in E-minor, came to Elgenmark's mind in 1972, but it took until 1990 before the work was completed. Here, the second movement Sarabande stands out \\"with light and dark color tones\\", \\"music with intimacy and warmth without a trace of sentimentality\\". The symphony is about 35 minutes long and has been played on the radio. Organ symphony No. 3 is represented at Svensk Musik, Swedish Music. The Fourth organ symphony, A Festival Symphony in A-major, was written for the inauguration of St. Matthew's Church organ after the renovation 1990‚Äì1992 by organ builder Kenneth James & Son after the design of Elgenmark himself. Elgenmark applied for the position as organist in St. Matthew's Church, Norrk√∂ping in 1968, because it had a \\"top notch instrument\\" that a student friend had recommended, but it was in need of renovation. So, when the new organ was inaugurated in 1992 at the same time as the 100th anniversary of St. Matthew's Church, it would be showcased in all its splendor with a newly written symphony. Professor Hans Fagius played a shortened Festival Toccata from the Fourth symphony during the music festival The Sound of Norrk√∂ping (Norrk√∂pingsljud) 2015 and described the music as follows: \\"The movement begins as a typical French organ toccata with figurations in the hands over a pedal theme that is subject to an extensive variation. In contrast, in the middle comes a more quiet section with clear features of Swedish national romantic music. The main theme emerges in different polyphonic ways, then the initial toccata returns, now followed by a short canon between the pedal and the manual before the piece ends with a lavish tutti\\" The symphony is 45 minutes long and has also been played on radio. Organ symphony No. 4 is represented at Svensk Musik, Swedish Music. The Fifth organ symphony is called Retrospecition (in G-minor) and the name alludes on a compilation of English organ music from the 50s, especially the first piece in that collection written by Harold E. Darke. The three movements are an ouverture in sonata-form, a passagcaglia and one grand fugue, and it all emanates from the classic fugue subject. The Fifth symphony is monothematic, like the Sixth symphony, called Enigma (in C-major). Elgenmark wrote six organ symphonies and he began the Seventh organ symphony the last few years of his life and wrote one complete movement with a quadruple fugue in B-minor (one fugue on four subjects). The movement, probably intended as the Final, was premiered after Elgenmark's death by the organist Mark Falsj√∂ in St. John's Church in Norrk√∂ping on February 26, 2017. = Christmas oratorio = One of the compositions that stands out in Elgenmark's oeuvre is his magnum opus the Christmas Oratorio Ordet vart k√∂tt (The Word was made Flesh ) that he wrote between 1974 and 1982. The oratorio is written for choir, solo voices, recitative, congregational (assembly) song and symphony orchestra. The finale is a quadruple fugue. Many triple fugues are known, but it's rare with quadruple fugues in the music literature. The premiere was in St. Matthew's Church in Norrk√∂ping on January 10, 1982 and the conductor was the music director Hans Zimmergren. In a radio interview Elgenmark mentioned the following sources of inspiration for his oratorio: \\"As far as I know myself, I have been inspired a lot by English choral music, the Anglican tradition and a certain impressionist coloured church music particularly in the English field. I can mention a composer like Herbert Howells /.../ who has meant a lot to me.\\" A highlight from the oratorio is the choir song O, sunrise, (O soluppg√•ng) based on medieval antiphones. Elgenmark's Christmas Oratorio was last performed 2013 in St. Olai Church in Norrk√∂ping, conducted by the organist and music director David L√∂fgren.  Music style  What distinguishes Elgenmark's style is \\"an exquisite use of counter point, colorful harmony, a clear musical idiom and confident instrumentation\\". Always sticking to his romantic music ideals, regardless of the prevailing isms within organ music of the day made him an outsider as he was playing composers of romantic music, such as Guilmant and Widor, who were seen as decadent and impossible to play in Sweden in the 1960s due to the Organ Movement. Today he appears to have been a pioneer in the field of new romantic music and has many followers. On the question of what characterizes his style, Elgenmark answered in an interview at his retirement that \\"it is probably the harmony, that there is an extended chord thinking, something beyond the triad, an extension\\" and that he has been influenced by his \\"house gods\\" C√©sar Franck, Oskar Lindberg and Sigfrid Karg‚ÄìElert and a mix of Church mode, late romantic music and cautious impressionism\\".  Repertoire and improvisation  St. Matthew's Church 2012 Elgenmark played his own and other composers' organ works on Sweden's Radio P2 in the 80's and 90's. On the cathedral organ in St. Matthew's Church (Matteus kyrka) in Norrk√∂ping, where Elgenmark served from 1968 until his retirement, he held organ recitals every week for 27 years where he performed a broad organ repertoire. He played the great Bach works, sonatas of Rheinberger, symphonies of Widor, Otto Olsson's giant Credo symphony, music of Swedish romantics and his own works. Elgenmark's improvisation art was particularly great, especially his chorale preludes were greatly appreciated. In the end of his life he composed and completed organ music over 72 chorales. Elgenmark had on his 80th birthday come to the Opus number 47. He is buried at St. Matthew's Cemetery in Norrk√∂ping.

It is located on Wilmslow Road, and has an associated Church of England primary school. Worship at St Paul's consists of traditional Holy Communion (Book of Common Prayer and Common Worship) and occasional services of Choral Evensong or evening prayer in support of L'Arche in Manchester. History The Souchay family grave in St Paul‚Äôs churchyard St Paul's was built in 1841, when Withington was growing from a small Lancashire village into an urban district of Manchester. Prior to the establishment of St Paul's, the nearest Anglican place of worship to Withington was at the Church of St James, Didsbury. St Paul's was built on land donated by Wilbraham Egerton, 1st Earl Egerton to provide a place of worship for local people of Withington. The church was designed by the Mancunian architectural firm Hayley & Brown, who also built a number of churches around North-West England. Soon after the foundation of St Paul's, a school was established next to the church in 1844, St Paul's Primary School, also on land donated by Lord Egerton. In April 1847, during a visit to Manchester, the composer Felix Mendelssohn visited St Paul's to play the newly installed pipe organ. According to a churchwarden's 1896 account, Mendelssohn \\"played a service and gave a recital upon the organ and it was pronounced by him to be an excellent instrument\\". Mendelssohn's Manchester tour also included an organ recital at St Luke‚Äôs Church, Cheetham Hill. The composer had family and social connections with Withington; the first wedding to take place at St Paul's was that of a cousin of Mendelssohn‚Äôs wife C√©cile, and another cousin was married here in 1864. Architecture The church is built of red brick with stone coping. Its most prominent feature is a high clock tower with square buttresses and four pinnacles. The exterior has some Neo-Norman features, notably tall, rounded-headed lancet windows and a neo-Norman west door whose arch is carved with dog-tooth ornamentation. The building was extended in 1863 by J. Lowe, adding a chancel, a southern chancel aisle and organ chamber above, supported by Romanesque arches with foliated capitals. In 1921 the chancel aisle was converted into a war memorial chapel and a small apse was built onto the east end of the chapel. The interior was renovated in the 1970s, but retains some original Victorian fittings. The stained glass includes three lights at the east end by Ward and Hughes, and in the nave are two 1901 windows by local glassmaker Walter J. Pearce: a depiction of a young Queen Victoria and a stained-glass copy of Holman Hunt's Light of the World painting. In the chapel are four small windows commemorating the fallen of World War I, including a window dedicated to 15 former members of the sunday school who were killed in action. There are several wall memorials in the church. The oldest memorial is dedicated to Robert Tebbut, a benefactor of St Paul's who died in 1842, the year after the foundation of the church; the inscription reads, \\"to whose efforts the erection of this church is mainly due, and who is, alas! the first tenant of its vaults.\\" The churchyard has many Victorian headstones. A solid oak lych gate was installed in 1894 at the entrance to the churchyard, donated by local philanthropist Clayton Chorlton. In 2007 the gates were stolen during a Sunday morning service.

Originally from Anatolia, he authored one of the first treatises on Shatranj in 842, called Kitab ash-shatranj ('Book of Chess'). He was recognized as the best Shatranj player in the 9th century during the reign of al-Wathiq until his loss to al-Razi, just before or early into the reign of al-Mutawakkil. In his treatise al-Adli compiled the ideas of his predecessors on Shatranj. The book was lost but the problems he discussed survived in the works of successors. Mans≈´bƒÅt were end game scenarios, where victory was obtained either by checkmate or stalemate, or by baring the opposing king. From his work came a variant of the Dilaram problem, attributed to al-Suli and called Dilaram checkmate. In a manuscript from the early 15th century, a similar problem was accompanied by the story of a figure named Dilaram, who was the favourite slave of a certain chess player reduced to a desperate position in a match.

As its title suggests, it shows Nazarius and Celsus, patron saints of the church. It is one of the painter's most-discussed works and shows his gradual but decisive move towards Mannerism. It was only securely attributed to him from the late 20th century onwards. It includes several unusual compositional elements influenced by other artists. A restoration in 1987 also showed a huge number of pentimenti and corrections.

It was ordered from Grubb Parsons in 1931 by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and installed in a new dome building there. With a reflecting mirror 36 inches wide (91 cm) and a focal length of 4.57 meters (15 ft), it was the largest telescope in use at the Observatory in Greenwich until the late 1950s. Instruments for the Yapp reflector included two spectrographs, but also had an option for an eyepiece. It was overall a Cassegrain reflecting design on an equatorial mounting, and it had a 6-inch guide telescope also. One of the spectrographs was made by Adam Hilger, Ltd., and was delivered in 1937. The telescope was inaugurated on June 2, 1934 (Visitation day), opened by the First Lord of the Admiralty. The Royal Astronomer was there and noted that it had been 40 years since a large telescope was added to the observatory. The Yapp building dome was completed in 1932, and the telescope is located in area called the Christie Enclosure in Greenwich Park, with the building about 350 yards (320 meters) east of the main Observatory buildings. The drive for the equatorial, as well as dome rotation was done with electric motors. The original Yapp dome building at Greenwich was red brick, with a dome of iron lattice with paper mache covered with copper. In the late 1950s the telescope was taken down and moved to Herstmonceux (the whole institution was being relocated) where it was put in Dome B. The Yapp dome building was taken down and sent to the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope to house the planned Elizabeth telescope. An example of astronomical studies done with Yapp reflector, is Spectroscopic Observations of the Be Stars Œ∑ Cen, Œ≥ Cas and Œ¶ Per. This was a study done in the 1970s, with the Yapp using an echelle spectrograph to record the data. In 1984, the Yapp telescope was tested with an echelle spectrograph from Queen's University Belfast and a CCD camera.Bates, B. & McKeith, C. & Jorden, P. & Breda, I.. (1985). High dispersion spectroscopy trials using an echelle spectrograph with CCD camera. Astronomy and Astrophysics. 145. 321-323. Observations of the stars Alpha Cygni (Deneb) and Alpha Boo (Acturus) using this instrumentation on the 90 cm (36-inch) Yapp reflector were conducted in the summer of 1984. The results were published in the 1985 research paper High dispersion spectroscopy trials using an echelle spectrograph with CCD camera. The Yapp telescope along with the 98-inch Herstmoncuex INT telescope collected observations on stellar radial velocities between 1964 and 1971. The Herstmonceux site was used as an observatory into the 1980s, after which it then transition to a popular science museum, and the Yapp telescope remains there. The site closed in 1990s for astronomy and has been a noted tourist and education attraction, with preserved telescopes like the Yapp providing an example of a reflecting telescope. This was one of the biggest at Herstmonceux until the 98-inch Isaac Newton Telescope was commissioned in 1967, although it was moved to La Palma island off the coast of Spain by the 1980s. There was also a 38-inch Hargreaves telescope at Herstmonceux, but it was not put into action particularly.

It was on the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway with Trimsaran Road located to the south and Pontyates to the north of the East Kidwelly Junction. The station was renamed as Glyn Abbey in 1910. The name change may have been to avoid confusion with Upper Pontnewydd at Cwmbran and Lower Pontnewydd at Torfaen. Glyn Abbey was a country house located nearby and linked directly to Pont-newydd by a footpath. A rural area which once had a public house, the Smiths' Arms, at the nearby Pont-newydd hamlet. The Bryn Forest Inn was also close by on the road to Tre-Goch hamlet.OS 1:1m to 1:63k 1920-1940's Many old coal pits were once active in the area. The railway was originally a freight only line,1:1 million - 1:1 10K, 1900s built on the route of an old canal and prone to flooding, but stations were established due to pressure from the public. The freight service continued for coal traffic until 1996 by which time the last of the local collieries had closed down.Colonel Stephens SocietySN40SW - A, Surveyed / Revised:Pre-1930 to 1963, Published:1964 Infrastructure The station had one wooden platform on the western side of this single track line with a small wooden shelter.

Relation to castles Most Static Rook openings coincide with a castle development on the player's left side of board. In Double Static Rook openings, a Static Rook player's king is initially threatened from above by the opponent's rook which has remained on its starting square. Castles in Double Static Rook openings have a wide variety of forms that are dependent upon the specific opening used. Some openings like Fortress and Bishop Exchange openings have the king moved leftward away from the rook in compact castles while openings like Double Wing Attack and Side Pawn Capture have rather minimal castle formations with much less king safety in a trade off of defending wider areas within the Static Rook side's camp in order to defend against future piece drops. Double Static Rook openings =Double Wing Attack= Double Wing Attack is a Double Static Rook opening where both sides play Static Rook with the first several moves on each side being identical or very similar. Both sides advance their rook pawns to the middle rank 5. Then, golds are moved to defend each bishop's head. Afterwards, pawns on both rook files exchange. Then, the joseki branches off into several different josekis and strategies. Double Wing is most commonly played in modern times with both player's bishop diagonals closed initially. Double Wing Attack is one of the oldest Double Static Rook openings dating from around 1625 and preceding other openings such as Snowroof, Fortress, and Bishop Exchange.Hodges (1977) Tsukada Special Tsukada Special is a Floating Rook variant of the Double Wing Attack opening developed by professional Yasuaki Tsukada. No Guard =Side Pawn Capture= Side Pawn Capture has the same form as a Double Wing Attack opening with both players' bishop diagonals open. (Double Wing Attack with open bishop diagonals was more commonly played before the twentieth century while in modern times it usually keeps the bishop diagonals closed initially.) However, it deviates from Double Wing Attack when one player (usually Black) or both players capture the opponent's side pawn with their rook in a gambit move. The side pawns referred to are the pawns that are advanced in order to open both players' bishop diagonal (on 44 for White and 76 for Black). The games often have a different character compared with Double Wing Attack and can often feature very dynamic play. = Snowroof = The Snowroof strategy is named after the use of a Snowroof castle. This old opening predates the Fortress opening and was especially popular before the 1950s after which its popularity waned. Recently, the second decade of the 21st century has seen a surge of renewed interest in the strategy among professional shogi players. = Fortress = Fortress is a Static Rook opening as well as the name of a castle associated with the opening. When both players use a Fortress opening, it is known as a Double Fortress. The board diagram here shows the standardized first 24 moves of a typical Double Fortress opening where both players aim to build Fortress castles. Here the Fortress castles are not yet complete. At this point, the Double Fortress opening branches off into numerous strategies. =Bishop Exchange= Bishop Exchange is a Double Static Rook opening in which each player's bishop is captured so that they keep their bishops in hand. =Static Bishop Left Mino= Static Bishop Left Mino (Â±ÖËßíÂ∑¶ÁæéÊøÉ ikaku hidari min≈ç) is a Static Rook strategy used in Double Static Rook games by White when Black attempts a Fortress strategy.ÊñéËó§, ÊÖéÂ§™ÈÉé [ Shintar≈ç Sait≈ç ]. 2017.

It includes the Jefferson County Courthouse and the Old Market, which are separately listed on the National Register. Includes map. With The town was laid out in 1794. It was named Louisville pursuant to 1786 plans of the Georgia Legislature for a new state capital. Louisville served as capital of the state of Georgia for 11 years, from 1796 to 1806; the capital then moved to Milledgeville. Only one structure from that period is known to have survived. A statehouse building which was the capitol, was built; its site is now occupied by the Jefferson County Courthouse. Architect Willis F. Denny designed the Beaux Arts courthouse which was completed in 1904. Denny also designed two adjacent two-story brick commercial structures on the southwest side of Broad Street between Mulberry and Green Streets. These have Victorian-era commercial detailing (see photo #11). The commercial area declined during the 1920s and 1930s from the economic effects of the boll weevil and the Great Depression.

She fought under the British Empire flag and under Captain Alexander Dawson, and Lieutenant Andrew Baird. The name Arachne originated from Greek mythology about a Lydian maiden who challenged the goddess Athena to a weaving contest and was punished for her presumption by being turned into a spider. History HMS Arachne was built in Hills Yard at Sandwich on 18 February 1809 but was ordered in 1806. Based on a 1796 design, the Cruiser Class was identical to the Snake and Favourite Class of sloops, apart from the masts and an extra section inserted amidships to give extra length. These types of ships were by far the most mass-produced ships in the age of sail. From 16 January 1813 to 15 January 1814 she was employed in the West Indies. In 1824 HMS Arachne was converted to a ship sloop. HMS Arachne in the same year saw extensive action in the 1824‚Äì26 Burmese War. The Arachne's arrival on 11 September 1824 Commander Chad immediately took naval command in the Rangoon River in present-day Myanmar. She saw action in the defence of Kemmendine in 1824, operations in the Irrawaddy in 1824‚Äì25, and major action at Nepadee Ridge in 1825‚Äì26. Commander Chad transferred to HMS Alligator on 7 November 1825, replacing Captain Alexander who had died, and the command of the Arachne was taken by Commander John Francis Dawson. Commander John Francis Dawson died in the fighting at Nepadee Ridge on 2 December 1825. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Andrew Baird of HMS Boadicea. After Nepadee Ridge, a treaty was signed on 3 January 1826. The conflict resumed on 19 January only 16 days after the treaty. The force that fought at Nepadee ridge (of which HMS Arachne was a part) returned to Rangoon on 6 May 1826. After the war, HMS Arachne was sold outside of the naval service to a number of private owners. First, there was Bidwell in the port belonging to Exeter under a Captain Thurtell. Then there was a Captain Pearce in 1841‚Äì1842. 1845‚Äì1846 the ship must have changed owners as the records showed a S.Souter as the owner. In 1848 the records showed a company called Burns & Company as the owner with its captain being Captain Harris. The Arachne was finally placed under the command of Captain William Young of Hobart after a long time being under command of Captain H.Pearce. Captain Young was part owner of HMS Arachne, master of the whaling vessel Camilla, and part-owner of the Elizabeth Rebecca. The Elizabeth Rebecca and Camilla were lost in the shores of South Australia. The brig-sloop Arachne, under Captain William Young, left Hobart for the South Seas with cargo in its stores on 13 January 1848. Sinking In late May or early June 1848 the Arachne was anchored in Trial Bay, having on board 80 barrels of sperm oil. She sank in Yanerby and called for Trial Bay however it was too late for the ship was already under. The ship had a crew of 23 and it is known no people died with the ship sinking. > The whaling barque Arachne, of Hobart Town, Young, master, was driven ashore > in Trial Bay a short time since, in a gale of wind from the south-west.

Zamudio & R.B. Caballero (2019). Nepenthes erucoides (Nepenthaceae), an ultramaficolous micro-endemic from Dinagat Islands Province, northern Mindanao, Philippines. Phytotaxa 423(1): 21‚Äì32. It grows on a very thin substrate consisting of \\"lateritic nickel ore and decomposed chromite rubble, through to a clay derived thereof\\", which has been described as the most extreme ultramafic substrate known to host Nepenthes. Its taxonomic affinities are unclear, though it has been noted for its (apparently superficial) similarities to N. mantalingajanensis from Palawan. The species' ultramaficolous ecological setting has permitted the radiation of a peculiar set of associated traits, those being: \\"reduced leaf morphologies, sclerophyllous characteristics, hirsuteness and small stature\\", which have been associated similarly with the diminutive Nepenthes argentii of the windswept, ultramafic peak of Mount Guiting-Guiting, Sibuyan. The authors suggest that morphological analogues in the aforementioned species do not entail genetic association, and as such these may be considered as instances of morphological convergence- derived from associated conditions in ultramaficolous ecology- until further genetic analysis occurs. Nepenthes erucoides co-localizes with N. mindanaoensis (with which it hybridizes) and N. bellii (in zones of dense, protective vegetation). Nepenthes truncata occurs within the extent of the elfin forest below the 800 meter elevation band, N. merrilliana occurring regionally at elevations below 600 meters. The caterpillar-like emerging growths of this Nepenthes account for the species name erucoides The specific epithet erucoides, formed from the Latin eruca (caterpillar) and Greek -oides (resembling), refers to the densely hairy developing leaves, but particularly the tendrils, which are said to resemble the \\"exuberantly hairy caterpillars of certain erebid macromoths from the subfamily Arctiinae, such as those of the genus Arctia\\". The description describes this species as having perhaps the densest indumentum of any Nepenthes in its emerging foliage, but notes that this hair is rapidly dropped as the leaves develop. Nepenthes erucoides has been informally assessed by the authors as Critically Endangered under IUCN Red List (2012) criteria B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(i,ii,iii), as the species occurs within a reduced area and is threatened by declining habitat integrity.

It is situated northwest of Squamish, and north of Mount Tantalus, which is its nearest higher peak and the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. The Dione Glacier lies on the southern slope, and the Rumbling Glacier lies to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains east into tributaries of the Squamish River, or west into tributaries of the Clowhom River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1916 by Tom Fyles and his brother, John Fyles, via the southeast ridge. The mountain names in the Tantalus Range have a Greek mythology theme, and Mount Dione was named for Dione, the wife of Tantalus. The mountain's name was submitted by Neal Carter of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club, and was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Dione is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Dione.

Personal life Mary Elizabeth Harris was born on March 9, 1863 in Georgia to physician William Harris. She married Walter Florence Armor in August 1883. Career Armor often used the suffragette movement to advocate for prohibition in Georgia. Between 1903 and 1915, while serving in state and national offices with the WCTU, she lobbied for Congress to \\"protect women and children especially through prohibition legislature.\\" As a result, Armor is often credited for the passing of prohibition legislature in Georgia. Upon the passing of a State- wide prohibition law in 1907, the newspaper Atlanta Constitution described her as the voice \\"that aroused the Christian conscience of the State and put it on the march.\\" She predicted that \\"brewery stock in this country will not be worth as much as Confederate money was in 1865.\\" Armor was often nicknamed the \\"Georgia Cyclone.\\" She lectured and campaigned across the United States for the prohibition cause. Her speeches were so moving she was sometimes referred to as \\"Joan of Arc.\\" In one instances, she raised $7,000 for WCTU in one night through an empowering speech. As a result of her campaigning, Armor was the recipient of an honorary law degree from Wesleyan College in 1918. During the 1920s, she travelled to New Zealand to promote prohibition. However, Armor and the WCTU campaigned for prohibition on a racial based platform. On their maps of \\"wet and dry\\" counties came with the caption \\"Shall the Blacks rule the Whites?\\" As part of her movement, Armor attempted to get Fred Loring Seely of The Atlanta Georgian to allow the WCUT to publish prohibition propaganda in his newspapers. He refused as his newspaper was presenting the prohibition as an assertion of masculinity. Upon the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, she joined the League of Women Voters. Armor died on November 5, 1950.

The fort sat atop a small hill on a peninsula across the bay from Magong Harbor. As of today, little of the original structure remains.  Structure  The fort was built of compacted soil in a square with a side length of 55 m and a height of 7 m. On the southwest side facing the rest of the peninsula, the walls were covered with rock, and a trench was dug as well; the other three walls were covered with wood. Bastions were built on all four corners.  History  In 1622, the Dutch, based in Batavia, were seeking to establish a stronger presence in East Asia. A fleet of six ships led by Cornelis Reijersen attempted to capture Macau to disrupt the Portuguese's profitable Macau-Nagasaki route. However, despite outnumbering the defenders, Reijersen's fleet was defeated and repelled.Boxer, C. R., Fidalgos in the Far East, 1550‚Äì1770. Martinus Nijhoff (The Hague), 1948. p. 72 Frustrated, they turned to the Pescadores (modern day Penghu) to set up a base and coerce the Chinese into trading with them. Reijersen built his fort atop a hill known as Shetou Mountain (ËõáÈ†≠Â±±), forcing 1,500 locals into its construction. Allegedly, 1,300 of the workmen died due to starvation. From there, the Dutch began raiding Chinese trading ships in an attempt to \\"induce the Chinese to trade by force or from fear.\\" Their stay in the Pescadores, however, was short lived, ending in a successful Chinese offensive on the fort in August 1624. The Dutch and Chinese reached an agreement to destroy the fort, and the Dutch would move to Formosa (modern day Taiwan), where they built Fort Zeelandia, remaining there for 38 years. In 1895, Japanese Admiral It≈ç Sukeyuki rearmed the site as an artillery battery as part of the Japanese invasion of Taiwan. These cannons were removed in 1945 with the surrender of Japan.

Lay, 583 F.3d 436 (6th Cir. 2009), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals evaluated the addition of two Sentencing Guideline enhancements to Lay's sentencing in the lower district Court. These enhancements regarded the influencing of a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct and the use of a computer to persuade, induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. Following Lay's appeal, the Court of Appeals upheld the addition of these enhancements, affirming the lower district Court‚Äôs sentencing. This case is noteworthy because its mixed opinion, regarding the applicability of the two-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. ¬ß 2G1.3(b)(3)(A), paved the way for future cases to argue that the lack of Internet connectivity is sufficient in dismissing similar computer related enhancements.  Background  In June 2006, 53-year-old Dennis Lay made the online acquaintance of a 15-year-old minor (M.V.). Subsequently, for a period of approximately two months, Lay remained in close contact with M.V. exchanging messages online. In July 2006, Lay began communicating via telephone, making several calls to M.V.‚Äôs house. After numerous occasions where M.V.‚Äôs mother answered when Lay called, Lay sent M.V. a package containing \\"a mobile phone, clothing, and over $200\\". In the later part of July, M.V.'s mother learned that M.V. claimed to be in love with Lay and wanted to travel to California to live with him. M.V‚Äôs mother then alerted Ohio police who discovered the mobile phone Lay had sent. An officer, using this phone, called Lay. Lay claimed to not know M.V.‚Äôs age and hung up when asked further questions. Despite having been informed of M.V.‚Äôs age, Lay continued communicating with M.V.; however, all of these subsequent communications were done over the phone or through writing, not an online medium. In November 2006, Lay mailed a package to one of M.V.‚Äôs friends with instructions to deliver it to M.V. \\"Inside the package was two letters, four pictures, a plastic ring sizer, a music CD, a half-dollar coin, and $200.\\" These letters detailed plans for meeting up at a hotel and instructed M.V. to avoid telling anyone of this plan. In the following days, Lay continued to have numerous sexually explicit conversations with M.V. over the phone, and further discussed how he planned to trick M.V.‚Äôs mother into allowing M.V. to leave for the weekend. However, unbeknownst to Lay, M.V.'s mother had discovered Lay's letters and had subsequently allowed police to record these phone calls. On December 29th, 2006 Lay flew from California to meet M.V. Upon landing at Hopkins Airport, Lay was subsequently arrested by FBI agents waiting for him in the baggage claim area.  Court findings  In January 2007, a federal grand jury indicted Lay with a single count of knowingly traveling in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2423(b). Lay pled guilty to this charge in March 2007; however, following a sentence hearing in July 2007, the district Court recommended the addition of three Sentencing Guideline enhancements namely: \\"U.S.S.G. ¬ß 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) for unduly influencing a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct, U.S.S.G. ¬ß 2G1.3(b)(3)(B) for use of a computer to entice a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with a minor, and U.S.S.G. ¬ß 3B1.4 for using a minor in the commission of the crime.\\" Lay contested these enhancements, testifying before the Court. Having heard Lay‚Äôs testimony, the Court ruled to dismiss the enhancement under U.S.S.G. ¬ß 3B1.4 but upheld the enhancements under U.S.S.G. ¬ß 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) and U.S.S.G. ¬ß 2G1.3(b)(3)(B); sentencing Lay to \\"imprisonment for 84 months, followed by 20 years of supervised release.\\" Lay appealed his sentence, arguing that it was both \\"procedurally and substantively unreasonable\\". The Court of Appeals later affirmed the district Court‚Äôs decision and Lay's sentencing. = Undue influence = Refuting the enhancement for unduly influencing a minor, Lay argued that it was M.V.‚Äôs idea for Lay to meet and, consequently, M.V. lied to and manipulated him. Therefore, he proposed, M.V. influenced him to the same degree that he might have influenced M.V., thus making such an enhancement inapplicable. Addressing this, the district Court recounted Lay‚Äôs testimony, wherein he described M.V. as troubled, vulnerable, and having experienced family problems, and the unidirectional material relationship he shared with M.V. Because of this and Lay‚Äôs testimony, which ‚Äú[served] as nothing more than an attempt to divert [blame]‚Äù, the district Court concluded that Lay was the sole manipulator. Thus, the district Court rejected his argument. The Court of Appeals upheld this ruling, noting how Lay ‚Äúhad not made a factual showing sufficient to overcome the applicable rebuttable presumption that the age difference between Lay and M.V. indicated undue influence.‚Äù Continuing, the Court of Appeals expanded upon the district Courts ruling by highlighting how the facts of the case were ‚Äúconsistent with a manipulative adult building a relationship with a minor for the purpose of eventual sexual activity.‚Äù = Use of a computer to entice = Regarding the enhancement for using a computer to entice a minor, Lay argued that such an enhancement was inappropriate because none of the communication about sexual conduct had occurred via a computer. Addressing this, the district Court argued that because ‚Äú[Lay] met the victim in this case through the use of a computer‚Äù with the goal, as shown through the facts of this case, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with a minor. Therefore, the court concluded, the advisory guideline of using ‚Äúa computer or interactive computer service to entice, encourage, offer, to engage‚Äù in such activities is sufficient. Subsequently, the district Court rejected Lays argument for, while ‚Äúperhaps a matter for further review‚Äù, the ‚Äúmere use of a computer to contact, communicate with, and entice a fifteen- year-old to begin a relationship was sufficient for the enhancement to apply‚Äù. However, this generalized application of ‚Äúmere use‚Äù was not unanimously supported by the Court of Appeals, as Justices argued over the stipulation of ‚Äúinvolving a computer or interactive computer service [to entice].‚Äù  Ruling  = Majority opinion = The majority opinion upheld the district Court‚Äôs ruling, arguing that the Internet allowed sexual predators to ‚Äúmake explicit proposals of sexual activity or merely to strike up friendships with potential victims‚Äù far more readily and ‚Äúmore insidiously, than would be possible offline.‚Äù Then, addressing the dissenting, the majority argued how the restricting of the enhancement to only apply to sexual predators that develop relationships with minor victims, ‚Äúso long as the ultimate consummation is first proposed through online communication, would not serve the purpose of this enhancement.‚Äù = Minority opinion = The minority opinion, whilst agreeing with the majority in regards to the potential impact of the Internet, rejected the idea that such an enhancement could be applied so universally. Rather they argued, because both the district Court and majority concede that there was ‚Äúno evidence that Lay ever discussed sexual activities over the computer with the victim‚Äù, the enhancements requirement for a computer thereby invalidates any further inquiries.  Impact  The courts emphasis on the importance and relevance of Internet connectivity in this case paved the way for subsequent cases, like that of United States v. Kramer 631 F.3d 900 (8th Cir. 2011), to question the applicability of similar enhancements when the behavior occurs entirely offline.  See also  United States v.

This software enables the user to add and use userscripts, which are JavaScript programs that can be used to modify web pages. History Tampermonkey was first created in May 2010 by Jan Biniok. It first emerged as a Greasemonkey userscript that was wrapped to support Google Chrome. Eventually the code was re-used and published as a standalone extension for Chrome which had more features than Chrome's native script support. In 2011, Tampermonkey was ported to Android, enabling users to use userscripts on Android's internal browser. By 2019, Tampermonkey had over 10 million users. Tampermonkey is one of 13 extensions on the Chrome Web Store to have at least 10 million users. =Chrome manifest V3= In January 2019, Biniok wrote in a Google Groups post that the new Chrome manifest V3 would break the extension. The new manifest would ban remotely accessed code which Tampermonkey is dependent on. The userscripts use code that is created by developers not at Google, and instead is created by third-party developers at places like Userscripts.org and Greasyfork. This code is inserted after the extension is installed, however the manifest requires the code to be present at installation. Controversy On January 6, 2019, Opera banned the Tampermonkey extension from being installed through the Chrome Web Store, claiming it had been identified as malicious. Later, Bleeping Computer was able to determine that a piece of adware called Gom Player would install the Chrome Web Store version of Tampermonkey and likely utilize the extension to facilitate the injection of ads or other malicious behavior. The site stated, \\"This does not mean that Tampermonkey is malicious, but rather that a malicious program is utilizing a legitimate program for bad behavior,\\" going on to call Opera's blacklisting the extension for this reason a \\"strange decision\\".

Whilst these teams gained little success internationally, they were consistently the best team nationally and rain was consistently the best player on these teams. In May 2015 he was then poached by Team Kinguin who were one of the first organizations to experiment with international rosters. This team peaked with a quarter-final placement at the major tournament ESL One Cologne 2015 where there went out with a loss to TSM. Following this promising showing the roster was picked up by G2 eSports, due in part to Kinguin's withdrawal from eSports. The team again made quarterfinals at a major, this time DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca 2015, losing to eventual winners EnVyUs. The roster was again bought, this time by FaZe Clan for a record-breaking $700,000,https://www.dailydot.com/esports/faze-csgo- most-expensive-team/ but by this point, many of the players from the original international Kinguin lineup had been replaced, with only the core trio remaining. Under the FaZe banner, this trend continued with eventually all of the roster being replaced bar rain, with the roster first gaining success with victory at Starseries' Sl i-league season 3 in April 2017. Though whilst rain performed admirably, the roster failed to repeat success, leading to more team changes until the team eventually ended up with what many considered the most talent dense team to date.https://www.redbull.com/gb-en/faze-clan-csgo- interview Whilst this team had early success, with two back to back flawless victories at the Eleague CS:GO Premier 2017 and ESL One New York 2017, the team did not manage to find consistency and was largely considered relatively dysfunctional following a 2nd place finish at the 2018 Boston Eleague Major. Whilst rain's performance got him several accolades in 2017 and 2018, since then his personal level had declined with that of his team, and both his and his team's performance was hit or miss as the team tried out several different players in an attempt to complete the roster. This process is still ongoing come November 2019, where the most recent additions have revitalized the team somewhat despite rain's personal level being somewhat below average since May.
